The most recent comments below
28:03 the best part
5:18 my favourite crash out
Freddy: "Not now, Gregory. I'm busy saving Gregory."
Most endings being comic book strips is such a let down - you play the whole game only to see...crayon drawn images?!
THERE WAS LITERALLY SAID THAT YOU COULDNT USE RECHARGE STATIONS !!!
30:20 Do it. I dare you, Mark. (I said mark, not other weirdos online)  DO IT MARK. COME FIND ME I DARE YOU.....cuz i wanna say hi and i aint got no vid cons in my city soooo....
28:01 FREDYAHHHGHGHg
27:41
27:44 This timestamp marks the best fnaf event of the century
27:53 scared me BAD LOL
They spent it all on the intro haha
Came back just for 28:30
Classic Freddy running past mark episode
not mark losing his absolute mind with the betrayal
27:53 monty chasing him
I like to think Amy is in the other room doing some work and randomly through the day she hears mark yell out, FREDDY YOU BITCH!!!
I think this is the one security breach video where he lost his mind the most
I'm thinking the game has been stop 15:28
Freddy abandoning Mark in his time of need lives rent free in my head and will always live rent free.
Mark deadpan exclaiming "wha...I saw a mission pop up that said 'Plan A'" while being Mooned to death will never stop being a gut buster. 😂
28:35 best one for sure
Freddy: “No time to talk Gregory, I need to find Gregory.”
"Good news... it is almost a 🐓" got me laughing so much it hurts 😭
This game basically makes no sense because Scott gave the company the pieces they needed for the basis of the game but either didnt want to or was hesitant to give Steelwool the whole overarching storyline because he didnt want the storyline to be clear in the game, just like in his other games. However, either steelwool misnderstood or really wanted a clear story so tried to piece one together from what Scott gave them resuting in really good base mysteries but really bad wonky connections between them. Thats why you get the painfully obvious dialoge and connections like when Freddy points out the coincidence of Vanessa + Bunny = Vanny.
Mark screaming as Freddy runs off is absolute comedy gold
Mark: *chilling* Monty: *summons* Mark:FREEEEEEEEEEEDDY!!!! Freddy: *runs but walks past him and goes away* Mark:FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!!!!!!!!!!
The way Vanessa said "come to the main stage." Is crazy 💀💀
Places like the theatre is one reason Mark should play threw again. There is now actual jokes for Joke-bot.
Me: and this is the room where the king of fnaf screams for having to put the eyes in Freddy for the hundredth time 😂😂  3:52
Mark: This can’t be the end I refuse it, I refuse it, I refuse it to be the end  Me: well there’s 3 videos left of security breach in this playlist so well done predicting mark 😂
28:30 all pain of a man in one moment😂
Best intro
For anyone searching for the infamous meme, it's at 27:55
Markiplier is angry at the ending being a comic when the first 2 games' endings are literally a piece of paper
its almost cock (or cluck idk)
28:43 FREDDY YOU BI*CH! FREDDY!!!!! FREDDY!!!!
28:00  Friday
imagine you're an animatronic tech and you just leave the night before knowing freddy needs fixing but every issue known in all the bots is software, then you come back in the morning,  chica, roxy, and monty are all DESTROYED and freddy has some parts of each of them, and he's FILTHY, and your like "vanessa what the fuck happened here" and you either get told the truth "a toddler figured out how to destroy all the bots and how to do parts and service" or some other shit but now you have to deal with THAT
Mark’s freddy impression is top peak
Freddy: hm.. where did he go? *walks past* Mark: FREDDY YOU B*TCH! FREDDYYYY
Obviously it’s not gonna end on one night. Gregory will still be around four more nights. No worries!
The decision to take away both your ability to save AND your ability to charge Freddy is still one of the stupidest decisions they made in the entire game.
Moon Man kills him when he's inside Freddy?
27:53 you’re welcome. Watch from here on.
The ending of this game still makes me so mad. It just feels like they rushed it and didn’t have time to finish it properly
28:43 Just want to leave this here 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
at first i was like mark its not funny, then i was hit with the did they run out of money for the budget?
LOL Freddy Just Ditched Mark!😂🤣🐻🎩
28:22 I'm not surprised Freddy couldn't find him, he was just running around repeatedly pressing the call button. 😂
The fact that they purposefully do not let you save after putting in Freddy's eyes is one of the msot player hostile, mindless, stupid, cruel things a game developer could do. It serves no purpose and is incredibly stupid.
2025 anyone?
Good news it almost a cluck 🐔 I'm dying rn😂😂😂😂😂
Why does it open at 6 AM? I feel like realistically, it'd close at 10 or 11 and not 12 and would open at like 8 or 9 and not 6!
This reminds me of that encounter in the bunker in the game stay out of the house were a dying man talks to Roxanne saying you must stop the demon downstairs you have to destroy this entire facility 17:56
28:44 Markipiler: FREDDY! YOU BITCH!
5:19
Freddy saw what Monty did to Bonnie and said NOPE   Thanks for the laugh, Mark. Really needed it today (again)
[28:02 | 28:06]  [28:21]  [28:32]  [28:45 | 28:47]  [28:54 | 28:56]  [29:01 | 29:03]   This is the best reaction a ever see.
15:19 hear me out guys..
Mark: "FREDDY!" Freddy: Casually waiting his turn on the stairs Mark: "FrEdDy!!!!!!" Gets jumpscared Freddy: "Well I guess there is no child."  edit: This has made my day Thanks Mark!
Why when Venessa says to go check the main stage is it so sexual sounding, what is she trying to do seduce him, that’s like pedophilia on top of incest, canonically, but still she says it so sexual like it just threw me off
28:43  FREDDYYYY
came back to watch this play threw because it was great the first time i watched it but i didn't remember that freddy said "you are my superstar" at the first ending and i wasn't prepared for the amount of tears that just rolled down my faceeeeeeeee. MEGA SADNESSSSSSSSSSSS
26:10 I think you would be refering to the fact the game may have been rushed. Like they had a development crunch towards the end as they had to meet a deadline. Like what happened to Halo 2 and Sonic 06. Its sad it happens because it really can take away a lot from a game.
28:40 is so funny
He has no idea how freddy works
If you go back and watch the teaser trailer for this game, it was very different than the final product. Nearly everything from the teaser trailer was scrapped or re-worked into something different.
The true ending is the princess quest ending
I actually think they just ran out of budget/time after a sudden point in the game
“You are my superstar…” I’m bawling my eyes out over here
Mark: *calling for Freddy* Freddy: *runs past Gregory* Monty: 'Um... he's literally at the bottom of the stairs.' I'm pretty sure Monty knows what Freddy was doing, he literally stopped and just watched how fast Freddy ran by. And I'm pretty sure many people already know this, but the reason why Freddy ran past Gregory is due to the fact that Freddy always shows up at the location where he was first summoned at.
28:44 :)
Mark: "FREDDIE!" Freddy: sorry take a number and wait your turn
28:43 I could not stop laughing when he was yelling “FREDDY!!!!!!!!!!” Then he ran right past him and mark had to keep running away from Monty
I love how Mark just stumbles into a secret ending that people can not even unlock sometimes
I wish I could save before I finish
100%
12:04 dude 6:00 AM is after I wake up
"FREDDYYYYYY" Dumbledore said calmly
2:58 he didn’t necessarily detect any injury, he just detected that you were broken, and that he had to put you back together
markiplier?…I’m ok with this 🌈👍
5:05 LOL
this has gotta be one of the worst games ever made oh my lord.
FREEEEEEDDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYY
I played this game on the PS5 Everytime I called Freddy he would always just appear behind me. I never saw him run. Is it a setting? I didn’t like him just appearing though thin air
Mark still not getting that Freddy doesn't go to him directly when the button is pushed but instead goes to WHERE the button was pushed at is both hilarious and aggravating 🤣
Why did vanessa turn seductive
Every time I watch this episode I laugh so hard and the animation that goes along with the scene is so hilarious
Freddy ran right past him😭😭😭😭😭  I'm dying of laughter
29:20 Either Freddy just sprints to where you called him specifically or his AI was glitching out.
In recent updates, they added a way to save after selecting the option to save, which is smart because no one wants to make so much progress and then die to Monty or endoskeletons or something and lose ALL that progress.
Mark: FREDDY!!!!! Freddy: *waits his turn on the steps* Mark: *gets caught* FREDDY YOU BITCH!!!
Gregory, running for his life: "Freddy!!! I need your help!"  Freddy: "Not now, Gregory! I have to save Gregory!"  Also, I love how we all like to imagine that this was caused by a bug, but the mechanic was working exactly as intended. Mark just misunderstood what it did. He thought the button was to call Freddy directly to you, but it actually just creates a way point that Freddy will go to so, no matter how much Mark spammed, Freddy would've never gotten to him because of all the breadcrumbs Mark was leaving behind.
best scene part 😂 28:40
28:00 is the best meme ever
3:16 Freddy let me in you
"FREDDY YOU BITCH" gets me everytime
So, to explain what the hell happened there: when Freddy is successfully pinged in this game, he runs to the location of the ping, not to Gregory specifically. Each ping sets up a node for Freddy to run to, and he goes to these nodes sequentially if more pings are added (in other words, you need to not go crazy with the pinging). The next ping in sequence happened in the Daycare Theater. That’s why he charged past Gregory.  It’s extremely dumb, and I’d much rather the ping set up a node on Gregory that moves with him and deletes when Freddy reaches Gregory (maybe it deletes when Freddy’s within a certain distance from Gregory, say half a meter from him), but that’s how it works in this game.
if you told me glam rock Freddy had a lobotomy, i wouldn't be surprised
That's why freddy is like that in ruin bc gregory took freddys head and left his body there and then cassie found freddy his head is gone and his stomach is wreaked ig so that's what happened. And it's similar to roxy, chica and monty.
27:50 `Best scene in Mark's whole FNAF series` •Mark gets caught by security bot• "God-! How-?? You- Ohh my god noo- Not Monty, not Monty, not Monty, not Monty! I can't stop Monty! I can't stop Monty! Freddy! Freddy! Please, Freddy! Freddy, now!" Click "Now! Freddy! Now! Now, Freddy!" Click "Freddy?! Click "Freddy?!?"  "Freddy! [Click] I need you right now!!"  Monty: "Hey-" "Please be-" Monty: "-little guy!" "Oh god, oh god, that's not Freddy." Click "Fredday!!!" Click "FREDDAYY!!" Click click click click click "FREDDAYY[Click]!!!" "No- Oh noo! No! No! No! No! No! Noo!" Monty: "Hey, little guy!"  Click "FREDDAYY[Click]!!" "FreddAYY!!" "Freddy, please-! Oh my god-! No-! Not like this! Not like this! Please? Uh-" •Freddy runs past Mark when Mark needs him most• "Get me in! Get me in-! FrEDDAYYY!!" •Mark turns into teenage girl going through puberty• "FREDDaYYYY[Click]!! [Click]YoU bITCH[Click]!![Click]!!" Monty: "Hey, lit-" FrEDDAyYYYY!!!" Monty: "-tle guy." "Fre-Freddy- Don't wait your turn-! God damnit. Freddy," "Freddy??" "Wha- Oh my god, no! No! No! Not like this! Not like this! Fredddayyyy!"  "Oh my god, oh my god. Are you serious right now? You [click] cannot be serious." "Freddy."  "FFreddy!" •Mark gets nabbed by Monty• "Oh My God, FREDDAYYY!!"  "FREDDY, YOU BASTARrRD!!" ... "Alright guys, that'll do it...for this..episode.."
27:57 FREDDYYYYYY
Imagine if they'd actually animated Vanny - a human - getting "disassembled..."
27:52  Freddy: *runs past and doesn’t care about him getting killed* Mark: *spamming the call button and screaming*
That part was way to funny😂 28:43
Hu
FREDDYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
28:41 Freddy: Wait a minute, I'm going to get some pizzas.
I guess the endings were just comic type shit for them. I don’t fucking know.
JUMPSCARES:  Moon Drop 3:33 Moon Drop 7:29 Moon Drop 10:45 Moon Drop 12:23 Security Bot 27:53 Security Bot 28:27 Montgomery Gator 29:14  Original comment by Stairs_Eidts
I know this is late, but Freddy will go to the last place you pinged your FazWatch to summon Freddy. He will not come to you which is why he goes past you because he's going to the ping and not the player. I learned this when Mark first summoned Freddy and he went past him in an earlier episode. It didn't make sense why he did that until that episode. So, its intention is for you to be in a safe place and then ping for Freddy and Freddy will come to the safe place you are at so that you're not running around constantly pinging like Mark was.
28:40 Top 10 anime betrayals
IT WAS NOT A TABLET IT WAS A BIG BUTTON
27:53 this entire segment has my dying😭 freddy is just so lost
I got stressed out during the freddy thing. Why didn’t he go in the bathrooms and wait for Freddy there
Imagine if shortly after 17:58, an employee walks in, sees Chica and Roxy with missing parts, Freddy dead on the ground, Vanessa literally torn apart, and a kid just sitting unscathed.
Mark wouldnt have to repeat the 6am thing a million times if hed have just listened and not tried to find 100 other things to do... hes only making himself frustrated😂😂
It was 6:00
Probably not running out of the budget, but based on information back then. The Team and Scott and his family getting harassed and death threats.  All because Scott donated money to the Republican party. Its why he stepped down and away from Game design.
28:03 Freddy pls Freddy pls now now Freddy now Freddy?
29:15 Freddyyyyyyyyy🤣
28:40 😂😂😂
I just realized something.  Couldn't Freddy have just hidden Greg in his room for the night and if the security guard comes just hide him?
Markiplier didnt find me yet
Freddy, playing as a father figure to Gregory, ended up trying to get the milk.
And i would have gotten away with it, if it wasn't for you meddling kid AHH game
No one’s talking about the beginning, that shit’s funny
I know Vanny is evil and all...  But man there is something disturbing about commanding robots to "disassemble" a human female...who is made of flesh and blood instead of scrap metal and screws...
3:29
18:01  mark cannot speak anymore😂
3 yrs later still a good game
Mark: WHY DO I KEEP GETTING JUMPSCARED IN FREDDY?! Moon: * Shrugging Tom meme *
It's really interesting coming back to this game now, so long after the initial release and the ruin dlc, and seeing all the jank from when it was fresh
28:17 FREDDYYYYY,  FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,  FREDDYYYYYYY  got me rolling 😂
Also, Freddy in the Vanny ending has Monty's claws regardless
28:00 best part in the whole series
this video is actually so infuriating. GO TO THE ENTRANCE!! ITS SO SIMPLE!!
10:47 Plan A: Gregory fucking dies.
Game: "The charging stations are now out of commission." Mark: "IM AT THE CHARGING STATION, WHY ISN'T IT WORKING? I SHOULD BE SAFE HERE"
28:00 here’s where Mark is running for his life if anyone is interested
Wow i can't believe it has already been 3 years since this came out what the heck-
“FREDDAAIIIIIIIIII!! FREDAAIIIIIIII FREDDY FREDDY PLEASE FREDDY PLEASE FREDDY- FREDDY YOU B4$T4RD!!”
Aside from the added Lore and stuff, this game is an absolute joke
27:40
"Nothing can hide from me with these new eyes!!" "FREDDY HELP???????????" "Where are you :("
moon drop is on freddy
Mark genuinely tweaking out over security breach will always be funny to me
Love your video's Mark
Mark be wheezing 18:15
Bro when markiploer said what happened 😂😂😂 and said it was moon guy but I guess it was actually the time limit cuz it was 5:59 when that was about to happen
This game is so broken and unfinished, it's a whole new art of its own
17:42 i just realized the hole in freddys stomach and gregory leaving with freddys head was why freddy is why freddy has a big open “mouth hole” and no head in fnaf security breach ruin😅 did anyone else just figure this out?
Bro crashed out when Monty was chasing him
28:42 the worst betrayal in the world
Every time I come back to the game, I see how much potential this game had. But it felt rushed, sooo unfinished (way too many little details and dialogs that are incomplete). I wish they took advantage of all that they put in this game. So much potential 😭
28:40
I have been stuck on the ‘upgrade Freddy’s eyes’ part  for the last few days now ‘cause I keep accidentally pressing the wrong button 😅
Vanny: “disassemble Freddy” Bots: *proceed to throw Freddy’s body parts all over the place* Mark: 👁️👄👁️
game : charging stations don't work anymore Mark: I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that
Game:It is almost the end! Me, with 4 videos on the playlist left: nuh uh
Mark: FREDDY!  Freddy: hey wait what did this employee only sigh say?
is nobody gonna talk about the first 7 seconds of the video
FREDDAAAAAAAYYY
FREDDY YOU BITCH! FREDDDDYYYYYYYYY 😂😂😂😂 28:45
Markiplier just made fnaf history.  Lol
7:25 7:56 28:02
watching mark try and fail to get freddy multiple times is the funniest part of this gameplay by far
Did anyone else notice how after each upgrade Freddy looks more dirty and cracked?
THE LORE!!!! MORE DISSAPERANCES THE LOORRRREEE!!!!!!
Mark: screaming for his life* FREDDY!!!  Freddy: I can see so well with Roxy's eyes but were a rec you Gregory *runnig past him like 4 times*😂
I meen 29:17
29:19
Omg freddy freddy you basterd
27:40 got me dying of laughter
28:40 has me rollllingg 😂 he ran right past you
Mildly upsetting that it's the unique and interesting ending animation that makes Mark ask if they ran outta budget, and not the endless amounts of bugs and glitches he's encountered throughout the game🫤
13:41 Freddy really said "This is my design."
mark: "FREDDY HELP HELP FREDDY FREDDY HELP" Freddy: must have been the wind
Wow they really ran out of budget at that vanny ending huh
28:00 best comical thing to happen to you mark i believe someone actually took this scene and added i think it’s the chicken song 😅(i can’t remember the name of the music but it’s used in comical chase scenes)
My question is, why was Vanny/Vanessa acting so seductive for no reason, especially towards a child??
In case anyone doesn’t know they updated 6 AM so that there is an additional save station in the atrium that is only active at that time and the only save station active
17:49 i think that the weird sound in the background is gregory making these comics, because in ruin you can collect those comics
0:00 9:53 14:25 17:45 24:30 25:30 28:00
28:42 "gemme in gemme in. FREDDY!!!"  Freddy: "Not now Gregory, I'm trying to find Gregory."
Lmfao  Mark: FREDDY! Get me in, get me in! FREDDY! FREDDY YOU BITCH! FREDDY! FREEEEEEDDY!   this is my favourite part of security breach that Mark does
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation?" I'M DEAD
lol 😂😂😂😂 Iam dead at the ending mark lost his mind “you bastard” 😂😂
5:08 "One moment Gregory I need to find Roxy's Onlyfans password"
27:58  around the freddy betrayal part
15:35 if that was my reaction that I chose vanny I would have said I’ve should have leave 😅
27:48 when the “FREDDAYYYYEHEYEYEHYEHEYEY” chase starts
Mark repeatedly klicking the button to call for Freddy, which probably reset his path-finding every single time and caused Freddy to take forever to get to Mark, while Mark screams the whole time. Classic Mark.
FREDDYYYYYY
Sometimes I wonder if Mark is really smart or just plain stupid but lucky
“Not now Gregory, I have to find Gregory.”
What time does this place open? Could you imagine being the opening shift people after any of the endings
At the Vanny ending, I can see confusion, a tad bit of sadness, and a hint of laughter
Sun watching as Mark SCREAMS for Freddy and gets shafted like HAHAHAHAHA that's what you get~
wait.. is there another ending? I just realized We never found out what "Mission Plan A" was.  do you have to stay on that stage until 6AM? This makes me want to try this out.
i guess Freddy had enough from the king of FNAF
Freddy: GOOD NEWS! IT IS ALMOST A COK Gregory: *Traumatized for life* You mean a chicken, right?
Mark: FREDDY THERE’S A METALLIC ALLIGATOR CHASING MEH freddy (literally): I don’t care superstar learn self defense (runs) Mark: FREDDY YOU BIEACH
0:30 why did I think it was lagging because mark said fre-fre
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation" Mark, buddy, they probably did it like that so that they could get away with depicting the robots ripping Vanny, a human, to pieces.
9:26 ayo wtf👁️👄👁️
28:39 - 28:52
The chase up and down the stairs cracked me up so much... everything that could go wrong absolutely did xD and Freddy running by made it all the worse!! omg im crying lmfao ok... that enough for today xD
Bro got the comic ending but vannie was a human so it was off screen when it got body parts torn off
Plz tell me bro saved
28:38 mark casually screaming for freddy
White Thomas Johnson Thomas Thomas Jeffrey
" FREeDYYYYYYYY FREEdYYYYY YoU BIOTCHHHHHHH "
26:40 Mark’s game glitched idk why the bot didnt say anything, he took mistook it as empty space that was supposed to lead it to something
28:30 • OMGHEHEHE okay so this bit where he’s screaming at freddy while monty is hunting him down reminded me SO MUCH of a part in his resident evil 2 (remake) playthru where he was yelling at marvin while being hunted down by mr. x !!!!! 😭😭💔💔💔💔💔💔💔 LOLLLLL,,,,,,
Mark yelling "FREDDY" at the top of his had me dying over here laughing, almost woke up the bf in the background xD
The Freddy and Monty saga has got to be one of my fave 'plier moments.. has me in fits everytime I watch it lol
28:42 My favorite part! “FREDDY!!!!”
Markiplier: Freddy now now Freddy NOW!  Freddy: nope bye b$$##@
Did forget about the gun
7:35 WHAT HAPPENED?!
FREDDY RUNNING PAST HIM LMAOOOOOOO
OMG Freddo and Greggory in the "VANNY" ending is just so sad, beautiful and wholesome.
I came back to watch this again, and it still gets me that he got mad at Freddy when he lost Monty 4 times and came either back into view or ran past a staff bot. Bro could have escaped anytime
What're you, serious?
28:39  Him: Freddy Please oh my god no not like this not like this please.  28:42  Him: give me give me a. FREDDY FREDDY YOU [B words] FREDDY!!   Freddy: *Keep running as he didn't see him cuz he blind with his new eyes.*
27:54 to 29:22 yw
27:54 to 29:20 iconic
28:44
Marks hope for the game to be good in the end and have a satisfying ending is so depressing in retrospect...
Imagine being the daytime security team and going into the fazer blast office for your shift and finding your coworker in a fursuit torn limb from limb
Lol
24:44
the start☠️💀
the intro💀
God I was WHEEZING at the insanely high pitch Mark managed to reach while screaming for Freddy
ROCKSTAR ROW TO UTILITY TUNNELS THEN THE LOBBY THERE YOU CAN LEAVE
28:42 Me when my mom gets the belt:
28:44 ties really well with what Mark was just saying about unfinished development lol
How do you get the vanny ending unlocked?
28:40 Freddy you b.i.c.h 😂
28:40 rip markiplier
24:39 oh my god, Mark was right on the money here!!! Scott literally confirmed this!  Scott said that this is exactly what happend in the most recent Dawko interview: All of these loose story bits that Scott came up with and that the development team tried to stitch together with their own story.
why does vanessa sound so lustful when she tells gregory to check the main stage?? it fills me with discomfort
Nobody’s gonna talk about how vanny/ veneser   Got torn apart  And also they should make it so her head get bitten of
27:50  here’s where the chase starts
27:26 - 29:24 lyrics:   Uhh please tell me there's a way that i can get out please ok good good good good good a place for babies ok ah ok interesting huh ok cool where am I going? what am I doing? wooh hey bud don't... get me Ah-it's game over OOH- GOD...how...you Oh, oh my god not monty not monty not monty not monty I can't stop monty I can't stop monty. Freddy freddy please freddy freddy now now freddy now now freddy FREDDIEH! FREDEEH! FREDE I NEED YOU RIGHT NOW! Please be...Oh God oh God that's not freddy FREDDEYEEHHHH! FREEEEEEEDEEEEEEHYE! FRIDAAAY! - Chorus -  NAh OH no no no no FREYEDEEEYH freDEEEEEEEH! Freddy please OH MY GOD NO not like this, not like this  please oh gimme it gimme it FREEDEEEEYEH FREEDAY YOU BITCH FREEDAY FREE DAY  - verse 2 -  Furre- Freddy, don't wait your turn Goddammit, freddy Freddy?

27:57 - 29:21 that one meme 💀
25:00 AINT NO WAY HE GOT IT RIGHT! THE INTERVIEW HAPPENED TODAY AND SCOTT REVEALED THAT IT WASNT SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THIS! HOW DOES MARK KEEP DOING THIS!?
good news, it is almost a c**k!!!
Moon: its past ur bed time Also him *vibin*
29:20 FREDDY YOU BUS TURD!!! XD  Also im the 28000th comment?!
If you watch the video with subtitles in minute 3:53 it says: “Let’s begin by removing daddy’s face” Someone’s gotta be down bad for Freddy 💀😭
There is likely a solid reason it was comic'd instead of a real cutscene...Vanny was human so that would've been too gruesome for people to watch considering how child friendly the caught moments are and what you do to the animatronics; it would likely get a loooot of people on Youtube demonetized. I actually like how it was done, since Freddy's Pizzeria was originally in the 80s that kind of style was quite fitting.
27:50 Markiplier comically runs from Monty while Glamrock Freddy runs right past him
23:58 i thothe you say" golf is for nerds, "
Freddy casually walking past mark😭😭
The "NOPE. They patched THAT," always sends me. I feel that frustration in my bones.
I think the outro was supposed to be a Darkiplier moment...
15:29 Mark short circuited more than Freddy during this scene 😭
Freddy:I can’t let you get in my stomach cause Monty is here Markplier:FREDDY Monty:hahaha Freddy can’t help you
Freddy: Gregory I give you 2 options you can stay or leave Gregory: Vanny Freddy: Gregory, what the fu-
27:56 (Ignore this(
Freddy literally betrayed Mark
17:50, teh first time I watched this I cried 💀meanwhile mark not caring and wondering about the budget lmao
I don’t enjoy your suffering Mark I’m not some kind of sadist I just like seeing if you can handle it
The party past you get me into the watchmahoosit
7:34 WHAT HAPPENED
28:01 Funniest Part In The Whole Security Breach Series Begins 😆
fascinating. 27:20
27:43 Ok cool
Y'know, all the newspaper text just repeats "blah blah blah this has nothing do do with anything relevant to the game." Didn't Scott actually write thinkg in the newspapers in the older games? At least in one of them, I remember something about Scott writing coherent text but blurring it so that you focused on the help wanted ad or whatever. They really couldn't have had an intern write about the game development or just a bunch of stream of continousness stuff on there? It would have been pretty funny
18:04  mark holding back tears when Freddy died
Markiplier doesn’t know that when Vanessa tells u to go to the main stage for the reward u have to press the button then u get a cool ending
I love how Mark remembers meaningless stuff like the exact time of a company meeting but he can't remember main things that he has to do 😂
Just rewatching, and it's always funny to hear Mark yelling my name. 😂 Vanessa!!!
There is no true ending in the game that I am aware of.
“FREEEEDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!” -Markiplier, 2021
*screaming* GO THROUGH THE MAIN STAGE
18:10 😂yes they ran out of budget
28:50 dont
28:40
28:00 where the meme started
27:50 i jumped with markiplier

Wtf
You got the bad ending
those who were looking for this its here : 27:49
*moom jumpscares mark inside freddy* Mark: WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED
“Freddy Freddy please Freddy Freddy now now Freddy now Freddy, Freddy. Freddy, Freddy I need you right now— Freddy!! FREDDAAYYY!!” Freddy: runs by him a million times
He was flabbergasted 😂
IT'S 5:55 IN RL AND IN THE GAME!
28:02 foi aqui que surgiu o meme, certo?
*grass skirt chase* 28:15
3:52 Put the captions on and read what the narrator says. Thank me later.
28:56 tbh he could‘ve just enter the pink door and hide there until monty leaves but he decided to just stay there and let himself get caught 😭 makes the whole moment even funnier tho
Just noticed in the vanny ending Freddy has Monty’s claws… hmm perhaps orginally you were supposed to get monty chica and Roxy before the decision to stay or leave
The tears were completely involuntary when Freddy said you are my superstar
Exit: *right in front of him* Mark: HELP ME
15:08 Freddy has Monty's claws 16:01 Mark: Maybe this is because Freddy didn't have all the upgrades. The game: Welllllll... about that... he did... we just skipped time :D Mark: keeps rambling about Freddy not having all the upgrades. The game: Chicas voicebox, roxy's eyes, MONTYS CLAWS>>> ALLLLL UPGRADES 100% OFF
5:07 freddy is literraly dumb
I died at the end with the Monty chase. Freddy runs by like I forgot something important. While small child yells for him (Markiplyer). I just got into your videos. I love them
In the cutscene of "Vanny', Freddy has Monty's claws already... but when he choses to stay, he doesn't and he never got upgraded bc Markiplier said he still has to get them
I love the part where they make it a comic book cus it actually looks like they ran out of budget.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Everyone being sad on the vanny ending Mark: *deflates*
mark "no no no not monty not monty  cant stop monty" freddy "vacation time"
28:02-29:23 Freddy goes to every spot you call him to before he reaches your current location 🤣
28:26  Markiplier:Freddyyyyy Freddy: Bye
Mark was screaming so loud it sounded like a girls scream 🤣👍

when freddy gets disasimbled he sounds like sun transforming into moon with that scream
😶‍🌫️
Venny is actually Vanessa and she was just killed but in the real ending she is seen in the fire alive
sounds way too sexual that what it means
bro when you get chased by monty and yell for freddy.
*mark being chased by any animatronics ever while spamming Q and running for his life mean while freddy* Freddy: what's that noise? Oh well.  (This is not part of the videos but this is literally how feddy is in my opinion XD)
9:26 Vanessa leading Gregory into (Type in what is next in the reply)
7:36 Mark losing all knowledge on earth and repeatedly going insane
27:49
*gregory… stop beatboxing… im dying*
Good  morning it is almost a clock
11:35 the hell of 'are you serious?' begins
FREDDY YOU BEACH will go down in history
Bro Freddy changed sides
Monty :Hey little guy!  Mark:FRADDYYYY,!!! FREDDDIEIEUUEIEIEI
At the start WHY DIDNT U GO THROUGH THE UTILITY TUNNELS
16:08 i think you cant do anything about freddy dying he just dies no matter what in the cutscene he has all the upgrades so he will die no matter what
28:46 the real of a true friend 😂😂 FREEDY SAID SEE YA U GOT THAT RIGHT 😂
15:32 ...I'm sorry, but isn't that Sun/Moon's tortured scream?????
There's a mean One Freddy was waiting as turn and being a little nutshell when Monty was chasing him
Hey i gotta to say watch the funny video FNAFSB/SFM freddy betrays gregory when the gregory get chased by monty it's your voice markiplier.
27:55 I saw a separate video on markiplier needing Freddy while being chased by Monty
28:44 You dont know how many times I've repeated this part, Fucking dead💀💀💀💀😭😭😭😆😆😆😆
15:27 "THEY JUMPING ME! THEY JUMPING MEEE!! SAVE YO BOY!"
7:40
I'm losing my shit over mark yelling for freddy. 🤣
28:40
x
28:44, I laughed so hard I turned into Muttley the dog.
WHY WAS FREDDY RUNNING PAST SO ON BRAND FOR MARKIPLIER 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀   Edit: GREGORY, DO YOU WANT TO VANNY
28:42 top 10 anime betrayals
Darkiplier just came out at the end lol.
Freddy's screams made me cry bro.... oml....
roses are red violets are blue i will not give a  comment to you
I think when u called him at a certain spot it glitched and made Freddy go to that spot, so when u spammed it, it had to have Freddy go to that spot before being to accept any requests (requests including asking Freddy to come)
Please come find me hahahaha
There's so many more endings that you missed. SPOILER ALERT:   One of the endings is a fire ending
13:41 OH MY GOD FREDDY IS WILL GRAHAM COMFIRMED
Freddy was like ''not right now''😂
Freddy rejected mark😂
"I can _feel_ your anger. It gives you focus, makes you strong."
18:10 This whole game is low budget😂
Did anyone else hear like scratching sounds in their left ear around 19:00? Got half distracted from Mark's rant
jumpscares:1st jumpscare:Moon: 3:34 2nd jumpscare:Moon: 7:30 3rd jumpscare:Moon: 10:45 4th jumpscare:Moon: 12:23 5th jumpscare: S.T.A.F.F. Bots kill Freddy. 15:29 6th jumpscare: Security Bot: 27:53 7th jumpscare: Security Bot: 28:27 8th jumpscare: Monty: 29:14

Monty golf is for nerds
*i think moon man got me bc i can’t stay up my b e d t i m e*
FREDDY FREDDY PLEASE PLEAS FREDDY NOW NOW FREDDY NWO
FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Marks face glitching in sync with the music killed me 🤣 9:48
27:53
I took it offensive when he said that Freddy was sucking power (Power from Chainsaw Man)….
Freddy: "I'll save you Greg!" Sees Monty chasing Greg  Freddy: "I think I left my oven on"
14:01 "if I leave now, nothing will change, will it? There will be more disappearances."  The fuck you talking about? No one has disappeared.
27:49 Markiplier screaming for Freddy
mark: I will show a little of it cuz  for some reason you Guys enjoy my suffering Me : yes yes I do
I love when he screams at freddy lol
*Freddy proceeds to run right past Mark when needed most*  Mark: FrEdDy! FREDDYYYYYYY!!!!!
Freddy!!! 🤣
Mark: FREDDY PLEASE HELP FREDDY freddy: No
Vanny looks pretty hot, ngl
27:55 Mark raging at freddy for being dumb
0:07 💀
9:25 that sounds SO WRONG LIKE WHAT WHERE THEY THINKING LMAOO
Did he forget that the stage lift leads to the main atrium where there are elevators that lead to the main entrance for a while? Or was he ignoring that?
Was this game made by people that never touched a video game ? Fucking autosave is the most basic think in a video game
HAHAHAHAHAJA FREDDY YOU B!TCH FREDDYYYYYY 28:39
Moon saying knock knock implies that he’s the only animatronic that knows Gregory is inside Freddy which when you think about it is a little eerie…
Okay. So. It was extremely obvious thatVanny would be Vannessa, so obvious it seemed like it wouldnt be the case, i mean, they mustve really run out of ideas to make something ad unsuprising as that, right??? No. In the Fire Escape ending, Freddy saceifieced himself to take down Vanny. And then Gregory went up to an unconsciense Vanny and unmasked her. Turns out, it WAS Vannessa. So stupid its so, so stupid
16:22 marking my place.
Plan A is get to a recharge station
rough ending for vanny
As someone who has been subscribed since at least 2015, Mark screaming for Freddy while Freddy runs right past him is almost definitely one of the Top Five Best Mark moments ever.
dang this game flopped so hard cuz it was rushed to be pushed out 🙄 let the devs do what they need to do  anyway maybe some day well have a real freddys pizzaria IRL in some major cities. would be cool !
I went back to the end to count all the times he yelled Freddy! as he was running from Monty, and he yelled it 26 times!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Then twice more to berate him after he died!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Then I went back again to see his longest streak of just yelling Freddy! continuously!!😂😂😂 And he got two streaks of four!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 28:07-28:13 and 28:17-28:26🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Freddy: You wanna stay or leave? Gregory: I wanna Vanny
the end made cry it sooooo emoanle
21:33
i always find it so funny how fazbear entertainment doesnt try to cover up the deaths and stuff by being a good company, but instead it goes all out and is the absolute worst company ever. terrible everything.
Freddy if you don't fight back
Please
Monty: funny after mark Mark: FREDDY FREDDDY FREDDY Monty: caches mark Mark: FREDDY YOU BASTERD
It was a joke .  I hope you can take a joke .  I had to learn how to be a joke .  I’m really tired but it’s so funny I laugh all day !   I hope you enjoy my jokes . Fun right?
Every time Freddy calls Gregory “superstar”: 😊 Last time he called him “superstar” in the Vanny ending:  F THIS IM OUT
Hurt sometimes bringin it down sometime
Mark saying are you serious was seriously giving me a seizure 💀
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣mark is trying to call freddy and i like that part then freddy past mark and mark screaming to freddy it was so so funny i dint stop laughing🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😂
Freddy has really broken Mark. Uh, I don't think it's normal for him to threaten us.
I feel like the main stage should have one of the endings but they simply posted the game without this ending. Because the whole Vanessa dialogue doesn't make sense for me...
Thar are 5 different ending
After he did the eyes for the first time in this video ( 00:05 )  You can see Mark moving the mouse around impatiently
obviously i dont know how the ai works, but to me it has always seemed like freddy runs to where you are when you press the button, any subsequent presses afterwards doesn't do anything, once he arrives you can now give a new order..... aka spamming doesn't do shit and summoning him when being chased means he'll always be too far away, unless you loop around something. at least, that's what it has looked like
Me: on the verge of tears bc Freddy died Mark:
did they run out of budget got me
man, the comedy stylings of staff bot are incredible
What a good intro 👍
It was Funny when he called Freddy,I have also seen the meme of the “funny seance”
After coming back to rewatch the entire fnaf playlist after film came out i now remember how much mark's playthrough of security breach frustrated me😅 the escape the pizzaplex sequence tells you that the recharge stations don't work and your only objective is to escape and mark just continuously ignores the game's instructions😂 like you are given obectives in a certain order paired with dialogue to get you where you need to be and mark constantly assumes it’s trying to trick him or misguide him. to be fair it is fnaf so what can you expect. either way mark's fnaf sb videos are still hilariously entertaining and fun
29:00 Freddy did Mark dirty😭
People who got Siri at 11:52
19:32 Now if that isn't FNAF in a nutshell
This part is so freaking hilarious 🤣🤣🤣  27:56
27:55 the iconic starts😂😂
Notes to self: 27:55 Yes, it's that part.
28:18 Sundrop: Isn't that the kid I banned? Mark: *FREDDY!* Sundrop: Da fuq?
So superstar do you wanna stay or leave?Vanny! Gregory,what tf did you say
So there is an exit to the front door…
15:30 The fact that I can handle the springlock failure, but not Freddy getting disassembled (what I don’t even see directly) is not okay💀
3:32 how moon just went crawling or something towards him 😭😂
9:26 I don’t like that. Why did she say it like that. Why did she say it like that. Why did sh
18:08 As Shinji's English VA once said after the final episode, "I bet you ran out of ink too, ya bastards."
Why he laugh when freddy dies
I like how as I'm re-watching this I noticed his shirt and hoodie are similar to mike's :)
22:34 fnaf help wanted baby plush
Mark at 23:41 "That's the secret. Those things." Me: "Close, but not yet."
Mark destroys the sound barrier
Spoiler for this viid     When Freddie died, I BAWLED. I blame YOU MARK
I didn't had high expectations of the game when i started the series but... damn, it is BAD bad
just sayin mark, freddy goes to the point you call him at not you.
mark saying that the wet floor signs were the secret all along and then the RUIN dlc came out.... i swear scott listens to him
the Freddy betrays Mark scene lives rent free in my head now 🤣
At the end they were disassembling and reassembling freddy 😭💀
3:13 “Foxy plush great, now let me get in you I can’t see a goddamn thing”💀
25:09 mark in his theorizing era fr
vanny is William a.
Dont call him an as*hole he was stuck edit: yes we love ur suffering
You are you sound like your died
I'm really confused on the whole "People will keep disappearing if I leave" line. Did I miss something on when this was an established issue?
27:40
Are u serious? Are u serious? Are u serious? Are u serious-markiplier
i am pretty sure that markiplier press the button to call monty
There was a big boiler room and a lot of maintaintance tunnels in the underground but it was be removed ... so yes, there was a lot diffrent originally
NOT ME CRYING RN BC THE ENDING-
"i know you for some reason enjoy my suffering"  yes Mark ,as much as it pains me to stay it ,I actually do enjoy  it alot
10:30 this, my friends, is moon dancing
Mark: I will find you Me: Sweeeeet I’d love to meet you 😊
FREDDY YOU BASTARDDDD
Same
I just love to image what Sun's view of Mark running around being chased by Monty, while screaming at Freddy.
im totally guilty of laughing when freddy dies the first time bc of marks reaction
28:20 FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYY (for myself)
No way mark is this dumb, I’ve never watched him before, but they literally tell that the charging station are down does he not listen 😂 or what
Freddy: Stay here, together we'll find out what's going on. Also Freddy: I'm tired of this litle shit, goodbye.
Like glitch trap burn trap he’s located in the sinkhole an I seen a video of fighting him it was great
9:28 Vanessa sounded flirty there
3:33 this is the scariest thing in SB
Young Markapiller: My teacher said I could never get scared since I'm not scared of da4k Mommy! Markapiller rn: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAA
28:00 That's why I think glamrock Freddy is useless
30:10 *Me not clicking the link so Mark comes to get me*
Freddy died just gave me a tear
Mark screaming for freddy as Monty try to kill him 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mark really doesn't pay attention to instructions. Game literally tells you the recharge stations are offline and assumes they still work.
Who else thinks that some of moon man’s lines sound like Marge Simpson
17:48 I started to cry😭😭😭
27:48
28:13 this whole part was hilarious😭
Sadly, SB is by far the worst FNaF game for me. The story is a mess. There aren't any big twists aside from the DLC, which doesn't really count for me since you shouldn't need a DLC to make your og game interesting.  But even ignoring the plot and the bugs, the whole mechanic is just really boring for me. It's so much pointless running around and everything just kinda looks the same. It really bothered me that you could outrun the animatronics and later on stun them to make it even easier. To me, whole charm of FNaF has always been it's simplicity. You're stuck in a room and can't flee. You have to manage your resources or it's game over. That was what made it interesting. Just being able to run takes all of this away.
i just got an ad for security breach while watching this
3:59 me every time I see a single save station like this one 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
The distraction in the theater shows that there was probably a sequence there
Feeddy is soooo 🥵 (no homo)

The ending was the funniest sh!t I've seen in a long time. I really needed that laugh.
28:38 this is the funniest scene in this whole series😂😂😂
The pacing on these endings was so laughably awful I thought I pressed a button on my keyboard and skipped ahead a few minutes. Why did they think that was okay to ship?
3:25 Mark dead 1x 😂 Mark: Ho Whoa!!!! wha-.... Uhhh... Do i?... Wha- Whata! Whooa whooaa!!! 》4:00 Mark: Huoh My God...》4:17 Mark: Uh Hah!! Uuh Hah!! 5:00 Mark: Freddy where are you?! Freddy!!

Freddy!!! freddy!!! OMG!!! Fredday!! Freddy! you bastard! 😂XD  mark dead 5x 29:10
i want to like this game and i see the amazing potencial it has...but some of these parts reek of unfinished
Plan A??????
What the up is something is -Markiplier 2021
MY FAV PART😂 27:57 (The chase)
28:42 the iconic moment, the meme 💀
The credits for comic ending start at 18:03 And end at  30:40
Now Chica can't taunt  the Orphan kids about having no family  Now Roxy can't make fun of me with her eyes  Now Monty can't punch me with his claws  But Freddy, can do all those things..............................................................................................................................................................   👁👄👁                                                              Am i to die?
I honestly think a collab between Markiplier and AstralSpiff would be so entertaining
You're just making freddy peak monster material now
multiple endings
Ok I'm late to ask this but to this day can anyone tell me bout that mission Plan A plz
Mark : FREDDY I NEED YOU   Freddy: *runs past him 🏃‍♂️💨 Mark: fREDDYYYYY
Why is this game pretty shit 🥲
I was so ready for SB to have crazy lore and scariness, which it totally did, but I wasn’t prepared for the demolition of my heart and soul in the process.
Freddy is so hilarious omfg😭
who knew Mark could scream at that octave range
Naw vanny killd fereddy 😭
i want my ringtone to be "FREDDAYY?! FREDDAY YOU BITCH! FREDDAYYY! FREEDDAAAAYYYYY!!"
28:44 FREDDY YOU-
Buddy literally said what happened 5000 times 😂😂😂😂😂
Mark, I'm gonna go out on a limb and say they're serious right now.
You did a YTP there 0:06
You did a YTP on there 6:00
7:30 I love how he seemingly dies for no reason and continuously says "WHAT HAPPENED?"
Jumpscares  Moon Drop 3:33 Moon Drop 7:29 Moon Drop 10:45 Moon Drop 12:23 Security Bot 27:53 Security Bot 28:27 Montgomery Gator 29:14    Total this episode: 7  Total this game: 78  Total this series: 530
Mark the endings are all in comics
tip for everyone: after the oculur upgrade, take stage lift back up to the stage/atrium. from here, take the elevator from the atrium to the lobby. idk why mark over complicated it for himself lmao 😭😭  edit: its bc he thought the lift went back up lol. but yeah just take the lift then the elevator
10:06 We were all thinking that lmao
FREDDYYYYYYYYY
When moon came out it said to escape the recharge stations are offline that is why you couldn't get in
Uhh… why do the “wet floor” signs have eyes? And why do they just stare aimlessly? What’s the point of those things anyways? Creepy little shits…
28:42 😂😂😂
0:03 That intro caught me off guard, well done Mark.
Bro said: 'Im gonna go for a walk and buy some milk' and took a WHOLE tour around the facility.😂😂😂
legends say Freddy is still trying to find gregory
"FREDDY YOU B**CH" I was dying. Both by laughter and being scared.     Also see you at my house mark!
" GOOD NEWS! IT IS ALMOST A 🐓" 😂😂
is it just my computer or does the quality of the video drop right at the end(wich is the funny part)
“Did they run out of budget”
“Bro when is the part where Freddy runs from mar- HOLY SHIT ITS HAPPENING”
And so THE Animation was born 😂 27:52
I can imagine Amy hearing “FREDDY YOU BITCH! FREDDYYYYYYY!!!” and being utterly concerned 🤣🤣🤣
And this end become the one of the most iconic moment of all fnaf games
bro died so many times he knows when each of the upgrade combinations happen and he just knows what to do
27:45 the original meme: „freddy freddy now now now…“ it’s to nice 😂
At the end when gregory was checking up on freddy after vanny died I got a notification saying “This is disappointing” 😂😂😂 It perfectly fit this scene coincidentally😂
oh my god so much pain in this one. i want to like this game but so much about it seems just not fun. who thinks it's fun to turn off save stations at key moments in the game, directly before dangerous challenges? why does a game need a save station in the first place in current year? even when mark edits out the long sequences of replaying the same shit i feel the pain. the game would be so much better if it just had checkpoints like a normal game, and maybe a few less security bots.
Marks reaction to Vanny ending is the same one I have for almost everything in this game, I mean what “disappearances?” A little context for the game would be nice
I wonder if some point in the game Freddy finds out what Greg actually did to his friends and see how their friendship and trust will play out...which won't be too good.
Freddy and Puss in Boots sound so much alike in voices 🤔
5:13 foreshadowing 😅
𝕃𝕠𝕝𝕝
love the content man but you talk way to much like its ungldy how much your repeat your self. its like watching an anime from the 80-90s with all the fillers and recap...you only get 10 mins of actual new show
The name at the very last credit sadly he died because of suicide😢:mike Hoffman
0:00 Bro wuddafuk 3:30 SPAWNKILLING?! 7:30 I enjoy your suffering to empathize with you, Mark. <3 Can't have the good without the bad.  9:00 Wutda... are we gonna see Vanny with a dead Monty nearby, begging for an ultimate fight like Vegeta?  10:45 What??  13:15 This is so sad... 14:15 IF GREGORY IS CAUGHT, IT IS GAME OVER?! BUT THAT... oh gosh.. NIGHTMARE MODE?!  14:45 FREDDY, NO?!  17:00 ?!?? I cried slightly. The way he always called Gregory "Superstar" is actually touching here.  19:45 End message for Vanny ending.  23:15 Auahahauuauahauu 26:00 Comedy stylings of S.T.A.F.F. bot 28:20 LMAOO  30:00 geez.. someone give him milk!!  NOT THAT ENDING :sob:
5:02 the animatronics do get a bit quirky at night
11:57 Mark having a mental breakdown cause he completely forgot  that the game literally said the charging stations were turned off and he wouldn’t be able to hide in them anymore is making me cry laughing.
This video has been the best one yet 😊
Mark: FREDDY!!!! FREDDY YOU BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!! His Neighbours: Ah, dammit hun, he's at it again!! Mark: Freddy you bastard!!!
Mark: "FREDDY! FREDDY YOU BITC*! FREDDY!"
Dear god, this game is a bug fest. But the last part with Freddy run past Mark was very funny.
I love how Mark literally called it when he said the wet floor sign bots were the secret all along…
Freddy: “Do you want to stay or do you want to leave?” Gregory: “I WANNA VANNY!”
Ugh i really wish they had spent more time on this game. It would have generated so much more hype for the franchise if they delivered a genuinely polished product, and not yet another rushed and buggy mess
This game is hard to beat.....
18:00 Kung Fu Panda
FREEEEEEEEDYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!
How can Freddy betray you😢
I think no saves by staying is an insane choice to have made. Personally I would have kept that to just the Vanny ending - or if the devs really wanted to make the game more difficult, then only certain autosaves for every option.  Edit: Now imagine if this game had multiplayer. Imagine if Mark was playing this, somehow, with Bob and Wade. I am not talking, of course, about Bob and Wade being able to distract Monty and lure him away; I’m talking about them both laughing hysterically at Mark’s misery.
Dude the change in styles for the Vanny ending was literally so jarring that it made such a gross feeling in my stomach 😂
im going to feed freedy gold fish
Just hearing him yell *FREEDDDYYYYYYYY!!!!!* HAD ME IN TEARS BYE ✋🏾😩🤣🤣🤣
Mark at the end FREDDDDDDDDDDDDY!!
They really shouldve gone more of the sister location route: make it less open world and more level-like where different areas have different mechanics to their games. Lets the animatronics be more designed for their roles and less of a general mechanic that has to apply to different games
18:09 Yes, Mark.  Yes they did.
staff bot at 27:53 scared THE SHIT out of me LMFAO
This is probably the best episode of this entire playlist. Absolute gold 🥇
R.I.P FREDDY (WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN
I love how it opens at 6pm and its the fuck large
he walked past a disk that can be used for vanny secrets…. AND watching Freddy run past mark multiple times was peak comedy
9:24 I think she tried to sound creepy but well she still does in a sense so yeah
You have to press the button in the  main stage.
Mark screaming "FREDDDYYYYY!!!" at such a high pitch while running from Monty made me laugh so much lmao. And the fact he still remembers this moment in Ruin is gold.
I know your not going to read this but here is the start lore for SB I quote “Fnaf security breach was supposed to be the scariest out of all the other 6 but due to the about of complaints from the mothers “that is to ‘scary’ for our kids” when in reality they shouldn’t have started playing in the first place” I know your not going to read this but if you do that’s the explanation
28:20
Okay, I never grew up alongside Five Nights At Freddy's. I knew of its existence, but didn't know much about it. I just studied the lore over a weekend to catch up because I was curious why everyone loved it so much. I can see why Security Breach doesn't have quite the same charm, but the voice acting is great, there are captions, and darn if I'm not a sucker for the found family trope
Ok I don't care about low quality or budget or whatever that was actually heart wrenching. Also Gregory's face WATCHING A HUMAN BEING getting torn apart
freddy is going to littlery turn evil fyi
17:57 to 18:06: *mark wheezes uncontrollably*
16:54
i have a theory vannese afton
27:56
I was crying when Fred said you are my super star.... the there’s mark WHo is laughing.
Other youtubers with the VANNY ending: "FrEddY nOOoo!!" *emotional noises*  Markiplier: *wheezing noises* "wtf just happened-"
Bro, the squished dog laugh
Normal Freddy:”Good news! It’s almost 6 clock!” Freddy edited by markipleir:”Good news!it’s almost a 🐔) Also is nobody going to mention how Gregory had the robots KILL Vanny?!
*Freddy:* Do not come back, it'll never be safe here. *Also Freddy:* You are staying? I am glad! PIck a side, Fredboy
28:06 Clearly Freddy is refusing to help Markiplier because he Knew what Markiplier did to chica and roxy
The”Did they run out of budget”💀
28:29 😂😂😂
Was there actually supposed to be something on the main stage or did Vanessa just trick the player
"...I will find you..."  Mark, don't threaten me with a good time LOL
That's so sad that I was about to cry on my bed pour Freddy
Moon man is goin like a pat pat here and a pat pat here
Haha I didn't click on them haha you got killed by Monty and I didn't haha!
Freddy running in the complete opposite of Mark will never get old to me
27:56 the start of it all. "FREDDYYYY!!"
Its not budget its just cuz you got the bad ending
Freddy running past Mark when he needed him the most was hilarious!
07:05 he found a secret disc but didn’t collect it
28:03=I said "Oh no it's  strating😂" *Freddy goes past him 'dies of laughing'
i love how mark has just slowly lost his mind throughout this whole series ☠☠☠☠☠
Oh man I'm sooo glad I looped back around to watch this. Marks hopelessly yelling or Freddy's goofy as to come save him is pure Gold. 😂
Me after looking at the thumbnail: where's the goddamn lotion
is it just me or is the only animatronic thats actually scary is Monty
Bro when Freddy died my mom looked at me and asked “why are you crying?”
27:30
28:22 - 28:46 when you see when the actual thing is better than the clip
24:40 - 26:14 exactly people that don't dive deep into what makes a buggy game a buggy game like what happened to it or why is this way or why is it the way that it is right now it's like a swimming pool at the bottom of the water there is The lore of the game is what it is and then you have yourself at the top of the diving board but you afraid to jump into that "water" but sometimes you have to pull up your big boy pants and be brave like for example look at Sonic 06 (like imagine a world where people didn't "dive deep into that metaphorical water" people would be running around like chickens that got their heads cut off trying to find answers but getting none because they didn't dive deep) and that was my tedtalk   See when you get those answers it's refreshing am I right?
12:47 "you tried to trick me" I think that was the point (maybe)
12:13 I didn't know you could recharge your flashlight in Freddy (now the question is that intentional or is that for everyone or is that a glitch)
10:46 there it is
Freddy patiently waiting for Monty to move out of the way.... 10/10
0:02 - 0:05 sounds like an fnf mod
Out of all the jumpscares this game throws at you that 7:30 mark one is the only time watching mark playing got me to jump in fear with him lol.
Freddy! You bastaaaaaaaaaaard! 😂😂😂
25:43 I mean, when the game was nearly done, Scott dipped because some mfers doxxed him and his pregnant wife just because of what he was donating money from his games' sales to. He said the games would be handed over to a different developer, who are probably the ones that finished security breach. So that’s probably why the game is a bit different…and buggy as hell.
I love this man sm
Mark forgetting he can’t get in the recharge lol
Mark: FREDDYYYYY!!!! Freddy: NOT NOW, GREGORY! I HAVE TO SAVE GREGORY!
I'm the disassemble freddy cutscene, freddy has monty's claws already, lol
Freddy, you b### had me cracking up😂😂😂
22:34 marks worst nightmare. (If you watched help wanted)
Does Mark know that the Princess Quest ending is the true ending?
5:05 XD 7:23 XXD 9:20 Mark's visual confusion XD 10:32 Plan A 17:57 Mark wheezing 23:21 28:30 XD!!
That intro was absolutely gold
This is so funny
" Good news! It is almost a coc- "
*sad scene happening* Markiplier : did they run out of budget for the last animation 😅
Me: actually thinks the ending is sad.  Mark: did they run out of budget for the last animation 😂😂😂😂
7:30 ??
The Wafflehouse Has Found It's New Host
23:55
i was kinda crying on the vanny comic part then the "they went out of budget for the last animation" hit me
You can really feel Mark's rage come to life in that outro gif. x'D
The epic betrayal,
FEDDDAAaAAaAaaaayy
Now the bot on stage tells jokes and then there's a magician bot that shows up after. Not a joke.
28:54 *freddy don’t wait your turn god Damit*
10:42 bit
Freddy betraying gregory (AKA Mark) is pure serotonin
28:33 FREDDY FREDDY YOU BITCH FREDDY😂😂
I’m just gonna pinpoint 28:00 for future happiness
28:41 got me a laughing 😂
28:14 this part is the most iconic… FREDDYYYYYY😭🤣
28:02 meme
0:05  pov: freddy gives you bottom surgery, ftm
I wanted to be the newest
Hi
This defines SB; anger. Not fear. Just pure, raw, unrefined, Super Saiyan inducing fury.
28:15 ignore me just want to save it so i can rewatch it everytimr
17:42 so this is prototype freddy looking if u remove the head
freddys more of a father than a friend
mark trying to get into a recharging station after being told the recharging stations are offline and cant help him hide its such a mark thing to do
I wish fnaf never took a calming approach. I wish when steel wool came along they went in a more darker and scary tone of fnaf instead of a softer more adventuristic tone. I mean SB has its ups and downs and still is fun but it wouldve been better to be scared shitless imo. I mean just imagine the scooping room remade but with gore OR vanny's death unncensored. I think FNAF shouldn't hold back for what the lore is.
Bruh went to the mane stage
"FREDDY!!!!!"
i never knew a video game could make me cry.
FREDDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
27:50 comedic chaos at it's best
hopefully you can come find me better than freddy tryna find you cuz wow...even w those new eyes he LEGALLY BLIND
What a downgrade from all the previous fnaf games :(
27:56 .
spoiler warning 00:00 - 29:35
11:35 R U SERIOUS!!😂😂
7:32 what happened?
3:33 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The eyes highlighting things you've already found is annoying
Not now gregory i have to save gregory is exactly what happened at 28:00
Freddy and his friends are all going to the lobby
The same sound effects from fnaf 1 and 2
I'm going to say that's not fair that the moon man can attack you when it's 6am but others can't
Never listen to vanessa
Its so bad that you cant save because it is so much you have to do and if you die you die
"Not now, Gregory. I need to save Gregory"
3:55 “ let’s begin by removing daddy’s face” 😂 love closed captions
mark screaming "FREDDY! FREDDY YOU BITCH!" had the exact same energy as Joel saying "Protogent! You SWINE!" during his windows vista destruction video, but somehow multiplied by 10
28:03
Go to 27:54 for something super funny😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
27:53 wow!!
Did he ever get Monty’s claws ?
For anyone wondering it is 27:53 where the start of the Freddy Screams come in
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 bro died from me
Did anyone see the baby plush from fnaf help wanted at 22:33 minutes

i cannot believe i've noticed mark forget that the charging stations are off for 5:50 TWICE so far  (as of 11:15 into the vid)
looking for the moment when Freddy betrayed Gregory?, here it is 27:53, thank me later :)
Batrayal
Idk if my game was bugged, but I found a save point after choosing the stay ending
"Good news it is almost a 🐓" - freddy 2022
27:52
Mark: Vanessa can't be Vanny, that would be too obvious Vanessa: You outsmarted me, but I outsmarted your outsmarting
A.M., not Video time.
They didn’t patch it, the charging stations turn offline at 5:50
The biggest meme ever from Fnaf is definitely markerplier screaming freddy while being chased by Monty and then Freddy goes right past him
"Good news it is almost a 🐓"  Got me🤣🤣
I think why the ending was in a comic style was because it would’ve been so graphic that they would have to raise the game rating. That or they thought it would be cool for some reason.
28:49 this scene is the whole reason I started watching this
i genuinely cried in freddys death
I’m not clicking the link so come find me
29:19 wait markiplier what does freddy say oh yeah IT IS PART OF MY DESIGN.... so freddy leaving you to die ispart of his design don't blame the user blame the maker
I played though the endings an there's 3 the hardest one is the burntrap/springtrap ending were you fight burntrap basically vanny was a beta tester she tested a game then her body was taken control of by glithctrap which is William afton he force her to find his body from fnaf 6 that's underneath the pizzplex an repair it after that she transfer his mind glirchtrap into his body in burntrap ending you defeat burntrap but you guess it settting him on fire till he weak enough to be captured by the blob the emalgamation of ever anamtronics from fnaf 1 an 2 an 6 an sister location the second an my most favorite is vanny ending you get it you must complete all the princess quest to free her an give her control of her body an my favorite parts is you helping freddy excape in this ending freddy ses he cannot leave but Gregory an vennesa get the idea to use a car battery to continue to charge freddy they then excape to together the crappy ending is the excape ending were vanny dies glamrock freddy dies an the other glamrock anamtronics die while you excape freddy thinks the only way to fully stop burntrap is to burn the pizzaplex to the ground which he does once you excape those are the 3 ending  Excape ending  Vanny ending Burntrap ending  I think there a 4th one but I don't know it
Did Mark add in that buzzing at 23:35 or were the Caution Wet Floor bots making that sound themselves?
My favourite part of this whole series 27:58
You dont know where to find me
Best intro
the beginning goes crazy, the combo of the beeping and then gouging eyes and then "Good News, It's almost a cock" killed me
27:53  the moment you were all waiting for
Who is here from the Ruin DLC? Especially the part at @28:40?
Mark: but i will show you a little bit because i know that you for some reason enjoy my suffering Me: 'cries' you know me so well Mark
28:43
Not Freddy trying to teach Gregory a lesson on how to "wait your turn" like a true father figure😂
I’m just saying I can’t help but laugh it’s too funny freddy running away
Time stamp for me and all the people who want to see mark get harassed by Monty. 27:53
28:35 Freddy’s trying his best
“Are you serious”
0:05 “good news, it is almost a cluck” -freddy fazbear 24/12/2021
21:17  im sorry what
FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
When Freddie runs past mark its like my dad running away when I need him 💀
Vanessa: I have a reward for you~ My gay ass: 😳
I think it's funny how the reward didn't show up cause of the path mark took, if you go through the gate in rockstar row you CAN get it before getting to the door
Mark when Fnaf ruin comes out can you play it?
Freddy just said "sike betch"
28:55 yes i will wait my turn im gentle:]
28:43 sorry:( 28:47
FREDDYYY!!! GET BACK HERE YOU BASTARD! FREDDDDYYYYYYYYYY!!!
14:27 got me lauthing
B
Dont ask 23:34
FREDDY NOW FREDDY PLS FREDDYTY NOW NOW NOW,FREDDDY YOUR A BIT** FREDDYYYYY
Marks pure ignorance makes me so mad
Markiplier screaming for Freddy Freddy running past markiplier = turning mark into meme Markiplier u always make my day but truly whenever I have a bad day I watch the end of this video and suddenly I feel a lot better
“Did they run out of budget while making the last animation?!” No, they ran out of budget while making all the final animations.
The part that freddy dies almost gave me depression 😢
Kellen Goff is the same voice actor for fiddlesticks
I think this is the first time I was ever annoyed at markipliar 😂
Freddy: "You are my superstar..." Mark: *_asthma_*
The Moon #1 3:33  The Moon #2 7:28  The Moon #3 10:45  😅😂😊 yet it's Moondrop... i will get you 🌜
“Did they run out of budget for the last animation” CACKLING LMAOAOAO
Okay but why would you run in and out of the rooms that could potentially hide you when you've broken line of sight??
It's hard to believe that this gane is already a year old. It feels like it was yesterday when Mark was running from Monty and screaming at Freddy.
5:32 Freddy Freddy FREDDY FREDDYY / got me dying
*"FREDDYYYYYYY FREDDY YOU BASTARRRRRRD"*
MARKIPLIER HOW DARE U LAUGH AT FREDDIES DEATH
Aw man our dog died 😢😔
Vanny is albino🥹🐇
he will find you as quickly as he found the washing machine door
I love it when fr
“FREEDDDYYY!!”
10:34 HIS LITTLE GREMLIN CRAWL I CANT-     (i mean moon btw
The game - escape the pizzaplex and get out. mark - 'what do i do..i dont understand..'
5:14 was foreshadowed
I’m sorry Markiplier, but that was hilarious at the end Freddy not coming to you when you needed Freddy the most never going to hear that sentence again😂
Mark not fully understanding that Freddy gets summoned to the location you last pressed the button will never not be funny. All he had to do was press it when freddy was right infront of him and freddy wouldve stopped
7:28 back shot has inflicted by the moonman to gregory which is inside freddy's stomach and that's why you ain't got a jump scare. What Gregory sees is like in 10:45 .
It's fun to think about what it must be like for Amy. She's just doing something quiet and then hears "FREEEDDDDYYYY, YOU BASTARDDDDDD!"
Worst fnaf game ever💀💀
27:57  This is where a Meme is born…
Why... why does Vanessa sound like she's tryna initiate some Rule 34 nonsense when telling Gregory he deserves a reward, and should come to the main stage 🤨
11:40 Freddy said in the last episode, that you couldnt use the recharge stations
17:50 Freddy: Literally dies Mark: This is the funniest thing ever in the game
29:02 28:54 28:02  28:21 28:32 28:45
I love when mark gets pass a wet floor man he says hi it’s just funny
28:48 I feel bad for his neighbors 💀
The amount of things mark forgets
They way he yells “ FREDDY FREDDY fREddY
28:37 XDDDDDDD freddy go sweep!
5:20 i think freddy was to..🤨  🐺 🐻 🛏
how do i get alot of likes in the commens 😅
The fact that even Freddy avoids Mark when he needs him is pure comedy
the daycare music in the background while mark is being chased by monty is killing me 😭
The iconic : NOW NOW FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY YOU BITCH FREDDY DONT WAIT YOUR TURN GOD DAMMIT
is it just me or is mark hot😍😘
23:19 Mark : (gibberish) * to the wet-floor sign * hi.  The sign : *aaAAaa*
I'm laughing at 28:03 it is so funny 😂😂😂😂
𝓔
27:53
3:33 why did Moon move like that LMAO
28:44 “FREDDY GET ME IN GET ME IN! FREDDY WHERE ARE YOU GOING!? FREDDY YOU BITCH FREDDY YOU BITCH!” Freddy running up the stairs
20:55
looking back in hindsight wouldnt the camera be better than the laser? sure the laser has more shots but by going to monty gold you take out monty cause he is locked behind a party pass. then you could do chica and roxy without having to choose the stay option with the horrible no save decision
Well mark they used to have a glitch that you can continue saving but not anymore they now have a single daylight save station in the astium
I finally found the clip when freddie passed mark lmao. He is surely screaming at the top of his lungs.
28:44 he just scream freddy😆😆😆😆😆
The vanny option actually only appears if you find her office/hideout
Freddy neglecting mark while he was running from Monty is the first time in a while where I laughed hard in a gaming video
Freddy dies. Also freddy later with Monty. freddy im going on vacation
How it feels walking past attractive women 23:32
big sexy daddy '
Wheezing is flawless lmao XD
28:45 Fred’s like “Ight bout to head out 🏃
Stay
William accidently become Cyberpunk City Planner
Good news! it is almost a 🐓
28:42 Freddy done said that's what you get for lasering my eyes mark🤣😂
bro went soo high pitched
Hey does anybody know what happens when you're at the main stage at 6? I saw the plan a thing but i have know idea what it means
28:38
Freddyyyyyyyy
I think the Vanny ‘ending’ was originally meant to be a vanny boss fight. It feels as though the audio is incomplete and doesn’t necessarily match up to the animation.
Game: "...recharging stations are offline..."  Mark: "I need to get to a recharge station. That's how you get away from Moon man."  What part of "Offline" doesn't click?😂
It was kinda cute when he just yelled my name while being on the main stage- oop
27:53-29:20 😂😂
"FREDDY! FREDDY YOU BASTARD!" *silent pause* "Uhm. Anyways."
Did y’all not miss the fact that a mission called “planA” at 10:46? I don’t know what it means though
fun fact: He said 'Freddy' 65 times in this video
So, Glamrock Freddy is William's son. There is only 1 animatronic in the aim cast with a soul, and it is Freddy. William's oldest son(I forgot the name), the one who killed his brother in FNAF 4 ending scene, got his soul trapped. The reason behind why Freddy fainted as soon as he saw Gregory was him being exactly identical to his brother that he accidentally killed while being a jerk to him.        Other animatronics attacks because they are controlled by Vanny's system access(perhaps they don't have soul unlike Fedy). Vanessa was one of the testers of Help Wanted. As she says I one of the tapes we find during the game, Vanessa sees hallucinations and hears voices in her head after testing. We can also listen to voice tapes of her going to a psychotherapist and talk8ng about her mental problems with these weird stuff. This was because of Glitchtrap. William managed to enter Vanessa's mind and created a stronger personality named Vanny that can be used by him. Afton was seeking revenge. But the old animatronics were looking for revenge too(so they killed him in the boss fight).        And about the Morty thing. As we see in the game, both Morty and Bonnie were bass players. In a tape found in the game, we see an old style animation of Freddy,Chica, and Bonnie. Animation ends with where we see Bonnie and Morty attack him. That is why there are purple patches on Morty. As Vanessa says to Freddy in the safety chamber that they might throw him away and Morty might replace him. This also supports our theory.    In the end, Freddy is the older brother from FNAF 4, William controls Vanessa, Vanny controls animatronics,and Morty kills Bonnie.        Thank you if you read all of this.
You know Freddy's serious when he doesn't end his sentences with "superstar"
He chose the saddest ending lol
Mark screaming for Freddy Freddy: hmm must of been the wind
Sorry for coming a little early and almost ruining your intro, but anyway I found it absolutely fucking hilarious when you were being chased down by Monty and Freddy decided to have a nice little stroll and pass by you completely ignoring you while you were calling him for help, lmfao
28:40---  *Freddy casually runs right past Mark and towards Monty*   Mark: FREDDYYYYYYY!!! FFFFFRRRRREEEEEEDDDDYYYYYYYYYY!!!!! FREDDYYY FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY YOU LITTLE BITCH FRRRREREEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!! this had me wheezing omg🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 29:20----   FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!!!!!!!!! omg... i cant with him...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
17:55 Just Marks wheeze 🤣
7:28 You ok Mark
5:01 Mark is already done with Freddy 🤣
0:00 The most stupidest start to a Mark video
At 10:49 that jumpscare got me good, I was on the bus and I jumped lol
Did Mark just completely forget about Chica and smashing her and taking her voicebox???? 🤔 🤣
17:53 NOOOOOO💔😭
13:55 legit had me about to cry! Even knowing full well it wasn't actually the end, Freddy saying goodbye got me💔🥺
3:33 mark has chance to use Chicas stun and doesnt.... 🤣
After Mark put Chicas voice box in Freddy, thus far, hasn't even been inside Freddy(PAUSE) and used the Chica function to stun other animitronics 🤔 right?? Given tools he doesn't use. Classic Mark. 🤣🤣
Him: I will find you Me: yeyyy
vanny is a furry
17:57 28:46 29:18
"thank you everyone so much for watching *I'm Done"* Idk why that was so funny to me lol-
13:43 freddy looks so sad because gregory is leaving 😭
28:26
Fun fact there is a save station after you stay. It's in the main floor. By the elevator. Where freddys recharge station is
freddy:we cant go in the recharge stations mark: proceeds to try and get in the recharge station
Thank you mark I have completely the end and I love you mark
No way
FREDDYYYYY🐦🐦🐦
28:54 "Freddy don't wait your turn goddamnit  that moment when the politeness of your friend literally kills you💀
When the screen goes sparkly I go in recharge station
I still love the noises put in for the wet floor sign boyos. Those guys are downright cute
mark be like freddy i need you i need you i need you right now
For me: 16:51
freddy is like OH HELL NAH YOU DEAL WITH HIM
28:01
Freddy: "Your my superstar." *dies*  Mark: *wheezes* 😂😂😂
The pizza plex is bigger than the amount of years I've lived on this planet
yes Mark we were serious
Your screaming like a girl
Not Freddy just running past mark as he calls for him
we all knew that freddy would betray mark sooner or later cause thats just how fnaf is lol but mark could of survived when he was near the bathrooms down stairs cause monty stoped chasing or mark could of gone the the recharge station get freddy lol
28:46 😂😂😂😂😂😂 I died
Moon’s dance tho
Yeah after these parts of FNAF sb how mark screams kinda reminds me the animation I watched and it had marks voice😮🤔I thought that person that made animation toke some of his voice lines to make the animation one voice line is "can I fall of and die I'm not gonna try, ahh and he dies😂
Man this was not well written at all. How on earth does Gregory suddenly reveal he knows about the disappearances????
28:44 gregorys brother be like😂
My friend and I laughed at 27:42 for a whole year and are still laughing about it 🤣
Mark screaming FREDDIEEEE got me so weak 😭
This episode is a masterpiece
If you run fnaf 1 custom night night 7 20/20/20/20 on 2 fps and never open the camera you dont have to do anything and you can beat the game!
Mark just running for his life: “FREDDYYYY” freddy: *runs right past him*
I find it incredibly sad that Freddy died in vanny
Maaaaaaaan we vibing the whole episode and right as I grab my drink the mf staff bot jumpscare made me pour it all over the place😭 why is it scarier than any other ones
18:49 yes 😂😂
OMG LOL! 🤣 I was wondering where the mark shouting at Freddy while monty chases him scence was! Lol!
Mark forgot he can use voicebox to stun moon
The Monty chase is at 27:54
freddy: *dies* mark: BAHAHHAHAHAHA U DUMB PET
“You serious? You serious? You serious? You serio- You serous? You serious? You serious? You serious?”
“Don’t I still have the objective of- no I don’t- yes I do- No I don’t! - YES I DO” 😂😂😂 got me laughing so hard!
from the hundreds of markiplier videos I've watched, Freddy running past Mark has got to be on the top 10 funniest moments
Good news! It is almost a cock!
YOU FORGOT THE INTRO YOU-
FREeeEeeEEddDaaaaaAAYYY!!!!!
So freddy can't see vanny so roxys eyes help him to do the vanny ending meaning if you played princess quest 1 2 and 3 you would be able to do the vanny ending!😊
I love how there are multiple people credited for quality assurance in the game with even a QA director and producer listed.
27:53 thats the first time i jumped so hard when watching him play lmao
28:40 and Freddy just RUNS past him. LOL
I was like- mark..dont pick Vanny don't pick Vanny you picked Vanny I knew I was gonna cry :)
I like your videos however repeating yourself when talking fallowed by screaming ,someone’s name is not fun, and makes me uncomfortable when viewing, you’re videos. Please try not doing this in every video, because it is a bit off putting.
what is going on in this megaplex lol. despite the LOREEEEE circulating about events before the start of this game, it feels so incredibly disconnected from the in-game events compared to the previous games. SB would’ve been amazing if it was given more development time.
While watching this I had to pretend the collectibles weren't put back after death to save my anxiety🤡
Markerplier: FREDDDY!  Freddy: not now Gregory I need to pick up Gregory
Freddy was like “oh hey Monty, there’s this kid who keeps screaming for me and uhhh I need to go get him”
27:57 I can’t 🤣🤣🤣
Anyone know what the main stage thing was?
Am i the only one who saw  bonnie in the movie theater
At 28:43, I literally almost cried of laughter. 💀💀💀
28:43
11:11
27:57 - 29:18
Mark not understanding that Freddy goes to wherever you summoned him not where you currently are 😂😂
Literally this 5:09 and when Mark was running from Monty and Freddy ran past him was utterly hilarious I couldn’t stop laughing for like half an hour🤣🤣🤣
28:34 (Freddy runs past Markiplier when he needed help) Me:😂😂😂😂😂 Poor Gregory, I wonder why Freddy ran past Markiplier?😊😊😊😊😊
It's the mega pizzaplex not a pizzaria
I lose it every time I hear Freddy say “superstar”
Fnaf security breach is so cool. I only need the hide and seek master Archivment, but i almost done with it. Need only the roboter head and Roxy-fight
Freddy dies mark: 😂😂😂
In the end, Freddy was your downfall.
15:29 Freddy: AUGH MY FAZ BALLS
Is it me or does the scream when Freddy gets disassembled sound like syndrop turning into moondrop?
Freddy: "you are... my superstar..." *dies* Me: *literally about to cry cuz its so sad*  Mark: haha no more budget lol
"FREDDÆEE YOU BAS-
Do you want to stay or leave? Mmmmmmmmmm I chose Vanny
game: makes Freddy go exactly where you push the call button Mark: Screaming Freddy's name as if he can here him through the screen
92/111
You never made it to the exit on time the gift at the main stage is a trick where she makes moon catch you.
L you got the sad ending. I'm sorry
27:53 this is where the meme came alive...
FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!
Freddy running past Mark when he needed the most is so hilariously on brand
You know, I'm a woman and even I can't scream in that high a pitch. Very good!
Freddy:"Nothing can hide from me now" Also Freddy: proceeds to *not* see moon around the corner
I was CRYING when he was screaming for Freddy when Monty was chasing him lmfao
GET A VANNY BODY PILLOW
As someone who's name is actually Vanessa this was very entertaining to watch Mark angrily scream my name 😆😆
"OH GOD, NOT LIKE THIS.  FREDDY! FREDDY, FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!!" 😂😂😂 Thanks For Brightening Up My Day Markiplier. 🤘
8:30 lol for me the elevator was not down anymore and no option damn
Freddy running past him and Monty was pretty Golden 😂
Good news it is almost a c$$k
"I'm sorry Gregory, I can't seem to stop getting jiggy with it."
28:44 put me into literal tears
28:00 FREDDY YOU BITC—
Fazbear theatre is a perfect example Of what Mark was saying  There are tons of unused lines of staffbot telling jokes that they never got to implement   I feel like they cut 3/4 of the story out of the game cause they ran out of time even after numerous delays   It’s far bigger than any project Scott or Steel Wooo ever developed and they went from the still relatively simple Help Wanted head first into this one without the proper experience
Mark: “Fazbear theater..”  OH IT’S TIME FOR THE CLASSIC SCENE
I feel like they rewrote this game’s story like 10 times and scraps from each version of the story are still in the game so nothing makes any sense in context to each other
Freddyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Ok
Do yell know ruin
Are u zereus he he
Mark screaming for Freddy whilst running from Monty is arguably the best part of this series 😂
3:30 skill issue
Only Vanessa who scams Gregory all the time
Freddy allowing you to leave is the biggest twist I could witness in FNAF's history.
28:16 The way he screams gets me every time!
I have no idea why Moon can get you through Freddy. Does he just yank Freddy’s stomach hatch open and grab Gregory or what
Everyone talking about the whole Monty chase with Freddy ignoring him part ( which is HILARIOUS ), but I’m mostly losing it over 29:58 - 30:05 😭
Bro is her mum or somin okay in the background 💀
while freddy running past mark is iconic, the best part of all this was the staffbot comedy moment. i think it truly summarises the sheer incompetence of this game while also being genuinely hilarious.
30:35 got me
28:38
6:17 sorry mark😂
Freddie Dying at the vanessa ending: after that: time skip to monty chasing him Mark: FREDDDDDDIE FREEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE FREDDIE YOU BASTARD
It’s 5:55 AM where I am right now
LOL Freddy running past mark when he needed him most made me laugh so hard I couldn't breath for like 25 seconds
Me:the end of VANNY is so SAD😭😭 Mark:🤣🤣🤣
HE MISSED PEW PA😪
I’m still so confused about the “ending”
18:08 "Did they run out of budget for the last animation?" I cant 😭
28:43 best moment in the entire game
27:55 to 29:15 was the best moments of my life
I never knew that the Freddy from the previous FNAFs who was the star of the show, the name of the brand and the horrifying killer bear would be the same Freddy I'd be balling my eyes at when he puts his hand on Gregory's head and says he'll miss him, and also the same Freddy that sacrifices himself to save Gregory even if he still dies at the end and calls him his superstar.
0:06 gets me every time 😂😂
freddy: dies markiplier: laughes
Monty chasing Mark 27:58 - 29:15 Hope this helps ^^
'gregory, do you wish to stay or to leave?' 'VANNY'
*Freddy diez* Markiplier: *wheezes*
28:39 “It's been a long day without you, my friend And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again”
I like how Freddy was like ‘not now Mark I gotta help Mark’
i love how mark completely forgets that at the end of the last episode it told him the recharging stations were offline & he STILL tries to use them 💀
"Freddy don't wait your turn goddamnit!"
btw mark there are 6 endings in this game good luck with out a walk through
FREDDY!!!! FREDDYYYY!!!!!!!!
Mark:I will show you how much i suffered because i know, i know u guys enjoy watching me suffer Us: Yes,yes we do🙂 🤣
*a super sad ending* Mark: WHEEZE
9:20  don tmind this just for me remebering where i was ;-;
Freddy: *gets disassembled * Everyone: “OMG THATS SO SAD..😢” mark: *visible confusion*
3:33 moon went for Freddy’s balls.
Lol the memes are true
Lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Nobody: The beginning of the video: 🔴🔵⚪🔴⚪🔴⚪🔴🔴⚪🔴🔵⚪🔴⚪🔴⚪🔵⚫🔴⚫🔴⚫⚪🔴🔴⚫Good news, it is almost a 🐓
Find me.
I completely agree with marks ideal about the game feeling unfinished, but I’m not gonna make a large discussion about it, because there is a DLC being released!!!! Hopefully this can path up those endings for us… it better
For anyone confused at the last part, Freddy runs to the last place you called him at. That essentially places a marker his AI will pathfind to.
“Disassemble Freddy” has been an inside joke between me and my friend all year it’s tew funny 😂
The way he roasts Roxy XD
The best episode
I saw an animation with this- 27:50
I can't help it, every time I watch the part in which Freddie just runs away ignoring the call for help I burst out laughing. Please, that's hilarious.  I'm glad we can all agree on that XD
Do the “Wet Floor” signs actually make that noise? I haven’t played SB yet
19:32 yea
28:39
ha
FREEEEDDAAAAAAAYYYYYY
27:40
3:55 "Let's begin by removing daddy's face!" I love these captions, man.
28:42 FREDDY FREDDY U B####  Server:Dripxforce died of laughter
12:50
This has to be both the worst and best fnaf because of how janky it is and the lack of direction is crazy but god does the game look so fucking good and how much detail they put in it
Freddy: lol bye
the comic actually made me cry. EDIT: im rewatching this and realizing this comment made me laugh ontop of mark saying that they didnt have enough budget
0:06 good news it is almost a c0c
28:00 was so funny 🤣
The way my soul left my body at 10:48 💀 loved it 💜
I don't really get what they were thinking when they told vanessa's va to speak like that while you're in the elevator
yes We DO enjOy your SUFFERING
God... the Vanny ending had me crying at "You were my superstar"... 🥲
I almost cried at the vanny ending fr
18:08 , If i had to guess, its because they probably want to be as child friendly as possible in regards to the very heavily implied disassemble and dismemberment of a human being in a bunny costume. and comic is probably substantially less graphic than an animation of her being messily dismembered and ripped to shreds by robots.
1:02
13:40 if you look at Freddy's left arm near the bottom (Between arm and torso) you can see something walking by...
This dude childish
FREDDY YOU BASTARRRRRDDDDDD
why is vanessa flirting with a child
Why is the screen shimmering?
Gregory:FREDDY HOW ***** FREDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYY!!!!!! Freddy:Monty does not bite you’ll be fine.
hey there is a secret thhat glamrock bonnie hide of there someting you need bring glamrock bonnie on freddy thats a good end
I nearly cried when he said “you…are…. My… superstar.” ITS SO SAD
bruh yeah
Freddy goes to the exact location that you called him to, not to were you are.😐
Freddy throwing☠️☠️
😂FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
"FREDDY YOU BASTARD!"  Happy one year and one month birthday to this absolute masterpiece of a game
FREDDDDDDDY
Hows its already been a year omg😭 im rewatching it since i bought the game
It’s too bad there wasn’t something happening if you went to the main stage when Vanessa told you to. That could have been something cool
11:44 speed ripoffs smh
28:39  Just so I can watch this on repeat
THE LAST CUTSCENE WAS A COMIC PANEL??!?!?! WHAAAAAAT.
"Not now Gregory, I need to find Gregory" 28:31
Anyone else think those little yellow caution robots are so fucking cute. No just me?
11:34 24:18
28:03 THE FRAME
18:09 I also think that he gave us all the endings to animate and they had to do an eidt with the comics there is only one animated ending I hope that in the dlc apart from the bugs they make animations of the other endings hopefully 💓😭
Me: really wanting/hoping Mark would go back to the main stage for Venessa's surprise, Mark: just standing on the main stage being really confused and frustrated that nothing is happening, Me: wishing that I could tell Mark to look around the main stage for Venessa's surprise and being disappointed that he didn't even try to go back a second time even though he said that he really wants to know what the hell is happening or going on with Venessa........
That intro caught me so off-guard
Mark absolutely cracked his voice more than ten million times screaming FrEdDy
Bro I got an ad for a restaurant called Freddy’s 😭
30:05 it’s been a year and Mark hasn’t found me for not clicking on the links
Freddy: (dies) Mark: (confused wheezing and laughter)
The game: Makes freddy get dissembled and gregory cry cause freddy helped. But Mark: *silentness during the comic and just questionings if they ran out of budget for the last animation*
*Mark not being able to get into the recharge station* "Are you serious/are you serious right now" x47
Idk why but I was at home alone (15 years old) and I decided to watch markiplier to make me feel like I'm not at home alone lmao 🤣
Freddy dies-mark makes jokes  Mark screaming for Freddy-  “Let’s see if it’s funny now, b^/ch”
When does freddy betray him
"Good news! It is almost a cock!"
When freddy litterally ran last you and you were just scream FREDDDYYYY 😂
29:20 FREDDY!!!!!
Kinda surprised the ending of Security Breach didn't just have a stock photo of some guys desk with a posted note that says "draw later"
27:54
PLEASE SOMEONE COUNT HOW MANY TIMES MARKIPLIER SAID « FREDDY ! »
Here's my take on the Vanny ending (and for non-D&D nerds I'll make this easy to follow)   I'll equate this ending to a part in (Spoilers for Tomb of Horrors D&D 5e Edition) where you meet this big ogre with a crown who goes on about how he's the lich that you have come to this place to kill and that he was gonna kill you, but it is a joke of a fight and when he dies you are supposed to describe it as "he just simply puffs into smoke" or some shit that's super underwhelming because it's supposed to throw you off and make you think: Oh well that was easy, and also very anti-climactic and kinda dumb, there has to be way more.   The ending here in SB kinda does the same thing but in a much, much more forced way. The jarring transition into the cutscene, Freddy suddenly getting ripped apart when he OBVIOUSLY could have taken the bots had he went after them when they were separate and coming after him, the shitty quick 5 minute run followed by random comic book cutscene. It all just is so bizarre and weird even for this buggy, glitchy mess of a game. But I feel it's supposed to be a "It seems forced and anticlimactic cause it is trying to get you to go back to see if there's more" But the way it does it is so shitty and quick and gives no time for any build.   Besides, it doesn't help the fact that it comes after a choice to stay or leave the pizzaplex when obviously there wouldn't be such an important choice that locks saves if you do stay. Having the third Vanny option is kinda stupid, just have the leave option make something happen where Gregory walks out and as he looks behind him to wave at Freddy, we see Vanny and the security bots sneak up on freddy to maul him with Gregory unable to stop him.  It could be just as quick, but way more effective of an ending if it was like that and obviously there's probably a better way than whatever I just came up with in my head in 5 seconds but the point is; the third option was unnecessary when you already eluded to there being secrets and more to find, the Vanny option seems out of place.
Did- did Vanessa attempt to seduce a child?
28:43 HELP ME LMFAO
28:42 😂😂
mark: gets caught  from the security bot..       monty: hey little guy mark:FREDDYYYYY freddy: runs past mark like 5 times
mark did u know they added a save point after six A.M. now
i show speed copies
In the most saddest moment markiplier is wheezing
Just realized this video link has "bruh" in it. Pretty fitting for the ending of this game lol
It always freaks me out when Gregory disassembles Vanny because Vanny is Vanessa which is human, so the bots took apart a human
Jumpscare Timestamps - Part 7: 3:33 Moon 7:28 Moon 10:45 Moon 12:23 Moon 27:52 Bot 28:26 Bot 29:13 Monty
I think the reason freddy was running around mark like a chicken with it's head cut off is cause every time mark would call him he would stop at every place mark called before getting to mark. So, let's say mark called him in 3 different places and then again somewhere else, freddy would stop at those 3 places before getting to the fourth. Mark couldn't stop running from monty, so he couldn't wait for freddy to catch up
🤣🤣 my favorite part near the end when he's running from montey
These speed clones are getting on my nerves 11:55
At the end, I bet Mark was SO pissed at Freddy XD
Can you just imagine Marks neighbors hearing him scream "FREDDY!!! FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!! FREDDY NO!!
Mark is terrible at paying attention. The game specifically said "you will not be able to use the charging stations". He proceeds to head to a charging station to hide from the moon.
meow
Freddy I need u Freddy oh let me hide inside u FREDDY U BITCH😂
Knock knock
Mark screaming so much for Freddy to come the Freddy runs past him 🤣😂
The only reason Vanessa offered Gregory to join the membership program is because she did the same and that's how she became Vanny... by like working her way through the program and then becoming possessed or something like that...i watched a YT video about it
fnaf!!!
Does he do the leave ending at some point? Havent seen the rest of the series yet but i need to know
mark: HAHAHAHAHA!!!!! me:R.I.P freddy.... i love you fred.. bro i literally cry when i see that! he was your dad! he helped you! he loved you! and you make fun of him for dieing 😭
Mark: "Click on them or I will find you" Me: Okay! I won't click on them!
My power went out right when mark got jumped scared ut cut his scream PERFECTLY!! Last night!
its the "FREDDY YOU BASTARD" and the "FreDDiE!!!!!"
Mark: **screaming out his lungs for Fredy after he ran pass him in emergency** Background: **daycare music** (I died at this moment💀😂😂😂)
Oh boy, that was emotional... :') At least we got to... discover what "Gregory" looks like.  Didn't know Freddy could make facial expressions. That's interesting though. ÔO  (Yeah, I'm not familiar with FNAF at all... but, it feels like I'm watching a movie 😆)
7:51 This scared the living hell into me.
27:53 Freddy Betrays Gregory
I love how when moon is chasing Mark, he alwas has to reply to moon
Nobody:  Literally nobody:  Mark for half the game: “Wha- what?- huh?-“
"Are you Sirius?" 🥲🥲🥲🤣🤣🤣
Freddy running past Gregory is what makes this Mark’s best FNAF video reaction
28:44 is literally me whenever I watch FNAF 😂😂
Who would have thought after all these FNAF games, Mark would be screaming for Freddy for help
I want to just walk through this whole game and take notes on the actual info you're given as the player to understand the storyline and then have a sit down with the dev, storyboard and launch team and be like... yall. The entire point of this game was to build from Help Wanted's tape story line like... even if you assume everyone has a MatPat level knowledge of the universe, this playthrough until the optional ending tells you so little and is so clunky and dysfunctional that even a thorough understanding of previous lore doesn't save you from being extremely confused. It kinda makes me mad. I know they've gone through and debugged it some but these endings, even cleaned, do no justice as a callback to the "hidden/real" endings from the past games. The concept is so cool to see it fall apart like this is frustrating. I wish they'd given themselves more time to really delve into the story they wanted to tell in this and connect it back to Help Wanted in a well written way rather than "you know vanny the bunny". Idk. Ik Scott himself got lost in the og series and tangled in his own storyline to the point that he passive-aggressively made comments in FNAF World and UCN but this a cooperation with a world pre-made for it to delve into and the ability to tell their own version as desired with the allotments provided by Help Wanted that you would think Steel Wool, with all of its promotion, team and professional development claim to fame, would be able to write a coherent story, buggy game or not.
“Sad moment”  Mark: “ *did they run out of budget or something?* “
I think they built the map before the story and that's why there is so much unused space
Good news! It is almost a c*ck!
The way he screams at Freddy like FREDDY!! FREDDY YOU BITCH!!! FREDDY!!!!! is Hilarious😂😂😂😂😂
28:14
Mark saying what happened made me die so hard
FREDDY! FREEEEEDDYYYY! FREDDY YOU BASTARD 26:26 can I enjoy the comedy stylings of snaff bot?
vanny end
14:28
14:12 How did he get the option to go after Vanny without decommissioning Monty? Was that a glitch?
12:41 Why did Vanessa talk in a seductive voice? I'm very concerned.
28:30 I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING AT THIS SCENE
This game is so bad 😂
Did the thing Vanessa says to do ever do anything? I haven't seen it do anything, and i'm unsure as to if it ever came of anything
Gregory: disassemble vanny Freddy: Gregory, you just killed her
27:56 the staff bot made me let the tablet fall and get a heart attack cuz I was wayy relaxed and BOOM
dude. 28:00 best part of this whole series, pure comedy.
FREDDY DOSENT GIVE A DAMN AND A BICK AND FUCK ABOUT GREG
IF YOU KNOW GRAYSTILLPLAYS I WISH HE PLAYED THIS GAME AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
ALSO HIS ANGER MAKES ME ALWAYS WANT ME TO CIMIT SUICIDE AT MYSELF
FREDDY LEAVES HIM AND GOES THROUGH A DOOR AND DOSENT COME OUT. MARK BE LIKE:FREDDY FREDDY WHERE YOU GOING FREDDY FREDDY.AND ME BE LIKE NOW I SEE WHY HE ALWAYS HAS ANGER ITS BEACAUSE OF FREDDY!
Find me mark lol
It's incredibly stupid how they don't have some sort of follow mechanic or adaptive pathing for Freddy for when the player needs him but is forced to run around from where they originally called for him. Chica can (or could at least, idk about the updates) freaking teleport and the other main animatronics have following mechanics, so why not Freddy?
10:21 or so when he starts screaming “vanessa”, as a vanessa myself, i feel seen
Rewatching this to relive the torture Steel Wool put mark through with this broken mess.
e
at the end of this episode was absolutely amazing!!!🤣🤣🤣 i nearly fell out of bed while i was watching 😂
28:45 28:54
the way he says gLEANed <3
28:37 Mark: *about die* Freddy: Don't worry I'll go to the other  side first and then I'll go to you.
Not me answering “yes” whenever you asked “are you serious?” x)
Mark screaming freddie as he runs past Monty Kills me every time 🤣
17:53 I know I'm supposed to be sad and all but come on why this?
The game: u can't use the recharge station during this part Mark: *immediately forgets this like 3 times*
The game: the recharge stations are offline  Markiplier: IM GONNA HOP IN A RECHARGE STATION
“I refuse it to be the end!” Of what Mark, u scared? 😏 also, what tunnels huh?..
When Mark said “I know one exit” I thought he smirked and I thought he meant inside Freddy 😭😭
28:34 - 28:52   “FREDAYYYYY”
27:52
27:55
Freddy: not now mark I gotta save mark… oh wait
28:38 **Monty Chasing Mark** Mark: Freddy plz let me in Freddy: F*ck this sh*t I'm out (Blastwing Chirping) (Blastwing Flys away) Me: Yeah you're on your own for this one (Cloaking Device Activates) (Flys away)
I got a domino's pizza comercel as soon as the credits started
28:00

Man that Vanny ending is absolutely gruesome, considering what those bots did to Freddy when they disassembled him, while Vanny's human...
"If you don't, I will find you." **leaves door unlocked and sits in the dark**
Mark screaming is literally glitch ing his mic
You are my superstar is a reference to Super Mario Odyssey
28:41🤣🤣
I think they should have ended the game where it turns out Freddie was using you the whole time to upgrade him and get rid of the other robots and then he turns on you just as you're about to leave. Can you imagine how Mark would react if that happened? Like he did all that, got lost in the laundry room only to have Freddie kill him right at the end 😂
4:44:44 BEST PART
27:53 the moment you have all been waiting for
28:41 "Today on top ten anime betrayals-"
Assuming Vanny is a human, “disassembling” her should, and WOULD be traumatizing to an average child, but maybe Gregory isn’t average.
Freddy really said "Fuck this shit I'm out"
28:32 Freddy running like they were selling the last bowl of exotic butters for 99% off on the next floor
Y'know, rewatching this series again, I am amazed at how many things I missed on my first watch. Like the fact that every time Mark got frustrated and lost it was entirely on him for not following instructions or assuming the game wasn,t working properly.
FREDDAAAAAAAAAAYYYYY
Btw freddy teleports to you when you press the calling button but it only brings Freddy to when you actually pressed the button so him running away is because he went to the place where you originally pressed the button
Vanny looks very creepy 🐇🐇🐇🐇🐰🐰🐰🐰😰😰😰😰
he goes to the initial point that you call him to. Unfortunately you cant spam the button
Epik video 😂
He got sun plush
Not fredbear. Funbear
Sequence
Put moon in hell
Freddy lives
Freddy died
Mark: Freddy? Freddy: I missed the part where that’s my problem.
Mark: Freddy don't wait your turn God dam it Monty: I'm gonna get you!  Mark: Freddy pls Freddy now now Freddy now now Mark: FREDDYYYYY, FREDDYYYYYY  Mark: FREDDY YOU BITCH FREDDYY
I can’t see the vanny ending without my head going  FREDDY FAZBEAR WHAT HAPPE- *_SQUID GAMES‼️_*
the description doesnt say "the end of fnaf" anymore lmaooooo has mark given up on calling games "the end of five nights at freddy's"?  (to clarify i mean in past games he's said "could this really be the end of fnaf" but in this one he says "end of security breach)
11:46 these ishowspeed clones smh
It is because it became 6:00
Freddy how could u run past mark like that . Lmao that made me laugh
looking this back now after lots and lots of people did deep dives into the meaning of security breach and mark talking abt how partially unfinished and unpolished the game feels (27:00 ish) i feel like the game carries SO much lore that they really wanted to tell. however it’s not easy to tell a story that complex and long (in terms of fir example how vanessa applying for the job has importance but then also freddy breaking down at the show has importance and many bits in between). so to me it seems like in the end the bits that were needed tho create a somewhat coherent storyline (that’s also understandable and playable and enjoyable for new people) were picked for the main gameplay up until gregory has the chance to decide between leaving, staying and vanny, leaving the deeper lore, that’s also probably barely understandable for people new to the universe for the stay option. also because once you choose stay there isn’t that one goal you’re working towards like with gregory wanting to get out but heavy exploration of the whole area and the actual story, giving the player really time to dig as deep as they want
And that's how you kill a franchise
I will never not wheeze when mark calls out for Freddy at the end and he just completely runs right past him causing mark to get caught. Funniest thing in this entire series, must be payback for laughing at his death
11:35 Are you serious right neow
I just thought of something that mat may wanna know but could sun and moon be the souls that is in golden Freddy or they are in place for him but with moon more out like in the books that one can control who moves and who can see out of the animatronic in the short stories
Anyone Notice durring the dissassamble Freddy cut scene Freddy has the Monty claw upgrade even though he hasn't destroyed Monty yet 🧐 15:26
Disassemble  It will never be safe...  Damn.  Gregory knows about the disappearances?  Gregory about to go Super Saiyan after that ending...  ~  Mark Theory?  FREDDY!
Well you are close mark actually the way Freddy used to work is he runs to where you initially pinged him and had to go there before he could move to the next ping now Freddy will run straight to you when pinged
Oh I don't, YES I do! No i Don't? YES I DO!
I got got that ad for the army, and every one of their accents sounded completely fake
I cried 🤣
DONT WAIT YOUR TURN, FREDDY. but superstar… you should always wait your turn. 😰
Freddy: Not now markiplier! I have to go save markiplier!
this FNAF is great because its not scary but is instead funny, the jump scares are hilarious,
27:50 this is the best
11:34 Mark not listening to the dialogue explain things always amazes me
i feel you mark ESPECIALLY WHEN I CAN NOT SUMMON HIM OR FREAKING BRING HIM TO ME WHEN I AM TRYING TO GET IN THE RECHARGE STATION!!!!!!!!!!!!
That was funny at the end there that freddy just ran like a confusing rat and mark was yelling like crazy then died by Monty damn the must have ran out if budget
rewatching this LP for background noise and god I still can't believe how buggy the 5: 50-6 AM section of this game was (is?). I fucked up & got this on PS4 and was genuinely worried I wasn't going to be able to finish the game at this point, because before I figured out I could pause & let the atrium load in without letting the in-game clock advance, when I rushed to the atrium I'd fall into the void
I like how hard they tried to make it sad
21:01
9:11 Mark found a rare Vanessa dialogue
Good news. It is almost a clock 🤣🤣 the intro
6:00
Mark found a secret ending💀💀💀💀
You did it 👏 🙌
26:46
You scream like a girl
Mark froze during the vanny bad ending
Ok
As mark goes and talks about how there was another way the game was planned out, I can’t help but agree. I think you where intended to come back to the pizzaplex for five nights and Vanessa would’ve helped you out. I think it was planned out for her to be the good guy in this series but they just had to keep adding and cut corners and it just leaves security breach a muddle mess.
28:43 LMFAO!!!!
WOOOOOW THEY REALLY PHONED IT IN AT 17:00 or so. Holy CRAP!   “Guys, we really don’t have time to animate a scene, so let’s make it just like a comic??”  “But no other part of the video game involved a comic in any way, shape, or form…why would we show the end of the game as a comic?!”  “JUST DO IT. HAVE IT DONE IN THE NEXT TWO HOURS.”
This game started as a nice full release of a game, and by 6AM in game, it becomes a super buggy alpha version of the game. Literally the further you go into the game, the more unstable and nonsensical it becomes, which shows that the coder monkeys were probably getting a whip cracked at them to hurry up and finish it.
I totally understand people's point of view that the storyboard is cheap and makes it seem like they ran out of budget, but what people fail to understand is that drawn art is actually very difficult to do and takes a lot of time to master. The storyboards are a stylistic choice I reckon, and I'm all for it! 3D animation is great and all, but it can look very forced at times, and can turn out looking very cheap. Say what you will about the storyboards, but I really like them personally!
DID THEY RUN OUT OF BUGGET AT THE LAST ANIMATION? I LAUGHED SO HARD
I like editing Mark.
Game: The recharge station isnt working anymore Mark: Proceeds to try the recharge station about 100 times
i loved you reaction at the end "Freddy!! Freddy you bitch!! FREDDY!!!" it was hilarious
Mark: "Freddy, you idiot, come!!" Also Mark: *Keeps pushing the button on different places so Freddy gets confused.*
I think the "Vanny ending" is just so stupid. Why would you waste time and money for that shit? YOU LITERALLY DIDN'T NEED IT! Nothing happens!!
wait was this really almost a year ago!?!? i swear this was this year...my god...
Freddy: "there are wondrous colours and objects that I never knew existed"  Me: "Freddy have you been doing drugs again??"
I feel like hes yelling at me LMAO 10:18
well, goodluck for finding me... jajahahja
FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU B*TCH  Best moment ever of FNAF security breach
28:40 OH MY GOD Freddy please Freddy ! FREDDY FREDDY YOU B!TCH! FREDDYYYYY
28:00 oh i can't stop Monty Freddy Freddy please Freddy Freddy now now now Freddy Freddy FREDDY FREDDY!!! YOU B-
18:00 mark turned into a gose
Coming back to this almost a year later and it still makes me laugh that even Mark, after all he did to try and give the game the benefit of the doubt and to enjoy it, he still couldn't believe his eyes at the final 'cutscenes'.
FREDDYYYYY. FREDDY YOU BITCH!  FREDDDDDYYYYYYY
i still can't get over the comic book strip ending what was that
28:42 XD
23:00 power has nothing to do with Freddy attacking you he attacked you because you went somewhere you weren’t supposed to go remember?
What’s your fav❤ afton? *respond in replies😊*
why doesn't anyone talk about that part in the elevator with Vanessa and the following nothing at the Main Stage as if it isn't the most confusing moment in this whole, very confusing game, it just feels  like something is missing  also Freddy says he can't leave because he a recharge station but in the "true ending" freddy IS outside the pizzaplex, and as far as I know they didn't steal a whole recharge station
At 28:45 Markiplier the opera singer
Mark: FREDDY!!!!!! Come here and give me a big hug buddy!!! I really need you!!!   Freddy: Not now Gregory! I have to save Gregory!
I love Markiplier videos it's so amazing, awesome, cool, spectacular
Everyone:monty is slow don't worry Monty chasing mark:are u sure Freddy:sorry pal
I don't think he realizes that they didn't break freddy, if you watch carefully he clicks the thing to summon Freddy on the top level then runs down and doesn't click it again after going down the stairs that's why he ran past
It would’ve been so cool if all the upgrades for Freddy were completely optional but also served as big quality of life improvements to the player. Then towards the end of the game something happens to make Freddy turn on you (this was likely originally supposed to happen due to info found in the games files), then the final boss fight would be hiding from Freddy, and if you gave him all the upgrades he would be damn near impossible to beat since he would be able to see you through walls and maybe even stun you with his voice. If you didn’t upgrade him, however, it would just be like hiding from any other animatronic. This would’ve been such a good payoff to the whole subplot about wrecking the other robots for your own gain, and it definitely would’ve wrapped the game up in a better way than the endings we got, which barely provide any closure.
The Vanny ending feels so rushed. It just plays an animation to let you know Freddy won’t be with you, teleports you to fazer blast, takes you all of two minutes to get to her hideout, and plays a crappier animation for the ending
Freddy was like nah son he abandoned you literally he abandoned you then bastard he said come back you bastard he just left him and it started waiting his turn behind Monty that was just a chef's kiss
7:32 Mark: what happened?  Me: *constantly rewinds but sees nothing and asks the same thing* 😂
i still wonder how a small watc lasts for the entire game but a robot dies in 2 mins of low power
were gonna ignore the fact freddy had the claw upgrade in the scene?
11:45 bro wants to be speed so bad
You serious
You serious
You serious
You serious
16:55 game in a nutshell
I like to imagine that after they kill vanny, all the body parts are like organized in a blue print like manner.
Exploring your new GTA 5 bunker be like.
Am I the only one who hears random static in these? Please tell me it's not just me-
27:50
FREDDY YOU B*TCH FREDDY !!! 🤣😂🤣😂
What happened, what happened, what happened, what happened...  What happened was that I got you SURPRISE!  *Funtime Freddy*
Mark: FREDDY I NEED YOU Updates: yeah no he has to go to the first place you called him =) Mark: *FREDDYYYYYYY*
FYI: Moon will jumpscare you, even inside Freddy, there is no animation for it, but he basically tears open the chest cavity to get to you.
Vanny is glitchtrap
HELP! NOODLE NEEDS HELP! HELP ME!!
You kept dying by moon because you ran out of time, lol
game: adds freddy as a useful and necessary tool for avoiding bots mark: nah *sprints past em*
im cackling at the way mark calls freddy. i was over here crying for this big, father like animatronic and then mark degraded him to a cute but useless pet
14:00 WHAT disappearances!? Seriously was half the story for this game cut?
13:20
vanny is thic tho
28:40
MARK SCREAMINF FREDDY HAS ME FUCKING CRYING LAUGHING I LOVE IT SO MUCUH
18:02 mark: *nearly sneezes to death, laughing *
28:40 I found the best scene cuz the way markiplier was screaming at freddy- 💀
28:00
seems like they didnt implement freddy's call to update everytime you call him. so he goes to the first place you call, then the second, third, and so on
27:52 monty chases mark while freddy toys with him
Moon man got you bc he reached fred. Moon can get Greg. Even if ur in Freddy. Moon can open Fred's chest cavity
Freddy: hold on markiplier, I'm trying to find markiplier
18:07 now that was just plain mean
I just found out that some Gregory skits are from this video
summon this video in one sentence from the video   !!!FREDDY YOU BITCC!!!
Mark missed a Circus baby plush on the counter
hmmm i wonder what the issue during developement is...
28:39 Freddy was like “sike you thought”
5:25 I'm so sorry Gregory, i thought you was in Brazil
The start of the vid “Hey Mark, that’s not freddy you saw almost get in the elevator with you…”
Freddy: “You are my superstar” Mark: *wheeze*
PARTS OF THE VIDEO MAYBE YOUR LOOKING FOR?!!!: 0:07 not really a big moment but funny! 6:26 is when I think moon starts chasing him. 7:28 is when Freddy moon got mark 9:10 is important because of Vanessa  10:03 main stage 10:36 moon disappears???!! 10:43 moon jump scares mark but in a funny way 13:19 one ending 14:52 Vanny option! 15:25 Freddy 🥲 15:38 Start of Vanny boss fight? 16:06 Roxy! 16:36 Freddy!?? 17:05 Vannys room 17:10 story time!! 17:29 Vanny!!😤 17:40 no Freddy 19:49 story time again!! 20:00 starting again! 24:25 Movie time! 26:45 Cute movie! 27:57 Freddy running past mark 28:44 “Freddy You B!Tc4!” I think that’s all-
the fact that mark didnt’t get to enjoy the comedy stylings of STAFF bot and instead was confused by the practically a-posed robot is so amusing
How awesome would it be if- There was a fallout 4 powerarmor mod that added "Glamrock Freddy Armor" I think it'd be cool.  And weird. but neat.
Freddy's so cute saying that nothing can hide from him. I mean, it sounds so pure.
HAHAHAHAAHAAA
NO DEAR LORD OF FREDDIES!! I ADORE HIM i cried..
28:41 “Syke, bitch! Monty’s your problem.”
The culmination of 'FREDDY YOU BASTARD!' floored me :D
......sooo was Vanny - Vanessa in disguise? I don't get it.....
28:00 -  29:18 be like:  "FREEEEEEEDDDDYYYYYEEE!!!!!" freddy: *"nah i'm alright for the minute"*
28:37 priceless LMAO!!!
Theatre is utilized u just picked poopy fazer blast first 🤷‍♂
Little kid sneaks into pizzeria after closing and uses animatronic guards to brutally murder innocent(?) furry woman.
When the ally got the Getty blame it ALL on the Freddy!
FREDDY CANT HELP YOU IF YOUR RUNNING ALL OVER THE PLACE
21:15 Whoaaa Mark, pause 😟✋🏽
you are have to beat prinses qest 3 to get good ending
I don’t think yelling Freddy over & over like a teenage girl on her period calling for her dad is gonna help in the game it annoys me that you yell loudly at a game for no reason over & over as if it’ll change things.
Gregory, i am about to do the most nastiest gritty
They just had to have Monty chasing Markiplier waiting for Freddy.
vanny kinda bad tho
I just love how mark refuses to call moon drop by his name and instead always defaults to moon man
One would think he would have noticed by now that Freddy doesn't seek you out when he is summoned. He goes to your location where you last summoned him. That means if you run away from the place, he would not follow you. It's not that hard to notice.
Wtf why haven’t they finished the game😂 how are you gonna make the most important cutscene in comic strip form🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bro this game is a mess😂😂😂 I haven’t seen the rest of it but why did they release it before it was finished
When mark was screaming Freddy was so funny
Moral of the story kids: Don't stack commands!
18:00 Mark Hyperventalating
after freddy dies XD
XD
what was that
what the hell XD
XD
This game plays more like Alien Isolation than a FNAF game.  Your stuck in Pizzaplex/Sevastopol Station and you are on these missions that you need to complete to escape the place.  Vanny and the Faz gang are like the xenomorphs constantly stalking the hallways and the cleaning bots are like the Working Joes that you try to avoid.
Mark screaming Freddy reminded me of Petey screaming "Judy" in K.C. undercover.
i can't even imagine how much better the endings may have been if we had just given the devs a few more months. i don't understand how the gaming community hasn't learned their lesson abt harassing companies to release games. we get rushed shit then cry about it like it isn't our fault when 80% of the time it is.
that vanny ending was absolute shit
7:26 he just literally went to the door right In front of him and then he got jumpscare
Mark what was with this screaming dude at this part 28:45 you sounded like a stressful girl don't get upset about it okay? But you were really funny at that part
28:42 top 10 anime betrayals
Jesus loves you
I really hope they fix the game. It was a great game but it really has a lot holes and issues. Still love the Fnaf games though
Even with Roxy’s eyes being able to see things through walls, Freddy still couldn’t find himself any bitches.
If you go and get that robot head again the saves return again
rip freddy 😭
If someone made an animated version of this like they took the entire thing and just made it like animated and cartoony
28:42 i can't stop laughing
11:28 Freddy with Roxy’s eyes.  28:42: Also Freddy with Roxy’s eyes.  xD
Is it just me or does stressed mark sound like Bdubs?
This is the best Markiplier quote "FREDDY YOU BITCH" "FREDDY YOU BASTERED"
3:27 i like his little dance
What happened?
Freddy: not now Gregory I’m saving Gregory
27:57 - 29:17 is the funniest part of this series
Freddy was running around because he is making the most of his new eye upgrades.
27:57 freddy is about to betray mark lol
Would've been nice if they had bothered to finish the game before they released it
I wish the Pizzaplex was real so I could go and ask Glamrock Freddy about lore. It all just looks so cool!
"Good news! It is almost a clock!" That one broke me. That's hilarious
Can someone tell me why that last part was in comic
NOO FREDDY
reddy azbear 🤡
i think theyre serious
Mark: * Screams Freddy Repeatedly while being chased by Monty * Freddy: “GOTTA SAVE GREGORY GOTTA SAVE GREGORY GOTTA SA— Oooo is a that a gift shop!?” 28:42  Edit:Wow so many likes…Thank you!
So sad when Freedy ran past Mark the moment he needed him 😂
Well the Vanny ending was pretty harsh. And it says it’ll open back up next season. I guess glitch trap will have to find another bunny figure since Vanessa/Vanny was killed.
are we just going to ignore freddy at 25:41 ?
*no time Markiplier, gotta go save Markiplier!* -freddy
"did they run out of budget for the last animation?" that actually got me lmAO
It's funny that Mark gets angry at Freddy for not turning up, but the game is so buggy and the mechanics for Freddy is he turns up at the last spot you pinged. So him being impatient and spamming the button is just breaking Freddy causing him to not turn up. so regardless of mechanics or bugs that whole scenario is entirely Marks fault!
freddy:{struggling to say his last words} mark: {chaotically laughs}
15:07 this always makes me wanna cry
Omg this is the funniest thing I've seen today😂🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
22:19 Mark was almost having a heart attack.
When Vanessa said go to the main stage
"FREDDY YOU BITCH" -Famous last words
"did they run out of budget for the last animation?" No Markimoo. They, like other game creators. Decided to hire a smaller artist that they thought was good to give them some love and make ending scenes or story feel more like a "made at home experience". Apex Legends did this too and probably even more games. Its honestly really cool! (Not being a dick I promise. Love your content 😭😭)
Mark: FREDDY YOU BASTARD  Amy: what the actual fuck— is you ok???
I love how the article at the end of the vanny ending just says “blah blah this article has nothing relevant to the game” 🤣🤣🤣
Mark: "spamming the summon button" Freddy: "I forgot where that's my problem
Gotta love how Mark completely forgot about the shortcut from Rockstar Row to the Atrium, which is a much quicker way of getting back to the entrance than the long hallway (and also I found out the security office at the beginning of the game doesn't even let you out into the area where Chica walks in a circle the hard way, I was trying to shortcut my way to the entrance for some reason and instead had to go all the way back)
Mark had it all wrong when it comes to how Freddy is summoned; where ever you were when you hit the button to call him to you, he goes to THAT spot, so spamming the button while running does NOT help.
Freddy = Iron Giant. You cannot change my mind
I love it how Mark screams "FREADYYYYY!!!" like that Fready can hear him🤣🤣
I kinda hate how he both missed the most exciting parts cause he didn't think it through enough or just plainly stuffed himself like that time after the kitchen when he missed the robots having a meal(?) on the stairway cause he simply looked over it. HE also goes into areas before he's meant to and ignores a lot of things that the game tells him
Mark: WHY CANT I GET IN THE RECHARGE STATION?! Also Mark: Ignores the tip that says they are now offline.
Mark just cry in the vanny ending
26:45
I almost feel bad for laughing at the end loop.
The canny ending nearly made me cry tho 🥺😭
Freddy leaves mark at the daycare mark: FREEDYYYYY Freddy:WHAT? U GOT THIS
27:52 Timestamp for the funny part… you know the one.
when you repeat yourself over and over it's really annoying
Freddy literally getting an eye upgrade: wow i can see through walls  Also freddy: Cannot find 1 Child   Lmao
I think this ends like this because maybe they are making a new sequel of them but in the future
ah yes,the "whatchemahoozet" -markiplier2021
28:00
7:38 HELPP
I hate moondrop
27:52 comedy fucking gold here
28:00 !!
28:00
27:51 around where the chase is
When Freddy delivered that you are my superstar line I lost it, especially when the rest of the comic wasn’t voiced. The bugs is what made the game for me to to be honest, would’ve been far more boring otherwise
Game: The charging station will be offline so you will not be able to use them.  Mark: Aight, let’s go hop in a charging station.
17:57 this was probably one of the most accurate reactions to this cutscene  legit I get this was supposed to be a aesthetic choice but it just looks like they ran out of budget for the last animation like mark mentioned which is kind of weird because they made 2 animations for both endings that ending and the true ending which makes sense I guess for the true ending a.k.a. the Afton ending but why didn’t they just make animations for all of them hell some of the endings don’t need to be high quality animation I mean seriously 🤣
don't blame Freddy, he forgot you stayed and didn't just fricking leave.
You know thrs like 6 endings
Moon came from the back
“FREDDYYYYYYYY!!!!” “[Applause]”
Love you mark
I've noticed these changes. 26:09 The comedy staff bot tells bad jokes on a later patch. 27:25 Those doors are security level 10 locked on a later patch. I don't know why though.  Also that ending with Freddy running past Mark while Monty is chasing him was hilarious.
26:34 so fun fact: the bot on stage is actually supposed to give a lengthy comedy routine, but the trigger for the event is broken and will only activate upon _leaving_ the theatre. but to be honest, i think the bot just standing there saying nothing is arguably funnier.  edit: you all need to touch grass.
But freddy dies even with the upgrades cus he has monty claws in the cut scene
This is wrong order monty dies on part 7
27:57    Meme TiMe
20:38 thanks talking door
Everyone : crying bc freddy died Mark : did they ran out of budget for the last animation?
28:38
Freddy☹
but isnt vanny human so what they do to dissemble her
25:09 sounds like someone is knocking my door
freddy singin fuck this shit im out
freddy be like you got this later
Freddy- dies  Mark - confused wheezing
Fradddaaaaayyyyyy
21:04
Who else got actual ear damage from how much markiplier screamed in his fnaf 3 series.
ok but it is almost a clock im gonna go in 4 hours
honest to god wonder what he thought to believe that there was actually something at the main stage
17:44 😟😭 11:19, I just realized has mark not shot freddy eith the blaster yet?
26:28 *“snaffbot”*
This is why i love watching markiplier, his rages are hilarious
When calling in Freddy he's called to your CURRENT location which means if you run away he will end up where you stood when you pressed the button. It also seems he doesn't change direction until he has gotten to the destination so spamming the button is a very bad idea. I'm sorry Mark but it's not broken, just not designed to be used running and spamming...
best line - FREDDY YOU BASTARDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Well I mean it was pushed back once or twice so it was a bit rushed at the end so it's understandable that the ending was a comic strip
the way Freddy just zoomed past Mark as he's running from Monty had me cracking up so much omg
30:04 It’s just a game. See? He’s smiling as hard as he can.
there is secret rooms! :O
10:44 Screw it Moon is a straight up demon.
Mark screaming for Freddy as his voice keeps rising in octaves
0:09 I love how the game's telling you to get to a recharge station but ALSO telling you they don't work anymore. 11/10 game design right here.
U wont
17:10 I know this is just a video game and all but I’m actually gonna cry😭😭😭
We can tell he is going to go rage mode by his talking in the end
Why, whenever a cutscene happens, mark just says, "wat wat wat wat wat wat wat wat wat wat wat?????????????????????"  Seriously, when roxy got hit, when he went against vanny, and when he finished the game.
Is the plan a mission just a glitch???
i am so stuck in the golf thing
How high pitched were those screams of 'FREDDY!' when Monty was chasing him? lol
28:42 See ya chump!
Bro disassemble vanny..... thats really dark man
28:00 THIS MADE ME CRYYYY 😭
28:40 was the best part
Mark: are you serious you serious rn you serious are you really serious Me: stop saying serious
You wont find me
ngl super happy theres more than a bullshit comic
Somehow Mark saying "Gimme it! Gimme it!" instead of "Give it to me! Give it to me!" makes it funnier and reminds me of many other videos I watched other than Markiplier's 😁
28:35 :) ---> XD
Freeeedddyyyyyy😂😂😂😂😂
29:00 why dident you hide?!? If you would have hidden the moment Monty lost you you would have survived   Oh well too late now
3:27 Moon doing a cute lil dance ❤
15:10 why does the Cutscene show Freddy with Monty's Claws when Mark hasn't given Freddy the claws yet
feddy
Even if Freddy betrayed the King Of Fnaf we love him <3
why couldnt mark enter the recharge station
MY FAVORITE PART WAS FREDDY BETRAYED MARK THEN MARK SAID "FREDDY FREDDY YOU BITCH FREDDY"
"FREEEEEDYYYYYY! FREDDY YOU BASTARD!" HELPPPP CUZ WHEN FREDDY ABANDONED HIM COMEDY GOLD
FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Freddy be sounding MENACING when he says "Let's end this" like he finna kill someone lmao 🤣
That funny how mark scream for freddy and freddy betrayed mark
AC: Comedy of staff bots Freddy leaving a child to get chased by a robot alligator: You sure about that?
“There you are YOU ASSHOLE! I’m never gonna make it now” Lmao I’m dying 😂😂
Is it just me ot did nobody notice that when Markiplier found one of the endings aka the Vanny ending  The last sentence is "Im memory of Mike Hoffman" So- they made an ENTIRE game for someone? Thats gotta be very kind of them.
FREDDYYYYYYYYY
when he goes freddy pls freddy freddy now pls freddy
there are 12 endings
mark: i will find you, i will find u *says in a scary menacing way* me: yes dadd- i mean oh no im so scared dont find meeeee-
mark: "there is something else going on here" me:...GLITCHB*TCH!
*Greg crying when Freddy dies* Roxy:   ✨🖕🏽WHOS THE BABY NOW BETCH🖕🏽✨
k N n n
moon is so annoying I don't even get scared at his jumpscares anymore
To this day, I have no idea how Mark found his way out of the pizzaplex
When Freddy gets disassembled at 15:27 he has Monty’s claws despite Mark not getting them yet
The whole layout of the game, reminds me of Alien Isolation, minus space and the xenomorph, however still a big facility with robots and Androids walking about. Helping Joes
27:53 - 29:23
Ohxk kgxtk kgzkyd
I wish Freddy would’ve fought back against the security bots
Freddy:Gregory  Gregory:what  Freddy:Gregory  Gregory:what  Freddy:GREGORY Gregory:WHAT Freddy:hi  Gregory:HI
I feel like this whole game area would make an amazing Garry’s mod map. Being able to just explore it without fear of getting killed would be wonderful.
7:37 lol
holy--  that moon dude is enough to scare the eyeballs out of roxy, no car crash necessary
the wet floor signs are still the best part of this series
i know he's joking but i feel like he is coming to malaysia and find me ;-;
mark: im going to a recharging station cause moon man cant get me there  game at the beginning of misson: charging stations are now offline
The Vanny ending made me cry. If only hate had'nt gotten to Scott. Thank You Scott for creating our childhoods and thank you Mark for bringing it to us poor people <3
So Roxy couldn’t see the moon guy??
29:16🤣🤣
27:50
The fact Mark never came to realize that when you press the summon Freddy button he doesn't notice that Freddy goes to the spot where the button was first pressed. The amount of stress I felt watching him run past and Mark not understanding why (ಥ﹏ಥ)
Freddy: Gregory... you are my superstar... *dies* Everyone: Crying     Mark: *Did they not have enough budget for the last animation?*
The fact that he just won’t except the end at 6am is proof that he is Fnaf veteran
You can stil safe
OMG the way Freddy just ran straight past lol
!!Freddy!!
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭noooooo freddddyyyyy!!!!!!
I used to watch to you all the time, but this whole repeating everything 7, 10 plus times is so irritating. A couple 2, 3, 4 repeats okay fine funny haha but after that its just nerve gratingly irritating. Its a shame, I know I can't be the only person fed up with it.
Freddy:Gregory u want to stay  Gregory:VaNnY Freddy:Gregory what are u talking about Gregory:vAnNy
If you choose the faz cam  then  go to the pirate poster and flash the people on the poster you get in sun’s room
You know it’s bad when you come out of that Freddy death cutscene feeling emotional 😂
Why did vanny need the glam rocks to hunt gregory when she has an army of staff bots? and why is it they can so easily knock over and shreddy freddy?
I'm pretty sure all of Mark's dialogue parts are actually dialogued by darkaplier
It seems Freddy is summoned to the location your were standing as you pressed the button, not directly to your location. So when you start moving, you'll see he runs by you to the location you were.
You could try seeing if you can do that mission after you made it to the exit
[Video spoiler alert]     The freddy death ending was literally ridiculous, in graphics this game is INCREDIBLE, in everything else, its the worst. I think the freddy death was supposed to be sad, but it was literally horrible and got literally no emotion
(markiplier screaming for freddy) "FREDDDYYYY" (freddy running past him and being a pain in the ass) he really said help yourself superstar! 😁 literally hilarious af
Mark: Not Like This My head: fnaf 6 Henry Emily speech: Not like this
"FREDDY!!!!! FREDDY!!!!!!!!! FREDDDDDDDDYYYY!!!!!!! NO NO NO FREDDY!!!!! FREDDY!!!!!!!"
The way mark laughed Abt the last animation when Freddy died and said you are my superstar while I'm over here getting all emotion over some animatronic  😭
9:20 vanessas voice oh my god
dam freddy betrayed you
7:37
"Good news Gregory! It is almost a cock!" had me deceased 0:00
GOOD NEWS! It is almost a COCK
why is most of the game like JUST BLACK
17:57: sad moment markiplier : indescribable gibbering
Who else cried when Freddy died? Yes I did, I couldnt help it damnit!! 😭😭
28:41 killed me the way he screamed for freddy
Mark sounds like helium
Mark:WHY CANT I ENTER THR RECHARGE STATION game:it’s the end
WHY DONT YOU GO TO RE CHARGE STATION
I love how Mark didn’t give up at the FIRST ending, this is why he’s one of the favorites :)
Mark: phhhh phhhh whatt
I knew Mark's misunderstanding of the Freddy Call mechanic would come back to literally bite him in the ass one day. lol Freddy did exactly what he was supposed to do: come to the position Gregory was in when the button was pressed. We see this several times throughout the playthrough when Mark calls him while casually exploring, and Freddy runs right past, to where Mark was standing moments earlier.
You have Chica’s voice box! When Moon was chasing you you could have used the special scream skill her voice box gave Freddy. It was actually painful watching you struggle so much.
Mark, for eternity: "are you serious? are you serious? are you serious? are you serious? are you serious? are you serious? are you serious?"  The Instruction Card that only popped up once: *"THE RECHARGE STATIONS ARE OFFLINE AND CANNOT PROTECT YOU"*  The Game subtitles at 5:55am: "FIND A RECHARGE STATION!"
I hope a future patch includes the cut minigames, Monty Golf Holes 10-18, Survival Mode, and a couple patch fixes.
Noone:  Kids in supermarket after they don't get what they need: 30:28
i was dying around 5:15 when freddy was going the total oposite where Mark actually was XD XD XD
21:15   ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Freddy be like: THESE EYES ARE SO GOOD I CAN SEE EVERYTHING! EXCEPT WHERE THE ONLY FUCKING CHILD IN THIS DAMN BUILDING IS LOCATED!
The “good news it is almost a cock” killed me
28:47 lmao!!
best line ever 14:27 " vanny! " " gregory what do you mean? " " VANNY!"
just the way his voice sounds FREDDY FREDDY DONT WAIT YOUR TURN DAMN IT!!!!!
Can someone explain...?
the first thing mark asks when he sees the ending literally is: "did they run out of budget"
anyone reads this, i am on a journey to watch every single video in this playlist. 95 episodes of mark, five nights at freddys, and me. I simply ask you pray for my safety
28:52
27:56
It's kind of fascinating to see Mark actively trying to engage with the game and getting punished for it. This game is that friggin' broken.
28:42 F R E D D Y C O M E B A C K
aw that first ending is so sad :’((((
The way he kept saying what happened what happened what happened what happened till his head exploded was to funny😂
Use the gun on moon btw I am getting security breach tomorrow
Why does Gregory look an awful lot like mark? Is Gregory secretly Mark? Lol 😂
I hate that the cold open (?) got me lmao
Why is Vanny curvy tho?
such half-assed endings, honestly made me not like this game, can tell they just half-assed the entire game
Mark is seriously losing his mind
i was about to comment “where was moon man from 5:50-6am” until moon man appeared and just ripped gregory apart
I'm with Mark on this, this game feels unfinished and when you step out of it everything felt very clunkily put together. Like for example Bonnie and Bonnie Bowling, it makes you want to know what happened with Bonnie and why he was replaced, Freddy seemed sad about it, but we don't get anything. Same with Moon/Sun Drop, I thought there'd be some way to force them to switch while they were chasing you, but no such thing is programmed into the game. This seems like a cool set of ideas that either was way too much for the development team to actually put in the game, or development was cut short so the game could be released.  The older fnaf games also have this polish to them that this one lacks, maybe it's just because this is the first time we really see the characters move around but there's the issues with characters getting caught on stuff, or when the Roxxane sequence didn't work quite right the first few times. Maybe it's just because compared to this one, the past games have always been rather small and self contained, but this one just feels like an unfinished mess.
mark reacting to the vanny ending was just 👌
They really cucked us over with this game. It had SO MUCH potential
28:00
17:18  *Starts hyperventilating*
That was funny when freddy ditched mark he just went hi bye have fun but mark yelling at him that was funny
19:47 read the text on the newspaper. I guess Scot got tired of Matpat digging for lore xD
8:11
Freddy Freddy please Freddy Freddy now bow now Freddy!!  FREEEEDDDYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!
18:01 Are you criying or are you laughing. İf you're criying YOU ARE .....
freddy died when gregory most needed him. gregory probably ended up dead after freddy in the pizzaplex next to his fallen friend. i made a tictoc theory video with my cousin after that and people asked why my maskara was runny so you can see that. we think gregory is a robot because of a deleted ending. timestamp of credits  also makes us think sun is also on gregories side. btw kellen goff is a fnaf icon
Freddy dies* mark , wheez wheez wheez*👄
I watched this at midnight. and now im scared if any animatronics open my door and randomly scream at me to find my parents even though they are literally next door-
huh i wonder why he couldnt get in the charging stations OH YEAH BECAUSE HE DIDNT PAY ATTENTION AT THE START AND IT SAID HE HAD TO GO TO THE MAIN EXIT
ok but am i  the only one who notices the "bruh" in this videos youtube URL??
there are 3 endings
vanny is vunaes
Freddie death ending hit hard. He was my favorite character in this game. 😕
LMAO WHEN FREDDY RAN PAST HIM
of all the mysteries about the plot of this game, i just want the teleportation powers of the animatronics explained. it doesn't make sense as JUST a game mechanic to fuck you over, not really.
Idc that the comic for the Vanny ending was apparently based on a horror comic, the arts good but it really looks like they lost budget, would’ve been better animated l.
Freddy at 28:40 was like: hi Gregory bye Gregory
I hate this game. they wasted their time. the fact that the starting animation was so good and then u get disappointed the rest of the game.
freddy: you are my superstar.....*dies* me:*realy sad* Markiplier:*starts laughing* me SRSLY?!
28:02-28:42 Here is the part you guys came here for😂
Mark: Panicking and calling freddy Freddy: Not now Mark There's no time! I have to go save Mark!
Mark’s scream of “Freddy You BASTARD!” was so full of anguished rage. I need that as a ringtone.  Also, why are Freddy and Gregory talking about the disappearances as if they’ve fully discussed and fleshed out the story between them? Like WE as the players know about the odd disappearances and the possible culprits but Freddy and Gregory haven’t given any indication they knew, have they?
he screm
I was literally sobbing when Freddy dies and mark is just sitting and laughing-
Jack loves his Faz-daddy and Mark is just treating him like a dog 💀😭
the dogshit design of hey if you want to finish the game you can but no saves so it’s incredibly annoying to do so :) just why make a massive map and punish people for wanting to explore it more
freddy will run to wherever u clicked the button, so if u pressed the button on the stairs he runs to the stairs, and wont run anywhere else until he gets to the stairs....
Door: You're welcome, Mark!
The last part was too much funny 😂😂😂😂😂
wtf is happening 😂
Mark making those weird wheezing sounds after Freddy says "You are my superstar" to Gregory was some great comic relief lol
17:57 the Crying! 😂😂
When they were destroying Freddie I was like"oh no fredward... Oh well at least there's another one we can use "😶
Pov: you didn’t click on the links because you want markaplier to come for you so you can meet him in person
I WILL PUT YOU BACK TOGETHER  THE LOOOOOOORE
Remember to keep comments respectful and follow our Community Guidelines
I feel like they should have kept the five nights thing. Like, each night is a different character. It would give more time in each area, because the areas are really cool and it would utilize them more.
He just kept on saying “ you serious “ 18 Million times.
ah the bad old days when there wasnt an overtime save station in the atrium, mark beat just about everything before it was patched in
😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻 😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹😹
POV: 10:20 your name is Vanessa
FreeddyyFreeddyy!!🤣🤣🤣😂😂 FreeddyyFreeddyy!! It looks like freddy hates you 😂😂😅😅😂😂

Come find me then you wont🤟😎😎
ma rk screaming at freddy is a classic markiplier thing to do
anybody hear that? 23:19
conclusion the game is just buggy
not me yelling at Mark because he needed to get to a recharge station
I think its supposed to go to the place he hasn't gone to that youve called him
Freddy: *trying to defend himself and Gregory, but instead get thrown off the bridge* The stupid bots that Mark hates: *tears Freddy apart cutely* Me: WHY WHY DID- WHAT THE ACTUALLY- I HATE THIS GAME NOW
28:00 No context needed  Freddy dying: "You are...my superstar..." Markiplier: *Dying laughing*
Vanessa , L + Ratio
This is the first FNAF game where I need to push myself to bear with it to see the end. It's so boring, buggy, and a massive dissapointment. I hoped it to be something like Sister Location where it had semi-free roam, great lore and really scary. This is an average game. But an awful FNAF game.
This game is sooo incomplete. Either they ran out of budget, money, or both, but it is definitely incomplete.
For those who don’t know: There was a patch that came out sometime after the game’s release that adjusted the way Freddy acts when you summon him - he now runs to the exact spot where you stood when you summoned him, hence the reason he ran past Mark when he needed him the most (which, if you ask me, was utterly hilarious).
Your videos are very short
Mark apparently didn't see that Freddy said the recharge stations were disabled when you try to leave.
FREDDY FREDDY!!!!       Me: 🤣🤣🤣😂. 😵
Why does Freddy act like a dork sometimes like when Monty was death sprinting at mark
I think it’s in comic form just for less animation work which I accept especially with all the days years and weeks they put into this game
29:17 🤡
Mark: FREDDDYDYYYYYYYY, HELLLLPPPPP, IT CANT END LIKE THIS!!! freddy: Shapes and colors-
This was made  3months ago and one day
The reason the last scean was a comic was because it would be to graphic to show vanny(a human) whould be to graphic to show
I mean um..there's a bug which make you able to use  saves:) I think I'm late with it...
did u know u can glitch into the daycareand spawn all the animatronics broken or just explore even go I'n his room since he wont be there
this game is shit lolll
Imagine Amy decided to have friends over when this was recorded and they just overheard mark screaming at Freddy and calling him a bitch🤣
Covid happened, and the games budget wasn’t able to handle it.
18:00 I thought he was a psychopath at first until I heard the budget part… but still no spoilers🥺
27:50 rip bozo
the fact that moon glitched it was funny an it even scared me also i did not expect that hahaha
S
Hearing Mark shriek "FREDDY" at the top of his lungs is just pure dopamine
FREDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU LITTLE BITCH YOU BETRAYED ME HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAAAA
28:41 “See ya, chump”
No freddy...T_T
The two QA testers really sucked at their job.
Me who saw that freddy had Monty's claws in the Vanny ending🧐
When you feel a bit of sadness for the "you are my superstar" Mark: W H E E Z E Me: *Nvm*
can you give me a shout out please markiplier love your vids
Freddy really hates Mark so much
The betrayal 😭💀
never though I'd say this but, seeing Freddy torn apart made me sad
Mark: I will find you.  The Orange Ranger: Don't threaten me with a good time.
There's something so empowering in hearing Mark talk about how he doesn't want the game to end when I, the viewer that watches stuff late, know that there's still more parts
I start thinking this game is developed by Behaviour
Mark someone turned your voice into a meme or trend idk
18:00 😂😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭
Wait I’m confused. What was Vanessa talking about with the main stage? Is Vanny an animatronic or just Vanessa in a bunny suit? Why does Vanny want to kill Gregory? Why is it that Vanessa and Vanny are so different? Is it multiple personality disorder?
i love this buggy mess of a game
Ah yes. The three genders. Stay, leave, and vanny
mmmmmmmm delicious suffering
28:43 bruh
FREDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYY
27:41 the epic moment
When you go to the main stage vanny will get you
28:11 just saving, this part was just the best 😭
3:33 That was weird. 17:55 Freddy noooooooo 😩 24:32 LOL
What the fuck is plan a
28:00
This video was posted on my birthday
this game was an epic flop lol, still good to see a new fnaf game ig
The part where Freddy just ran past him was gold. Had me in tears😂
FREDDY!!!!!!!!
27:52
Most people cry when they saw Freddy die mark just laphes and wonder what happened
7:39 Mark: What happened? What happened?  Lmao it's so endless
Mark: Freddy help me! Freddy: Long live the King.
"There's a surprise at the main stage"  "You're a liar! You're a liar!!"
"get me in you." Ok.
Maybe Freddy just paths to wherever he was called, even if the player moves somewhere else before he gets there.
Did no one notice the news paper says  Bluh bluh bluh on the side
Fnaf Security Breach decided to End.  💔 But Markiplier Refused ❤
14:14 lol
then wtf at le end
freddy is a real shit T-T
*Me thinking that Freddy's death was sad*  Markiplier: *wheezing*  Is he ok????
I like how mark acts all pissy when freddy doesn't arrive as if he wasn't abusing the command button since the first episode.
FREEEDDYYYYYYYYY!!!!!! Omg that was amazing. The last bit was hilarious.
3:51 turn on titles
I don't blame Mark for dying this much, because it's like this game made the worst desicions during the development and it's patches like the 6am feature and that Moon guy
IM SORRY I JUST STARTED LAUGHING MAO.
When Freddy needed to save Mark he noticed that he was low on milk.
28:43
Mark: ok so moon is all the way over there meaning he can’t possibly sprint to me from such a distance… Moon: /tp @s Markiplier
28:43 FREDDY
me: plays vr fnaf gets jumpscared vr fnaf meh  also me: plays fnaf security breach gets to endos gets jumpscared by endos ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
17:51 GREGORY LOOKS LIKE AN ADULT!
I absolutely loved the last part of this video, the way that he was happy that Freddy got there but just ran right past him 😂🤣
28:43
27:56-28:50  *Freddy abandons Markiplier*
“Go check the main stage” am I the only one that hears a seductive voice
28:00
Gregory you are my supperrrstaaaar💀Mark:🫁👄👄🫁👄🫁
The way that Roxy was crying because she got here hair ruined and chica got both arms ripped of
Freddy u BAASTARD😂😂😂😂
FREDDY.. NO nOt thEAaare!!!
28:42 dont mind this its just when i laughed really hard
FREDDDYYYYY YOU BASTARD 💀
vanessa says that so if you go there moon gets time to get you
0:06 when your phalloplasty is nearly finished
"Freddy, don't wait your turn, goddamn it!"
Mark: FREDDY!! FREDDY HELP ME YOU BISH!! Freddy: 🏃‍♂️💨🧍‍♂️
I am still processing how the robots torn apart Freddy 😭😭😭😖
Mark really went the slowest way possible to get to the exit that was right in front of him at the start, huh.
28:42🤣🤣
5:22 Markiplier: "FREDDY NOT THERE"
Freddy fazbear what happened??????
27:52 is the funny bit (for future me)
Bro I cant stop Laughing 😂🤣    The fact That Freddy Just ran past over Mark And Mark screaming By being chased by monty   JUST TOP HILARIOUS 😂😂😂😂
and the time freddy ran past mark was 28:39
the time mark started to get chased was 27:53
I cried a lot when Freddy said you are my superstar🥺:(
Why u are super funny 🤣
fun little tip, Freddy's HUD changes because he now has Roxanne's eyes. They're no longer electric blue and orange, they're now purple and red.
17:50
I think this was how the game was intended, but between the fanbase going full out berserk and probably other troubled development issues, we got a buggy mess.
Am I the only one that thinks Bonnie got disassembled the same way Freddy did and Monty was framed?
Why did I acctually cry at the end?
The jumpscare at 27:55 I had a Heartattack
This is prob the best intro i have ever seen.
The greatest ending is when you finish all of the princess quest games
Freddy running past mark:  I would help you markiplier but i  gotta go save markiplier  *continues to walk past mark*               Just realized it's the same comment fro mthe animtion i juwst watched ima go c ry
GOOD NEWS, IT IS ALMOST A COCK
i not love freedy it.,s kill
The last animation was too gory to show Vanny being taken apart so they animated it into a comic book
The last animation was to greatest Giovanni being taken apart so they had to make it animated in a comic book
Stop fucking screaming.....I turned my volume down from 40 to 6...
5:00 am I the only one or ...doesn't it seem like the audio is playing at the wrong time of when markiplier is talking like different times I noticed when I was looking at Markiplier talking..
“FREDDY YOU BITCH FREDDY!”
LMAO gregory when he “disassembles” vanny-
27:54 When Markiplier begins getting chased.
Thier are like ten endings
Best part: 27:53
Markiplier: Click the link or I will find you Me: can’t wait to find markiplier
Hi markiplier I love your vids it’s awesome how almost everyday you come and scream and get terrified just for us
28:00
28:40 HAD ME DYING
22:34 / 25:01 Markiplier's nightmare. Baby Plushie from Fnaf Help Wanted (vr) :D
27:52
28:35
When you died for no reason it became 6am and you die
That 2 staff bots banged Vanny, god dayum
When Freddy died Mark:[cries 😭😥]
27:53 just a time stamp nothing special
I love the fact that the dev team released some patches and added a charging station into "Overtime" and that the patches themselves used up all of my brand new laptop's disc space. Great game overall though, and props to Mark for sticking through all the way. The also gave the Comedy Bot in the theater his own show.
Mark: (screaming for Freddy) Freddy: *runs right past him* Mark: Yeah i'd rather choose the vanny ending Monty: Freddy aint u gonna help the man? (Not what he really said but thats like i think how mad he was)
Nonono its ok, Freddy's just gotta go get some milk real quick! He'll be back!!
Markiplier it said near the start that the recharge stations had been disabled lol
Is no one gonna talk about the fact how Vanessa spoke to Gregory in an “odd” way?
AT 18:00 made me laugh most XD
I died laughing XD
there cant be 2 freddys
Freddy: You are.. my superstar. (dies)  Mark: *confused wheezing*
why he go back to ness
This game is so realistic, Freddy betrays Mark lol
Vanny is will A.
There's so many bugs, and unanswered crap, and the game is kinda bad because they forced it to finish too quickly. They had more planned for it but were pressured into making it faster and releasing it. So it had the potential to be one of the best games.
he needs to do a  animation video about this
Wait... the lights are on now. Does that mean sun guy is back now?
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation?"  Yep, that sums up how I felt about that as well...
That ended badly
Markplier: sanitation is not a priority over here 😂
There’s still a Monty to maime 😈
Tell me everyone cried when freddy died 😭
It might be the best intro ever 😭✋🏻
Anyone else notice the awkward stare Freddie gives mark in the elovator
not me and mark thinking the same thing that they ran out of budget for the ending💀
*Gregory needing to be at the exit before 6 AM* *Freddy not taking this situation seriously, running in circles*
i love how hes not even crying then im just sitting in puddle at the end scene
i mean, the cutscene and comic style stuff is cool and all but what...this game is all over the place from start to "finish"
Yes they did run out of budget
Theres another couple of endings, so they are fun to watch on a channel called CoryxKenshin
Every other youtuber: Adopting Freddy as a father Mark: Adopting Freddy as a dog
I love freddy
*Choices - Ending* Leave - Really Bad Vanny - Bad Stay - Good Stay and collect all items - Very Good
Game: The recharge stations are down at 6 am, so you can't hide in one to get away from the Daycare Attendant Mark: That sign's not going to stop me because I can't read!
18:00
Glamrock freddy is Micheal afton:he glitches because Micheal afton gained control to protect his younger bro, Remember the family that represents the aftons, one head missing one with red pony tails with roses cheecks, blaoria
I couldn't stop laughing at him trying to go to the charging stations over and over, despite Freddy saying they were disabled every time the moon man appeared.
I like how you screem "FREDDY YOU BITCH"
the fact that I got to the one scene with Vanny and sad music playing from my google home did not help... wtf
Mark: *franticly trying to run away from Chica* Freddy: *you got this, superstar!*
3:52 LMAO TURN ON AUTOGEN CAPTIONS
5:10 Freddy being a idiot
power stations offline  mark: so what if i go in a power station?
17:50 almost cried
That theater staff bot was supposed to tell jokes. For some reason he just didn't tell jokes in your run. Very strange
Mark: FREDDY!!!!FREDDYY!!!!!!! freddy:waits turn*
Five Nights at Freddy's: father's betrayal
Freddy: u are my super star mark: wtf
When Freddy runs past Mark when Monty is chasing him; 28:39
Okay this is a random thing but I wish there was an ending where if you like stayed in the pizza Plex and did nothing for like an hour then you get the re-opening ending where kids actually start to come in the pizza Plex and it's like one more normal day but you have to take down the place without the kids knowing and then you get the reopens ending
Feddy.
>stronk
The wease made it less emotional
Freddy: *dies* Mark: *WHEEEEEZE*
I love how Mark screams Freddy’s name as if he could hear him through the screen
28:42 SOBBING
I appreciate mark’s commentary about the game’s development, it sums up how I felt too
The problem is that Freddy goes to the spot whereyou last summoned him and not where you are now (that’s just a guess tho)
i only kinda enjoy your suffering im not a complete monster
freddy ignore/betrayed markiplier lol 28:42 and new mission Plan A 10:45
im late but does anyone notice the video link has a bruh in it?
FREDDY YOU BASTAAAAAAARD!!!!!!
28:40 Freddy's leaves him.
Great part mark!
I got a theory! So the endings are comics so the events of security breach never happened because it was all a comic
Game: gives players a map Mark: well anyways…
Mark: *getting chased by Monty* FREDDY! HELP GIMME IN GIMME IN Freddy : walks past mark Mark : FREDDY YO BITCH  FREDDY !!!! FREEDDYYYYY!!!!!!!! next second  Mark : *gets killed by monty* Mark: OMG FREDDY! FREDDY YOU BASTARD!
this game is the saddest thing ever, because if it was actually filled out with the gameplay and story it obviously wanted to set up with bonnie and all these unexplored areas, and wasn't so god damn buggy, it would have been absolutely phenomenal. but, just like the pizzaplex itself, it was way too big and set too high of expectation to fulfill any of it. keeps me depressed about the series to this day.
*BRO WHAT IF THE PLAN A MISSION IS THE ONE WHERE WE GO DOWN THAT GLASS TUBE AND VANESSA IS LOOKING AT US! MARK IS THE ONLY ONE TO HAVE SEEN THE MISSION ACTIVATE SO NOBODY KNOWS!*
"The recharging stations will be disabled" Spends first half of video trying to get into charging station. Mad props to Lix, I already know that Mark is a sadist abusive asshole and you hide that well, but having to sit through and edit all his legit stupidity must be soul sucking. You are an awesome editor, I hope you find a better content creator to work for soon.  Edit: The series that started his career and he spends the whole time in this one talking shit about it like it was designed bad. You hate playing it so much Mark, then stop. Or should I just add whore to your list of descriptors...
Ok so here's a criticism of the game why disable saving at that point? If you choose Vanny you obviously aren't going to get a chance to save given your being swarmed by enemies and the fact that you can finish that ending vary quickly so saving isn't really a factor there. For leaving obviously that's just a bad/not real ending so again saving isn't a factor there. For staying you've just been given a new upgrade that helps you find collectable so obviously you'll want to explore and use it but since you can't save if you die like mark did you lose those collectables and have to start all over witch is a pain in the ass. Why not let us save when A you just gave us a good reason to explore to get collectables and B the stay choice is obviously the for the main/true ending. If we want to get the collectables and and true end we have to do it in one go without dying? That's bullshit. Through I don't know what's past this point in the game but if you do get to say save later then why not just let us save earlier here and save us the the trouble
29:17 why the hell did you leave him in the first place???
FRESDYYYYYYY FREDDY PLEASE PLEASE FREDDY REDDDYYYYRYDHDEHU HELP ME HDHDBEH
the start of 27:55 until the end killed me 😂🤣
28:57 He probably could've survived if he just waited there and called freddy for a bit instead of checking on monty actually
OK OKOKOK SOOOOOOO they decide to animate the ending but not the begening ok yea that makes totley sence (sorry if i spell things incorrectly)
28:38 i’m literally crying 😂
that last bit was to good
The meme of this that people have been making of this
I guess Freddy didn't believe in Mark
good news! it is almost a coc..... Clash Of Clans!!!!!
I’ve been binge watching check 28 or 29 of 95 so yeaaah I’ve watch many hours of fnaf
Markiplier died a lot by MoonMan the daycare attendant, Not to be confused by Farkle's Moon Man who is undoubtedly the best rapper of all time!
Who else knows that Vanny is actually a human and not a animatronic, so the worker bots just killed somebody. LAW SUITS ARE COMING
19:18
as much as i enjoy watching markiplier play through these games this episode gave me a real headache because of the screaming when he just ignored what the game was saying :(  also it's pretty funny that freddy gets broken because of the amount you try to summon him, so he goes to the point where you clicked the button the first time
Freddy do be STOOPID tho
I just started dying when Freddy left him with monty.
Hey future me, it is around 28 minutes or so. Enjoy.
Mark: when he gets caught by the security bot FREEDY FREEDY FREEDY FREEDY FREEDY FREEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDYYYYY BITCH COME FREEEEEDY FREEDY SON OF A BITCH FREEEDYYYYY OH NO DONT WAIT YOUR TURN FREEEEDY FREEEDY!!!!!!!!!
Mark:thanks door thanks shut door
Mark:what what what just happend what just happend.
sad ending  meanwhile markiplier: confused af
unless i can go... its past your bedtime....
18:15 Mark low-key sounding like Chewbacca
After watching these videos I don't know if these games should be made for children anymore lol. They just keep getting freakier
Ending: being emotional  Mark : did they run out of budget for the last animation? *dies*
the choses: stay leave vanny   Freddy: gregory, do you wish to stay, leave or vanny? Mark: *really confused* uh... what do u mean by "vanny"' Freddy: *silence* Mark: uhm, i choose vanny!  Gregory: "we saw her hideout, why not go surprise her?" freddy: let's go then! Mark: oh- oh, what? wha-what? huh, wha-  vanny: disassemble freddy.. *presses button* mark: *absolutely shocked*  wha? w- what? i- wha? what? wha- what? what happened? what? *still really confused* what just happened?!    (i thought that was funny)
yes i do,no i dont,yes i do,no i dont,yes i do,
other people during the vanny ending: noooo freddy noooooo*cries* markplier: DID THEY RUN OUT OF ANIMATION*LAUGH*
Mark screaming Freddy’s name is one of the best things I’ve ever seen in his fnaf videos.
Mark:why are u here your Early  Freddy:good news it’s 5 a clock  Moon literally following them: who said your getting out?🙂
Quiz: How many times did Mark say Freddy when he got chased by Monty? Start at 28:00             Edit: The answer is at least 30 times.  Also Mark: His Body’s Response: -Fast Heart Rate -Adrenaline Rush -Completely Sweating -Stress Level Rising -Emotional Breach -5 Stages of Grief   Markiplier: Freddy! Freddy: Nope.
HELP THE WAY FREDDY LEFT MARK
Freddy and Monty chasing mark for 5 minutes is just absolutely stupid and halairous
28:35
There are 16 about endings
10:26 VUANEEEESAAAAAAAAAA!
One shoot for every "FREDDY" he says...
They had no right to make me this emotionally attached to a video game animatronic!
The Monty Freddy chase was hilarious
That sudden jump to the Vanny bridge lmao
Vanessa looking kinda fine in that suit... What have I become
Oh shit so Gregory and Freddy were both fully aware of the disappearances the entire time
I love how it specifically says charging stations won't save him but he keeps going
Freddy's Navigational Function brought to you by Roronoa Zoro
I think the jump scare where mark started saying what happened, I think that we might of broken him
MICHAEL DONT LEAVR ME HERE MICHAEL! 28:44
vanny kinda bad tho
✨Miss Vannnyyy💅✨
seeing freddy die in that vanny option    *my soul hurts*
FREDDY! FREDDY FREDDY. (Freddy walks past him) FREDDY YOU BITCH! *FREDDDYYYYYYYY*
11:30 dude, the 6 AM Message said: Recharging stations are not available anymore to
28:45
Hi
FREDDY FREDDY PLEASE FREDDY FREDDY NOW
HELP 28:42 AMJAISCDVSBH
“Go check the main stage ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)”   *Mark noooo!!*
Somehow it hurt to see Freddy dead
🤣 I’m dying
Freddy running into a wall on 28:35 got me laughing
They really know how to make a fan cry RIP Freddy🥺🥺😭
How dare Freddy do this to you
Freddy: Sorry no time to talk right now Markiplier, I got to go save Markiplier!
What if Gregory is a kid who was kidnapped? And he escaped, and so that's why theres no record of him being there, and no one reported him missing, and why everyone in the complex is after him.
After seeing this, I'm _definitely_ taking the route of waiting until it's patched into a better state to decide if I want to buy it. Kind of a We Happy Few or No Man's Sky situation.
Pretty sure Freddy's just not updating his pathing until he finishes a path. Which means when you spam the button he goes to the *first place you hit the button at* and is ignoring every press after that until he gets to the original spot.  ...which causes problems when you're running from an aggressive aligator.
im staying after schools watching this lol
Vanny it's not Vanessa pal!
27:54 a
I think the way summoning Freddy works is its a point and click and he comes to a certain point, but they just need to put some sort of beacon to indicate where he's running to!
28:16 my favorite part
“Freddyyyyy you bitch!!!!—-Freddy don’t wait your turn you bitch!!” 🤣🤣🤣 I can’t!
Mark: Get me in get me in- FREDDYY Freddy: (passed mark) where's gregory? I must find him
“Or I will come find you…” Ya? Like Freddy found you? Oh wait….
Never thought mark would be hoping it was Freddy and if five nights at Freddy's game
You'll find me? I mean i was gonna but now im just gonna wait XD
Freddy: You are my Superstar... Dies* Mark: Dying cat* Also my favorite part 28:36  the betrayal
BAHAHAHAHHAAAAAAA FREDDY JUST DUN LEFT U LMAO
Thought Freddy said you needed medical assistance cause he knew the lady was coming and knew you didn’t want to be caught so he hid you and distracted her for you or something like that
28:43
14:55 So this is the suppose ending when Mat Pat broke it.
the fact that he didnt use the fazerblaster when running from monty
The “Did they get out of credit for the last cutscene” go me dead 💀
💗⭐💗⭐💗⭐💗⭐💗⭐💗⭐💗
gregory… ya nos cargo la chingada
IM SCREAMING WHEN UR TRYING TO RUSH WHEN U CAN JUST GO THRU THE MAIN ENTRANCE 😤
Anyone gonna talk about the intro? 💀✋
they didn't run out of budget they just wanted maybe family friendly :0 I guess
Mega brain Mark. he is so smart
28:41 Mark: FREDDY!! HELP!! Freddy: *Aight, imma head out.*
Ah yes. Animatronics do get quirky at night. He was programmed to follow your given location. Not to follow you around like anyone else.
6:00
He checked charging stations when it said they where offline
FREDDY!!!, my boi
@22:35 why do the wet floor signs do that?
Game: tells Mark to go to recharge station Mark: *completely ignores and does other things*
When Freddy ran past him I lost it 😂
28:43 I'm shitting tears lmaaaoooo
Mark: your not that fast Moon: u wanna bet  Moon:shadow clone justu
10:53 - I wonder what the Faz-Watch would say under "Plan A", I'm so curious now!
I really want to know where this story goes and I really love mark but I dont know how much longer I can watch Gregory run around in circles upgrading his stupid party pass. The core gameplay loop in this game seems exhausting and chore like. A step down from sister location imo
POV:you are crying when freddy dies
T_T WHY DID YOU CHOOSE VANNY?!? ITS SO SAD.
They for some reason haven't made a prize on the stage yet lol vanny tricked ya
Not mark getting Fooled by vannessa 😭
Death by moon man.....lots of death.   Freddie screwing around when Mark needs him.  A bad ending.   "But hey, that's just a theory. A MARK THEORY!
FREDDAYYYYY FREDYDYDYDYDDYDYDYYYYY FREDDY YOU BITCH    28:40
I'm your fan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can you do more videos please I love your videos please do more of five night at freddy,a I love it
28:40 The best fucking thing I have ever seen! Freddy just runs pass the terrified Mark!
this game is so buggy lol
Mark is amazing but the whole time he was looking for the charging station I was internally screaming because at the start they said something about the charging stations being out of commission.
HAHAH WHY DID I GET EMOTIONAL WHEN FREDDY SAID "You're my superstar" IN THE COMIC TO GREGORY THEN STARTED LAUGHING
Moon Man name is moon drop
Kinda glad I just watched mark play this lol
17:49 lmao here
Last saved 2204
When you needed Freddy the most and just ran past you, I lost it 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Freddy being lost 5:10
Running away from monty and freddy leaving him is the funniest thing ever
*watches mark play five nights at Freddy's while making a vanny mask* Hmmm
Smiling like a maniac, heavy breathing while talking about links in the description, and the eery tone... Mark is about to lose his fucking mind.
i dont really enjoy mark's suffering because he's trying so hard to complete this and sometimes he's blind (same as me) so mark.. I dont enjoy your suffering but i feel you suffering IT IS NOT A GREAT FEELING..
Mark: What happen what happen what happen  what happen what happen what happen, what happen is moon man killed me
But Freddy won't be able to find YOU!
Enter the charging station already!! 10:00 have passed already!!!
27:57 The Mega Pizza Chase
the noise he made when he did vanny ending tho
Top 10 Anime Betrayals
You can feel Markiplier's rage when he chose that scene for his ending
I like how I’m like on the verge of tears when Freddy dies when mark is laughing
rip freddy i cri
28:03
Why is it that whenever the pause thing happens and Mark explains the video it gives me Lemony Snicket vibes
Freddy: *runs past mark while he is stressing over time and finally getting there when he's about to die* Mark: THERE YOU ARE YOU ASSHOLE
Freddy LOL XDXDXD
I got this ending too, but I got it way too soon, I think I glitched it because I got the ending after I beat fazerblast, I hopped over the fence that was closed
Why didn’t mark push the big green button on the MainStage when Vanessa said there was a reward there 😭
Chase starts at 27:43  28:41 Freddy will go to the place where you last called him. So if you call him and move he won't go to you, he'll go to the place you last called him.
"It's not a mistake", ✨IT'S A MASTERPIECE✨
So, I just realized something: In the first episode (I think), when Freddy takes Gregory to the medical emergency room, I don't think Freddy actually thought there was something wrong with him. I think Freddy was trying to hide Gregory because he either heard or could somehow tell that Vanessa was nearby and didn't want him to by found by her. I'm getting the feeling that Freddy knows more than he's letting on and isn't telling Gregory/us because he's a child and his program probably has it where he doesn't want to alarm him (not that it works, since we find it out on our own). It could also be that Gregory didn't want to be found by the security guard so Freddy appeased him and lied to Vanessa for him.
thank you to marks editor for including 0:06
Freddy!!! 😭
EVERYTIME the streamers or YouTubers need to escape and EVERYTIME I feel like I should tell them there’s a short way to the main atrium it’s so frustrating
I mean sure if you can find me
Blind roxy could find Gregory better than Freddy does WHEN HE IS CALLED
I will not listen to distractible until MARK personally comes to find me
28:00
IT WAS ONE WHOLE NIGHT AT FREDDYS 😭
Hehehe
Oh Freddy don't wait your turn godamnit. Freddy Freddy please Freddy Freddy now now Freddy now now Freddy. FREDDY! FREDDY! FREDDY YOU B*TCH? FREDDY! FREDDY!
"Gregory. This is a very important choice you have to make. You can either Stay, Leave, or *Vanny."*  "...What?"  *"V a n n y"*
Freddy disobeying mark and he’s making that sound 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
28:01
Clicking leave is the real ending and there is also like 3 or 4 other endings
these lets plays always wig me out because i am also named freddie and mark is just profusely screaming my name lmaoooo
Like, this game looks fun to play and it's fun to watch but like, I'd be so fucking lost like all the time, I have a terrible sense of direction, especially in huge maps like this
It was a bad design choice to make Freddy run to where you were when you last summoned him, even if that means running by you. It'd make sense if you needed him to stand certain places to do things but you don't
Gregory: **Is crying for freddy** Mark: *did they run out of budget*
Me when mark says there's something else going on inside the pizzeria:  IT'S THE MAN BEHIND THE SLAUGHTER *vibing*
I like how everyone cried when Freddy dies scene but when mark gets it he starts laughing. He truly is a different breed.
You: "I will find you!"  Me: Wait...you're Monty, aren't you!  😮
14:30 ok why does mark sound exactly like Freddy 😂
yoble isak
reblox sa yome isaknoolo markplayer hagoiu 🤣
28:43 is by far the funniest part
Glamrock door
FREDDY YOU BITCH  no matter how many times i watch this that line will always make me laugh
“FREDDY!!, FREDDY LET ME IN-“ 28:43
11:37 yEs
28:44 nothing made me laugh so hard than mark screaming “Freddy you bitch! Freddy! Freddy come back!” I almost fell off my chair
that is not the main stage
I want to point out - Right before the chase at end?  _Freddy was running out of battery._  So even if Mark had gotten to Freddy and escaped Monty... *FREDDY* would have eaten him!
21:41
Well mark i think that your theory on this stuff not being used is partially correct i just think it'll be used later
Mark yelling for Freddy is like calling for your dog but he runs awaya
28:50-29:20 when he starts getting chased by moty and friend is just chillin being blind even tho he got new eyse
29:14
Mark to Freddy: "GET ME IN GET ME IN" Freddy continuing to run past him: "Yall hear somethin?"
28:39 i was dying 😂😂😂😂
Mark XD there’s MULTIPLE ENDINGSSSSS XD stop being confusedddd
Good news it is almost a cock
28:18 LOL
FREDDY NOOOO please 🥺 I couldn't believe i would ever love Freddy so much 😭
28:00 what most of us came for
Sun be safe nooo Moon teleport yesss
you know, this game reminds me of the original Dead Rising
Game: has sad end where Freddy dies.  Mark: haahahhahahahahahahahahah
I love how you can hear Freddy frantically running around everywhere as Mark tries to call him
Stay is the cannon ending
No that’s the ending you picked
It is the end
The fact that Freddy just ran past Mark when he needed him most and then waited his turn to go down the stairs was hilarious 😭
The bot at 27:53 scared me so much
Thank god the previous editor isn't making those stupid edits of him popping up on the screen with his little cartoon character. He edited a lot of content out and would put his face (the character) on the screen too much. I like the original Markiplier gameplay which had raw gameplay with the minimal amount of edits.
28:42 - I laughed so hard.
Please come find me! I would love to meet you!
so i know im late too say but i was meant to say before but i forgot but there are many different endings and if you pressed leave that is the main ending
"Freddy freddy now now freddy now now please freddy freddy FREEEEEEEEEEDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY" "FREDDY YOU BITCH!!!!! FREEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
Fun fact: Freddy goes to the last place you call for him so if you spam it he will glitch out
8:30
"I watch mark because he's very a calm and has a quiet voice "   Mark: 28:34
If you really wanna know why it's a comic strip style ending, here's my assumption; They can't show a grown lady get torn to shreds by robots, not the stuff that happens in some of the other endings, so they figured it was a good idea. And I agree with that.
3:34 AH YES GETTING JUMPSCARED BY AIR
the community rushed them to make the game i think they needed more time
This is honestly so disappointing for a FNAF game :/ this has to be among the biggest game franchises; they have to have the resources to make a better game. This feels unfinished.
28:00 RUN MARK RUN!!!!!
28:45  The meme starts here *PLZ PIN THIS*
The stuff bot does joke but your game was glitched
Gregory-"😢FREDDY😢" Freddy-"💀they/them pussy💀"
Freddy : "Not now, Markiplier. I need to save Markiplier."
28:04 FREEEEEDDDDYYY!!!!!!
I’m dying at the end FREDDDDDT FREDDDDY DONT WAIT UR TURN FREDDDY SCREAAMS I CANT
I cried when Freddy got torn up😭it was so emotional
7:40 mark screams "WHAT HAPPENED?!?, WHAT HAAPENED" Though it just became 6;00 AM Lol UwU
omg please do find me im a big fan XD
why does vannesa have to make it sound like that "a reward" in that voice
Cfderdx
mark:FREDDY COME HERE NOW MONTYS CHASING MEE! also freddy:runs past him*Mark: FREDDY U BITCH
I callus hear the pain in his voice when freaddy walked past him
Supposed to probably put her through the food area to pressure on the other side that's how you're supposed to do it then you supposed to kill then you're supposed to kill a person by Saving Kurt start a true friend that that's the only way you can supposed to put over your food. Then put it for that so it's something that you're supposed to do before you do the second part don't go to her yet go to the food place then put her food food then pushed her onto the thing then saver
Mark: Imma just hop into a charging station Freddy: The recharging stations are out of order Mark: *trying anyway*
Show this to ramboo he will cry-
I used to think mark was a kids YouTuber, meaning I thought he mad videos for kids so they were clean and no vulgarity. Oh boy was I wrong 😂😂😂
Freddy is more annoying then ashley from re4
FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY  AAAAAAAAAAAAA FREDDY HEL *dies*
Who Else reads the comments well watching this
I DIED WHEN HE WAS YELLING FOR FREDDY HE SAY YOU BASTRASDEDCFFVGGVBB 😂😂😂
*ends* mark: to fast to HWEEEZE
god that ending though
hi👇                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  hi      byeeee
Freddy when Mark chased by Monty: Bye have a good time
sir you are wrong, i have clicked all the links and will continue to do so with each video
thers is a true endind ill give you three hints youve seen him before hes the man behind he slaughter
mark: *summons freddy* freddy: *goes roxys room* me: oh he wants the only fans password or going to go do some bad things to roxy lol
Moondrop: It's past your bedtime Mark: Um what?
You need all 7 endings to put together and know the real ending
5:11 Freddy was trying to find Roxanne only fans account
RIP Mike Hoffman
27:55 😶‍🌫️
Ytp intro lmao
Bahahah, Freddy be like, the charging stations are offline.  Mark; IMMA TRY ALL THE CHARGING STATIONS!!
You can play the Princess quest games in order there are three of them and that all of the must de complete for the true ending
The purple block is a secret room you will be surprised when you go inside but you need montys claws, the eyes and the voice box to go inside aswell
2:25 actually he probably had a scratch on his cheek because if u look up Gregory FNAF SB it will show u a picture of what he looks like and u will see a bandaid. So Gregory actually did need and get medical help. This is just some of my theory
28:42 Freddy:we do a “little bit” of trolling
no freddy dont wait your turn
At 27:50 I JUMPED SO HARD. i almost fell out of my chair.
Freddy: shut up Gregory! I must save Gregory!
17:53 THERE'S A WHOLESOME ENDING WTF
28:38 you are welcome
mark(getting chased frantically) freddy; waiting in line for his turn.
wtf is the crappy comic ending?
Freddy saying goodbye Me: ahhh, ouch!
This games so poorly made
They spent all the budget on the unused content
12:14
calling freddy is like trying to teleport your dog in minecraft
Anyone else think Mark kept dying because he ran out of time?
Freddy, courageously running into battle
27:53
Mark: Y'know Freddy, I want you to be a pallbearer at my funeral. Freddy: Why Superstar, I would be honored! Mark: Thanks pal, after this whole adventure it just only seems fitting that you let me down one last time.  Freddy: ლ(ٱ^ٱლ)
There should be an ending where gregory leaves and keeps his fazwatch (and the fazwatch works at his home) and gregory can talk to freddy through the fazwatch
20:21 Freddy: [...] The door is open..." The door: isn't open
omg
Gregory 8 year old with no driving experience:drifts topled and smashed a go cart with a small but heavy engine in between Roxie’s eyes 🤔
Freddy running right past him while he’s being chased by Monty will never not be the most hilarious thing ever. 💀
"FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!"
Freddy didn't break, he still moves to you in the same fashion, even if it's from farther away. From what I've observed, when you call for Freddy, he doesn't go directly to you; instead it acts like a waypoint for Freddy to go to. It seems like Freddy has to pass through all previous waypoints before going to New ones.
28:41 Now we know that fredy is a bitch :)
*Mark running away from Monty barley alive* *Freddy on his coffee break* have a good time bud
This time, Mark is the one chasing Freddy 🤣
28:42 XD LMAO IM DYING I CANT!!!  OHH I CANT way too funny!
5:35 freddy dont no where to go
Freddy had one job.
Mark might be right about something going wrong with this game, because in the trailer so many things happen that we never see in the game, we hear voice lines that aren’t even used.
0:07 made me die laughing.
Monty- *chasing Mark* "hey, little guy!"  Mark - *running for his life, turns into an opera singer*
28:00 FREDDY!! Part so I can look back
17:43😭
15:28 made me weep Freddy noooo
PLEASE FIND ME
markiplier in fnaf 1 : "please dont stuff me into a freddy...." Markiplier in SB: "freddy let me inside you...."  Me: "my times have changed, also.... oh my...."
28:43 Freddy was like “NOPE✌️” 😂😂😂
Poor Markimoo yelling in desperation for Freddy with its broken AI, while trying to survive every bot coming for his giblets will forever be my favourite Security breach moment XD
18:03 "the memory of him and Freddy 🍃"
If my big bro can't save he will literally rage quit upon death and never play again 😂
“Freddy you asshole!”
Good news! It is almost a c*ck
@27:59 being chased by Monty and Freddy being unhelpful
idk man I havent gotten fnaf vibes from this game at all - it feels so unfinished
Markiplier - "The party pass will get me in to the whatchamahoozit" Me  - "yes."
Me wanting to finish the game for myself because I wanted to experience it.. Days later my game bugs so I get impatient the same night and decide to watch Markiplier play it.  -AGRESSIVE TEARS-
This made me cry
what is up with those sounds at 23:07?
28:42 "Sorry Mark. No time to chat. I need to find Mark!"
28:00
How how did he guess the whole aft on ending
mark's reaction at the vanny ending is 100% valid
28:00
“Did they ran out of budget for the last animation???” HAHAHA I FUCKING LOVE HIM
Come find me, here's a hint I'm in Alaska enjoy the cold
Remember when you did the fnaf musical 5 years ago
To get another ending get 40 regular collectibles and 5 golden plushies
28:39
Freddy always betrays u
Are you going to cry 😢 because of freddy
How did he take the worst route possible I remember I got it on my first try with 5 minutes to spare
Lol the FREEDY YOU B***
11:40 - You serious?
7:29 -What happened?
Freddy JUST IGNORED HIM🤣🤣🤣
Mark: FREDDY YOU BITCH!!!!!! Freddy: Motherfucker stop spamming my summon button
28:45 FREDDY JUST RUNS PAST MARK WHEN HE NEEDS HIM LOL  "Freddy you b*tch" xD
GOOD NEWS. IT IS ALMOST A COCK. I DIED
i think what they did with freddy was make him run to the exact spot where you summoned him regardless if you moved from that spot so you cant spam his summon, and they make him actually run to places instead of teleporting just out of sight then running to you
*Le me about to cry Mark : Did they run out of budget for the last animation?
12:00
24:34
Yes am serious
Feddy.
27:56/27:57 - 28:02 - 28:42 Freddy: Who are you? I gotta save Markiplier!!
My soul left my body when he ran past mark xD fucking laughed harder than I ever should have.
Hey Markiplier, wussup I was playing fnaf security breach with my friend and in loading docks I got to laundry machines and then vanessa found me in a room. I was upset but I realized, how tf am I in a room still alive and then vanessa got mad and said ill call the cops and ur parents but it was weird because the bunny called vanny said are u having fun yet as she started la la la sprinting at me and it gave me chills so can u contact fnaf creators bc I don't think anyone has got there and it's weird .
Mark walking past like 5 save spots hurts me
27:57
And Freddy was not coming because Mark was yelling at him and he just ran past him and he got sooooooo mad at him and ended the video madly
Yo when mark was calling out to Freddy and he didn't come and Mark died and yelled that was so funny bro
Bro that last animation. Made me cry🥲🥲 That last animation was just🤸‍♀️📸🤔🤕✌🙉
Is Monty crazy fucking fast or is it just me?
FREDDDYYYYYYY
Freddy: you can’t use the charging stations now Mark: not if I can help it
10:16
aww its kinda sad...
28:36 for sure the funniest part
27:51 XDD
"Yes C*m! Let us end this!"
"Good news! it's almost a K*ck!" XD
For the Vanny ending i think they made it that way, because a human being disassemble would be very gore for the children etc...
28:07
You should have tried the "Leave" option before "Stay".
25:54 about this is all probably issues with not only covid but the fact that from what I heard game was rushed due to fans wanting it after delays I think.
the ending had me dying laughing hahaha.
28:42 is pure gold literally said “your on your own on this one i don’t know you”😭💀
mark: because you, for some reason, enjoy my suffering his audience: *are watching fanf play throughs*
Freedy fredddy !!!!!! You...
This game was changed cause the trailer shows alot that that game don't have
freddddyyyy 😭😭😭😭😭
feddy
i love the "FREDAAAAAAAAAAI"
"FREDDAYYYY YOU B" HAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAH THE WAY HE JUST IGNORED U
28:43 got me dying
28:02 when freddy betrays mark..
*"FREDDY YOU BITCH, FREEEEEDDDDEEEYYYYY"*
17:50 this would be sadder if we HAD SOME FUCKING CONTEXT
15:08 if you notice, Freddy has the monty hands in this cutscene... H u h
halo announcer: Betrayal!
I love how when Monty is chasing mark , mark calls for Freddy and Freddy just runs the complete opposite way- 😭
*Freddy goes past mark*  mark: FREDDY YOU BBIIIIITCCHHHH (bitch in a super girly scream)
Where's lixian?
When Freddy ran past Mark on the stairs and Mark screamed, I lost it 🤣
freddy!
Freddyyyyy 😂
You are correct there was alot of things that played different but became cut content like for a example on Vanessa she is actually stunable and in the beginning if you get jumpscared by her you skip alot of things and you go to lost and found as the were on a rush due to alot of people being impatient and so that is basically why there is so much cut content and alot of bugs and glitches
Freddy: “Let’s do this together, superstar!”  *Monty chasing Gregory while Freddy is elsewhere not tending to Gregory’s aid*
Why did the screen get all sparkly?
Every other youtuber laughing because freddy died. Markiplier 😃 What
I didn’t expect to CRY today 🥲
Incase you were wondering with the theories at about 25:57 it seems a conciderable amount of the game was cut so this could be released early.
27:49 I have never genuinely jumped at a jumpscare before, but that was *terrifying*
Love it 28:45
Part two of the meme 28:00
17:57 bro marks reaction was top notch
It' funny because it's hella broken
Freddy was running to the toilet at 28:40 dont judge him
A herring is a fish, my guy
This game has so many bugs in it they wouldn’t of had that if everyone rushed the developers.overall this is a great game!
27:55 best ending to a video
28:43 freddy just running past mark was amazing
Freddy is the real threat
Safe to say this is the most funniest thing I have ever seen 💀💀💀 (Time stamp: 27:58)
Game charging stations offline mark  you serious
MARK: FREDDY!! I NEED YOUUU!! FREDDY: U GOT THIS SUPER STAR AHAHAHAHAAH
Freddy: dies Mark: laughs
18:07 They blew it on the opening sequence  🎊😂
MERHABA MARKİPLER
27:50 us where the meme/havoc starts
28:06 hardcore starts
28:44 I AM FUCKING CRYING OH MY GOD F R E D D Y Y Y Y!!!
27:47 What you all came for
Someone needs to put the Spongebob chase music over the part where Monty’s chasing him.
28:40 What makes Freddy running away from Mark so funny is the fact that Freddy runs *FULL SPEED* away from Mark without even bothering to look back. It's like Freddy was giving Mark brief hope with his appearance, only to then pour bleach into his wounds.
It literally said charging stations are offline
A
It's hilarious how Mark was relieved to see Freddy for a brief moment and then got even worse when freddy zoomed right past him
You can see the fucking mic struggle with the decibels of screaming
28:45 FREDDY FREEEDDDDYYYY FREDDY YOU BI**h
markplyer. PLYS, STOP BEING DUMB
Screaming like a chimpanzee ‘FREDDDYYY’ 😂😂
Freedddyyy you B!!!
29:17 well well well, doesn't this call back to the first games
27:55
28:38 this got me so badly lmao
It was freddy revenge
Markiplier :  FREDDY HELP ME     Freddy : no time to speak markiplier Because I need save markiplier
7:32 Moondrop was following you while you were walking, so then ig he floated at your direction and jumpscared you ._.
What do you want to do? Leave, stay, or vanny? *I want to do vanny*
Anyone gonna talk about how Freddy gave a literal child the decision to burden everything?? Like?? It s a child
Mark: FREDDYYY HELPP  Freddy: "not today supershit-"
28:43 LMFAOOOO HELP I CANT BREATHHEE
When you remember that when he says to dissasemble Vanny, youre actually "disassembling" a real person😬😬
you can save actually if you stay inside the plex you can go back to roxy raceway an collect the driver assistant head but you don't have to repair it if you collect it you can save an do all sorts of stuff
freddy: "you are my superstar" mark: **starts wheezing** me asf: **starts crying**
0:01
28:41 lol. why freddy
27:49 tis is part u wanna see
Mark: FREDDYYYYYY! Freddy: I’m fast as fuck boi **ZOOMS PAST MARK**
Man those new eyes really made freddy not recognize Gregory like dang ik he looked different to freddy but dang he past the man like at least 5 times
Freddy was like : you’re on your own, supershit ✌🏻
the starting had me.
Actually mark you picked the bad ending in the start thats why and in that ending freddy dies
Anyone started crying when freddy got dismantaled?
The betrayal ending: 28:40
27:54 FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDYYYYYY
What a buggy mess.
Go to minute 18:00 😂
“Good news… it is almost a cock” got me in tears
Markipliers reaction to the completely disjointed and nonsensical ending is just perfect.
Poopastar
27:52
“Did they run out of budget for the last animation?” Supposedly, yes.
i wish you'd turn down the OVERLY fake screaming just a bit. volume control is hard to manage like this xD
0:06
I saw the animation so I need to see it🤣27:46
27:40
Mark: "Somehow Freddy detected I had an injury while there was none" Freddy: Detecting EMOTIONAL DAMAGE
if y'all are looking for the part where monty chases mark, here: 27:43
Other youtubers when freddy and vannesa died: AYO THATS MESSED UP  Mark: uhhhhh what uhhhhh hmm
28:00
Am I the only one crying when he said "Your are my superstar." 😭😭
Yes, i litteraly cried at the « you are my superstar ».
i was gon cry and lose my cool with the whole freddy and 'you are my superstar' thing but markiplier with the wheeze and the 'did they run out of budget for the last animation?' cracked me up LMFAO
Can we just appreciate that this link has 'bruh' in it?
27:53 thats where The meme starts
80GB On steam and they can't cram in a cutscene
You are my superstar... IM FUCKING CRYING
Lol
27:00
Red Hare-ing a falllacy..
Markiplier in fnaf 3: "Freddy can come on in, have a nice tea party, THEN HE CAN GO F#@K HIMSELF!!!"  Markiplier in fnaf security breach: FREDDY DON'T WAIT YOUR TURN!"
Gregory just got a fucking human disassembled
Well that Vanny ending was incredibly bizzare.
DONT WAIT YOUR TURN FREDDY!!!! 😂
Watching this again because why not and I gotta say that I do agree there was a lot in the game and I feel as though the game could have been longer than what it is. Don't get me wrong the game does take some time to beat but at the same time it felt rushed, I mean why have this huge facility if we only go to the same 5 areas and then the game is done?  Yeah there are a ton of collectibles which I myself have only found a few and I am wanting to find  them all and I do know that there are like 7 different endings but still the question stands. They clearly went through all the trouble to make all these areas but once again we only go to like 5 areas multiple times and then we're done. Overall I enjoyed the game and I hope they expand on it like maybe add a pacifist ending where we free the animatronics without destroying them or we visit the other areas and go through through them or something like that.
most of fnaf: grinding to find secret endings security breach: choose your ending with the click of a button
ah yes, the three well known potions: stay leave *Vanny*
He sounds lika a seagull screaming for food
Misson-get to recharge station Mark-having a serious ataack
I actually slept at the last 9 minutes of the video and woke up at markiplier screaming "*FREEDDDDDYY!!*".
Ok if any one agrees with me then you have to like this comment FREDDY IS DEFINITELY GREGORYS DAD
Loved the bit at the start when Freddy won’t come to him and he just keeps shouting at Freddy.
If you are comming from the monty chase animation it starts at 27:52, your welcome
27:55 is when the best part starts
“FREDDY YOU BASTARD”😂😂😂
Lolllll 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
they ran out of budget indeed
One of those moments he rages in a HORROR game
if peter cullen ever retires from voicing optimus prime, kellen goff (glamrock freddy's va) should be his successor.
Mark: literally in panic Freddy: I don't know what you're saying. But in honesty, *I totally ditched you*
The fact that the game devs let the enemy Animatronics teleport around but not Freddy is honestly hilarious to me. Did anyone even playtest this game?
When Freddy dies, Everybody: *cries in pain* Mark: *laughs*
god I love the way mark just doesn’t accept the fact that Freddy dies “you are my superstar” “nope wrong ending let’s go again”
Freddy runs past Mark and looks at him while he is running from Monty:  I got a way to go, superstar!
27:44 best scenario ever
Markiplier: FrrEdDY! Freddy: *feddy*
11:14 what did you say?  Speak louder
28:28 leaving this here for myself
The way my soul left my body at 27:51 it made me drop my goldfish crackers 🥲
Freddy straight up running passed both Mark and Monty is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen
Faz-inating
Feddy
20:38 “thanks door”
Mark, I was hit with a Takis ad. And yet they haven’t sponsored you :(
I didn’t click the link come find me
28:02 Freddy 28:32 FREDDYY!!!
28:43 “you’re on your own, superstar”
Underwhelming
29:06 Freddy had to hit up that bathroom first.
first episode in this series where there were actual jumpscares cause of the glitches
Omg when Freddy ran past him lol
SUBTITLES “LETS BEGIN BY REMOVING DADDY’S FACE”
Nobody: Mark: I will find you >:>
Fun fact: Freddy is my sunshine he is what keeps me alive 🥺  I rlly thought vanny meant we see her face-
the way freddy ran right past him when he needed him the most is top tier comedy
Im crying the vanny ending was sad😭
Everyone talking about mark yelling about freddy. But there’s also him yelling about VANESSA lol timestamp for when it starts: 10:10
27:50 i f you want that scene
For those coming from the animation, the time when he starts getting chased by Monty is 28:00.
Vanny kinda bad bad tho 😏
if i could program a game id literally make it exactly like this with no changes
10:26 YOUR NOT SUPPOSED TO GO BACK 💀 😶
7:43 BRO your timer went out 💀 just LEAVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE YOU GET THE CHOICE TO STAY OR VANNY WHEN YOU GO TO THE EXIT
Found it 28:09
28:42 Top 10 Anime Betrayals
the link of this video literally has a "bruh" in it
28:42 when Freddy screws Markiplier over
27:52
Markiplier: "GET ME IN GET ME IN!!"  freddy: "Im sorry little one."
Bruh, roxy has wall hacks and still got wrecked by a child
What happend?????  Are you serious!!!!!! ***FreDdEeEEeYYYYyYYy***
27:50 FREDDDYYYYYY
28:39
This series has mostly revolved around Mark's trouble of navigating the Pizzaplex, and the half of this episode shows that he still has trouble navigating the Pizzaplex.
Freddy to everyone: * a father figure * Freddy to Mark: * a lost dog *
"I feel you are broken" FNAF security breach to Gregory  "You are broken, we're still your friends. Let me put you back together" FNAF 4 to the crying child  Watch game theory to understand the possible connection between between these two phrases.   Fun fact of the day: Markiplier will not respond to this comment
But like what happens if you choose to leave?????
MY FAV PART SO FAR  Mark:Okay lets just not die...yaknow thats an option
Mark:*runs into moondrop*him:"Wait what...hold on  Moondrop:It's past your bed time AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
17:20 Vanny is a animatronic to the destruction bots I guess. 27:53 Funniest Mark moment of the whole video.
This is the first time mark has ever seemed disappointed in a FNaF game.
27:53 This is where the fun begins
M: “freddy is freddy” Also M: *crys of freddys death*
27:50- The part the comedy starts
Man, the fucking map bot and security bots were scarier than the characters that were supposed to be the main threats 💀
How it works and has always worked is he goes to where you were when you summoned him, he doesn’t just come to you where you move next. But you aren’t very observant.
27:53 Pure Comedy
Mark: *constantly spams the Freddy summon button* Also Mark: *gets pissed when Freddy won't stay in one spot*
28:42 a a a a a aaaaa
✨✨✨✨
For anyone that wants to skip to the infamous FREDDY part: 27:50 :) enjoy
27:53 This chase was hilarious
Gosh
27:54
To be honest, the vanny ending is probably the worst ending possible. The second best ending would probably be leaving because of the cute scenes we get of Gregory and Freddie and the best ending is definitely staying. Just because you get way more gameplay and it isn’t just a slideshow of pictures.
For anyone looking for THAT moment: 27:52
Freddy gave no fucks
28:42 that was hilarious how he went straight past him
10:42 bro the coding in this game is whack
27:55
5:04 steelwool isnt the best at making games
28:14 funniest moment in this entire video HAHAH FREDDY YOU B*TCH!
Mark, I Think Freddy Only Gets Called To The Spot That You Call Him At.. Not The Spot Where Your Character Is...So When You Tried Calling Freddy To Be Safe From Monty, He Was Running To The Spot Where You Called Him... 28:42
17:11 is probably what you're looking for
idky im watching this to SLEEP but the ending sequence woke me up with laughter
28:30 I CAN'T😭😭😭😭😭
17:58 Mark's teapot
That comic book style ending was sad with freddy
Why are you choe Vanny!!!!!!
The Fun begins. At 27:50 😂
28:37 markiplier: FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY. Freddy: hold on I need to do something and I’m tired
28:41 is just the best
Freddy!! FReADyY
good news! it is almost a cock
Mark: At least now I can see everything *walks past a glowing present in Freddy*
That screaming make me remember the meme Meme name : freddy ignores gregory 😂😂😂
NOT FREDDY waiting his turn down the stairs LMAO
28:17-28:39 both of these are pure gold
28:00 Freddy's betrayal
27:54 Chaos starts here.
The fnaf king is facing a challenge so annoying it might just make him insane  Glitches
28:02 I LOVE THIS MOMENT
7:30 28:42
LITERALLY HOW DID MARK NOT CRY AT “you..are my superstar…”
Vanny kinda bad tho...
The charging stations are disconnected right now. Mark: panicking because he can’t ge tin a charging station.
17:57. Markiplier at this point sounds like an old truck breaking down
the word "bruh" is in the video url.
28:30
7:30 What happened
I haven’t laughed that hard in awhile 😂 at 27:55 to 29:00 him screaming for Freddy and Freddy running past him and then letting Monty go first was hilarious!  I think I watched that one scene a dozen times. Wow I needed a good laugh..thank you Mark for being you
17:39 im crying just bc of this scene
27:53 - 29:24 was funni
not 2 be Dramatic but the Part where vanny tortures freddy made me genuinely upset i started shedding tears LMFAOO i js love him sm 😞Like???????? his eyes when he got thrown LMAO
28:43 looked like Freddy went up there to kick Monty’s ass😂
All of the recharging stations get disabled once roxy’s eyes are fitted, but mark did not know that because he is stupid
Yea mark is correct on that part as much as I love the five nights series this entry was very out of place in my opinion. Not that it was bad in fact quite the opposite there are some incredibly terrifying moments in this game. But there are other moments where it’s not scary at all and just out of place. But unlike most unpolished games there is an explanation. Sooooooo many things happened while it was under development Covid,Scott’s retirement, Scott basically getting lit up by the fan base, and it being rushed at the end so you have to take this game with a grain of salt as so much happend
28:54 Hey manners are important when you're a man-eating robot >:(
“FREEEEEEEDDDDAAAAAAAYYYYYY”  I’m dying PLEASE-
I just heard my 3 year old yell from the living room “ Freddy” after mark had yelled Freddy’s name 😂😂😂
There was meant to be a bowling game for Bonnie bowl and a golf game for monty's golf but they scaped that idea for some reason.
28:43 pure comedy
28:44
28:44 This is probably the highest I’ve heard of Markiplier yell in 2021 and it’s hilarious.
The ending made me cry because Freddy died
Omg the ending was so sad my heart was breaking😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😟poor freddy
28:04 Freddy: Monty i know you can get Gregory come on get him NOW! Mark: Freddy Freddy!! Plss  Freddy: "troll face" Gregory! I can't help you now you need to the vent! Mark: NO! NO! NO! Like this!! Freddy FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!! YOU *******!!! Freddy: "see Gregory die"
hi
,,Are you serious rn? 🙃”
What happens if we live
All I know is Freddy run to the position that player called him
Good news! It's almost a COCK  -Freddy, Security breach, 2021
The fact that Vanny, the main villain of the game, gets so little screentime and then a joke ending is a travesty. They need to get to work on a real Vanny game fucking immediately.
this video's url has bruh innit
The intro Good news it is almost a chicken
Actually you can ran into staff bot if you running out of energy. You will get a i frame and regenerate your energy without worrying about getting caught
27:50
*Freddy dies* Mark: Jim Carey grinch laugh
The outro makes it look like the S.T.A.F.F Bots are having a rave; And, I love it.
When you have gum in class: 15:28
"...did they run outta budget for the last animation?" trust me mark, we all felt that  like what the fuck kind of pacing was that
27:54 when he get arlerted
last episode “yeah the charging stations won’t be available” mark this episode: “WHY ARENT THE CHARGING STATIONS AVAILABLE?????!!!!!!????”
I would have been so annoyed at freddy's AI at the end hahaha
He sad ending makes me cry everytime
20:34 he wanted Gregory to leave for his safety but also wanted him to stay. He even have a party pass incase Gregory decides to stay
Damn, vanny kinda thic 🥴
Freddy: Fuck This Shit I'm Out 28:42
14:44 Freddy looks so sad he looks like he doesn't want Gregory to leave YET
Fast Freddy Eye Upgrade. Ready? Set? GO! 0:03 😂
Hey Mark,do you mind if I mark some pliers
LMFAO WHEN FREDDY WALKED PAST HIM HAHHDEFHER
If you are watching, the jumpscares are at 3:34, 7:29, 10:46, 12:23, and 29:14. Tell me if I missed any. You're welcome.
FREDDAYYYYYY!!! Freddddy!!!!   FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!
Giving the Wet floor signs souns like that is friggin sweet. :)
Actually what was happening with Freddy was every time you gave him a move command he would go to that spot. He will not accept another move command until he gets to that spot. He also teleports less and will often come from where he was last left if it is in render distance.
Freddddddyyyyy you bi*** freddddyyyyy That was hilarious comedy bruh   Freddy: sorry dealing malfunctioning  😂😂😂😂😂
28:40    I’m dead 😂😂😂
28:41 HAHAHA I CAN'T AHAHAHAH
Gregory: "FREDDY!!!" Freddy: "WWWRY" Freddy: "You are my superstar."
11:38 i think Mark is broke
10:21 Mark: Vanessa Me: what Mark: VAANESSA Me: What? Mark:VANESSA! Me: WHY TF ARE YOU SAYING MY- oh NVM... vanny...imma dunce dunce dunce😤🤣
Freddy new eyes gave him better battery makes sense
mark: what happen? what happen? what happen?
SOME ONE GER STEVE ERWIN TO TAKE MONTY LIKE JESUS CHRIST HE SCARES THE LIVING DAYLIGHT OUT OF ME
I was having an emotional breakdown because of what happened to roxy then the intro bruh 💀
game is way too buggy
freddy kinda looks like Ironman
Pffff You will find me? You can't even find the Exit.
everyone thinks gregory is the best and  bravest mc in fnaf but i KNOW he would get his ass folded by foxy. let alone springtrap, these animatronics in this game are nice yeah but they are like. mickey mouse compared to the other games, still. im looking forward to the other fnaf games that might come out
28:36 FREEEEDDDY!!!!
28:38 XD
Freddy 😭😭😭😭
S
So frustrating to see Mark get pissed at Freddy when he's functioning the way he's supposed to, Mark just never figured out that when you call him he comes to the location where you first called him. If Mark had simply *stopped hitting the call button* he would have been fine
Mark: the gulf? Me: THE GULF OF MEXICO!
28:02 is the part almost everyone is looking for.
27:08 Mark, how did you not recognize the name of the game you were reading about? BB World was WAY back in FNAF 3 when you used that minigame, along with many others, to get the secret ending that just said "The End" instead of the "Bad Ending" for FNAF 3. That was such an amazing easter egg that I can't believe you missed! XD
Freddy "I'll lose power in less than an hour" Bruh you'll lose power un less than 5 minutes 😂
“FREDDY YOU BITCH!!” Lmao
Mark - “What happened?”  Mark a second later - “What happened was the moon man got me.”  Me: no mark, you ran out of time
Titanfall much?
Freddy " don't worry superstar I will keep you safe" Mark " FREEDDYY"
I rlly hope that they eventually fix all the game issues and add the gameplay bc I see the vision n it is immaculate but the buggy stuff n lack of stuff is rlly prevalent
28:38 freddy troll moments
Freddy: Yeah let's stop Vanny once and for all!  (Next Scene) Fucking dies.
I’m wheezing so hard rn it hurts 🤣 Freddy running away from Mark when he needed him most 😂
who wanna tell mark that you need to let freddy fucking get to you one location request at a time he cant just stop 😭😭
I love how mark missed that Freddy said the recharge station are out of order for now XD
I love this series
So like... Vanny and the higher-ups are kidnapping children to sell in the sex-trade to the pedophile elites?
28:46, just a timestamp if y'all want to lose lung privileges.
mark running away from monty frantically while summoning freddy for help was the most hilarious thing.
Markiplier when he sees gift boxes in the spotlight: it's a trap  Markiplier when there is an actual trap: sure ok
looks like freddy follows your path when you call him. until a certain amount of distance then he just teleports to you
I laughed so badly that I cried like the map bot the frrrreeeeeeddddyyyyyyy and just so much that was funny XD
NOOOO.. 17:50...who else cried  FREDDYYY
FREEEEEEEEDAAAAAAAY
10:45 scare soo much even though my resolution changed
Am I the only one who thinks of fnaf 2 animation when he yells Freddy?
Freddy: I am coming, I am here, *sees Monty* I am leaving
bruh press the button at the main stage lol
Alright hol up. If Vanny is actually Vanessa in a bunny suit, then does that mean the robots ripped out her organs and intestins as blood and her body parts and flesh splat all over the place and thats why they didnt show it? I see
28:37 lmao
28:37
Dude ur mad loud chill
That was so cap. Freddy should solo the guards
Will he ever realized that freddy goes where he click the button first and not where he is
28:02 for those people who came from the meme
we went from demon anamtronics to freddy being being a dad to gregory and helping him what has fnaf come to and why did i cry watching him die 😂😂
Mark sounds like freddy
Markiplier - “Freddy!!!!!”  Freddy running past mark -  “Go Fuck yourself SuperStar”
Mark, everything makes sense if you delve into the lore and the universe. You're looking at it as a standalone game and that's why you're seeing so many holes in the plot
28:40 you really have to think that the devs weren't using their brain when creating the mechanics for this game. really this is such a sad way to show your game
18:00 imagine doing a black ops 4 and turning an ending into a fucking comic. holy shit thats actually stupid.
PLS click, you won't regret, belive me xdd ---> 28:42
Just wondering... When you ask for Freddy. Does he run to you or to the location you are looking at?
What happened was you got the bad ending there’s also good endings and bad eggs
This game sucks🤣🤣
these are so much fun to watch istg
At 28:40 it just get hilarious
At 27:53 I got scared and threw my phone 😂
Hello SuperStar! I loved your video, Go on SuperStar!
Can sombody help me i cant chose vanny
-Gregory, you can leave now, but you can stay and we can investigate the pizzaplez. -Vanny. -Gregory... Superstar...... What the fuck is wrong with you?
Freddy: good news its almost a 🐓 Me: *dies from laughing*
If Roxy could see through walls why hasn't she been chasing you down all game?
ur fuckn awesome <3 <3
11:40 idk guys i think he might be serious 🧐
28:16
This is what happens when Scott doesn't stay to help finalize a game, we get a buggy lmao, unless he did and just not all bugs were tested
28:42  freddy running away from mark is the most hilarious thing ever
I don't think it was the budget, but more of Scott cawthorn being pretty muched kicked out his creation, he was only there for half of the games development if I remember it correctly, so the visions wasn't fully realized
Mark, my guy, there's MULITIPLE ENDINGS (6 to be exact)
Much to Mark’s ending point: how buggy that if you get caught by a security bot, Roxy, Monty, or Chica can literally teleport to you for capture and kill. But if you call to Freddy, he has to run to you normally and can’t just teleport.
Literally all of Marks gameplay the people who made security breach need to fix it
I think I heard of a secret ending. *I think something about a fire exit and golden plushies.* Idk tho my friend told me
WHY WHOLD THEY KILL FREDDY
13:54 “I will miss you.”
Mark: I'm gonna go to a charging station! Me: but it said they're off and can't protect you...way back at the beginning of the video...
27:52 to 29:23 is the funniest part of this 🤣
I'll find you too
you shouldve put the gamma in a higher level it was advised by a gamer-
The Freddie A.I. is fucking infuriating when you're trying to call him.   "THESE EYES ARE SO GOOD I CAN SEE EVERYTHING EXCEPT WHERE THE ONLY FUCKING CHILD IN THE BUILDING IS LOCATED."
21:05
1/18/2022 6:00
The game was a lot more ambitious. This was how it was always supposed to be, but they ran out of time to implement everything. Places like Bonnie Bowl, Roxy's Salon, and Chica's Bakery were gonna have more to do and more of a reason to exist, not to mention the arcade games they wanted to make playable. I think they're gonna implement this stuff after the bugfixes.
I didn’t know Mark could scream that high pitched 🤣🤣🤣 I may have missed it but didn’t he run by a ton of hiding spots???
The crying child trying to explain why he’s crying: 17:57
Have you forgotten you can hide?
Wow this game is Janky as fuck. It's good but... The comic ending is D A M N and it just doesn't feel polished
Vanny wants to kill you
i wondered why there was so much stuff in game... clearly things were taken out. but maybe they will bring them back in DLC
me and Mark both got the worst ending
Vanessa was sus from the beggining being the only humanoid guard in the whole frickin pizzaplex
3:32 I'M CRYING WHY DID MOON RUN AT HIM LIKE THAT CJSDBIFU
markiplier died inside at the end   markiplier: WHEEZE
I'm pretty sure this game got not only you, but all of us brain damaged
No one’s gonna see this but the way you summon the MULE in DRG is by placing a post that it goes to despite where you are and that’s what Freddy is doing basically
I'm with Mark. All those ending cutscenes were so abrupt, and the stylistic change was so jarring I couldn't take it seriously when Freddy busted out that superstar line.
Monty is probably the scariest out of the whole band gang. His stomping is even louder than Freddy's and he's a lot louder and heavier.
17:50 I'm having an aneurysm this is like something straight outta fan fiction what the hell even is this game???
THAT ENDING WITH FREDDY WAS THE BEST
Ingay no tol continue kanalang mag laro
fav part is 28:04:> t lyrics are all the same words let me say them for you. "FREDDY YOU DUMB BI- BASTARD FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY GET YOUR ASS HERE. thank you for wasting your time by watching this :>
Markibrain. There are multiple endings so the Vanny ending which involves the death of Freddy is an ending
Why does part 8 have more views than part 7? People are evil.
No one: Freddy: go little rockstar 🥰
Me: leaning on my chair back and forth yk casually Video: **Intense jumpscare that scares the absolute CRAP out of me** Me: **screaming and I fall all the way back to my death on the ground**
me totally not forgetting that this isn't a heist with Markiplier and looking at the end for an ending bc idk if this is the last episode ;)
Why is it that when Greg gets inside Freddy’s chest and out it reminds me of Subnautica
so i take it we missed like super important plot points and vanny is just a thing now. okay! Sure 10/10 lore design a guess
17:57 This will eventually be a meme
Freddy: You are... my superstar  Mark: *confused stroke noises*
“Or you can continue to explore the secrets of the pizzaplex” says Freddy in the most enthusiastic voice
29:16 😂😂😂
Freddy reminds me of octumius prime i have no clue how to spell his name lol
Do you wanna stay?  VANNY!
Ya want too.....Vanny? 😆
Freddy walking behind Monty on the stairs reminded me of a Mr.Bean episode when he was tryna get passed the old lady on the stairs and then got stuck between two old ppl🤣🤣  Also note: Mark woulda survived if he was so impatient on Freddy and busy to wanna see where he at😂😂 like he knws where you at man, just chill🤣
Thanks for showing me the game play I can’t play it
When Freddy ran up the stairs, I thought he was finna fight Monty🤣  Mark: "Freddy dont wait your turn goddamnit!!!"😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣
Ngl vanny is like a butterface character. No weird simp shvt, but she got a good body, no?😂😂
First Stage of Grief: Denial
*am moment that is supposed to be sad*   Mark: 💀*laughs*
If you call Freddy and walk a mile away, Freddy shows up exactly where you pressed the button to call him the first time, before you decided to move. Its kinda obvious lol
"FREDDEEEEY YOU BASTARD!"  That just came from the heart lol
This game is a buggy mess, but the voice acting, especially Freddy's, is really solid.
Freddy Fucking Dies at Five Nights At Freddy’s
Mark: **having external panic attacks and making sure he’s known** Freddy: **sipping tea** I’ll be there in a second, go on without me!
27:57 Or 28:02?
28:40 was just too funny! I started laughing so much!!! FREDDDDYYYYY
***Possible Spoiler/Watch full video or past **14:00*****     I honestly can't get over the horrible mechanic of not allowing you to save after you decide to Stay/Go to Vanny at the end. That move I feel like would eliminate casual gamers from enjoying the full game because it essentially becomes hardcore mode. Sure, fun challenge for some, but with the amount of bugs in this makes the game that much more difficult. Correct me if I'm wrong if it changes later because I'm still binging Marks videos. But yeah, not sure why someone thought that was a good idea :/
ITS ALMOST A WHAT? Freddy there is Gregory do not say such foul launguage
15:30 is this for real? forced cutscenes? guns in a horror game? limited saving oppurtunities inbatween annoying or tedius tasks? story choices in a open world game? a barely usable map? and this cutsene at the timestamp, this literly cant be for real. it reminds me of gmod SFM animatsions where ragdolls go insane. the bot quards jumpscare is starving at you, and it stuns you. i would rather play unity games off of itch io then this, and they are free.
27:40 and onwards, that happens to me a lot. Freddy frustrates me so much sometimes 😂😂
Freddy to Jacksepticeye: a father figure  Freddy to Markiplier: a lost/confused child
Ok but the recent tiktok trend "go, little rockstar♡" and now Freddy's "you got this, superstar!☆" make me emotional :')
OH!! MY GODDD!! DID HE RELY SAY YOU'RE MY SUPERSTAR BEFORE DYING I HATE THIS GAME😭
Mark is the best at repeating himself lol
Sad ending🥺😭😢😥 Also the part Freddy runs past Mark🤣
FREDAAAGAAAAGGGAAAGGAGADY
It ends with stars
Not clicking on the link  so mark can come and find me  Do it I DARE you !
Hey fredster
This whole series is Mark constantly ignoring information right in front of him and 10 minutes later freaking out because he has no idea what he’s doing
Voice: recharge stations are offline Mark: tries a recharge station
i would have much more preferred freddy saying “i am michael afton” instead of “you are my superstar”
28:39 I CAN'T BREATHE THE WAY HE JUST WALKED PASSED HIM I CANNNTTTTT😭😭😭😭😭
28:00
I love how Mark yells to Freddy
You can’t and won’t find me Mark
0:07
How did you download it?
I wonder how much their electric bill is ngl
21:33 he sounds like Mickey Mouse it made me chuckle
i think twitter went on a fucking shit storm and made the creator have to retire because he backed trump.  so while trying to deal with the game they had to deal with cancel culture
28:42 Freddy: Ahora no Gregory, necesito salvar a Gregory 🏃 La musica de fondo de la guerderia: 😃  Muy pero muy pero muy probablemente sea la unica en los comentarios que habla español
5:13 I love how Freddy runs into Roxy's room after being summoned 😂😂😂
"fnaf is a scary game what do you mean you cried" Freddy: you are... my superstar me: *sobbing*
I think Security Breach is the best and worst FNAF game. The best being Markiplier’s playthrough of the game and the worst being the state of the game it came out in.
Use the remote and disable all the communists
Monty chasing Mark: Mark: FREDEYYY LET ME IN!!! Freddy: Your on your own bye bitch
The main stage prize might not have been added yet
FAEDDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I died so many times haha
freddy was like LMAO GOOD LUCK SUPERSHIT and ran past mark
Me *balling cause Freddy died*   Markipleir*lauging*
Markiplier reaction to Monty chasing him reminds me of shia labeouf being chased and calling out to Bumblebee in the Transformer movie or pilots in TitanFall.
Oh my god. I wish he would stop screaming like an idiot…
STOP - PRESSING - THE CALL BUTTON
18:07 - Exactly my thought... - This game seems rushed for some reason, and I feel the reason might be Scott Cawthon's passion for the franchise and videogame-development, considering the controversy that happened and all that he was attacked for on a personal level. - He didn't retire for nothing and he seemed to quickly wrap up development for this game. Cause budget can't be an issue when you have millions in the bank.
Late comment, but I think Mark really need to stop frickin' calling Freddy, becayse what I think happens is that every time you give the signal, the AI just resets searching for another path. I bet that if Mark had just stood there and called once, he'd have had Freddy there within 30 seconds. - But no, Mark is impatient and self-sabotages.
Markplier:runs from monty trying to get freddy* me: :0000;mark: Freddy you bitch!?!?!?!? ;me; w͟h͟e͟e͟z͟e͟*
3:32 "yeah so..the animatronics do get a bit quirky at night."
I hate this new trend in video games of having to hold a keyboard button (like on a controller) for an ABSURD amount of time just to skip a piece of text or w/e.  This game takes it to the extreme, not a fan of bad game design. Also Freddy running past him when he needed him most was hilarious
FREDDY FREDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYY WHERE ARE YOU NO WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN FREDDY
I didnt realize that until you said it when you could stay leave or vanny
mark running for his life begging for freddy freddy: HEHE ROSEY CARPETS ON STAIR HEHEH
The game isnt fully released, its not even a finished game. So ive heard. There are things from the trailers that havent been cleared up. I think the couple of endings that are comic looking are fillers, cause its not done.
Those "killer robots" were actually quite disturbing.
Him forgetting all the instructions is painful
Doesnt Chicas voice thing allow freddy to stun animatronics so why didn't he use it all love great vid
Sometimes I want to scream at mark to do what he has to do instead of trying to do the opposite and die multiple times💀
Mark wanted that reward
Freddy: *Dies* Markiplier: _HAHAHAHAHAHAHA_ *wheezing*
There are 5 endings
FREDYYYYYYYYYYYY FREDYYYYYYYYY FREDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
28:00 this was so entertaining
Can I have a hug after you find me? Today was a bit of a bad mental health day.
He's played this for how many hours now and hasn't figured out that wherever you are when you click the summon Freddy button, he goes to that spot? Lol
mark: wha- wha- what     While me: what whaaaaaaaa- what
28:42
28:02 *"FREDDYYY!"*
bet freddy is a boss at the end
ending so bad mark laughed when the companion character died
Didn't you just spend two episodes making fun of people for enjoying Cawthon's meta-mystery building?
is it just me or are you wondering how helpy survived from fnaf six in harmed
29:20 - Ahhhh I love fnaf comedy~
the sudden comic instead of a cutscene trying to be emotional when it just looks like they had no more in the budget 😂 that ending was garbage
Mark: *drowns* FREDDYYYY *drowns again* FREDDYY
mark not catching the charging station warning and trying to still charge several times then audibly making it known he's going to the recharge station cus he thinks that's how a problem is solved is peak mark "we don't need tturiels"
i didn't understand shit, the first endind mark got was so fucking stupid, why was the final cutscene a comic? and why did it close everything so abruptly?????????
Markiplier: FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY F R EEEEE D D D YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY Monty: Hey! Little Guy! Freddy: Way to go, superstar!
I think it’s been established that Sony rushed the production of this game because they wanted to use it as a selling point for the PS5 thus causing the very buggy and half baked product we got. Still fun though.
11:34 me in any social situation when people are being sarcastic
28:03
When you said *I will find you* at the end I was playing fnaf and Monty said in the same time as you
Mark pov: freddy "no" Fredey "perfect"
Mark when Freddy "dies": whaWhaWHaWHAWHWHAWAHWHY
The first ending with the Vanny choice sucked cuz it didn’t even tell us if Vanny was Vanessa or anything. It didn’t tell us anything about the plot.
aaaaaaaaa
top 10 anime betrayals: 28:42
The edit of Freddy saying, "It's almost a *cluck* " got me so bad 😂
Mark, furiously spamming "summon Freddy" as he runs around, meaning that Freddy is likely going to go to each location he has been summoned to: WHY IS FREDDY NOT COMING!?!
11:54 he made my Siri pop up lol
Moon has gave me multiple heart attacks. I want sun back.
20:51 "Okay so the party pass will get me into the.... Whatamahozed" I was laughing so hard at his made up word 😆
you know how the staff bot was supposedly doing stand-up comedy? Well the real comedy was when Freddie walked past Gregory/Mark when he needed him.
I want a sound clip of Gregory yelling "Freddy!  You Bastard!!"
Mark died when he he got the Vanny ending
i actually started crying when Freddy got disassembled
Mark: I think Vanny is a Red Herring  Me: *mind automatically jumps to Glitch trap*
28:40 Easly the best part of the entire series.
Laughing soo hard at the end it was like markiplayer yelling FREDDIIYYYYY
The Fact that Freddy Left Markiplier for Dead at 28:01 is Hilarious/Horrible, ngl-
The fact I’ve been shouting the way to the main atrium to him knowing he can’t hear me was hard
28:44 markiplier literally swearing
"gregory, your my superstar"              AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO CRIED AT THIS PART-
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Moon: bad children must be punished >:) Mark: no they don't, you don't know that☺️
Freddy: you are my super star  My mind: is he old 💀
15:21 She Got A Good Arch There Ngl
Freddy: You- are my superstar- *dies* Mark: Barely cares Me: Bleaching out the tears that won't stop rolling down my cheek
This game is honestly pretty bad. It could have used a couple more months of quality assurance, and debugging…
Wow they really cut corners for the endings of this game … everything else was so promising and then such a disappointment
17:46  SQUID GAMES ❗❗
Freddy running from Monty lmao 😂
I believe the reason why the game has those moments where it doesn't make a lot of sense is because the game was rushed at the end with everyone wanting it to come out sooner. If we just waited there was a lot of cool stuff that would've been in the game that the developers told people about.
27:55 the fun begins
I wish mark would have streamed so we could tell him that he can’t spam Freddy to help 😭  if you move after calling him he will go to the place you called not were you moved.
Mark: FREDDY COME HERE GOD DAMN IT Freddy: Hold on I saw a bug
That last Vanny cutscene perfectly captures the entire game.
It is Called 5 nights at Freddy’s
The entire start I was yelling LOADING BAY IS BEHIND YOU
Kind of a pet peeve of these videos: Mark talks when crucial info is being provided.  In other words Mark, when they talk, hold your mouth for a bit to grab the information then you can talk.  Otherwise you would know that the recharge stations are no longer available at that point of the level.
Can't wait for the animated version of this gameplay episodes
27:50
Mark: get these claw upgrades Me: haha. Clupgrades. Mark: Clupgrades
The end 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love FNAF and these new chachters ( besides Vanny and Vanessa)  but this game is not worth $40 bucks... It's seems really unfinished and rushed, sadly.  I know I won't be buying it anytime soon if at all.  Thank you Mark, for playing this and saving me money.
*me*: crying because of freddy dying *mark*: laughing and getting confused
I wonder if his room is even soundproof with the amount of screaming he does
I just accidentally reported the video
Bruh at 22:12 is the First Time in a very very long time since Markiplier has sworn before, I mean he's been Censoring himself of Cursing Lately though-
I swear there was an Exit in the Docking Area though-
has anyone ever told you that you sound like serj tankian
DAMN THEY FUCKED FREDDY
Freddy when monty is chasong mark : go die : mark when running from monty :AAAA FREDDYYYY andbhe dies
squid games
The way Mark just guesses at where to go when the game gives him a map is just absolutely fucking with me.
Freddy running past mark was just too much lmfao
"It led me down a path of pain and despair" is when I knew he picked the Vanny ending
freddy sik of markipliers bs and deides to take his sweet time while markiplier is screaming like that one kid who pisses his bed with light on and cries with lights off LMAO
Robot voice: “lets begin by removing Freddy’s face” Captions: “let’s begin by removing daddy’s face”
Mark this whole episode: F R E D D Y!!!! Freddy: 👁👄👁
Mark laughing when Freddy goes bleh made me die lol
That Vanny ending was the lamest, most cringe thing I've ever seen
I cried when freees got disassembled😭😭
What was the plan a mission
28:54 FREDDY DONT WAIT YOU TURN 28:03 FREDDY NOW FREDDY 28:21 FREEEEEEDDDYYYY 28:31 FREEDDYYYYYYY 28:43 FREDDY YOU BI*CH FREEDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Moon just flying towards him as soon as he gets out of freddy. Hilarious
Play all three princess quest games and it’ll turn vanny back into Vanessa and you can escape with her and freddy
Does freddy go to your position, or where you're looking? XD If its where you're looking, theres no wonder Freddy keeps acting up. Dude cant figure out how to run into the sky & 10 miles away from marks location lmao
Sucks that this game was rushed
28:02
Yoooo Security Breach in a nutshell 28:23 - 28:47
dang, I checked a video like right RIGHT when you decided to go on the main stage
GREOGRY!
XDDDDDDDDDDD
mark has zero common sense in absolute in shock
Not me actually crying bc Freddy "died"
FREDDY FREDDY!!!!!!! FREDDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
no one’s going to talk abt the beginning?💀💀
29:14
the end of this episode really makes me laugh
Game: the charging stations are offline and can't protect you Markiplier: you serious x15450  how many times do ya'll think he dismissed that popup without reading it again.
This game is both wonderful and terrible the same time.
OMGGGG WAIT WAIT WAIT THE LOREEEEEEE IN MEMORY OF MIKE HOFFMAN  THE CHILD WHO DISAPPEARED IN THE SILVER EYES WAS MICHAEL EVERYTHING GOES BLURRY WHEN VANNY IS AROUND VANNY IS ONE OF THE TWISTED ONES MY BRAIN MAY BE DUMB, BUT THINK ABOUT IT
No other jumpscare compares to that damn map bot for real. I shat myself every single time that bastard asked if Mark wanted a map!!!!
Mark: FREDDDDDYYYYYY  Me with earphones on: rIp eArS 😭
Mark you forgot the storm gate to break with montys claws ìn the Fazerblast area u gotta do all the little things
18:00 I cried wtf
Why is the daycare terrifying but every other time moon man comes it’s not scary?
Freddy: peace was never an option
But the docks… are an exit
Nothing is open bc it’s after hours lol silly mark 💖💖💗
8:33
the way Freddy runed past Mark got me Dying on the floor😂💀
Im sorry if i didnt catch it but.... Did He got montys claws?
I love Mark's reaction to Freddy letting Monty go down the stairs before him, it was funny as heck.
Intro: You screaming "FREDDY FREDDY, NO WRONG WAY FREDDY"
Dang it mark 7 parts and you had to choose my least favorite ending
“Not now Gregory. I have to save Gregory.” -Freddy’s reasons
vanny
28:00
10:40 my phone literally flew out of my hands
Mark screaming for Freddy ... hilarious 😂 Mark: FREEEEDDDYYY!!!!! Freddy: lost somewhere
23:11
Madness starts at 27:52 your welcome because it only gets funnier from there.
I have never seen Mark so lost in a game lol
Battery charger
If you're going to start a business maybe don't make evil robots that goes for everybody except for me I'm making an evil robot
FREDDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY
Will you laugh at that Markiplier calling for Freddy and calls him a something else and you fall off the sofa laughing
28:30 FREDDY RUNNING PAST MARK WAS SO FUNNY I WAS LITERALLY CRYING LAUGHTER TEARS
Anybody else catch at 22:34 that was a sister location doll???
Ooh! Sunny needed more screen time! We can have him run the movie theater!
Mark will find us like he did the door in the laundry room, lmao
Freddy: you.. are.. my superstar.. *dies* Mark: *wheezing* “it’s the ending?!”
Freddy: you got this superstar! Mark: *getting chased by an really ugly alligator* FREDDYYYY OVER HERERE AGAHHHGGGHGHHHHH
Freddy trying to get past Monty on the stairs: I’ll wait my turn then🧸  Mark: FREDDYYYYYYY
WTF was that ending with Vanny and the quick cut scene!!! 😭 You’re not joking 😭 That was terrible 😭
Markiplier there are more endings to five nights at Freddy's security breach
“It will never be safe”?!?!?! Bruh. He’s realized a lot since he passed out on stage.
I just keep hearing “You LIED TO ME” echoed in Danny’s impression of his teacher from an old Sonic(?) episode of Game Grumps. That someone could sound remotely close to that is equally as scary as this game—not to bad, but sometimes it just gets to you
Tbh the abrupt cutscenes were weird enough as it is. But why the comic book style sub-endings. Why only give the true ending a short animation? It's something that truly bothered me since a comic book style ending especially when it's supposed to portray a sad event like that just feels...off, I mean there was no context and all of the sudden "oh let's kill freddy". Such weird pacing. Maybe because of the whole "superstar" thing they thought that a comic book style ending would fit but...it just feels rather odd. If the cutscenes would announce themselves a bit better and if they would have just taken the time to animate everything and also give a hint towards what the true ending is for the fandom to figure out, in my opinion it would've worked better.
thats what happens when budget runs out?
*Freddy ran past.* Mark: "FREDDY! FREDDY! YOU BI*CH! FREDDY!!!  Freddy: "Imma go beat him up! :D"  That's what I always see that and I couldn't stop laughing. X3 28:43
I lost my mind watching freddy run in circles around mark and monty
>something may have gone wrong in delevopment Yeah, Scott left.
Mark: Freddy!, Freddy! Freddy: runs as fast a he could  Mark: FREDDY FREDDY
28:39 Your welcome.
Haha Freddy runs past haha oh my I was sweating lol and bastard so he runs past lol hilarious 😂🤣🖕🤣😳😳😳🖕🖕😂🤣😂🤣
27:52 that scared me i spilled my soda
no one talking abt mark literally going  "van-essa Vanessa" in such an annoyed way
"Good news! It is almost a cock."
Freddy didn't want to deal with monty
game seems so buggy
28:44 to 28:49 was so funny
what is this game
Please there are so much more endings. Like 6 endings, so the one that you did was an ending but not the canon one
Spoilers      Freddy: you’re… my s… superstar… *dies* Mark: _wheezes_
nooooooo freddy !!
Jesus what a genuinely poorly designed game
28:40 my guy got so scared/excited/annoyed he turned into jacksepticeye lmao
Vanny is a ghost
14:27 +do you wanna stay?  - Vaaaaaaaaaanny  +Gregory what? what are you saying- -VAAAAAAAAAANNNYYY
the first half of this vid felt like a fever dream
Can you do the ending where you leave
Mark soeed running the end. No idea what’s going on.
Mark: *F R E D D Y ! ! !* Freddy: "On your left--"🏃💨
When he said your my superstar I kinda cried
28:40 is the funniest thing i have ever heard
Mark continuously not listening to instructions is part of the entertainment
15:26 lol
you got the vanny endings before getting the first ending your ament to get
17:59 lmao he sounds like a broken squeaky toy
BISH COME FIND ME. I DARE YOU. I *TRIPLE* DOG DARE YOU.
never thought id be hearing mark yelling at freddy fazbear for not having his back in conflict
While Freddy running past a panicked Mark is hilarious, the one detail that stuck out to me was Vanessa. When she was talking about the doors being open, you can hear the shift in her voice from stern, exhausted security guard to childish, brainwashed sociopath. It was such an eerie shift, but it was executed _so_ well. I honestly commend her VA.
Mark: Remembers the company meeting is at 11:30pm on Thursday Also Mark: Can’t remember where to go seconds after being told
JUMPSCARE TIMESTAMPS - made by flying potatoe :) 3:33 Moon 7:28 Moon 10:45 Moon 12:23 Moon 27:52 Bot 28:26 Bot 29:13 Monty
28:02 that was really funny
There's just something different about Mark yelling "Freddy, you bastard!" when it is not Freddy in the jump scare XD
27:57 28:02 28:20 28:54 29:14
_THE END_
I wonder what Amy and mark’s neighbours were thinking when Mark was screaming for Freddy. 🤣
11:11
I can't decide if I should keep crying over Freddy's dead in the bad end, or just keep laughing my ass off at Freddy's running past Mark and leaving him behind... I'll just ask to the wise closed-talking-door of Freddy's Pizzaplex
Freddy running straight past him on the stairs had me in fucking TEARS
23:39 THE FUCKING SOUUNNDD BROOOO
Mark: *calls freddy*  Freddy: "where Gregory*
FREDDAY
You should cosplay as freddy
Mark getting lost and trying to run paths in his head, when he has an entire map is truly peak YouTube
Freddy: watching mark in the elevator contemplating on what the hell is going on while slowly losing his mind
Markiplier's neighbors: Is he ok? 😳
IMMM CRYYYYYNNGGG THE PART 28:40 WAS THE BEST PART OMMMMGG
i havent clicked any link and i so no mark near me house
28:45 marks voice really went 📈📈📈
Game: Offers Mark to stay or leave, or he could possibly Vanny. *chooses Vanny* Game: *immediately kills Freddy*
I really hope Lixian animates some of this playthrough like he usually does (particularly the part where Mark is literally screaming for Freddy to save him and Freddy's just like 'must've been the wind' lol 😂)
What’s with the end 🤣
Freddy constantly running all around the establishment or right past Mark had me wheezing
areyouseriousareyouseriousareyouseriousareyouseriousareyouseriousareyouserious I love this series sm 😭😭
28:03 this part that mark needs help from Freddy but he didn’t listen to him 😂😂😂😂
freddy running past both mark and monty while they just stare/scream for him is comedy gold
the first 5 seconds shad me dead LOL
15:00 this game literally said 'we ran out of money and need to ship for xmas' huh
28:35 "Freddaaaaayyyy you BITCH"
Good news it’s almost a  r🐓
Dunno who figured this out already, but Freddy’s AI works like this:  When Gregory calls him, Freddy will run to the last spot you called him at, like it’s a tile on a grid. So if you move, he’ll run right past you to make it to that specific tile.
top  10 video before disaster  this is the best video I watch
Voice crack "FREEEEDYYYYY" "FREEEEEDYYYYYY"
I’m glad the freddy’s death ending bothered mark as much as it did me that he simply didn’t accept it. “nope we’re getting the true ending!” lol
Mark: "FREDDY" Freddy: " run past mark*" Mark :"FrEdDy yOu bItcH"
I love the part where mark is screaming at Freddy it’s the best
Is it just me or did anyone else cry???
neighbors just having their normal lives..   Markiplier: FREDDY YOU BASTARD neighbors: what the fuck..
the ending of this video was a series of unfortunate events
find me plz
ffs the intro got me
1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00 5:00 6:00 7:00 8:00 9:00 10:00
:)
Bruh I was wearing headphones and then then end when he was yelling "FREEDDYY" I think I need surgery
i love all the bugs just trolling mark
"FREDDY!!!" top 10 anime betrayals 😂
How the heck is moon getting him from across the room while inside Freddy wth
i think the did last scene in a comix style because in this scene robots literally tear Vanny apart
This part made me laugh 28:03
hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Wow at 27:50 when the robot turn and u check the gate/door and after this the robot do the jumscare. I jump and my phone fell to the ground it was funny
28:42
Do you wish to stay?  VANNY!
Freddy and Mark sprinting around the Theater/Daycare each overshooting each other with Mark thrashing his vocal cords had me cry-laughing so hard. This is top tier top 5 best moments in FNAF. And I've been watching since upload 1 of the very first. Oh, amazing.
Ok, this is my favorite game of the series, seeing how mark has dealt with possibly the most pain in this one :D
28:18 I didn't know they had a betrayal ending
*sad ending plays*  Mark:*laughing*  Me:*grabs knife*
Mark screaming at Freddy is the most entertaining thing I’ve seen today 😭💀
28:42 most funny part 🤣 😂
ending supposed to be sad and depression- reality- *WHEEZE*   FREEEEEEEEEEDDDY YOU BASTARD
28:54 Him: Freddy dont wait for your turn god damn it Freddy: Nah be patient ill be there in a min.
I couldnt stop laughing when freddy ran past mark and he started screaming lmao
Worth it for the foxy plush
This game feels just…rushed, and unfinished, should have just done what Scott did when he was in controll and not give us a release date, just, “it gets here when it gets here” and once it’s basically done, announce the date and clean up some bugs. This game needs the fnafworld treatment
Freddy just ditched him oof
28:39
same happened to me
fredy
7:37 freddy stubbed his toe man
When Freddy kept calling him from upstairs so he kept spamming the button to call Freddy but he only goes where he was called so Freddy didn’t exactly “betray” Mark lol. And made it much more worse Monty was chasing him of course so he needed to hide for he can safely hide in Freddy
I love the fact that he's doing commentary on his own videos 😂
I literally choked on my own spit from laughing so hard when Freddy ran by him on the stairs oh my god
28:40  Freddy: aight imma head out
28:02 Alex spider brought me here lol
Okay stop, why did it sound like when the Iron Giant said "Superman" before sacrificing himself when freddy was dying and said "You are my superstar."
This doesn't feel like a fnaf game to me tbh 😂
Mark was right about the red herring IDEA, but what the writers didn't realize is that you have to actually have some other plot going on for a red herring to distract from. Never MIND the fact that Vanny/Vanessa was a perfectly fine villain on her own and didn't need to have some twist added to her.
at the end, the or at around 17:13 was a nod to the times in older games, where they had pixel game looking animation at the end revealing more info
THAT WAS AWFUL OMFG
Since I can’t play the game i made the decision to just watch him play and bro I’m enjoying this sm I love it 😭😭😭
Mark: FREDDYYYYYYYYYYY GET OVER HERE  freddy: I refuse
You may find me... but Freddy sure won't
28:40 had me CRYING, especially when Mark's voice went up six octaves. 😂😂😂 Freddy just went WHOOSH right past him sjdkfkdkd I'm DEAD. 😂
Ngl I really like sun and my
You're my superstar Freddy :( <3
12:50 I’ve heard there really is a reward on the stage. No trap no nothing bad. He just needs Roxy’s eyes to see it
Mark: Calling for Freddy in distress  Freddy: you hear something?
freddy nights at five
21:15 oh buddy
17:17 I know this game was rushed but using a comic cutsene? come on guys just delay the game
Roxy: WHO SOENT 270$ ON PARTY PASSES?!?!? Gregory: Oh no...
Ah the classic mark freaking out about the charging stations being off after being told that the charging stations have been turned off
28:45 lol xD
27:45: best part
I really don´t understand why in every gameplay I see people seem to choose the ¨Vanny¨ option instead of ¨Stay¨ even when Freddy specifically says that he feels there´s more to investigate  besides Vanny wich sounds like a big hint. Maybe at first when reading the options I would want to choose Vanny but after hearing him say that, I would definetly go straight to ¨Stay¨ option... maybe I´m the only one with that path of thoughts? XD (I know Mark said he did it just to see but the other youtubers didn´t)
Mark: click the links below or I will come find you Me: Like Freddy? Cause If so I'm not too worried lol  But for real that last part with Freddy running past you on the stairs got me cackling!!
The entire end sequence of this video reminds me of when your Skyrim horse runs away from you lol
I rewatched Freddy running past mark so many times, and also showed my fiancé while dying with laughter 😭😭😭 that will forever be funny 🤣😂
Markiplier: Running for his life screaming for freddy Freddy: runs right passed him
Mark:"Freddy you bast*rd
12:35
Mark please dear god watch some lore lmaoo 😭
👹FFFFFRRRRRÉÉËĒËÊDDDDDŸŸŸŸŸŸ👹
"Good news, it is almost a 🐔 " 🤣🤣
1:00
It’s a good game ! It’s a really good game but it wasn’t ready to be published 🤗
FNAF is really a fked up game. Jeeeezzzz Gregory really ordered the animatronics to disassemble a human.
gregory and freddy's relationship is so iconic lmao rlly gives besties 4 lifers vibes 💀💀 im gone
28:00
Not mark hitting a whole new Pitch at 28:42
I love listening to Mark blame Freddy when he is just bad at the game lol.
10:46 holy hell, i haven’t flinched that hard probably ever…
Yeah monty not being able to be stunned is 1 thing. But freddy being your only line of defence makes the day care section insanely annoying. I wish he would just teleport to you for player convenience
I think Freddy took Greg to the infirmary because he "sensed" Vanessa was coming to confront him, idk thats just my take on it
Mark, on the verge of death: "FREDDY! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-" Meanwhile, Freddy: *legit vibin to some elevator music*
Markiplier: HOLY SHIT THE GATOR'S COMING FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY  Freddy.exe has stopped responding
Mark: FRED FRED FRED THERE IS AN ALLIGATOR ABOUT TO CONSUME ME   Freddy: IN BLOODEY HELL LAD, DID AH ASK
The outro was legendary
i was laughing out loud at his yelling out to Freddy xD
Venny Ending is the Bad Ending
Mark : FREDYYyyyyYyyYYY!!!!!!!! Freddy:👨‍🦯👨‍🦯👨‍🦯
Bruh, I seriously got a medical eye care commercial before the vid started
28:38 lol
me watching silently eating ravioli's and then mark over here screaming for freddy to help him while he's being chased by monty
Anyone else slightly worried about when Freddy realizes what actually happened to his friends?
0:06  WHOA.... *nice clock*
The fact that mark kept trying to jump into recharge stations was way funnier considering he had to go through that same cutscene that told him they were down multiple times
27:57 through 29:19
Freddy you B*$T@RD 🤣
If ur going to find me like Freddy found u I’m save for so time
28:42 Too 10 biggest anime betrayals
Honestly I've never been a fan of FNAF but this is pretty entertaining
The pre intro totally caught me off guard 😂
Sup
I WAS LITERALLY CRYING FROM LAUGHTER WHEN FREDDY JUST RAN PAST MARK WHEN MONTY WAS RIGHT THERE
i love how freddy is like "you can leave... OR YOU CAN STAY INSIDE OF THE PIZZAPLEX". he wants you to stay
mark got seduced by vanessa 💀
Freddy got jumped
Mark: FREDDYYY HELP MEEEE  Freddy: Y’all hear somethin?
When the person playing your game is watching an emotional ending to your game and they just squeak in disbelief and confusion, you know you fucked up
I was at 4:45 and my bd was really low and I was about to pass out and I was literally seeing what Freddie was seeing stars and tunnel vision and it scared me because it was like tunnel vision 2x
that’s right mark…smile the pain away 👾
29:13 I cannot stop replaying this 💀💀
28:43 FREDDYYYY, FREDDYYYY YOU BITCH got me rolling BUHASHAHSHA.
The “first” ending was depressing AF damn
2:42
Mark: _[frantically running away from Monty around the daycare whilst trying to summon Freddy]_  Freddy: *_You got this, superstar!_*
hmm not enough upgrades to confront vanny and freddy surviving i guess and wow what an ending
Mark threatening to find people when he can't even find his way out of a laundry room 🙄
27:56
Mark: bro what are these security bots  The creator: alright bots lock on to this target here
Why was that part with Freddy so sad-
Mark obviously forgot that Freddy can stun all of the animatronics with Chicas voice box
Freddy: *get disassembled*  Mark: *confused hysterical wheezing*
tbh this game is a downgrade for FNAF series, i love the idea that they went to completely different way, but the gameplay, the pacing , transition between gameplay and cutscenes, its so badddd
I love how im crying st the ending and then mark is like Did they run out of budget for the last animation? And i just burst out laughing
17:28 I think he is forcing himself to not to cry , I watch it from part one till here , so I do cry a little , because it is too bad if freddy died 😭
mark saying I will find you makes me wonder what he does in his spare time...
28:00 the screaming part starts
my names vanessa- love how ur screaming my name LMFAO
Freddy: I HAVE FOXY’S EYES I CAN SEE EVERYTHING also freddy: *runs past mark*
28:01 iconic meme
Bro Freddy running pass mark on the stairs while he was being chased killed me, like bro I got tears down my face!💀
Freddy: Hey Mark, the recharging stations don't work right now Mark: THE RECHARGING STATIONS DON'T WORK WTF
It’s the end now🐒😶‍🌫️
Did anyone else notice that in the cutscene where freddy gets disassembled he already had Monty's claws
Mark you’re making a fucking bag bro you should just make a vlog video where you fucking buy the shit out of a store or expensive shit for your house or you or a car or sum bro you should try sum like that…. You get like a few million views on every video bro ❤️ much love I also grew up watching you bro yayy lmao good shit tho
Mark: The game is a little unpolished  *game bugs out like hell
Mark just trying to go to the charging stacion even the thing said that they will go offline
"Your on your own superstar🏃‍♂️💨"
28:18 bro calm down 😭
I cant when Freddy just rund past mark when he is in big trouble
it seems odd to me that no one is mentioning two things 1 : freddy can't see Vanny so how could to STAFF bots attack her, and 2 : vanny is literally a human in a bunny suit, and we see the bots ripping and pulling, that scene got fucking bloody from Gregory's perspective.
28:42      top 10 anime betrayals.        And the best and highest pitched scream i have heard in a long time. 🤣
i'm curious to see if there are any QA testers in the credits
I find it very odd how Freddy is convinced all the other animatronics are great people His reasoning holds water. Earlier he says "none of them could ever hurt a child. It's against our programming" which carries the implication that they are going against their programming, except for Freddy who seems fine Worried about Roxy and Chica when you damage them for their parts Even says the DJ is "such a nice guy" when he's actually the most dangerous. It raises alot of questions. Is this the normal protocol for a child sneaking around after closing? Or is there a special case here?
Lol Mark keep spamming the "call freddy" button while moving, but what it does is move freddy to the last position when you press it. Freddy will never catch up unless he stops moving
Mark's meltdown with Freddy zooming past him repeatedly and "waiting his turn" to get down the stairs, my mom would have been doubled over laughing watching this.
Wow. The programming on Freddy is  awful.
Markiplier: FREDDY!! Freddy: *runs past mark* good luck supershit
He is just like a lost son calling out for his dad - Freddy 😂😂
Freddy wanted to have fun with mar so that why he went past mark
Dude Freddy’s “you are my super star” had me crying
Oh, Mark.   I _love_ your suffering.
Not Markiplier screaming *"FREDDDDAAAYYYY"* Like a 6 year old girl having a Tantrum XD
Freddy really said "Ight imma head out"
Mark: FREEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDYYYY! Freddy: hmm? you hear something?
"Freddy!  Freddy you BITCH!" he says as Freddy runs right past him.  Thank you Mark for making me laugh harder than I've laughed in a while.
i just realized mark never used chicas voice box to paralyze roxy oh my god
I think the comic book would make sense because if the did the animation and when they  disassembled vanny would be to violet two show
28:45 Music to the ears
28:03
28:53
28:36 I LAUGHED SO HARD OMG MY HEAD HURTS NOW
28:19  best moment in fnaf history
28:41 I'm dead bro 💀
Freddy: *Ditches Mark*   Mark: *”FREEEEEEDDY!”*   Moon: *”Ayo kid, where is that legal guardian you are screaming at?”*
Mark: click the links or ill find you Me: come find me then Bitch  also:  Mark: FrEDdYYYYYYYYYY  Freddy: and then I was like did you hear summ?
I'm getting ads for NFTs.
FREDDY YOU BASTARD!
FREDDY!
FREDDY! FREDDY YOU B*! FREDDY! FREDDY!
FREDDY!!!! FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!!! FREDDY!!!!!!!
LMAO
Am I the only one who almost cried at that first ending? I got weirdly attached to Freddy.
"FREDDAYYY YOU BASTARD" omg LOL 🤣
Mark screaming Freddy while watching Freddy run behind Monty and then past him literally has me in tears!!! omfg lmao
The reason that some of the moments are polished and others feel weird is probably connected to him being cancelled partway through development.
28:30
28:41 cracked me up so bad
I hate those wet floor signs. They're cute but scary.
10:52 so all though out this (and up to this episode) I have been jump scared only a few times .. but this time (with Moon) I was getting out of my room to go to the bathroom then out of now where (at the same time) my dog came running/walking to me, and Moon did his jumpscare. And I dropped my phone on the ground. I've never been so scared before. Until to day
*The ultimate betrayal*      Mark: calls several times for Freddy  Freddy: I'm just gonna pretend I didn't hear that
I swear, those bots and so much scarier than everything else in the game
This game is frustratingly broken.
i love it when mark is in the elevator and you can still hear freddy running, makes me think hes vertically running up the elevator shaft
I sobbed when they DISASSEMBLED freddy
There is like 6 endings to find
Freddy dying when Mark chose Vanny reminded me too much of the Iron Giant, right down to his last words. Man opened a wound I barely even remembered
I’m pretty sure it’s serious mark. Not sure tho
28:40  This part
26:00
Mark: freddy!!.. FREDDDY!!  Freddy running past him while he gets chased: hey how ya doing! *runs past him*  Mark: FrEdDy!!!!!!!!
Mark:*sees a another Anima Tronic ands screams for Freddy for help*FREDDDDYYYYY Freddy: Freddy running away,nope not today
Me: Mark is super chill  Mark: 30:13
Me: Mark’s voice is so soothing Mark: 28:44
0:06 😂😂😂
Mark: FREDDY!!!!!!!!! Freddy: don worry bro this just a game
ive been on this journey so long it just feels like its just me and him on this journey.thanks so much Markiplier this is very entertaining:)
Hehe
Did my man Freddy really just get flogged??
there should be a online version of SB where u hang out in the pizzaplax w/ friends kinda like vr chat.....
28:02 - 29:20
mark you know there's a reticle in the settings for the FazBlaster
jumpscare list:  3:33 i guess that's a scare, not a jumpscare but yknow 7:28 same as first one 10:45 w h a t. 12:22 MARK THE RECHARGE STATIONS ARE DISABLED 27:52 oh my god no not monty not monty not mONTY 28:27 freeeeEEEEEEDYYYYYYYYY 29:13 FREDDDAY!!! FREDDY YOU BITCH!!! FREDYAAYAYYSYDUFHUEEGBDLOFGKIJLHNJ  ok bye

I love the way freddy calls Gregory his superstar
WHY IS FREDDY BEING KILLED THE OUTRO
Me: crys over freddy's death Mark: bReAtHiNg InTeNsIFiEs
28:55 28:55 28:55
10:45 I don't think I have a soul anymore after that one
Freddy, you b**ch, FREDDY !!! 😂
The way mark was screaming at Freddy when mark was about to die was iconic
FREDDYYYYYY!!!! 🤣🤣
*really sad animation comes up where freddy unalives* Mark: *WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEZE*
At 15:50 mark turned into playboi carti
Where's the Freddy don't wait your turn
FREDDY PAST MARK HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
29:18 That Bastard word felt so genuine I almost died😂😂😂😂
if you stay i think thats springtrap
28:42 sigma freddy
28:30 fing killed me bro
on marks comment about the game feeling odd sided with the polish, I think that's just a pit fall in an indie game like this. all games have parts with more development than others, they just manage to blend the edges better.
28:38
The most part of betrayal scene in the game as you guys see right now lol.😂😂😆😆
Me: "I like Markiplier's videos because his voice is soothing."  Mark: 28:42
Mfs were really too cheap to animate the ending 🤣🤣🤣
When I leave a place, I always think of the maintenance tunnels as my exit
5:12 Freddy “nows my chance to find Roxanne’s only fans password” 🏃💨
3:14  So yes, it was worth it.
I didn’t know you can recharge Freddy after six, I thought you were just outta luck. I’m definitely gunna play for the true ending
but i am crying from the first ending you got
i love this series and you you also are doing amazing
3:33 Moon 7:28 Moon 10:45 Moon 12:23 Moon 27:52 Bot 28:26 Bot 29:13 Monty
7:29
how have i never heard falsetto mark before?
28:36 porfavor hagan una animacion de esta parte XDDD
Markiplier:Or i will come find you Me:*Weilds a chainsaw and looks for markipliers house so i can burn it and kill him* Markiplier:ok i take that back *me walking home after he takes it back*
Freddy really did you wrong😭
Lmaoooo “a 🐓”
why is the thought of freddy missing gregory making me tear up
28:02 - 29:20The best part for me! So funny. Love Markiplier's scream!😂💖
My favorite is just when Freddy gose past Monty lol 28:46 bad word:0
Frederick
part 7 at 12:08am 1/8/22 :))
Everyone else when freddy dies: *sad inside* Markiplier: *Consistantly Chokes on oxygen*
Gotta say, best intro ever of any intro I’ve ever seen
Am I the only one that thinks Freddy is like Optimus Prime in personality?
28:30 HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Thats funny😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The episodes official name: FREDDEEEEEYYYYY!!!!
the fact that mark is blind at reading is because in the last part, it said "the charging stations were offline lol
In my head it’s cannon that Freddy ignores Marks calls, because Mark didn’t care about Freddy’s death
I thought Freddy was gonna throw down with Monty...  nope.
Welp marks broken 😂
28:42 jajajajajaja
bro that was so bad i'm only at 18:30 lmao but shit that was bAAAAAAD
freddys my dad now. im adopting him as my father.
Honestly, the glitches would make the game frustrating to play, but it sure makes it funny to watch! 😂
My theory is that vanny is the Springtrap form FNAF 3 because at the ending of the "vanny* ending the security bots tore her apart and if you look at springtrap he is also a rabbit that is all torn a fucked up
26:42
Why wouldn't Freddy just let Gregory sleep somewhere in his room until the doors reopened at 6, instead of making a child run around an empty megaplex with killer robots on the loose.
“I refuse it to be the end”  *makes three more episodes*
I couldn't stop laughing when he was shouting for Freddy lmao
Why did I cry? Uhm help?
You serious you serious are your serious right now!
THE MOON MAN
WHAT HAPPEND what happens what happens what happens what happens fast mode activated* WHATHAPPEND WHAT HAPPEND WHWT HAPPEND
If all the power is directed to the recharge stations at the end of each hour, then why does the elevator work?
8:50 tell me why freddy just scared the crap out of me. i’m terrified of moon and i didn’t know freddy was gonna be there 😭
Maybe vanny is nice?
mark is driving me crazy dude. LISTEN TO THE GAME. i love him tho but OH MY GOD
Freddy: You... are.... my..... superstar Mark and all of us: huuuuuuuuuuuuhkdbfkjasdfp
mark: FREEEEEDDDY Monty:hey there little guy mark:FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDY mark:FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDY Freedy:*on vacation be back soon*
This game is so jank... Like they released it well before it was ready
Freddy dying is the part where everyone cried
Red HAREing… vanny is just a pun
Mark doesn't realise that they said charging stations are off for the last 10 minutes of the night.
29:25 Gregory waited to be rescued......At the expense of forgetting that little kids like him are mere bacon-bits for anyone and anything crocodilian-related. Acts of hubris like building complexes like the one he's in are simply evidence that humanity has forgotten it's preordained purpose, believe itself to be about something more...Gregory's fate is here is a frank, hard and rather ironic reminder of that.
(SPOILERS) This game took me 20 hours to complete I have finally just finished and (SPOILER) got the ending where Vanny gets Dissembled
28:02 the best bit
How is this a 40 dollar game
I love how when Freddy gets his new eyes he's all happy about it, he just forgot about 10 seconds ago they were Roxy's lol
👌
18:00 Okay but seriously did they run out of money why was that so bad
28:30 xd
a Herring as in a " a red herring" is a bird  not a Hare similar too a rabbit
Nice project
Ngl I cried at the first ending that was so sad 😭😭
27:37
28:41 Mark: *spamming the Freddy help button while screaming and running for dear life* Freddy: *Casually runs past Mark when he needed him most*                     Utter betrayal.
Mark: Are u serious? x10000000000 Me: yes, yes i am
mark talking so yelling so loud for freddy my audio started glitching out XD
“FREDDY FREDDY NO,FREDDY NO DONT TAKE YOUR TURN GOD DAMN IT”
Freddy fr said "fuck u lil guy"
im pretty sure gregory is like 11 and the fact that hes not hungry or tired is something i aspire to be able to do. to stay up all night and not get hungry
i love how freddy just got stuck on a corner and mark was just calling him continuesly and freddy was like: "im on my way" standing there
28:40 Markiplier was too stunned to speak
Im literally watching this series to see how trash this game can get
que final del video epico XD
There still one more thing i didnt understand..how is it possible for Moon to found greg in freddy
starting from 27:55 This might be the funniest episode of this gameplay i've seen so far. Freddy did Mark so damn dirty!
Mark: FREDEAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!1!!!!1!!!!11  Freddy: *your on your own superstar!*
Monty is actually Sonic lmao
The last 3 minutes of the video was very fun to watch and should be animated.
28:45
28:45
If you read the words on the side of the news paper it says "blah blah blah blah this has nothing to do with the game". That's a nice little touch Scott placed right there😂
in my opinion mark doesn’t spend nearly enough time in freddy. i would be in there constantly
I cry by the vanny ending
28:02 28:02
If Mark asks "are you serious?" One more time, I may loose my sanity
Fun fact if you try to slide back inside the daycare after you stay, Sun will stop you and call over monty
27:56
*Freddy dies* Mark: after everything we’ve been through….. *laughs*
Me watching him pass by several save points 👁👄👁
Freddy had airpods in
oh naw what happened to vanny 😔
When Freddy is normal people don't give a poop, but when he glitches people announce he's a bish. Sheeeeeeeeeee Also, the dock area houses the good ending, leaving through will activate it, numpty.
jumpscares  3:32 moon 7:27 moon (basically greg screaming) 10:44 moon 12:23 moon 27:52security bot 28:26 security bot 29:13 monty
Freddy is gonna catch these hands from Mark after this video 💀
28:00
“you are my superstar” no pls tell me why that was so sad
mark mark mark, lets get this straight.  yes we enjoy your suffering, but we all know you enjoy it more. freakin masochist
19:34 My math teacher when the school bell rings
“did they run out of budget for the last animation?” mark makes me laugh
lol i love the beginning where freddy said 'it's almost a cock' lmfao
Marks voice was so higher pitched
The beef between mark and the wet floor signs
I'm Death 😂😂😂 Freddy no wan't help Mark😂😂😂
17:56 WOW WAY TO RUIN THE MOOD MARK
Mark: Yes Freddy my savior has come Freddy: Aight ima head out
I liked the comic books ending they somehow fit in
Scott Cawthon pulled an Evangelion ending lol
Mark: *Screaming for freddy to help*  Freddy: eh, he'll be fine :)
7:28 WTF JUST HAPPENED? 17:57 That's my reaction XD
I must say, it would have been better for us to have a couple more hints about the disappearances before the choice scene for story value. Not blaming Mark, but the game studio on that. It would not make any sense to anyone where this is their first fnaf game
Hay! Don't look down on comic art!
FREDDY SOLD
soooo I didn't click the links in your bio but I did subscribe!
Mark: summons freddy to the place he is standing, continues to spam the Q button, also complains about Freddy’s AI
It was so funny when Mark kept screaming for Freddy but he just ran past by 😭😭
me: crying to freddy saying you are my superstar  mark: did they ran out of budget for the last animation  me: crying laughing
Man it's so great that you can use the stage lift to go back up; it'd really be terrible if there was say an invisible wall preventing you from ever going over that top part of the ramp from either direction. Oh wait that's exactly what happened to me, and I didn't know about the save point by the stage so I had to try from way far back multiple times to get down to parts and service and then multiple times to get past that stupid ramp, which I ended up having to bypass by jumping around it, which only works from on the platform, not below it, which means that I was never able to use the platform to go back up because of that stupid invisible wall so I always had to detour through Rockstar Row. Even in the escape sequence. Yeah it was really frustrating. I still really enjoyed the game but there were some major issues that I hope they fix.
Is it just me, or was Vanny kinda thicc in that cutscene.
Man, this game is a fucking shambles. This is unforgivable on multiple levels.
Freddy took Gregory to the medical station and then said that he is broken, Gregory is the crying child
i love how he is so confused from the most obvious parts
I just imagine when he retires from YouTube due to being old and hims saying “Thank you so much for watching and I am thankful for all that you’ve guys have done for me bye bye” 😭😭😭
GOOD NEWS IT IS ALMOST A C1OCK P.S. "They ran out of budget for the ending" - Mark made me laugh so much
Mark there’s 6 possible endings to this game hope you can finish them all! Love the content
I question some of this mans actions sometimes. . .
Lol 6,9m views and 420k likes xD
This comment section mad funny, i cant-
In the end of the video he looks like he edited it
I love the way whenever mark comes across the caution wet floor bots and it makes the dramatic *dun* noise and mark just pauses and says, "hi"
17:58 sound of sadness
Freddy 😭😭😭😭
I havent laughed about anything as much recently as freddy running away from mark when monty was after him
5:08 Freddy heading to Roxy's room to quickly retrieve her onlyfans password while he has the opportunity
Ask The Gods.
THE WAY THAT FREDDY JUST RAN PAST MARK IS THE FUNNIEST THING EVRE ISTG😭
Freddy: *dies: Me: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Mark: *wheeze*
17:40 they pulled a fucking Neon Genesis Evangelion.
[Insert joke about Freddy running past Mark when he needs him here.]
I wait for the day that mark realizes when he calls Freddy he calls him to the spot he pressed to button to call him, not to marks moving locations lmao
28:42
Anyone hear “Vanjie” whenever Vanny is mentioned?
15:31 "im telling my mommy bro" why did i say this when this happened- :,)
28:00 Freddy leaving mark, and his voice so high pitched, made me laugh. Its been a while sonce mark made me laugh
Btw depending on what missions you do first decides where you go next. Ex. I watched a different playtrough of this game and in the other playthrough one of the missions the creator was giving was go to the theatre. So it depends what you do
Mr moon man bring me a dream make it the scariest that I’ve ever seen.
28:26
"FREDDY YOU LITTLE BITCH"
28:01 ✨THE MEME YOU'RE LOOKING FOR✨
Everyone: cries at Freddys death. Mark:diD tHey Run oUt oF BudGeT foR ThE last ANIMATION?! *LAUGHS*
I wish my dad called me a superstar
Little did he know that there are so MENY secrets
ඞ
28:42   That got me laughing sooooo hard
Mark: "FREDAYYY" Fredy: 🏃 Mark: "FREDAYYY YOU BIT*H!!" priceless 🙌
top notch
27:57
Is this freddy supposed to be golden freddy?.... No nevermind I'm dumb
Mark is right. It really feels like they poured all their heart, effort, time and budget into approximately half of the game and then shat out the rest  Still incredibly incredibly impressive for a small studio but absolutely not worth the price
28:44 Oh My Stars Markiplier I have never hear you scream this high before my life
mark: FREDDEEEYYYYYY!! freddy: *runs past him* mark: FREDDEEY YOU BITCH!!!! me: 💀
Freddie: Look at my boy. Oh no my boy!  Mark being eaten: FATHER HELP
28:41 I cried! Freddy off to get child support from Greggory
at 25:35 he gets a freddy mask does that mean there could possibly be glamrock tormentors like the original 4
Theres alot of endings one of dem u can go against springtrap
I'm gonna cry
Mark: *FREDDY U BIT- d i e s-* Freddy: *uhm is he alive*
you are my superstar...
That Vanny ending. Just....an awful  and confusing mess  Guh
Am I wrong to say Mark is a bit too impatient with Freddy?
so funny how everytime he sees the little CAUTION WET FLOORS bots and says "hi"
I love how happy freddy was when he got the eyesss my childd😭😭😭😭💖💖💖💗💕❤‍🔥💘❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹❤‍🩹💌
Mark:"FREDDY!! I NEED YOU! FREDDYYYYYY!!" Freddy:"I missed the part where's that's my problem"
This game is so bad lmao
28:39
mark be like  FREDYYYY FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY  FREDY PLEASE OMG NO NOT LIKE THIS
28:02 FREDDY NOW NOW FREDDY
The funniest part is when Mark says did they run out of budget 🤣
28:42 The funniest part ever Freddy:* Runs past Mark * Mark:FREDDYYYYYYYYYY! FREDDY! YA BAETCH.!.... FREDAEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!! FRADAEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!! I CANT STOP WATCHING THIS XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Talking. About ends there are more than 3 endings
oh my god haha freddy got scared too he ran away right past mark oh my god marks reaction hahaaa i cant breath
Freddy running past mark because he summoned him upstairs while Monty chasing down him was some scooby doo bullshit
Was laughing my ass off when freddy ran past him and Mark started having a breakdown!🤣🤣
Mark: FREDDY HELLLP Freddy: imma pretend I didn’t hear that
I already laughed at when Mark was calling for freddy but 28:40 had me crying 😂
Spring trap is in the pizzaria :)
Mark…I just commented on your tik tok vid with Amy👁👄👁
the injury detected was  a missing head. hear me out. theres a lore theory bgoing around that gregory is an animatronic of the "CRYING CHILD" that was decapitated at a fazbear pizza place and this new freddy in security breach has his olders brothers soul inside him. and its a glitch between soul and machine. his soul remembers the death of his younger brother, "the crying child". the crying child is important.
Since they make the fnaf comics I think their tying it to those so maybe a new book and after the book another game
not me yelling CLICK THE BUTTON when hes on the main stage -------.-------
Freddy gets his stomach ripped off Mark: *Wheezing sounds* Also mark: FREDDY HELP MEEEEEEEEEEEEE! Freddy: NOPE
omg I'm dying XD The animation I seen of that makes sense now XD
THE MONTY CHASE SCENE STRESSED ME OUT SO MUCHHH
Can we talk about how random that intro was
Freddy:"Lead the way superstar" Mark:"Well THANKS DoOr"
me being named vanessa😫😫
You should have seen the leave option first to see the other ending before the  choice to stay
i cried like a baby help
Freddy telling Gregory he is his superstar before crashing completely is kind of heartbreaking
28:45
Mark: “The golf. You know.. the golf?”  Monty Golf on the screen right in front of him: ಠ_ಠ
28:02
Mark called out for Freddy a total of 24 TIMES! If that doesn’t speak some volumes about Freddy’s loyalty and or hearing… I don’t know what does
1)28:54-28:57  2) 28:02-28:06  3) 28:21  4)28:36  5) 28:45 And a new meme was born
7:25 < my soul left my body 💀
Okay, but if vanny isn't actually an animatronic- and just a person in athe costume-, then-..... what happened when the bots 'disassembled' her—....
"get me in you" -markiplier 2021
I came from the animated! Lmao Mark soundbite is hilarious
28:40 FREDDY!!!!!!!!!! Freddy: :||||||
When he was like Vanny when the question to leave stay or vanny was asked I kept laughing each time I replayed it
Even if they didn't have the budget to animate maybe they could have done a more graphic novel style and made a more cinematic ending, the comic style is WAY too off
Anyone see _"The article has nothing to do with anything relevant to the cave"_ ?
Markiplier: hears scream  Also markiplier: what happened what happened  what happened what happened WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED!?!?!?!?!
Freddy: *dies* 17:55 mark: did they run out of budget for the last animation? 18:08
when did mark become really forgetful
Turns out Freddy is the most evil of them all and is just constantly manipulating Gregory throughout the game, which is why he left mark with monty😶
I love watching you get tormented
feddy "Fucking dies" markiplier *WHEEZE*
me not clicking on the link coz i wouldn't mind if mark came and found me :)
9:35 why does Vanessa sound so sexual😳
Please play gas station simulator again
I have never laughed so hard as when I did at Freddy running past you SKEKFKKDKE
7:37 This is a man entering full madness.
okay 10:45 was the only part in this series so far other than the map bot that actually startled me LMFAO
Freddy litterly went like: yeah see ya looser, not dealing with this. God damn, if only I could outrun my problems like that...
Jumpscare List: reposted for myself, original by flying potatoe  3:33 Moon  7:28 Moon  10:45 Moon  12:23 Moon  27:52 Security Bot  28:26 Security Bot  29:13 Monty
“Go to a recharge station” Mark: does not go to a recharge station
I love the ongoing joke that the wet floor bots are the scariest things in the game, haha!
Me and the boys wanting mark to come find us 😏
please come and find me mark😍🙏🙏
When mark said "Power, power, where's power?!" My phone hit 5 and my screen went dark...I was so confused lmao
OMG WHEN FREDDY RAN PAST HIM WHEN MARK NEEDED HELP ABUAHAHDJDMEKX
Me when he said he would come for me if i didn't click on the links: "I would be generally happy if you did that bc u is my idol, so come find me"😈😈
28:40 to funny
The ending was the best and the funniest moment 😂
Freddy ran past Mark because he only goes to the spot where u last called him at
23:29
I feel so bad for Mark after this video that im actually gonna click his links. just for him
Why is Freddy saying “You are my superstar” genuinely emotional
💖(*´▽`*) 27:52 to 29:12 I feel like this sequence of him screaming freddy could be a banger animation💖
But his reaction when he saw Freddy running away at the end was funniest thing that I ever heard.
Those yellow caution bots will always hold a special place in my heart
Mark: "HELP FREDDY, FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!"   Freddy: "Yo wats up Monty long time no see"
wtf was that weird comic ending
28:05 is the funniest thing😂
OMG HE FOUND ME!! I SEE HIM WITH A KNIFE OUTSIDE MY HOUSE!! SOMEONE HELP!!
Are you serious? X1000
27:26 La parte mas graciosa
is it available on computer
Mark when he sees the ending : “wheeze” “wheeze” “wheeze” “wheeze”
Fred’s betrayal animated stat!
It’s the fact that Freddy follows the path you take. And Mark doesn’t realize that.
7:38 i cant LOL
0:05 Meiosis in a nutshell
Mark : Desperately calling Freddy while running from Monty. Freddy: Finally decided to come Freddy: Walks right by Mark  Mark : Gets killed because of Freddy’s betrayal.
When the daycare attendant is active, what is the stary stuff around the outside of the screen?
Bro was flabbergasted 😮
While Mark was running and screaming throughout the pizzaplex for his survival, you can hear Scott laughing from a far distance, as if it was intentionally planned for Mark.
Game: nope not allowed mark Mark: ARE YOU KIDDING ME Freddy: he'll be fine Moon: I'mma get yoooouuu
28:00 LOL IM DYING
24:44
STOP IM WATCHING THIS AT SCHOOL AND MY FRIEND JUST ASKED WHY I JUMPED
0:05  Freddy: Good News! It is almost a cock.
*supposed to be a sad, emotional moment*  Mark: did they run out of budget?  18:08
honestly the map is so cool. They should make a (dark)souls-like game out of this, with the animatronics as bosses and all the staff-bot types as generic enemys
27:54
When Freddy ran from him 😭😭
Nooooooio Freddieeeeee ;(
Freddy being like na fam I'm good when Monty is chasing him
I CANT WAIT TO SEE THE FUNNY MONTAGE FOR THIS SERIES
28:39 for the funniest replay
Are You serious Right now 10000x
i would have like to see the leave option before he went to stay
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU LEAVE
Mark: FREDDY HELP ME YOU B*TCH! Freddy: F L I N T L O C K W O O D
Love it
ok if you choose to stay you ca'n't save and if you get caught its over!  also mark stop threating us!
OMFG MARK. it said you cant hide in charging stations to hide from moon fucko  you fuckco!
6:57
Why u laughing  I’m breaking down in tears right now😞😂😭😭😭😭😂😭😞😭😞😞😭😭
WHY did they decide to not let you save after deciding to stay? I would have gone absolutely banaynay if I had to redo everything every time 😫
FREDDY!!!!!!!!
i love the 30mins of mark screaming freddys name
28:43 The way Freddy just ran pass Mark as he screams at him is hilarious
Mark at 19:34 👍👎✊🙌🙌👏✋🤚👉🤟🤌👌✌️🤏☝️☝️👋🖖👐👐🤲✊
Mmmmm tasty suffering 😋
28:03 is what your looking for
Freddy just like f**k you kid you on ya own Vroommmm. Meanwhile in the background FREDDDDYYYYY! You bastard!!!!
so moon is stronger than freddy? if he's able to get gregory while he's in freddy, that's bs. Freddy could easily beat him.
Mark: FREDAYYYYAYAYAY FREDAYYYYYTTYTYTTT 👹👹👹👹  Freddy: no thank you 😊
"FrEdDy! FrEdDy, YoU bItCh!!"😂😂
WAIT HOW DO ROXY AND CHICA NOT RUN OUT OF BATTERY
I watched the majority of this video in 2x speed. I don't know why. It makes the people in the game and Markiplier sound funny.
Idk if Mark is ever gonn a realize he goes to where you were when you pressed the button, not where you are currently.
I just want to see Amy's face as Mark screams FREEEEEDDDDAAAAAYYYY
why did vanessa say it so seductive like
I love the way he hasnt noticed that freddy literally goes where he points whilst calling him
Best Part 27:52
Mark: *screaming and running for his life* Freddie: *on a leisurely jog*
it's all fun in games until you realize Vanessa, A HUMAN, was in the vanny suit and supposedly getting ripped apart violently.
28:36 FREDDAEAEAAEEY
It was kinda sad when Freddy died
Me watching the video just to hear "FREDDY YOU BASTA** x10000
17:46 SQUID GAMES ! !
freddy: "you... are my superstar." mark: *W H E E Z E*
Mark: chooses stay Door: I am glad, I found party passes! Mark: THANKS DOOR TALKING ROLLING DOOR
28:43 laughing for hours at this moment😂😵‍💫
I don't know if I'm supposed to be crying or laughing when Freddy died because of Mark's reaction and now I'm doing both and I'm confused
*Let's all take some time to appreciate how  much the game quality has advanced since 2015, I mean those graphics are actually unbelievable. Scott Cawthon is doing things he may have never been able to imagine ever being able to do in the past as a smaller game developer. Let's all give him a round of applause real quick.* ❤❣💕👏 (Also I'm trying to grow my channel for my first upload a sub would help.)
27:39 Poggers freddy
Jesus Christ loves you
That Mission Plan A jump scare got me as I was eating. I managed to stab my top row gums with my fork. I bled for almost an hour. 🥺 I have learned a valuable lesson today.
Stay, Leave, *Vanny*
OK
good news, it is almost a cock
I hope he gets all the endings, at least the canon ending and leave ending and hopefully the best ending, maybe the loading bay ending and the fire escapé
Saying this as this is my first time viewing, I feel like there should (again I dont know) be an ending where freddy pieces together what happened to chica and roxy and have something happen from that. I thought that wouldve been cool yet horrifying.
HELPPP IS ON THE WAYYYYY!!!
28:36 Is a moment to remember
THE END OMG. THE RAGE WAS SO FUNNY.
Vanny has 2 options you could have played all 3 princess quest games and got a diff ending
I feel like Mark doesn't realize the he should ride in Freddy more often rather than exploring on his own.
don't mind me... *cries*
XD
Not everyone yelling at Mark all the duff ways he could get there fast.
17:50 I felt that 😞
I think the thing with freddy is that he goes where you are pointing at the ground rather then your location. And I don't think Mark realized that.
Bruh. "you are my superstar" got me sobbing in my seat. I can't handle this
That moon thing was like SHADOW CLONE JUTSU
I can't stop laughing at Mark screaming for Freddy and the comments are only making it worse 😂😂😂
Gregory: call Freddy for help Freddy: “I’ll save you superstar” Monty: “Freddy I have roxys onlyfans password” Freddy: ran pass Gregory in the speed of light
Why does markiplier go such a roundabout way to get to the exit doors? He makes it so difficult for himself through-out the entire game 🥴💀 me thinks he thinking too hard
i remember Roxan glitching through the elevator
FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!!!!!!!
Am I the only one that jams out to the elevator music every time he goes into the elevators?
No no no mark. That was all your fault freddy was trying his best to get to you and you were running away from him
M  O  O  N   M  A  N
*really emotional scene happens* “Wheeze- Did they run out of budget for the last animation?”
Fucken dying 😂😂😂😂😂
Marks outro of the bots beating the shit of of Freddy had me dying 🤣
Gregory acted like his whole reason for sneaking in was to investigate the disappearances. Hm, yeah, okay random child without a guest profile therefore meaning the bots _can_ hurt you. As smart as you seem to be, you weren't smart enough to get a fake guest profile? I doubt you were initially here to investigate disappearances. Also, Freddy being all sad about that, he's so human. I love this Freddy so much. I really hope it doesn't turn out there's lowkey a spirit in him. Makes that Vanny ending even more traumatic.
28:40 funniest moment in this whole series🤣🤣🤣
Freddy dont give a fuck
“FREDDY YOU BITCH FREDDDYYYYYY” 😭😭😭
Freddy realised that he's been used by Mark as a hidey hole for the entire night and he's had enough.
22:09 Mark: "power power we need power" Freddy: "we stay hungry we devour"
**Freddy Dies** Mark: **Wheezing** Also Mark: Did they run out of budget for the last animation?  edit  FREDDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA YOU BASTARDDDD
27:10
4:11
18:08 "did they run out of budget for the last animation" scott cawthon: yes
28:30 the fun begins
Markiplier:doing codes Freddy:iTs aLmOsT a cOcK
23:48
What a sad ending :(
Mark:*Calls freddy* Freddy*Running* He’s a runner🍃 He’s a trackstar💫 He gon run away 🏃 💨💨💨💨💨💨💨
Moon can get you when your in freddy
Freddy!!
the idea that the wet floor signs are just constantly screaming is such a fantastic idea and i am in love with it
freddy was just like your on your own now superstar lmao
‘do you want to stay,stay or vanny?’  so we cant leave?  no we cant  but-
28:00 when mark was screaming for freddy i laughed so hard i squeezed my balls and now im hurt
I have to say, If this game was only released once it was fully polished and completed, it would be a fucking masterpiece
28:42   LMFAO
9:26 has a sussy Vannesa 15:26 sad mark
*I Will Find You*   and I will exploit *You*
Vanny : "Go check the main stage..." Mark : "I did that and there was nothing ! You lied to me !" That, sir, is commonly referred to as a trap :D
This is what you are looking for: 28:00
FreDD🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
Oh no
you are **my** super star                First fnaf game to make me cry
The game : " Charging stations are now offline and can't be used " Mark: " I'm gonna hide in the charging stations "  lol
Holy wow that ending is godawful lmao. Like cool idea with the disassemble Vanny thing but the cut to the last cutscene is SO JARRING and then comic book panels for no reason? Just terrible. This game has cool ideas but man is it overall super disappointing.
14:27 that had me rolling for some unknown reason to me that was the funniest thing in the world
I AM EVERYWHERE !!!!
i just about started CRYING at the vanny ending
FreDDY YOU BIIIITTTCHHHHH"
Not him calling me out for not clicking on the discription
why doesnt mark pay attention when they explain things? like how the recharge stations will not be able to save you for those 10 minutes
"FREDDY, FREDDY, FREEDDDYYYYY"  😂😂😂
The security bots are scary man the jumpscares my heart lord please help me 😂
Moon is by far the scariest animatronic in the game
The end of this video was so good with Mark screaming.
It's probably he's running from someone else. Mark: FREDAAAAAAAYYY FREDDY U BITCH FREDAAAAAAAAY
What actually may have happened or so I think anyway I think that he got jump scared because it was 5:59 but I'm not sure so correct me if I'm wrong
27:52 ur welcome
MAN this game sucks in so many ways. I appreciate mark making this very entertaining.
lmao this game sadly suck ass the more you play it, it had such potential
FREDDY NOOOO lol
The music in the elevator sounds Great 👍
16:25 Uh...No. That was MEANT to happen.
Got dayum the stay option just makes the game into a rougelite lmao
22:44
This is the reason I k ow darkaplire still exist
28:00
who else here who thoght that thia was the last epeisode bc its only 30 mins
9:48
They should do a patch where if the player spams the call Freddy button then Freddy goes straight to Gregory and automatically puts him in his chest, Freddy still has to get to him normally and maybe also make it dependent on whether or not we’re being chased but I think it would make sense for Freddy because he knows if he’s getting spammed then Gregory is really in trouble
Mark refilled the gamer instincts
28:41 well markiplier looks like you are screwed
you dont know how many times i screamed go in the elevator at the start
mark: "this cant be the end"  well mark thats how we felt on the last day of unus annus
Freddy just left Gregory for dead. 28:39
28:39 - Just a nice time stamp :)
“It’s past your bedtime….”   So this bitch is just gonna *assume* that I have a bedtime?????  Edit: 11:40 Yes mark, I’m being serious 💀🤚🏻✨  Edit 2: hey boo…how are you?..          Roxy:…  *they took my fvcking eyes*
10:43 MY HEART SKIPPED A BEAT
Freddy thought you wanted to play with Monty so he didn’t want to disturb you lol 😂
Mark: “I will find you” Also Mark: walks past really obvious things over and over again
I laughed so hard when it played the comic ending
28:42 - 28:50  Freddy: *runs past* Mark: FREDDY FREDDY YOU *****.... FREDDY.... FREDDDDYYYYY Me: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣

it is hunts me wat mark said "did thay run out of bugid" xDDDD
Freddy yeeted past you. Gangsta betrayal
good news! it is almost a *cluck*
FREDDY!!!🔊FREDDY!!!!!🔊FRE🔇Ga🔇VAYXhxuduc🔇DYYYYY
“Did they ran out of budget for the last animation?”🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Game:*ENDS* Markipiler: wheezes....Me: IM DEAD
Freddy: runs past mark Mark:screaming hysterically   Me: laughing so hard I can’t breath
What happened?
"moonman"  Wow mark... just wow....
Vanessa Afton
Vanny is Vannesa  afton  vanessa has a split personality disorder. DID LIKETHE DEAD OF NIGHT WITH   JIMMY AND  HUGO PUNCH
Freddy be like not today mark you have It under control
Freddy be like not today mark you have It under control
do mission plan A
Why do the weird wet floor sign bots make FNAF 2 noises
"FREDDY, YOU BASTAAAAAARD!!!" -Mark 2021
Ending: **Trying to be sad**   Markiplier: **Wheezing Noises**
Alternate title: Mark goes into shock so many times that he develops smoker's lungs
6 more endings
they really shouldve optimised Freddy so he only pathfinded (pathfound?) to the most recent ping.
27:57  28:36
love how he was yelling freddy as he was running from him and Monty lmao
Mark: *in a scene that supposed to be emotional* Also Mark: *heavy wheeze that sounds sorta like a laugh and a cry at the same time*
In freddy's defense freddy mark was spamming the button and he goes to the button press location.
Freddy running past Mark - 28:39
The garbage and roaches in the corner in the theater gave me hugs house flipper vibes
Well vanny is one of the reasons for the disappearances
Mark: *keeps asking "are you serious" over and over* Me: No, I'm Severus
28:00 Here you go.
LMAOO  when freddy runs past mark  the screaming was freaking on spot
Your the best Mark I’ve been watching you since I was 15yrs old now I’m 19
That ending was the best, Freddy just like "Later loser" with Mark screaming😂😂
Mark:FREDDY Freddy:you're on you're on superstar Mark:FREDDY YOU B!CH FREDDY    "dies"
Mark: “You sprint a bit, but not for _that_ long, so…” Moon: AND I TOOK THAT *PERSONALLY*
Man, that whole 'exit' sequence seems well designed to be annoying, what with the darkness, the absolutely arcane moon guy mechanics, and the explicit forbidding of save points directly after you do the eye thing.
27:52 I dropped my FRICKING phone because of this jumpscare XD
go to 27:52 for the mark yelling "freddy!!!!" while being chased by monty
mark having a crisis over the game saying the charging stations are closed and then continously trying to get into a charging station has me slamming my fists on my desk
I think most of us want you to find us...
i'm gonna cry "you're my superstar" STOPP 🙁
Freddy detecting something wrong with Gregory is something you would never be able to tell unless you saw his model. Gregory has a bandaid on the cheek and another one on one knee, which means he is, indeed, injured. That's probably what Freddy deems as "broken". I really wish they would allow you to properly see Gregory through the game.
28:42 top 10 anime betrayals moment.
28:40 please this bit is hilarious. When he need Freddie the most he just ran past him.
Keeping my spot ignore this 21:05
Mark: *laughing at the bad quality ending*  Me: *s o b* FredDdFddYyyYyy
I wonder what Amy was thinking when she was just chilling downstairs and hear "FREDDY YOU BITCH" screams from the distance xD
FREEEDYYYY U BASTARDDDDDD 29:17
i feel attacked eveytime he screams at vanessa the security guard bc my name is vanessa 😭
I haven't seen Mark yell down to the left like that since Happy Wheels highlights. Lmao
That vanny ending was rushed trash haha
Soooo funny how Freddy ran past him
28:55 is where the meme starts
Mark: FREDDYYYYY HELPPP freddy: she’s a runna she’s a track star 🏃🏼‍♂️💨 *runs past mark*
@ Moon @ Moon  @ Moon @ Moon @ Security Bot @ Security Bot @ Monty
@ Moon    @ Moon    @ Moon    @ Moon    @ Security Bot    @ Security Bot    @ Monty
For anyone curious: the reason Freddy sprinted past Mark was most likely because he was still headed towards the location where Mark first called for him in this room, ignoring all subsequent calls.
GOOD NEWS IT IS ALMOST A COCK
28:40. This will be written down in history of funniness.
“Did they run out of budget???”  Mark you aren’t allowed to actually be funny 😂
27:16 I think the reason those areas are there is because of the messages you get to piece it together
28:42 As Freedy passed Mark and he started screaming, I started laughing so much!  > u < Definitely the funniest thing I've seen in a long while :D
again, gregory is a whole ass mystery.
Freddy be like: 🧍‍♂️
What vexes the sh*t out of me is how he purposely makes mistakes. Just turns his back to the patrolling bot in the theatre knowing full well the bots spin around themselves and he has no saving spots left. Just disappoints me how many times he simply doesn't look to the right and left. Just walks past all danger and gets caught all of the time. Play smart, not fast.
Markipliers reaction to the ending animation gets me every single time
Hey can someone explain why Gregory's view is all sparkling? I might have missed that
mark i feel like they wanted to make even more animatronics but couldnt (its why you can see bonny in so many places but it was said that he was destroyed AND the fact that there is alot of foxy merch)
It amazes me that mark is somehow able to pick up on tiny little details and bits of information that will never be of use and likely go undiscovered by most players, yet he manages to completely ignore tye most obvious things and important details about the mission and proceeds to have an existential crisis while complaining about how the game must be broke. Still funny as shit though.
Freddy goes to where you were when you summoned him. You were summoning him while running away meaning he'd never catch up to you.
Yo that intro got me dying
Game tells mark the charging stations are offline Mark completely ignores the info Also Mark "why can't I use it why can't I Use it why?" Me: because it's offline duh 🙄
20:50
Freddy: “Nah he’ll be fine, he doesn’t need any help.” Mark: About to get killed by an animatronic gator.🧡🧡🧡
Why a comic book style there? I'm confused but also still very impressed
Hey everyone, there are a lot of bots in the replies, always report them for hate speech, it will get rid of them quite quickly! No need to reply to them
Mark: *screaming for his life*  Freddy: bye bitch-
28:37 this part had me dead 💀
FREDDY YOU BASTARRRRRRD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love how at 18:15 Mark is laughing but meanwhile that pissed me off Freddy did not deserve that it made me cry I won’t deny it and I haven’t cried that hard since I watch Clementine kill Lee
I hope, he doesn't have any neighbours
15:39 Mark: I am confusion
FREDDY U BASTARD LMAOOO
27:50
Not me screaming at my monitor in the first part of the video for mark to use his Chica scream
I feel so bad for Mark because he had so much bugs in to his videos
28:37  believe me this the best part
Somebody should really animate the part where Freddy runs past him.
28:02 LOL

markiplier is like slowly becoming a theorist  like join the lore club man weve been waiting
When Monty was chasing you my first thought wasn't TEMPLE RUN TIME
28:41 Freddy's like see ya fucker!!!
For god sakes man you're somehow the worst player with this game. Just stay focused it ain't that hard..
Mark refused that to be the end and we gor 4 more hours of gameplay
We used to scream when Freddy came into our room. Now we scream when Freddy can't find us. Funny how that works.
Wtf is 7:38 😭😭
I am cackling “FREDDY YOU BASTARRRDDD” 😂😂😂😂
22:34 there is a circus baby plush
Omg why is he so slow and oblivious to 6am
Freddy completely ditching mark was the funniest shit I’ve seen all day.
the entire episode was Mark refusing to believe it was the end. me, loving it
Snaff bot ?
The best part  *Mark frantically running for his life calling Freddy*  *Freddy casually running past Mark then waiting his turn on the stairs*
28:40 freddy looked like he was bouta beat monty's ass then just proceeds to fuck off has to be one of the best things i've seen period.
it was too funny😂😂
mark should  consider being a game reviewer
i lowkey cried when freddy died
Mark: **calls Freddy and is screaming** Freddy: I’m gonna pretend I didn’t see that Mark: FrEdDyYyYyyYyYyYY!!!  *top 10 anime betrayals*
I love how lost Mark gets and he NEVER checks his map.
you never use freddys powers. Why didnt you stun moon with chicas screech
8:00: Markiplier straight up become Henry at the end of FFPS
Oh my god the high pitch FREDDY YOU BITCH! and then Freddy waits his turn down the stairs made me laugh so hard😂😂😂
27:52.  😱😱😱😱☠️☠️☠️ fraddy you pi*ch  28:43 😱😱😱😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Wait mark there is something there you just can not get it right now
FREDDY is Even Scary monty😂
“No Freddy dont wait your turn” 28:54
27:52 - 29:24 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
“Did they run out of budget for the last animation?” LMFAO
28:38
I like how buggy the game is
i laughed at the part where like freddy betray you lol
26:06
29:17
YO when moon got him on the main stage I jumped and almost droped my computer.
28:41 FREDDYYYYYY!!
I know what they did to Freddy, they made him go to the exact spot you called him so if you move after you call him. Then he go's past you to the call spot
small part of me thought freddy was gonna square up to monty to help Mark out, but the actual outcome was much better
*me trying not to cry when Freddy got torn apart*
I love how this play through is a perfect mix of Mark being stupid and the game being stupid
I can't help but wonder what happens if you just pick the option to leave
Markiplier "Freddy you bastaaaaard"
im crying now T^T (when freddy said "you are my superstar"  I dunno why but OML)
Mark: "FrEEdDdDy!!!" Freddy: "you got this my superstar :D"
Markiplier please come to my house It has been 10 days since I haven't pressed on the links
28:40 Freddy: _sikeeeeeee_
Freddy was fixing to kick Monty’s ass on the staircase
28:27 ive never laughed so hard in my life
17:49 Sad Super Star
this is the buggiest game I have seen come out of 2021. yeesh. thank you for playing so we don't have to, Mark.
28:40 was the best part of this series lmaooooo
28:42 Mark: **desperately calling for Freddy while trying to escape Monty** Freddy: 🏃💨    Edit: I wasn’t expecting 2k likes thank you guys!
Mark i didn't click on the links please come find me !
That’s the first time we ever here mark wanting Freddy  Unlike him in 2014
Freddy marks screams  Freddy just gunna for a midnight run
FrEeDe
28:03 for those who wants see mark scream FREDDY
27:42 is when all the fun begins
I love how Mark considers "6:00 am" to be PAST his bedtime.
This whole series is Mark running circles around the objective because he didn't listen to Freddy or read the objective briefing hahaha
Freddy was trying his best this episode  His best to get away from Mark.
I have learned dont scream gasp loudly and scare your friends
FREDDY YOU LIL B*TCH!!!😂😂😂😂😂
"FREDDY YOU BITCH! FREEEEEDDDYYYYYY!"
FrIEDdeYyyyyy
28:42   markiplier: calls freddy *  freddy: nah your on your on seeya !  markiplier: FREDDY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
game caption: lets begin by removing freddys face youtube caption: lets begin by removing daddys face     ngl i kinda hear that too 😳
The comic strip ending certainly threw me for a loop - part of me wonders whether it was budget or artistic, as I don't want to judge harshly or jump to conclusions, especially with a franchise that has provided me with much entertainment over the years. (I mean, it's neat in its own right, but I was kinda hoping for the beautiful graphics of those cutscenes.) Regardless, after the time leading up to it being filled with varying degrees of doubt as to whether Freddy could truly be trusted, seeing this ending actually brought me to tears, thinking "maybe it's still too early to say this, but HOLY CRAP, HE WAS GOOD ALL ALONG" 😭 (The games leading up to Security Breach having totally obliterated anyone's ability to trust any animatronics, after all...)
"Ahh, a place for babies!" -Markiplier  time stamp: 27:31
Well mark from your little experiment we think you also like your suffering
You are my superstar ☹️ got me crying
17:50 This is the best reaction I've seen from the this ending
The intro 💀💀💀💀
Dude. I love Vanny so much. And the fact that he said “disassemble Vanny” made me immediately realize that Vanny is human and it made me cry.
istg this game is so dumb 💀
vanny is literally a killer bunny
Gregory its not safe dont come back ill miss you  OK NICE YOUR STAYING-
Vanny looking kinda thick...
27:40  ITS BONNY
Freddy hitting the dash past Mark as he screams for him is the funniest thing I've seen today
I’m actually crying of laughter
This game sucks let's be honest
I swear mark doesn't read
FREDDY
That was some twomad editing at the start
He said freddy 22 times.
I tested positive with covid 19
Ok but the way mark was like "stay? Leave? vAnNy!!!!" makes me think of miss vanjie
FREEEDDDYYYYYYYYY
Freddy: you must go, Gregory Gregory: Vanny Freddy: Som of a bitch, I’m in
27:59 🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣
28:43 when mark was screaming for freddy and freddy just ran upstairs and ditched him his reaction while yelling “freddy you bitch” got me dead.
They might be setting the game up for DLC or maybe the reason for certain things being out of place because Scott retired
mark: *getting chased by monty* also mark: *makes an attempt to get freddy*  freddy:*runs past* mark: *gets killed by monty and has to start over* also mark: “FREDDY YOU BASTARD”
Foxy. Chica. Bonnie. Alligatorman.  Long ago these 4 nations lived in harmony. Then the purple guy attacked. The only one who could stop him was Freddy. And when markiplier needed him the most,  _he vanished_
i really think this game was rushed to please players but more time or a clearer storyline could’ve been put in bc there’s a lot of bugs and a lot of things just don’t make sense. it doesn’t really feel like fnaf to be honest and i’m sure players could’ve waited another year for a better game
please tell me he played the princess mini-games so he can understand what is vanny (probably he saw some theory videos and stuff but thats okay)
Mark: Desperately calling for Freddy's help  Freddy: Y'all hear sumn?
I never knew it's possible to have so much frustration watching a playthrough... The absolute refusal to retain knowledge when the game hands it to you...
“you can’t use charging stations this hour”  mark ten minutes later: *desperately trying to hop into recharge stations and screaming*
love how he says hi everytime to the caution robots
Markiplier 50% of the time FREDDY!!!!!!!
Imagine Freddy pretending to be your friend all the time, only to stab you in the back 10 minutes before you can leave. Just running around when you're running away from the moon guy, and running past you on the stairs when Monty is right behind you :D Also: "All recharge stations are now offline" Mark: "I'm just gonna go to the recharge station!"
28:00
Mark: FREDDYYYYY!!!  Freddy: Oh this seems like the perfect time to chat with my good pal Monty
And now thanks to this game I kinda want a Freddy figure
I think the reason Freddy ran right past cause he was going to where Mark called him to
I guess I wont click on the links so Mark will come find me c:
This brings me so much joy 😂😂😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hi
29:14. Rage quit moment.
I almost cried when Freddy said you are my super stare 😭
I don’t know how but my brain just called Gregory geography so now Gregory is called Geography
IM CRYING BAHAHA THE WAYFREDDY LOOKED MORE SCARED OF MONTY THAN MARK AT 28:43 😭
this game is buggy as hell
Someone please animate mark screaming out for Freddy when he needed him the most and Freddy just ignoring the shit out of him 😭
Security Breach still has a lot of bugs especially with Jumpscares in the middle of cutscenes which can make you lose all your progress you've just completed
I think they didn't animated vanny getting disassembled was because she was human so they put it in a way that your character sees it as a comic without the bloody details
17:49 got me crying in that part
Mark: *pressing Q so can Freddy help him* Freddy: not now Gregory I gotta help Gregory Mark: *freaking tf out*
If you traveled to the past and told 5NaF 2 era Mark that in the future he would be screaming for Freddy to come, he would have called you crazy or something.
am i the only one who sobbed on the freddys death part-
I think the biggest challenged this episode has posed to mark is the amount of bugs in this game
Wow you are really good
That's what separates us from you, Mark. We enjoy watching you suffer, while you enjoy your own suffering
🤣🤣🤣 F***ing bastard🤣🤣🤣 “Good news! It is almost a cock!” Not while I’m drinking, dude! I wasn’t ready for that!😂😂😂
28:42 That's why you're here.
Anyone also watching this while reading the comments so that they won't get scared
I’m crying, this is why I commented TwT. CUZ I MEAN LIKE- FREDDY - HELPED GREGORY ( aka the player ) AAAAAAH!
you do realize..when you call freddy at a specific location he IS gonna run towards that SPECIFIC location...didn't you learn that in the first 3 videos....also basic strat was to call freddy..make one loop and freddy is on spot and hop in and you're good..but noo you keep calling freddy having him to literally keep running BEHIND YOU!!
28:00 Pov: Your looking for the time stamp because you’re lazy :)
If you are from TowDev-Sensei channel...... It's on this part 28:00. Enjoy....😂😂
You do relise that when you "dissassebled" van you were killing Vannessa in the process
28:35
The way every time he get look at my the cleaner sign bots look at him just “ *hi* “
Jesus christ. Mark should work at game theory. He can guess this shit like a fortune teller that works.
Mark : " *screeches on top of voice for freddy* "   Freddy : _eh he's fine_
No I hate seeing the dissemble of Freddy I saw it and now I have to watch it here so time to see the next part and when I finish I’m a binge it again I like how he chose stay after vanny
Bro this is too funny
28:03 highlight(freddy you betrays!!!!!!!!)
when hes picking up the bag in the theatre u see a figure run past the doorway
mark: are you serious? are you serious? are you serious? are you serious? are you serious?  my Siri: ya talkin to me????
FREDDDYYYY FREDDYYYYYY FREDDDYYYYYY
28:40
Great intro 😂
Why doesn't Mark just hide instead of run blindly??
28:42 XDXDXDXD IM DYING XDXDXDXD
Besides the joke, mark is amazing because he can escape monty without freddy help even though his  stamina is drained
The suffering is delicious and sufficient
6:15
10:42 was the first time in the whole series so far that I actually jumped
Mark: FreeeddddYyyYyYY  His neighbors: ?
Man if I was in Gregory's place I would 🏃💨 as soon as that door opened. Tell the police to investigate those disappearances but I'm not staying another minute 😂😭
11:35 Mark being broken for LIKE 25 SECONDS😃✋
I think what happened was that by spamming the call button it would only go the first time and ignore all the other one he cant change trajectory mid run
You know who the real villain is?  Those bots, and the moon guy
I think Freddy pathfinds to the place you were standing when you pressed the "Q" key, so every time you press it and run, he goes to where you *were* as opposed to where you *are*. That was hilarious, though. xD
I do like the song played after the "Vanny" ending. I don't like that there is no way to save after you make it to the exit. I didn't realize there was a warning at first. I thought my game was bugged. I think it's just a way to make it more challenging if you truly want to unlock and discover everything but I still don't like it...
Mark: "FREDDIE I NEED YOU" Freddie: " I missed the part where that's my problem"
The part where Freddy ran past Mark kind of reminded me of that scene in Peter Pan where Captain Hook is desperately trying to avoid getting eaten by the crocodile and calling for Smee.
yeah the ending that are like a comic book "look bad" and i wish they animated it but i guess it fits
28:37 got it yall
The real ending is animated so not this one but there are a lot of endings
This game is so bad it's amazing
Find me, I dare you markiplier because I'm getting a gift and would love to show you irl to see your genuine reaction to it and you can play with it Just don't break it like freddy 🤣
14:30 this is funny because my baby cousin calls me vanny because he cant say savanny and my aunts call me savanny so he says "BANNY" or "VANY"
"This can't be the end...." That's how I felt about Nier:Automata, but then I found out there are 26 endings.
Game: recharging stations are disabled right now. Mark: has existential crisis wondering why he cant enter recharging station.
When Freddy ran past mark at 28:40 I died.
I love how Freddy's death is supposed to be some big sad moment and Scott is acting like we just forget that for a decade he's been killing us
You need months claws for 1 ending... Which is underneath Roxy Raceway, there's a door that leads underground and you have to bash through a gate with his thing
10:40 sure...
Freddy really said “I missed the part where that’s my problem.”
There is a way to save the game after 6am what have to do is go to Roxy raceway grab the driving head from the same spot as before and then go to the save slot near where the go kart would be and you should be able to save there once you save the time will go back to 5:15 making it so you can save anywhere you want
not that anyone cares but, if the theory that michael inhabits freddy is true then, what if freddy is so protective of gregory because he reminds him of crying child? the one he could not save. i dunno man gregory just be reminding me a bit too much of c.c.,
I Just Love How Mark Just Yells “FREDDY!!!”
9:27 😳
the editors of fnafsb have got to be sooo embarrassed
Best part honestly is Freddy running pass mark in the most Important moment
FREDDY YOU BASTAAAARD!!!
0:04 Lol
28:42  We all know we came back for this moment.
U can find spring trap if you havent done that yet still watching the series
I watched him get out of freddie but it still scared the shit out of me when he turned around and freddie was there-
I just love the parts where mark rages an flips out it’s funny
Lol “I will find you. I will find you. Thank you.” One of the best sayings ive ever heard XD
At 28:27, I was CRYING of laughter!!! Him screaming at Freddy after he ran right past him had me laughing so damn hard!!
It would be too Gruesome if it was animated, vanny is a human years u know
holy crap mark, I heard you voice crack during that freddy scream.
The reward was death
mark will probably find us, unlike Freddy
7:38 Wonder what happened
Mark: FREDDY FREDDY freddy:your fine Mark:FREDDY!!!!! DONT WAIT UR TURN ME:re watch an laugh so hard
For anyone wondering, the part where Freddy started ignoring mark started at 28:04! Your welcome :) <3
5:10 Mark: _HURRY UP, FREDDY!_ Freddy: I wonder how Roxy's doing...
It was the worst anime betrayal 😭😭😭😭😭😭
This is a series dedicated to mark's complete inability to follow simple instructions.
The amount of times my name was said 🤣🤣🤣.
Since nobody else is giving the time stamp to Freddy ignoring Mark completely and running away, here you go.  28:00
28:40 LOL Best part
29:14 Freddy you Bastred lol
0:05 you know damn well when Mark was editing this he was laughing so hard
"FREDDY!!! YOU BITCH!!!! "       -Mark, 2021
When he got the mission plan A the moon drop guy scared the crap out of me and I jumped and I almost fell off my bed
HELP THE WAY HE JUST RAN PAST YOU
I had a good laugh by the end of the video
28:40 funniest shit I’ve ever seen. Just fucking Freddy booking it away from mark 😂
27:52 literally shit my pants
in the cutscene where freddy dies you can actually see that Freddy has Monty’s claws, so getting the claws changes nothing, sorry Markiplier.
28:02 is where it begins.
I love Markiplier but he really do be not listening to the game explain stuff lol
First 8 seconds and already laughed.
UUhhh when Freddy got ambushed by the STAFF bots he had Monty's claws... at 15:27
WHAT'S WITH THE OUTRO 💀
28:01 OMG PLEASE- WHEN I TELL YOU I WHEEZED I WHEEZED
Poor Freddy. Trying his best to keep up with Mark's commands and getting pinged relentlessly for a solid minute to go to a different position every time. It looks like the AI was queuing each of the input positions so he had to run to each point Mark pinged him at before moving forward
wait the part 8 has more views than 7? what?
The Freddie call takes Freddie to the place where you call him. If you move he is not gonna go to you.
28:42
28:18 - 28:44 pure comedy gold
The king of FNAF is back in action 👑👍
THE BEST PART 28:42
I feel so bad for him. He's struggling but it's just a poorly made game..
Markiplier: "i didnt have an injury why did freddy take me to the medical place" then he realizes freddy did it to avoid you getting caught by the security guard early on before the main exit closed at 12
This was by far is one of the worst in the series
I actually just had a theory watching this episode along with the last one that answers a question about the Afton family canon. In Help Wanted we of course remember Glitchtrap, the bunny that was a sort of virus version of Springtrap/Scraptrap and that Scott actually confirmed was William Afton(of sorts). Looking at Vanny and Glitchtrap side by side you have to admit they look the same except opposite genders. So if that is true that Vanessa is Vanny, then could that mean then that Vanessa is Mrs. Afton!? Mrs. Afton I'm pretty sure was never given any actual details and that Clara was made by the fanon, along with her connection to Ballora. Plus that would explain how Vanessa was such a high ranked worker of Fazbear Entertainment despite being just an intern.   If you agree with this theory please like it so the KING of FIVE NIGHTS at FREDDY'S sees it too and maybe it could be spread even wider.   Sorry if I figured it out too late
Rip Mike Hoffman 🙏 god rest his soul
The best part of the video is at 28:40
Why is no one talking about the intro that shit killed me  "Good news it is almost a cock!" 💀💀💀
freddy: robots are killing him  mark: stares at what is happening
The Vanny cut scene shows that she's a human in a suit because of the stitches in her costume and the fact that there's no separation in her torso, legs, head, and arms like the real animatronics (typing this half way through)
Jesus there's a lot of "Person A: Person B:" or similar comments here. You guys need some more variety in your jokes lmao. I mean, I've made and laughed at plenty of those in the past, but y'all are starting to overdo it. There are 13 of the same format in a row in the Top Comments for me. Do you know the odds of that happening with almost 25k comments? I'm almost impressed.
Its funny how the game has a pop up message or verbally explains what is happening only for Mark to just ignore it and be completely lost
does anyone know why the vision changes when Vanny is close by?
Man's said they ran out of budget on the last animation 💀💀💀
28:28
Convinced they didn't have time to playtest this game
Mark's hysterical shrieking for Freddy as he casually ran past him in his hour of made me laugh so hard I think I gave myself a hernia XD
Anyone else think Vanessa delivers that “I think you deserve an award” line a little too...sultry?
14:36 clicks vanny: Leave her Gregory shes a six at best
Mark: FREDDY!!!!! Freddy: I missed the part where that’s my problem
Please. Somebody else comment "I missed the part where that's my problem", trust me it'll be funny.
28:45  I damn near choked on my pizza XD
My friend: who is the scariest character in fang security breach  Me: MAP BOT
sometimes it's ok to hate vanny
“It’s.. so CLEAR! I think..”  *intelligence +100*
I love 28:02
28:32 is the best part. The yelling is halarious.
18:14  Yo, can someone translate this? 😂😂😂
28:33 :,)
freddy: *dies* mark: lmao broke ppl
Not Freddy ignoring instructions just like Mark has been doing the whole time lmao 28:42
Freddy’s a jerk
Mark when he needs help Freddy: Oh hell nah! Better luck next time!
28:55
28:41Me when I call my pet and he doesn't come XD
You gonna find me like that laundry room door? Lmao
I feel like they got too lazy to actually end it properly so they just made it into a comic book
*beep beep beep boop* good news! it’s almost a cock!
28:22-29:20 IM DEAD BRO XD
28:38 The way he was screaming for help and Freddy COMPLETELY ignored him—
FREDDY *runs past him*  FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
freddy: wow i can see things through walls now! mark: freddy come over here freddy: im blind suddenly
Come find me mark I'm waiting 😈
Mark, at the top of his lungs: FREDDY Freddy: y'all hear something?
cutscene: turn to a comic story. Markiplier: *did they run out of budged?*
1:20
0:70
Overall the game was okay. Mediocre at best I think. The biggest thing they have going for them are the graphics, the game looks pretty damn good but the story is so confusing, the beginning makes no sense??? Have it to where he hid in freddys stomach to escape Vanny not this “I just climbed in here for some reason.” Like bruh.  I think I’d also add dialogue options between Gregory and Freddy, kind of like in titanfall. BT is one of the best characters because you need him to progress pff screen but you can still talk and you both do it often.   Decent game, could have used a bit of polishing with dialogue and story though and more interactions between characters.
Lol me waiting for mark to find me… lol
Nah mark, you're completely right. This game wasn't finished. Endo basement, Daycare, and DJ Music Man were the best sequences. And then suddenly, Endings weren't actually animated and relegated to comic panels. It just wasn't finished.
"I know the you, for some reason, enjoy my suffering" don't act like you don't enjoy it either, you masochist 🙄
I havent seen Mark rage this much...ever
"See you on the other side ig"
28:08 here
Mark: WHERE'S THE EXIT?!?! The main exit that closed at the very beginning at the game that Freddy specifically said would reopen at 6 a.m.: Am I a joke to you?
the special ending is with the 4 golden plushes
is 4 endings!
Freddy running past mark has me weak😭
Mark: FREDDY FREDDYYYY FREDDDDYYYYYYY His  Neighbors : uhhhh is he ok?
I think it got cut short because the cancel mob came after Scott and his family.
*freddy dies* Mark: **confused wheezing**
25:09. God dammit!
Wtf is this game 😂
Watching mark is so frustrating
Freddy litterly betrays mark
No one’s gonna talk about how he has glitter in his eyes?
Most likely the reason why that last scene was a comic strip instead actual animation was because vanny was probably human so when they disassembled her, it was probably very bloody and she was more likely than not screaming
Dang, FNAF's having actual cutscenes now..
28:33 this is da funni part
16:13
Just so you know there are several endings so your right it ain’t the end
I think that Vanessa is one of the People who were basically enslaved by spring trap to kill children that’s why she was recommended by “high up” to be a security Guard because William afton/spring trap was still alive because of the spirit of the 5th kid he killed still living inside of spring trap with him
me not clicking on the links so Mark will find me
Vannesa is a bit too sus
at 3:53 when the captions said “let’s begin by removing daddy’s face” HDHHFJJSHD
I find it annoying how little this moist potato knows about the fnaf lore
i definitely didnt cry when freddy said “you are my superstar.”
Freddy: *dying* YouTube: SAVE MONEY WITH CASH APP!!
Mark: "FREDDY!" Freddy: *runs right past Mark as fast as his legs could take him* Mark: "fReDdY!!!!!"
NOOOOO THEY TURNED BONNIE INTO BIG CHUNGUS
Tutorial how to do true ending: WARNING SPOILERS BELOW      1:Get all upgrades (roxy, chica and monty) 2: Go to the docks  3: Find the old elevator 4:go down 5: do the boss battle against burntrap 6: i dont know the rest I hope this helps!
he weezing doe
28:35 freddy leaving mark is the funniest
17:45 Freddy last messgae was so touching
Y'know, it's very likely the animators used furries as reference for Vanny. Not sure how to feel about that...

just save the game what the hell
Him saying serious Serious siri Siri seriously serious Siri serious Siri serious is so funny lol 😆😆😂😂😂
Fnaf iron man simulator
Vanny is vanessa,s twin sister
I'm loving this series, but seriously it angers me how stupid Mark's coming across as when he straight up doesn't listen to the instructions and doesn't know what to do.
Hey Markiplier,you wanna know whats more brutal then freddy getting disassembled? Vanny is a human and when she got disassembled guts and stuff prob came out.
27:55
27:53 bruh-
come find me then
Come find me. I’m in VA.
28:29
Mark: Calling for freddy’s help Freddy: I missed the part where’s that’s my problem
Happy new year everyone
good news it is almost a c*ck
“you... are my... superstar.” sending whoever wrote that my therapy bills.
28:10 timestamp for my personal use
28:12  FREDDY BE LIKE: YE IM JUST GONNA IGNORE THAT-
Terraria hardcore mode
Im drunk af rn this is great
God bless everyone Jesus loves you and died for you
God bless everyone
Freddy running past Mark while he's screaming is the funniest FNAF will EVER get.
Love how every episode he has to voice over himself
Freddy betrayed mark
8 days later, haven’t clicked the links. Where you at Mark? Your coffee is getting cold
28:00
*me blinking on beat to freddy going up the stairs escaping from moon*
2 things I hate about this part of the game. Why does Vanessa sound so sultry when she says "go check the main stage" @9:29? And who the hell decided to give Vanny tits?
28:40 Thank me Later
Happy New Years mark!
In fairness it was kinda your fault trying to go somewhere you were clearly not suppose to go.
Mark from upstairs coming downstairs: *FREDDYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!*  Freddy: "I think I heard someone calling me upstairs"
I fucking said clupgrades at the same time he did 😆
MARKIPLIER GET YOU HEAD OUT OF YOUR AS- your the king of fnaf   lol
I have *never* laughed so freaking hard at Markiplier high pitched screaming for Freddy while Freddy just zips passed him... I thought I was going to pee a little. Best moment in the whole series so far.
the most funniest scream "freddy,you bitch"
Mark: What happened?? Me: u didnt- Mark:What happened?! Me: u did get out- Mark: WHAT HAPPENED?!?!? Me: U DIDNT GET OUT IN TI- Mark: WHAT HAPPENED?!?! Me: im not telliing u now
28:40 Freddy betrays markiplier
Mark: *spamming Q while screaming in pain* Freddy: "Ooooooo I sEe YoU'Re HaVinG FuN, KeEp GoInG SuPeRsTaR
can i enjoy the comedy stylings of snafbot 26:26
28:40
The last 2 minutes of this had me in hysterics
I love listening to violent screaming before the new year
dude idc what other ending there are with freddy alive, him “dying” made me fucking cry
28:00 - Wherefore art thou FREDDY?! XD
Mark: karma doesn’t exists in 1 player game ok? *some minutes later* Freddy: so you said karma doesn’t exist Mark: FREDDYYYYYYY YOU BISH SAVE MEEEEEE!!!!
Homeless Gregory
Im litterly watching this in 6 am
I think what explained why Freddy ditched Mark in the end is because Mark was spamming the Go Here button (Q), and it was messing up Freddy's A.I.
23:25
28:10 lol
The Fazer Blaster to the animatronics gives me the vibes of going "Bad Kitty!" and using a squirt gun to startle them.
Who else is here after watching Mat’s video for context?
Freddy: *Literally dying* Gregory: *Crying*  Markiplier: *wheezing* DiD tHeY rUn OuT oF bUdGeT fOr ThE eNdInG sCeNe.
Chica:Get’s voice box ripped out and a destroyed beak and survives  Roxy: Get’s eyes teared out and survives Monty:Smashed in half and lost his claws and survives Freddy: Hole in the chest and broken a bit and dies cause of that
*Mark screaming for Freddy* Freddy: After you Monty :) He can wait.
Lol. Freddy was like you can handle Monty I’m on my coffee break. 👀
I just went from crying about my lack of money and missing my mom who died in February to laughing my ass off at you screaming for Freddy
WE MUST AVENGE FREDDDYYYYY
I started lowkey crying when freddy died, keep in mind i have never cried during a single movie, tv show, or videogame ever and i take pride in that.
27:53 The time when mark screams for Freddy
play the yakety sax theme around 28:15
14:30
Damn bruh have destroying Freddy at the end, well this game changed my life.
THIS ONE IS LOOKS LIKE A MEME HES LIKE “FREDDYYYYY!!!! FREDDY YOU B@#%h FREDDYYYYY!!!!!”
Its so funny that mark tried the charging stations even after it said he cant hide from the moon man there because theyre closed
Freddy: **Literally dies**  Mark: **wheezes**
We all love Mark and we all know the game is buggy, but we also all know that Mark is practically blind and deaf whenever any key information is spoken or provided. Its endearing at times but cmon mark we dont gotta scream at the monitor for a couple of episodes where you have to go when they repeat the instructions several times in different ways. (Again the games hella buggy and i give it to him about that weird chica scream door with no instructions, that was bad design)
18:03 I love how mark complains about the sad ending and laughs.
pls the betrayal 😭😭😭😭
POV: your going to the comments to see if someone has the video mark 😌  yw 28:20
mark: *HEEEEEELLLLPPPP HEEEELLLPPPP FREDDY WHAT THE FU* freddy: remember when I didn’t give a shit?
28:41 mark:FREDDY HELP ME freddy:i got better things to do
28:38 the money shot
Freddy: careful the charging stations will be closed!  Mark:why won't the charging stations work?
Mark: freddy FREDDY FREDDYYYY AAAAAHH!!! Freddy: sorry superstar cant help you.
He said "FREDDY" 26 times
Which part does Freddy ignoring mark happen?  Im only here becuase I saw an animation of it and I need to know where it is
Mark: *screaming in panic*    Freddy: 🧑‍🦯
wait why were u able to get the vanny ending?
27:54 for the only part you came to see
"is this the end :(( i dont want it to be over :(((" *three more parts @ this point in time w one being over three hours*
The fact that you can't save when going for the true ending is honestly disgusting. Removing a basic function of a video game dosen't make it more scary, it just makes it immensely frustrating.
"Good news, it is almost a clock." lol why is the intro so funny
28:42 is comedic genius
I seriously wish this game wasn’t so buggy…
this game has so much potential
mark:''screaming desperatley for Freddy to survive'' Freddy:''eh he'll be fine''
When I was like in 1st grade I saw an animation shiping jack and mark together I thought they were the creators ocs-
The end when marks wok e went high for a sec  😂
I finished the game a few days ago so now i'm viewing how youtubers fared playing this fnaf. I must say i'm amazed how Mark failed in every possible way the escape the pizzaplex sequence. You get a message with a lovely image of the main exit you saw at the beginning of the game, he is warned the recharge stations won't help him and he manages to go in the wrong direction when all he had to do was to go FORWARD ALL THE WAY. Parts and Service -> Elevator to stage of the Atrium -> Lobby -> Exit... He had no clear idea of the layout of the Pizzaplex since he almost never used the map or the cameras. Why did the developers even bother to put these mechanics to help players when they don't use them ?
such a strange and clunky game its kinda disappointing :( that sudden switch to comic story telling despite the lack of a previous introduction, the strange and random transition to being in fazerblast, etc... and its probably like this because the team working on it was rushed for a quick release. it had so much potential too, cool character designs and mechanics, attractive and interesting setting, theres just so much that really went to waste.
Mark: FREEEEDDYYYY Freddy: nah, man that’s ur own problem
28:03
Mark: **in absolute panic, about to be murdered** FREDDY I NEED YOU! Freddy:  remember when you let me get attacked? yea. sucks to suck doesn’t it?
Freddy really said “now don’t rush me pal” this episode…. It’s hilarious
I imagine Mark threatening to “find you” is like Freddy trying to find you…. nice try Mark but I’m feeling awfully safe right now.
WHAT THE FUCK???????????????????
I swear "you are my superstar" got me sobbing
all the endings except for the true ending are comicalized
Mark really said, “Freddy you bitch” when he walked past him
I HAVENT SEEN THE ENTIRE EPISODE IGNORE ME BEING DUMB BUT IS GREGORY THE CRYING CHILD ?
27:56 You're welcome
No mark they didn't run outta budget they thought it would be cool to have a comic book style thing
This game's map is way too big and convoluted for the purposes of this game and no auto saving for critical moments where players are likely to die is ridiculous.
Mark: desperately calling out to Freddy Freddy:I missed the part where that's my problem Mounty:Am gona put some dirt in your eyes
27:56 – 29:20 meme 😉
So uhh- everybodys gonna ignore the start?-🤐
Doesn't know recharge stashions are shut dwon
28:19 here you go :)
The people next door when mark is yelling: ... Is he okay
28:45 his voice XD
28:12
Mark ignoring the map for 7 episodes is so annoying
i was about to say something about mark screaming "Freddy" but all the comments are that lmao
That comic book thing with Vanny literally looks exactly like a prototype cutscene placeholder...I wouldn't be surprised if they replaced it at some point in the future.
POOR GREGORY THIS GUY GONNA FUCKING LIKE NEED THERAPY
15:40 WHAT THE FUCK
Haven't laughed so hard at a markiplier video in a long time. Just watching Freddy sprint past while Mark is being chased is too damn funny
The entering feddy reminds me of titanfall
Freddy barreling past Mark on the stairs just not giving AF while he is screaming his head off might be the funniest thing I have witnessed in a while xD
Anyone else experiencing the glitch where the service elevator doesn’t work after the ocular upgrade?
This video has 5M views bro. That’s crazy to me
holy fuck this is my favorite video, those screams when freddy misses you
Freddy : Hey Monty! Monty : Hi there Freddy! Freddy : How are you doing? Monty : Nothing special, just chasing that kid around. Freddy : Alright, I'mma head upstairs now. Monty : Mhm, cya Freddy!
Freddy really said ight ima head out
Freddy: Good News! It's almost a Cock!
sussy baka
The Mark asides are the best.
A red herring is a fish, ironically to use a red herring as a smelly fish to distract the hounds from the bunny
The beginning of the video be funny tho XD
Mark: FREDDY!!!! Freddy: And Gregory?  He Is not Call me
Freddy as he walked pass mark: ay whats up homy
Freddy went to the wrong side of the hood and got jumped lmao
28:34 best part of the video
28:00 - 28:42 Is amazing lmao
Mark killing his throat screaming for Freddy💀
Freddy's like that knight from Monty Python who keeps running towards you for 5 minutes but never gets any closer.
Top ten anime betrayals 🤣
FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!
28:03 😂❤️
The best thing about Markiplier is his patience of playing a game several times, where most of us get frustrated and bored. This is indeed appreciating
28:20 is the best time I can't stop laughing hahahaha
Damn, Mark is a funny guy but the game is actual crap.
It would be interesting If when moon caughs you he'll put you in a bed in a room where you gotta escape from
9:48  mark panicking on beat be like
Game: The charging stations are offline Mark: I'm going to a charging station
27:55 have fun 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂
Mark desperately screaming at Freddy. Freddy : *IT'S NOT MY FAULT! YOU DECIDED TO STAY HERE*
I love FNAF but this game is horrible 😂, Mark makes it better
Yo I think "plan A" is vanny's plan, lure you to Main stage to get caught by moondrop
We stressed mark out
27:50
The permadeath sure added some intensity to that chase by month lol
Ah yes, the panicked screams of fear as death is near for our dear Markimoo, music to our ears is it not? 😌
pls find me
there is a glitch with freddy. freddy goes to wherever you fist called him . no matter whether you move or not
the daycare music playing in the back while mark is desperately crying for freddy's help as he is chased by Monty is seriously the cherry on top of the cake
28:01
I totally get what you're saying about the whiplash this game has. It's good moments followed by mediocre ones constantly.
freddy really went: "youre on your own superstar-"
That was one of the worst, most anticlimactic and undeserving endings I’ve ever seen to a video game before… There was no tension, no buildup, it’s just… over… what the hell…
happy new year people   happy 2022 🥳🎉🎊
Mark: FREEDDDYYYYY I NEED YOU  Freddy: Nah man you can wait imma go make a tiktok real quick.
*Super sad ending*  “You are…my superstar…” *Death*  Mark: *Confused wheezing*
mark seems to not have picked up on the fact that freddy does not follow you. he comes to were you hit the button like dropping a beacon on the floor. so rappidly hitting the button while running around is not going to help. lol
28:12 your welcome, this is where the FREDDYYYY begins 28:40, where freddy walks right by the child screaming for help
28:19 funny
did you notice the hat freddy got
This plot is lame lmfao
Tbh, they rushed the vanny ending
Mark just reads everything and forgetsvit all immediately. Like with the disassemble Vanny ending where he didn’t understand anything because he ignored everything he heard in Fazerblast.
11:29 “Are you serious?” x19
Mark: *screaming frantically while panicking and loosing his sh-t* Freddy: he’ll be fine
Vanny was human and they disassembled her
???? why was the vanny ending drawn????? like, it looks nice and the artists were obviously skilled, but it was so thematically off??? they haven’t used comics as cutscenes in the game previously, so i feel like it comes off as unfinished/lazy/etc.
Me: not cliicking the links in the description bc i want markiplier to find me🥺😇
28:41 HAAHAHAH
i think there's going to be DLC, there's going to be a figure of Glamerock bonnie, and mr. hippo, do i'm thinking they're going to be added in later.
**Mark screaming “FREDDY!” in a panic**  Freddy: “I missed the part where that’s my problem”
28:47 had me dyinggggg
“Freddyyy you assholee”  As he’s running away and pressing the button. 😂😂hes not broken marks just impatient 😂🤷🏾‍♀️
“I think the game didnt play the way it does right now”  No mark. You just didnt do the things in the right order😂😂
28:42 When your teammate refuses to help you in Call of Duty Zombies
When Mark was screaming for Freddy and Freddy completely ditched him I laughed way too hard and nearly woke up my little brother 😂 Didn't know Mark's voice could go that high!
this pizza could have used some more time in the oven cause damn this is scuffed
Is anyone else still just fantasized by the overall setting and animations of the game the glossy shiny floors and the neon lights 😍 its so 80s its so vivid
mark dont try to make sense of the game the lore has never made sense its ok LOL
i’m just gonna put 28:36 down so i can come back to this part whenever
The entire Freddy scene has me weeping I was laughing so hard. Just the fuck you he gets as Freddy zooms past him.
28:44 "FREDDY YOU BITCH!!!" XD
vanessa’s voice is kinda….
Markiplier yelling for Freddy was the best
Top 10 anime betrayals
the way Vanessa says “go check the main stage” hits different every time
Mark: FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY!! Freddy: I'ma ignore you
Even in a dire situation Freddy is still polite 28:52
I have to be honest, Mr. Mark's playthrough was something else. Somehow his difficulty with following instructions resulted in a _lot_ of needless confusion, and ultimately breaking the game. _Obviously,_ that isn't his fault, the game should be so easy to break in the first place, but I feel like his experience with the game was *majorly* thrown out of wack- Effectively killing the experience he was likely _meant_ to have.  Also confused on how he seemingly couldn't put together the fact there are multiple endings best _not _*_just_*_ on_ his actions, but the choices at the end too. I do not know what else to say... ┐(‘～`;)┌
Mark:FREDDY!! FREDDY! FREDDY YOU BASTARD Freddy:Nope
is that bonnie? 27:41
27:57
Anybody else cried when Gregory say Freddy disassembled? Cause I sure did.😭
Vanessa sounding BAD when she's tryna convince Gregory to come to the main stage. 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳
People not minding His Jumpscares
Mark! all chargin stations are offline during the final stages it notified you of that the first time
just now realized that moon man kinda sounds like smeagol from LOTR
Daddy 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
Freddy: "Nah he'll be fine, he doesn't need any help."  Mark: *About to get killed by an animatronic gator.*
Moon drop
The escalator meme: 28:00  You're welcome!
Inscryption Part 6?
You'd imagine Freddy would have a bit more fight in him 😂
The ending really made me want William warfstasche to come back
Freddy: *dies* Everyone Else: FREDDY NOOOO Mark: *uncontrollable laughter*
Glad u had a good time at my daycare😈
Mark can leave 😀 the video still has 17 minutes left 😦
28:00 LMAO
17:10 through 18:00 I’m dumb and almost cried cause I’m a crybaby
On the idea of cohesiveness (to which I definitely agree with your point): Dawko did an interview with steel wool recently and they said something along the lines of they kept finding things they wanted to add. I think they tried to add everything and in the process the “fluidity” of the gameplay got lost. That’s not to say that this game isn’t an absolute labor of love or that there isn’t good parts but rather that sticking to a streamlined idea might have helped.
this game was such a fail damn
Markiplayer is now broke
Ok, but disassemble vanny is like really terrifying... this kid just ordered to have someone's guts and limbs ripped apart
FREEEEDDDDYYYYYYYYYY
mark
My neighbors probably hate me at the way I laughed so loudly when freddy ran past a screaming Mark 😂😂😂
18:05 i started sobbing
28:29 don’t wait your turn
28:43   mark screaming dramatically for Frieddy: FREDDYYYY   Freddy: Was that greg, nahhh, WAIT let me wait my turn.
I do feel bad for laughing my ass of when you in true pain. But that Monty chase down at the end was just pure tragedy and comedy in one.  I think you right think this did have alot more planed than deliverd, and sucks they bugged freddy like that. then again, you never should have trusted him XD
Freddy: are you having fun yet?
I feel like this game got rushed around the end tbh
28:42 I laughed so hard lol
I love how mark did a whole rant about how the theater is useless, before the mission where it's used
28:00 need I say more than watch
2:58    *”I don’t know what’s that’s about”*
28:00 you’re welcome
So does Vanessa not think that the other workers are not gonna come in and be like wtf happens to the animatronics
Freddy breaking hearts this episode wdym you cannot live with us and escape PLEASE and the you are my superstar?????? SOBBING
Freddy literally said “you are on your own rockstar"🧍🏽‍♀️💀
I saw the comments about Freddy ignoring Mark and I deadass thought it was this scene 5:07 but now I’m wheezing
i had my cc on and when mark died and had to do the eyes again the cc said start with putting daddy's face- 💀
27:42 is when the part that had me doubled over, in tears laughing stars
Mark: FREDDY WHERE ARE YOU HELPPPPP freddy: sounds tuff
Me at 12:20 it's calm to were good lemme just drink my sprite Me at 12:22 *nearly chokes and spills my sprite
it’s almost a 🐓
Jesteś memiczną postacią
28:07
Mark: FREDDY AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Freddy: *zooms past him* Mark: bitch ō_ō
They murdered Freddy 😭😭😭😭😭
I was dying when he said did they run out of budget for the last animation?🤣🤣💀
“FREDDAY FREDDAYTYYYY”   Freddy: 👨🏻‍🦯
Wait the ending was so SADDDD
28:03
Mark screaming "FREDDY YOU BASTARD" makes me smile so much it hurts.
Too bad Mark never found Princess Quest 1.  Also that you can't save after missing so many collectibles is BS.  Mark never found the Freddy battery upgrades which is really, really shitty for post 6AM.
Ur need to get the springtrap ending but apparently his name is now burntrap
youtube….      **Why 3 ADS one was enough**
It’s almost a what Freddy… 😳
The game seems so unfinished people rushing this sucks
I cracked up for the first time during this series when Freddy just ran right past you oh my god that was the funniest thing
Freddy had better stuff to do
28:01
This game seems rushed
yikes this game is buggy
Funniest ending ever lmaoo
Newsarticle: *bla bla bla this article has nothing to do with anything relevant to this game* MatPat: "TREASURE"
It all starts at 27:54. Ends at 29:21.
"charging stations are deactivated" Mark: *I'm gonna just ignore that*
28:54 😂
Freddy last episode: "The recharge stations are offline..." Mark this episode: "OF COURSE THEY PATCHED THAT" ... "Im gonna enter one of those recharge stations because I think that's how you get away from the moon man"
I always knew freddy would be the same as baby
Part 7 here we go
27:59 pretty sure this is why you came here
you had the right idea but doing that ending isnt the true ending
Freddy running past greg when he needed him most has me on the floor
28:35  FREDDY'S BETRAYAL
This entire play through has been Mark getting mad at the game for him not listening to the game's instructions lol
Dude, this ending is unsatisfying, I was expecting a bigger ending
"you.. are my superstar..." i started crying. its like kinda funny but really really sad at the same time
why did i actually just start crying
*Gregory in danger* Freddy: "Sorry Gregory, i have to go help Gregory🏃"
Good news. It is almost a c*ck
Mark : FREDDY!!! Freddy: got to wait for my turn
28:40 killed me the fucking most LMFAO
this game is so disappointing
Mark: *“FREDAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!”* Freddy: “I miss the part where that's my problem.”
mark screaming  FREDDY!!! continuously was the funniest thing ever.
"You wanna stay?- ✨Vanny ✨" I couldn't stop laughing why was that so funny?!
28:00 😹😹😹
The best part in this video it made me laugh 28:39
So... Is mark Markory like mark Gregory or what?.
The best part in this is at 27:55
are the sounds with the wet floor bots in game or added after? I cant tell
28:42
Mark: Click on them or I will come find you Me: Promise? ;0
17:56 SQUID GAMES ‼️
Mark:basic talking Moon:iTs PaSt yOuR bEdTiMe! Mark:Wha-uh-uhm- **dies**
Freddy's too nice, he waited for Monty to go downstairs first. 😭😭😭
You know, for a kid who just watched a weird bunny woman get ripped to shreds, he surprisingly clean. That ending should just have a sad and crying Gregory covered in blood while watching Freddy die, but no, he's sparkling with cleanliness despite the Vanny death and literally crawling in vents and trash.
I have just watched Hyper Droids timeline vid, turns out there are 7. different endings to this game
mark: *screaming for freddy to save him* Freddy, an empath, sensing he is in distress:
28:02
My name is Vanessa so it's kinda wired hearing mark yell at Vanessa 🤣😂
15:14
10:42
A
For thoses who cant find it here you go 28:02
31:40
Freddy really pulled a "when they needed him most... He disappeared"
“You are… my Superstar…”  *Uncontrollable wheezing*
Mark: I'm just gonna be riding inside of Freddy  Me:.....
I hate that at 27:47 he saw the security bot go up to that door yet mark went right in front of it, he could've avoided being caught by Monty 😭💔
omgggg the last part was AWESOME SHOUTING FREEEEEDDDDYYY😂😂😂😂
the best part of this whole vid is 28:40 😂😂🤣
Freddy: You are my superstar...  Mark: Wheeeeeeeze
15:30 someone please make that with the lego sounds it would be so funny
THE MOON REACHED INTO FREDDY AND SNAGGED OUT GREGORY
Mark got those Ariana Grande vocals
Markiplier: FREDDEEYYY FREDDYYYYYY FREDDY  *Gets killed* FREDDYYYY YOU BASTARD
27:57
The ending was so sad 😞 I was almost getting tears… it’s funny how you struggle about everything 😂
You serious? You serious? You serious? You serious? You serious? You serious? You serious? You serious? You serious? You serious? Also me: SHEeSH UPERDIEPOP
I love how after Markiplier did the Vanny ending he literaly 0.2 seconds after somehow came to the conclusion to immediatly discover the canon ending, his IQ is just too large for me.
I feel like when they made the game to begin with it was more linear, and they tried to open it up to give you more open options.
**F R E D D Y**
i love freddy
28:43 :  Mark : FREDDY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bet mark added the scene of Freddy being torn apart again at the end cause of Freddy abandoned mark
15:30 no way mans got jumped by stickman looking bots 💀
FREDDY RUNNING STRAIGHT PAST YOU I FUCKING LOST IT  SO MUCH FOR THE NEW EYES HUH
Mark: *high pitched screaming noises*  Freddy: Somehow, I am deaf
I AM SCREAMING AND SHITTING VANNY GOT FUCKING PULLED APRT!?!?!?!??!?
FREDDY FREDDY dont wait you turn
Plot Twist the moment the Clock hits 6:00 am freddy tells you he forgot its closed the next day
Fuck...poor Freddy. Why did you doom him mark..
Is hilarious that all he had to do was go left when exiting Roxy's room
I'm laughing so hard hahah ''FREDDY YOU BASTARD''
28:02 the best
28:30 🤣
Time stamp for the "FREEEDDDYY" scene
Mark Freddy is not broken, it seems like he goes specifically where you called him.
*Vanny and Freddy die* Mark: *Deflates*
i just realized the pizza plex is run by robots and they still choose to just throw the trash against the wall like that's not human laziness that's what they were programmed to do
28:00
28:39 number one top anime betrayals
lost it when freddy run passed mark ☠️
Markiplier: “FREDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYY”                 Freddy: *Let’s just pretend i didn’t hear that.*
27:59 😂
28:43 the moment why we are here
For anyone wondering  27:59
I feel like it's pretty obvious that Freddy comes, not to you but to the location you called him too. If you move, you'll have to wait until he stops and call again. This, in my opinion, adds to the horror by making it necessary to find a safe space to call Freddy because in the middle of a Chase he's just gonna run past you. Would the game be smoother if it was titanfall 2 style? Sure. Is it scarier that your only protection from Monty is able to run past you? Clearly. Is it extremely frustrating to get caught in a loop like Mark did here? Absolutely. But I'm not sure how a happy medium can be reached without destroying the horror side. Freddy can't follow you, that makes the game feel less scary with a massive body guard always behind you. Calling him to YOUR position is a LOT of internal coding that they may not have had time for.
Markiplier when gets jumpscared by other animatronics: Ohh come on!  Markiplier when gets jumpscared by a map bot: Jesus christ. My heart stopped for a second
It is almost a clock!
28:40 When you trying to find a toilet in an unknown place
I think that the Rooms that don’t seem to have a reason, like the theater. I think those are there for lore. Because 1 most of those rooms have bags in them with complains or stuff that had happend. And 2 because of how big the rooms are, no one would ever think that they put all that effort just for a little peice of lore which makes it the perfect place to put lore. So i think the per pose of those rooms is to not have a per pose and to trick the player into thinking it’s nothing (:
mark there is multiple endings  The good ending actually has william afton,....or.....atleast his remains-(his rotting corpse) fused with the springtrap in fnaf 3
that ending of this vid was hilarious XD
28:42 lol
I think the particles on the screen means that moondrop is near like ur screen when vanny is near u
Ok but the way Vanessa says go check the main stage
7:30 im dyingggg, mark
28:40 THE TRAITOR
Saddest anime deaths of 2021: Freddy fazbear
vanny kinda fine tho....
Mark:FREDAAAAAAAAAAAAY Freddy:it’s not my problem
Here's the screaming part for those who can't find it 28:41
Should have picked Leave after Vanny, since it likely meant a quick ending to observe. Though knowing Scott and FNAF overall, leaving probably would be the 'canon' choice.
28:02
"Im sure moon man got me because i got past 6 am" Its 5:54 am for me right now, wish me luck bois
At 28:40 I laughed so hard
AM I THE ONLY PERSON THAT CRIED AT THE VANNY ENDING WHEN FREDDY SAID “your my superstar” LIKE THAT KILLEDDDDD MEEEEE.
3:50 “Let’s begin by removing daddy’s face” OMILAWD-
It's stupid that moon can get you while your in freddy
5:00 and 28:03 for Freddy
Freddy-“I’m sorry little one”
Why does Gregory look like if Chris kratt and Martin kratt had a kid together
Editor changed?
28:21 Here's the timestamp to Mark's meltdown
Freddy: You are my superstar.  Also Freddy later: I’m gonna take back what I said.
THAT VANNY COMMIC ENDING WAS SO SCUFFED
Mark calling for Freddy like Cooper called for BT
Mark: FREEDDDDYYYYY! Freddy: yall hear sumn
come find me then lol
how about go fight monty frist then upgrade freddy?
Its the fact that Mark kept screaming "FREEEEEEEEDDYYYYYYYY" for me. That very funny to me. 😭👏🏽
not me crying bc of freddy at the end-
Mark: vanessa, vanessa, VANESSAAA!!!  Me: WHAT?! lol
The game feels unfinished kind of like Hello Neighbor, so much area to cover but super bugged
mark going this whole game without realizing that freddy runs to whatever location you originally pressed the button in
u should've went to the main stage
freddy failing to locate and save mark in the beginning was peak cinematic foreshadowing
*Mark screaming for Freddy*  Freddy: *” YOU’LL GET YOUR RENT WHEN YOU FIX THIS DAMN DOOR?”*
7:50 HIS NAME IS NOT MOON MAN ITS MOONDROPPPPP
You'd think he'd realize Freddy goes to the location he pings, not to him directly...
14:28 SOMEONE *NEEDS* TO ANIMATE THIS
I genuinely think the controversy with Scott caused a lot of things in this game to be put on hold or cut completely because a lot of the staff working on this game wasn't directly associated with Scott since he just produced this but didn't publish it but the ones who knew what was happening didn't like what Scott was saying/doing
Mark: FREDDAYYYYYYY Freddy: Yall hear sum?🐻🤨
"Maybe there was an issue in development". Uh yup Scott got canceled over some old tweet or something. Ugh cancel culture is the worst.
moon man can get you also in freedy
Where those butters 🧈 at?
28:42 Freddy be like: "ayo wassup how's the day ok gtg bye se ya xdxd"
29:25 I mean Freddy still belongs to those animatorics family right?🤣
The Freddy part clearly showing that, yes, Mark was right. We do enjoy his suffering.
Fnaf sb: *tries to make a (presumably) sad scene*  Markiplier: *YOU HAVE ACHIEVED COMEDY*
Bro when Freddy ran past him...   I can't breathe LMFAOOAOAOAIO
come find me
lol freddy left Hahhaa
This game looks like it sucks.
I'm crying I'm laughing so hard holy crap XD Freddy just blazing past Mark in his time of need HAHAHAHAHAH Save me XD
28:40 "get me in, get me in" - continues to run and ignore- XD that got me good.
flying potatoe made this first but I'm re-uploading so i don't have to scroll. jumpscare list!  3:33 Moon 7:28 Moon 10:45 Moon 12:23 Moon 27:52 Security Bot 28:26 Security Bot 29:13 Monty

28:43 lmaoo
love how we went from when Mark yelled Freddy that it meant a bad  thing to when he yells Freddy its a now a cry for help, character development
Freddy: “I forget the part where that’s my problem”
I cried because Freddy died
"Lead the way superstar." IS SO ADORABLE
28:42
“Right the bathroom the place Chica was eating” is absolutely horrid sounding out of context
The moment you guys were waiting for us at 28:42
Mark: *screaming at freddy to stop walking past him* freddy: not my problem buddy- 28:39 had me dying
9:25 why is vanessa kinda...
Lol
Baby
Good god these cutscenes are so damn abrupt
Mark: i didnt even start ye-  Freddy: GOOD NEWS! THERE IS A COCK
freddy running past mark is the funniest shi i’ve seen all week 😭
fredy fazbear was like oh nono dont do that !
At 14:14 I heard fanny XD

Mark: I will find you.... Me: **lives on a military base** HAH! Good luck!
You said that what happened
so after all this time mark didn't get that calling freddy but moving while doing so would confuse freddy amd not let him get to where he's supposed to be
27:55 watch until 29:14
good news! it is almost a cock!
FredBear: “*Your are… my… superstar*” mark: **AGRESSIVE WHEEZING**
Freddy: You are my super star. Markiplier: *sad wheezing* 17:58

25:03 he made the baby plush look like that awful funko one😅
Did he forget to use the fazer blaster against monty? Or could he not?
im out here crying during the vanny ending when freddy died and mark is just laughing LMAOOOO
17:50 not me crying here
The way that Freddy just hurried past mark was devastating
28:39
sick game
Gee, maybe you should've just freaking walked around in Freddie, then you'd have him when you needed him. Its almost like thats a very important feature of the game
27:55  I died  LMAO
27:51 Yes very funny   Mark: FREDDDDDDYYYDYDYYYYYYYYY U BASTERD Fredboi: Aww hes singing I will leave him alone. Hey Monty meet Gregory  *Waiting his turn* Mark: STFU GET OVER HERE AND LET ME IN HES GONNA KILL MEHHHHHH Mark again: FREDDYYYYDYYYYYYY GET TF OVER HER Fredboi: Don’t be rude to My bud Monty? He will take care of u *Still waiting his turn* MOnty:*Kills* Nope he sleeping dont worry bout it Freddy: ok I’ll go talk to chica while I’m waiting in line I’ll take him later Monty: (why is Freddy so stupid he’s our leader)
28:00
OH MY GOD! I literally was brought to tears of laughter when i was watching the intro sequence. I dont know why but "its ****'o clock" hit me right in my funny bone.
lmao i cant the end of this video has me dead
He really is stupid isn't he? He ignores important pop-ups, ques, gets lost super easily, overlooks simple things, forgets the literal power ups He got for Freddy, like CHICAS VOICE BOX TO FREEZE ANIMATRONICS...
27:59 HAHAHHAHAHA IM DYING THIS IS SO FUNNY
Just letting you know 'unnus annus' according to google now translates to 'one old woman' rather than 'one year' XD
28:36
27:50
The endings are so abrupt it feels bizarre
28:00 Come on freddy
Where is map bot when you need it?
Membe palau
Freddy is going to be Mark's villain arc
You have to only call freddy once and stay in the same spot you called freddy in.
17:58 to 18:08 XD!
27:49 for all
The sentence before you go to find a exit: "Recharge stations can't help you escape moon man." Mark: "I'm going to use this recharge station to escape moon man."
Dantdm crying bc fred died:NOOOOOOOOOOOOO Markiplier confused:what????
Pop-Up Instruction Card: "Remember, all recharge stations are now offline so continue carefully." Mark: I remember there being a recharge station behind Freddy's room-
the best way id describe this game is fnaf except it’s a weird resident evil game
27:53   The "FREDDY" scene stamped.
Oh I don’t 😟 yes I do‼️‼️ no I don’t 🤨😠 yes I do👹👹
me: drinks water  Mark in intro: Good news is almost a cock  me: spits out water on monitor   also me: gets mad at mark
Does the game ever tell you that in order to get rid of the Moon guy, you have to go to a recharge station? Mark wouldn't have died soo many times in this part if the game maybe made it clearer that's what you're supposed to do.
freddy is sent to the first place you called him. so clicking constantly just fucks you over
The way mark chooses one word and proceeds to repeat it for 2 minutes straight 😂
27:51 when I tell you I jumped 💀
Freddy running past mark and mark hitting the button while running away from the area he just hit the button in is very Thor of him
28:36  28:45 28:57 29:14 Look this in 2x i'm dead
- *Mark literally screaming for Freddy* - *Freddy running away from Mark* - *Mark ends up dying because Freddy didn't come* *Freddy* : "I am so sorry Gregory..."
Is no one talking about the fact Freddy full on DIED then appears out of nowhere again?!
THIS WHOLE TIME I WAS SCREAMING “OMG YOU DONT NEED FREDDY TO ESCAPE 🤦‍♀️
30:16 “i will find you” yeah like that one door
"FŘĘĎĐÆ 👹👺"
28:46 . thats it
Mark repeating the same words over and over in this episode INFURIATED me idk why
Yall are sleeping on *"YOU are my superstar.."*
-me crying at freddy saying "You are my superstar"  -𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗹𝗮𝘂𝗴𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 -me instant wheeze whit tears going down my cheeks

Freddy: You are my superstar... Meanwhile, Mark makes a pact with Satan
28:32 FREDAAAYYY
Mark: FREDDY *Freddy sees Mark being chased* Freddy: sorry Mark he's your problem now *Freddy runs by mark*
17:57 Freddy dies Mark: Did they run out of budget for the last animation?
Freddy's running is so funny  Also he goes to the location you first called him at, not to the player himself
End WHAT??? God this game sucks. Didn't know why Gregory was there until you try to leave. Random comic sequence with no explanation. This SUCKS
Has anyone else been arguing with him about just PLAYING THE GAME?! I love this man but MY GOD SIR
Does Mark  have the laser blaster?
When Freddie gets destroyed 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥲🥲
Just for myself to remember  18:31
Mark: "Come on Freddy don't wait your turn!" Freddy: no in fine thanks
I can already see Lixian  making a animation for this video
1:35  When your favorite show ends
RIP ears 😅
Mark: **unhinged screaming for Freddy to save him** Freddy: _”Recess’s Puffs Recess Puffs- eat ‘em up, eat ‘em up, eat ‘em up”_
28:40 is the best thing ever 😂😂😂😂
me when someone mention genshin impact: 27:30
27:57 the absolute funniest part of this video, peak comedy indeed
27:30 i feel like this has some meme potentials
Mark sounds like Chewbacca at  18:17
Freddy was trying to run a whole lap around the pizzaplex before trying to help Gregory
Good news! It is almost a c-
Security breach normally: 📚 Security breach if Greg just hid and slept somewhere until 6 am: 📄
I legit screamed no for the entire credits when I saw freddy die, I actually played the game
"I know, for some reason... you enjoy my suffering." I think you enjoy it more than us, Mark.
God this game is terrible
Since Vanny is most likely Vanessa, when she got disassembled by Greg her skin was probably violently tore open and her guts removed from her body, but weird to think that.
Mark screaming vanny over and over had big miss vanjie energy
Just complimenting near the end. maybe they are gonna bring out DLC to enhance and tell more about the backstory and all?
frefy
"FREDDY FREDDY YOU BITCH"
That ending made me burst into laughter but at the same time I'm so sad this game ended up like this
This is the first time I've been into FNAF but when Freddy was torn apart... I gasped and almost cried
Mark: *calling out Freddy in a panic* Freddy: I missed the part where that’s my problem
Anyone else got desperate when he ignored the fact they mentioned the recharge stations were not working
Please play One Night at Flumpty’s 3
So what was their intention.., to only get two parts for Freddy just for you to get to the end where you can’t use the second part? Or like make it so that the rest of the game is on super hard mode if you want to get collectibles and the third part, and if you die at all! You lose all that progress.., seems very dumb
Moon's voice remind me of Kollector's voice in Mortal Kombat 11
We enjoy your suffering?  You’re the one who enjoys suffering. You’re a masochist. Too bad I can no longer prove that since all video evidence is gone
Freddy:"Its time to go, Greogery" Gregory:"Vanny." Freddy:"Tf-"
0:10 I love Freddie's excitment, it look like he is high.
Not clicking on the links hoping Mark wil find me🥺👉👈
28:40 Freddy: tag your it Leaves mark for dead
So does Mark know there is 6 different ending?
Mark: If you don't click the links, *I will come find you.* Me: **doesn't click links just so I can meet Mark**
Mark: FREDDY!! Freddie: SHE A RUNNER!! SHE A TRACK-STAR!!
Freddy: You.. Are my superstar *ded* Mark: 🫖🫖🫖🫖🫖
That was really dumb
I keep getting mad because he won't use the scream upgrade 😭😭
i enjoy watching markiplier walk right past the obvious
😂
Because of this video, any time life offers me three choices, I will always go with Vanny
Markiplier: **screaming for Freddy to come to him**  Freddy: _Runs the exact opposite direction_
NO FREDAYYYYYYYYYYYY 💔😭
Freddy really said ayo f*ck that
Plz come find me daddy😋😋😋😛
Rip freddy ):
I love the fact Lixian added all the caution bot sounds xD shits funny.  Mark: oh hello 2 seconds later: *robotic noises*
i lost it at the beginning when he cut out the word 6 and freddy just became a gen z humor meme
"FREDDY YOU BITCH FREDDDYYYYY"  Freddy: *_*I don't know this kid*_*
omg i know that is the sadist ending but god dam mark i cant stop lauthing
Me : come on Freddy you know better than to wait your turn
I love how every time mark passes the yellow caution signs he says hi
Mark: FREDDY FREDDY FREEEDDDYYYYYYY!
Mark calls Freddy to A Freddy runs to A Mark has run away to B Mark: FREDDYYYYYYYYYY  Mark calls Freddy to B Freddy runs to B Mark has run back up to A  Mark: So this morning there was a patch and now Freddy is completely bRoKeN
An animation would be to brutal
The theater commercial is a nice touch. "Let's all go to the lobby. Let's all go to the lobby..."
So he realizes Freddy calls to the spot where you press Q....right? Like he doesn't home in on the player.
The one thing that really tips me off is the Whole Vanny animation, because it looked like Freddy had the claws, but you didn't have the claws at the time. It feels like the "Vanny" option was a developer thing so that they didn't have to go through the whole game to see that ending. But they added Dialog which makes it feel to me they just threw it in as an extra option.   Also personally the Vanny option was way too rushed, it tosses you right into an animation, you went no where to trigger it and the comic strip just felt underwhelming as hell that they couldn't even do a proper Death for Freddy there.
Evil Markiplier be like: I love Freddy
Make a comp of every time Mark says hi to those caution signs.
Guys, if they hadn't done the Vanny ending in a cheap comic book style, we'd have missed the credits through our tears. :')  Though I still need to see the actual ending, some games do half-ass bad endings to tell players they're wrong, basically. 😂
This game had sooo much potential but watching this play through makes it seem UNPLAYABLE. That Freddy disassembly scene followed by the comic ending literally made me laugh in disbelief. It was SO bad.   The glitches (Like Roxy not charging until Mark reset the game, or Freddy running right past him, or all the times the animatronics just disappeared and reappeared) coupled with the game progression path being so unclear at times is so disappointing compared to how intricate and pretty the world is.   And that’s not even factoring in the plot holes. Like how Vanessa left Freddy in the cylinder and then thinks nothing of it when he’s walking around again, and Freddy not wanting upgrades because he didn’t want to hurt his friends and then basically not caring as long as they were still functional (despite being almost totally destroyed, physically and seemingly mentally).
This game was so fun. I'm still gonna wait for the polished, zero bug patches even though i finished it already
17:50 awww Freddy
nearly cried when they dissassembled freddy
"im gonna be riding inside of freddy for the rest of forever"
😂😂😂 *Freddy runs pass Mark as he's screaming* Freddy you b!tch!!!
freddy's "it is my design" reminded me so much of will from hannibal
I love how he pauses to share his moments of realization that he's a dumbass 😂😂😂
So i have not looked ahead. The only knowledge i have of this game is watching Mark play it... But is this leading up to the bite of 87? No? Maybe? It does seem like it's flow is a little bumpy...
i love how he uses the part when the bots destroy freddy as an outro
God I love Mark but he literally destroyed the moment at the first ending
Could you pay me in advance? Mark: 11:34
Poor Mark. He seems to have had a worse time on this game than the other person I watched.
in the Vannie ending, u could see she was wearing some sort of costume, made of fabric and with stitches. I wonder what happened when she got disassembled......
28:38
I love how most of this video was just Mark screaming Freddy
Chicas ability could stun the moon man right
Not sure mark quite understands that Freddy heads to the area he called for Freddy not to him exactly, just to the point on the map he pressed the button and he won't go to the next point until he reaches the first so him spamming the button is actually hurting him lol
EVERYONE JUST GONNA FORGET THE START OF THE VIDEO HAPPENED YUP YOU CANT JUS MOV PAST THAT LIKE NTOHING HAPPEND??!?!??
Mark absolutely screaming for Freddy 28:39
28:00 - 29:19 had me laughing so hard
I really dislike the endings, they're not polished plus in that game there are a lot of buggs, this feels like early access but it's not
...huh?
0:38
They really pulled a Black Ops 4 zombies with the Vanny ending cutscene, damn
The Freddy theater has a secret door leading to sun’s room, where you get the start of a quest for a secret ending. It’s all a part of the plan mark, it’s all a part of the plan.
It really is amazing how Mark forgot the game has sneaking since he found the fazerblast
22:34 did he even notice the Circus Baby plush on the counter or not-?
I love how's it's a sad ending and he just laughs
Mark: *Screaming out for Freddy while Monty chases him*  Freddy: "I Missed the part where thats my problem."
How is Gregory not tired?,
Gregory, its time to go, tie your shoe lases. I dont have shoe lases. you- you dont have shoe lases? nu uh. are those- velcro staps? MATRERIAL GOWRL-
"You can left click to scream and stun other animatronics!" Mark: "I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that."
28:47 LMAOOOOOO
3:52 the captions read “daddy’s face” instead of “Freddy’s face” LMAO
mark is watching IN F E A R when freddy is dying
Maybe Vanny is only an option if u find her hideout
In the ever immortal words of Olivier from Chernobylite...this is just Groundhog Day in hell!
Mark"FREDDY!" Freddy"I missed the part where that's my problem"
Play inscription before I lose gravity
28:43 LMFAOOO FREDDY SOLD SO HARD LOLLLLLLLL
28:40 Mark: yelling to Freddy for help Freddy: “Aight, I’mma head out.”
The point of no continues. You know I hate them.
you can still use save points when you're staying
the start tho XDDDD 0:01
Loved every minute of it. I was laughing when you were screaming Freddy haha 😂 😂
Mark probably put in the security bots dismantling Freddie in the end of the video because of how pissed off he was at him for not coming to him in time in the game lmao
The ending needs to get an animation if someone animates this
29:15
28:43
i thought the comic book ending looked cool
Mark and all his screaming is hilarious. But what really gets me is thinking about what his wife must hear from other rooms of the house laughing to herself wondering what Mark is in a snit about.
He didn't do plan a
Goood news! It is almost a.... *CLOCK* Sorry, I'm a bear+rooster
28:43
Freddy is tired of your shit
Why didn't you use Chica's scream to deter the daycare animatronic?  (Edit) HOLY- *spits water* DID YOU HEAR THAT?! 21:57 after Mark says "claw upgrades". DID YOU HEAR THAT?! Golden Freddy..... not the giggle the robotic "aaaaaaaaaah" thingy!
was that Vanny ending rushed in 1 day? lol, that' so unfinished
got zamn vanny's hips are so fucking wide
freddy running past him and mark screaming in betrayal might just be the highlight of my year i'm on the FLOOR
does the Chica stun not work on moon boi
29:03
The can’t save feature sucks ass like bruh
28:40 I’m just imagining Amy downstairs like “👀 you good babe?”
FREDDYYYYYY YOUUUU BISSSHHHHHHHHH
He can come find me, it's all good :)
Mark: *high* *pitched* *screaming* Subtitles: A P P L A U S E
Game: The charging stations aren't working Mark: I'm going to go to a charging station
I feel like he doesn’t feel sad emotion , it’s just replace by confusion
freddy...f-freddy!FREDDEEEYYYY!!!FRED🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓🐓
28:32- 28:50 Mark: Freddyyyyy, FREDDAAAYYYYYYYY!!!! Security bot: Do you hear someone calling your name? Freddy: No, it's just the northern lights.
Fnaf  8  security breach part 7
freddy, sprinting: mark: [incoherent screaming] freddy, staring him in the eyes and continuing to sprint past: sorry mark u called for me over there lol
I know I'm a few days late in posting this but I feel like if Mark tried doing this in Deep Rock Galactic he'd probably complain about Molly too in this regard with the spamming
I was expecting there to be blood and limbs flying when they disassembled Vanny.
If he stopped running under and through places Freddy couldn't pass and spamming the recall button, Freddy might actually come in a much more reasonable time. However, I'm getting the feeling he's intentionally exploiting Freddy's path finding logic for drama.
Mark should’ve just tried to find a place to hide from Monty instead of trying to wait on Freddy 😂
The jump to the vanny cutscene was so jarring, they were definitely missing some sort of animation there to make it more smooth lmao
WHAT??? That ending was SO rushed and felt SO incomplete, I really wish they took more time on this game. They come out with a ton of games pretty close together which is good if you’re just sitting in an office chair. With free roam though, things cannot be rushed
STOP, YOURE MAKING FREDDY THE PERFECT KILLING MACHINE, YOURE ONLY MAKING HIM STRONGERRRD
"Good news! It is almost a -cock"
The Vanny ending: super sad- made tons of people cry. Mark: *Insults the budget of artwork ending *
the moon man jumpscares are really making me shit my pants
His reaction to that ending cutscene is by far the funniest thing I've seen this year every time I see it I just burst into a fit of laughter.. the confusion of what happened is so funny and idk why
Mark always guessing the lore is amazing
I like how Freddy just walk pass mark when he needed him it's just like freddy didn't care about him
my name is Vanessa and every youtuber has now said my name-
28:44 I don’t think that I’ve ever heard mark’s voice go that high pitched
Omg when freddy died I literally started crying nooooo
FREDDY YOU BASTARD !!
i'm sorry security breach, but that ending was so weird. I don't even know- it just felt not put together well and rushed? Just really out of place and brand for fnaf.
✨Sparkles✨😵
Mark:FREDDY HELP!!!!  Freddy:not my problem
Evidence Markiplier is illiterate
is Freddy ok from when he was diesembeld he doesn't look ok
Like in this comment if you want a unus anus to come back and put the emoji of ❤️ yes too
28:40 GOLD HAHAHA
Game: You can’t use charging Station after 5:30   Mark: *let me go to the charging station*
Marks fatal flaw is not listening to what the game tells him and then getting upset about it
the pacing of the “vanny” option SENT ME 😭
omg Mark STILL remembers that one message that said the meeting was on Thursday at 11:30, but couldn't remember the part of recharging stations being offline? bro-
*Mark: FREDDDYYYYYYY!!!!* *Freddy: I missed the part where that’s my problem.*
28:44 - Freddy: "I'll save you Gregory!" Gregory, still running from Monty: "I'm back here!!"
"Would you like to stay, leave, or Vanny?"
Freddy actually isnt broken, he runs to the point where you summon him, and will only respond to the next summon once he reaches that point.
Honestly I think the game was made and  polished but after play testing the original play style wasn't fun or engaging. But that just a guess knowing the developers history and public facing ideology.
18:25 we didn't even get like a proper introduction or closing to Vanny LIKE WHAT
Are you serious count: ♾
17:49 😪😪😭😭😭😢😢😢🤧🤧🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺😟😞😞😞😔😔😓😓
mark theres like 5 or 6 endings
“Did they run out of budget for the last animation- ahhahahaha” best Markiplier 2021 quote ever
28:30 is hilarious as mark is helplessly shouting Freddie’s name and Freddy just ignored him 🤣
7:43 mark: hi, that's me. So you may be wondering how I ended up in this situation-
28:42 oh God I'm dying I thought 5:08 was the best but then I saw when Freddy just yeeted mark on the stairwell...that killed me 🤣😂😂
28:13 Watch with subtitles and you will see it say [Aplause]
Yeah there had to have been an issue in development because in the main official trailer they made there’s a lot of stuff from there that was cut
The game was so good, so ambitious, but those endings were just sad. Now, this isn't bashing the artist because because art itself is great, but the comics really take you out of it and feel really off from the rest of the game. I went in excited to see the endings but came out thinking "what was that?" I've heard the devs ran out of time, so that explains it, but man, that was a pretty bad way to end such a hyped up game. I would have gladly waited another year for them to finish with proper animations for each ending.
Freddy: “Gregory you are my superstar” dies. Mark: shocked boi face.  A couple of seconds later  Mark:FREDDY YOU BASTERD!!!!!
Moon can get you in Freddy?

I legit started to slap my knee cackle when Mark kept yelling Freddy's name only for him to run past him and make Mark go: "FREDDY YOU BITCH!"
Freddy not coming to save mark was revenge for mark laughing at his death
See you guys in 2 or 3 years when we all binge watch the fnaf series
So did the devs run out of budget near the end why is it in comic form?
When Vanessa said go check the main stage it sound like she wanted to do the dirty with Gregory
Y'all I almost started crying when Freddy said goodbye  WHEN FREDDY DIED ;O;
5:09 best scene ever 🤣
19:20  Munkeplier
am i the only one that cried when Freddy died in the Venny option..?
Freddy: You are my superstar... Me: Hey you wanna see how hard I can cry! NJBHUGVYFCTDRXYCTFVGYBUHNJ
The funniest part
Freddy when mark doesnt need him: 🙋‍♂️ Freddy when mark needs him: 👨‍🦯
*Mark consistently calling out for Freddy's assistance*  Freddy: "I missed the part where that's my problem"
Those last few minutes of him proceeding to call Freddy, getting ignored, getting relieved at seeing Freddy, reaching impossible height with his voice because of Freddy running past him, being mad at Freddy for using his manners with Monty, and yelling at Freddy when Mark gets caught by Monty has officially made my week. Thank you.
This is the only fnaf that mark absolutely sucks at
I love how Mark is just yelling Freddy for 3 minutes straight and Freddy just said… nope you hurt my friends… screw you lol
I think they didn't want to animate Vanny being disemboweled because it's a human woman. But still, could have done that better.
28:00 in case anyone else wants to re watch Freddy betraying Mark over and over again:
I like how Mark is in genuine anguish calling out to Freddy and Freddy is just like  *"I missed the part where that's my problem"*
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation" 🤣
Markiplier: Click on the links in the description or I'll come find you!  Me: DO IT!
11:45   Padfoot: Actually... I am.
freddy: "i believe there is something more going on than just Vanny" Mark: **chooses vanny** **gets subpar ending** Mark: I KNEW VANNY WAS A SMOKESCREAN
not me crying over an animatronic bear from a video game
mark slowly loosing his mind on how many times he had to put freddys eyes in is tge funniest thing
27:55 - 29:21 This entire sequence of Mark screaming for Freddy will forever loop on my brain 😂💀
i think that freddy just goes to the spot that you first summon him from and if you aren’t there he goes to the next spot you summon him from and so on until he either catches up to you or you die
28:42 i swear im dead 😂😂😂😂 too much for me
Fanny looks like the other animatronic from special delivery
What was Freddy doing🤣🤣🤣
Mark: iM GonNa HoP iN a chArgINg sTaTion Me: THEYRE OFFLINE FOR GODS SAKE
6 endings
I know I did not just cry over an animatronic horror game
28:40, got me wheezing of laughter so hard i started choking to death, i was only drinking water bro.
mark: screaming for freddy freddy: 🏃🏃🏃
the moon is my fav scary character so far
If you shoot the staff-bot on the stage in the theater it gives you a "secret" achievement called "Heckler" lol
Watching this wondering if mark will ever realize that Freddy goes to the location you press the button at, not to Gregory himself.   [ boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop ]  < freddy screams in confusion >
Why do marks voice overs talk with the face of Seth Rogen when I close my eyes 😂
Nah, cause if it was me I’m getting out of there, threatening to sue the company unless they give me Freddy and a recharge station for him, and never going back (Although this place looks amazing and if they ever actually make a place like this irl I’m still going, I DONT CARE HOW OLD I AM!)
when Freddy said You’re my superstar it felt like iron man and i love you 3000
My theory is that Gregory is upgrading Freddy& it’s gonna turn evil

Oh hey congrats on 31M subscribers, I just saw it change
Mark: This is where Freddy detected I had an injury. I don’t know why he would think that, I was perfectly fine.  Me: Oh yea, nooo idea why he would do that. Maybe because he was hiding you from Vanessa? :0
shoosh  19:38
22:34 the circus baby doll just vibing like 😀🧎🏼‍♀️
28:42 Mark: Get me in, get me in- Freddy: 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️💨 Mark: FREDDAYYYYYYYYY  (I can't-)
Anyone else sob?
Wet floor bot is my fav new animatronic.  *inception bong* MY FLOOR IS WET
This game... Fucking... Sucks. Lmao
TURN ON THE SUBTITLES FOR 3:50 ITS SO FUNNY
Mark gets asthma at 17:58
The way Vanessa says go check the main stage
_"Did they run out of budget?"_   No, they spent their time obsessing over the pizzaplex that they neglected every other aspect of the game. Which is incredibly frustrating because there are points in the game where it is very good but is immediately let down by _everything_ else.
He really forgot that he has Chika's voice box
By the way, moon can see you while you are in freddy, and guess what? He teleports to your location when the clock strikes the hour!  Also, the clock specifically states: 6 : 00 am is approaching! All of the recharge stations are offline for the hour.
I enjoy how Freddy just decides to wander around aimlessly and confused as mark screams at him
25:00 Mark, remember that Scott quitted the project at half develpment and then other team finished the game adding other things (hence the delays)
Freddy while the screen has a dark blue haze with stars kinda screwing with your vision: "I love these new eyes, I can see so much better with a new aray of colors!"
I dont think I will ever stop sobbing at Freddy saying  "you are my superstar.." 😭😭
First of all, im glad his old intro is back. Second of all, the way he screamed freddy at the end when he just ditched him was hilarious
Everyones talking abt how mark was screaming “FREDAYYYYY” but no ones talking about how he was like “VENESAAAAAAAASS” edit: ty for 1.6k likes!!
"You can left click to scream and stun other animatronics!" Mark: "I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that."
Mark: *desperately calling out to Freddy while spamming Q* Freddy: That ain’t my problem, pal.
I love your videos so much they bring me joy when I'm down♡
mark:FREDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY  freddy: i got places to be
17:48
Mark laughing at the end of the Vanny part while I was crying because Freddy was done made me cry harder
"In memory of our friend, Mike Hoffman" (end screen) Did someone die while in the making of this game or is the game based off what happend to Mike I'm confused someone educate me please
Lmaoo nice play through but this game is DOGSHIT 😂
“I know that you for some reason enjoy my *suffering* ” 👹👹👹👹👹👹
5:32
did anyone see that when freddy was giving the choice for the first time we could (i think) see vanessa walking in the background
I like how Freddy just walked behind Monty
not me crying rn
literally like outlast 1 i like it
Just like whoops not enough budget! Better use a comic.
Best Christmas binge ever
the staff bot around 28 SCARRED THE SHIT OUT OF ME SOMEHOW
Hey Mark, just so you know if you pick up the damaged staff bot head you can save while continuing to explore the pizzaplex. Just a little tip I learned from watching 8BitRyan’s playthrough. Can’t remember if you have to repair it or not though
NOOO YOU KILLED FREDYYWDJHDHJAKJHD
Freddy: “no monty go ahead I insist, I am in no hurry.” :3   Monty: “well thank you.”  _ripping it down the stairs to dismantle greg_
does mark no realise freddy goes to the spot the call button was pressed?
That end screen is terrifying
Mark screaming at Freddy gives me the will to return with the milk  28:00
This game Is so beautifull but Scott could do Better, because the potential this game have Is soooooooooooo big
Stay Leave VANNY.
lol if you pause on the news papaer article read it
What happened  ] nightcore 🥺🥺🥺🥺
Freddy: I finally got new eyes Me thinking he’s not blind anymore  Ten seconds later  Markipilier: come here freddy Freddy: now where is gregory Me :Yep he’s still blind
I think Vanessa is purple guy's kid
They killed Freddy!  You bastards!
Mark calling Freddy over is like watching your Uber eats driver on the map
Mark: FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYY! FREDDYYYYY HELP MEEEE  Freddy: Must've been the wind 🧐
When mark was running from monty and Freddy ran pasted him was hilarious 😂
ok first of all, Vanny "ending" is stupid as hell and shouldn't even be in the game. it seems like something they were planning on but scrapped, forgetting to take it out of the finished product, just like many other things that make no sense in the game. second, WHY WOULD YOU NOT PICK LEAVE ?!?! it's the whole point of the game so why not see that ending? you saw Vanny ending, yet you didn't go for LEAVE ending before deciding to stay. i mean big brain seems to be small brain, Mark. see all other endings before exploring the "real" one. third, WHY didn't you just stay in that little alcove and behind the stairs and waited for Freddy to come to you after passing Monty coming down the stairs?!?! i love ya man, but you just... sometimes... sigh...
But did they run out of budget for Vanny ending? Why'd it look like a comic strip?
28:41 Freddy is like screw this i'm out.
This game is honestly so ganky, they really should’ve finished the game before they released it
Is there an animation of this end part yet?
I'm not gonna lie when freddy died I kinda cried
Where is Freddy going!?
I know im back seat gaming but cant u just ride freddy till the entrance?
I feel and for Freddy when he got dismantled but that was brutal
Monty is chasing Mark: panik   Freddy is coming: kalm  Freddy runs right past Mark: FREDAEEEEYYYYY
i really wish we got to see more of vanny, she chased you for 2 scenes, then got riped to shreds
WHY DID FREDDY DITCH YOU LIKE THAT WTH
come fine me mark
Freddy waiting his turn 🤣😂
My favorite bit has to be the caution robots *boom* sound anytime Mark looks at them.
28:40
Freday sounded like FREEEEEAYYYYYY
man this game is kinda dog shit isn't it?
Freddy goes to The exact spot where you Pete the button so if you move after pressing the button we will not come to you
"You are... my superstar" This is where men cried. If you didn't, you have no feelings
Chicas beak? Nah. Bhicas Cheak
I actually cried to this what the hell
Why where the charging stations all of a sudden working again after Freddy or Vannessa or whomever told them that they weren't after the eye upgrade. Is it because Mark made it to 6 am?
I feel like we kinda skipped over the fact that they disassembled Vanny, a HUMAN. I feel like if they had a whole scene for it then it would have been really grotesque and the screams would be pericings as a human gets ripped to shreds by robots.
26:06
Freddy: runs into Gregory Also Freddy: "Hello have you seen my Gregory?"  runs away
28:58 Monty lost him, he could have hidden in the bathroom and waited for Freddy to come to him. Instead he goes into the open, knowing Monty would be there because he saw him go down the stairs moments earlier
material gwroll✨
28:44
11:40 triggered my siri
The bots disassembling Freddy was the creepiest part of the whole game. They should have animated the rest of it..
Do u need water 🤣 17:56
18:01 💀💀💀💀
they gave freddy the AI of molly from DRG
f
i missed part 7,8,9 and 10 now i gotta chase everything before mark upload a new one
Everyone *being emotional because of freddy*  Nobody  Mark: what did they run out of badget? 17:58
Bruh im high and that bs scare at 10 min gave me a heart attack
What the hell is he talking about at 18:40 about vanny, I’m only hearing nonsense. Or I just don’t get it😅
I mean... I don't really think it has to be said, but the call Freddy button brings Freddy to the spot you called him at, it's not designed to follow the player. So running and mashing the button is just creating halt points where Freddy keeps running and stopping at. You can see this when he is called and runs passed the player. That does not make it any less funny when you're frantically running from 9 security bots and Monty though xD
Was it just me… or was Vanessa’s “Go check the main stage…” a little sultry 😂😂
28:40 _Freddyyyy you bitch_ 🤣
"ii think the games changed a lot" .... kinda what happens when your family is doxxed for your thoughts and your forced to leave the world you have spend DECADES making because some people are thin skinned trolles
It's really bad game design that at the start of the game, Freddy tells you the best way to the exit is through the staff tunnels, but then at the end of the game, you're unable to reach the exit through the Staff tunnels.
"FREDDAAAAYY" Freddy: learn your manners. no shouting *runs cutely*
This games development is so similar to cyberpunk:2077 it's funny
the amount of times the game has given mark the information he's needed but he doesnt absorb it and leads himself down a sinkhole of despair trying to figure out what the game already told him to do, is out of this world.
F for freddy :(
Mark: "Freddddyyyyyyyyy!!!" Freddy: ykw I'm on break sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo "runs past Mark"
Bruh the intro tho lmaoaoaooo
28:43 mark got betrayed by freddy 😂😂😂😂
7 episodes in and mark still didnt realize that freddy runs to the spot you pressed the call button at, and not to you directly...
Mark I have listened to every episode of distractible at least ,5 times
I LAUGHED WAY TOO HARD WHEN MARK NEEDED FREDDY AND HE LITERALLY JUST RAN PAST IM CRYING
I just wanted to say thank you to Mark because I was stranded in an airport for the past 2 days without any money and these videos really helped me laugh and pass the time which I really appreciate! Amazing videos and thank you so much Markiplier!!!
I'm flabbergasted at the swing in quality and polish this game has. The levels and starting cinematics are amazing, but the gameplay bugs and that comic ending was just laughable.
God, this game is a whole new tier of shit.
Guys I have a question! Did Mark name his dog after the fnaf Chica? Or is this just a coincidence?
"Did they ran out of budget,for the last animation?"                                                   -Markiplier
It’s been 7 episodes and Mark STILL does not understand how Freddy works when you call him
The Daycare Theater IS a vital area IF you picked Monty Golf instead of Fazer Blast earlier Mark :)
Mark: Freddy. FREDDAAYYY here get me in here! Freddy: Y'all hear sum? 🤨
I believe the comic endings are like that on purpose. Cause if you notice, the Afton ending is animated. And I believe the Afton ending is the only animated ending. So maybe the comic endings are just different endings you can get where the animated ending is the true ending.
So your sayimg that you refuse it to be the end and continue toruture🤨
MARRRKKK PRESS Q TO CALL FREDDY, PLEASE XDDD YOU HAVE NEVER CALLED FREDDY BEFORE!!! DO YOU AGREE WITH ME??? LIKE THIS COMMENT THEN MARK WILL SEE IT!!!      XDDD IM IN TEARS XDDD
I can't be the only one who gets prey vibes from this game!?
Not me crying over Freddy lmao
My favourite part of Mark trying to make a point of "red hare-ring" out of "red herring" is that he only goes on to point out "red eyes" and completely drops the "hare" thing.
Okay, Imma say it. I've tried to give this game a chance, but after that comic, I have to say it:   This game is a shitshow.
kinda find it funny how in the 19 min mark explains there's more to the story than we know and I'm like I mean it's pretty obvious 😂
29:17 Watch this out of context LMAOOO-
That turn them against vanny was so good
i think he refuses to say that he's seen videos bout it
Honestly I was really hoping vanny was vanessa but that vanessa was actually a s.t.a.f.f bot that went haywire and that the entire place was taken over and owned by bonnie and foxy- and that bonnie took vanny on as a prodigy but foxy was against it (hence the letters about the boss wanting her to become a security guard and the writer not) overall lots of theories
What happened lol
“You are my superstar” gets me every timeeee
28:37 Dont mind me
He keeps calling it to a spot he immediately leaves
Omg,I just imagined something that would make this living h3ll,what if balloon boy was in here? 😃✋ There’s no way you would not rage quit if he just took your batteries
Gregory: "The disappearances will keep happening...." Bruh when did he ever learn or hear about disappearances- like if he knew and was worried WHY would he go there, if he knew why would he CRAWL INTO ONE OF THE KIDNAPPING ROBOTS LIKE I 100% THINK THIS KID IS EITHER HELLA SHADY OR THE GAME IS SOME KIND OF ACTUAL DREAM/NIGHTMARE THAT SUNDROP PHYSICALLY REPRESENTS LIKE THE OVER-BEAR-ING FRIENDSHIP MIXED WITH THE TOXICITY AND SGJSHDJSJ SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AND 'VANNY' CHOICE ANSWERED NONE OF THEM???? anyways, love the series as far in as I am, fully prepared to see the rest now after that little rant!!
Did anyone else spot a plush baby in the background?
Is anyone else sad that freddy died
Bro I got so sad when i seen what happened to freddy
"Gregory... you are my superstar" me: hey check out how hard i can cry
I'm literally ganna cry right now
okay but like Vanny was stitched up nd not an animatronic?
What would be an azzy thing to do would be that the whole point of the game is to exit the building, BUT, PLOT TWIST, you end up dying and there is no actual way of making it out alive.  And why can that moon guy harm you, if you are in Freddy? You would think Freddy would be protecting you
THE LORE HAHAHAHAHAHA
With 5he recharge station th8ng freddy did say that they were dis@bled so they WONT WORK
Markipoo it has been a while since you've made me wheeze this hard, to the point I was crying and woke everyone up at 2am. I loved it, cuz I am so dying typing this message xDD
i’m sorry but this part was so infuriating lmfao
Holy shit. The studio Scott hired had no fucking idea what they were doing, did they?
The injury that Freddy detected is the reason Gregory is wearing a band aid on his cheek the entire game. Just if anyone is curious.
I have a whole new appreciation for Freddy after watching this
MARK: exploring constantly THE DEVS: that’s not yet mark  Mark: imma explore the story before I’m suppose to and break the game
the way mark loses his sanity during the gameplay is so funny
Gosh I love it when he screams Freddy 😂😂😂😂
That right there is a cute win
''Freddy'' Mark exclaimed calmly
18:05 😂😂😂
Mark: *irritably dismisses popups telling him what to do* Yes, I KNOW how that works  Also mark: *ignores the warning that the recharge stations are down* I distinctly remember being safe in these.
Freddy you bastard lol
he comes to the spot that you are standing in when you call him, so if you walk away AFTER calling him he wont come to YOU. He goes to the spot you triggered him. If you spam the call button while he's already on the move he wont teleport to you are reroute, he'll keep trying to go to the point of the map where you summoned him. Go to a safe corner and wait for freddy/open area for him to charge to without getting stuck because of his pathfinding.
Watching Mark play this game really sometimes gives me aids. There are just so many things that he forgets or does wrong and oml im gonna die XD
mark : FREDDY! FREDDY!  subtitle : [Applause]
I've never laughed so hard at a markiplier fnaf video before the end where Freddy just kept running right past him😂😂
Freddy: Gregory… you are my superstar..  Me: FREDDY *sobs* I LOVED YOUUUU
oh my god when he was being chased by monty I was dying laughing
i like how freddy was jus5 t walking behind monty while mark is dying
I started crying when freddy said you are my superstar
30:04 Darkiplier!!!!!! YES! 😃
Why does Mark feel the need to repeat the same thing a dozen times or more? He’s always done it so I guess it’s part of his “humor”?
15:21 Vanny kinda cute though
what if i want you to find me mark
At 28:42  Freddy: Don't worry, I'm coming Gregory!!! *Runs way past Gregory*  Mark: FREEEEDAAAAAAIIYYYY!!!
At 28:41 I lost it
Mark just walks by gifts like most people breathe.
Why does Freddy’s voice sound like diavolos
Currently balling my eyes out, i know there is another ending thats happy but this is still so sad, watching a friend die right in front of you? Damn bro
oh my god. Hearing Markiplier rage like that in 29:16 is just too hilarious. I can only imagine that his neighbors (if they can even hear him) are probably wondering who the hell Freddy is and why Mark is yelling at him.
mark:FREDDY WHERE ARE YOU GOING Freddy:Nah ima go talk to monty and let him know greg is gonna rock his shi
Mark: “Freddy I need you!” Freddy: *Runs by* “Macaroni, Macaroni, Macaroni, Macaroni, put the cheese in the noodles, what do you get?”
10:34  Wait… what just happened???   Ok, I’m assuming that Moon is like the most buggiest, weirdest animatronic in the game.
Freddy reminds me of my horse in RDR2
18:26 Like i was literally staring, GAPING, so confused as to what that ending was- like WOW I was left speechless.
When Freddy told Gregory to leave without him because if he left the place, he would need a machine to keep him alive, I lost it when he said, "I will miss you." I started crying along with the sad music at the end when he was reading the book.
I love how the entire time Markiplier is just ignoring the fact that the wet floor signs or whatever are making the golden Freddy noise lol
The first ending would be sick if it was animated
The last few moments in the video had me in stitches
I'm impressed that Mark has put up with this game for this long. If it weren't an official FNAF game, he'd be shitting on it the whole way through and probably wouldn't have played 10% in. But alas, it seems like games nowadays just aren't made the same as they once were.
Marks reaction to Freddy’s death and that scene sent me to the moon
Mark's pain is our entertainment. Thanks mark!
"I know that you...for some reason...enjoy my suffering."...I MEEEEAAAANNNNNN....you do make it very entertaining. XD
Everybody: "Oh my god just release the game already I need to play it ahhhh!" Steel Wool: "Okay here's the game, it's not finished yet" Everybody: "Nooo why didn't you finish the game???"
i think mark forgot its five NIGHTS at freddys
Mark, i have never been to cloak, listened to distractible, visited or ordered your merch from your merch store from back in the day, etc. if you come get me, my only request is you Vanessa style jump scare me, before beating me to death with the flashlight. Thanks!
Bro, when you hit key to call Freddy, that's where Freddy Go, if you keep running and spamming key, he has to catch up to your spamming of the button -_-
“they patched that!” (freddy auto existing in the charging station) yeah no they didn’t 😳 i accidentally discovered that glitch today and duplicated freddy and got soft locked 👻
28:40 I almost died at this part
Almost made me cry
30:20
Did I see Freddy as a father figure in this game? Yes. Did I cry when he “died” yes. Am I going to get over it, no. No I will not
I didn’t click on the links. Come and find me mark
Mark’s hands look so much like my hands that when he was clapping after the “Vanny” thing, I felt the sensation of it even though I wasn’t moving
Regardless of what really happened in development, Mark's analysis of it is exactly how I feel. Some moments are incredibly polished and fantastic, but the inbetweens are ill-fitting and even disorienting at times. Some of it is the sheer number of bugs (I know it was just released, but the amount makes it seem rushed for deadlines...) but most of it is the awkward pacing.   I don't think I've felt both this positive and negative towards the same game since No Straight Roads. The love and effort is there, and those good moments are SO GOOD, but the rest is a little embarrassing.
Ran outta ink too, didn't ya, you bastards.
Nice.
28:00 is where the FREDDAY starts, 28:18 is new voice levels reached lol
Anyone else not clicking those links just in the hopes that markiplier actually does come and find them?
Freddy screwing Mark over is absolutely *GOLD* !
Uhm. Not even Tony Stark dying hurt me like this. NOOOO FREDDDYYYYY!
Plot Twist: Gregory was already dead so Freddy didn't see him. Monty's sunglasses were advanced, so he could see Gregory's ghost.
WHEN FREDDY WAITED FOR MONTY ON THE STAIRS WAS SO CUTE AND MARK JUST SCREAMING AT HIM I COULDNT STOP LAUGHING
I mean, did they run out of budget for the entire game? Because it was all pretty fucking bad.
11:05
Algorithm.
28:16 best chase ever
Mark: about to die   Freddy: "here lemme hel- SIKE help yourself 🖕"
Freddy: *dies* Mark: *laughs*
Freddy putting his hand on Gregory’s shoulder has me kinda emotional?? best Freddy so far
One think you never caught onto that annoyed me, freddy goes to where you called him and not to you directly. So spamming the call button gives him 50 stops, and none of them are going to be on you if you're moving.
Mark: (contemplating were to find the exit) if only the game had an option to open up a map anywhere you want, like on a little watch.
2:10  YOU SEEM TO BE WHAT?
FREDDDAAAAHHHHYYYYYYY
The most amazing thing I've noticed is that you're supposed to stay put to call Freddy, so he'll come to you; If you call him and walk away, he'll run to the place you called him, so Mark spamming Q must've confused the A.I a whole lot on where the fuck to go to.
I feel like the cutscenes have a lot of potential but the transition to them is absolute garbage. This is so incoherent
The YouTuber was too stunned to speak
All I can do is imagine Amy sitting in the living room sipping some coffee and hearing Mark scream at the top of his lungs for Freddy.
27:53
Mark: “FREDDAYYYYY- here get me in here!!” The Mood: "Let me in, LET ME IN!!!!!!" Monty: "Chica, hold my Mystery Mix. I'm gonna end this man's whole career."
When the ending was low budget  Mark:What... Did they ran out of budget to make a better ending
Oh my god 😭 I’m like actually crying 17:45
A YTP style intro!?   I love it!
6:53 theres a check point 🤠
Freddy:  who’s yelling? Mark:  FREDDY WHERE ARE YOU I NEED YOU Freddy: I gotta use the bathroom 😥 Mark: oh Freddy here cmere Freddy:  GET MONTY HE’LL HELP, I GOTTA GO Mark: FREDDY YOU BITCH FREEDDDY Freddy:  Oh hi Monty! Freddy: wait.. *heres jumpscare*    Me: What a true superstar  28:36
28:15 please someone animate this
And when the world needed him most, Freddy vanished.
Mark: *beep boop* *beep beep boop* Freddy: Good News! It's almost a cOcK 🐓
It really seems like, in some ways, they bit off a bit more than they could chew with this game. It seems like in this case, less could've been more.
Me scrolling through the comments seeing every comment have like 200 likes: 👁👄👁 Hi
that intro. "freddy: good news, it is almost a cock." lol
Mark: "Are you serious?"x? Me: *nodding violently*
How Freddy ignored mark and continued to ran away cracked me up 28:42
28:06 onward, just pure pain.
23:17 “chics name shirt!” *caution sign* “he- hi…….👁👄👁”
ok why does this say it was uploaded today. when it was uploaded 2 days ago? And a few hours ago was part 9.....? Youtube bug maybe?
I love the fact that the game wants to be finished but mark will keep forcing the last 10 minutes he has left for doing just stupid shit except finishing the damn game Lmao
Mark: FREDDY! FREDDY! FREDDY!  *freddy running passed him*  mark: FREDDY YOU BI**H!!!!
Mark: FREDDY! FREDDY! FREDDY!  *freddy running passed him*  mark: FREDDY YOU B***H!!!!
Not me wanting you to come find me 🤷‍♀️
I like how it took mark about 30 tries to escape but when i did it it only took me 2 attempts  🤣
*Monty on his way to kill Mark* *Freddy:*  “Oh woah, gotta wait my turn” :3
You had problems finding the door. You’re not gonna find fuck all.
23:25
Way To Go Superstar! Yo-u are my super-star.        Deep Down we are *always* Freddy's Superstar! ❤❤❤❤❤ 🧡💛💚💙💜🖤
I think if you had a little bit more patience and didn't just push the call freddy button over and over you would have more success
Man mark, you're fun and all, a great guy, but being honest there are times when I want to mute you lol. Cool playthrough though!
Mark at 7:45 repeating "What happened?" Ad nauseum.  Me: Did... did the Vashta Nerada get to you there Mark? *Random disembodied digital voice* Markiplier has left the library. Markiplier has been saved.
2:12
So are we hoping an animation of Mark just yelling at Freddy? Yes?
Question, why isn't Mark using his items? He's got to have the Chica voicebox and either the blaster or camera by this point, shoot Moon in the face with them
My geuss is that he is upgrading him and then he is gonna go roge and be the scariest most upgraded mother fucker
Oh my god poor freddie that was terrifying
mark about to die: *FREDDY!* Freddy: hold on a second I need to do my cardio oh hey Monty!
Mark: "I will find you" me: ... Should I invite my brother-in-law over? He knows how to make korean food
Freddy : "you are my Superstar" **me getting a little teary eyed** Mark: "HHHHJHHHPWRIHGIROHW DID THEY RUN OUT OF BUDGET FOR THE LAST ANIMATION?!?!" Me: "DAMNIT MARK"
FREDDDDDDDDDYY!!
Im dying of laughter
"Freddy you b*tch! FREDDYYY!!!"
Freddy: dies Mark: wheezes  Me: cries
*POTENTIAL FLASH WARNING ⚠️
6:50
Vanessa: *Go check the main stage~* Me: 😳 *Mommy?*
good news! it is almost a cock!
I gotchu mark. 7:43
28:40 Freddy just runs past mark to make him angry 😂
Is it just me or is Vanny kinda looking a bit hot... and also when Gregory said the bots to dissemble Vanny  I immediately thought about nudity.... send help
Mark : oh  hi slippy sign caution thingy : *haaaaaa* 23:19
So what I think is that they did the comic for vanny disassemble is because it would be SUPER GORY
0:05
2:43
Freddy is the SINGLE funniest thing in this game.
I'm crying omg wtf is the Vanny ending, no I don't like it
THE LAST BIT WITH MONTY WAS SO NERVE-WRACKING OH MY GOD "FREDDYYYYY YOU B*ASTAAARRRDD"
FreddYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
This game honestly looks really poorly made, like come on.
7:29 w a i t w h a t
"Nothing can hide from me now" - except basically everything can minus the collectables...
28:00
Mark was right on point with his analytics of the game's design. I've heard that Scott left during development some of the way through and they had a quick plot change before release, or something like that. Had things gone differently, maybe it wouldn't have been such a shaky release. I'm sure they're still working on it and improving, especially since it feels like the game is in early access, but for now this is what we have. Just gonna take some time.
Mark: FREDDY I NEED YOU  Freddy: Runs past Mark
I hate this game and I haven't even played one second of it.
Freddy: charging stations won’t work during the last hour until doors open  Mark: why won’t these stations open?? It must be a bug!  Seriously why does he never listen to audio
devs: *tries to fix exploits so people cant open level 10 doors also devs: *literally breaks freddy*
Haven't seen Mark lose his mind this much since the Minireenas in Sister Location.
The red Hareing is so smart
‘I will come find you’ well if you have the same path finding as Freddy then that isn’t too big of a threat lmao
That was the cheapest ending I’ve ever seen lol
11:28 It did say that the recharge stations don't work right before 6am... which is beyond stupid, because I'd make an actual reason than, "yea... no charging now, because we want the game harder, but give no reason why."
5:30 when Freddy is actually zoro
Technically this is one night at freddy's
"you tried to trick me!"  I believe proper phrasing is you succeeded in tricking me last time!
12:45 "You LYING.... HORSE!"  XD
Mark: *Screaming FREDDY in panic, scared shitless* Freddy: "I'll ignore that."
Couldn't even animate a real ending lmao this game.
Vanny ending was trash 😂
29:18 😂😂😂😂😂
Nice
27:50 - 29:20 got me laughing so hard 😭😭😭😭
*The quality of this ending reminds me of the anime ending of The Promised Neverland*
mark screaming for freddy is the funniest shit XD
when he said "you are my superstar" I AM GOING TO CRY
When the credits are playing I could hear mark from the surgeon simulator " LOREEEEE "
🎤
I think they ran out of budget shortly after chicas sequence
That fucking jumpscare 😂👏🏻
done
The vanny ending seemed kinda lazy in my opinion.. idk the other fnaf games are just better to me. Security breach is still interesting but like… what…?
1 ending out of like 5-6
28:41 LMAOO WHEN HE RAN AND HE NEEDED HIM HE MOst
Yeah….Vanessa’s reward isn’t DIRECTLY on the main stage. It’s on one of the tables on the side of the stage near it, and you need Freddy’s Roxy vision to find it.
Mark REALLY needs to learn that if you want Freddy to come to your location, press it ONCE and then wait for him. If he spams the Freddy call button, the AI will keep trying to come to the newest ping location which resets Freddy moving every time that happens. Press once and WAIT for him.
Mark: *is trying to escape Monty and is repeatedly calling Freddy to attempt to help to do so* Freddy: *literally goes past him and bumps into Monty* "Oh, no no, sir, after me, I insist" Mark: *aaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH-*
Anyone know why the animatronics are aging so quickly
So is it natural for big YTers to just not pay attention to a game after like ten MILLION fails after not reading or actively listening to the dialog? Lol
I outright CACKLED when Freddy ran right past Mark and Mark just screamed.
it said last episode that the charging stations were turned off
Someone needs to animate the freddy screaming parts xDD
Bro i died laughing in the beginning when it was fast forwarding and made it seem like freddy said "COCK🐓" 😂😆😂😆
Anybody else love the forensic file narration whenever mark is explaining his mistakes.
You haven’t found me yet
He kept trying the least direct path lol
Freddy at his last breath ✨you are my super star✨ Mark 🤣😥🤣😥🤣😥🤣🤣🤣
Vanny is a bit y'know...
I just wanna say, I love how you started the video😂
14:27 LMAO PLEASE
1:36 well I think maybe it’s you can escape now or continue the story because we haven’t beaten monty yet… Vanny still running around… 9:30 how is she talking directly to us now… hmmm 10:15 😂😂 13:26 damn… :( we will miss you Freddy 14:54 damn this is kinda sad.., the way he says he’s aware of what’s happening and there’s nothing he can do…. and he will miss us 15:22 :( 15:30 WTFFF 16:08 probably tbh 16:50 OH SHIT FREDDY MEANS BUSINESS LETS GOOOO 17:54 noooooo :( 18:11 I uhhhh guess so lmfaooo 28:40 😂😂
FREDDYYYYY YOU BASTAAAAAARDDDDD.
Monty's speed is on another level
is nobody gonna talk about how the link has "bruh" in it
one of my favorite things about Mark's playthrough is his almost constant need to make things harder for himself to the point that the Mark editing has to cut in Kuzco style and call himself dumb or point out the flaws to his gameplay
Did Mark just laugh at Freddy's death
It took me a while to realize that the noises with the wet floor sign bots were edited in
when moon popped up i was drinking my coffee and i slammed my two front teeth into my cup so hard😭😭
Freddy really said: go little rockstar 🧚‍♀️✨💖
SO THERES NO EMOTION TO FREDDY BEING RIPPED APART?! ALRIGHT
SO THERES NO EMOTION TO FREDDY BEING RIPPED APART OKAY
10:31-10:48 This game is so buggy that it makes the jumpscares scarier
When was it said that saves don't work after staying?
Mark is bad with directions.
11:23 finally
Watching Dawko and MatPat understand why there are all these options and understanding connections and then there’s Mark and it’s like “sir half of you questions were answered in the gameplay sneak peaks and also you played VR please remember” I absolutely love it this has been a blast lol
who told mark that repeatedly shouting was entertaining because id like them to die
Everyone: Complaining about Scott making a buggy unfinished game  Me: Knows that he retired after people were doxing him because of who he donated money to, when that's his business, and endangering his family.
whatever morals you have remember that Freddy asked monty about his day when he was trying to kill Gregory: Monty: Trying to kill Gregory Freddy: "So how's your day been? "
I do agree with the comment about stuff missing. It feels like that so much was planned but scrapped at the end to be able to publish it. There is like one real bossfight, if you don't count the fazerblast section. And the theatre is too developed to be just there? Also the mall looks too abandoned and under construction in some places. Or the many arcades in this.. I love this game and how the animatronics have different personalities but I cannot wait for future dlc and hope that stuff gets added to the main game. The beginning felt too rushed too. I get they maybe wanted to stay true to the show dont tell of the old games, but they coulve gone bonkers with cutscenes etc. It shouldnt stay true to formular anymore.        Also one certain character couldve been left out for good imo.
The Vanessa calling you to go on the stage is either  1] not coded in or  2] is just a ploy to let moon get you
THE CAPTIONS NOOO “let begin by removing daddy’s face.”
this cant be the end. me seeing how the episode is 30 minutes: i agree
they promoted vanny so much but she wasn’t really included in the game
The game still seems like it was supposed to be an early access build. It's sad that this is the finished product they went with. These so called upcoming updates need to do a hell of a lot to fix this.
This is why robots will catch we.We will made our danger.
Jumpscare List:  3:33 Moon  7:28 Moon  10:45 Moon  12:23 Moon  27:52 Security Bot  28:26 Security Bot  29:13 Monty
When YouTubes notification system tells you this dropped an hour ago
Mark puzzling out the conditions for the true ending was super painful. All the lore entries were advice on how to proceed with the game and he didn’t even TOUCH the princess quest cabinets which are required for the true ending.  “Haunted arcade cabinets spooky, we put in places and tell u where.” “Ok lol that’s clearly just flavor” - actual cabinet for II being exactly where they said it was with a prompt to play - “I don’t know what to do with this”
Mark called Freddy. Freddy go past by him and wanted to talk to Monty instead
Gotta say the laziness in just animating as little as possible in the you are my superstar comic thing is unbecoming of the FNAF games. Don't make a fan game if you're gonna spit on the effort it should be given.
markiplier just experienced being left out by freddy.
Maybe Freddy was actually saving Monty than Gregory, maybe that's why he ran past Gregory
The intro cracked me up
the thing about this game now is that it expects quite a bit of attention to detail from the players. Tiny tidbits from the duffelbag messages actually give A LOT of info on how to “properly” play the game and discover secrets (like the playable arcade games).  Without watching the let’s-plays of other youtubers it would be so easy to miss out on crucial chunks of the game’s storyline.
You'd think a game as story-intensive as this would benefit more from an autosave system.
you will find me just like freddy you aslo WHERE IS LIX?
Freddy: you are my super star… Mark: **confused crying**
Dang, finally the freddy fazbear is come to an end, the incident starts with 5 missing children, and it is ended by a children, gregory is just an angel send by god to stop all of this madness
This game is so scuffed. The early-mid game is so fleshed out and paced pretty well, but then the last half is just a rushed amalgamation of random ideas. And what's with the "no saving"? Why is that a thing? Seriously, Devs... are you okay?
"It can't be the end"  Moondrop is coming for that kid. Bought to ruin Gregory's whole CAREER
The way Freddy kept running 😭😭
I lost it when Mark said  "Freddy dont wait for your turn" while Freddy casually walks behind Monty at the stairs 😆 the entire sequence with Mark screaming got me rolling 💀💀
When Freddy ran past Mark I swear I could hear taps playing
wtf is this game. It refuses to give context or instructions. It refuses to be stable or playable. The pacing is all over the place and the storylines seem to have no connection to one another (at least not after seeing this one playthrough, maybe that's on purpose though) and seem to start and conclude without any lead ups or hints beforehand.  I do not understand what this game is trying to be.  I like watching someone else play it and struggle with it, but I would never play it myself I think.
Freddy really screwed the pooch on this one
I didnt clicked at the links, come find me >:D
Singing. Dancing. Entertaining. Catering. Long ago, the four Fazbear elements lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the animatronics attacked. Only Freddy, the master of all four elements could stop them. But when Mark needed him most, he vanished. 28:44
mark: gets jumpscared.  also mark: What happened? What happened? What happened?
I think there is more to Vanny then we may know
This comment will get exactly 852 likes, no more or less
Yeah spam the call button then blame it on Freddy 🙄
It does look like this game needed more time in development. The ideas are solid, but the game itself is very wonky.
Im sorry but that at the end wasnt funny😐
A normal day at the office: "FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!"
Haha Freddy is Gregnant
Funfact: At the end credit scene there is a phrase called 'In memory of our friend Mike Hoffmann' He was the one who made the music, he sadly passed away in October at the age of 67. May he rest in peace
I wish to vanny
bro its so unfortunate that the endings were all comic strips
I'm fully convinced that this game wasn't play tested at all before release.
I have never laughed so hard at a Marikplier video. When Freddy ran past Mark when he was in his most desperate moment.
She didn't try to trick you She tricked you
WHATS WITH MARKS VIBES. i love this guy.  FREEEDEy!
I think Markiplier is turning insane.
Can someone confirm me that in 90s there were animatronics but not advanced like in fnaf
The screaming is funny sometimes, and other times I'm like shut the freaking hell up dude
I love how Freddy just ran past Mark as saying your on your fuckin own little shit 😂😂
If I remember this right, there was a Five Night At Freedy's VR and there was something involving Vanny's mask at the end, like an entity (named glitch trap ) controlling the mind of whoever goes too far in the game, and 'Vanny' was one of the player ( the main protagonist ) who felt in his control. If Vanessa is Vanny, it also makes sense: glitch trap control one of the director and can easily hire Vanessa, then has control from the outside and the inside.
f r e d d e e e e y! !
When Mark was calling for Freddy in a panic and Fred goes running past him on the stairs all confused was comedy gold 🤣
28:42 😂😂😂
Mark : ** Laughs at Freddy’s death**   Me: **Burst out Laughing at marks reaction**
FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
28:45 gaha
WHEN HE STARTED SCREECHING FREDDY'S NAME PLEASE- I'M DYING-
holy shit freddy running past mark was fucking amazing😂😂😂
Wait a minute, vanny is human right?
Mark you move away from where he is called to so it ain’t Freddy’s fault
Bro the staff bot at the end scared the shit out of me
I love Freddy so much.
in the first ending cutscene freddy does have monty's claws while makr didn't give them to him yet,,
28:43 comedy
Pastor Troy at the beginning of Throw It Up 4:23
In the game's defense, the reason Mark couldn't get Freddy to him in the ending is he doesn't seem to understand the summoning mechanic. Freddy doesn't come to you; he comes to where you hit the call button, so when Mark was frantically hitting the button, Freddy was going to the right spot. Mark was just already in a new spot by the time Freddy got there
What happened
Markiplier used: “I refuse!” *30mins left^  It was very effective!
This whole gameplay is just Mark screaming everywhere in the Pizzaplex lmao :D
If you want to see mark screem like a little girl. 28:37
When moon appeared and looked like he went for Freddy's stomach where Gregory was while saying "knock knock" is creepy.
17:58 Mark: laughing Me: holding back TEARS
Lixian, you should give ytp a shot!
Freddy running past Mark was just pure comedy gold. Never in my life have I laughed so hard watching a FnaF series.  This is why Mark is the king!
I knew he shouldn’t have listened to Vanessa. Sound like a trap/waste of time
Freddy running past mark and going to Monty is the funniest shit to me
FREDYYYYYY YOU BASTARD!!!!!!!
Mark, I love you, but you've got the memory of a goldfish. _You repeated the game yourself, out loud, that the recharging stations are no longer functional._
F and g 🥺❤️
Mark: this is where monty chased me Mark: *walks through door* Mark: *Game Over* Mark: WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED WHAT HAPPENED
Only listing classic FNAF-style jump scares here, not bot sound alerts:  3:33 — Daycare Attendant (Moon phase) 7:29 — Moon 10:45 — Moon 12:23 — Moon 27:53 — Security S.T.A.F.F. bot 28:27 — Security S.T.A.F.F. bot 29:14 — Montgomery Gator (Monty)
Kinda wish fnaf + Barney
24:40 Or it's because they rushed it to be released for Christmas (like many publishers force developers to do which results in a lesser version of the game).
You whant to Co e to germeny to find me?
Markiplier  in a literal  crisis Freddy: we still have time
Mark: "FREDDDDAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY FREDDDYYYYYYY" Freddy: "i maybe an animatronic, but i have manners. you first monty"
I CANT BREATHE DID THEY RUN OUT OF BUDGET
I don’t think that mark ever realized when he pings Freddy, he goes to wherever the spot is that you pinged him from. So the reason Freddy would run around so much is because he was continuously moving and pinging him over and over, having him not know where he really is
Lost my shit when Freddy ran past him
The Old King of Five Nights at Freddy's
FREDDY FREDDY !!!
Did it annoy anyone else off that his first choice wasn’t the “leave” option so we could get the false “correct” ending out of the way first and then move onto the further gameplay? Now I gotta google that ending because he STILL didn’t do it after the false “vanny” ending! Just kills me inside LOL
Monty coming Markiplier: Freddy FREDDY I NEED YOU NOW Freddy: Yeahhh Nah im good Markiplier: FREDDY FREDDDYYYYY WHYYYYYYY Monty: Hehe boi  Markiplier died  Markiplier: FREDDY U BASTARDDD!!!!!!!
"FREDDY YOU BITCH"  Screamed markiplier spamming q while being chased by a murderous mecha crocodile
i think he missed the memo where u can't use the recharge stations in the break for the exit stage.
Future me 16:58
... what the fuck is that option? what kind of awkward skip is just choosing that garbage out of the 3 and then proceeding to that cheesy ending comic strip nonsense? 14:15 literally 18:00 mark is having a stroke
Never wanna watch my new bear dad die again-
Most of the budget clearly went into beginning 2-3 hours of the game and then someone must’ve said “oh fuck it’s not enough” and the last 3 hours were rushed to shit most notably continuity, writing, direction and pacing. I thought the whole flashiness and subtle “look at how much money we have” type stuff like the intro animation was gonna be reflective of the setting but it turns out it may have just been poor time and fund management what a shame
((VIDEO SPOILERS))  Even if they couldn’t animate the last segment because it’d be “too gorey” (since Vanny is a supposed human) they still could’ve like…killed her some other way. Push her off a balcony or something. By not animating the last scene if feels so unfinished and makes it way less emotional.
The caution, map, and patrol bots were the villains
29:15 Freddy was doing exactly what you told him to do, that is, he was going to each and every spot you pinged, in order.  If you panic like that, it's only going to further screw you over.  Remember, freddy does not come to you, he goes to the location of the ping, so if you move away, he will not follow.  Use this to your advantage by not mashing the call button and wasting freddy's time and battery.  Also, if you mash and spawn in freddy early, it'll take that much longer for him to run to you.  wait and only press it once.  he'll spawn nearby, then move to the pinged location much faster then if you waste his time sending him wandering after repeated pings.
For the first time, I actually cried regarding Freddy. I couldn't stand that he had died.
Man this game feels so weird with so much jank. I really don’t like how it jumps to things happening with the cutscenes
I need the stair bit with Mark screaming at fready as he passes him and then fready politely waiting his turn walking down the stairs behind Monty animated. That was pure GOLD!
That was out of all nowhere
These comments are killing me 😂😂
2 Things: 1) Mark may be right with the whole 'things being excluded for development reasons' and such. Before this game was released, Scott Cawthon retired from making FNAF games all together and handed it off to another dev, which may have caused issues with certain things in this game. 2) Freddy absolutely screwing Mark over as he's getting chased by Monty is something else xD. Just something about Freddy sprinting past Mark as Mark yells his name at the top of his lungs.
after watching CoryxKenshin blow threw this game its jut annoying watching how much the so called king of fnaf is struggling. Im still gonna watch it.
12:40 you have to do it after the moonman segment ends.  I.E.  try to leave the building, then you can check the main stage.
I think Mark forgot that you can press Q to call freddy lol
Mark cracking up when Freddy says "You are my superstar" and me over here sobbing
I love Freddy calling him Superstar
I think we just killed a person in a Bunny suit!!
11:34  to 11:57 god mark ArE YoU SeRiOuS
You couldn't save before finalizing the upgrade?
Mark calling Vanny a Red-eyed Hare-ing was exceptional
The fact that Freddy doesn't stop running once he gets near you is actually crazy lol.
that vanny ending was the most disappointing thing ive ever seen
"FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!! FREDDY!!!!

17:48 here you go you sad fatherless children (aka for me so I can loop it)
10:52 ngl that spooked me a bit did nto expect moon man to teleport
Watch from 3:15 and close your eyes...
8:46
Click or you’ll come find us huh?  Sean has said the same and still nothing so I don’t believe you Mark
I think why the game wasn’t as cohesive is because the creator stepped down in like June and the game was finished off by a production team
at 27:21 on the right, it looks like there's a distraction. So the theatre must've been for something originally, I hope there's a type of dlc or something that lets you experience what was planned out to be in those areas.
Wait I’m so confused. Is Vanessa Vanny?? There’s two of th- What??
good news it is a cock
Marks the only guy who wouldn’t click leave at least once to see what it is.
STOP THE WAY FREDDY IGNORES HIM AND LET'S MONTY GO FIRST😭
0:00-0:07 Best. Intro. EVER! 5:10-5:42 LMFAO 7:29 JFC! 9:22-9:24 ..Are we about to learn that this is a SUPER prequel and Gregory is actually purple guy or something!? (His name DOES sound familiar now that I think about it!) 10:45 I SWEAR THESE JUMPSCARES ARE GONNA KILL ME SOMEDAY! 13:43 I just know Freddy's gonna turn on us so I don't want to feel TOO bad for him but omg, HE LOOKS SO SAD :( 14:08 OH SHIT! 14:30-14:32 I don't care when/how but PLEASE voice Freddy in the next upcoming movie/tv series/game/whatever of FNAF that comes out! You NAILED IT! 15:29 OH NO! 16:37 HE LIVES!! 16:47-16:49 YYYEEESSS!! 17:30-17:33 Oh come on, why can't we get what we got with Freddy!? :( 17:49-17:53 :( 17:58-18:00 Are you laughing or crying!? lol 18:39-18:46 My god, you're a genius! 19:46 The writers have such a way with words lol 20:34-20:35 YAY! SO GLAD WE'RE GETTING MORE <3 23:10 AGAIN >.< 23:18 TOO SOON!! 23:35-23:39 I'm just shaking my head at this point.. 26:34 Anyone else start singing that or just me? 27:53 Ya done jinxed yourself! 28:39-28:49 OMG I'M IN TEARS! LMFAO 30:16-30:20 Dark? Is that you?
After watching that ending I’m pretty sure that everytime you call Freddy to your location he goes to where that signal was sent not where you currently are 😂😂
The moon guy is the only npc that can attack you while in Freddy and it's mainly rng based
Yes, my liege. This 7:14 is the slow way. Hahaha
7:44 this happens every video
does FNAF hate bunnies or something??? cause this weird character in here is a bunny and it was the same thing in VR too, right???
Around 10:50 when moon caught him I jumped so hard 😂
*mark spamming freddies button* *freddy also being terrified of monty after hearing him trashing his room sprints away leaving mark for dead*
Freddy said "nah fam I'm good you got this 🚶‍♂️"
What an absolute fucking 180 with that comic strip ending. They spent all the budget on the fucking intro 😭 I’ve been waiting for a lot of this game’s weird decisions to become part of the *intricate story but it probably won’t. Maybe there will be some clarity provided in the stay option, but I don’t know. Things will have to start falling into place pretty quickly
28:43 LET ME IN- FREEEDDDDYYYYY!!! FREDDY YOU BITCH!!
mark trying to get in a recharging station after he was specifically told they dont work is absolutely hilarious
stop pressing Q thats why freddy cant find a path
I heard benny hill when mark was running from Monty and calling freddy
28:39 why was freddy just running away 😭
I wonder if Mark knows that there's supposed to be six endings
its actually really refreshing to see some1 call out that this game is broken. i mean yes it has good parts in it, but for the most part i 100% agree with what mark said about how it seems like 2 different teams worked on it and something went wrong during development. and the bugs and glitches are copious. its almost as if the game itself is just a glitchy E3 demo ment to show what the real game might look like. except this is suppose to be the actual game XD and its very weird that its 90 gigs, but such a short game ( so short they have to split up different endings to make up for the lack of content) and i also agree that it seems like they spent the money from the budget to fast on something, because the comic book endings are hilariously cheap.
freddy's just like "it sucks that my friend is blind now but these eyes are awesome so it's okay"
is it just me or some parts of the game are missing from his clips?
When your friend betrayed you at your most dire moment
I was so interested in this game for the first little while, but it is SCUFF towards the end lmao. Like I have watched every episode but this one almost entirely feels like I skipped 2 or 3 😂
freddy running in every direction besides mark's is too funny LMAOOOO
I didnt click the link. *activates tag mode*
If you purposefully blur your eyes, the twinkles look really cool. 4:50
28:40 The biggest act of betrayal that I’ve ever seen- also the biggest act of betrayal that made me laugh that hard! 😂
this game is so bad lmao glad i didnt buy it
The betrayal im shitting
Mark: FREDDYYYY!! FREDDAAAAAAYYYY!!! Freddy: Must’ve been the wind
what it is is what happens when you don’t have a singular project lead thats why with the other games everything fit together like a perfect puzzle because it was all scott looking over it now that he’s gone it’s a jumbled mess
Freddy does not run to your CURRENT position, he runs to the position when you press his call button.... good to know
I love how everyones reaction is the endings seem like they ran out of budget XD
28:43 Mark hitting opera levels there
i think they patched freddy so he goes to where you first summon him, aka not very handy in times of need😅 they better put their budget to good use because this game would be nice if they used their original plan, maybe future updates??
I love watching him rage
11:38 don’t worry mark im am soooo  zerious
Did anyone else start wheezing when moon just popped out of no where did a lil dancey dance waiting to kill us 😂
25:32  I made a mistake of sneezing  I’m sorry
Game: Recharge stations not active.  Mark: Are you serious? x50
THE STAFF BOT COMEDY 💀
The way he screamed Freddy the whole time 😂  28:40 i diiiiied
Mark: freddyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!  Freddy: SIKE!!!!!!
28:38 can’t stop laughing at this
"good news! It is almost a COCK!"
Mark: Are you serious x20 (yes i counted)
28:40 Freddy: peace out fam Mark:FREDDY YOU B****  ME: XD *x.x* I'm dying of luaghter
I kinda wish that we could _break the daycare attendant, too_
Ok but Freddy dying made me really fucking upset :(
I mean, props to Gregory for staying up until 6 AM. Moon has a point, that is awful late for anyone
my dog's name is freddie (diff spelling, I know) and towards the end, i felt lowkey attacked
The game: *get to a recharge station*  Mark: I do not see
Everyone: Not being able to find gregory Mark absolutely destroying the sound barier: *FRRRRRRREEEEEEEDDDDDDAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY!*
Mark: * *panicked screaming while spamming Q* *    Freddy: Must've been the wind.
28:45 LMFAO
mark: FREDDYYYYYY FREDDY MONTY IS CHASING MEEEEEEEE freddy: y'all hear sumn?
Mark: or something went wrong with the development One of the SB creators on Twitter: yeaaah I definitely didn't accidentally deleted almost every SB file.... Hehe
ok so how can moon-head catch gregory inside freddy's belly? CAN MOONDROP TEAR FREDDY APART??!
3:30 The Jumpscare....  WITH NO JUMPSCARE ANIMATION 🤯
Freddy no🥺😭 LITERALLY SOBBING
.....is this a speed running game now? He can't save after getting to six am and if the gift boxes/collectibles aren't permanently collected then you'd have to gather all the items you missed before six plus another animatronics special feature without being able to save over and over   Pls tell me I'm wrong this sounds awfullllllll for a huge map like this
… I was just eating some ice cream and then a jump scare came at  27:53.. I ended up throwing it everywhere from being so surprised 😭😭
10:56
It's very impressive that mark can still entertain us considering how awful this game is
"FREDDY YOU BASTARD!" This game has more bugs than an anthill.
I refuse to click the links. Do it. Find me. Pwepare for dah thmackdown!!!
28:40 he could have kept running but he waited for Monty
26:00 dont mind me, just saving my spot
Imagine this place existed irl
Guys help im simping for Vanny
Such a terrible game lol. Love watching mark play through this shit fest
do aneone eals see freddy as a dad now of just me
GOOD NEWS! IT IS ALMOST A COCK!
I wanted to see what happens when you go back to the main stage after being invited there by Vanessa. I'm sad to see that it's nothing (or maybe there's something to unlock first) but at least now I know.
My favorite running gag is all the wet floor sign bots making ominous noises every time Mark looks at them
I can't wait to see someone make an animation of mark being chased by Monty asking for friends and then when he shows up Freddy drives past him in a car or something someone make it happen mark make it happen lol
Every full hours Moon will kill you
I don't like that you assumed that wasn't the real ending not because of how it ended but because it was a comic and you assume that the true ending is going to be 3-D animated.
who the f*ck edited the intro???  it too fun ny
⚠️ SPOILER!!!! ⚠️   I only just noticed that Gregory says “we can hide you somewhere” rather than ‘we can hide you at my house’. (Hint that he’s homeless)  Also, Glam Freddy looks like he’s ready to fight the staff bots before Vanny shows up- perhaps he saw movement from where she was and was thrown off by her bunny-like appearance because of whatever happened to Bonnie (from Bonnie bowl).
game: "go to the exit the night is over, the charging stations don't work anymore, moon gets you if 6am comes, leave" mark: "gonna pretend i didn't hear that"
30:13 "I’ll come find you" Yeah, right. Freddy there said the same thing.
Freddy walking down the steps slowly behind Monty had me wheezing 🤣 💀
The 28 minute mark is just a thing of beauty. Thank you for the laughs!
Mark :Freddy I'm about to die by Monty  Freddy: oh Gregory I see you  are calm with Monty bye  Mark: you piece of shit Freddy
"what happened x1500" "what happened was moonman got me." yeah obviously mark-
Through the power of editing, we'll never know how many times Mark redid Freddy's Eyes and the expertise of skills he obtained of reinserting them....  But the editor guy, he'll always know.
28:43 this scene alone of Markiplier screaming and shouting at a not so helpful Freddy makes this my favorite video of the year, geezums I cried XDD
Why VANNY why???
Notice how Freddy apart from being a comediant is pollite paciently walking after Monty to get down the stairs
*Tune in to **28:36** for optimal experience*  Freddy ponders to himself upon hearing these strange, sudden, and rather manly ear shattering cries for help. “Hm… perhaps someone listened to that one ‘It’s Friday’ song for the first time. Ah. Poor them… oh well! Back to business! …where did Gregory go?”   Mark/Gregory stands there, frantically screaming his name as Freddy zooms straight past him. “Get me in! Get me in- Freddy?! FREDDY YOU BITCH! FREDDYYYYY!!! FREeEDdDdDyYyYYY!!!!!”
The cut between Gregory at the door and Freddy getting disassembled is so weird LOOOOL
20:43
Vanessa : go check the main stage mark: what u mean by that
Mark, yea we like your suffering but that's not because we dont love you, its just because seeing you frustrated makes "us" (atleast me) smile. but I generally just love watching your videos and thank you for being you in your videos makes your channel a million times better then if you tried being someone else 😀😅 Hope you had a great Christmas!
You keep spamming the call freddy button so your making the his AI freak out, also I feel for your neighbors.
mark im not clicking the links o.o
Mark: Freddeeeeeyyy Freddy: Coming :3 oh hey monty have you seen greg?
LOL!!!!! 28:42 Mr. Bear ran pass him, to go to the spot where Mark first started pressing the help button. I noticed this happened to Mark earlier too lol and it's the funniest crap ever.
Freddy: *fucking dies* Mark: *starts having a stroke*
"a red HARE-RING like a red herring with red eyes" mark is doing mat pats job fine
Why is no one talking about the "GOOD NEWS! IT IS ALMOST A COCK"  shit had me dead 🤣
wait did anyone else just figure this out or am i just stupid-  monty -> bonnie roxy ->foxy  and then there’s chica and freddy ofc   it’s not like- major but i thought it was cool 😩
Freddy dying was the only thing that can make a true man cry
when Vanessa said “go to the main stage” and that Gregory would be a good security guard…. well what if he’s connected somehow to the security guard in the previous FNAF ? is this too much of a stretch?
Poor Mark taking so long to realize there's multiple endings to the game that all depend on how quickly you play through it
28:43 mark: FREDDYYYYYYY FREDDY YOU BITCH
This game feels rushed to be honest. Not saying the game is super duper bad tho, but the feeling that it could be so much better if they used some more time to polish the game and the plot is not leaving me.
Every time mark dies he has to restart like 10 minutes lol
This game is so terrible ahah. Mark is doing great at focusing on the positives!
Mark; when Freddy got disassembled, it showed he had all the upgrades, the last one was monty’s claws
Can't wait for the animated video. Freddy moments were golden, huh! ;)
you. are. my. superstar.  dont mind me, im just fucking sobbing and banging my head on the wall.
never cried so hard when freddy said 'you are my superstar..'
Watching Mark try to do things that the game said is no longer possible is so frustrating. "I'mma go to a charging station" Like.... did you hear a word Freddy just said?😂
Mark: Freddy I need you  Freddy: 👩‍🦯
I actually thought that comic book style cutscene was a cool idea, it was just super out of place.
Freddy's death just kinda feels meaningless to me, like it just doesn't leave an impression at all. I feel like there weren't enough moments where they built freddy's relationship with the player to warrant you caring about his death.
"...You are my  superstar..." that shi made me tear up. 😭
I'd love a DLC where you could play through the game with one of the other 3 stars
27:51
Amazing
The Vanny ending threw me off. I was super into the story with Freddy and Gregory but I couldn’t feel sad because the sudden comic style threw me off so badly. Maybe if there was previous comic strips instead of full-on animations, it would’ve had more impact but idk man
Mark saying ""FRADDY U BITCH"" when he pass him made me lose it.
Here's your replay button for the funniest moment of the year: 28:38
Dude what is this garbage. Not Mark, this has been entertaining as hell, but this game. Why are people giving this dude $40?  Bugs, glitches, missing endings and animations. Holy Hell.
bunny
Mark:FREDDY I NEED YOU!!! Freddy running in another direction Away from him When mark needs him• Mark:FREDDY YOU BITCH!!!
WHY AM I CRYING
Why did that intro make me bust out laughing
Can moon see mark even if he is in fready
28:40 I just died at this part 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH
what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened what happened
I genuinely cannot think of a single good reason to disable saves after 6am. What point does that serve? It's a jump-scare horror game, it doesn't need more tension. Maybe if the game worked exactly as intended, it would seem more like a challenge and not just artificial difficulty. But having to replay long sections of the game over and over again is just going to make players frustrated. It's honestly baffling to me.
فاني فاني ا
OHY FUCK8NG GOD "you are my superstar" BEING FREDDYS LAST SORDS BEFORE HE DIES OH MY FUCKING GOD I AM UNWELL AND I AM SOBBING
28:43-28:50 😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲
Freddy waiting his turn on the stairs was hilarious, such a polite gentleman
did the budget just drop suddenly? so they switched to comic format?
28:42  *Mark frantically high pitch screaming* "FREEEEEEEEEEEEDDY" *Freddy acknowledging Marks's presence* "Deuces!"
Lmao I love this: FREDDY!?!? FREDDYYYY Freddy: *runs past him* FREDDY YOU BITCH
i understand mark ur saying vanny is a killa bunny :D
IM CRYING WHY DID FREDDY DIE- THE HAIR TAP THO-  😭

mark never reading a single message that pops up is pretty great. The game straight up told him the recharge stations were shut down and he even read it out loud lol
Plot twist. The caution signs are the masterminds behind it all.
29:14 pov ur name is freddy and u didn’t clean ur room
If you stand on a bench then the animatronics dont try to kill you.
Imagine Gregory screaming like Markiplier, that would be totally hilarious.
this game is so shit??? thats all. thas literally all ive got to say.
When Freddy ran at the wall I thought he was gon Kool Ade man through🤣
oh mark the things you’ll see…
"did they run out of budget for the last animation?" PLEASEBSABISNSCK
There's 6 different endings to this game
You are right about the game playing entirely different. In the audio files for the game there are entire folders for a friendly Vanessa, AND a PLAYABLE Vanessa. Then they changed it to where Vanessa is evil. There is also alot more cut content, but they said they are going to release updates and dlc through 22, so maybe stuff will come back.
I don't even care about the game anymore. The last 2 mins of this video made it all worth it for me.
Honestly this game would of been really great if it was alien isolition but fnaf.
YES CARL MADE IT INTO SECURITY BREACH (If you dont know who im talking about carl is original chicas cupcake)
Man, this game got scary around 30:12
Mark: Let's go back up to the main stage. "Goes down"
17:57 same
There are so many moments where the game just _assumes_ you've done certain objectives even if you haven't  In the final cutscene/comic, freddy has Monty's claws even if you don't collect them  Gregory also mentions the disappearances even though they're only really mentioned from finding collectables It would've worked better if Freddy said something along the lines of "is that why you came here?" And Gregory would either say "yeah, and I found a lot of evidence here too!" Or "I.. had a hunch" if you haven't found many messages Of course, that would be a bit demanding from this game, but still
3:33 Moon 7:28 Moon  10:45 Moon 12:23 Moon 27:52 Security Bot 28:26 Security Bot 29:13 Monty
"FREDDY!"  Freddy runs past Mark " *FREDDY YOU BITCH!* "
Why do you try the recharge station when the game says they don't work anymore?
markeplier:*needs freddys help* freddy:*runs past markeplier*
25:41 that’s definitely an easter egg referring to fnaf 2 😳
28:43  Mark: FREDDYYYY Freddy: "You're on your own, superstar🏃‍♂️"
As a warning to everyone, Scott was almost raped by his stalkers and his family was threatened to be slaughtered in front of him all because a Vivziepop fan had stalked him and she found out a single decision he made which he never vocalized in the slightest. So that is why he had almost no involvement in the game development, he retired about 4 months before the game released to protect his family including his then unborn second child.
Somehow this game is simultaneously really good and really bad. So many good horror moments... And then you get the Vanny ending and suddenly change your mind
sometimes buggy game are fuking comedy. freddy literally just abandoned mark 2× in a row
seems lovely how Freddy doesn't run to you just past you. Gregory must be the ghost of a child
"You're my superstar."   **sobs uncontrollably**
Fred you had one job. Ø Ñ Ē
Game: Recharging stations are now disabled Mark: Let's go a recharging station! That will help us!
*mark needing Freddy at the most dire time* *Freddy running past him caring about himself*
mark should do a reaction of all of his old fnaf videos
All of the places you haven't went yet is because you went to fazerblast instead of monty golf.
"FREDDYYYYYY!!!!" Freddy: oh it's the wind again
I think mark forgot the charging stations are offline even tho we know he saw that notification THREE TIMES
I Laughed too hard when Freddy passed mark XD
does anyone else find it super insulting and offensive for mark to assume the devs "ran out of budget" because they decided the endings to have a comic book graphical approach, and not it just being an artistic choice for the game...like wtf mark, so rude. just because there are comic still graphics doesnt always mean a dev "ran out of budget" and have to resort to stupid drawings as the ending cut scene....totally rude and insulting to the devs and the art team.
It's currently 6:02 and moon man hasn't got me yet O.o
what
Anyone else see two stars, as it ended the first time, couldve meant that theres a true ending to come
The best parts are when Mark screams "FREDDY! FREDDYYYYYY!!!" That made me so hard laugh
Lol darkiplier is back
3:16 best one 5:25 9:10 28:47 🤣
28:40 Thank me later
Freddy was running past mark like   Sup gregory
That last part was peak comedy
The slow subtle change on Mark's face as freddy get's disassembled was perfect. From curiosity to wait....did that happen.
This story feels so incoherent...
28:45 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I bet you Markiplier's neighbors hate whoever Freddy is
Wait, disappearances? I thought I had been paying attention pretty well to multiple playthroughs and I don't remember anything about disappearances. Can someone explain?
"Freddy? FREDDY" Says Mark, while screaming and pointing a flashlight directly at Monty.
mark turned into matt
5:41 Ugh this was painful to watch. Not understanding basic mechanics and button mashing to try to get something to work is the opposite of big brain time.
9:47 looks like its mark singing
28:00 best part of the video
Throughout this whole series it always bothered me that Mark never figured out that Freddy goes to the spot where you last pressed the button. So him pressing it while running always had him running away from Freddy then he got mad at Freddy. The Monty stair chase shows that perfectly and is absolutely hilarious but I still feel bad for Freddy getting yelled at by Mark for his own stupidity
Mark yet has not collected the fax camera yet he is losing his mind over everything else :think mark think:
7:24
Mark, dont make apologys for a game that was not playtested in the slightest
Omg i love the way Mark is screaming for Freddy 😂
this game completely sucks lmfao
Mark could not have articulated my impression of the game any better in the second half. The questions about game development and the overall mixed feelings about the game- strange disjointed areas completely at odds with engaging sequences. I'd love to hear a "behind the making of" kind of interview about the game's creation and the challenges that came with it.
*markiplier saying what might be other endings* -that sad music playing in backround-
they should make a five nights at marks 🤣
I need a video of marks pain and suffering throughout this series now please
"They run out of the budget for the ending"  Is the best comments I heard about Fnaf so far lol 🤣
If you are gonna come find me I’m leaving the country and getting a whole new identity-
3:51 the subtitles 😭 “let’s begin by removing daddy’s face 😁”
No, Mark, it was not a budget thing. they chose the comic style to indicate that was not a true ending.
watching this playthough has given me so many new drawing ideas, and now I'm going to draw Greg running from monty with freddy going "bye felicia" right past him
Yea, Mark will come find you like Freddy finds Gregory when called upon.😂
Why does moon somehow get you while you’re inside Freddy? Game is so jank
it all happened so fast bruh 😭
I LITERALLY BURST OUT CRYING WHEN FREDDY SAID "you are my superstar..." I STILL AM
Freddy has bad hearing.
Are you going to continue inscription or something?
7:29  Hell yeah  Door jumpscare
Mark: FREDDYYYY !!! Freddy: Gotta go fast!!
the url has "bruh" in it
Monty chasing mark:  Mark: FREDDAYYYYY📈📈📈📈📈 Freddy: 👨‍🦯👨‍🦯👨‍🦯👨‍🦯
wtf was that concept art ending
the way Freddy run past mark 😂😭
"Freddy, You Bastard !"
freddy: you… are my… superstar….     mark: *dry confused wheezing*
nobody gonna adress the mini jumpscares mark makes with the little cleaning bots?
E
Fnaf: **shows a very depressing scene**  Me: **violently sobs**  Mark: BAHAHSUQBDHAIDV- WHAT- I DONT UNDERSTAND???
Seeming that Freddy actually started screwing Mark over by passing through him was the most hilarious thing I've in this series
amazing as always. Markiplier is truly remarkable,  his videos and content brings a tear to my eye. Im amazed by how this man can play so many horror games and end up unscarred.
Mark doing his editor notes reminds me of new Vegas slides and I kinda want him to play fallout now
mark my dream is to meet you so yes please come find me
Spoilers !!!         So if you pick vanny and go up to her chamber and play the arcade machine you get to save vanny frome the bad guy, you mus play the other 2 arcade machines princess 1 and 2. The third is in her room there with the buton. If you play princess 3 you get a nice ending and you dont kill vanny and vanny is vanessas twin sister witch is controled buy a bot 😎
Glitchy Freddy is the best of this game
Good news!, it is almost a Cock!
There are more fnaf endings but you have to play more to unlock cutscenes and endings
FRRREEEEDYYYYY!!!!
In other playtroughs you have missions on these places you didn't go trough
I love Mark but God does he not listen to directions lmao especially with how he was saying the "story doesn't fit together as well" like bro if you'd just follow the direction it'd make so much more sense lol
When Vanny says there's a surprise on the stage, there was a button to press.
The map doesn't exist
you should play the princess quest arcade games
i love freddy , he called gregory his superstar that was soo sadd 😭
Find me Mark
soooo...i did not have to do Macersize.....Oh how I hate knowing this....i chose the lesser of the paths
The ending to this video has me dying with laughter
There are six endings in Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach  FNAF: Security Breach Ending - Orphan Gregory (worst ending)  FNAF: Security Breach Ending - Freddy And Gregory Escape In The Van  FNAF: Security Breach Ending - Using The Emergency Exit  FNAF: Security Breach Ending - Beating The Princess Quest Mini-Games  FNAF: Security Breach Ending - Disassembling Vanny  FNAF: Security Breach Ending - Stopping Glitchtrap (Canon Ending)
Game: sad moment that freddy died.  Mark: "laughs and cracks a joke about the budget". ME: B R U H.
When he goes like sirieus sirieus my Siri turnt on
Is it just me or does security breach just lack a crucial chunk of the game. It either seems theres a giant chunk of the game missing or they just didn't have the budget. Nothing feels the way it should. It feels like sections are cut extremely short, or lack a plot point. It's like most of the lore is just gone or unfinished. Cutscenes throw you into the middle of things without context and answers, they dont last long enough and are generally unpolished. Take the beginning for example, it's a little introduction to the characters, then it throws you in without answers, your just in freddy. That's heavily unpolished and confusing. I think alot of the story was cut in favor of the gameplay, but fnaf's main appeal has always been the mystery and story, which security breach lacks both of.
FREDDY NOOOOOOOOOOo :(
This game feels incredibly rushed. Between the bugs, this ending, how plot points develop, it feels like it should've been delayed another year.
These bots are 😃
MARKPLIER CONTENT IS BETTER!!! MINE IS GARBAGE 😂🖕🏽🖕🏽🖕🏽
Only fnaf could make me want a marketable plushie of a wet floor sign. Also I agree with mark on the game status, hopefully there will be a patch or hopefully side stories that will utilize these environments. Maybe these side stories could feature a respective kid for Monty, Roxy, and Chica. Of course they’d have to be shorter than the main game and only have one ending, but it would still be cool to see some new sides to the other bots and see these other areas get utilized
really glad mark is giving SOME criticism for the game because MAN THIS GAME WASN’T READY FOR RELEASE. yes, it had SO SO much potential and overall, great story. but the bugs and the endings with the comics… man 😭😭
I think what happend with freddy running past you was that he was going to every place you called him
"FREDDY DONT WAIT YOUR TURN GODDAMMIT!"
28:38 for anyone who wishes to experience peak comedy
Damn, the comment section is filled with the same jokes...
Bro enough!! I can hear u
U know it's Freddy when he brings a whole earthquake with him
28:42 Freddy fr went: "Que Pro"
plan A?? MAYBE? there a ending if you stay on the main stage for long enough? going play more to find out
Love mark forgetting about the scream from chika
This is a great game but I think Mark was spot on when he said Scott ran out of budget. You can tell he wanted to make this game even bigger with more missions and the ability to utilize and interact with more rooms and items. This is one of those games i hope scott continues to work on and people revisit down the line cause i still don't think this game has reached its full potential.
Was that the bite of 87!!!  ( old markplier Fnaf 4 reference)
Where did Chica's voice box disappear to?
When Freddy steam rolled past mark all I could hear in my head was FLINT LOCKWOOOOOD.
28:31 is where the meltdown begins
True ending includes you playing that arcade game i think
7th hour, 7th day, part 7 and its 7 am for me rn.
This game really made me cry over an animatronic that literally could kill us...... thanks Scott
"I will find you"  Bet.
My new favourite quote: “Freddy! Freddy! Freddy don’t wait your turn!”
When mark was yelling FREDDDAYY while Monty was chasing him and he just ran straight past him that was hilarious 🤣
Please, someone has to animate the part where Freddy runs past mark 😂😂
That was top 10 anime betrayals worthy
Mark, if you keep spamming Freddy's call button like that, that will happen. It comes to where you pressed the button. So you need to press it when you know you won't be moving. Stop spamming his button...
there's multiple endings Mark  , including one with a character that always comes back ;)  hope you find them all maybe  !
Pls don't call our freddy bastard
17:23 r34 artists: allow me to introduce myself.
That dream overlay is kind of annoying
Ok but Freddy saying "You are my superstar" broke me- istg-
your suffering is content
29:17 FREDDY YOU BASTAAAAARD!?!?!
Jesus christ can you stop saying "what" and just get it on with it?
Leave, stay, Vanny lol
So why does a pizza place, a place for children, have a daycare for you to... drop your children off at? It's like if you went to chuck e cheese, but left your kids at home with a babysitter.
28:43 this is the art of betrayal 😂😂 i laughed so hard when freddy walk past by him when he needed him the most 😂😂
Clearly you need to play a downpatch version
Imo, this is by far the worst FNAF game
28:42 I CHOOOKKEEDDD
27:39 Freddy pog
28:36 IM LITERALLY COKINGBYHV
Disassemble Vanny.  This kid, just told ALL of the robots in the pizzarea, to rip a female human being to shreds with their bare hands.
Mark: Recharge station? Somewhere  else besides front door? Why isnt this working  Instruction card: Am I a joke to you?
i love how the vanny's ending was supposed to be emotional but how they made it and how mark was confused just made it hilarious the fact everyone thinks the game spent all their budge is funny too and tbh same  i truly feel this game has a lot of potential right there but they just made it so quickly that there's not really feelings behind other than the fandom puts to them as always, they shouldn't have pushed the game into finishing so quickly like, mf we can wait for a better version, what the hell were those endings and dialogues
26:35 Is that movie screen a Stupendium reference? His Fallout 76 song has an almost identical line at the end
lol after doing this much at the last at vanny they ran out of butget LoL                     Can i ask u what are u doing here???
17:51 I Swear Im Cutting Onions at 2 In The Morning
It’s so hard to watch this series, I’ve never seen Mark so bad at a game
Wtf was with that Vanny ending- FNAF with like so much fewer animations and cutscenes did SO MUCH better at storytelling than this shipwreck lol
RAN RIGHT PAST HIM IM SHITTING BRICKS HELP
25:00 I do believe you in that aspect. Steel Wool perhaps changed a lot during development and ended up rushing the game to get it out on December of this year. They mentioned that they’re considering content updates, but first they’ll fix all major performance/bug issues and tale a break.  Awesome video. 28:43 I freaking love this.
I don't think y'all understand how monumental the ending was,,,, Vanny, is the girl from FNAF help wanted, the one that purple guy possessed. By killing Vanny it brings a final end to to rein of terror that was purple guy.
Lord help me I’m getting angry with Mark for not paying attention when they said the recharging stations won’t work
Mark. Bro. Dude. They said SO MANY TIMES last episode that the recharge stations are off before 6
7:42 Lixian, Mark needs a reboot soon. Please find a way…
mark, i know this is late, but you are constantly pinging a location for him to go to. not to mention it seems like it's more of a start stop based button press. it's not a "come to me" button. It's more like a "come to this spot" button.
dear god the vanny end; freddy my  h e a r t
"I'll show you the clip because I know you enjoy me suffering" your the masochist MARK!!!!!!
13:33 bro stop I almost started crying
"If you do not click them[ the links below] i will find you" Mark, don't threaten me with a good time
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation?" IT HAD ME DYING LMAOOOO
Freddy just completely running past Mark, and Mark just completely losing his shit😂😂
this was an emotional rolercaoster
tbh, if you can make a game Markiplier proof, then you've successfully tested the game.
I loved when he yelled Freddy omg that's how you know they really are friends
Mark: Screaming for Freddy   Freddy: *Where art thou my child*
Vanny ending is unbelievably disappointing
bruh that comic ending was horrible
Are you afraid of death?   Read this carefully for the cure ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
14:21 hi future self
Not fully trying to justify it, but the Vanny ending isn’t supposed to be satisfying, or even ‘good’. Despite the fact that it’s logically the best ending for a supposed serial killer in a horror game franchise, we know by now that FNAF doesn’t work that way. The best ending for a FNAF fan doesn’t usually involve a villain getting their just desserts. So, how do you represent that specific feeling inside of a horror game like this? You give out a rushed, cheap, and unsatisfactory ending comic book style while also making sense from a logical point of view.  That is, it *would* be more justifiable if the *rest* of the game wasn’t rushed and somewhat unsatisfying too.
Lol
i havent finished this series so im gonna come up with a theory: vanny is vanessa. that is it. thats my theory
Freddy dies  me:FREEEEEEEEEEDDDY
Nobody: Mark: Casually explains why areas were "unused" knowing full well he hasn't completed everything in the game
Anything happens:   Mark: WHAT FRESH HELL IS THIS
30:20 ok? im still waiting-
I'm sorry, but I painfully do enjoy watching your suffering....     [BURP]
the vanny ending made me laugh really hard it was so abrupt
Freddy isn't broken, Mark just doesn't have the patience to learn the mechanics. He comes to the last ping, not directly to you so if you incessantly hit the button and keep running, he will bypass you every time.
FREDDAYYYEEEE
FREEDY! YOU BASTARD!!!!!!!! 😂🤣😂🤣😂😭😭😭
😟
Please play inscryption😩😩😩😩😩😩
I wish he had done the Vanny secret ending tho w/ Princess Quest in Vanny's hideout
Oh no.. stop just a disassembling vanny  😏
Hey Mark When Vanny Ending There Is Princess quest 3 u must complete 1 and 2 to get the main ending
Thank you, Mark! I'm sorry the comments are lacking on this one but I still enjoyed all that you did here.
28:40 hhahahahhahahaha
Moon when about to attack Gregory who is inside Freddy- Let me in! *LET ME IN!!!*
Man, the Freddy summoning tool is...badly implimented, huh?
Even if you never read this, Mark, you talking about places under-utilized -- there was the choice between lazertag and mini-golf.  You just haven't seen parts of the game because of other paths you took.
people named vanessa: 🥲
I’m so glad Mark acknowledges the fact this game is essentially unfinished. It was personally very frustrating to me that you can clearly see some stuff was cut off for the sake of getting the game out as quick as possible, given the past delays. The comic style cut scene endings really threw me off when I saw them and it was so disappointing since Scott has been able to do much effective endings in the past with less. The lag, bugs and other broken game dynamics really didn’t bother me at all because I was just so mad with the rest of it, though I still think if the game had been properly finished it wouldn’t have bothered me either because look at how ambitious the soul of this game is.   I understand why this happened, but it’s still so very sad and disappointing that this is what we got after such a long wait. The thing that was bothering me the most is I personally hadn’t seen any discourse on the matter since so many fans are stuck with the fan service and the cool new characters, which is fine but it is refreshing to see one of my favorite YouTubers acknowledge it and also so many people on this comment section doing so as well.
Mark: "FREDDY!!!!" Spamming the Q button frantically.  Freddy: "GREGORY WHERE  ARE YOU!!? " Running around confused having no idea which location to stay on due to frantic Q pressing.
He sounded like Chewbacca saying "nooo wayyyy" at the credits
this episode was just so painful to watch
28:00 😂😂😂
Mark was probably on of Chris's nightmares
Freddy running up the stairs and away from you has me absolutely dead😂
bro when that security bot got mark in the theater i jumped out of my skin 😭
Angry Mark.
Can we all just agree that Freddy is now Gregory’s dad? He’s like the FNAF version of Toriel, I swear. He even has a sweet lil nickname for the kid like my dad has for me. Freddy calling Gregory ‘Superstar,’ reminds me time and time again of how my dad always calls me either, ‘Peanut/Peanut Butter,’ or, ‘Little.’
The game is really pretty but it reminds me of how I made houses in Sims as a kid, way too big and spacious for what’s actually necessary
That Vanny “ending” was actually hilariously bad
Vanessa being evil < Vanessa actually being good
Mark screaming for Freddy: Freddy: y'all hear somn
"You are my superstar" **SLAMS FISTS INTO DESK AND SCREAM SOBS**
He's like ffffrreeeeeeeeedddddddddyyyyyyyy
17:57 Mark: - Sad depleted dying breath -
At 28:40 I laugh so hard that i cry, FRREEEYYYDDDDYYYYYYYYYYY
Accept Jesus as Lord today
mark not understanding how freddy works is so funny but so... SO fucking frustrating
LMAOOOO 28:41
it concerns me on how many massive fucking blast doors there are in the pizzaplex
Now maybe... MAYBE... The reason that it's half and half in content, is because Scott worked on the game, until he was forced out because of some butthurt people online harassed him out of his own series because he had different political standings that them, something that they sought out THEMSELVES.
I laughed as hard as I have ever laughed when freddy just passes him on the stairs.
Mark: “FREDDAYYYYY- here get me in here!!” Freddy: “hold up gotta go take a quick one.“
The absolute panic attack when Monty was chasing you 😭
Watching Freddy run past you up the stairs while you're screaming was one of the FUNNIEST things I've seen!
23:34
i think the reason they didnt put the last cut scene in is because a human geting ripped apart would be to grapic
I love mark but for some reason this game gave him so much trouble 😭 hed forget or miss 1 crucial point of information and run around in confusion and frustration like mark noooooo
Freddy being polite and waiting his turn when Mark needs him most 😭😭😭
28:42 the utter betrayal 😭
Not the captions saying “let’s start by removing Daddy’s face” at 3:53
So has anybody noticed in the cutscene ending sammy had stitching all over her as if it was a full body animatronic look alike suit
Mark theres been a glitch in the matrix with everything going wrong around you this episode.
Mark I know what you mean with game feeling unfinished and having parts missing. I think part of what happened was Scott stepping down halfway through development. Honestly at first I wasn't sure about this new era of FNAF but its really grown on me, I just wish there was more effort put into certain aspects, because this game could have been way more epic than it already is.
I actually love Mark doing the narrations when he pauses the game to explain how he fucked up lmao
28:41, I LOST IT AT THIS PART!!!
Bro.when mark come out of the elevator ... I was like "AH WHERE DID YOU COME FROM FREDDY"
28:40 i cant stop laughing
i really wish they didnt have every action part be a cut scene- it feels like a cop out and w a y too fast for a more emotional / boss battle type sequence :")))
Mark said “so clear now” and I was instantly teleported back to his “Air Control” video.
Are we not gonna talk Abt how the time went from 5:53-5:51?
Honestly kinda sad to see that not even FNAF can escape the recent trend of releasing a broken game
I am constantly switching between "Damn... This is pretty good." and "Scott should have stuck with the flash game type format" with this game and it's bugs
I cry at that ending every time, the "You are my Superstar" hurts my heart.
I just realized every little tote bag message you collect is a mini quest within that area. You probably need to do all of them to get the game to completion and each little fact donates some of the plot and fleshes out what's going on.
what the fuck is going on????
Haha mark doesn't know how freddy is called.
Mark: "FREDDY, FREDDY A CROCODILE IS CHASING ME I NEED YOU!"  Freddy : "Time to run to a random spot with someone spamming the call button."
Constant Screaming: The Episode
Mark: what happened. What happened? WHAT HAPPENED! WHAT HAPPENED!?!?
I agree with people this game has its issues, but it's your fault tr his game came out with all these bugs because you were begging, wanting to know when it would be out. The game has the main things you need to know for now and things will likely improve as the devs make bug fixes and overall updates for you. Stop complaining though and enjoy what they gave you in honestly amazing quality for now and enjoy the updates when they come!
the video URL says bruh in it
28:42 LMFAO WTH 😭✋
I love ya mark, but you make it so hard sometimes
The fact that the "ending" was suddenly displayed in a comic book style completely conflicts with how EVERY OTHER CUTSCENE is displayed, and then just how freddy was swiped aside in the end so quickly and without thought. Its just.... it feels like the devs didnt really care... the entire time the main character built up a relationship with him and then to have him slapped to death so fast and carelessly is so.. just so disappointing. And then Vanny. Just... Vanny. She was just there. Didnt really pose a threat most of the time. Mainly showing up just to remind the player that she still exsists. The pacing was just painful and it felt so rushed.  There were a few good parts. It felt polished in terms of map design but the gameplay was frustrating. The fact that the player could sequence break the game so easily and get to places that they weren't supposed to be yet really killed the immersion of the story. And the fact that the other animatronics showed very subtle hints of actual character (mainly with Roxy and how she was crying in her room) it felt like the game was hinting that maby the other animatronics weren't as evil as we thought. But nope, the main character still has to rip her to pieces too with no resolve to her possible conflicts. And the Vanessa/vanny reveal never happened. Its just "oooohh vanessa maaaaaaaby miiight be Vanny but who knows!" Theres no big reveal. Its just suddenly the night guard is gone and now vanny is here. Nothing really seemed to connect together and the cutscenes where just jarring and felt out of place with the gameplay. And dont get me started on the bugs. Holy shit the bugs. Everything in this game is wonky with bugs. It constantly rips you out of immersion.  Example: (You sneak across the pizza-plex floor, silently dodging the security bots as the emotionlessly roam the halls... you creep your way up the stairs and you hear a bone-chilling sound telling you that youve been detected! You spin around only to see Chica stuck and clipped halfway through the stairs while Freddy suddenly teleports right in front of you for an uncomfortable getaway.)
My kids were obsessed with this..
27:49
Freddy get me get  me "Freddy runs pass him" FREDDY FREDDY YOU  BITCH FREDDY 😂😂😂 28:42
Jumpscare List:  3:33 Moon 7:28 Moon  10:45 Moon 12:23 Moon 27:52 Security Bot 28:26 Security Bot 29:13 Monty  (reposted to keep it at the top, <3)
🌷My poor Roxy🌷
Mark is really not a bright boy
I think our king is suffering too much to sanity
28:43 is the best thing I have ever seen 😂
25:00 Plush Baby!
This game should be called "Five Nights with Freddy"
15:21 why vanny kinda bad tho 👀
u can go back to the stage where vanessa said to go
What does plan A mean, I’ve never seen that before
*”FREDDDAYYYY FREDDDAYYYYYY”*
Two questions,  1. How did Roxy get all crispy looking right before she loses her eyes? I've watched multiple playthroughs and can't see a scene that explains what got her so dirty looking? She doesn't look like that in the beginning of the game.   2. is there a reason Gregory can't just...hangout with Freddy until 6am? Like...I know he said its not safe to just pick a spot to hide cuz he will be found (debatable) he can just he near Freddy in Freddys room or something, then when someone dangerous comes by just hop in his belly? And just...chill till 6am.   Largest plot hole ever IMO. Or maybe I'm just dump and forgot a huge story piece I dunno
FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
She’s so fine
Mark: incessantly pressing the call button over and over again Also Mark: WHY DOES FREDDY KEEP RUNNING PAST ME As if it doesn’t work on a pseudo que system of going through every single call location in order and spamming the button SCREWS IT UP. I don’t normally get pissed off at mark during playthroughs of games, but him acting like this is making me want to literally punch something for some reason. As well as he consistently forgets the the directions and hints he was just given, such as during the moon part before 6 Freddy said charging stations wouldn’t work. Idk why but it was pissing me off for some reason. Edit: I realized why I was pissed. I was mad at the mechanics not working/working extremely poorly. It’s not mark’s fault Freddy kept running past him, it’s the games fault.
Well we almost made a full game... almost...
Mark screaming Freddy is now my alert.
Also, if you get all the bad animatronics done before 6 am you could probably get the true canny ending
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation??"   Holy shit he took the words right out of my mouth.
28:39 FREDDYYYYY!!!!
3:33 too 3:35 Feddy Got Ass Raped Bai Mr.Moon..
"where am I, Why am I here?" This game in a nut shell.
Mark: "Freddyyyyy, FREDDAAAYYYYYYYY"  Freddy: "Is someone talking?"
As Freddy said, the charging stations are disabled and can’t help you
“ you are…my superstar”
You also missed the part where it straight up tells you the recharging stations are not available in this sequence... like go back to your very first playthrough and see that's what it tells you... donkus.
Freddy was like I’m coming sike
Freddy : u can call me with that watch. also freddy : walk pass gregory*
You brokeded it...
Please do the Princess Quest arcade cabinets if you want the true ending, Mark.
Markiplier is in pain
I love mark but so many times he's ignored dialogue in the game or just forgets is frustrating. I feel like watching dora I scream at him THE RECHARGERS ARE OFFLINE! they said that lol....
6:55
wait if it’s six AM shouldn’t children and staff be coming back? ‘,:/ why couldn’t the staff come to help ‘,:(
Freddy:* dies* Mark: EEHEAAAARARAHAAEAAGE
Freddy sounds like Optimus Prime, I just realised that.
Is that the bite of 87!?
ngl hearing mark scream freddy at the top of his lungs and also seeing freddy run past him has to be two of the funniest things ive seen happen to mark XDDD
28:42 this better be in the compilation
For those wondering    Freddy Fazbear goes to where you FIRST call Him, with him unable to deviate from his path  That’s why he ran right past Mark
Mark literally screamed so loud it distorted his Microphone😂
Mark, increasing in pitch: FREDDIEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
28:40 Mark reaching notes I didn't even know existed.
when Gregory goes in Fred it reminds me of titan fall 2
22:34 ARE WE GONNA IGNORE THE FACT THAT THERE IS A BABY PLUSH?!?
I clearly remember, perhaps from last episode, the game stated that charging stations were disabled in the last 10 minutes.
miss..... vannyyyyyy
FREDDYYYYYYYY  I'M DYING
Spam this button: 28:45
This just turned into a rage game
22:14 mark said bitch 😭🥵
"There you are you 🗣️ASSHOLE!!!"
Do you wish to : stay,leave or VANNY
Lol 19:48 anybody read *the paper?* 😏
28:38 I WAS SCREAMING AND MY ANXIERTY LEVELS WERE SKY ROCKETING AND THEN FREDDY JUST IGNORING MARK GOT ME LAUGHING SO HARD
damn this game hard jank idk what was even going on
heads up this comment is just me ranting about the poor quality of this game:  its a little frustrating when it comes to the quality of the game honestly. more than half of a game that has a story to it should have a clear storyline that anyone, even people who havent even heard of it, should be able to pick up on and understand (one that can be explored as well for fans whether through secret codes, rooms, etc). this game does the opposite by just throwing us in without delving into who gregory is or how he got there, his relevance, ANYTHING and theres so many parts ive watched with mark's playthrough where there is just pure confusion not only for gameplay quality but like why anything is happening. its just so sad to see such an upgrade with graphics for a jumpscare game thats grown for YEARS suddenly drop any thought into the story. you dont just gain connections and world building through physically exploring the complex, theres gotta be SOME backround, expecially with the character you play as AND the ones they interact with, which we only see a little bit. theres no important relationship that gregory builds with freddy to make that sudden choice of staying, leaving, or VANNY (which are we not gonna talk about how choppy and just "what the heck just happened" that was??) gut-wrenchingly hard. anyways, theres SO MUCH MORE I COULD RANT ABOUT BUT THATS JUST BEGGING FOR THE LONGEST YOUTUBE COMMENT IN HISTORY
Early Access: It shows
PLEASE- the whole "FREDDDDDY" sequence has me dead 😂
Everyone was really excited for Vanny but we can all agree that Security Bots were the main antagonist  Edit: OMG I HAVE NEVER EVEN GOT PAST 20 LIKES! 10K IS AMAZING 🥳🥳🥳😱😱
That first ending is the most comically rushed thing I've ever seen in a video game. Jesus Christ.
3:27 Moondrop really did the hokey pokey on him 🥶
15:07 and 17:40 I literally stared to tear up like my heart *hurts* Freddy deserves better than this
Friendship ended with Freddy.  Also, very accurate summary - the game's story is some interesting moments not really tied together. And the endings are all pants.
I love how some endings were supposed to be sad but the comic strip just completely ruins it
At the beginning when Mark went up the elevator I heard the stomping and was thinking about how funny it would be if the door opened and it was just Moon Man standing there waiting for him
Freddy (dying): You are... my superstar... Mark: *WHEEEEZE*
Wow, this game really is half-assed crap, isn't it?
But in the Vanny ending, you could see Freddy had Monty's claws.
IT'S ALMOST WHAAAAT?
God what is with all these bugs? Did Scott sell the rights at some point? I feel like the game wouldn't be as bad if he was in charge. I think Mark is onto something about it being a different game.
Mark it's okay to say the game is bad. Like come on. When most people release a game they make sure it's FINISHED first.
11:10
28:45 his voice got a very higher pitch from saying FREADDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I love how mark just starts screaming at Freddy when he doesn’t come to help him 🤣
Just call marks new series overcomplecating fnaf security breach lmaoo
Freddy: "you are my superstar..." Me: *Loud Crying* "FREEEEEEDDDDYYYYYYY!!!!"
Mark: "I kno u enjoy my suffering."  Chica, Roxy, Monty, Vanny, Map Bots, Us Viewers: "Just a bit."
FREDYYYYY 😂
mark noo dont get old yet
I'd love to hear Mark sing, because his vocal range is amazing.
mark screaming "FREDAAAAYYYY" is now my therapy
the ending/s felt so rushed ngl
That comic section felt kinda outta place
Mark: let me charge Fredy Also Matk: hopes in and hopes out immediately
8:17 yes mark we love seeing you suffer in fnaf  Its hilarious 😂
I was watching in the bath and at one point cause of a jumpscare I flipped my phone but still somehow caught it 😳🙃😓
27:48 2x speed
"wet floor bots" are the real villains
Matpat yelling Musicman? 👎 Markiplier yelling Freddy 👍
DAMN FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYY
FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"what the up" got me cracking up
YO LOL WHEN Y SAID FREDDY YOu |____| |________|
27:54 where the best moment starts
I love how mark is constantly repeating himself
Looking at the ending where freddy died has left me mentally scarred
7:46 Mark's Version of the FNaF 6 ending
What happened? wHat happened? Wwhat happened? WhAt HaPpEnEd? wHAT happened
First if all: he watched a human get ripped up, teared up Second of all no matter what, it was too emotional and i even feel bad for Roxy  I'm left here like...: :0
no because i cried when freddy.. ugh
00:06  Dacia Sandero?
Freddy be like " "I don't like this kid" and leave mark
28:41 the moment you need Freddy he runs passed you 🤣🤣🤣
markipier things freddy is gonna save him. Freddy: what was i supposed to do again?
Mark: Man, they just created this whole theater area and never used it? Monty golf route: Am I a joke to you?
Markiplier dies beacuse of monty. Freddy: well im 50% guilty
the true ending is the ending with the stay choice where you stay and find out about the secrets of the pizzafaz and the fazbear entertainment company
At 27:21 there is something on the right moving
Mark: *oh my god FREEEDDDYYYYYYYY!!!* Freddy:                                       *Y'all hear somethin?*
Mark: I''ll find you  Me: Unlike Freddy who didn't find you  Hah
Roxanne Wolf is so hot. Never in the history of gaming has there been a hotter character. She is more than a robot wolf to me, she is a person. She is a little tease but she's basically my wife. The devs know what they did with that wolf. The aesthetic paired with her demeanor make her such an attractive character. Nothing gets me going better than a punk rock wolf chick. Every inch of her is so hot. Her thighs up to her midriff and her eyes. Every inch of her is perfection incarnate. I would save the game and let her catch me just to feel the intimacy between us. I crave more than lustful fantasies with her, I seek deep romantic involvement. The craftsmanship of her character surpasses everything I expected from this game. Her tone of voice and language choice formats her character. The choice of clothes with short shorts and the crop top which reveal her milky thighs and delectable midriff compliment her punk rock personality more. She is my wife, and nothing dissuades me from this fact.
mark:i know that you, for some reason enjoy my SuFfeRiNg me: he knows me so well :3
FFFFFFFREDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYY FREEEEADDDDYYYYYYYAYYY
The part when Freddy died made me sad but Marks wheeze helped LOL
This game was laughably bad
With the speculation surrounding the Clintons, & the allegations that they R intimately tied 2 a massive pedophilia ring interconnected with occult practices, The Last American Vagabond wanted 2 present the following case studies 2 show that the idea of a massive pedophilia ring @ the highest levels of power is very real & needs 2/B addressed.  — Last American Vangard
Monty: *Trying to kill Gregory* Freddy: "So how's your day been? "
WHY IS THIS ENDING SO SAD ZSXDRYVGBUHNI FREDDY NOOOO
Well if you remember, the whole incident with Scott Cawthon occurred, I think during development? Could have been what impacted the game
…I can’t be the only one who found the comic ending extremely cringy. The whole Freddy sequence feels like fanservice for people who got attached to the murder bots lol. It feels like bad fanfiction
Patch to stop people opening doors? Hahaha, I think NOT.
Wtf 15:28
28:41 PLEASE FREDDIE PASSING BY MARK AND JUST IGNORES HIM
jesus that ending lmao
No one: These comments:
Mark : FREDDYY *Freddy finally shows up but walks up the stairs£ Mark: FREDDY YOU BEETCH
mark: FREDDY, FREDDY WHERE ARE YOU- *suddenly, freddy runs off somewhere else after passing mark*
That actually hurt a bit watchin Freddie get disassembled
😀
Bro when he was asking "are you serious?" I imagined him asking Sirius Black from Harry Potter is he really was Sirius 😭😭😭
Mark every second: how did I miss that
I cant wait for some markiplier animated for this xD
Watching these videos makes me wish I chose a different name, I feel like Mark is screaming at me lmao
Mark: "FREDDYYYYYYY" Freddy: "yall hear somethin??"
Amazing.
I love it when he screams freddy
This series can be summed up to the game telling mark something and mark completely ignoring it and getting frustrated
Hi Mark Day 22
The alternate title of this episode is "Mark screams the same thing over and over again."
The game has been doing so well except the last part in that ending , those scenes felt way too rushed and ruined the whole game. They should have gives Vanny more screentime or make that Freddy scene more dramatic.
Lol you deserve that!!! 🤣 Stop hitting the button a million times 🤣
yes a new video
Mark there are SEVERAL endings, good, bad and secret. Try to find them all!!!
Moonman:**exists**  Mark:let me in...LET ME IN...F R E D D Y   L E T  M E  I N!
The KING OF FNAF is back
You know how you got the flashlight battery upgrade? Apparently it is possible to get battery upgrades for freddy, I saw it in someone else's video and I am not 100% sure if you can actually do it or not.
"you are my superstar" SHUT IT IM CRYING 😭
What happened….
28:43 I died XD
New challenge: take a shot everytime mark says 11:34 “you serious”😀
5:00 I think Freddy is a little lost 🤣
28:38
Someone has to animate that Mark and FREDDDEEEEEEYYYYY thing lmao
Where did he get the eyes from again? Well the new once
Man u deserve a like:)
Mark:*frantically calling Freddy upstairs* Freddy:*trying to run upstairs to get to where he was called* Mark:*dies from running downstairs*How could Freddy do this to me?
Mark: “I will find you”   Everyone: “Cool, please do that”🖤🖤🖤
you have to speed run it now
this has been a 50/50 combination of mark not paying any attention and the game being buggy and poorly laid out, and it’s kind of aggravating to watch
28:42 I cannot stop laughing HAHA!
mark: FREDDY Freddy: Thank you, next
The “VANESSAAAAAAAAAA” literally just makes my day better 😂
8:18 this is totally me🤦🤣
Mark: GET ME IN GET ME IN! Freddy: NOPE MARK: FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!!! Makes me laugh and I love it
holy shit did u really cry omg i can feel the pain of attachment
28:24
The way that Freddy and Monty was walking down the stairs together like two golf dads got me so good.
Mark: Calls Freddy Freddy: Takes the stairs Monty: Way ahead of him Freddy: Waits his turn Mark: Freddy, DON'T WAIT YOUR TURN-
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This game is so overrated, Vanny ending was terrible
28:42  Mark: “FREDDY!!!" Freddy: “see ya chump.”
Also .. is mark stupid with the whole Freddy thing?
FREDDDYYYYYY
your are good creator
driven to the point of insanity where he forgot the game told him "Charging Stations are currently down" lmao
man, the last minute i have not laughed so hard in a long time :p :) thanks mark.
damn, seductive Vannessa is my new speed
12:43 vannessa: go check the main stage markpier: i did that there was nothing there me: uhh she told to meet at the main stage to get killed by moon guy she trapped us
Every comment:  Mark: Somebody:
Nothing can hide from me moon man in the distance having not outline....
I feel like he's just making the final boss
why did vanessa sound like she was trying to seduce you when she said go to the main stage lmao
13:03 “Y o u C a n ‘ t”  Mark, your inner Afton is showing
God, that vanny ending was one of the WORST fucking things I've ever seen.
Freddy:  if moon man comes I can't protect you.  Mark(in freddy): HOW DID MOON MAN GET ME?!
Mark: FREDDYYYYYYY !  Freddy: *Fuck this shit i'm out !*
just the opening alone killed me, it just got more funnier from there as the video went on. love this mans content.
NO YOU ARE MY SUPERSTAR!
NOOOOOO FREDDY!!!!
I WILL MISS YOU TOO FREDDY! 😢
the start of this video was really funny to me for some reason
we got fucking iron giant'ed by a damn video game. yes i was crying over it lol
FREDDEYYYYYYYY
18:13 THATS FUCKING EXACT OUT OF EXACTLIEST EXACTLIES WHAT I THOUGHT
Mark I love you but god watching you play this is so frustrating bc you don’t listen to instructions!
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT MARK SCREAMING FOR FREDDY AND HE JUST SPRINTS RIGHT PAST MARK
honestly it seems like a lot of marks deaths were cause by bad game design and that makes it 10xs more frustrating . like why was this game released like this. so many areas are stupidly big for no reason, there's things that make zero sense (like Freddy mentioning Gregory's injury and taking him to first aid only for nothing to happen with that) and the glitches while quirky at times cause a lot of frustration.  If a delay meant things got patched then so be it. I'm sure people wouldn't have minded waiting longer for a functioning game.
This game sucks doesn’t it?
guys i think the first ending is the good one because you destroy the glitctrap=(evil)
I 100% agree with Mark's theory about there being a game development issue. Maybe the devs were rushed to a deadline and didn't have the time to add everything they needed to? It really does feel super piecemeal.
May today be a joyous and peaceful one for you and those whom you care for and that care for you, Dear Reader. uwu
Hey Mark, if you want to get the best ending you have to play all Princess Quests games, and the third one is in Vannys Office, you should really try it, I would love to see your reaction on it!
Man, the devs actually managed to make you care about Freddy. The same Freddy that was your arch nemesis for nearly 9 years now.  Mad props, especially the facial animators, they did a damn fine job.
the pinnacle of this episode was mark screaming his life out for Freddy   *FREDDY YOU BASTARD*
at the last part of the video, where mark is yelling for Freddy to come and save him from Monty, i like to think there's some fast paced Mexican music in the background
27:56 The best part of this episode starts from here xD
spring trap comes bac in a difrent enden
For three minutes mark screamed at the top of his lungs "FREDDY"
Unpopular opinion but this game isnt even scary, everything is is so vibrant and cartoony he really lost the vibe since game 1, that on was so visceral and dark, and also described the death in a gruesome way (getting stuffed in a metal animatronic) this one doesn't even hint how they kill you, brain ulcer from loud screech or something?
"Dang it Freddy don't wait your turn" that's gotta be one of the more funny lines in this playthrough XD
wait bc i literally cried when he said ”you are mu superstar” 😭😭😭😭😭
good like somuchhorror
To sumarize the daycare chase squence... "FREDDY!"
Okay I’m just saying I’m pretty like 100% sure Vinny is actually a human working for…the rabbit as Freddy said in one of the last episodes “ not anymore “ to Gregory saying “ I saw a rabbit person “ so Vanny is working for the rabbit animatronic who idk what happened to him maybe he was replaced or was ugly cause I’ve seen pictures of him he’s hideous TvT so that’s probably for all the disappearances which vanny yeeted them and I think the children are in Freddy, chica, Monty, and Roxy that’s why Freddy is so cautious about them and care about them and calls them his “ friends “.
I love how Mark gave Freddy a new voice box that stuns animatronics, but doesn’t use it.
"i know that you, for some reason, enjoy my suffering" mark knows us so well!
15:45 Mark : What...happened? Me : Freddy got fingered 😆🃏
0:03 XD 28:42 XD the screams
About his rant on how he thinks the game should have played difrently: it could have changed styles because of the whole thing with Scott's retirement the game was most likely passed to new devs so there could have been a few gameplay/story tweek's
The game: Recharge stations are offline   Also the game: Go to a recharge station
Mark still didn't try to use option LEAVE
Someone is going to animate 28:00 & onwards. I just know it.
Freddy rejected mark
I swear that Mark's starting to remind me of MattPat
this game is just the fake fnaf 3 leaks but into a game I have only just realised
about what happened when you got out of freddy is that either moon crawled up to freddy and take you out of his body or freddy taking you out his chest cavity.    And About the stage one, Vanessa lures you in the main stage so that moon could usually get to you much easier ( With freddy too )
Bruh i nearly broke my teeth at 11:00
27:53 to 29:14: The most intense part of the entire game
The way Freddy SPRINTED PAST mark up the stairs was comedy gold
Freddy's voice is so enthusiastic and enjoyable to listen to. He a very good boi.
Hey, just a tip, Freddy goes to the EXCACT location where you press the Call Button, not to your location. So while running away and calling him, you’re actively running away from where he’s going. That’s why he ran right past you like that.
Mark: *choose "Vanny" option* Me: u know what, this isn't gonna end well..
am i the only one that thought that THE BUTTON ON THE MAIN STAGE WAS WHAT THE REWARD WAS ABOUT? mark losing his mind gives me anxiety.
“Do you wanna stay” “vanny”
The credits have soooo many QA testers and this is a release version??? Damn.
I like Security Breach, it obviously had a lot of effort and time put into it. However, it has many issues and like when mark was saying that maybe there was an issue in development, I agree. Security Breach was under development during a jarring time, and I think that's when Scott left too. Yes, I'm aware Scott is still somewhat there to guide them, but the way he polishes things weren't entirely there. I hope Security Breach is a learning experience for Steel Wool and they can improve upon this.
18:05 the choke of disbelief
28:20
⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️Vanessa is the person you play in fnaf btw if you didn't know ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
merry Christmas
Mark: Get me in you Me: Uhh…. WHAT?!
Can we all agree the scariest thing in this game is now moonman
"did they ran out of budget for the last animation?" BYEEAHHAHAHAHAH THAT ENDED ME
the endings so funny xD he waited his turn
haven't clicked the links and never will <3
Love drinking coffee and watch mark play fnaf for the nostalgia it’s a sweet feeling
Freddy: *Dies* Mark: *wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeze*
This games so bad rn, rather wait months for the bugs to be fixed first
When mark was saying “FREDDY I need your help” freddy didn’t come and then he was screaming “ FRRrEeeEDdDdyyYyY” because he passed him 🤣
This game is awful lol
Remember to look for a red plad shirt mark
WAIT A MINUTE WAS THAT A DRAWING OR MURAL OF BONNIE ON THE WALL IN THE THEATER
How did O get here....have no idea what is going on 🤣🤣🤣
28:42 is way too funny 😭
28:40 is the best part.
okay but when mark said a red hare my mind was blown like the gears were turning way too fast
"You can't trick me! I've got supervision!" Yeah, Freddy's my chaperone!
Wow... this game is... extremely all over the place. FNAF is a classic, but based off how buggy this is and the train wreck of that ending, Scott should probably stick to the classic type of point and click game style...
if you click the choice vanny there is another ending instead of disassembling vanny you can get the true ending by playing princess quest 3
HAHAHHA I ALSO THOUGHT THE SAME WHEN MARK SAID "DID THEY RAN OUT OF BUDGET?!"  I CANT STOP LAUGHING
Why is nobody talking about how mark didnt use chica's voice box for anythingggg
The chase begins 27:56 o: 29:14 Epic Rage 2021 :D poor freedy XD
Vanessa: "Gregory, I think you deserve a reward. Go check the main stage." My masculinity: "Yo, where's this stage at tho?"
The Freddy scream actually got me. Monty sure is fast
this franchise became 100 to horrendous like wtf 4 years of production with triple A company team.... sad
The intro man XD
Why must they play the emotions;w;  Anyone else get emotionally attached to Freddy?
I feel like every time Mark hits the summon freddy button. Freddy goes to every location that Mark hits the q button. Thats why he goes all over the place
Saddest anime deaths…number 10
this game is a joke
good one like  good markplier good
28:37 MY FAVOURITE PART- OMG XD
this is one confusing game but it's awesome at the same time
Mark, a lot of the areas like the Fazbear Theater that you said was going to be used but wasn't. There are multiple endings, 5 as we know right now, before the credits there are stars, that is the rating of the ending that you got, you got rating 2 I think. So, the 'unused' areas are actually areas that hold secrets with the vanny story and others. Usually the bags that you find are near secrets, like BB world, the game mentioned in the bag you found in the theater. There are also tape recordings that you can find that reveal Vanny's childhood.
"Good News! It's Almost a Cluck" - Glamrock Freddy, 2021 Ngl, that got me for some reason XD
Can't wait for 27:55 to be animated
29:25 Freddy ran past you😂
WHY DOES GREGORY LOOK LIKE OIKAWA FROM HAIKYUU😭✋✋ IS THIS OIKAWAS CHILDHOOD?!😭👏
This game had every opportunity to be PHENOMENAL.. But it was rushed. Had they taken more time this could have been flawless. It just seems very half assed a lot of time. Hopefully they update soon and fix things!
When someone makes a animation video on mark playing fnaf security breech they better keep The monty chase
The way she says check the main stage is so alluring
28:43 why do feel that freddy did that on purpose?
they did not break him, they just made him go to the place you originally call him. not to where you currently are. he has no way to know where you are, only where you ping him from.
Damn, Freddy pretty dumb
where's the jumpscare timestamp comment when is needed😭
That entire unintentional chase sequence with Monty was probably the most suspenseful part so far…
What who the fuck enjoying your suffering
Markiplier: “I will find you” Me: *sad because he hasn’t found me ^
Did he completely ignore the fact that it says that he CAN'T use the recharge station
That was a really sloppy ending
The game:the recharge station cannot help you. Mark: ARE YOU SERIOUS?????
Wait, there are disappearances?  I know this is five nights at freddy's so of course there would be missing people.  But I would have liked to see some better indication of that.
DAAAAMN! VANNY LOOKIN KINDA THH...  THCARY!!!  sorry, i have a lisp.
...was that supposed to be a Silent hill style joke ending with the comic, or did they actually just run out of money? the hell were they smoking at steel wool?
Ok, I was surprised that chicas face wasn’t burned into his computer screen, then the blaster, then just the game over screen, and now I’m surprised that the entire game isn’t.  Or really, any of these games. Like, can you imagine how long he must play these for? Even on his longest episodes of security breach some of it is always cut out, mostly because of restarting and long walks. Speaking of though, he also probably has to restart a lot of things, especially considering that he forgets to save sometimes or he can’t save at all. This poor man has honestly probably wasted a years time of his life on these games lol 😂😂
There are many endings. You just happened to chose the Freddy death one
Some years ago…I didn’t know there is some YouTuber named markiplier   And…I was watching a video called “top 20 YouTuber” And….I was not interested in any of those youtubers  Until….I heard mark’s deep voice…and I was like…”I GOTTA SEE HIS VIDEOS”   so…all thanks to his deep voice I got to see these such amazing videos
Mark: FREEEDDDEYY!!! FREDDY: Hold on I'll( quickly remembered that he laughed at his own death) your on your own superstar
knowing how the animated cutscenes look im happy that they went with a comic book style for the endings
the pacing of this is absolutely fucking hilarious. man. what were the devs thinking?
Freddy running past Mark at the end when Monty was right on his ass was so damn funny
Merry Christmas Mark :D
Mark : Screaming for his life for freddy Freddy : oooh stairs
yo you didn't notice the princess quest III on the security room? where you get the bad ending when you press the button?
Damn, Freddy got his ass beat....  On a serious note...what the hell was that Vanny end though?
28:42 needs to be nominated as the funniest Markiplier moment of 2021.
Holy shit that ending almost made me die from laughing too hard 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Best moment in this video: FREEEEDDDDDDYYYYYYY
mark, i love you but out of all the games you have played how did you not know that the game wanted you to say "fuck vanesa" then go to the entrance, something happens then you only have one option, go to the main stage, you did it out of order so you ended up wasting time and effort.
When the game TOLD you to run, You run Mark🤣🤣.And the funny thing is Everysingle let's player i watched they escaped with no getting Lost or Jumpscares by moon drop.
When everything is about to be under control but freddy run passed him so everything went out of control 😂 28:38
No one:  Mark: Get me in you, I need to be in you.
HOLY SHIT THESE COMIC ENDINGS ARE SO LOW BUDGET. I'M SO DISAPPOINTED.   Mark you did a great job. Freddy is best boy. Luck Gregory, I hate him.
Freddy being excited that Gregory stayed is giving me serotonin
How did Roxy not see Gregory when he was hiding??? She can see through walls!! What plothole is this?
When Freddy ran right past him 😂😂
You could have just stayed hidden around that corner at 28:57 and called Freddy there. Once both made it down the stairs, Freddy would have run past Monty and reached you first.
I hate it when he doesn’t listen to the game
it would be pretty cool that mark will find us cus I whant to asc a lot of questions 👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
I cried tf
Nobody:  Moondrop: *IT IS PAST YOUR BEDTIME!*
28:43 Freddy be like Gregory she said she was home alone
Is it me or some of the parts are re edited
i will not click the link so daddy will find me, come and find me daddy!
Man that ending is some End of Evangelion type shit
YooooooooooooYooooooo
I felt bad when they ripped Freddy to pieces and I did not expect Vanny to get murdered by Gregory.
Whats crazy is when my the time said 5:55 am I checked my phone and it said the same thing
WTAF is this game. Like seriously never seen such an incoherent mess
FREDDYYYYY 😂😂😂😂
10:50 that jumpscare scared me so bad that i accidentally shook the drink i was holding and now im covered in juice
"FREEEEEEDDDYYY" 😭
28:42 best moment 🤣🤣
18:10 bookmark
I can not express how much I feel like I'm about to have a heart attack... Every time those damn security bastards- I can't... ;~; XD I feel the anxiety so bad right now, I'm binging so it is worse. Also merry christmas! :3
Freddy just ignoring mark when he needed Freddy was the best betrayal ever
Freddy: you are my superstar  me: crying like a bxtch
THERES A SECRET ENDING TO THE GAME AND EASTER EGGS
You look, talk, and act so much like my grandfather-😂
Mark really made the beginning intro into a YTP
Merry Christmas everyone! 🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅🎄🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅
22:00
its around 28:44 where i started pissing myself laughing because of fredys stupid mechanics and Marks rapid high pitch screaming while seemingly we both being in fright cause of the situation
Freddy: can see anything Also Freddy: I do not see mark 😎😎
JUMPSCARE TIMESTAMPS pt 7 3:32 - moon scare 7:29 - moon scare 10:45 - moon scare 12:23 - moon scare 27:53 - bot scare 28:26 - bot scare 29:14 - monty scare
Why Vanny looks hot tho?
Seeing mark rage in games like the old days is such a huge nostalgia.......
FREDDDDYYYYYY
17:37 Freddy and Gregory : _having a sad, somber moment together before his death_ Mark : _Dehydrated Confused Squealing_
Mark's theory (his game theory) about this game being rushed might not be far off. The glitchy mechanics are so obvious Playtesters would've encountered them during first play. I'm pretty sure Steel Wool rushed this out due to Fan Hype and Demand (We really should stop threatening Devs to release their games early huh ?) And because of that the game feels unpolished and lacking. Some areas aren't even used beside for collectible hiding spots (they probably made the map first before actually making Gameplay and Story and when they realized there's not much time left. They decided to just make collectibles in place of the story. Update : Mark's theory is correct. I just did some research and they were supposed to delay the game but in fear of consumer backlash (a game that's delayed is eventually good but a game that is rushed is bad forever, guys !) So they needed to release it... Such a shame too, if only they did some minor bug fixing, playtesting, and AI fixing. The game should be good, the game is enjoyable but the bugs can be annoying and softlock you from the game.
Did you see someone walking during Freddy telling you to leave the store I believe it was vanny
Bruh "Did they run out of budget?" Literally everyone has been saying that 😂😂😂
Mark wasn't wrong. The game definitely cut corners, and relies on overpriced DLC just to "finish" the product--and even that is a stretch. This franchise is long from over, and this game is just a piece in the puzzle. Still, it lacks closure. It's a shame. Gaming is a business. Making games is a business. Watching people play said games is the new norm. But what does it say when said game is half baked, and released to the public nonetheless? EA went down this route with The Sims 4, YEARS ago, and people still sneer at it. Brand new games today shouldn't be going down that path. That short-term profit is gained, at the cost of gaining notoriety.
I swear the Freddy being taken abart scream hurts my soul.
Me at 10: Watching Mark play FNaF is so great. Me at 14: Ew, I’m too old for that. Me at 17: Watching Mark play FNaF is so great.
i love how mark just has a blank face when he sees the ending
I somehow got spoiled for the ending i hope you can get it
Mark's descent into madness is always a great spectacle, especially when he pauses the video to tell how he went cucù
The first animation bit to fight Vanny came out of nowhere for me and the sudden change to a comic type of deal, that hasn't been seen in the game in any scenes before that, was so weird for me. I didn't follow the story anymore and felt like there wasn't even one by the end of that, which is kinda sad as the game stil seemed fun even though it has some bugs
Markiplier all episodes: doing his best not to say that the game is an unoptimised garbage with unfinished story. Chat: HAHA FREDE GOES BRRR
18:01 IS NO ONE LAUGHING FROM THE WHEEZING LMAO
Hey Markiplier mate, wishing you a wonderful Merry Christmas to you and your family and friends.
Anyone going to tell him it's "red herring", herring as in the fish?
10 seconds in and this is my favourite series 😂😂
15:27 why does freddy have monty’s hands even tho mark didn’t do that mission yet???????
Mark asking “What happened?” 50 times 😩😩🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hey Mark have you ever thought about finishing oneshot?
“I will find you.”  I’d believe that a bit more if you hadn’t spent 90 percent of this game (especially at the beginning) being lost every five seconds.
So did the robots literally just pull Vanny's limbs and insides apart considering what happened to Freddy?
Gregory: "Miss.... Vanny... Miss Vanny... miss vannyyy.''
Never gonna forget that scream for Freddy now 🤣
Fnaf: throws an emotional scene at mark Mark: laughs
The patch didn’t seem to do anything and the game seems a BIT MORE GLITCHY!! Plus why are there SOOO many Security bots?!? I mean the place it huge but Jesus!!!
5:42  fFRÆDDEÈEEYi
Is it just me or everytime he does an edit scenario it feel like Darkiplier. I don't know man but it feels demonic. I could be totally wrong though and Mark just wanted to make a cool edit just take this as a thought then fact.
25:12 well, Scott was cancelled on Twitter for a series of past donations he'd made to right leaning politics. I believe this situation may of led to the development becoming super rushed because it may have went into someone else's hands, or because Scott just couldn't handle making the game anymore because of his cancelation.
28:39 Seeing Freddy run up the stairs completely ignoring Gregory is the funniest thing ever.
the "lets all go to the lobby" reference is great you can tell the graphic designers put a LOT of effort into this game
When Mark was yelling for Freddy and Freddy ran past him like "Did you hear something?" 😂🤣
To everyone confused about the endings or the entire game in the comments, please go watch Dawko or 8-bit-Ryan play the game; Mark sadly didn't do it justice while they actually had me watching with my mouth hanging open
WOW that Vanny ending was pretty lame 💀 what the heck, feels so easy and lazy
Man this game is one of those games that Mark just can't seem to understand 😂
I just suddenly wondered. Where are the fire exits? Aren't you legally required to have them? I mean... I'm pretty sure you do (I know some countries, even first world countries don't actually have those laws, but I doubt this takes place in one of those countries).
Can someone please explain the plot of this game, i’m legit so confused this just doesn’t seem to make any sense and there’s so so so much potential but the game feels hella unfinished :( only a few parts of this game feel fully fleshed out and it feels like mark feels bored playing this game sometimes and I really don’t blame him. Like don’t get me wrong this game has some good concepts and parts but also I think I would get so bored playing this….
All this time Freddy was actually a bad guy lol
Lost my shit when Freddy ran past when Monty was chasing Mark XD
Hey mark! I just wanted to let you know there is another ending, let’s just say, you haven’t seen him yet in security breach. Hint: it’s close to Bonnie. But.. I give you a warning, you won’t realise him at first but when you see something in particular you’ll realise it’s him. :) happy playing!
I refuse to believe they did this to all the fnaf characters
Freddy: *Getting torn apart by staff bots Me, a straight girl: “Vanny kinda bad tho”
This game is such a buggy mess jeez. It boarders on unplayable since there’s so much confusion. Thankful that mark makes it so entertaining
milk
I love how he explained the pun of Red Hareing lmao
so that Vanny ending is fucking out of nowhere in terms of not really having a lead up and then just abruptly ends.
"FREDDY YOU BITCH, FREDDY, FREDDIIIIE"....😂😂😂
“Jesus answered him, ‘Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.’” John 3:3 ESV
23:53 everyone loves Sundrop
this has got to be the shittest fnaf game
Animate this lol
28:34 Freddy was never our friend
28:40 Mark: Freddy get me in! FREDDEY FREDDEY YOU BITCH LET ME IN  FREDEYYYYYYY . . . . . .  Also Mark: oh ily so much Freddy your my best pal.
Me: Mark is gonna pass him it’s ok. 27:50 TW . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Also me: *having a literal seizure after getting jump scared and pressing a crocs add*
Haha I carkit up
I'm probably in the minority but the screaming at the top of his lungs is insufferable to me. I had to watch this at 1 volume on my TV because of how grating it was :/
Does mark not know that scott stopped working?
You can find me possibly it's a win win situation u can kill me and I get to meet my fav YouTuber lol
2 freddy
I could not count the amount of times I screamed "DEAL WITH FUCKING MOON MAN!" during this lmao
Number 19 on trending! Let's go
28:42  Mark: FREDDY!! Gimme in gimme in  Freddy: *runs straight by and past Monty too*
Nice video 👏👏👏
at 28:10 - 28:51 Mark is screaming at the top of his lungs for Freddy to save him and I've been rewatching that part so many times.
Disassemble Vanny.  This kid, just told ALL of the robots in the pizzarea, to rip a female human being to shreds with their bare hands.
to bad scott stopped making these due to biggots not liking his political stance
What an absolute breakdown
I love Lixian so much, but sometimes its nice to see some video’s Mark has edited too ^^
I’ve watched the Mandalorian too much cause I really thought Freddy was about to say “This is the way,” instead of “this is where I must stay.”
You are aware of the FNAF Scott Cawthon situation right Mark? The game got handed over to Steel Wool before completion
Freddy: ba-bye  *freddy go upstairs*
Anyone else realize Gregory says dissapearences but it's not mentioned in this game yet at this point????
Mark's the only person I've seen so far actually got to the main stage like Vanessa says, and it went so wrong
I really hope they rework and use some of the unused areas with DLC. I really don’t have the patience to play thru this as is but I still think it has some really cool moments and a lot of potential. Hoping for a no man’s sky kind of thing
When Freddy passed Mark tho XD
27:51 to 28:45 *THE NIGHTMARE BECOMES REALITY*
The way freddy just bypassed Mark and Mark completely losing it. I CAN'TTTT
Merry christmas Mark. Stay safe at home.
The whole series has been enjoyable, then when I hear FREDDAAYYYYYYYY!!!!!! YOU BACHHHHHHH FREDDDIIIIIEEEEEEEE DONT WAIT YOUR TURN HELP MEEEE. I was dying 💀
Watching Freddy get disassembled was terrifying. This is one of the few games I had a genuine reaction to something happening. Just like with chica, my jaw dropped
When you hit the Freddy button 18 billion times in a row it's probably glitching Freddy out. Just so you know.
You will never find me
I'm a little behind on these episodes but I have a thought: You're upgrading the shit outta Freddy which is currently a good thing, but should Freddy turn against you he's gonna be the ultimate obstacle.
I beg u do the secret ending.
I KNOW. 3:27 I don't need you to tell me that D:
the bots at the end omg LMAOOOO
Scott: I've got tons of cash and all the time in the world to finish my latest creation. Also Scott: Fuck it! Lets replace 1/3 of the game with comic panels and cut out scene transitions so everything feels disjointed...
plesae do part 9
Come find me pls
🐓
Every time I hear markiplier scream and run's it feel's like I'm watching the classic scooby Doo and there were funny moment's
I don't think mark have get security lv 10 so... there's maybe have more content to do.
release FNAF Security Breach Steelwool cut?
19:46 Me: *pauses to read the lore* The lore: "Yackity smackity blah blah blah"
i need a compilation of freddy being glitched out
The elevator music 🎶 *mmmwuuuahh! Takes this game and the player to another level
the lore is good, but my god this game is so unpolished
I hope you can find me better than Freddy found you 🤣 Sorry had too
28:12 this entire seguiment is pure comedy gold! From the zig zag at the doors to the dramatic stairway scene!
Those last couple minutes were intense, horrifying, and hilarious, all in equal measure lol
absolutely 0 consistency in the broken mess of a game.
I always laugh when you stare at the little yellow robots they make "vine boom sound effect"
Mark: "Freddy! FREDDYYYY!" Also Mark: *Rapidly slamming call key not realizing it goes to the point YOU CALL HIM* More of Mark: "Yeah Hotfix Patch this morning... it's broken completely now"
The true ending is the good vanny ending u achieve it by playing the Princess quest in order from 1 to 3or4
Mark just 1 time only once you need to call freddy
Holy cow Freddy running past him in his time of need was funny! Sad to see Mark panic so hard, could've just hid out in the bathroom and waited for Freddy to come, or just hide in one of the garbage bins until Monty left.
HAR HAR MARK.  Red Harring.  Go sit in the corner
Good news! It is almost a cock🐻🍆
Went to the trouble to get chica's voice box, but never really used it to stun animatronics
Mark is wrong about some aspect about the game he thinks that the game has a lot of areas wich are not used but the true is that this game offers many option to cover the objectives of it, like for example in a point the game offers the option to go for a laser gun or a camera to defend yourself. these areas that mark never explored on his main campaign is because those areas belongs to the option that he didn´t took. this game is amazing in that aspect, in giving the player totally different routes to choose and complete the game. Another good example are the exits, there are multiple exits in the game and depending wich exit you choose, the endings also changes at the end.
THAT INTROO THO XDDDDDD
Freddy: gets torn to shreds Mark: watches him Also mark: what happened?
I laughed so hard when Monty was chasing mark and freddy just ran past him as he screams his name 😭✋
I think that the problem with the game is that (hear me out) there wasn’t enough time for work to be put into the game. I know that this game has been pushed back an immense amount if times but i think that with more time more things would be incorporated into the game. I believe that the game was pushed back so much because of all the detail in this game but there wasn’t enough time to fully incorporate it all into the game.
I personally feel like SB should be recalled, and to give the devs a proper chance to finish the game and fix bugs. Now that the fans got an experience , they are no longer so needy for the release. They see the things that need to be fixed, and want more than anything to just play a finished masterpiece of a game. I know for myself that I would be willing to play the same game over again if everything is paced better and things are fixer. The devs just need time, but was worried about fans response to pushing things back.
22:34 Baby plushie on the shelf!
Mark: FREDDY!!!  Freddy: We do a little trollin Gregory
No one’s gonna talk about “it’s a cock” ? No? Just me? Okay.  I’m 5 Cause I died. 🤣
im at 8:00 and does he realize he can left click in freddy to stun other bots it said that when he put the voice box in
29:20 I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO DO IT ALL AGAIN
freddy must complete first request before next one. Mark Spamming it was like making 100 waypoints it has to complete before coming to him. it makes for great content
Someone has probably already pointed this out, I'm sure - but I'd like to bring up the factor in this game that really clarifies something that was asked a lot in the other games. WHY??????? WHO WOULD BRING THEIR KIDS HERE?? Well, now we get to see it from the perspective OF a kid. Yeah, I mean, the other animatronics are scary to Gregory, but it's already been stated by Freddy that something isn't right with them right now. Look at how kind and fatherly Freddy is to Gregory - of course people wanna bring their kids here. Yeah, it's a little creepy, a few murders here and there - but those all happened a really long time ago. And the animatronics are so friendly to the kids, THAT'S why the kids love it. That's why they want to come to the pizzaria. Because Freddy calls you a superstar, and Roxy races with you, and Monty plays golf.   When you look at things through the perspective of a little kid, who WOULDN'T wanna go here?
I lost my shiz when Freddy ran right past you, and then proceeded to give Monty a helping push to chase you even faster! X'''D
Freddy just straight up running past on the stairs was one of the funniest moments🤣
Freddy: I can see everything nothing can escape me now  Mark : F R E D D Y!  Freddy: I have no idea where this Gregory is- (as he runs past mark)
I love the darkest dungeon style narration lmao
I absolutely HATE the Vanny option. The game is so bugged that Staff bot joke dialogues sometimes just  doesn't work.
Everyone else saw that dorr glowing to right
28:42 Freddy was like "sike"
Other gamers: Cry at freddys death  Mark: *Dryest confused laugh in existence*
5:03 and 28:40, holy crap X3
The game is too big, specifically the map. The map like mark said does not need to be that big. They could have easily cut a third of the map and spent that time polishing off the bugs, saving money for more kill animations for the animatronics, made those fun unique encounters feel less few and far between, cut down on you having to haul ass everywhere with a stamina bar the size of a twix bar, and so on. I think they kinda blew a little too much time and money on the environment and while granted it is a very pretty and detailed environment with a few good secrets they didn't have enough money or time left to fill that empty space with anything of substance. Making it feel like a pie with only half the filling and twice the crust
*Mark when freddy is literally ripped to shreds:* 😆🤣😝 *Mark when freddy cant find him in time:* * betrayed screaming *
the utter frustration and betrayal mark felt when freddy ran right past him like he didn’t exist will never not be funny
find me and do what mark ;)
😂😂😂
18:08 i laughed so damn hard because that's what i thought
congrats you found 1 of 7 endings, you can leave and get another one (2), leave after getting all the parts and (i think) get the happy ending (3), play and complete the princess warriors games (all 3) (4), and there are a couple others that can be completed but im not sure how to get those, but i know there are 7
"did they run out of budget" No but it honestly feels like it.
I feel like he goes to the area summoned, when you frantically mash the button I think he derps up.
😂😂😂😂😂
Mark: "Freddyyyyy, FREDDAAAYYYYYYYY"  Freddy: "Is someone talking?"
the way freddy ran past mark he was like “baby you’re not even there you’re an hallucination.” 💀
Vanessa: Starts speaking to Gregory with a husky voice.  Gregory: Is a literal child.  Me: Hmmmm... my schmentai senses are tingling.
Mark: “Freddy i need you” Freddy: “I’m gonna pretend i didn’t hear that”
Game and story kinda shit
Security breach is the fnaf version of cyber punk
27:50 is the start of the greatest betrayal and yet funniest Mark babling I have ever witnessed 😂
Can't wait to see how will the game theorist explain this mess of a story
"Find an exit!" Mark (completely forgetting the literal front door exists and is nearby): "Let’s head into the basement and find the loading dock." Moon: "He chose... poorly."
Lmao the rage
me and my f*cking autism getting annoyed af that mark's running around getting stressed about freddy not coming im like "NOOOO FREDDY GODDAMN WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO TO EVERY SINGLE PLACE WHERE GREGORY CALLS YOU HOLY SH*T AAAAAAAAAAA"
@7:37 *insert Mickey mouse wa happened*
Have your sins been forgiven today and forever?  Think about this.   The God of the bible,  the One True God made us to worship him, obey him, and enjoy him forever.   We break His laws daily by not putting Him first, not thanking Him like we should, we lie, we lust, we have sex before marriage, we dishonor our parents, we covet things other people have, we take God's name and use it in vain,  we use it in a low manner,  sometimes as a cuss word,  (God is holy and even His name is holy),  we don't love like we should, etc.  In doing so we're saying He's not a good provider,  He's a liar,  He's untrustworthy,  He's not worthy of praise.   All these things and more are counted against us.   The bible says God is the just judge of the world and one day He will settle the score for all the wrong we've done.  God is holy meaning He is righteous (morally perfect in thought, word,  and deed)  It also means He is set apart and higher than us.  God  being good, must punish all sin or wrong doing in the world.  This means that if you sin one time God will cast you in hell for eternity.   Because He is good and He doesn't turn a blind eye to sin.  But there is good news.  2000 years ago Jesus the Son  of God came into this world and lived a perfect life ( He never sinned once)  and He died on the cross taking the wrath that we deserve and paid the penalty for the sins we committed.   The bible says that if you will repent (confess and forsake your sins)  and trust in what Christ did on the cross (He took the wrath of God that was meant for you and I) then all your sins will be forgiven and when you die you will be in heaven with God and all who believe for eternity.  Jesus died and on the third day He rose from the grave.  Get right with God today don't wait.  Once you die after that comes the judgement.  Hebrews 9:27 It's the most important thing you can do.   You must be born again John 3:7 If you repent and trust in what Christ did on the cross it shows that you've been born again or born spiritually.   Right now you're dead in your sins and you can't see the beauty of Jesus Christ but after you trust in Christ all the things you hate about God like obeying him,  serving Him,  loving Him and others,  reading the bible, praying and going to church you will love to do those things because God changes your heart.   That's how you know you have been born again and forgiven.  Please think long about this and ask me any questions you have as this is the most important thing you can ever think of in your life.   An eternity in hell (darkness and a lake of fire the bible describes it, with weeping and gnashing of teeth)  or an eternity out of that place and into the loving arms of God who is infinitely glorious, has infinite knowledge and has infinite power to do all that He pleases.   You decide.   Have a great day!
The Vanny option is still kinda buggy, Freddy has Monty’s claws for some reason
Idk... I think that toward the end while he was being chased by monty he should've tried calling Freddy over and climbed inside Freddy cuz monty woulda left them alone.... so maybe he coulda tried that 🤔
28:42 this is so funny oh my god
😊😊
the way freddy was waiting his turn trying to get past monty was so funny😭
I like seeing everything suffer tho
That editing in the beginning was great,need more edits like that 😆
among all the playthroughs of this game i’ve watched, mark has gotten lost, confused, or stuck the most times by a long shot, its pretty hilarious
Mark yelling "FREDDY" in high pitch is super funny
This is a really interesting twist
Mark screaming Freddy is the funniest shit
i think mark completely missed out on the help wanted lore
17:50 NOOO WTF IS THIS ENDING I HATE IT HERE I’M REALLY GONNA START CRYING
Wheres Inscryption
15:30 NOOO WHY ARE THEY HURTING MY SWEET PRECIOUS FREDDY
23:05
You have miss the good ending You just had to play to the arcade next to  the security thing in vanny base
T h e  U l t i m a t e  B e t r a y l D o e s N o t E x i s t…  Mark: 28:40
28:54 This is the face of a man who knows he is about to die.
freddy: being slow mark: being annoyed everyone's eardrums: ouch
WHY IS MARK LIKE THAT WHEN FREDDY GETS HURT. I HATE IT HERE
28:40  Top ten anime betrayals
28:42-28:45 Bro, this part made me chuckle the hardest. Like, how do you get juked by a giant robotic bear?
Vanessa sounded really really sexual when she said "I think you deserve a reward,go check the main stage."
everyone else's reaction to the first ending: NO FREDDY! Mark: *Confused gamer noises*
Day 64 of asking Markiplier to play Omori
Nice👍🐓
I just realized, in the cutscene leading to the Vanny endings, Freddy clearly has Monty's claws even when you haven't gotten the upgrade.
The running from monty scene is very much my favorite part of this series so far.
Imagine if instead Gregory received help from Chica and not Freddy. We would have mark screaming her dog's name loud while chica is confused outside
Geez stop screaming like a crazy !
The part when he says the game doesn’t feel finished might be because the creator of fnaf retired sometime through out the game so that my have something to do with it
Gregory's parents be like: "Meh, he's fine..."
Here’s what went wrong in development and why some things feel off with this game: Scott left during the production of the game.
Is it just me or did I just cry at Freddy dying omg
Is it really a FNAF Let's Play without Markiplier screaming like a girl?
You missed the good VANNY Ending you must Find all three Princess Quest games Princess Quest 1 Princess Quest 11 Princess Question 111 Arcade Games and play them in order those are mini games you must play to get the Good Vanny Ending you got the Bad Vanny Ending the true Ending is the Vanny ending but you must play all three Princess Quest Machines first you need to find those arcade Machines scattered across the Map so you missed a step play the games hint the last princess quest game is in vanes room where the button is find the other 2 first then do the vanny  ending
do it mark, find me.
I can already see the fan art of Vanny smh
well Markiplier is entertaining but I already watched the full cory playthrough
Lol haha!!! Omg that part when Freddy passed by Mark as he gets chased by Monty🤣
spoiler    having seen other endings....vanny is vanessa possessed and you can save both if you do all 3 princess games. there are like 5 endings.
Mark, this has been the most big-dumb-doofy-doof of a braindead playthrough. You okay champ?
Why you no check the glowing pieces in the room? :(
When mark was screaming for Freddy when Monty was chasing him and then Freddy ran right past him LMAO
vanessa aka vanny is a follower of glitch trap
I think this is the most frustrated Mark has been with a FNAF game. I don't think even the original FNAFs 20-20-20 mode frustrated him this much.
Mark screaming Freddy like a little girl made my night
Freddy: *dies* Mark: *laughs*
“The recharging stations will no longer protect you”  Mark: If I can’t hear you, you don’t exist
Nobody:  Not a soul:  Mark in Security Breach:  "FREEEDDDYYYY!! FREEDDDYYY YOU BITCH!! FREEEDDDDYYYY!! *high pitched squealing scream* FREEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYY
Did you know that you can hit Freddy with your gun? He wont kill you he will just not be inpressed
This game was such a fucking let down. No story, no depth.
You say you will find me??? Bet. I'll be waiting.
The moment Freddy runs rt past Mark I'm in tears!! Mark's high pitch screaming is icing on the cake. Pure comedy gold.  The genuine emotions and visceral frustration make Mark's in-game breakdowns funnier than any scripted comedy. Love it!
28:40 top 10 anime betrayals
This game a mess oml. 😅
THE WAY FREDDY CASUALLY PASSED BY MARK IN THE STAIRS.. IM WHEEZING
....wtf is this game? I'm enjoying the playthrough, don't get me wrong, but this game is terrible. Worst of the FNAF series by far, imo.
What a horrible game. Beautiful world with no story and a let down for depth. So sad.
I like how Mark knows how calling Freddy works, but plays like he doesn’t.
FREDDY HASTHE CLAWS IN THE CUT SCENE THIS IS ALL FOR NOTHING 15:20
If you confess Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart the Father raised Him from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
Here’s a jumpscare list for all of you (There are some jumpscares that don’t actually scare you, if you knew that was coming, but I’ll add them in the list anyway)       3:33 (Moondrop) 7:28 (Moondrop) Mark mentioned who got Gregory at 7:45 10:44 (Moondrop) 12:22 (Moondrop) 27:52 (S.T.A.F.F. Bot) 28:25 (S.T.A.F.F. Bot) 29:13 (Montgomery Gator)
Freddy is so cute Idc
The “you are my super star….” Got me balling my eyes out
"I will find you."  Welp... it's currently Christmas eve at the time I'm Watching this.   Welp I guess if you don't click the links, Santa's not gonna be coming down your chimney, instead, mark breaks into your house I guess
Y tf did Vanessa talk in a sexy tone tho?
"You are my superstar." thanks dad
Goddamit Mark I fell from my chair laughing my ass out when you scream like a bish while Gator chasing you
Fantastic opening
Are we not going to talk about how Gregory just killed vany
Me specifically not clicking on the links: “…..bring it on Mark….bring. It……on.”
you talking about how the game feels incomplete reminds me of the story rule you brought up about the gun. i forget the name of it but basically the tule is if you’re writing a story and you mention a gun on a shelf you must have the gun be shot in that chapter. the stuff with the theatre etc are examples of that rule not being followed since they obviously have been under utilized and perhaps should’ve been left out. i’m no game dev tho so idk how it works but i do think it’s a rule that should be followed, of course there are exceptions for exploration and such when it comes to games
How can moon man attack you while you are inside of Freddy?
I would let Vanny 'Disasssemble' me 😏
still hasn't realized freddy goes to the spot where you hit the button, I see.
I am actually full on crying at screaming Freddy holy Christ the panic
Does anyone know what going to the main stage does before you escape and why at 11:00 we see a mission pop up for Mark called plan A? I have yet to see anything on this or even anyone going to the stage.
Freddy: “you’re my superstar” Mark: “FREDDY YOU BiiTcH!”
I love how in the cutscene Freddy has Monty's claws without Mark going after him.
Gregory had a stroke! so many stars! Too much sugar!
*Not mark unlocking the Ariana Grande high notes when Freddy ignored him and ran right past him*
I've never empathized more with Mark than when he shouted "FREDDY, YOU BITCH!!!" 28:45 I can't believe Freddy finally came to his rescue just to run right past him 🤣🤣 What a perfect moment
Freddy really said "nope" 28:40
“Freddy! Come here! Come help me!” *Freddy runs directly past you*
Excuse me while I cry because at the end of that Freddy said "You...are my....super..star" 😭😭😭😭
28:40 5 Most Brutal Anime Betrayals
28:42 Was the funniest shit i've seen in a while
HAHA FREDDY RUNNING PAST YOU IS MAKING ME LAUGH IN TEARS
how many times have i said shut up to mark being a baby
People really had to pay for this buggy mess 😭
How does Freddy die of that when chica got squished in a pancake maker for garbage
Best part:  28:42
28:33 - 29:22 I already know this would be absolutely hilarious in an animation😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
WHEN FREDDY RUNS PAST MARK ON THE STAIRS I COULDN’T STOP LAUGHING
Marks confused wheezing is the best
No body No body at all Mark: FrEeDY, FReEDy u BASTARD me:🤣🤣🤣🤣
That ending was the greatest
"are you serious? are you serious? are you serious?" me every time he said that: yup. mhm. indeed. yes. yeah
This game's got style, but the pacing is nonexistent and times xD
28:43 🤣🤣😂😂😅🤣
What Mark should do is try and grind to get a level 10 security pass because that makes more endings possible.
Princess Quest is answer for the vanny thing
You better do all the endings mark, they are great.
28:42 I thought Freddy was bouta square up against Monty, homie really told him “good luck bro”
17:29 Remember mark.. Vanny is NOT a robot, she human. So went we saw them disassemble Freddy.. Imagine that, but with a human...
Me: omg this is such a sad goodbye Also me: *wait this is only**14:00** out of **30:40**…*
10:43 my soul after that jumpscare: 🕊️
This game is fucking dogshit...
FREDDYYYY
Should’ve titled this the adventures of moon man and slim
All I heard from markplier was just: ✨FREdDy! FREDDYYY! fREEDDdDdDdy!!!!!! FREDDY YOU BASTARd 😡😡😡😡😡 I couldn’t stop laughing at my life right now 😃
I don't think Mark noticed that Freddy goes to where you ping him... So running and calling him he going to stop at the other places... Poor Freddy xD
28:39 this gave me a laugh
I dunno what is supposed to happen, but seeing this ending takes the game down from 9/10 to a 3...
this game is wildly inconsistent
I cannot fuckin tell you how hard I laughed - I choked on my water - when Freddy BOLTED by Mark when he was calling for him at 28:40  It DESTROYED me. I'm STILL laughing about it a day later. I had to clip it for MY OWN enjoyment.
Try not to over spam the call Freddy hes going to last couple spots you called him at
Mark: FREDDY!?!?!  Freddy: I'm gonna ignore you, like you ignored me when I said to not shoot me in the face
27:52  Don't mind me, just saving my favorite part, lmao
Please find me markiplier, I dare you :3
I'm pretty sure Freddy goes to the location where you summoned him and not your current position.
Someone needs to animate the whole Monty chase montage as Markiplier screams "FREDDAY F R E D E Y Y Y" in a high screaming G10-level note.
When Freddy dies I cried so hard
Baby plush at 22:34 lol
WTF WAS THE END OF THIS GAME?
🙍‍♂️😔
On the "Vanny" option why do they make an awesome looking cutscene and then it's comic time. What is this bo4?
🙍‍♂️🙍‍♂️🙍‍♂️😰😞 WHY DID THAT HAPPEN TO FREDDY OMG IM SO SAD🙍‍♂️🙍‍♂️🙍‍♂️🙁
WHAT THE HELL?
Mark : “I will find you”  Everyone : “Cool, please do that”
"FREDDEYYYYYYYY, FREDDY YOU BASTARDDDDDDDDD"
Mark! That ending would’ve been too gory!
THE FRONT DOORS MARK, THE FRONT DOORS!
Mark: “Freddy i need you” Freddy: “I’m gonna pretend i didn’t hear that”
Amy is probably in the other room like "Oh Mark reached a new octave today" 😂
"They patched that" No, it stated that you couldn't use the charge station at about 6 am.
Somehow he makes a horror game not a horror game just because his screams and yelps are glorious
a day late but like not me crying at the comic lol
That’s the bad ending
Aw Freddy 😭🤣👌🏾
freddy didnt give a fazfuck about saving you from monty 😭😭
Mark screaming about forgetting the save is a mood
"Maybe there was an issue in development" Me remembering Scots retirement announcement.
10:54 if you’d have been looking Mark, Vanessa’s gift was a CD. One of her own Lore CDs actually which is very difficult to find. And she just left one there for you
28:40 moment was absolutely hilarious.
23:38 There a some Classic FNAF Sounds in this, Like that Moniton *aaaaaaaa* From FNAF 2 In the Cutscenes!
FREEEEEEEDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
I’m thinking Gregory is the crying child
Freddy: You are my superstar.... Me, *sobbing* : oh ok
Mark: alright vanesssssaaaaa!! I’m on the main stage!!   Moon drop: ItS pAsT yOuR bEdTiMe  * gets jumpscared *  *Mark from FNAF 3 credits springtrap jumpscare *  Mark: you summmmmbitch
28:44 😂
HHAHAHAHAHAH MARKIPLIER SAID COCK AT THE BEGINNING!
They ran out of budget for the endings lmao
they work really hard to make freddy's ai the worst version possible
You can use Freddy to clip back into the daycare through the glass.
I like how you keep screaming beacause Freddy keeps leaving you🤣🤣
15:30 *NO!*  Freddy Helped in the Game… Vinny made the Cleaning Bots Kill Freddy… Well… Disassemble Freddy, But why… That made me Sad… Glamrock Freddy is My Favorite Animatronic  in FNAF: Security Breach!
Vanny=Vanessa
i love how the editor added in the sounds to those lil robots (the boom sounds and stuff).
The cut scenes are actual trash.
there is a true ending
THE LORRRRREEEEE
28:43  FREDDYYYYYY YOU BITCH FREDYYYYYYYY 😂😂😂😂
This game is a failure
8:17 The Reactions that Markiplier makes is why His Suffering is Funny!
I get that the story has different endings and whatnot but when where the disappearances established?? What
i just watched this man loose his shit, honestly i would of given up at 1am of this game. i am so proud of you mark for managing to get through this whole game, and not throw ur computer out of the window. because i definitely would. merry christmas mark <3333
You can click left mouse button to stun animatronics. That’s why you got chicas voice box
I really thought by upgrading freddy you were setting yourself up for failure with a boss battle. That was surprising.
Mark if you go to Roxy Raceway you can pick up the robo head again and it reactivates the save stations. You can keep going, even if it looks like time has backtracked.
You should play in sound mind 🌸💗🌸 I highly recommend it 🌸💗🌸
Freddy: You must make a choice. Gregory: Vanny? 🤔
God damn this game is a mess
You need Freddy to come find me and right now that doesn't seem to be working so!
Maybe dont press the Freddy button 269 times at once while moving lol
Bad ending Markiplier
How did I know he’d manage the worst possible ending
They have a budget. The ending cutscenes are made to be like that
28:45 best part of the whole video I died laughing
at 13:42 I see venssa under freddy's left arm ( I don't know how to spell her name )
"If I leave, there'll be more disappearances won't there?"  Me who was just as confused as Mark by this point: There were disappearances?
27:50 is when the comedy starts. 🤣
I think this game wasn’t made like Scott Cawthon initially wanted because he underwent a lot of drama on all his social media and being cancelled. He did tweet something at one point that after this game, he wanted a break from everything.
if i click on them, do you still com find me??? you promis?
What happened to momiplier players fnaf
I think what happens with Freddy is that you call him, and he spawns super far away, and as you go away from the original spot you called him from, he still tries to go to that spot, which leads to this really frustrating game of waiting for Freddy to arrive to your location
So fun fact here: Mark doesn't seem to realize Freddy comes to the exact location you call for him and not directly to the kid. Plus there are delays between each summon so Mark was confusing the hell outta Freddy!
0:07 Glamrock Freddy: Good New, It is almost a C*ck! Me: Wait… *WHAT!?*
bro I'm crying
0:05 if this made you laugh, your humor is as dry as mine
Who else saw the people in the back round 13:42
Merry Christmas:)
Okay but seeing Mark scream for Freddy while getting chased by Monty is the most hilarious thing I have seen in months jejshjejbebeb
28:27
The part where Mark was running from Monty on the stairs and screaming for Freddy, and Freddy just runs right part him like nothing had me actually crying. You can't right those kinds of interactions, that was comedy gold.
You started to sound like Joe Biden talking around 25:30 🤣😂
Mark: “Freddy, I need you!” Freddy: Who’s Freddy again???
I legit started crying at 17:49
I was so happy that the new episode came out today because I just finished this episode, 53 minutes ago part 8 came out
" freddy  you bastard!!!" That made me laugh so hard
There's a secret ending with the princess quest in Vanny's hideout in fazer blast.
mark before u regret it take back saying "i refuse it to be the end " ok u dont wanna go through laundry hell again
Freddy: [dies] Game devs: "be sad" Mark: [W H E E Z E]
I did not just spend 15 minutes crying after Vannys ending for a digital robot bear
This really just, straight up doesnt feel like a fnaf game at all...
*Trying to make the game longer to earn more money.
Find the princess games!!
It kinda sucks seeing this game suffer from cyberpunk syndrome.   Absolutely beautiful but buggy as heck.
I like the comic book style but I feel like the endings would actually be more hitting if they just animated them like they did with the animatronics "death" scenes.
Freddy left you to die 🤣🤣🤣
I just love how the game gives Mark the exeact directions and Mark just goes every way but the right one 😂❤️
Mark there's 4 endings one where you can save vany if you play all the princess arcade games
The way he just ran past you 💀💀💀
come find me then that would be cool af
Yo....Kellen and Heather is amazing voice actors. Kellen is Funtime Freddy and Heather was Baby in sister location
Mark screaming freddy was the highlight of my day. Please some make a mark screaming freddy for 10 minutes straight video
I feel bad because Mark had to restart so many times during this game because of no autosave :(
I love how Mark was screeching “FREDDY” and Freddy was just like “haha wonder who that could be”
Mark you gotta play Princess Quest 1,2 and 3 in order to get the best ending! (3 stars)
I’m pretty sure Mark is just mistaken I’m not being able to save, I’m pretty sure he can do it now that the power is back on.
How is this game so bad.
Man, Freddy really did Mark dirty. 🤣
Lmao Mark screaming for Freddy was gold
This is... not five night's at freddys anymore
"FREDDY WHY ARE YOU RUNNING FROM ME" mark says as he calls for him every second giving freddy 20 pings to think about. Like at the end when he got caught, if he had called for him once, and instead of running away in a straight line, and gone in a circle it would have fixed the issue that mark had created for himself
You make me so mad watching you sometime your yelling at freddy because he wont come to you but you wont stop spamming the button which is probably breaking him
I couldn't help it just I screamed for Freddy too Mark. XD
My name is vanessa and hearing him scream my name and being annoyed feels weird xD
I'm more scared of the sound effects edited in for the wet floor signs than the actual jumpscares
God damn this game is broken as hell, such a shame. I took a look at sister location again the other day and this is so disappointing compared to it. I hope they patch it back together but Jesus my dude. Great playthrough though, keeping it real entertaining 🙂
i was crying so hard bc glamrock freddy is my comfort character and he died so horribly. Then minutes later i'm crying again, of laughter this time, bc mark was chased by monty and he got so desperate for freddy lmao😂😂
28:42 this was my favorite part in the vid lol
3:15 THE LORE
merry christler
so.........whens next part gonna come out?
I've never laughed so hard, something about Mark just screaming Freddy like that just tickles me
FREDDY YOU BIT*H laugh so hard like 10min straight omg and the screaming man was screaming for his LIFE
play SUBNAUTICA BELOW ZERO
Freddy goes to the last place he was summoned.
This shows that Mark doesn't really care about the game, he never had interest aside from 2 sections that didn't even last long. It literally told him once in the last video and once in this one that the recharge stations are offline, yet he still tries to use them. Honestly pretty disappointing that he didn't care, the videos kind of suffer because of that.
Is anyone gonna tell Mark theres more than one ending?
I love Mark, but man... This part was so aggravating to watch because there were signs informing him that he could not use the charging stations during that segment. The end part with Monty cracked me up though.
28:43 lmaooo
Freddy goes to where you last pressed Q  so he kept going to the last place you pressed it which is why he ran past you sometimes and the times you called him while running away from Monty he kept coming up behind you but standing where you last pressed Q
Those endings are garbage. The CG is great but its short as hell, and the comic strips look lazy and AWFUL
Moonman...     now thats a name I havent heard since high school XD
Hearing Markiplier shriek "Freddy" is just what I needed today
freddy is bastard 29:18
You get a really big ending that most believe to be the true ending if you play the whole game without dying
Hate YouTube advertisements. There's rtoo much of it on a single video
“FREDDY, YOU BITCH!!!!!!!!!!” I felt this👌🏻
Fun story, but the polish on this game SUCKS. SO many broken bits. Personally, wouldn't pay much for it
21:15 😏😳 wdym by that mark
RIght before moon man gets you on the main stage near 'chicas beak' mission , if yu look in the distance right before he gets you , you can see JUST HIS LEGS DANCING IN THE DISTANCE
28:43 this part had me on the ground in tears
only Mark could get an ending in security breach without even knowing what happened
This is a very polished game..
Freddy wasn't being a jerk on purpose Mark literally called him all over the place and Freddy didn't stop on the stairs to wait his turn mark had literally called him to the spot Freddy stopped at and then had to keep running bc Monty saw him
Me: Did they not have enough money? *five seconds later* Markiplier: Did they run out of budget?   LMAO
13:10 The sudden jump from "escape" to "investigate" is kind of jarring/ It makes sense in term of motivations, but it never really felt like Freddy ever realised that Greg was investigating until that moment And that could work, but then when you're presented with the choice it feels like they knew each others motives from the beginning? It feels like a huge chunk of story was just cut out of my mind At the very least I think there should've been more dialogue between "that is correct" and the choice, because it really makes the pacing messy and hard to take in
I judt love how nobody uses Chica’s screech 👍🏻👍🏻
mark moon man can find you weather or not you're inside freddy, they said that earlier in the game
Am I the only one who still can't figure out if its the game or Mark's sound effects everytime he looks at the caution signs??? T^T
Evil hot bunny. Guess I'm a furry now.
Mark keeps forgetting about the map lol
that ending was shit, just like markiplier said did they run out of money
8:14 Darkiplier good to see you again after all thoses times
I swear, as funny as it is to watch Freddy ZOOM past players while they're begging him to stop, I wish he'd go to the player as they move instead of the location where they called him to.
Lmao FREDDDYYYY!!!! Haahha
Is it me or does this game just feel incomplete or missing parts
Maby There is some stuff going to be  added  in a update
Come find me mate._
Mark: “It’s 5:56” Me, looking up at the time on my phone: Phone: “5:57” Me: 👁👄👁
Someone tell why I cried when that part with broken Freddy came💀
if im being completely honest, this was probably the most disappointing game in the franchise so far. i mean don't get me wrong, i think it was truly amazing.. there was just a lot of missing pieces in here. i think this game could've been so much better with a little more development; there wouldn't be so many lag spots, animatronics teleporting could have been smoother, and overall the storyline could have made more sense. the game was very smooth in the beginning, but i think as the developers kept working they grew tired over it.. hence the lag spots, bugs, and confusing ending. i don't know if anyone agrees with this, i really hope you understand my pov, but yea that's my view.
28:41 my man just ditched it and left him behind lol
I couldn’t stop laughing at 28:41
23:18 lol. It replied. Mark:….Hi… Sign:Ah.
It sucks that you can't track down collectibles until you can't save anymore and then you have to try to collect them all again when Monty kills you. And where is the killing Monty scene? Are you only allowed to get 2 upgrades before the game ends?
This game is so buggy lol
How many bots/basement dwellers will inhabit my reply section?
28:42  FREDDY: oh, hi greg, bye greg!
I about pissed myself when Freddy ran past Mark lmao
Either there was a major sequence break glitch that skipped a lot of exposition, or there was a conscious decision to cut parts of the story in post to rework something. Either way, this game is horrible...Mark trying to defend it feels very similar to the people who are apologists for Cyberpunk. Which...I'm not necessarily comparing the two games, Cyberpunk had a lot more hype for one...But I'm just saying...This game is bad in the same sense as quite a few games that have come out in recent memory.
Game: all charging stations are now deactivated they cannot protect you Mark: why aren’t the charging stations workiiiinnnggg!!!
It's odd how Freddy can stomp around forever without charging, but loses power like crazy when he's slowly walking around with Gregory inside.
Merry Christmas Mark! I wish you all the best, and thank you. I've been watching you for a whiley and I love your videos, and I think your an amazing youtuber! Without you I would probably be squished on the floor while I was jumping of burj khalifa because of boredness. So thanks for all man! Your the best.......
anyone else waiting for part 8
i lost it when freddy zoomed past on the stairs then like a gentleman waited patiently to get back down the stairs
NOOOOO THICC FREDY
Please learn how the mechanics work regarding Freddy, he comes to where you push the button, not to you. Running away from him and spamming the button is never going to help you.
Anyone else not getting notifications when marks posts  even though it's turned on😕
I could have sworn it said that the recharge wouldn't work anymore...
Can't believe Feddy got wall-hack😂
merry christmas Mark 🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄❤️❤️❤️have a good holidays :D
Do u think he will post today since it’s Xmas Eve?
I noticed the beginning is the same as the last episode
Can someone make a tally of how many times he said “what” because he said it more times than I can keep up with.
you will not find me xD
Mark where is part 8 😠
Holy shit I just walked in on my brother watching this and I saw the fredster get pushed and disassembled
IM CHOCKING AT FREDDY U BITCH!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why was Vanessa saying “go to the main stage for a reward” so seductive
when will 8 come out
I wanted to see Freddy thro hands
There are six endings
Waiting on part 8 like: ⏹⏹⏹⏹⏹⏹⏹⏹◻️◻️◻️
the writing of the game is so bad omg.. why did they release it like this? WHAT IS THAT STORY??
where part 8
28:43 FREDDY!!!!
Marry chrysler
Hope you get all the endings plz. I want to see you reation to a certain one
10:30 Vanessa? More like Fanessa
Hey bbg u better upload part 8 rn I’ve been waiting all day Luh u bb
Damn they really released a half-baked game
I'm right here. Come at me!
28:44 Freddy dropping Mark like a bawse.
Scary game funny Mark I liked this video yes!!!!🤮😱👍🎄
IS HE GOING TO POST TODAY??
Plan A huh? that sounds interesting
MARK BEFORE U GET ON TODAY PLEASE GO BACK TO THE LAUNDRY ROOM THERE WAS DOORA DOWN THERE HE WASNT ALLOWED TO GO AND U SHOULD BE ABLE TO NOW THERE IS ALOT OF SECRETS DOWN THERE
That ending of him talking basically kinda turned into a darkiplier moment
28:54 i have never heard mark screeching in such a high pitch. Love it
can u can next song in the works soon???
PLAY ALL PRINCESS QUEST GAMES TO GET ANOTHER ENDING sorry caps lock
Mark, you have to shoot the security bots in the eyes the Fazer Blaster does work.
Scott leaving is the change mark was talking about at 29:00
No you  won't..... your lier
Freddy: "Good news, it is almost a *cluck!"*  Me: Confused for the last 26 minutes of what he said
NEW VIDEO... NOW!
I dare you to shoot Freddy in the eyes lol
Merry christmas everyone!
I know the solution to five nights at Freddy's jump scares ect, fix the circuit breakers and turn on the lights, easy way to complete the game. XD
Fredyyyyyyyyy!!!
I’m back today to re watch the freddy vs monty scene
Monty is evil
the last 3 minutes of this video are probably the most entertaining of the entire 6 hours of gameplay
This was the most stressful series I've watched you play in a long ass time.
Markiplier just seems so clueless playing this game 24/7
I don’t enjoy marks suffering I enjoy seeing his face after completing something that MADE him suffer
My brother was playing recently and he found CDs. I'm not sure what they mean but I would keep an eye out for them if they have secrets to expand to finish theories.
That is a sad end
freddy: *last words before death* you are a superstar... mark: *wheezes at the sad ending*
I think your theory on the development of the game is pretty accurate. Maybe the scope kept getting too big or something.. There's an absurd level of detail but nothing to do with it. It reminds me of Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts, where it started out a Banjo game and ended up more of a driving shooter somehow.
This game needs like 13 more patches to be fully functional.
Stay
FREDDY
I dont hate the comic endings but its certainly jarring
Mark:calls freddy Freddy:nah i dont think i will
When I searched for Mike Hoffman a Hockey player pops out. Who is this Mike Hoffman?
I'm glad Mark's being honest with how he feels about that ending. This game is visually gorgeous but technically buggy and unfinished as all hell. I wish the production company hadn't rushed to push this out for Christmas, 'cause the game has suffered dramatically for it.
10:31
I’m grateful that our FNAF king still put his all into it even though the game itself was a slight letdown
One night at flumpty’s 3
Wow, Freddie dun left Mark out to dry.
There's gotta be more to this game, right?............right?
Is this the end of the series???
Man this game just isn’t very good 😬
I think Security Breach is the most broken and worst game in FNAF history
I think it’s more of he’s going to the exact spot he was summoned to and cannot change spots when summoned again until he makes it to the first one
I feel like Mark never figured out he goes to your location due to standing still when he did it (or atleast I remember him standing still when he summoned Freddy) so he never figured out how it truly worked
It’s like they didn’t test this game before releasing it
So early in this playthrough, he jumped in and out of the recharge station, losing about 1.5 "hours".  Also, I've been watching the endings and didn't realize the Vanny ending just..... jumps you to that last sequence. It's so RUSHED. Hopefully they make dlc/patches to find a better workthrough and fix some bugs.
Why would mark laugh when Freddy dies
Door jumpscare
freddy just casually walking up the stairs while you are being chased by monty
Freddy’s like I don’t see a thing 🏃‍♂️💨
this entire episode is a confusing clusterfuck why does this game suck (I love this game but jesus christ)
Earlyy ig
Wait, so is this the actual end of his series on this?
28:37 is the funniest thing ive ever seen
Freddy running past Mark and Mark screaming after him is the #1 highlight of this entire playthrough. XD
Come on it’s fnaf, there are some secrets and different endings as we all know, you can also find different endings better once you get Monty’s claws with Roxy’s  eyes and Chica’s voice
Mark: I'm done... Literally Everyone else: He aint done
"Freddy? Okay I'll see you on the other side, I guess"  O.o *[redacted] flashbacks*
There are more endings
I hope Mark finds the true ending
Freddy: *shuts down*  YouTube: check out this rise of kingdoms ad
I don’t think they ran out of budget. Vanny is a person, not an animatronic , her being “disassembled” would’ve been pretty graphic in animation
28:00 where’s Freddy when you need him?!🤣
the way freddy juss skip him like he was invisible 😭😭
MARK LOOK FOR PRINCESS QUEST 😭
28:40 duuud that part was The funniest part of this whole series 🤣🤣
Hey mark
I love that markiplier always gets stuck and goes completely crazy
Mark, you missed so many things
Freddy to Monty in the stairs:"After you"
28:42 LMAOOO
Jak zawsze super zajebioza mariusz dobra robota zajebiscie😭😩😩😩😩😩😭😩👍🏻🙈
Hey markiplier did you know that glitchtrap is also in the game I don’t know how to get to him but, there are multiple endings like if you play every princess quest 1-3, 3 being in vannys room
Thank you, Mark, you made me laugh while crying at the superstar parts :') <3 I appreciate you so much
This game is a huge step-down from what FNAF used to be 0-0
In order to get the true ending you have to press stay and get Montys claws so Freddy is able to break down gates that only Monty could do, if you go through the gates eventually it Leeds you to a secret elevator and once you get in the elevator it takes you to see the final ending, also the elevator is a checkpoint so if you die you will respond inside the elevator so it’s really easy to get back to where you were
PLS CONTINUE THIS SERIES ☀️🍄
you were supposed to do monty before roxy, in order on the upgrade computer i think
That bad ending gave me Iron Giant level feels.
Mark put on your lucky flannel !
Part 8 Christmas Special please?
28:45- 28:47 had me on the floor 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Cuz why did Freddie take off and leave him like that?
Me the big brained individual (deeeefffinetly): bots, re assemble freddy
WE NEED THE OTHER ENDINGS
Merry Christmas Markiplier  I hope u have a good one 👍
Hey Markiplier, I just wanted to say that you can shoot the S.T.A.F.F. Bots in the eyes. You were always missing them by an inch
he blames freddy but marks just mad thats he's not a very fazbear
11:08 I'm confuse why mark can't just go to a recharge station so moon/ daycare robot doesn't get him, nvm I know why he doesn't cause he can't
Freddy the Betrayer
4:06
This game has so many glitches and confusing parts and it makes me sad since I can see its potential, it's obvious that it was rushed so I hope they fix things soon
Does Mark put a 24-hour countdown to upload the next part every time? His punctuality is both impressive and infuriating
Still wondering what that whole thing about something under the place drawing lots of power from the building. I know it wont be the case, but it would be awesome if it was built on top of sister location, or something crazy like that
The canon ending is insane so I hope you find it.
Markiplier is like Sherlock Holmes
There is anotger vanny ending by using the machine instead of using the button but you must finish the levels 1 and 2 to us the lecel 3 game machine princess blablabla Also vanny is not a robot
i remember watching markymoo playing fnaf in 2014…         good times
"This is where i must stay. Do not return. It will never be safe. I will miss you." Man i wanna cry
Mark: FREEDDYYYY Freddy: *CLOMP CLOMP CLOMP CLOMP*
You’re my superstar, forever :D
i fkn love markiplier but the way he never listens to the game and forgets what he’s doing each part has been pissing me off😩😂
the first time a video game has made me cry. Then he started hinting to their RECYCLED PIZZA. then made me cry at the real ending
Mark is our Superstar I hope he can find the true ending
Excuse me, where is part 8? 😔
Man I really thought they left the story boarding in there when the Vanny ending played
Vanney is definitely a real person in a suit.
mark press the button on the main stage bruh
Vanny tho she kinda...😏
so here we all are waiting as the next episode might come out or it might not who knows!
there are six endings pls do them all if possible
28:42 "get me in get me in- FREDDY YOU BITCH FREDDYYYYY"
WHERE IS PART 8
it does kinda feel like there are some rough edges... there was probably so much content for the creators to work on and several different creative views that some things are a bit choppy. Like when you're writing a large paragraph and delete and add some chunks but don't proof read so you end up with sentences like "when if you go to the store and when end up with two apples"
Are you serious counter 242
Jesus, Freddy just booking it up the stairs past Mark who has been screaming looking for him just about killed me. Honestly the hardest I've laughed at a play through in a very time.
i feel like if u upgraded freddy to max and u went to vanny maybe freddy survives idk (not sure if u upgraded him 100%)
there are multiple endings
E
Mark: FREEDDDYYYYY YOU B@TCHHH  Freddy: "pass by him"
Just by the way mark, in part 6 the fazwatch said the recharge stations are offline.
Maybe getting the Faz Camera would help stop Monty since he's got the glasses?
i love how mark completely ignores the “recharge stations don’t work right now” EVERY SINGLE TIME
Its gonna be a weekend isn't it...
Part 8? 100% pls?🥺🙏🏼 The king of FNAF?🙏🏼🥺
When is the next episode
Saved the “FREDDEEEEEY” situation on my gallery Hahahaha . This made my Christmas extra extra memorable ☺️
XD
I love his high pitched "FREDDY YOU B*TCH" as he just runs right past him at 28:43😅😂
POST MORE INSCRYPTION
7:30 "What happened?" 7:39 speed up  28:41 "FREDDY! FREDDY YOU B****!"
Well.. that budget vanny ending was, quite, interesting
Think Mark is onto something, there is so many areas that haven't been explored yet--I'm wondering if they're going to make DLC packages to add on to make the game more explorable in the future..
Please release an unedited version of this, I really want to watch you die repeatedly to moon man
Still sad that you didn’t stay for the Easter egg about Freddy talking about Bonnie😥
watch this at 4am those jumpscares..
17:58 Mark.ex has stopped working
Mark screeching for Freddy had me almost in tears 😂
Mark played the bit that told him he could use the recharging stations like 10 times and still got mad when he couldn’t use the charging stations 😂🙈
why does vanessa say "go check the main stage" so SEDUCTIVELY
Shoot the STAFF bot onstage with the Fazerblaster. It's a secret achievement
this ones not as good imo
2019: "I love you 3000" 2021: "You are my Superstar"
Mark, Freddy has always gone to where you last push the button. I noticed that when you played the game.
he can go to the save from 5:50 before he got the new eyes and get montys upgrade and do the after 6 part with all the upgrades.
Mark calling Freddy and Freddy running past him has the same vibe as the LET ME IN meme
I love the sound effects for the caution bots
man i remeber when you have 9 mil subs and would play yandere simulator it makes me seeing  how you have grown
Still getting jumpscared by the sentient wet floor signs, I see
There’s multiple endings, that’s only one of them it isn’t the true one
I'm not even going to sugar coat it, this game has a lot of issues.
it's been a long time since I watch you doing a let's play the last time was like 2 years ago the series was about until dawn anyway I am excited for part 8
There's multiple endings to this game
Mark hitting a whole new octave with "FREDDEEEYYYYYY" gives me life
How could you play through the game and NOT realise how the 'call freddy' function works? Seriously Mark pay attention to the damn game instead of screaming at it... He goes to the first place you call him, so call him ONCE instead of calling him dozens of times while running away
So part 8?
PLEADE POST THE NEXT ONE ITS BEEN 22 HRS
THEY ENDED IT WITH A GRAPHIC NOVEL INSTEAD OF A CUTSCENE WTF IS THIS
Hey Mark! There's a very important ending that you need to get to understand what happens!!!
"Because I know that you, for some reason, enjoy my suffering."  Yes, I do, Mark. I _reaally_ do. :)
Freddy was literally like oh hey Monty how are you while Gregory was screeching and sobbing and ripping his hair out
23:56 I want the sun plush in real life
everyone with daddy issues felt Freddy's death
the last part with Freddy, Mark, and Monty was the funniest part of the series so far
Freddy: "It's time for you to leave."  Gregory: "Vanny"
This video was good
The end of this game seems super broken.
28:30 so funny OMG especially the staircase part when freddy just goes past
Just a tip, you can use the fazerblast on the staff and cleaning bots but they have to be turned towards you for it to work.   You need to play all three princess quest games in order to get the true ending and then choose Vanny.   There’s an exploit that allows you to save the game after 6am, unless they already patched it up.  You pick up the broken drivers assist head. That’s all you have to do.   There are seven endings and to get the coolest one, the so called “there’s something else going on here” ending, you need Monty’s claws.   Hope this helps! :)
Marks confusion is priceless
Love you mark but jesus this is the most frustrating gameplay video
Holy shit, freddy running right past him when he's running from monty killed me
Mark really needs to pay attention more lmao
Instead of going to the exit, go back to the raceway in the last 10 minutes before 6am and find the underground thing
Play it again but pick stay so u could fine the secrets ok ☺️
💁 game sucks?
I’ve seen so many let’s players complain about Freddy’s AI but no one seems to recognize how his AI works. When you call Freddy he doesn’t follow you despite what everyone thinks. He goes to where he was called. So you have to call Freddy and wait for him or else he will be at the position you once where at.
All of those places are for different missions
Lixian if youre watching this, make a animation of this plz.
So will you be playing more of this Mark?
So we are all refreshing the page or what
I think that the reason that there is a bunch of missing content is because they may update it sometime in the future because it took them  like 2 months longer than was expected to make it
The main problem with summoning Freddy is that he goes to the last place you called him to. So if you’re running and you summon him, and you continue running, he’ll just blow past you and go to the exact point you summoned him. They need to fix it so if you summon him, he won’t stop chasing you until you climb inside him instead of going to the last point you called him.
Mark desprately shouting for Freddy as Freddy charges past Mark on the stairs had me in tears
It probably was too hard to make Freddy stop the moment he comes close to you or check more often where you actually are while pressing the summon button. :D
Marks line of thinking about Vanny being a red HAREing, because of the red eyes and being a bunny sounds really funny, but for some reason also sounds like something Scott would think of LMAO
yes i'm ham
This reads like a project that ran out of time.
It seriously feels like the devs saw something like poppy playtime and decided to change a lot about this game to fit something closer to that. Idk it just seems like they had a lot of solid ideas and then for whatever reason scrapped/modified them to try and be more universally appealing, which led to the trainwreck we currently see.
This was meant to come out in 2020…..
for the true ending you need all three prinses quest games completed
Cringe attention comments
Around 29:00 “FREDDYYYYYY YOU BITCH”
You should play this new indie game called the ”The Captain” by Sysiac games. Its like a Adventure game in space
i can't be the only one who thinks security breach feels rushed asf..?
So many scary games, I want something new
We need a compilation of Mark screaming for Freddy. 😂
Freddy completely missing Mark and him dying by Monty is so funny someone should animate that
Honestly I’m not sure if that was the last episode but if it was then all I can say is this was kind of short lived series
Did you know morty killed Bonnie
go on man go on
Just hearing Freddy's footsteps clomping while approaching mark is really funny. *Clomp**Clomp**Clomp**Clomp**Clomp**Clomp*
I think the fact is that even though this game's environment is incredible, this game is certified hot garbage
im crying
Freddy:dies Mark:laughs My brain: w-why
What a garbage ending lmao
I'm crying when he said you are my superstar
FREDAY!!!!!!!!!!
dying at mark screaming for freddy lmao like in tears gasping for air.
the outro is funny
Mark has gone from screaming Freddy's name in terror, to screaming his name for help
omg XD the end freddy?! XDD how he really waited his turn to go down the stairs XD
I’m pretty sure that the game isn’t linear at all, Game Theory Live fought Monty before the other two animatronics and they’ve accessed other areas as well, so I’m pretty sure that it’s meant to be more free roaming and that fnaf players aren’t used to seeing that in the series.
28:40 this made my year :DD
hey mark, i wanna say thank you so much for creating videos because they help me to get through tough times and right now this year especially hasn't been going well for me but i still watch your videos because they make me happy.  Thank you.
It's funny, because I don't think they ran out of budget, they probably made a comic, because of vanny's disassemble, maybe would be gory
29:13 is a comedy gold 😂😂😂
Remember when you found the little construction site at Roxy Raceway? Well you have to go to that place when you've fully upgraded Freddy and when you go there and you finish what you have to do you get the "True Ending"
This game is extremely rushed and unoptimized, and i’m glad Mark is expressing his opinion. I feel the same way
Marry Christmas Msrkiplier 🎄
43 yo trauma surgeon here and I have been watching you with my kids for years. Just saw your commercial for mental health. Just want to say thanks and that you are a good dude man.
28:43 brahh that was funny as hell 🤣
Just wanted to say have a merry Christmas mark (if you do celebrate it) and to the people who read this (and also celebrate this) and if not I hope your holiday is joyful:)
Do more of security breach. Don’t let it end HERE! At least try for a HAPPY ending!
FREDDYYYYY FREDDYYYYY
Okay the way Vanessa says "Go check the main stage" though... She can get it
mans first ending was the worst one. rip. play mini game in vanny hideout
EVERYTIME YOU PUSH THE CALL FREDDY BUTTON WILL SUMMON HIM TO THE FIRST LOCATION PRESSED.
I truly hope we get more of this while Mark tries to solve for the true ending
There are actually 5 endings. Leave: bad ending  Vanny: ending u saw Stay: another vanny ending but different  Secret ending: leaving through the vip exit True ending: William ( co owned first dinner that got insane and murders allot of people dying in a fire by his son returning with molten Freddy )
Make sure to summon Freddy in the Bonnie Bowl for a voiceline!!!
Completely off topic but they made a new one night at flumpty
Now we're just waiting on the theorists to stitch together a theory using the letters.
I wasn’t looking when mark started saying “what happened” and I thought my phone was broken😂
I feel like moon being able to find and kill you when you’re in Freddy is a mechanic that does kinda make sense, which is what makes me think it’s intentional. The fact that you are just suddenly outside of Freddy and you can only hear the jumps are (and see it if you look at Freddy, I’m pretty sure) makes it seem like a bug tho. It would be cool if they made it an intentional part of the game as that means Freddy isn’t 100% a safe space. They could just add a cutscene where moon maybe opens Freddy chest and then it would make more sense.
Do a part 8! Please your so funny to watch and your awesome! Unlock the secret ending..Like this message y’all if you want him to do a part 8
i can't believe i cried for an animatronic 😭😭
Freddy: "I am coming to where you first pressed the button!"  Mark: *Spamming the Call Freddy button* "F R E D D Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y ! ! ! !"
Is Mark really that stupid? He would attempt to continue the game finding all the collectibles and finishing the Monty quest without the ability to save, when I'm guessing he could have done all that before he reached the optional leave/stay ending point.
Freddy you are my superstar   Mark: starts laughing
OH MY FOS GAHA i started watching this yesterday and the last episode came out lol
I have one dream in my life. And it is to meet you and jack. I've been watching you both since i was like 8 years old. (I'm 16 now) you have been huge idols for me. Keep up the good work!! Love your content!
There is multiple endings
Well that's one slow descent into madness
Bucket of cream?
Mark, when are you getting more merch in?
cool
Hi man Please like cament because I like video  You is best youtuber
Whoever the editor is, the first 10 seconds were top tier, thanks for the laugh!
Why isn't he going to a recharge station to stop the daycare worker
You can find the secret balloon boy minigame by using the [item redacted] that you couldve earned other than the gun
the ending was genuinely so anticlimactic💀💀 the comic style came out of no where wtaf
7:45..... Morgan Freeman much?
Mark is a smart man, so how has he not figured out he's calling Freddy wrong?  Freddy doesn't come to you, he comes to the location you were standing at when you called him.   All of the running around and spamming call is making it not work properly because he keeps re-pathing Freddy around the map to the fastest possible path/door for the most recent call
24:56 no mark you are just blind, you missed so many gift boxes and bags throughout this playthrough and they were at times LITERALLY in your face
game: charging stations are deactivated Mark: lets try a recharging station
Mark: “Freddy i need you” Freddy: “I’m gonna pretend i didn’t hear that”
We need more inscryption
The most random start of video I've ever seen 😳
"Good news! It is almost a cOCK" -Glamrock Freddy, 2021
Future video ideas: going bald challenge, clean shaven challenge, new earring challenge, new tattoo maybe, wearing tanktop in public challenge, wearing pink in public challenge, wearing a suit in public for 24 hours challenge, wearing ethnic clothes in public challenge, walking barefoot in public challenge, avoiding using car for 24 hours challenge, avoiding using cell phone, or internet, etc for 24 hours challenge, brian can also do these for his videos, what else avoiding electricity for 24 hours challenge, taking the bus or train only for 24 hours challenge, walking to destinations only for 24 hours challenge meaning no using personal transport, no listening to songs for 24 hours challenge, you can combine 2 challenges or more, not talking for 24 hours challenge,  fasting for 24 hours challenge, no sodas for a week challenge, no fast food for a month challenge, what else no TV for an hour challenge, no mentioning basketball for a year challenge, like this comment so Brandon sees it.
Its a good thing i got everything before the patch because speeding through the game without hiding isnt easy- Cause Freddy now "lies about being your superstar by passing and sometimes even runs away when needed" (i want my teleporting fred back)
Vanessa: Gregory! I think you deserve a reward, go check the main stage  Me: holy sh!t that sounds SO VERY MUCH out of context
Yeah, there were different paths that you could have taken because 1 Monty would be destroyed and you'd take his claws, and there's a camera that has kinda the same effect of the gun, this isn't a spoiler its just telling how much work was put into this game and how many different options there were to take down the journey of Gregory's stay. Also wish there was an interaction with the music man that would make him not hostile or something along that path, something that includes more than 1 person non hostile but eh it's their story lol
A Little "Save Cheat". Go back to carting driver head and take it again. The time will be set to 5.15 and never change anymore. Save stations will work AND you CAN complete any of the endings.
It really feels like they didn't plan to let you go to Fazer Blast first originally, the games Vanny endings only unlock if you go to Fazerblast and find her secret vent room and it feels super anticlimatic to go into the Vanny ending after finding it so long ago compared to if you did it the other way around, it's also way easier to get Chicas beak and escape her than it is to do Monty's quest without checkpoints, the game feels super unbalanced with how little you have to do with Chica and how much you have to do for Monty
Freddy runs to the exact location you press the call button, spamming it triggers issues because it has to "recalculate" the fastest route from his current location to the new location the button was pressed.
PLAY PRINCESS QUEST 1 AND THEN 2 THEN 3
Mark play princess quest for one of the endings, you also should play the bb balloon game
... dat intro ... yes Freddy that is great news
I need to see an animation of Mark being chased by Monty and screaming for Freddy.
Mark don't forget to go check out the thing that is drawing the power down bellow that place where you heard about that being a thing. It's important.
Game: if u die while staying it's game over me: (thinks it game over) game: BACK TO THE OPTIONS
This was an awesome serie. 😍😍💓👍 I would love to see more stuff like this. Maybe look for fan made fnaf games😁
Merry Christmas everyone!
happy chrismas markiplier and everone :D
i looked at your cloak stuff but you only sell to small people, why is that?
Mark's comments about the game being changed radically at some point do make a lot of sense. During the first episode I was thinking that the game was a lot like Alien: Isolation, especially with that popup about the noise maker, but then the gameplay changed up a lot. Also, check out that credit list. All those people working on the game, all those sumptuous and detailed visuals, and you've got stuff like disappearing Party Pass bots and blatantly teleporting animatronics?
There are 7 endings
Happy holidays mark!
23:19 is that golden Freddy ?
There’s a bad ending and true ending and a secret ending and a good ending lol
Darkiplier!!!!!!!
Basically there's Multiple endings and playing all princess quest games in order from 1 2 3 unlocks an ending (7 endings in total)
We need more videos where mark just talks to lixian
27:20 For your entertainment and amusement, Enjoy!
Wait… if Roxy could look through walls, how were you able to hide from her in uncovered bins?
Freddy’s just respectful
The high pitched screaming of mark when he can't get Freddy to save him, got me on the floor dying laughing!
28:39 need to save this legendary moment 💀💀💀
It's so interesting to see Markiplier play this game without him knowing the whole story with Vanny since he missed a LOT of lore from FNAF VR and FNAF AR.
28:40 LMAO!!
I love mark!!!
There’s a pizzeria where foxys old stage is at go there
25:04 maybe depending on the area you go in changes the way the game plays a little bit? but whatever route you take it still ends the same? idk this just made me think
that first ending was seriously abrupt. How'd you trigger the end game without finishing half the plot? Like.. you find out nothing about vanny or what she's doing so why would you care? you haven't had any information about missing kids here. It feels like a huge chunk is missing. What on earth?
this was honestly a great way to end my b-day thanks mark
Come find me with the red haring of yours!
Freddy is the funniest
I hope they patch that "no saving" on Stay because depending on how thorough you are there can be around three hours of gameplay left, and the idea of repeating that is just obnoxious.
how will u find me in czech republic markiplier lol 🤣🤣🤣
There’s like 5 endings mark one of ‘em even got an ultimate boss
I think you have to complete all the princess quests and have all the upgrades that how you get the true ending
There are many endings...Leaving through the dock, staying, leaving, Vanny, a big boss battle thing, lots of stuff
was waiting on this
carti doing his adlib : 15:43
Freddy: Chillin  Markiplier: FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
“The recharging stations will no longer protect you”  Mark: *If I can’t hear you, you don’t exist* 🖤🖤🖤
This game is so shit
That last animation was so perfect that the whole company is worked on that.
18+ DLC ☺☺☺
Scott left the franchise that's what I'm assuming has made the game feel incomplete
COVID 19 IS ALL KNOWN AND ALL PLANNED FOR ECONOMIC RESET. IT WILL START OUT PROMISING ,BUT THIS IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS IS THE BEAST SYSTEM..NEVER  TAKE THE COVID 19 BAND AID VACCINE..........................EVER............................... THE DAY WILL COME THAT YOU CAN'T BUY OR SELL WITHOUT THE MARK.. YOU CAN'T BUY OR SELL WITHOUT IT. IF YOU TAKE YOU WITH REGRET IT WHEN GODS JUDGEMENT IS POURED OUT. YOU WILL BE THROWN DIRECTLY INTO THE LAKE OF FIRE FOR ALL ETERNITY. GOD LOVES YOU, GOD WILL MEET YOUR NEEDS, AND THE ONLY WAY TO GOD IS JESUS CHRIST. ANSWER. JESUS CHRIST.,
I think you can save if you choose "Stay". Just "Vanny" locks the save spots.
Are you serious ?😞
Part 8!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! please
Please don't tell me this is the last episode
I’m pretty sure Freddy comes to where you pressed the summon Freddy button
No they killed Freddy ? :(
I don't think Mark understands how calling Freddy works
Hey mark, wasn't there a Christmas episode on distractable there and seems to have disapired much like Freddy
"If you don't click those links, I will find you" yay! I get to meet mark!
28:40
Everyone: is sad that Freddy dies  Mark: *tea kettle noises*
"What they did. Was. Make...Freddy cccome to you from farther away and not teleport so much.  _ʙᴜᴛ ɪɴ ᴅᴏɪɴɢ sᴏ sᴇᴇᴍs ʟɪᴋᴇ ᴛʜᴇʏ ʙʀOKE HIM  E N T I R E L Y"_  Had me rolling on the floor absolutely WHEEZING
Mark, for the love of god, stop spamming the Freddy button 🤣
On one of the night guards table's there is a bottle of lotion and a picture of Roxy it's on one of them
Mark. Put the game down, get some sleep... You're going so insane you're missing obvious clues and hints, and to be honest this kinda isn't funny anymore.
Mark: I will find you…  Me:Please do. Im tired of this hell hole of a household. Bish I got 7 damn siblings. Find me. Do it. Now.
WHAT ABOUT MONTY AND THE HAND UPGRADE?!
mark there is a secret ending try to get it
Buggy game... So stupid...
15:06 what a horribly jarring transition.
28:41 top 10 anime betrayals
there are like 5 diff endings but I hope mark gets the one with springtrap
Love watching others play these games especially Mark! Love how Mark finds humor even in the scariest moments  Markiplier screeching in panic for Freddie was definitely unexpected
Bro they just ripped apart Vanny. Oh my god.
@markplier are you going to anime frontier in Austin?
"FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!"😂😂
Oh well I have not been listning to Distractible yet but you are more than welcome to come find me in Denmark Mark! XD
gregory: *vanny*  freddy: what? what do you mean? gregory: *did i stutter*  a few minutes later:  vanny: dismantle freddy 🤩  another few minutes later:  gregory: how the turns table.  gregory: dismantle *vanny* >:]
after 7 episodes the sound of freddy running/walking STILL SCARES ME
lol
PART 8 PWEASE
17:11 Wow, that was shit.
i grew up watching mark's fnaf videos and at the end i just sobbed. i miss my childhood so much
Monty, stalking Mark Mark: F R E D D Y Freddy, leaves Mark high and dry to then get jumped by Monty Mark: FREDDY YOU B**** Us, laughing our asses off
The end though😂😂😭
freddy gets tired of gregorys shit so he runs
28:43 the voice of screaming  😂😂
If they made a Gravity Falls movie, I hope they would hire Markiplier to play Stanford. I don’t know why but in my head I can easily imagine him saying, “WHO ARE YOU? HAVE YOU COME TO STEAL MY EYES!?!”
What the fuck are these endings? Am I having a stroke? What the FUCK SteelWolf?
I don't know when mark is going to realize that he only needs to press the Freddy Button once, and every second time he does it hes sending him back to his room so he doesn't stop.............
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation?" is more or less what was on my mind. I don't think Mark meant to deliver that burn but god it was funny.
Mark find all the princesses quests arcade machines for the best and most wholesome endings (must play them in order)
Markiplier is over here screaming on the top of his lungs for Freddy to get over to him as Monty‘s chasing
There are a few endings from what I heard
I’m currently cuddling my pet rabbit in my bed, fur is everywhere
Freddy on the first part of the video:"Good news it is almost a cluck"  Me:did he just say cœck?? 😀
"Good news! It is almost a 🐓" That just broke me.
If Mark's skills for finding people are as good as Freddy is at finding Gregory.... well, I'm not that worried about finding me if I don't click the links.
this game is such a mess, id be genuinely ashamed of releasing anything this unfinished.
Behind a foxy pirate poster in the daycare is a door leading to suns room the room where he jumps down from to the ball pit at 26:12 the poster is infront of him at the end of the hallway in the daycare theator
Hey one of the episodes of distractible was about me
Oh no please don't hurt my feelings lol 😅
You can save after 6 AM, at least currently. If you go into Roxy's Raceway and pick up the robot head, which will give you a second one, it will set you back to 5:15, but it will still act like it's six.  The e-mails make things make more sense. The game is confusing. You can see some of the assets were bought on the UE4 marketplace, which might be why the mall feels disjointed.   There are many places you didn't explore/missed, including upgrades, etc. Best of luck finding them!
Mark: It's bugged The game: This is literally how you play....W-What!?!?!
What is up with scary sound effects and those sign looking robots?
28:41 Freddy: *Seeya later alligator~*
Bruh he didn’t get to the Monty claw scene
do the secret ending?
29:15 "OMG FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY YOU'R BASTAAAAAAAAARD!!!!!"
FREDDDDDDDY come yes wait FREDDY COME BACKKKK
17:57 You're laughing. Freddy is dead, you are his superstar, and you're laughing.
bob the buiolder  is hot
The betrayal in your voice was crushing
whens inscryption part 6 coming
M. . .Mark. Spamming the call freddy button breaks it. Stop spamming it. Press once. Be patient.
Good work as always Mark take a break I wait for more ❤️
I’m convinced this game is held together with a couple pieces of duct tape and glue with how glitchy it’s been lol
What the fuck is that ending, that shit made me laugh more than the AoT ending and that one was horrible.  Seriously, there's gotta be some problem within development that lead to this weirdly under-developed game.
I love the fact that Mark practically binged playing the game while forgetting to do other series like Inscription. Then again, it's been a hot minute since Mark played FNAF.
FREdDYYYYYYYYYY🤣🤣🤣🤣
I need to see an animated where freddy runs right past mark and then you see music man running after freddy
I gotta say it was pretty clear Mark wasn't fond of this game, probably because of all of the bugs but also just being tired of the series.
Hearing Mark yell "FREDDY!!!!!!!!!" had me on the floor 😂💀
how did mark forget the stun upgrade lmao
markiplier: *screams* FREEEDDDDY voice: not now mate we’re gonna let you sound like a girl markiplier: *continues to scream with a girly voice* freddy: *runs to markiplier but doesn’t stop running and runs past him*
the outro with the STAFF bots shredding freddy to bits with the music made me laugh my ass off
Even with upgrades, Freddy can't locate you
I have a question for you. I've been watching all your fnaf playthroughs, and I noticed that you never actually attempted 50/20 mode in Ultimate Custom Night. Are you ever going to go back to try and beat it?
My heart feel so warm when Freddy call us "superstar"
Vannesa DEZZ NUTS OOOOOHHHH
Whatever you do never shoot the little yellow bots 🤦🏻‍♂️
This game is an unfinished mess
Mark: *sees freddy gets pushed off of the bridge* also mark: "What happened??"
This is the only thing getting me to Christmas 🥲 Merry Christmas Mark!
please do all the endings!!
mark i hope you realize that freddy goes to the spot where you called him. he doesn't follow you until he is next to you
Ugh, I hate this, FNAF always does this shit where it takes over the whole channel, when's Inscryption continue? You're playing more then just FNAF, you know... This game is always the same boring game again, I know the majority of people loves repetition (Proven by the comments...) But come on, this is overkill.
28:37 top 10 anime betrayals lol
OK was I the only one who was like no no no and then really sad when Freddy died and called Gregory his Superstar 😭😭😭  Also, Mark frantically screaming for Freddy was amazing 🤣
Mark: “FREDDYYYY!!!!” Freddy: *runs past him and Monty* Mark: “FREDDY YOU COWARD!!!”
Vanny my answer is vanny   Freddy:precedes to take him to the mental hospital
There is a secret ending if you stay and get montys arm/claws then down at the creepy tunnels... like the minds I think...  something really creepy down there forgot where it was but think it's in the minds some where
28:40 I laughed so hard
Wait the entire lead up lead to that…?
Not sure how many people have said this. But there is a way to save after staying. It’s a really helpful bug. If you go to Roxy’s Raceway and collect the maintenance robot’s head like you did before, you will enable saves. Don’t worry this doesn’t affect any save data or anything, it just lets you save your progress at stations again, for some reason.
28:40 seeing Freddy whizz by really cracked me up
Died in the first 10 seconds lmao
YOU CAN FAZZERBLAST MONTY, READ THE COMMENTS!!!
There is an arcade mashine in the Vanny's room. Play it.
Fun fact: If you shoot the S.T.A.F.F bot on stage in the theatre with the fazblaster it starts its comedy routine
Merry Christmas mark!😁
TWO SECONDS?
It’s Freddy Uchiha
also this game is way to glitchy idk how they get away with it
Who would like multiplayer survival horror(Death by Daylight) type of game. Based on Five Night at Freddy. Like the graphics of Security Breach look more than enough for a game of that genre.  And it would be cool if it was 4 animatronics vs 8 survivors. Just to be a little bit different from the formula.
im not sure mark realizes just how deep this sinkhole goes...
This sequence tho 28:39 Gregory: FREDDY HELP MONTY IS TRYING TO KILL ME! Freddy: Hol up I left my phone be right back
I think he forgot that there was the log that said that there was a large power drain under the facility.
so the ending you got was the "freddy death" thats what i call it because what vanny did was she made the "help bots" goafter him and there is a true ending.
Mark, upset and fuming: I WILL FIND YOU Me, chilling in bed: Okaaay. Merry Christmas, don't come down the chimney 😊
Hm go to thewafflegalaxy and vote for valheim
He goes to where you were standing. You kept delaying him
Freddy running past mark as he desperately needs him was amazing 😂
The games feels very unfinished with many aspects being incomplete and things like completely destroying the other robots in order to upgrade Freddy just felt pointless and after 6am he’d probably be arrested or some shit for that
this game is really wicked
@Markiplier obviously you know there are multiple endings but for the sake of you not have to deal with Monty very often go to gator golf and decommission him, fair warning there is a common misconception that he is dead after that, however, due to his injuries he is now just the slowest animatronic in the game and is very rare to see.
If anyone is curious to glitch thru the map spam jump while entering freddy
28:43 The funniest part of this whole series. I legitimately almost laughed out loud at work.
He’s going to play the stay option, right?
Can u please continue inscryption 🤲🏻
Okay artist
28:40 definitely the funniest thing in the video 😂
Go ahead Mark, find me! Bet you won't!!!!! HA
I really want to see the ending where Freddy needs to be fully upgraded and then going in the old elevator
What happened what happened what happened what happened
Mark, you've got an odd attention span and memory.
while i loved watching the gameplay and the glitches are hilarious i think the devs should’ve held off for at least 6 months to fix the story and play quality. they could’ve had done more with vanny so people would feel less like she was advertised falsely (ik theres a chase scene but thats really not much). this was a huge project for a pretty small team, and i feel bad for how much negativity they got but i hope they just patch up the game and continue to make games. they have a lot of potential.
The theatre section is used when you go the Monty path instead of chica! Also, the Freddy running around is hilarious!
Only 30min?????? D:
Mark you need to do the princess games there’s a special ending if you do it you need to do it you have to pretty please
28:45  Mark: "Oh Freddy thank god, let me get inside before Monty catches-"  Freddy: "I am speed"
i think that when vanessa says to check the main stage the clump of animatronics should be there
Freddy:*Dies* Markiplier:*intensive Laughing*
Mark: I will find you Me: Oh no, how unfortunate... (wink)
🔴HELP ME TO REACH 1000 please 🌹
I love mark, but oh my gosh he has struggled with the simplest things in this game 😅😅😅
Merry Christmas mark
Hiiiiiiiiiii
There different endings
14:28 honestly mark does kinda sound like freddy lmao
This game is awsome
Gotta play the princess games (in order) for other ending
Mark! If you don’t upload the next episode of security breach in the next 5 minutes, I will drink milk and send audio of the reason why I can’t have dairy!
I think theres 2 reasons some endings are animated and why some others are comic strips. - Its not only due to budget, but due to Space (the game is 70gb, and part of that is due to alot of poor optimization). - The 2 animated scenes (that i know off) are both pretty disturbing and kinda graphic.
There is a way to save you just need the head from Roxy raceway and leave it in your inventory. It’s a glitch
If you max out freddy with the upgrades then go to the Roxy raceway elevator you'll get the true ending
they could do a mass effect andromeda five nights at freddy game
Ya Mark is giving this Game def not a 10/10
Let's all take a moment to see what mark said during the time he was being chased by Monty: "FREDDYYY" "FREEEEEDYYY" "Freddy please" "FREDDY YOU BITCH" "F-FREDDY DON'T WAIT YOUR TURN GOD DAMNIT" "OMG FREDDYYY" "FREDDY YOU BASTARD"
25:09 did freddy just crush a S.T.A.F.F. Bot?
That was literally the definition of anti-climatic
Skill issue
play princess quest in order from one to three you will get an ending
Freddy ignoring Mark was HILARIOUS the button leads Freddy to where you press it, and i think spamming it just confuses him on where to go hahaha Ik the bugs are a lot, but usually open world games are extremely buggy, and they usually get resolved in the bug fix updates. Its a huge game too. They probably had to take some endings or other content out last minute to make it work. Also i think they rushed the game to be released before Xmas bc fans were getting anxious for it. they shouldve waited until New Years or afterwards bc that wouldve given them time to fully polish the game. Im sure there will b more updates, DLC, or another installment to complete all the endings.
Calling freddy calls him to the spot you pressed the call freddy button, so if you go past that spot after calling him, he doesn't come to you, he still goes over to the spot you called him in originally
freddy letting monty go first just shows how he is just a kind soul, but mark needed him so monty wouldn't kill him.
I can't wait to see someone animate this there's a lot of good moments
🔴JUST GOOD PEOPLE WILL SUBSCRIBE 🔴
look i’m not going to sit here and pretend like this game is perfect because it really could’ve been so much better if they just spend more time on it but at a point we all have to acknowledge that a lot of mark’s problems in this game are directly his problem from not paying attention😭
FREEDDDEEEEEEEEEEEH
i was in so much pain watching mark try going to the charging stations when the game told him they wouldnt work 😭
The moon Random jumpscare nearly made me splash hot tea allover myself 🌚🔫
The most scary part of it Mark :"I will find you"
Jumpscare Timelines 7:29 10:45 12:23 27:53 28:26 29:14
instructions: *very clear* mark: no
HAppy holly day Mark
"FREDDY FREDDY FREDDYYYYYYYY"
We need roxi raceway mini game and Monty golf mini games
28:44 I'M WHEEZING😂😂😭
Go to Monty golf get the Mazersize pass Go to mazersize Go to day care theater Find control key Spend 5 hours finding the right combo Go in vent  Beat Monty boss Go back to Roxy raceway  Find door that leads down Use both upgrades to go on elevator  You can find out the rest from there
Congrats! You're also early and found this comment
Hey Markiplier, I saw you on tv my boi
I love how Mark was screeching “FREDDY” and Freddy was just like “haha wonder who that could be”😂
ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS THEY DIDNT ANIMATE THE FUCKING ENDING
FAZDAD NO
I love how he said he needed both upgrades and that he can get the true ending when he was basically right
28:41 IM DYING LMAOOO 😭😭😭😂
Are we all going to ignore he just reached 30 Mil subs :O
Just wait until mark has to play through the other endings and finally meet the secret boss:  Spoiler alert, it ISNT scott cawthon
Princess quest l, ll, lll
hey mark i just wanna say the pirate cove its not the pirates is bonnies if u go in front of it freddy says "i do not come up here anymore. i miss him."
Bro the Vanny ending was depressing
That was the bad ending.  You have three possible ones
⚠️SPOILERS⚠️       Right now there are actually six endings to this game and one of them is where you can save Vanessa from Vanny (A.K.A her other persona) what you have to do is play all the princess quest games(3 of them) to free Vanessa( I don’t know how to explain it but something in the princess games are trapping her at the pizzaplex) after that gregory and Vanessa leave the pizzplex together with a still functioning Freddy head.
First ending: *confused wheezing* *Me laughing my ass off*
Markiplier thank you for being my childhood and I mean this without seriousness you are the best YouTuber to ever exist you are the best person to ever exist thank you for what you do
I loved this I was watching this my whole Christmas vacation
Mark forgot to try one thing to try out his faz blaster on Freddy that's mean I know but he can get revenge for the ending of this video
I got jumpscared so bad at 27:54
Wait people, this bot Mishan V account you keep seeing in the comments is someone trying to get another youtuber harrassed, he has the same name but has no proper videos uploads but only has the youtuber he is trying to get harassed videos on his page
brooo ofc freddie running all around, you click and run the call in a huggy game click once and wait for him to come damn
that was such an awkward ending (18 mins into the vid)
You can get two endings that are better than the ones you got. The BEST ending: Go play Princess Quest 2, then do the Vanny choice again (either at the door or at the loading dock) then play it normally and play Princess Quest 3 in Vanny's room to get the ending . Canon ending: Do Monty to get his upgrade for Freddy, then go back to Roxy Raceway. In the raceway on your left when entering is a door leading down. You can open the gates when you have all of Freddy's upgrades. Once you do that take the elevator and enjoy
Will there be another episode?
You’ll find me? Ok I wish you the best of luck because I don’t even know where I live so maybe you could tell me where I live once you find me. Ok bye bye
who else is reliving their childhood?
Yes Mark, Please come find me. I would love to meet you.
Why doe MArk never check the map, doesn't it even tell you where all of the charging stations are on there?
Game: Press F to Pay respect  Mark: *E*
Actually doing everything before 6am seems to be a lot of time management.
Mark: "Freddy. Freddy. Freddy! FReddy! FREDDY!!!!!!" Freddy: "Stop calling me you shi*t, I'm moving as fast as I can."
Subscription earned Mark :)
the theater is for if you chose monty golf instead of fazerblaster
i think vanessas "reward" was just moondrop killing you. the whole point of that was to get you to wait on stage 'till 6am for him to get you
Anyone else notice the Baby doll at 22:34
No he goes to where you are when you call him so you have to wait you cant call him and keep running
Shits lame
Good news! It is almost a cock!
There are multiples endings.
28:40 funniest moment
The true 3 star ending is unlocked by beating all the princess quest games
Did anyone else skip him screaming like a little girl?
You should play last of us 2
Im dying laughing please someone animate this FREDDDYYY
the game got ruined by people who promote cancel culture and get offended by everything.  When Scott left, the game was left to rot down to what it is now.  It's still super fun but its not as good as it couldve been
Mark plays so much more cavalier than he probably should xD. He's sprinted into so many security bots by blindly rounding corners.
This game is shit
22:34  am I the only one who noticed the circus baby
i agree, the environment is crazy detailed but they honestly do so little with everything it’s kinda disappointing. i’m guessing they were developing a very different game but due to some kind of restraints it caused them to change the major gameplay  this would also make sense as to why the actual story is a bit lacking, it feels like they never do anything with vanny or really do much plot wise
freddys like “Im on my way!” as he pasts mark🤣
The reason why the game feels abit "unconnected" and how theirs alot of bugs and things is because people where rushing Scott to finsh the game, he didn't get to put everything in because of how everyone was rushing him (If that makes any sense, my English is not very good ^^')
Wow that Vanny ending was… bad. Just bad lol. Genuinely did they run out of budget? Time? Both? That felt so rushed, last minute and jarring to the point that the emotional scene of Freddys death almost came across as comical lol
Mark: "What Happened?! What happened?! What happened?? What happened..? Wha happnd, wha happnd, wha happnd, wha happnd??"  Clock: "it's six o'clock b****."
He can't find me.
the vanny ending almost seems like it was made for literal children
3rd trending in gaming Pog
Mark: To put it simply, the game is unfinished. It appears Vanessa was supposed to be around a lot more, but she's heavily broken, so they removed some parts of her when they released it. The secret on the main stage probably isn't included right now and the Plan A mission is probably an entirely different ending. Also, the game the entire time REALLY REALLY REALLY felt like there was going to be a lotttttt more after 6 am. The endings just to felt really anticlimactic so I was a bit confused. And the vanny ending and secret ending also felt a little anticlimactic. For the vanny ending, you can just run all the way through, and the secret ending, while its a boss fight, is just a little too easy to complete. The whole "no saves thing" is quite stupid, and I'm sure its in place because there is no 'find all collectibles' secret yet, which I would be disappointed if there wasn't because why else would you collect "Foxy Plush" or "Roxanne Frozen Treat". Freddy says that there is more going on in the pizzaplex, but to be honest, their really isn't much more that they show than Vanny controlling the animatronics to steal kids...
"I'll find you"  cool I'll bake us some cookies you can come over and we can chill
There is more than one ending and these ending connects with something.
This hilarious buggy mess at least makes me crack up. When Freddy ran straight past as Mark screamed, that ended me. But I will not be paying 40 dollars for this hot mess of a horror experience.
It is a glitch on FNAF:security breach. it needs a new update. (fix the bug)
This game is ALL over the place..... Its like they switched writers and story boards so many times and then just tried to do it all together.  Also wht is with the comic book ending like what.....
mark: FREDDY!! AHHHH FREDDY YOU BASTARD.      mark: this is the end of the episode. Bye.
agha
The entire place is built on top of the old pizzeria. It is able to be found  and and old friend is found inside we need to alert mark of this. Please spread the word so he finds this springtrap is there!!!!
Can't wait for part 8
will you keep playing security breach or are you done with it?
What an underwhelming game..
Dear Markiplier,  Find the escape car ending guidelines and think it'll be easy fix the save points and recharge  It's Important to collect all collectables and Always recharge Freddy. Save Progress anytime!  The Lore! The Lore! The Lore!
Mark, there is still a lot of game waiting for ya. And the security pass goes up to level 10
If you play the arcade game at the vanny room(after freddy is disassembled)   you can get the best ending where no one dies and you leave with freddy's head
Can’t wait for mark to see the true ending
i had already watched cory's playthrough but i was like super bored waiting for cory to drop pt 7 and decided to watch yours too... watching freddy run past you made it all worthwile we love you mark
Man this would be so much better if Vanessa worked the way she should in the game with the timer and all
i was dying when freddy ran right past him and monty
I really don't think this game was worth the wait. They kept saying that they were putting the release date back to make it a better game and experience, but this is in no way up to par game-wise or story-wise. Disappointing.
I guess Mark hasn't realized that Freddy runs to where you were when you called him rather than just letting you hop in his chest during one of his run cycles
There is more ending
The way mark was running from Monty and the Freddy just runs past him lol
25:07 Fnaf lore in a nutshell
i'm not gonna cry over freddy i'm not gonna cry over freddy i'm not gonna cry- i- okay too late
I can see why Rox had trouble catching you. The eyes clearly have some problems judging by freddy's ability to get to you.
of course markiplier has to get the super glitch that skips the whole month sequence this game is so buggy they shouldn't have released it yet
I will not click the links. Come find me.     Please.
“What happened was moon man got me.  But that doesn’t really matter.  What matters is that I died.  And as you may have guessed: I am going to continue dying several more times before I get to the end.  Which isn’t actually the end because my sense of adventure was pointing me in the right direction.  However, I was misguided.  And it led me down a path of pain and despair.  The bulk of which I will spare you from but I will show you a little bit.  *Because I know that you for some reason  e n j o y  m y  s u f f e r i n g.”*   -Markiplier
That’s an intense outro
28:42 I died, Freddy is messing around at the worst time ever
i would love if they took some of the money from this game and fleshed things out more... probably wont. But we can hope.
Maybe you have to restart to get all of the upgrades in time. The way you spent a lot of time in the laundry and stuff like that might have affected time
I'm sorry if im ruining anything, but was it just me, or does him mocking the end scene where its strip like and mocking the studio kinda anger me? I feel like the fact that every ending has that kind of ending where its strip like, makes it more stuck in your head and just way better.
Mark: *Running from Monty* FREDDDDDY!!!  Freddy: Running My Way Upstairs, finding what the problem is doo doo doo doo doo doo duhh...Huh, seems there is no problem here, Ill just keep running.  28:40 Freddy keeps running  Mark: FWEDDY!!!!!!!! FReDDy!!!! Freeeeedyyyyy!!! ...*looks back* Freddy, don't wait your turn  Freddy: *Watching the Scene Unfold*
The more I listen to it, Freddie sounds like Mark
Did you notice how freddy went from being stiff and emotionless to a fully animate, emotive being?
if Mark doesn't yell "I AM THE KING OF FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDY'S" I'm gonna riot
Is this the last episode?
Mark: FREDDDDYYYY!!!! Freddy: I’m gonna do what’s called a pro gamer move
There is a secret  room but you need the camera to take pictures of posters and then there will be a foxy poster that opens. 😉 good luck
That ending was so badly put together... jesus christ.
I believe that the way Freddy works now is that he comes to every spot that you try to summon him, in order. Which is annoying.
Pls finish five nights with 39 unless i havnt seen it because its not inpossible and you did say something about it on power washing simulator
Waiting for Mark to get the flannel
Scott retired during development that's why the game is so low quality
*in Jules voice* SAY WHAT ONE MORE TIME!
So let me get this straight. One of the endings is killing a person in horrible way with robots for... Undescripted accusations from the head of the little boy, who was in the complex in illegal for guests hours? Right. And i am really pity for animatronics. They're "decomissioned" in unnecessary vicious way...
28:40  best part of the whole video
*Merry Christmas* you all! 🎄
Please try to do a part 8 and get the claws from monty
Jumpscare List:  3:33 Moon 7:28 Moon  10:45 Moon 12:23 Moon 27:52 Security Bot 28:26 Security Bot 29:13 Monty
I love when Mark shouted “Freddy”, it said [Applause] in the closed captioning
Bothers me how mark doesn’t realize there’s a door right from rockstar row to the main atrium
Lmao this game was a buggy mess. More funny than anything sorry you had to go through that mark.
I love how he had no reaction to vanny, A HUMAN, being ripped apart
28:45 HEHE
“Good news! It’s almost a cock!” Lollll
Can someone please clip Mark’s angry, “UH HUH!” To Pretty Fly For A White Guy? I don’t have the skills but I can’t unhear that in my brain now.
God this game looks so bad
Thank you markiplier for starting off with a shitpost
Alternative title: mark screaming FREDDDY for over 30 minutes
That one character I watch the video the same if you'd walked right into a room just stared at her with her eyes inner she would just be as blind as a bat still
Mark figuring out a videogame is like english teachers finding hidden meanings in poetry
28:43 I am totally dead 😂
Markiplier I don't know if you knew this or not but you know where Roxy
the way freddy got ripped to pieces hurt me even when he scream scared me and hurt me.
mark, it's not a "come to me" button, it's a "go to that spot where i pressed the button" button
am i wrong but isn't rockstar row right next to the front exit? coulda sworn it was. i can't keep the pizzaplex map right in my head glad he found the way out tho XD
BRUGH MARK I SAW TOU IN AN ADVERTISEMENT ON LIVE TV
Mark, Freddy doesn't come to you when you call him. He goes to where you were when you pressed the button. :)
the way freddy run past gregory looks like that meme from umbrella academy 😭😭💀
damn, this game sucks
Game: exit the pizzaplex! Recharge stations are offline so they cant protect you!  Mr. Plier: gotta get to the recharge station
I’m still wondering what they found drilling into the foundation of the building, you needed montys claws I think to get through the fence. Matpat theorized that the pizzaplex was built under something but now im wondering if the pizzaplex was built over something
Mark: “FREDDY!! FREDDY WHERE ARE YOU?!?!?”   Freddy: *Walks straight over to Monty*
hey mark? it's like 8am...we need part 8 omg  I'm kidding, take your time, we appreciate everything you've done for us but I just wanted to say hi😋
Y’all laughing and stuff but tbh I would just find it incredibly frustrating and unfun that Freddy has terrible AI
Freddy running away from Gregory and failing Mark TWICE in this video is the absolute highlight for me 5:00-6:23 28:03-29:21
That Freddy rushing by Mark moment feels like it should be featured in a "Top Ten Anime Betrayals" compilation
I have no idea why I love the story/plot so much or why I find it fascinating but I do and I don't mind it at all
EARLY
27:41
lookin' a lil' sus at the end, mark... 30:11
there is a secret ending and springtrap is in it
he summons to the first place you call him from.  all the constant calling him will do nothing once he's already on his way.  so yeah, running away from the place you call him will have him go past you.
The first guy in the video “Hog Calling Contest” sounds like mark just calling for Freddy minus the corn hat.
28:42 freddy said nope😂
I heard that they rushed development and that's why a lot of the game is buggy and rushed
MERRY CHRISTMAS, MARKIPLIER! (Its already 25 here)
28:30
I always just assumed that Freddy would run to the point to where you first pressed Q, not dynamically to the player's position
The game went so good at start but the end? I mean…
THE END OF THE VIDEO BAHAHAHAHA😭💀💀💀
Gregory, I think you deserve a  r e w a r d 😏 check the main stage 💕  Vanessa
he will find you
yeah cuz when you summon him he goes to the spot where you called him i think if you summon him he should just keep running to you until he is within a specific radius
Freddy: You are my superstar...   Markiplier: *Vacuum noises*
I love how mark is in denial when hes panicking. like: "I know your there." NO YOU DONT "I see you" no you CAAAANNNNNTTTT *animatronic nearby* you cant see me. you cant see me you cant see me
👀
R.I.P. Freddy.
The main stage is clearly a trap, why would Vanessa give someone she doesn’t like a gift
Your on the right track mark just to let you know
Oh the humanity Comedy chase scene of Markiplier. Enjoy the show if your watching this? LOL XD 27:52
This whole game is just a fever dream
Merry Christmas Eve, Mark!!! 💕🥰❤💕❤💕🥰
..
Fnaf fans: scott has never made a fnaf game both scary and heartbreaking. only scary. Scott Cawton: hold my beer
I like how spring trap is chilling in the vent you can glitch into
Someone please put a beat on that 7:35
True ending
Mark u coulda pushed the button to the main stage lmao it was just glitches
there is like 5 more endings
theres more endings
HOLD UP! EXPLAIN THE BABY PLUSHY!!!!!!! 22:30 ! ( maybe five seconds after, top right on the  table)
28:37 this shit is so funny, I couldn't stop laughing for 5 minutes straight lol
Mark screaming for Freddy when Monty pops out X'D
The game is interesting but ... damn, how did they butcher their storytelling that much ? Nothing makes sense ! At no point in the game are we taught about disappearances, but somehow, now that's why gregory is here, why ? (And that's clearly not the only illogical thing, like for example how Freddy is helping the kid just because "oh no I don't trust the security guard" - I mean I don't know everything on the game yet so there might be an explanation for that)
game: "it's almost 6:00AM get out of here"  Mark: "not yet 5 more minutes"
Mark how the fuck have you not learned at this point that Freddy runs to where you last pressed the button, not to where you actually are?
this game is so confusing bro like honestly what was that comic book ending
I wish the endings were made as cutscenes but well its also unique in a way portraying it as a comic i guess
YESSS I WAS WAITING FOR THIS VIDEOO
if you go back to roxy's raceway and get the robot head again it glitches the time backwards and lets you save again, while also letting you get all the endings
Mark, you should win an award for the way you torture yourself. I think that's far enough.
I would really like to see an animation of Mark screaming for Freddy while Monty is chasing him
This guy seriously forgot he could hide, and thought Freddy was his only escape
Mark: FREDDYYYYYYY Freddy: Oh hi Gregory, sorry, cant talk to you, i need to find Gregory.
Markiplier, there's a point in the monty mission where you have to go to a place called Masercize, you need to look at the guide online because without the specfic combination for the maze it takes forever to get through the vent you need to get through in the maze.
Merry Christmas mark form ph!!!
I don't really enjoy him suffering, i feel bad he had to get jumpscared so much
everyone: NO FREDDY GONE mark: dID thEY rUn oUT oF bUdget fOR tHe lAst aNImatION
What a weird, out-of-touch game this was.
coming from my amazing searching and youtube vids id say be prepared mark i believe springtrap is in this in a "boss fight"
There are plenty of other secrets!! I feel like there's one you could find thats the Canon end and it's right up the alley of the traditional play style of the original games. Of course only if your dwindling sanity permits it ^^"
Freddy does a little trolling
markiplier: are you serious, are you serious? me: im not serious black
I feel like they were out of budget the whole game tbh, big map/nice graphics but something is a bit... _retarded_
try going to the main stage, vanessa said she has something for you
Ok idk if your going to see this but there is a good Vanny ending where you complete all of the princess quest games in order. This actually frees Vanny so when you get to the exit and click Vanny you get the ending where you keep Freddy’s head and Vanessa/Vanny becomes your mother sort figure(it looks like she is because Gregory we can tell is an orphan)(I’m thinking that Vanny will be able to re-build Freddy because of her being controlled by glitchtrap so most likely he would have shown her how to do many engineering things) 😅 I do hope that you do try to get this ending because I have only heard of it (there were/are in fact when I learned about them 6 different endings) sorry this is a really long comment😅
*inhale* FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I love that Mark realizes that he missed a bunch of things
The vanny ending where Freddy...you know ....I absolutely hated it every second of it
8:15 Well, time to like because I enjoy Mark's suffering.
jumpscare list for all you hiding in the comments: 1:04 - freddy (small) 3:34 - death 6:14 - moon (small) 7:30 - death for some reason 10:46 - moon (terrifying) 12:24 - moon 23:10 - caution bot (small) 27:54 - bot 28:27 - bot 29:14 - monty 30:28 - closing vanny jumpscare the video is quite confusing dont you agree, hope this list helped u guys though x
28:40
25:12 So I could be wrong here, but I'm pretty sure Mark just said in the nicest way possible that this game is unpolished and janky. And only watching his gameplay and not playing it myself, that seems pretty generous.
Mark, after choosing to stay, if you go to Roxy's raceway back to where you got the busted STAFF bot head and collect it again, it'll glitch the game and set the time back a few hours, so you'll be able to use the save points again and you can continue to explore without worrying about losing a ton of progress.  PS you NEED the Monty claw upgrade to unlock the true ending
I’m sorry right after they ran out of budget for the first ending mark got I was in utterly shocked WTAF was that!?
Thank you mark! I have been so stressed lately but you running around screaming "FREDDY" while freddy runs past you has me laughing so hard Im wheezing.oh my god lol.
This episode was aggravating. And it was all Marks fault. Don't fucking spam repeat the same two words for a solid 25 sec, don't rage at the game working as intended when you are the one spamming the call freddy button and then run away from the point you called freddy to. Seriously Mark.
I love that Mark is an actual child because he doesn't listen to any instructions and breaks the game
love the meme at the start
Feel free to disagree with me here. If we look over the bugs, lack of atmosphere in most parts, 3d visuals and other design choices, the game, to me (and i’m sure to many others) is disappointing. I don’t think this is really entirely scott’s or steelwool’s fault either. Mega projects like this are often hit or miss and unfortunately this is a miss. I myself am not too bothered by visuals or the gameplay style, what frustrates me is the story telling. The pace of the story is awkwardly written, which shows in in the game, where parts feel rushed or don’t really make sense. The New characters in no way feel relevant whatsoever to the previous games and half the time i’m wondering why they are there. Sure Vanny is a good character in the short term but where on earth does she, monty and the sun/moon guy fit in the big picture? The endings are nice in some parts but some really don’t feel any different from the others.  How could this have been fixed? I personally think that the developers should have focused more on the gameplay and spooky atmosphere before implementing the story. This means that they could figure out what parts of the story they should cut out or add in depending on how the game plays. What made the old fnaf games GREAT was finding out things on the side where you’re ‘not supposed to look’ I understand that this will have been implemented for some other lore in the game, but i am confused why they didn’t do this for the main story but maybe made the things to look for more obvious.   Sometimes it just feels that the game is just a hot mess of a lore dump.  Another thing that i find confusing is why they didn’t use this game as something to work off of sister location, a game that also broke the mould of the other games and deserves more lore, this would have been a great opportunity for security breach to work off of, and would make more sense to implement different gameplay mechanics!  The use of the security level to access different areas is a good concept but also is very jarring and frustrating at the same time.   the design choices for the animatronics are also interesting, the cheap, flashy mcdonald’s toy look to them simply isn’t human enough, and doesn’t dive far enough into the uncanny valley, this is why they don’t seem creepy (apart from music man, he was brilliant) and why all of the jump scares seem slightly off.   Don’t get me wrong this game has it’s great moments, but overall I think it missed a lot of opportunities to make something great. I understand that this game was meant to switch things up. But in doing so it forgets all the strengths of the previous games, trying to be too much all at once.
Mark please stop getting fnaf security breach in my recommended😂 ima wait until I get it to get the full experience
Fun fact markiplier , shoot the sign robots with the laser and they spin :)
Merry Christmas ☃️ 🥰🥳🎄💙
Play the 3 princess quest games and the third one is in vanny ending.  The others are around the map.  Also you are one of my favorite youtubers.
28:40
Vanny: *orders the S.T.A.F.F. bots to disassemble Freddy* Me: "OH NO! SHE'S HOT!" Edit: 15:17
Mark screaming freddy has me WEAK LOL
I don't think they play tested this game very well.
I don’t enjoy your suffering mark :(
Take a load off Mark, Freddy needs time to think about his actions 😂😂
Take Freddy to Bonnie's bowling
There a secret ending we're you go to the old pizza place
7:38
Princess Quest
Wait.. wtf lmao 🤣 I barley watch the video an the first thing is Freddy saying it’s almost a cock.😭😂😂😂
I hope mark knows that theres like 20 endings, it'll be a little hard to find like the full on true ending and they're all in the comic format thing 👍
Am I the only one who feels bad for Roxy and her insecurities. And Chica's eating disorder.
did they spend all of their budget on the intro cinematic for this game? even the pre rendered ending seems so incredibly rushed.
27:51
"Good news, it's almost cock" 🥵
I'm finding this way to funny, the way Freddy keeps getting lost :)) Like......I can't breath (^-^)
28:42 <---- for your personal usage
Mark: Freddy! Freddy runs pass him Mark: Freddy!!!!
28:02 please someone animate this XD
I hope we get at least one more video from Mark with him getting the true ending. He is the king of FnaF after all. YOUR CROWN IS ON THE LINE HERE MARK!
Marionette (puppet) looks like the broken security guards
I love this series sm, thanks for being one of the greatest youtubers out there and posting thousands of videos💯❤👍
Never thought I would hear greedy say 🐓
Welp, Markiplier’s Spotify got hacked lol Is it Vanny’s revenge? Lol 😂
Freddy: *Litteraly flops on the floor and dies*  Markiplier: OruFg pHf PrrfhhhhhHHHHHHHHHHH SKSSMSOWOAKkkzzk hAHAAHAAAAAAAA hhhAAAAA HHHHHHHHHH
please mark do another so we can see monty upgrades
Is there going to be a part 8?
0:04 New FNF mod just dropped
Markiplier: WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT HAPPENED! WHAT HAPPENED! Markiplier voice over: you see you died from the moon and also your sense of adventure even tho it's killed you 5 times.
I can’t wait and see this being animated
the game needs some updates to be honest
does that happen the same if you have the claws?? Also are they adding an update to add a foxy section?
"Freddy! Freddy! No, don't wait your turn!"
There are different ending in the game
15:19 oh... oh damn
Everyone else at the whole Freddy dying scene: *realizes he was loyal and is crying* Mark: *confused wheezing*
HAH AT 28:39 (somewhere there) FREDDY RAN PAST MARK AND THAT WAS THE BEST THING EVER
Freddy is such a polite man at the worst times
Hey
Markilplier's daily affirmations!! Repeat after me:  "I will find you. I will find you. I will find you"
27:53 favorite YouTube clip ever
you probally wont see this however here is a clue for the true ending: get all the upgrades for freddy find the hidden area in the raceway wont say anything more, but you are gonna like it.
Freddy: that’s my boy :]  Freddy seeing Gregory being chased by monty: Oh no, my boy!  Gregory: *FATHER, HELP-*
This series is so good 🔥
Mark: * being chased by Monty while screaming Freddy's name while going down the stairs*  Freddy: *runs past him and goes up the stairs*  Mark: FREDDY YOU B*TCH
So the police in this universe aren't concerned about the many mysterious missing children cases that all center on a pizza restaurant?
this game is so shit lmao what happened to fnaf
The last 3 minutes of this video had me laughing so hard this was almost as funny  when mark played getting over it
Freddy running past mark and up to Monty made my day. I haven’t laughed that hard in a long time. Freddy you bitch! 🤣🤣🤣
28:42 Im fkin dying
10:25
BRUH ! I slamed my desk when he got caught at the end cuz Freddy was trolling him !!!!! aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  DISAMBLE FREDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
The weird disconnect from when Gregory mentions disappearances just threw me off so much. Like when was this mentioned?
You should do all the endings
you'll never know why I got so many likes
*me feeling terrible that freddy dies*  Mark: "Did they run out of budget for the last animation?"
Five nights at Cut corners: A fuck bois prelude.
If you stay you can still save
Keep playing, there still more secrets yet unsolved in that pizzaplex
post part 8 now please
Just Mark screaming his head off calling Freddy while Freddy's going up the stairs nonchalantly as if he doesn't have a care in the world
I’m waiting for episode 8 😀
This game.... is pretty rough to say the least
you know you got chica's beak right to stun animatronics man gotta remember sometimes HAHAHAHA
Come find me then 🕺🏻.
Maybe it's minor, but I'm still sad Mark doesn't want to play the princess game. I mean, minigames usually have bonus content that's story related in this series, right?  And I'm never great at the minigames, so I never see that content on my own. 😔
What Happend What Happend What Happend What Happend What Happend What Happend What Happend What Happend What Happend What Happend What Happend 7:29
so am i the only one that thought it was funny that freddy waited his turn to walk down the stairs after monty? lmaoooo
and make happy ending pls
titanfall 2
Best moments .. Freddy running past Markiplier, and then he just casually walks behind Monty
Moondrop must be buggiest charachter
You should play the Observation Duty series. It'd be a good break from scheduled content, and it's a unique horror experience.
Mark: there’s no way that’s actually the ending!! steel wool: yes, actually there’s S E V E N    (I actually have heard many things, there’s only six known endings, and like a couple endings are bugged? I’ve even heard that there’s 9.)
17:59
Mark: im gonna try and go into a charging station cause that's how you get away from moon man. Me: *screaming at my computer* YOU CANNOT GO INTO THEM ANYMORE DUMMY!!!!!!
13:22 Freddy gives me goosebumps, you know, the good ones,... Freddy comes closer, ... even MORE goosebumps 26:21 The Comedy Bot usually talks and tells jokes.
Yessir #1 trending lets go!  *Was*
all the ending are so rushed and stupid, this game should not have been released this early it's so disappointing
Lol Mark would complete the Bad Vanny Ending first! Out of the 6 ending you wouldn't even go for the good lore ending! Mark's ability to get lost will not be able to locate or unlock the True Ending lol.
Vanny Ending* Markiplier: Sobbing* Viewers: Feels sad too* Markiplier: Sobbing* Did they run out of budget?
only ogs know where he got the outro from and its still a bop to this day
Well, that ending looked more like a "bad ending" route. By staying to make the last upgrade on Freddy we might get deeper into the rabbit hole, but the game becomes hardcore with no chance to save even after a long looooong trip around the facility plex. Man, these guys don't know the word about "checkpoint". Imagine playing a game for more than an hour without saving -- oh yes, a roguelike, but this game is a frustrating do the same thing along the same damn hallways all over again. Not to mention the fact that Moon can glitch across walls and bump into you if you are at an earshot of him, which is ridiculous. Then Monty is immune to your fazblast and a single bad bump into a corner with a STAFF can spell your doom instantly. But OK, Mark is above frustration, we all know it 😂
He got softlocked bruhhhhhhh
Jesus that outro was brutal lol
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation?" Do you want to hear Vanny being "disassembled?"
Everything is actually utilized, when you had the choice for Laser Tag and Mini Golf, you would visit the other places in the plex. I know bc I chose golf and it gave me a camera instead of a laser gun.  It's super cool how that choice at the beginning make you miss so much else.
28:36 Freddy: we do a little trolling
Markiplier I want continue of carrion
The fact u always post these when I’m asleep smh
99% of this gameplay is Mark going insane.
mark going to the main stage after it obviously being a trap for moon to get him: this is great! I love this! Game is so easy!!
Every youtuber in this ending: NOooooooo :( Markiplier: HAHAHAHAHAHA DID THEY RUN OUT OF BUDGET?!?!
Freddie running past mark was the best part of this episode
tbh this is as bugged as cyberpunk, such a letdown
Hope he gets to molten freddy
9:25 Why does she say this so sexually? XD
that'd actually be cool if you can come find me, would love to meet you even if you meant that by your gonna kill me lmfao.
I think the theme music of Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Simulator and the elevator music here in Security Breach sounds are the same. Did anyone noticed?
I love that every fnaf game gives you several different endings you have to discover.
28:43 😂😂😂 Top ten Anime betrayals
Can't wait for the compilation video on this game
Mark insanity simulator part (?) Also marks suffering is my vibe Does he forget that misdion are sometimes optional or other paths?
BRO LIKE 7 PARTS ALREADY GODDAMN
His name is moondrop not moon man
Hi
Its really triggering how everybody keeps calling for Freddy and then be mad that the pathfinding is glitching around. Just call Freddy if you need him god dammit. Great video otherwise.
ok well i don't enjoy watching his suffering i enjoy watching him figuring out what he has to do and then failing multiple times and finally succeeding so he can move on with the game
Lol Freddy
A day later and this is STILL #1 on trending. Good job on getting everyone together to see you play this, Mark.
THE CHARGING STATIONS ARE OFFFFFFF MARK. It literally tells you 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Me: on the verge of tears during the first ending. Mark: *wheezes in laughter*
brb crying
mark:  you for some reason enjoy  my suffering also mark: *is a masochist*
Freddy: *dies horribly* mark: *kettle noises*
Mark:  FREDDYY!!!!!!!! His mom: SHUTUP ITS 2AM GEEZ
What the fuck just happened
at 19:22 it looks like markis starting to flip u off  Edit but just want to say i think mark should go for the secret trash rabbit ending
There is a way to save in 6 am. I can imagine other people have left these comments but on the off chance youve seen none but this, if you collect the racing bot head in roxy raceway again, itll put the in game time to earlier in 5 am, which changes nothing BUT your ability to save is brought back so I highly recommend using this, even though its a bug. Post game is really annoying without it.
Lixian editing the Caution bots to just constantly have a weird nose and thumping bass alert sound whenever they look at you... great editing, but jeez, those spook the bejeezus out of me more than anything else.
Mark, there is technically a “True Ending”! There are 2, the first one is playing all 3 of the Princess Quest games IN ORDER. To find the first one, you need to get to the entrance to Roxy Raceway and go the beauty salon instead of the actual raceway, the first game will be in the back, play it and beat it, then go to the Music Man area in the arcade, in the very back area there was a arcade game for Princess Quest II, play it then go to the exit again and click “Vanny”, the last Princess Quest game is INSIDE Vanny’s hidden room, so instead of pressing the button, you play the last Princess Quest game. The other ending requires you to have Monty’s Claws and Chica’s Voicebox, then go to the Northeast section to Roxy Raceway, there will be a door that leads down to a elevator, you need to use Freddy’s new claw upgrade to break down the gate, then use Chica’s Voicebox to open the gate after that, when you get into the elevator you will be given a choice, keep in mind the 6am Autosave will change from the choice section to the area at the bottom of the elevator, there will be a boss fight down there, I won’t say against WHO, but I’ll say that Roxy, Monty, and Chica appear, and to get defend against Chica, shut the door she goes to (I recommend waiting until she’s about to get in to shut it), for Monty, shut the vent (again, I recommend waiting until he’s about to get in), for Roxy, she won’t be stopped by the doors, so you need to hide in Freddy and use the Voicebox ability on her to make her run away, there is also a weird black vine thing that’ll show up, all I’ll say is to get in Freddy and run into it, it’ll drain all of Freddy’s power and he’ll go into the recharge station, I hope you do these 2 endings!
I've never heard marks voice at a higher pitch than when he screams for Freddy
30:21 We happy few 2 leaked?
Security Breach: A Summary. "What is happening?" "What just happened?"
pLEASE this was the best intro
why did i start crying at the comic when freddy died
Freddy is the Security Breach version if Roach
Imagine, if the final boss IS Freddy, WE improve hime during all the game. And sometimes he Attack Grégory when his stamina IS empty, imagine him with all these new improvement, trying to catch us
According to wiki, apparently this game was meant to be released much earlier (it's original release date was Dec. 25th, 2020), but they postponed its release because the developers thought they could make the game much bigger than it was planned to be. The empty spaces in the pizzeria and the weirdly disparate and dissonant dialogue/story bits, from what I've seen, may be a remnant of that decision.
every episode there is a cut over of him not understanding something 😭
every single minute of this video felt like a fever dream, i swear. :DD
There are more easter eggs @markiplier
If mark backs out of this and doesn't upload anymore he ain't the true fnaf king not even 0.00000.00000.00001% not even a king, lmao I love those ppl that commented that the king of fnaf was back lmao
There's a thing that happens when you try to go the slide again to the daycare
Mark you need to complete the Princess quest arcade to get an ending. The arcade must be played in order else the other ones won't work.
Never thought I'd see the day where Mark desperately wants Freddy to come to him.
When your voice distorts, it sounds just like The Whale in The Edge Of Sleep
Mark: click on the links or I will find you.  Me: …well if you’re finding me like Freddy was “finding” you, I think I’ll be safe 😅🤣🤣🤣
This was a good thing to watch on my birthday:)
i'm not guna click the links
Don't try to make sense of any of the endings because they absolutely suck. The game is good but the endings are absolute crap.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 ending pure gold
28:40 for all those who want a perfect replay.
You probably need to choose Monty golf instead of fazer blaster to decommission Monty and get the upgrade
Mark....you have the fazer blaster.... *facepalm*
9:27  Rule34 artists are enjoying this
When you click “vanny” it’s a sad ending. Because the robots destory Freddy.
Hi Mark I have a problem I’m trying to open your link for destructible but it seems to not work they bring me to a site that is not the podcast site and I’m sure I’m not the only one
The KING at his finest.
Freddy's way of pathfinding is way too simple where he just follows the path you take instead of go where you are
If you pick up the broken staff bot head in Roxy raceway (again) it enables save stations.    This has probably been commented a bunch already but the more times the more chance of Mark actually seeing it, I guess
So incredibly funny, I loved this so much
love the thumbnail
I have seen quite a few endings but my favorite one is where u free Vanny
There are multiple endings. The first ending you got wouldn't be possible if you would go the other rout (Getting the ''faz cam'' instead of the ''fazer blaster''). There are also multiple routs, that is why you didn't get to see some of the areas.
I love your videos, please make more!
"what happend?" "what happend?" "what happend?" *100 times the same question further..*  "WHAT HAPPEND??!!"
There is a save glitch you can do to make this way way easier, go to roxy raceway and get the robot head again its glitched but that's good, after you have it you can save from then on
Markiplier you forgot the announcement where it said all charging stations will not be powered on that’s why you can’t go in then
The comics show that it isn’t one of the possibly true endings, there’s the princess quest ending which is a comic but has 3 stars, and then there’s the afton ending which is fully playable with no comic. That would make that most likely the true ending
This video is an animation goldmine for Freddy cucking mark
The fact that mark doesnt realise that freddy goes to the location where he was called makes it all the more hilarious
Hey mark take freddy to bonie's bowling behind the ice cream for the narration. ✌
that intro surprised me lmao
There's 7 endings 😢
20:34 That door is clearly closed Freddy, there is no way going out of there. Unless you intend to walk through the door.
Freddy: is basically dead Mark: wheezes
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation? " Genuinely that was one of the most sensible questions I ever heard
18:00 Mark turns into kettle (also thanks for the fastest like I’ve ever gotten)
@markiplier find the princess quest arcade games, they hold the answer
28:42
the screaming shrill voice of Mark's for Freddy was having me chuckle something else, man. ahahah!
Markipoo
That plan A thing is new for me. Now I’m intrigued
“FREDDY, FREDDY, FREDDY, OMG LET ME IN! FREDDY! FREDDY YOU LITTLE BITCH!”
I swear mark I clicked the links down below
Mark passing the main entrance 5 times without noticing
28:42 FREDDDDYYYYYYY
Your thumbnails give me so much nostailgia
Mark: What are you doing here, you're early. Me watching this 16 hours after it was uploaded: Pretty sure I'm not
What i keep screaming at the screen since the part 1 - "Turn off that damn flashlight!". And Mark still surprised how every single enemy knows where is he hiding...
damn. He didnt find the Golden Freddy Plushy That Gives You The Afton Ending.
Veronica is  manipulated by glitch trap/ William aften and when Veronica is possessed by will becomes vanny and kills people. Add on: in your next vid of fnaf look for cds so you can learn about vanny/ Veronica and to be able to use them you need to get Monty’s hands by going to Monty’s place and shoot something to knock it on him and them steal his hands and then go down to the basement and break the fence with the yellow ribbon I think and go into the room and you’ll see and Machine for your cds there’s 14 cds in total.
Mark : click on the link or i will come find you  Me: come find me bitch lets see hiw you di with 6.8 feet karate black belt (not me (
Don't forget to do the 'leave' choice mark
What makes no sense is that Freddy somehow dies even tho most of him is in tact but Monty, chica and Roxanne all live
A lot of the issues with the game,in my own deduction, mainly come from fans rushing Steelwool. It seems Steelwool was first going to focus on visuals and over all environments before the actual AI. Once they released a trailer we saw that right off the bat, most fans assumed that with graphics like this, the game was most likely already in it's final testing phases, when in reality,  it was far from done.           After this the fans continued to push Steelwool to release it, or release more content around it. Steelwool, fearing that if they prolonged the game would lose the audience, pushed it out knowing that there was still room to improve. As a result the game was extremely rushed and felt incomplete, not on the part of graphics, but the AI. The game most likely would've been better if they were given an extra 6 months or so to enhance the horror and gameplay elements.            Also, I would like to point out that a lot of what Mark seems to struggle with is kind of his on fault; Spaming the Freddy call expecting it to go to the right place, not paying attention to important dialog, attempting to find short cuts to things that need a lot of thought(like when he tried to run past Chica in the kitchen after giving up on looking for a door), etc. I guess it's most likely because this game is so different compared to other Fnaf games, and Mark still needs to adjust.
BUG TO SAVE AFTER 6AM. Apparently of you go back to Roxy Raceway and pick up the bot head again it tricks the game into thinking it's 5.15am, while still being able to do the 6am things, and you can use the saves.
*It’s funny how mark gets surprised and starts laughing when he gets bad endings.*
It's the fact that if all the people I've watched play this game mark is having the most problems it's too funny
Get Monty’s claws and go to the sink hole in Roxie raceway
Fun fact: Getting in the charging station without Freddy to get him to where you are isn’t a glitch and is actually a in game mechanic, it just can’t be used at 5:50-6:00am because of them all being locked so you can’t escape Moon
Mark: running for his life callimg for freddy  Freddy: cya bud Mark: fredeeeeeee!
if you go back and get the damaged robot head you can save again
Freddy: “Charging stations can’t help you now!”  Mark: “This sign can’t stop me because I can’t read!”🖤🖤🖤
It’s interesting seeing how much of the game doesn’t make sense unless you know the law 🤔
I just want to say I almost hit 30 subs it’s not a lot tho 😅 sorry btw love your security breach
anyone realize there is 4 upgrades or was i tripping
No it was because you got the wort ending
alternate title: i get tortured by moonman while inside freddy       13:30 this dialog reminds me of a certain furry game that did the same split up AND the same kind of choices
you are right on the nose with it being different then what it was going to be. I lot of things had to be rearranged, some stuff had to be cutted off and scenes in the trailers were removed. This game was posted too early because of the toxic fan base. All the issues is getting patched but its a slow process because of how many bugs there is. Its sad..
Would you try to find all endings as usual or the Easter eggs?
Theres good ending and bad . Please Play good ( stay) ör leave
Basic summary of this video: Basic summary of Mark during said video: Ignoring the game as usual. FREDDY!!!  Basic Summary of Freddy during said video: Running past Mark. No clue where to go.  Almost forgot. Basic Summary of S.T.A.F.F Bots during said video: Cucking Mark as usual.
Meen, missing secret boss fight :(
ur bad lololololollolo get better
Mark’s frantic hand moving while he’s explaining stuff has gotten bigger
That kid is so embarrassing I will never be giving him any money 👎
There is another ending make part 8
Mark screening FREDDY!!!!! is just hilarious 🤣
The amount of screaming this man does every day is---  Mark: Freddy! Freddy, I need you! Freddy: *passes him almost the whole episode* *Mark every 5 seconds*: FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY!!! Freddy: *ignores him because Mark is yelling at him*  Good job Freddy, you completely killed Mark.
I definitely feel like constantly calling freddy to your current location would confuse the pathing as to the shortest route there
I guess people don't play inscryption anymore 😔😔😔
there is a secret ending with springtrap
I’m seeing a lot of people responding to bots in the comments. Don’t give them attention because the algorithm looks at the number of comments and not the content. Just report them so they don’t get the attention they crave :)
Unbeknownst to mark, once you chose to stay you can actually save your game again
Everyones loves to look so smart being like: "the game says recharge stations won't work" when the same game tells multiple times to get to the recharge station during that moon phase
The game is brilliant imo, just needs abit of polishing on glitches and story
one of the ways to get a good ending is to play all of the princess quest games, the first ones in like a hair salon in Roxy raceway, the second one is where you got chased by the big spider guy, and the third one is in vannys hideout in fazer blast, but you gotta play them all in order
there is one extra vanny ending but you need to play princess quest 1 and 2 so that you can play the third one inside vanny's room instead of dissasemble her there is also one ending for each exit the main one as an ending if you leave the same goes for the dock and the other exit and there is also a secret ending that you need to stay to achieve
That monty chase part and Mark screaming FREDDY literally made my day lmao
"The charging stations are offline" "Are you serious?" (X50)
Markiplier Here is my Tip: 1.Go to Vanny's Room 2.Find an arcade game that says Princess Quest3 or 2 Complete the game and TaDa Good Ending
I blame Freddy for Mark not making this episode longer
You missed a lot in the game
I think Freddy works off a system of every time you call for him he checks every point you called for him to first so spamming and running messes it up
Super secret ending is true ending
I imagine this game suffered under Scott's retiring. As it was in development when he left.
Hey Mark, you can save in the 6am hour via a glitch. If you go back to Roxy raceway, the driver assist head has respawned. Pick it up and it will rewind time to a point where the save stations are not disabled and you keep in the 6am hour with the ability to save despite the time showing something else.
18:08 … bruh
I Do Enjoy a bit of markipliers sufferring, it puts me out of my misery and into His :D
Chilling Mark: *Freddy*   Scared Mark: *F R E D D E Y*
This game is so buggy
28:42 LOL
You missed a battery upgrade in the daycare
28:31 This is the funniest moment for me. Mark screaming for Freddy to come- he came but straight up ignored him and passed by LMFAO  Edit: noticed a typo :P
My God this game is pure jank lol
yeh i'm gunna give this one a pass, any intrigue this had has been lost with that poor excuse for an ending. Also I think Mark isn't really enjoying himself, just not attempting to stealth at all sorta feels like he wants to get this over with asap.
lmao that intro tho hahahahahhahaha. idk why tf the cock got me . wait that sounds sus :(
Did anything else think he was going to call Freddy a dork at 20:38? 😂
When I saw the vanny ending i almost cried
This was the funniest episode I've seen xD
20:54 *watchamahoozit*
Freddy is going to the first places mark summons him. Mark's just being a little cry baby
Hey mark if u have the monty claws go to the locked gate at the back of roxy's raceway and the secret ending begins
fr did they run out of budget for the vanny ending ? XD
They definitely ran out of money or time before they could finish the endings properly, huh
Funny observation. Whenever you Pin Freddy he doesn’t home in on Gregory, he comes to the area you pinned. If you move away from that area Freddy will ignore you til he gets to that spot
Technically this game is 1 night at Freddy’s so there’s that Also when mark was laughing at the sad ending that was just so funny
The way that Freddy stares you dead in the eyes while he jogs right past you kills me every time.
Does he realise that he can save after 6am? it was just locked until the entrance
dont worry, mark. we're extremely disappointed in this game too. even as a viewer, i feel frustrated about this game
Mark I love your videos and I thank for what you do I hope you have a great Christmas!
I'm gonna be real this game is probably the weakest one in the FNAF series
*freddy dies* mark:laughs
I think for the main stage thing u have to press the stage button
I almost hate that the ending is neither well done nor taken seriously, it was going so well (even if buggy) and the ending just had to come in and ruin it!
28:30  same energy as "bmo.... BMO!!!"
I think the reason why Mark didn't mange to get Monty claws is because he went to laser gun thing instead of the golf game (I think???) 🤔🤔🤔
i feel like being unable to save after 6AM is a really bad design choice. its at this time the player is meant to go around to game, hunting collectibles, hunting monty, and being unable to save after all of that is a bit BS
well see you tomorrow mark
Good news it is almost a BUCK
the no save shit is really really fucking dumb, why for any reason in gods fuck would they do that, even just a delay between saves would be nice, or limited saves, but no zero saves
This probably happened because Mark took so long doing everything that he literally didn't get to finish the games objectives
Glamrock Freddy is the yassification of Markiplier
There are like 5 endings to this game and none of them are satisfying. Also you need the level ten security badge to unlock an extra Freddy animatronic which changes the outcome of the first ending you showed
#1 trending! Congrats Mark!
i mean......why did you.....leave Freddy too far?
I agree with the areas that were meant to be implemented, like if you use a noclip hack, and you look in to daytime dudes “home”, you can see that it has textures, props, an openable door, so all in all, I agree
30 minutes of fucking nothing again
Freddy doesn't care and goes to the pinged location. Not you lol
this game was definitely not finished. it needed another few months to iron out the numerous bugs and give it an actual ending
i appreciate mark joking about "development issues", and maybe he doesn't know the truth or just doesn't want to get into it, but for those who may want an answer: the fnaf games (and upcoming movie) are under new oversight because it came out that Scott Cawthon is a gross ultra-conservative who has donated $30k+ of his fnaf revenue to incredibly conservative American Republican politicians (and one single anti-trans Democrat), all of whom are heavily anti-lgbt. when called out on it, he doubled down on being conservative and anti-lgbt, despite a large majority of the fnaf fandom being lgbt. so, he's stepped down as the driving force behind the fnaf games, thus why security breach is different, and why the movie will also be different.
I love how everyone thinks the ending was low budget
Well It might not be sure but I think there is some secret when you can found Springtrap as a boss in the facility (Just saw this on a video that explained that but I didn't see a video that really show it yet)
Mark love your content, love distractible, have been a fan for many years now,i think I miss the subnautica videos the 7days to die the uno ones the raft series.i miss the three of you making series videos
Mark this whole game: Gasping
hey Mark! some info for you incase u see this before u make your next video for this game. If you remember there's a S.T.A.F.F head you get and have to repair in order to kill Roxy. You can get that head again when u tell Freddy that you want to stay, grabbing the head during this "free roam" mode where u normally aren't aloud to save will now let u save as long as u have that broken S.T.A.F.F head. I hope this helps u when trying to get the true ending/all the collectables and I hope your successful with it. good luck Mark!
28:41 i’m fucking dead
This game could not have been choreographed worse
i played through security breach and it took me 4-5 days to get every ending it was well worth it because i didnt think they were gonna take parts from another fnaf game for the true ending also heres a hint the true ending is in the basement of roxy's raceway
I think the comics woulda been less jarring if:  the didn't look like they were drawn and after effects edited in like, 2 min, and if they bothered to have them at LEAST voice acted.  It's weird having an emotional depth of very chatty characgters through the whole game delivered dead silent. (save one or two lines)
Inscryption where!!?
Freddy: *dying* Gregory: *crying Mark: *laughing*
Mark: Because I know that you, for some reason, enjoy my suffering Me: We all do, sir
LOL WHEN U SAID "freddy freddy!"  "FREDDY!!"
wow
FREDDY DIED!!!!! WHY DID YOU LAUGHT?! :,(
18:07 we both had the same thought
If you stay you can fight Springtrap
I recommend this new meme hahahahah
It was I controlling him the whole time. Come find me.
Someone explain to me, was there mentioning of "disappearances" in this game until Freddy mentioned it?
Hey Mark, pro tip, but if you go back to Roxy Raceway and collect the STAFF bot's head, it'll bug the game and let you save again.
28:36 😂😂 "FREDDY!!" *freddy stomps past him* "FREDDY YOU BITCH"
This game is broken beyond repair. Why did they release it? It has an alright story and great detail but the bugs make it so inconsistent to play.
Other endings there are
28:32 FREDDY! FREDDY! LET ME IN! FREDDY YOU BITCH!
Freddy said: goodluck superstar I'm low battery
you can try to find me i don't click on the link
First thing i hear good news its almost cock!
Thanks for the video Mark, will be buying this game to have a look round myself. Hopefully there will be a part 8 but I can understand your frustration or you needing a break.
There's actuality a way around the "no saving" thing after 6am that works! If you choose "stay" and go into Roxy Raceway, re-visit the spot where you previously picked up the broken robot head for the Chica quest (back left corner of raceway)  and there will be a new head there.   Picking up the second head makes the game glitch back to 5am, but you get to keep all your items/upgrades and the save terminals are all unlocked again.  This gives you the chance to get the third upgrade you previously missed, and continue finding all the items and secret areas!  Hope this helps a few fellow players out (including Markiplier! I hope he find this out asap) I have tested it on PS5 and it works, I'm currently taking advantage of it 🙂 Makes the post 6am part of the game so much more playable.   Also, I really hope that Mark visits the old elevator in Roxy Raceway once he has fully upgraded Freddy! There is a HUGE Easter egg down there, and one of the secret endings. Well worth the extra effort 👌   Cheers guys!  PS. Can only hope that this 6am save unlock trick isn't patched, but it  likely will be in the near future, so jump on it whilst it exists, folks ☺
Screams for freddy while spamming the button to summon him.   Freddy who was following directions and going to every point he was summoned while mark ran around spamming the button and blaming him:  "Am i a joke to you?"
Alternate endings
upload the next part already
I relate to mark. We sometimes overthink the solution  But also the game is a tad…half baked
Mark you gotta kill monty he replaced bonnie avenge him
Mark! You saw him walk off the stairs please hide yourself for once in your life!😱
ahhh... swearing at freddy like he used to. no more friendly freddy
Freddy: "Charging stations can't help you now!"  Mark: "This sign can't stop me because I can't read!"  Edit: Also mark, this far into the game, not noticing how Freddy goes to the SPOT you press the button, and not Gregory's current location
why is mark like the only guy that didnt dissaasemble monty bcs all other ppl like dan tdm dissasembled all the bots before the ending
There are multiple endings to this game so this isn't the only ending you get
THERE ARE MULTIPLE ENDING PLEASE DO ALL!
So you're telling me, I have to go to a different YouTube channel, to see a different outro?
Being chase by Monty- Mark: “FREDDY!! FREDDY!!!” Freddy: *”passes him completely”* Mark: “FREDDYYYY!!!!!”🖤🖤🖤
Fill free to come find me I'll have coffee ready for when you arrive
This game has around 6 endings.
Mark really wants to disassemble Monty doesn’t he
The places he says aren't polished are because they are for other ways of completing the game
i hope he does the leave ending, just to see what happens
Mark please make fnaf security breach and make True ending
Mark really in the Christmas spirit hitting those mariah carey notes 😻
Mark: FREDDY GET OVER HERE I NEED YOU Freddy: Huh did you say something gregory? Ill be going for my morning jog
Ladies and gentlemen  Its over.
Having wanted to see someone go to the main stage when Vanessa asked, I'm so annoyed that there's literally nothing. I thought at the very least there would be a Vanny attack but just something would have been nice.
9:26 Should I call the FBI?
markipoo my dear beloved youtuber, you are recently brighten up my days (and nights) :D i just cant stop watching your recent and old content xD i start you scary games playlist every night to go to sleep xD keep up being awesome xoxo love you
Focken freddy 🤣🤣🤣
Freddy couldn't bear to face Monty because it made him think of Bonnie, the old bass player...so he ran away
You need to play all 3 Princess quest games to get the true ending
Game's just SO WEIRD XD
Mark’s issues with this game either stem from the game being strangely unfinished or Mark being dumb and refusing to listen to the game.
I love how Mark never realized Freddy's call button summons him to the spot where you clicked the button. So if you walk or run from that spot he still goes to that spot.
Mark screaming for Freddy when Monty was chasing him was pure gold, I haven't laughed so hard or as much in a long time 😂
Freddy! Freeeeddy! FREEEEAAAAAADDDDYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!! 🤣
XD, Freddy is like screw you, you are on your own 28:40
even tough I agree that the ending(s) seem.. out of place, I keep Scot too high to believe he rushed the game. there must be a reason behind all of this..
I'm pretty sad that Mark isn't enjoying this game as much as others did, or as much as viewers did watching gameplay. It doesn't seem like he's as invested to the story or as connected to the characters (esp Freddy, he seems to despise him rather than like him). That said, it's not at all his fault. Like he said, the game is buggy af and is unclear 50% of the time.
28:13 xDDDDD
Try go the bunny’s balling area with Freddy. Hidden message.
This game is good, it really is, but I've been waiting for something... more. Something bigger. I thought Vanny was gonna be the main character, yet she appeared like 2 times and literally did nothing. What about William? What about Glitchtrap? What about all the secrets from Help wanted? I feel like what happened was just.... Gregory running around. And that's all. I expected some cool scenes with  Vanny. How she catches Gregory or something. I expected Freddy to go crazy, just like all the other animatronics. I can't even believe how excited I was at the beginning. Everything looked so great. But when the time reached 6 am, I was like: this is the end? Nothing happened yet! Literally nothing! Where the hell is Vanny? I seriously expected her to appear more. I even expected Vanessa to appear more. God I hope something will change in the other endings because I literally started crying. This dissappointment is unbearable.
Don't worry guys, Markipliers pathing is as good as Freddy's.
I had a thought that the game being a little buggy and such was on purpose to fit into the Fazbear Franchise's vibe since it is well known that their memo is "cheap and unsafe and doesn't work properly" so a game that reflects some of those qualities make it feel more like it's a fazbear thing
Mark the true true ending is the aften ending named after William aften
There’s a cd by the stage to the right only findable with roxy’s eyes
There is 7 ending
THEY DISSASEMBLED MY FATHER FIGURE!? I AM NOT OKAY, TEARS MAN ACTUAL TEARS...
just wanna tell u that this game has many endings
I love markiplier and all but the way he just repeats stuff for an unnecessarily long time makes me so mad 😭
Vanny gets ripped apart being a human.  Mark: 👁👄👁
me: *goes into comments* also me: *only 10 mins into the video*      *so many spoilers*
Vanny ending is so bad. i Bet they added it just to give players who don't care about hidden stuff something to do.
Is anyone else flipping back and forth from Corey and mark during both their series 😂
FREDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
for the first time in fnaf history… someone’s upset when freddy *doesn’t* get to you quickly
I love the thought that Scott FINALLY gets a WHOLE GIANT team to work with, and the game is glitchy and buggy AF.
PLAY PRINCESS ARCADE MARK YOU MISSED OUT ON A LOT
there is more than one ending
Call the Freddy button creates an X on the map where Freddy should go so when Mark spammed the button it created so many spots that Freddy needed to clear before coming to the new one, that's why Freddy ignored Gregory at the stairs
Mark: *trying to figure everything out* Me: *heartbroken because Freddy died*
Not the most broken game in existence
FREEEEDYYYYYYYYYY
“There so way that actually the real ending!” Well, he’s not wrong.
There are multiple different endings
*emotional moment* Mark: Weird noises
Freddy got nerfed hard in this game
5:27 this game seems buggy as the insect section of certain pet stores, g o d d a m n   scott: playtesting? never heard of her, mind setting us up?
new game
Freddy running past Mark, while Mark is screaming .. comedy gold.
I am not proud of saying this but I do enjoy the pain and suffering 😂
I think that they changed this game in the last second because of all the mess that the creator did. Because game in the first trailer and actual game are two totally different things. Also as Mark said there are too many areas that are not used and all the endings just make it weird and messy
Mark: Freddy! Lemme in! Freddy: Hold on, Gregory. You see, I need to take this massive dump. Be right back, superstar! Mark: *FREDDYYYYYYYY!!!*
Maybe different things you do unlock a different storys
what is mission plan A i can’t find it on the internet
New content please, or at least more interesting (technical) games,
The reason Freddy runs past is because Mark was spamming the call button. The coding is set for Freddy to report to the spot where the button was pushed so with him mashing the button, Freddy had to cycle through all the places Mark hit the button. Not broken, just re-worked.
Memento Mori, Unus Annus
Dont tell me i am the only one crying... please..
This game is so so weird I'm not sure what's intentional, bug, or horrible-game-design-that-was-never-tested
I love how mark feels no emotion to Freddy’s death
the vanny part was so rushed
what
You can cause the security S.T.A.F.F. Bots to glitch, but only if you shoot them in the head. Just as Thanos would’ve said.
Mark: " FREDDY DON'T WAIT YOUR TURN!!" As Monty stalks him us to beat part of this video by far lol
I cried when i saw freddy die 🥲 What a champion
Big wow. XD The way it was just like, hey, ya wanna just skip to Vanny very confusingly?
15:29 Die in a Fire, but it's 2021.
these comments are infuriating im just looking for thoughts on the game but its all just (the same) quotes from the video like yeah.i watched it
Mark when venessa says go back to the main stage there is a disk in the middle of the dance floor that what she was telling you to get you need to go into freddy then exit him to see it
I love how mark treats Freddy like a dog
I hope he did eventually realize that the power stations were offline 😂🤣
This game could have been so good, but all the bugs make it hard to play. Also, there are too many endings in my opinion
27:53 Jo. Der. XD
MARK! FREDDY'S SUMMON WORKS AS A LAST KNOWN LOCATION THING! HE'S GOING TO THE PLACE WHERE YOU LAST CALLED HIM NOT TO WHERE YOU ARE, STOP SPAMMING! You only make it worse when you spam.
Is nobody going to talk about how broken this game is? I mean, c'mon, they had a huge budget for the game and they did THIS?!
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation?" nah they ran out for the entire game.
When you think where he said disassemble vanny, vanny is human so her guts got ripped out ._.
Mark after this can you finish Oneshot? PLEASE
I'm not the only one that feels this game is rushed and unfinished right? Like even if you don't get everything 100% this game feels like it misses alot of stuff like, why was that one room on fire? What the hell are the disappearances, heck of alot of stuff are buggy and this game somehow doesn't feel fnafy y'know? I don't know if it was hard for Scott to make this game because it's different than what he's done before, or because of the things that happened to him
Jank is strong with this one.
he will find us not like freddy did him.
#3 on trending for gaming! 😱
Alot of people commenting on this talk alot about how mark would keep going to recharge stations and not go to the exit without having played the game.  a) the game can bug going to the lobby, where moonman will instantly kill you if you go to the lobby exit, forcing you to exit thru the docks or just hope for good rng. b) after you upgrade freddy if he runs out of power its instant death, so it makes sense why mark would recharge freddy. c) vanessa telling you to go to the main stage is only supposed to happen AFTER the 6am choice to collect hidden CD's. The dialogue appearing before is a bug. d) mark wouldnt instantly remember the way since you only go to that lobby entrance in the first 30 min of the game, so its running around hoping to remember because you dont have time to check the map with the timer.  people defend this game alot saying "mark isnt listening or reading" but you know what could fix that? a map marker of a quest, like almost every open world game has.
Are you sirious siri sirious siiiiirious siri sirious
"#1 on trending for gaming" as it should be. 😌
do all the princess quest games for the best ending and uhh gl finding the other ones lmfao
Mark, there's actually 6 ending to this game and you have to see all of them and put them together, to understand the true, actual ending of Security Breach
"Freddy....FREDDY....FREDDAYYYYYYY"
As a brand new game I expected bugs, but holy hell the AI is completely broken.
Vanny is connected to glitch trap she’s orchestrating everything because glitch trap can’t physically
No spoilers or anything, but play the Vanny ending again.
Intentional or not ^^;; you have to admit that now the possibility of Freddy not appearing conveniently next to you, and possibly not show for you at all, does add another element of tension/horror. Your Freddeus ex machina has just run past you in your time of need. The game has succeeded in freaking you out and making you scream for Freddy, which is crazy in itself. ^^ Markiplier, sorry for the terror, and I'm sorry I was laughing at your screaming the whole time. Final note: Mark, sweetie cakes, XD you really need to read things more.
I LOVE U MARK THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS IS AMAZING
Hey mark. The no save feature after the ending is bullshit. So ill give you a tip. If you pick up the driver assist head from roxys raceway you ll be able to save again.
I like how mark kept trying to get into a charging station even though the game kept telling him the charging stations are offline
Mark, if you go back to the theater theres a hidden room, and its hidden behind a foxy poster(Sun/moons room) with a prize bag,
“Freddy you BITCH “🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 oh god that brought me in tears 🤣🤣🤣
FREDDYYYYYYYYY!!!
28:00 - 29:18 certified 2021 big brain ai moment
Freddy: *dies* Mark: *Feels sad*  *10 minutes later*  Mark: *FREDDY U BASTARD!!!!*
Freddy: waits in stairs for Monty to go  Markiplier: Dies
Mark, Freddy is always summoned to the coordinates where you press the summon command. If you always move away from that spot he will obviously never reach you. Sumon Freddy, hide and wait till he arrives, bro.
Love this part lol 14:28
"This is the slow way" -Mark Slow
this series made me realize that mark just misses *everything* : buttons, doors, VERY OBVIOUS buttons and so much more
The idea for a comic style for all of the endings is a good idea, but i feel like it also came out of nowhere maybe if there was other segments throughout with comic pannels??
That ending with mark screaming at Freddy made Christmas Eve so much more fun 🤣
"There are links in the description that I know you haven't clicked on" I feel called out and I'mma piss myself, help... I know Mark's a real sweet dude but I never feel as threatened and scared with a YouTuber as I am with him.
Yeah this game sucks
theres a door in the roxy raceway that leads to an elevator shaft which you need both chica and monty upgrades to get to, what does the elevator go to
merry Christmas everyone
Finally fnaf is back the fnaf arc was the best in my life
I feel so bad for Mark trying to be professional about this game… thank you for your efforts, sir
I know you said you were done with this game but i really want to see you play the Afton ending
u didnt get the real ending, there is one that has no comic books just an animation
Mark- screaming to freddy for protection while being chased by Monty Monty- Hey, little guy. Freddy- Afternoon Sir Mark- FREDDY ! Monty- Hey, little guy Freddy- Patiently waits his turn. MARK- FRRREEEDDDDDDYYY!!! MONTY- HEy LiTTlE gUY.
Freddy: these eyes are amazing so many things I never knew existed, so where did you get them.  Gregory: lemme think, uhm hmmmmmmmm I think?? Uhmmmmm hmmmmmmm uhhhhhhhhh hmm lemme check hmmmm uhmmmm
Okay the moment at 28:45 killed me XD
NOOO FREDDY DIED NOOOOO FREDDY YOU'RE MY SUPERSTAR!
well at least he knows thats not the true ending
So we all agree the game was overhyped and turned put unfinished
Merry Christmas mark
This game needed to be delayed a month more
Good news! Its almost a *c@ck* ! Omg freddy getting lost is amazing XD
20:18 Ghost Freddy unlocked
Maybe Because of Roxy's eyes,that thing got damage by a racecar, so Freddy Got enhance poor eyesight.
Man I can see why so many fans are disappointed by this game. This game was clearly rushed in development.  -Glitches galore -Unused locations for story purposes -Low budget endings  What happened with this game's development?
You need go monty golf
I don't remember how to get the true end but it's underground
18:08 (wheeze)
That "trying to call Freddy but pass him* I might just animated because is so Funny!
Man i like u

Mark is so busy skipping past things to get to the next bit he misses the important parts he needs to pay attention to.  Also, his screems of frustration at the end sounded like he was going to hurt something, almost.

Duuuuudeeee, Mark spouting them wisdoms: "Vanny is just a Red(-eyed) *hare* ing" XD

There's a bunch of endings for this game.  I think one is linked to the princess arcade game.
cool cool yeah but did you know the link has "bruh" in it
Anyone else miss those silent  Markiplier - Freddy elevator moments?
28:42 Freddy: hey pa- nope.
the cinematic tension as soon as monty appeared
28:50 FREDDY JUST RAN AWAY HE WAS LIKE "WASSUP MAN" TO MONTY AND THEN RAN I CANT
Freddy running past him and Monty is so fucking funny to me
I think the save stations are active if you choose to stay
I think Mark is right about It playing differently they even took out seemingly story related voice lines like the one with Monty in the trailer he had a pretty cool voiceline but now It has been took out and seemingly they just didnt want to push It back more
the suffering mark felt there damn, i can feel it too
I really hate youtube with the random pause making it show the thumbnail everytime it kinda refreshes the whole thing making it inconvinient especially when the thumbnail is scary
Freddy: So Gregory Are you Going to stay or leave? Gregory: Vanny. Freddy: 👁👄👁
Watching Freddy go zooming past, while mark is in a complete frenzy is just absolutely money.🤣🤣🤣 I
Come on is can't be the end! 🤭
I feel like Scott will be updating the game more cause isn’t there like a level 10 security door that wasn’t meant to be opened by Freddy
What he needs to do : 1 min gameplay  What he does : 10 min in video in reality propably 30 min
Is he goun to do more eps?
I find myself weirdly drawing parallels between FNAFs "digital Afton saga" and parts of Danganronpa XD 1) Hilariously copious and gratuitous amounts of murdered children. 2) Cutesy, often murderous robo-animals (Now I picture one of the robos going "Puhuhuhuhuhuuu" :P ) 3) PLAN JUNKO-FY THE WHOLE WORLD!!! (overwrite peoples minds with Junko/Afton through murdering them in a VR game and then taking their bodies) 4) Ending narrated in comic/manga strips, which I actually find really charming :D (also, anyone remember the old-ass Bionicle comics? That's what that style reminded me of :P )
27:52 is where the chase begin
me balling my eyes out after “you’re my superstar” and mark just letting out a tea kettle laugh
I waited all night for this video lol
Yo if they would animate the Part where Vanny gets killed, the game would be 18+
This is just my opinion on the gameplay:  When it comes to security breach it feels like they put more effort into the details than the actual basic things like gor instance how mark got to the first cutscene ending but nothing explained how he got there. He just teleported to fazzerblast without any explanation. Other examples are the way the animatronic chase you and how they frequently get stuck, but on the other side we have like i said beautiful cutscenes many places to explore and alot of hidden lore. it just feels like that’s all they did though. I’m not saying the game is bad but there are many things they could’ve easily been fixed and given the player a better gameplay. These things were however overlooked.
If anyone cant shit just put on marks security breach gameplays and the shit will come right out if ur scared enough
this game mid 😂😂😂
Markiplier, after you’re done with security breach you should play In Sound Mind, definitely didn’t get enough attention from youtubers, it seemed like it was gonna blow up and everyone would play it, but that sure didn’t happen,
The whole second half of this video was literally nothing. You didnt resolve anything. The rest of the series was so good. Then you has this whole second half of nothing being resolved
I love how Mark accidentally got the secret Vanny ending without trying.
What the fuck was this game
Everything literally pointing to the exits  Mark: Nooooooooooooooooooo
Marks intro got me drying of laughter right in the beginning of the video
freddy goes to your last called location so running while spamming summon does nothing lol
NOOOOOOOOOO MY DAD
I actually cried 👍
Why 😐😐😐😐😐😐
Freddy said nope not today mark
FREDDY!!!!!!!
Freddy: "Gregory, you can either leave, or stay" Gregory: *"vanny"* Freddy: what? Gregory: *vanny*
All the sparkles are a bit distracting. Is it part of the game or did Mark’s editor decide to be all fancy since it’s almost Christmas
someone should put a mic outside the door or in a next room for a "no context video"
If you enter freddy while jumping you enter yhe void
Enjoy your suffering? No...   I CRAVE IT😋
pov you liked the video becauze mark was screaming ''FREDYYYYY''
mark there is a way to save after you get to stay if you go to the roxy's raceway where you get to pick up a STAFF head it will turn time to 5:15 keeping the progress that you have but also unlocking the ability to save again
mark you still have to demolish monty....
shoot freddy with the fazerblast alot
YOU ARE STILL THE KING OF FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDYS!!!!!!
Freddy runs to the point where you called him, not to your watch! That's why he keeps running right by you!
Mark not going to the Freddy recharge station to get rid of the moon effect
There is a secret ending I dont want to give spoilers
The fuck was that "vanny" option ending lmfao, like 0 to  1000000
hey Mark is #1 on trending for gaming rn
"The recharging stations will no longer protect you"  Mark: *If I can't hear you, you don't exist*
28:02 "Freddddyyyyy!!!"
me crying when freddy dies mark: *laughing and say: ,,did they run out of buget?''* me: *starts laughing*
Merry Christmas to mar kiplier
The intro pls— why did I watch this at the asscrack of dawn then had to rewatch it to find out the intro wasn’t me having a fever dream
Glam Freddy: You… are my superstar…. Everyone: *uncontrollable sobbing and weeping* Mark: *aggressive confused wheezing*
How many times did mark have mini heart attack?
“FREDDY YOU BITCH!” Mark said calmly
His high pitched screaming made everything even better than it already was
Damn that Vanny ending was RUSHED
I doubt you'll see this, but I thought you'd like to know I splurged on a CLOAK shirt from your "Life After Death" line and saved it until after I had my chest surgery in February and was healed up from it, making it the first shirt I ever wore that didn't touch my boobs or a binder. It means a lot to me for that reason.
I do feel bad for Markiplier. You can clearly tell he isn't completely enjoying this game. And I can't blame him this game has so many issues.
I was just watching episode six, and before it had fully finished, I clicked on this one. Immediately got greeted by Mark going "What are you doing here? You're early." and got shook for a moment
You should try to blast the cardboard animatronics I wanna see if it does something
everyone when freddy dies:😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  mark:*HAHAHHAHAHAHAAAHAHA* did they run out of budget for the animation?
Its not that we like seeing you suffer its that you are a masochist and we know it so we want to to go true the pain to make you happy
Fnaf: Liminal Spaces
Is this really the end of the game?? I am so confused.. so so confused. The entire game feels so unfinished and bugged unfortunately.
The game definitely needs some debugging lol
28:50 made me laugh so hard, like "fuck this I'm out of here"
Freddy just passing Gregory on the stairs had me in hysterics. He bolted up past him with such determination.
27:51 i literally jumped out of mu bed
When Freddy completely passed him up on those steps 😂
Everyone knew it you deserve a crown of FNAF because YOU ARE KING..... OF FIVE NIGHTS AT FTEDDY'S!!!!
Mark so so apparently there is a bug that allows you to save...so u need to re-collect the 'useless mr.hippo magnet' and boom! you can save...i think its fair due to how many bugs youve come across so it evens out
Mark got 1 of 8 endings....him reading this comment Markiplier:oh cool, but y so many!!!
Wow... the Vanny ending is, garbage lol.
Mark, for the best ending escape via the docks!!!!!!!!
I really hope mark does one last part to get a better ending !!
Watching the mental decay of a YouTuber ^^"
The Vanny ending almost made me cry like  really
help im dying laughing and laughing dying and help
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from Indonesia
Is this a documentary about the slowly deterioration of the human mind?
I loved 5NF but can u bring back Inscryption pls
You can't save after a point? Wtf is this BS man....  They need to patch that. Horrible decision.
Merry Christmas Mark!!
Merry christmas everyone!
7 diffrent endings you got one of the bad ones
if you went to the exit it you finish the game
28:40 LEGIT THE FUNNIEST THING IVE EVER SEEN BYE
these make my day so much better
complete the questttt
freddy: you are.. my superstar...  me actually crying
There is still more you just have to keep looking Not everthing is as it seems there is more thine one ending see if you can get them all and there is more thine 3 endings..
I died when he was calling Freddy and Freddy just whizzes past him🤣🤣
Please don't forget to flag bots when you see one. Reporting anomalies will make your and YouTube's staff life easier.
Mark was right that there's a lot to this game than just this, but as like any other game that was developed during the pandemic this game was rushed and running out of budget  I got info from someone, that the developer spends too much time making the environment that they forget they also have a story line to make, so when the environment is done, they run out of budget for the actual story and gameplay  This game were actually set to be released on 2022 (idk what month) but then they rushed the game coz they slowly run out of budget and doesn't want to abandon the game  Hence why the story is weirdly connected and why the Vanny ending is just a animated comic strip  I mean Monty and Chica were supposed to have a rich personality and characteristics like Roxy, but then again budget issues
F in chat to pay respects for Freddy
28:15 - 29:17 This entire section is pure gold 😂
Madness-plier after Markiplier lost his sanity after the Laundry maze and Derp Freddy
17:55  Game: Tries to be wholesome  Mark: W H E E Z E
"We are friends Mark" Freddy last words
Mark there is more endings try to get them all and u missed montys boss
It's truly painful watching Mark call Freddy to twenty thousand different locations and getting mad at Freddy T.T
Here's to hoping Mark goes through all the endings. ...if he can keep his sanity that long that is...
27:50 onwards is my f absolute favourite! I don’t think I have laughed so much in my life! 😂
You know Mark, I guess this Vanny option wouldn't be so bad if you have managed to find and beat those Princess Quest arcades. This is definitely an obvious hint, since Vanny's lair has an arcade machine.  But you know, I'm just sayin'...
glamrock freddy just keeps giving me "confused optimus prime" vibes.
I think you have to rescue Vanny
17:40
I definitely agree with Mark at 25:00, it feels like the game really excels at atmosphere and even character personality, but the story itself seems really lackluster... Freddy and Gregory talk like really close friends at the end even though they didn't really have any bonding moments. There's a lot they never explained, like why are the animatronics sentient? Why don't they explain more about why Freddy is the good guy? It just feels like there are too many holes and not enough substance there. Which is a damn shame, because I love the atmosphere, and the little details (like Roxy crying in front of the mirror) really made it seem like they worked really hard but started to rush things in the end. Here's hoping for a lot of answers :)
Other players: *Go up the stage and the normal, easy way out*  Mark: *Goes the longest way possible going back to the start and replaying the whole first section*
mark cmon there was a button on the stage
Youtube desubscribed me from mark bruh
* sees the little caution guy* Mark: uh hi.
"You are my Superstar"  That gave me MASSIVE Iron Giant vibes 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
bro i legit nearly started crying at the Vanny ending xd
15:19
I love Mark but I can't be the only one who gets mad when he constantly spammed the Freddy button WHILE sprinting and then blamed it on Freddy for actually going where Mark told him to go...
i think Vanessa is vanny because when you see vanny her outfit is seamless and more humanlike so would "disassemble vanny" be ripping apart a human body?
i think the reason why freddy passed you when you needed him was because you called him a lot meaning he would go to previous call points before he got to you
My favourite part of this is Mark slowly losing his mind getting jumpscared by moon relentlessly
Day 3: Will you play the new dlc for oxygen not included?
“Head to the exit”  Mark: I’m gonna pretend I didn’t hear that
FREDDIE RUNNING PAST HIM SENT ME PLEASE THAT WAS THE FUNNIEST THING IVE EVER SEEN
We had the death of Charles. Now, we experience the death of Freddy. Emotional deaths in video games. Movies don't have jack on them.
28:41 I've laughed soooooo hard!!! 😂😂😂
“The charging stations will no longer protect you” Mark: “I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear that”🖤🖤🖤
28:41 top 10 anime betrayal
I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD CHRISTMAS MARK ! :D
Mark, it's not Freddy's fault. He pathfinds to the location where you pinged him. So if you ping him and then run away, he's going to go to that spot
18:10 I think Mark is disappointed
Help with the saving issues. I know he’s probably already recorded the next episode or not going to read this but. Mark when you get to the point where you can no longer save try picking up the robot head again, the one you just used on Roxys race way. That should help you, hopefully it will let you save again.
Pizzaplexploration?
These videos are the highlight of my day :))
they really should've waited to release this. there's so many cool ideas and moments in the game but overall it lacks so much. the game is broken and buggy, the story is not well executed, major plot points are skipped over or were scrapped, the ai is poorly designed, vanny is not well developed, and the mechanics aren't enjoyable. it's honestly so disappointing
There is a door with a “restricted access” sign to the back-left corner of Roxy Raceway, which leads to a path to an old elevator you can only access with Chica’s voicebox and Monty’s claws.
Ain't no DAMN reason they had to make Vanny thicc like that.
❤❤💯❤❤💯❤❤💯❤❤💯❤❤
Hint:you need to check the arcade games it will unlock another ending
FREDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
It seems that Mark had completely forgotten that he can HIDE
Mark: keeps complaining about how he doesnt understand  Also Mark: makes 0 effort to pay attention to any ounce of detail
This game could've been fantastic, the concepts are excellent but the execution is poor. They just needed more time.
Omg stop trying to break and also leave freddy 🤣
28:42
The only 3 star ending is the Princess quest one
"...Feels like something went wrong in development..." Yea. "Something". Like Scott Cawthman retiring because of life threats to his family due him executing his rites to vote and support  his candidate.
When mark was being chased by Monty and trying to get freddy was so freaking scary but yet hilarious!!
What you need to do is get months class and go to the stairs where you found the message where it said something is draining power down there and I’ll leave the rest for you to do I’m not spoiling it but if you ask me what the ——- is down there I will tell you
28:42 this made laugh so hard
Are...are there no jumpscares? Or am I too early for the list?
They really found a way to save budget...
I think the Vanny stage thing is either glitched or it was cut but the dialogue wasn’t cut
Honestly a lot of marks Game over came from him spasm around too much and not looking properly  Also your tantrum throwing isn't funny it's obnoxious.
28:42
you need to go down into the mines and play princess quest 2 to unlock a actual night which gets true ending but you need to do stay #
The lore is so loreful
They’re are 6 endings  The one that needs all the upgrades requires you to go to roxy raceway after getting all upgrades
Mark makes this game 1000 times funnier!
13:54 "Freddy, if i leave now there will be more disappearances" am I the only one who thinks that the game said nothing about any disappearances? I feel like the story is good, but there is so much that just isn't talked about at all. i still dont  know why gregory was here, why the animatronics are trying to kill him, who vanessa is, who vanny is, why did the build on trash, why are there animatronics that can literally accidentally crush a child if they step on them. It just doesn't make sense at all.
So basically what I got from looking at posts, some if the game was cut due to timing and them having a smaller than normal team. They basically didn’t have the time nor man power for the bugs and other part of content. Though they stated that after they resolved bugs they will be working on completing content. So thats what had happened if anyone was curious.
Freddy stomping around trying to find him while Mark screams "FREDDY!" In the highest voice ever had me in tears 🤣
There are a lot of endings in this game, Mark.  Like 7 if I recall.  Edit: Also the Princess Quest is a mini-game.
You won’t find me lol
محتواك جميل من 2015
i really hope they add a dlc or future update that gives us extra quests and upgrades for our items/ freddy. maybe even a way to customize freddy with different eyes for different abilities etc
someone NEEDS to animate the ending with Gregory as Mark.
Did Mark never learn that Freddy goes to where you pinged him rather than to you? Rather than screaming "Freddy you bastard!" try "Mark you dumbass!"  Why would I click your shitty links?
Hey mark i know this doesnt have anything to do with the game your playing but i just wanted to say you should check out a game called "Heavenly bodies". Its a space game where you are in a space station doing all kinds of space stuff. I think you would really enjoy it
Yes, Mark. We love your suffering. My ringtone is a scream compilation of when you played "getting over it".
I find it funny how Freddy never comes when make spams the button, so he proceeds to spam it more.
Everybody hates those spamming bots that hates markiplier, but noone realizes that writing anything to them is useless. Just report them and ignore it. Its no use to be raging about them.
You can't be done Mark.. There's too much lore.. THINK OF THE LORE!!! LORE MARK!! TOO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS!!! THE LORE!!!!
Well shit how disappointing for mark hahaha
Did y’all see the theory of Gregory being an animatronic too…. It’s insane… but it makes sense
WHEN DID I MISS 6???!!!
Hi Mark, :)   I know you won't ever see this comment - 18k comments after all! - but I had a thought that if you get to this might help make the game less frustrating for you?  OK - so from where I'm sat (back seat driver, so apologies for this!); I think the biggest problem here beside some big bugs, is that your playing the game more like Halo (sprinting, charging, going loud and proud and attempting to use speed/firepower to escape peril), and perhaps you should attempt to play it more like Metal Gear Solid or Thief (slow, silent, sneaky, and using observation to avoid danger)?  For example - you have the cameras on your map you can use to plot out where the staff bots move so you could in theory avoid them by timing your movement into the party rooms so you can avoid detection, instead of sprinting past them and hoping to blast whatever anamatronic is chasing you with the blaster - which as we know doesnt work on Monty.  Also - since your stamina bar is low for this kind of thing (I reckon again its game design here rather than bug or the like) I reckon the idea is to use short bursts of speed to get between hiding places - not a marathon sprinting from one giant segment to another without pause.   Again - at the end where it says there are no saves; this for me is the game telling you that all your stealth practice so far will now be tested to reach the ending. As putting yourself in danger by moving fast or relying on Freddie to shield you is constantly causing you to get caught and have to restart. Maybe instead of using Freddie as a walking Fortress on a short timer, you could use the environment to hide and use Freddie as the emergency shelter if things become too dicey?   Just my 2 pence worth - I hope your going to continue as this game looks alot of fun and I've always enjoyed your fnaf stuff!
FREDDY 😭
When Freddy ran past mark and he started yelling I was laughing so hard omg
Freddy works the same way as before, freddy goes to exactly the spot you called him so when you run around he goes where you where and not where you are
FREDDY! GET YOUR MECHANICAL METAL ASS OVER HERE! FFS!
My fav parts :33 17:45 NOOUUU I CRIED THEREE😭😭😭  28:17 I imagine Gregory screaming like that XD  30:15  Yeah than we can play FNAF games :D   Thx again for playing MARKEPLIER!🤗❤
The Freddy recall button appears to be less "Come to me" and more "Come to this spot where I pushed the button".  So, Mark mashing the recall button while he runs is just leaving a trail of points behind him that Freddy's gotta check out first.
21:24
Mark you could save in so many spots so you dont have to go back so far. I was screaming to save lol
Mark jabbering on about areas not being utilized, but doesn't realise he has to go to the theatre to shatter monty
I never got a bot reply to my comment, so if u mind lmao
If you pick up the robot head of the robot assist driver you can save again. Its on the location where you found it first.
28:43 *Markiplier just got Duped by Freddy*
This game was not properly tested, this is awful game design. How can you tell yourself "yeah and so, if the player dies here, he will have to do this whooooole sequence again. I'm sure he will be "aha, oh you got me, let's do all of that again""
I mean the FNAF lore was hard to follow already, but this game is beyond ridiculous…
28:42 had me dying lmao.
lets be honest. the game is a pile of shit, a through and through brand name money grab
“I will find you” he says me in my head: unlike Freddy
The game feel pretty cheap... don't know why but i feel there could have  been more to create in the game...
Vanny kinda thicc tho-
So Mark, something I noticed about Freddy Summons, even before the patch to fix the game. He will always go to where you summoned him, not where you actually are after you move. So if you summon him while running, he will just go to your summoning location, so plan accordingly, setup the summons in a way you can circle back, in case you have to run from enemies.
Monty:"Hey, little guy!" Mark:"FREDDYYYYYYYYY, FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYY"
13:41 okay Will Graham
28:41 is the hardest I've laughed at any of these videos, the "YOU BITCH!!!" killed me! 🤣🤣🤣
FREDDY!!!!!!
I think the issue is that Freddy runs to your exact pinpoint location when you call him. So, by running around and spamming the call button, you're screwing up his pathfinding by repeatedly telling him to come to where you are--except he can only really go to where you were. It would explain why he seems to run right past you so often; he's going to the precise coordinates you called him from.
Remember that there is something under the pizza plex that is draining power. I wanna see you find that mystery
Mark I think that ending was a comic because they didn't want to animate those bots ripping Vanny apart...kinda would make it M rated. Or AO
Find all the princess quest games for a ending for vanny
Mark's gonna lose his voice screaming like that one of these days.
Expectations were probably set too high for this game on all accounts; both external and internal. They built up more than they could afford to, and the resulting story is choppy and far less than memorable. Pretty much the same issue that infected the MCU.
30:15 please find me, i'm a thicc fan if yours😂😂
Markiplier your just going into 5o much detail its not that complicated the game just wasn't made very well becuase its made by the company now not the real maker
What bummer endings
Mark if you want a good ending Complete all the 3 prinses Arcade thing
The game is unfinished af.
Mark: *laughing at Freddy dying*  Me: *cry*
28:35
What Mark has forgotten, he always comes back
Mark: FREDDY! I NEED YOU!   Glamrock Freddy: **runs pass Mark**   Mark: *FREDDY, YOU BETCH!*
27:40 does anybody of you remember this?? Its the background on what we play before idk the exact name but i think it was some sort of (all in one?) We often play "jakal, or Contra".  They use that reference hahahahahha
It’s comforting when Freddy says superstar🥲
Mark: FREDDYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!  Freddy: runs straight past him despite the fact he has new and better eyes
Game literally gives Mark a new mission right before Moon got him, and he won't do that again.  Freddy may realize how Georgy got these upgrades from friends and left Georgy to die! lmao
I wanna see what happens if he leaves
Am I the only one who thought thought comic made sense-? Like we all know that vanny isn't an actual animatronic. So for them to animate the bots "disassembling" vanny would have been horrific, even for a fnaf game. I'm sorry if 5iu dknt agree with me, but for me the comic cut scenes made the most sense lol
Good luck finding me  Merry Christmas
Its actually kind of an interesting thing they've done here. Animatronics at this stage in the game especially with your little eye zap gun aren't really a threat anymore. But since you can't save... Now all of the sudden where any screw up can mean losing ALOT of progress it stays tense in that sense
Freddy said that he found a party pass and gave it to you
best moments in this game yet
Slightly unrelated, but has no one noticed how just randomly musty and dusty freddy got?? Lmao
Vanny feels like a last-minute addition to the game, there aren’t many things happening with her character, and it’s painfully obvious who Vanny is after the first few times you see her.
sooo a part 8 yes?
There are multiple endings Mark
27:57 to 30:00 was the best part for me I was dying of laughing 😂😂
I decided to watch this vid 10 mins before xmas…. So merry xmas mark!
28:43 true pain
this game feels like its not sure what its going for. like its lost all identity from the other games, but not in a way that works. i couldnt help but laugh with mark at the comic page ending, like what? haha comparing this to the horror of the other games where they werent literally holding your hand through every grueling task and story, it looks so silly. if the whole game was like the DJ sequence, it wouldve been so amazing, seriously.
*TURN! OFF! YOUR FLASHLIGHT! WHEN! GETTING! CHASED!*
There is a secret in bonnie bowl that you can see with Freddy only!
“Alright see you on the other side I guess” *pain*
Mark is slowly descending into madness each episode and I am all here for it
28:25 Freddy is driving him crazy LOL
They didn’t show the last scene for size and also bec vanny is a human that gets literally torn limb for limb by those bots from the sewers
The people behind this game very clearly have no clue how to design an intuitive open world experience. Everything about it was sooo confusing
Do it all ends pls I guess there is a secret end too
Of course the first option Mark ends up choosing is fucking murder.
The way Freddy just runs past him was the funniest thing, I literally couldn’t stop laughing.
Gregory: **ping!** Freddie: Gregory needs me! I'm coming Gregory! Gregory: **ping!** Freddie: Not now Gregory, I have to find Gregory!  Gregory: **ping!** Freddie: I'll be with you in a minute Gregory, right now I'm looking for Gregory, then I have to help Gregory!  Gregory: **ping!** **ping!** Freddie: Gregory, where did you go?! Gregory and Gregory, you'll have to wait, right now I need to save Gregory, then I have to find Gregory!  Gregory: **dies**
i noticed freddy always goes to the last spot you called for him from before he goes onto the next spot that you pinged. so spamming for him to come to you might actually be slowing him down a lot
Mark every time he calls over Freddy: oooh I hope that's Freddy
28:42 i burst out laughing on this one lmao💀💀💀
I feel like the Monty bit was kinda deserved at the end.
Mark: FREDDYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!! Freddy walking down stairs nice and slow with Monty like good pals
28:43 "you can see it in his face it was rough"
FREDDEEEEYYY
“get me in you, i can’t see a god damn thing” MARK?
I love Doğukan Adal
Mark I dare you to get the canon ending because apparently it's very hard, you need to do everything at one go without dying I've heard.
I can just imagine Amy having friends over and all they can hear is Mark screaming for Freddie to save him.
I'm crying, I'm literally crying
Glamrock Freddy: You wanna stay?  Gregory: *V A N N Y*  Glamrock Freddy: Gregory, what? What are you saying?  Gregory: *V A N N Y*
Who thought disabling saving is a good idea? This game is so badddddd
PLEASE DO THE TRUE ENDING
Freddy not helping Mark was payback for him dissing his death. 😂
Someone needs to make an animation of freddy screwing mark over at the last part that was so funny
They ran out of budget at last animation XD LMAO
by far the best moment in this video is when freddy runs past a crying, shaking, screaming mark as monty chases him down the stairs lol
mark: walks up to the charging station. also mark: are you serious? are you serious? are you serious, are you really serious?
If you play and beat princess quest 1 in Roxy’s town place then choose stay and play and beat princess quest 2, you go to the exit and choose vanny and instead of pressing the button, you play princess quest 3 then you will get an ending Please like this so he can see, I don’t care about likes but it annoyed me when he didn’t remember the princess quests
Jesus mark you seem so jaded. You alright?
I gotta say, that Vanny ending was pretty disappointing
Throughout this whole game I was letting pass the lack of budget and flaws because it still managed to be interesting but legit just using the STORYBOARD ART FOR THE ENDING SEQUENCE???!
Freddy giving the ultimate bar tail 😭😭
Can't wait till someone animate this of Monty chasing mark trying to call Freddy just pass right by him🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
(here is fun fackt) he olvais come Back
I have a feeling Mark will enjoy destroying Monty in the next episode
"FREDDY, WHERE ARE YOU?!" Freddy: "Never gonna give, never gonna give..."
Oh god I damn near woke my roommate. Watching this at 3 AM and Mark is just screaming in utter betrayal at Freddy... I've never tried to hold back uncontrollable laughter this hard in my life.
Mishan 🅥 Should shut up He is a Fooool with his evil bots
Day 1 of waiting for another food review
There's a secret ending.
7:40 Springlock fail
Mark, we felt the betrayal. We love you. We also love the character development that Freddy went through. However, we will always laugh at Freddy's twisted sense of humor "Superstar" 😂. Breathe, and give yourself a break and time to rest!
Vanessas gift is a CD one of multiple that give mor backstory about her. It was lying on the ground you blind bafoon
Mark must be enjoying the five nights at Freddys teet he's milking
i still think mark said vanny is a hair
They did not play-test the game at all really (probably), they were rushed by the fans alot, so they probably did not want more of a delay, BUT Steel wool said that they are gonna fix the bugs pretty soon on a forum post.
Mark! No spoilers but after getting Monty's Claws go Roxy's Raceway again...
29:16 your fault, dont spam q like a maniac :D .. he will always go to the first point he was called and only after arriving there he will approach the next call point and so on
When are we getting the horror compilation for dis
When he was yelling FREDDYYYYYYYY then screaming FREDDDY had me dying 😂
Mark if you see this comment please react to FNAF VHS tapes for a try not to get scared challenge also it’s really hard
You should look for Bonnie with Freddy trust me
mark: imma get to charging station game in ep 6: all charging stations are closed
28:42 Is best scene 🙃🙃🤣🤣🤣
Mark: *FREDDY*  Freddy: Where are you
The Monty chase was soooo good 😂😂😂 I also teared up a bit when Freddy said Gregory was his superstar, meanwhile Mark laughing and saying did they run out of budget for the ending 😂
Oh I can't wait until he makes a compilation. I was bursting with laughter when he ditched Gregory.
markiplier please do not show us when die alot on sommething
Mark yelling at Freddy as he spams the damn button. X.x
What happened to the king of five nights at freddy's?
Oh, once mighty King of FNAF how your knowledge of the games has fallen. Even though the game was put in different hands Steelfish made sure to follow the ways of Scott by keeping the game about choices. To keep things simple... you haven't even scratched the surface of the surface. :)
Mark:FREDDY! WHERE ARE YOU! Freddy:I AM HERE WAIT FOR ME Goes betwen Mark Mark's head :YOU DUMB ASS FREDDY!
When mark was just screaming “FREDDY” when monty was chasing him made my day 😂
RIP Freddy he a real one
It's almost a.... WHAT!?
The way freddy just sprinted passed him on the stairs had me crying
MY DAD NO
it's like they had a fully rendered map and some cutscenes and slapped a story over it
woohooo
Its so nice to see mark back on fnaf
Finish the Princess Quest 1, 2 and 3 to get the other Vanny ending, Mark!
Freddy:  *runs past Mark as he screams for him* Also Freddy: Comedy
I like how Mark's biggest enemy isn't the animatronics, but the sense of direction of the pizzaplex. Even with the map, Mark has a hard time navigating to the right direction due to the complexity structure of the place
There is a "True Ending" which you need 2 stars and to go down the old elevator to unlock (Mark already has 2 stars).
Can't wait to see him finding all the endings!
mark: there is more Game: princess games anyone???
"FREDDYYYYYYYYYY, FREDDYYY YOU B*TCH" 28:42
“What happened“ -Markiplier 2021
Find me markiplier, i havent clicked the links
Go powch the buten
jesus there's so many fucking bots in the comments
so to summarize marks playthrough: not listening to explanations not listening to objectives not evading the security bots poor pathfinding.  PEAK ENTERTAINMENT!
Get the monggo claw
In the Vanny ending, play the arcade machine if you can. There should be a new ending  Edit: for more detail the arcade machine is in her office
❤Thanks markiplier ❤
wait he uploaded?? is this the last episode? :(
ARE YOU KIDDING I KNEW EXACTLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF HE CLICKED VANNY I DIDNT NEED TO SEE THAT AGAIN IM SOBBING
I Hope he does the Afton Ending
Mark I’m sorry but all of your speculation is fruitless, all the stuff you didn’t see or do was on the monty golf route instead of the fazer blast route
Top 10 Anime Betrayals at 28:42
I love this series and i love this game, i love a lot to see u playing and screaming, please do more
there are 7 endings in this game, good luck :)
29:51 was make Freddy a complete idiot
Start from 8:00 min thank me later
Mark: FREDDY HELP Freddy: Im sorry super star but my super star needs me
0:05 WELP, guess we know what's the secret unlockable upgrade for Freddy.
“good news, it is almost a cOck.”
You know whats better? there's a "bruh" in the link
"Did they run out of budget for the final animation"
I never thought I’d see the day a man notorious for his fnaf streams to ask Freddy for help
11:18 honey, the mission said recharging stations are now offline and cant protect u  :D
Hey Mark , there are multible endings like : the best ending you get with playing all three princes wuest game, and one that you get by entering a stange hole in the goround , i think that hole is somewhere by the foxy raceway
told you u need to play pricees quest for the good ending or you couldve stayed and find something in the basement (;
Mark: Alright Freddy, I need you here   Glamrock Freddy: **gets lost immediately**
MISHAN’S CONTENT IS GARBAGE!  MARKIPLIERS IS WAY BETTER!   :p
28:41 When your classmates see Cheetos
When is the next playthrough? I'm getting too many spoilers pls erase my memory
Are you going to make more or are you done with this series? 😫  I'm really enjoying this one...
i can’t believe how bugged this game is lol
7:30 the most confused jumpscare of this playthrough.
I noticed Freddy goes EXACTLY to where you call him FIRST. Knowing this made watching Mark constantly call Freedy whilst running very painful.
FREDDY NOOOOO
THANK YOU!
Hey Mark! This is not meant to spoil anything but to make you aware that there are 6 endings, one of which is of course the True Ending. You should definitely keep playing around with it. A little warning, they're all of varying difficulty to reach so good luck and have fun!
28:41 Freddy just running past him after all that screaming 😂😭
7:27 here we go
YOUR GAMMA
battery recharge station: *right next to the save point in parts and services* Mark: “I need a flashlight spot”  also game: “recharge stations are closed in the last hour” Mark: “why can’t I use it?”
I was wheezing at Freddy's dead scene B r u h
Apparently there are 6 endings
Clearly the way pinging Freddy works is that he goes to the location you pinged him and constantly pinging him just causes him to reroute making it nigh impossible to go in the suit
انا عراقي من النجف واللة وال قرآن
I laughed so hard at the  (FREDDYYYYYYYYYYY,FREDDYYYYYYYY) part that I almost peed myself😂It was just so good🤣
There are maybe 5 more different endings
Marki there’s different endings like good and bad endings :0 I hope u get them though
Freddy is a gamer
Oh my lord, Mark haah  28:30
There's multiple ending to this game Mark.
I will say Scott did a great job making the characters and scene are amazing but the narrative you follow and the scripted scenes leave much to be desired.
literally his screams of bloody terror and anger when freddy just literally does an anime betrayal RIGHT in front of him and bolts upstairs is legitimately funny to me. also, he is the FNAF king after all. so he will probs push his way thru the game and do all the endings and lose his sanity because of it lol. mark, u are number 1.
Mark today: "I am DONE!" Mark tomorrow: "hello everybody, my name is Markiplier and welcome back to five nights at Freddie's: security breach."
It does matter because you fail to know how to get rid of moon in time
The way the robots beat freddy I cant 💀
Lol the end was HILAriOus
yet again a game that wasn't finished, god i hate that this is the new norm and we accept it
Not if i find you first
Remember the cringe fnaf songs                ...Long time ago
Get the Monty claws after you choose to stay, and go explore some areas that had those fences Infront of them, also there is somewhere the possibility to find higher security clearance, which you will need to explore!  As for the endings, there is one ending right at the exit where you where, by just leaving (bad ending)  One ending in the loading docs (needs security level 7)  One ending at the fire exit in the Atrium (needs all the *Golden* Plushys, one of them in a secret room in the daycare theater)  One ending is at Roxy raceway when you remember the logs saying something about "something drawing power from below"....  And one ending, you need to find the Princess Quest arcade (first one I don't know, second one if where you got chased by music Man at the end), you need to find them both, and then go to the exit, since you need to choose the Vanny Option, in order to get access to her room to get to the last princess quest arcade!
FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYY YOUUUUU BASSTARDDDDDDDDDDDDD i cant im laughing too much haha
I was literally WAITING for another episode of this after watching number 6 and as soon as I go to bed HE POSTS IT AHHHHH but I’m so happy it’s here now I’m gonna watch it now
Rip Freddy 15:04 and realy rip Freddy 17:45
You're not really done, are you ? You're close to getting the true ending, would be a shame to end here :(
What happened in the game was Scott Cawthon and his family got a bunch of death threats for his political opinion so he had to stop development.
I hope he doesn't drop Inscription
The vanny ending is perhaps the worst handled video game ending I have ever seen
You see, at the end, when Freddy ignored Mark, he just wanted to say hello to his friend.
Afton boss fight
the way vanessa said “you deserve a reward, go check the main stage” got me fiending 😫
Basically what it comes down to is. They needed a budget increase and another half a year to polish it or even an entire year to finish development. Just looking at how rushed the endings are says a lot about how much time they had to develop them compared to the rest of the game. I don't know if it was the development team mismanaging their time or if it was corporate shoving a three month release date in front of them when they were halfway finished or something, but. Something obviously went wrong.
YESYESYEYSEYSYEYEYEYEYDYEYEYDYRYRYEYRYRYRYRYRYR
I’m sure that you get to go to different parts of the complex depending on wether you choose to get the camera as opposed to the blaster
Remember the sinkhole they mentioned in Roxy raceway
AS OF RN THIS VIDEO IS #1 ON TRENDING IN GAMING LESS GOOO
Damn, freddy calling Gregory his super star actually hits kinda hard
29:18 he said “Freddy you bastard!”
‌
*Mark:* _"So the ending where Gregory just leaves is the right choice!"_  *The ending where Gregory just leaves:* _(is the worst possible ending you can get in this game.)_
Just like william afton.... fnaf always comes back... I also wonder... will vanny like return like william?
Mark wheezing in confusion is the funniest thing I've ever seen
Him: FREDDY (while forgetting the fact he has a gun.)
Dis si a bed end
You have to play the princess arcade game to get the full ending thing & saving Vannesa/Vanny
No you wont find me
The Ending was hilarious 😂
In 28:44 he said “FREDDY! YOU BITCH!”
Honestly was sorta hooked with this game, just because of the whole free roaming thing. But man, the bugs are just ✨
Ohhh no you gave them so much power sooo much power you gave them  T H E      M E M E you helped the TRoLs
The in animated ending has to be the greatest disappointment ever lmaooo
Welp, can't wait to see Vanny "content" appearing on the Internet
Holy macaroni cloak is so expensize to me.. even tho they look so gosh darn comfy. Im glad for ppl who can afford it ;3
28:4
btw the ”true ending” is involving the princess quest arcade
Himbo Freddy
when marks says are you serious it makes me think of YOU CLOSE YOU CLOSE
Of course the first ending he gets is the one where Gregory commits a murder
ok mark .. see you in part 8 :D
I liked the game, for me the best game in the franchise, yes it has a lot of bugs and glitches but it's not the end of the franchise, it's still entertaining, many people  forget that there are updates patches, I also hope they fix the bugs and glitches.
Mark ffs Freddy goes to the first location you call for him, so he’s just going to ignore you to get there
Anyone else just completely lose it when he started screaming Freddie?? Hahaha
So much happened too fast in that "Vanny" ending, honestly it felt like total rushed garbage.  Oh I'm at the laser thing, oh now Freddy is dead I can literally see parts flying everywhere there's no way he can't be- wait no he's still alive, oh now instead of a cutscene there's a weird looking comic, oh now Vanny is dead, Oh now Freddy is actually dead, Oh there are the credits.. It can't just be me who thought this was a joke I mean come on..
FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYY U BASTARD
i anm upset.
Never in my life did I think a day would come when Mark would call Freddy so desperately for help
The true ending doesnt say anything
vanessa asking you to come to the main stage for a reward i think is AFTER you choose to stay
The way Freddy ran past Mark while Monty was chasing him😂😂😂
Mark there are like 3 or 4 endings
freddy speeding past him after screaming hecking sent me
I really Hope Mark doesn't give Up hope for this game
Freddy seems to come to the exact location you were in when you pinged him, rather than right to Gregory, regardless if you meet him on his path to the ping location.
I really wanted to see the leave option
Hi Markie 👋 you are the best youtuber and probably the best Mark. Lol
This game feels like watching Rise of Skywalker.    There are huge unexplained jumps, saying rather than showing, and even though I know there are more endings...it feels empty and almost like a grab at "Hey, we're FNAF/StarWars/Marvel so you must like us.  Right?  You don't wanna make OTHER FANS hate you, right?"
this game is so broken
No don't yell at himbo puppy Freddy 😭
See you in Part 8 I guess...
Sir you missed the button on the main stage  Press it  Do it
This game just oozes with potential but it also just seems so disappointingly unfinished. I hope somewhere down the line all the cut content gets added in.
watching Mark scream desperately for Freddy as he runs past him and Monty was quite the highlight of this video
I didn't click the link. Come find me, Mark. If you dare >:D
I was asleep when this was uploaded ;-;
Theory: Monty used to be the golfing mascot only. Some incident occurred with Bonnie, they made Monty the bassist against his will, hence anger issues and him sneaking off to the golf course. Same for Roxy at the raceway. Incident happened with Foxy, and she had to replace him, leading to her constant worry she'll screw up. Similarly, Chica is scared of being replaced and eats due to anxiety. I wonder if Bonnie and Foxy are still around somewhere, like in the garbage maze.  (I copied this from someone and i don't remember who it was)
I wheezed so hard when Mark said they ran out of budget
Pls Markiplier do all endings pls there are 6 of them plsssss
i just spilt tea all over my laptop and fucked it up omfg
Funny thing I think mark was supposed to go to the exit stay then go over to the stage to talk to Vanessa
Vanessa:go to the main stage I got a reward for you ;)  Gregory:ok  “Almost get raped by moon
Everyone in those credits did a subpar job. I mean FNAF never had a straightforward or even GOOD story line. Imo it should have ended after four or three. But they REALLY dropped the ball on this one, at least it looks nice.
MARK CALLING FOR FREDDY AND HE JUST RUNS PAST HIM FUCKKK IM LAUGHING SO HARD
Mark, I never click on the links in your description, so please come find me lmao
if only he knew he was one arcade machine away from the true ending...
i litteraly just watched the other parts of this and then this realeased
This is legitimately the most fuck game of all time. This game fucking sucks. Fuck. Fuck this stupid fucking game.
Please go back to Inscryption when you're done with Security Breach. I am loving watching you play both of these games!
Play Minecraft now
He sounds like a malfunctioning robot at the end credits of vanny
Freddy waiting his turn going down the stairs after Monty is the funniest shit I've seen in awhile. 😂
Mark: WHERE AM I???? Me: please im begging you there's a map
love how the freddy just ditched him in the end
The ending of this game is so lackluster it's kinda sad...
fanf at feddy
They really did run out of budget on all the endings haha
ya ever count how many times mark says freddy?
28:40 Absolutely lost it here 😂  "FREDDY!! FREDDY, YOU BITCH!"
Not gonna lie this could all have been avoided if Gregory just said to moon hey sorry I had a nightmare can we go back to sleep and just slept in  daycare centre
i don't even see the point of patching the game unless it's unplayable if their really stopping pep from speedruning the game by using gltiches what's the point they all ready bought it who cares how it's played
Everyone when they are seeing the sad ending:😭😭😭 Markiplier:😂😂😂
FREDDDDAYYYYYY
The way freddy betrayed him lmaooooo
why is monty legit so fucking terrifying oh my god
Ok but I laughed so hard I almost peed myself. Wonderful.
*Freddy dies* Mark: did they run out of budget for the last animation? 💀😂😂
*cough* PRINCESS QUEST *cough* *cough*
Mark: "THAT BROKE HIM ENTIRELY!"  Also Mark: "lemme just spam the call button. Huh? Freddy will stop at every ping location first? Nah. He's gonna see me and stop there right?......right-"
Oh? How can you find me when… *Insert VPN sponsor here.*
When Freddy betrays you
...so what happens if you just leave?
Wow, all I need to do to get a free visit from Markiplier himself is to not click the links in the description :o
The yelling Freddy constantly has me laughing. It also gave me anxiety xD this is why i dont play this game.
is this the end of the series? please noooooooooooooo
FREDDY
The Thumbnail background of the video never gets old Including mark
HIII MARK!! I'm one of your fan :D and I luv ALL OF YOUR VIDEOS!! And PLSSSSS DO ME A FAV BY JUST PLAYING "Your turn to die" I REALLY WANTED YOU TO PLAY THAT GAME! I hope you noticed my comment!!
Mark: *calls Freddie at point A* Freddy: *starts moving to point A* Monty: "Hey there!" Mark: *panicked screaming, running and spam Freddy calling* Freddy: *going to every place Mark pinged in order* Mark: "FREDDY YOU B*TCH!!! WHERE ARE YOU GOING!?!?!?" Freddy: *sad robo-bear-dad noises*
There is more to this, This seems like your typical "base" game, create the world, set the stage, tell a story. Then add to it later with "expansions" that tell different stories, create new time lines, connect dots from different POVs. The world of FNAF is now open, and this was only night 1.
You can't blame Freddy when you don't pay attention to patrolling staff bots.
you were ment to take out monty before you destroyed anyone else
i think you should play Chivalry 2 again it was fun to watch you play it 5 months ago and its grown the past months so ya i would love to see you play it again
Part8?
Freddy: *dies* Mark: W H E E E E Z Z E
Why isn’t there a jumpscare at the end
10:42 is the only time I’ve actually jumped at one of the jumpscares in this game
man the bug in this game is real
There 6 endings all together and they have star ratings as to how difficult they are to access
Mark listen this game has a multiple endings so maybe another episode with other endings
18:02 Anyone else just laughing to death by hearing this?
Merry Christmas everyone ☺🎄
This was wild, the "ending" of the game was so sudden and realy dark. And marks reaction to the comic was awsome
MARK Y U DIS WAY? UR TEARING US APART, LISA!
im pretty sure mark has memory loss seeming as he was told that the recharge stations are shut off
BROO LETS GO
Mark is so bad at games these days 😂😂
Vanny do be lookin' kinda thicc tho
14:31 It's scary how accurate Markiplier impersonated Freddy.
You can still save the game with a bug by getting another broken robot head in the roxy raceway
Merry Christmas Mark! That's the perfect time for finding me, since we have lots of cookies and what nots.
And the true ending has better animation 😂 it’s also satisfying
Mark, I have come to remind you that you have not finished amnesia rebirth. I know you here was a bug, but you can load a previous save. Please finish the game mark. Thank you my friend.
this game could have been actually good if it had more time to bake and wasn't rushed out the door with no budget left
Great video! And merry christmas!
looks like the moon from henry stickman is back for blood
Marki-player of fnaf 7
The beginning rlly caught me off guard and I felt confusled💀🐓
2nd on trending gaming
The Monty chase scene was funny enough as it is with Mark trying his best to escape him, but then you hear Freddy coming only for him to run right past him, and you can see the joy instantly fade from his eyes and be replaced by pure betrayal.  "FREDDY YOU BITCH! FREDDAYYYYY!" When I tell you I almost died laughing–
True ending: u have to fully upgrade Freddy and go to the Roxy raceway go to the elevator, use it and brace yourself for some fun and a nice visit from an old friend 😌
Freddy: ah yes forgot my protection  Markiplier: FREDDDY FREDDY FUCK THE PROTECTION GET OVER HERE AND HELP ME OUT FREDDDY!!
That's one out of some ending...how many again
I think Mark forgot the recharge stations are out of order now.
3:34 7:28 10:45 12:23 27:53 28:26 29:14
There's a secrete ending where spring trap shows up and Bonnie and foxy.
Just relized he’s kept the same outro for how many years now crazy
What about the whole "Aftons office" with springtrap in this game? I don't think we saw it in this play through so I think there is more content to be uncovered
You can still save. If you get the drivers head again from box. There’s also six ending. There’s one more exit remember at the loading dock.
I think that the reason for the cartoon comic strip ending wasn't because of a budget issue but rather that it wasn't the canon ending. Not the true ending. Just the possible ending as a result from either missing too much of the misc. items you might find, maybe even the princess games the mention could be playable just like in the other games where arcade cabinet games were available. But especially since Monty still had his hands and claws. Though earlier,  didn't he have the option of going after essentially Monty or Chica and he ended up taking on Chica, gaining her voice box? Freddy didn't use it to stun the bots. Might have mauled them though. Either way.
"did they run out of budget for the last animation" damn dude, didn't need to roast them like that 🤣
There is actually a collectible at the main stage...  The Roxy name shirt This is why Vanessa tells you to go to the main stage
Game outosaves when playing arcade games
I just got my new phone for crimuh, this is my fist comment on YouTube with this new phone. I absolutely love this series (even tho you couldn't give a fuck about this comment, lmao)
If you happen to see this would you try pressing leave on your auto save at 6? The doors are closed I wonder if the game will be weird
This game is so bad
Mark you dense fuck. You literally upgraded Freddy to be able to stun bots with Chika’s beak. I love this dude but the day he actually remembers or checks even a single message or instruction in a game Hell will freeze over
it’s like 3 am for me imma try to watch this lmao i was out all day shopping with my dad so yea :))
IT'S CHRISTMAS JUST A DAY AWAY GUYS JUST A DAY AWAY
Dear Mark, I hope you read this. (If anyone could help reach this to him it will save Mark so much pain.)  There is indeed more to this than meets the eye, and I am not going to give any spoilers. Instead, I offer a glitchy, helping hand.  If you head to Roxy Raceway after choosing to stay, head back to where you find the Driving Assistant's head. Once you see it, collect it, and the time will say "5:15AM".  Do not be alarmed, as all your progress will be fine. In fact, with this, you can now save and not worry about a complete restart.  Good luck, friend.
7:25 Mark gets ripped off edit: not for the only time rip
14:30 further proves that Freddy sounds like Mark 🔫
Ah! I thought mark was laughing at freddy and vanny dying but when he said that "did they run out of budget for the last animation!?" Is when i started laughing too i really did think that mark was a big sadist im sorry ahahahaahahahahaha
Mark, go to the old elevator :D (true ending)
Mark: FREDDDYYY!!   Freddy: I think I heard something... Monty: it's probably nothing. Freddy: yeah your right.
Mark, you can't find me. I'm from Romania.
THR ENDING HAS ME IN TEARS
If you’re that desperate for the actual ending, Mark, find the Princess Quest arcade cabinets
Marks reaction to that Vanny ending is the funniest sh*t ever XD
Does anyone know if any of the endings or other lore will explain more on who Vanny is, her significance, why she’s there, and what she wants? I’d love to know
Is it just me or does it seem like Freddy runs to the exact point Markiplier calls him at.
This game was not completed before release, and it's _REALLY_ obvious.
I thought the Vanny ending was moving.
Mark continues game Me still crying over freddy
Pretty sure the issue with calling Freddy is just that he comes to the spot where you called him and if you catch him halfway to that point, he won't stop even if you're right next to him.
28:44 😂
How angry do you have to make mark to make him actually clip his mic, not even getting over it could do that
What happened what happened what happened what happened what happened
You NEED to play the secret ending
I am watching this when it is 1# trending for gaming
Me every time I see Freddy run towards mark. “Help is on the way dear!!”
freddy's pathfinding is err... a bit beyond abysmal.
The game has so many areas, I dunno about anyone else but it kinda feels like the base game is setting up for DLC's. The whole game is essentially a single night right?
Dude wait, is the game 6 hours long start to end? If you count up the minutes in Markiplier's videos and convert them to hours, it is roughly 5.5 hours, but there are also cuts in his videos taking out some gameplay (and Mark has some dialogue where he pauses the videos to talk about what is going on). I think the game is real time 🤔
The first time i see you
mark: did they run out of budget for animation?  well… probably not… she’s just not an animatronic… so it would’ve been gory 💀
Mark there are multiple endings to the game
This game is... so bad... it hurts... I'm sorry I'm just writing my opinion here, and feel free to disagree (although I won't come back here to argue with anyone), but this game is way too buggy and just seems incomplete overall. I'm not a professional, but I am a game design student and I know enough to say that it's not only tech problems, it has so many design flaws as well. Idk I'm just disappointed and glad I didn't spend money on it
Freddy be like: “On Your Left.”
Im sad you went for one of the bad endings. Vanny is not responsible for herself.
Mark when you choose the option to stay, try going into the Fazcade again, go to the dance floor and you'll get a surprise!
Mark, as much as i like fnaf sb, i wanna see inscryption part 6
I was waiting until 6am for this video AAA finally it was uploaded when i was asleep lmao
Markiplier at the end: “I’m going to come find you, I’m going to come find you” Me: Sister location reference?
There is essentially two routes or maybe even three in the game that sends you exploring in different areas. Thats why you havent seen every area of the megaplex. If you choose monty golf instead of fazerblast you get monty chasing you through the theater and you get an option to get his upgrade so you have all three at the end of the game. You can also in the very beggining choose to take the route up and around the megaplex, which you did or down and around the basement areas.
The one time you can feel sorry for Freddy
Mark is correct. This game has polished "Scott Cawthon" stuff that is exactly like the quality we've seen in the franchise and then there is stuff that was removed or makes no sense, so many sequence breaks, bugs, etc. which is the result of all the idiots that ruined the franchise and forced Scott away from his property because of their political bullshit.
You should go back with freddy and do the mission venessa gives you on the main stage just stay in freddy maybe moon wont kill you
There is a true ending but it is endgame mode meaning that if u die u have to do everything all over again you had to use the party pass at monty golf
I truly TRULY wish this game was better.
There are different endings and Easter eggs in the game hope you find them all!
Markiplier:*goes trough staff tunnel* Not markiplier:*just goes to the exit trough the main hall*
At around 7:30 the time got to 6 o’clock and you were still faffing about in the restaurant, Mark. You need to attempt to leave before doing anything else in the pizzaplex. I’m sure he figured it out later in the video, but I’m just yelling at the screen rn
Freddy comes to where you clicked the clock and once he starts moving, he's going to that point no matter what. So if you keep moving, he'll never reach you. Mark not realising this may be the funniest shit.
Can you give English subtitles because I can't hear English well? Mark pls pin this comment if you see it Because I'm Vietnamese, English is not my first language and I've only been learning English for 3 years
The moon is the scariest thing in the game for me and I don’t know why
I think the issue with freddy is that he comes to the exact spot you summon him from, not just to gregory when he sees him. So if you summon him in one area and then move, he continues to go past you to the original area you summoned him to. Which would be why he runs past you so often, he's heading to the spot you summoned him to, not to YOU the player.
The patch fixed a bug to get to fazer blast way before intended
Definitely not the first time he’s said “FREDDY YOU BASTARD” but definitely the angriest he’s been while saying it
Lmao Freddy gets folded by security bots
Mark there is loads of endings and you have to do a bunch of things to get them
Mark: Yells at Freddy for not saving him from Monty Also Mark: runs straight into the fucking Security bots TO summon Monty.
Pretty sure what happened is that they updated it so where freddy comes to the last place you pressed the summon button. That may be why he passed you and went back to the direction you where running from Monty.
mark LOVED freddy untill 29:14 happened
the ultimate betrayal tho respect freddy for it
29:00 pov you just turned off the kitchen lights
plot twist: vanny is just vanessa's fursona and she is very anxious about anyone finding out so once you spot her she has a little mentally unstable moment and decides on the spot she'll kill a child to hide the reality of her being a furry
dude just figured out the entire Afton ending
Am I the only one who finds Vanessa’s “you deserve a reward” monologue was oddly sultry
This is one of 6 endings... I would like to see you do all of them but its hard and you will suffer a lot like a lot...
I'm wish the best for your sanity Mark.
chile am I the only one that cried when freddy died :')
I really hope they fixed Roxy
Didnt anyone notice that when glamrock was about to be dissasembled, wasn’t his hands like montys hands?
some of us have headphones Mark...
Why does Markiplier have no emotion at all?
Not me getting teary eyed of Freddy essentially dying and his last words before going offline is your my superstar 😭
You will not be the King of FNAF if you don't you unlock every ending here. Good luck))))
Freddy goes to where you call for him not where you are so if you run away or go somewhere else he wont be there
Boring
nooooooooo, why did you choose vanny that's a worst ending
i didnt click on the links, so come find me
Personally, I think they just focused a lot on the amount of details and different gameplays (running around, upgrading, the laser game, the DJ, the different animatronics mechanisism, ...) but was a bit much and could not take the time and money to test and prevent some specific events that could have occured when roaming around the facility between chapters/objectives. Which give a much more linear playthrough but in return much more polished animations and gameplay, despite the bugs on the way.  Also, porting a game on a console take a lot of time and in general, only AAA studios does port their games on multiple consoles.  Nevertheless, I love Cyberpunk 2077 and, despite the bugs, this game has really great potential and really cool ideas that would seem unbelieveble from an independant developper or team of independant developpers. And in the end, I just hope that they're still motivated to keep making game, with the hope of improving on the next ones.
Fun fact of Vanny ending is actually exclusive to Markiplier.
If you press vany you can go to the arcade and live the button
Here are multiple endings, Mark...   Will you be trying to get them all??  Great playthrough, even if it was abit all over the place at times. Lol
The Vanny ending is exclusive to Markiplier.
Hey Mark don't give up you still need to face Springtrap
I'm gonna be honest- I didn't think I'd enjoy Security Breach as much as I actually did lmao I hope Mark tries for the different endings and finds out what the collectibles are all about. 🤔
"Im done"? What do u mean u r done? U R MARKIPLIER!! THE KING OF FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDIES!!! If theres more, and there is ALOT more, u never quit.    Side note: I'm playing here. I know he just means hes done with the episode..... i hope
The way Freddy kept betraying Mark was too hilarious lmao
holy shit this game is horrible! no wonder the videos are getting shorter and shorter
I honestly expected that Freddy would realise Gregory screwed over the bots and stole their parts on purpose and he would go nuts after receiving the eyes and whatnot. You'd end up running from Freddy as twist enemy. Honestly, in my opinion, it would have made more sense to have Freddy as an enemy as per usual, but I do enjoy the character of Freddy in this.   Honestly the game sets up a lot of plotlines with very little in terms of answers. I'm wondering if there will be another security breach sorta of thing and this is sort of Gregory prequel bs.
Don't Do That 🤣 30:13
Freddy running straight past Markiplier when he needed him most kills me
Mark: "Calls for Freddy" Freddy: Sike Mark: FREDDY!!!
By the way: in Vanny's room is also this videogame, that you can play to get another ending.
Game: recharging stations are offline  Mark: but what if they still work
Mark sounded so scared and pissed off all at the same time. 🤣
Seeing the ending now, this game seems as hobbled together as the Pizzaplex itself.
It was the 2 star ending because you choose vanny
I hope he knows that theres 3 more endings...
28:42 funniest shit ever.
Find me just like Freddy (doesn't) find you
that game is so cringe in all ways possible... what happened to the franchise so it's that particular way... why i just forced it through to be done with lore, and for something to be on background, but it was a somewhat painful experience. I miss true horrors of previous games Mark's comments save it from being completely obnoxious, but still the game is a parody on the whole fnaf fandom, which is a weird continuation in general
Will you be finishing inscription
Sorry I mean the channel you made we’re only lasted a year do you Remember that?
this game sucks lol
there is also the three princess arcade machines  to find
Hey Markiplier do you number Unis Annas
yes in  the true ending you have to fight burn trap in the fnaf 6 pizzaria and to get it you need to stay and find a secret elevater that can only be rid once
Actually the funniest moment in the game when Mark is chased by Monty and Freddy goes shopping in the meantime.
Mark idk if they patched it yet or not. But I believe if you go to Roxy's Raceway where you find the Extra STAFF head bot, I believe recollecting it somehow gives you the ability to save again. (Idk how) and you should fire your fazerblaster at the STAFF bot's eyes. It will stun them too. Also you get something nice if you stun the STAFF bot that was on-stage.
I adore the game, I really do. That said, like a lot of people are saying it feels that the story is incomplete. There is so, so much that we don’t get answers to, at least not without finding and seeing all of the endings and getting all of the collectibles. I feel that the game needs more thought in revealing what’s actually going on with the story. A lot of it is seen through the collectible messages and everything, but I think that they relied TOO much on relaying story through said collectibles.   Gregory is a perfect example of this. They set it up so nicely to have something cool done with him; him hiding in Freddy, staying in the pizzaplex, being hunted by Vanny even beyond the walls of the pizzaplex, Vanessa outright saying that they can’t find any record of him… it all seems to be pretty incoherent, and the cool set-ups where they could’ve done something is wasted. And being the character we PLAY as, there’s absolutely no reason that we don’t know more about him. Not to mention, missing kids aren’t mentioned anywhere in the game until the very end, which is really weird. I feel like the developers thought they were making Gregory out to be too much of a villain and had to tack something on to make him feel like a protagonist. Because at the end of the day, Gregory is NOT made out to be a good person until that point; he destroys the animatronics despite them not actually trying to kill him, despite Freddy pleading that they are his friends, and after he does he lies to Freddy. This is another thing that feels really glossed over and almost intentionally ignored for the sake of easy plot continuation.   The Vanessa/Vanny connection also feels very glossed over. This one is revealed more through the collectibles, but it is hardly even mentioned in the gameplay itself. We just get a sort of “That similarity in the names can’t be a coincidence” before it’s immediately dropped, never brought up again by the characters. Being one of the most important and interesting characters in the game, it feels that the game itself should highlight it more and give it more prevalence than “Vanny is chasing you! Escape her!” type situations.   Additionally, I think it’s horrifying that despite only being able to accomplish less than half of the story before the 6:00 mark you can’t save upon staying to see the rest of the game. Don’t get me wrong, this adds stakes and is very cool, BUT it shouldn’t be utilized in a way that robs the player of story. I’ve watched more than one person play through the game, and I’ve seen more than one outright robbed of a good ending just because they died once after staying. I think that this feature could be used for getting collectibles, as these aren’t such a huge part of the game, but when it comes to revealing more than half of the story of the game it’s pretty ridiculous. We saw firsthand here that Mark was robbed of defeating Monty because he died after progressing so far after staying.   Like Mark mentioned as well, the fact that comic strips are suddenly utilized instead of the cinematic cut scenes is so JARRING. There’s no transition from cut scene to comic strip and because of this the endings lose so much power. For example, we see this in Mark’s reaction to the ending he got with Vanny. Whereas the “You’re my superstar” line is supposed to be impactful and powerful, it just… isn’t, because it snaps from cinematic to comic strip. The player finds themselves taken aback by the sudden shift to the point where the ending itself is hard to enjoy. While I think comic strips can be utilized in games and be cool, this game does not feel like one of those games. The whole game is packed with rich environments, pretty graphics and lighting, and gorgeous cut scenes that really do make me want to watch them more than once, and to contrast these in their entirely with a comic strip (and a brightly-colored one at that) just doesn’t feel right at all.  That said, the game also does some things REALLY well. Animatronic movement (save for the security and janitor bots that move at a noticeably lower frame rate for some reason) in the game is GORGEOUS and done so well. The animatronic designs are amazing as well, and I adore the variety we see especially in characters like DJ Music Man and Sun/Moondrop. The detail in Monty’s tail specifically is so nice, and seeing an animatronic with hair (as well as being able to see how the tail specifically works after Roxy is burned) is also very cool. The environmental detail is immaculate, with so many details placed around that the player will likely miss or gloss over. In specific, the big room with all of the memories from the older FNAF games is SUCH a cool experience and is a great way to incorporate the old with the new. The Bonnie paper plate doll in the kitchen of Bonnie Bowl is also a cool example of this.   It’s a great game with so much promise overall, but it feels so… unfinished, even now. I truly hope they work on this over time, as I’d love to see a game like this reach its full potential.   If you read my essay, thank you! I know it’s a lot to read and I’m commenting it knowing that the likelihood of people actually reading it is super low. Not sure why, but I felt compelled to put these thoughts into words and post them.  Edit: Thank you so much for replying with your own opinions! I wrote this essay to share my own opinion, and seeing all of the responses with similar or different opinions is really great! Everything I mentioned here is absolutely open for discussion, so please feel free to discuss with me
Vanessa: check out the main stage Markiplier: YOU ARE LYING! me: that button on the stage is pretty sus
From the looks of it the way Freddy seems to be coming to you at this point. They seem to have programmed his pathfinding to essentially follow your steps. Like when you summoned him before he went into the Freddy room, the room you were in. So when you summon him it seems like he basically follows your entire previous path to get to you. At least that’s what it looks like.
The level design is amazing, which amazes me at the many issues with bugs, considering how simple the game is (all things considered)
Freddy: Good News it is almost a cock Ow gets me every time
That intro got me laughing xD
Omg that last, montey chase scene was so good! 😆
o snap
Mark in his outro: i will find you  Me: Im not mad, at least i get to meet him
I would like to make the argument that the hardest boss that Mark has faced throughout Security Breach is not in fact any of the animatronics or the sun/moon guy. The hardest boss that Mark seems to face is the fact that he can’t seem to fing where he’s going (ex: the washing machine/laundry hell exit or the fazerblast arena). The map is really freacking complex, so I don’t blame him for getting turned around. But besides getting turned around, he’s really good at figuring out how to not get places. Throughly enjoying every bit of this series.
i honestly cant' get over the fact that freddy RAN PAST gregory, MADE ROOM for monty on the stairs and was going for a snack at the bar before he tried to go back to mark AND waited his turn on the stairs 10/10 best friend ever.
Mark, can you do a video when you chose Monty instead of fazbear?
There are multiple endings. I would LOVE seeing you do all of the endings. One of them includes Springy boy.
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation?"
click leave and see what achievement you get and what it says
TRENDING
I mean there are more endings that NEED to be seen and played, especially with mark’s emotions and reactions
All I want for Christmas is this series to show me the real ending
If you want to regain the ability to save go and get the damaged head you needed for roxy raceway
So I was curious about how many endings this game actually has and I decided to look it up thinking that there was only 3-4 endings. People there is SIX ENDINGS 😳😳
me having seen all the endings this is like watching a three-year-old trying to do something you already told them how edit:I think he got a glitch that allows him to stay in Freddy forever lol
there is a other vanny
Mark, staying mean that you'll had to deal hardcore mode with tons of hours and no save points. If your down, then back to square one on hour 6.
I started to cry SO bad When freddy said ” you are my superstar”
bruh i dont get notifications
Nice
I just had a different ending, and it is so BAD! They really just rush you into it by suddenly changing into a comic with zero voice acting or animation? That's so terrible :(
Reminder to ignore bots. Commenting or anything gives them too much attention. Just report and move on.
29:00 I love how Freddy is running after him ! 😂😂
I feel like a good 50% of Mark's issues with this game is caused by him either not listening or not reading.
I cant believe I cried over a fnaf game why did he have to say you are my superstar 🙂
Freddy: "you are..my superstar"  TELL ME I WASNT THE ONLY ONE WHO CRIED PLS
maybe that vannesa voiceline you heard in the elevator was meant for after deciding to stay, try going after the decision. the reason i think that is that she says "do you know what time it is, the doors are open, why are you still here..."
What I think about the game. I’m only saying this because mark was sharing his opinions and I believe I can come to a conclusion about what he was trying to say. based off of my watching of the letsplays, and my observations of what others are saying.  I believe the consensus is that visually, the game is beautiful. The graphics, the structure of the map, the art, the cutscenes, all had a lot of effort put into them, and it shows beautifully.   But on gameplay it’s uhm... not the best. Not just in the masses of glitches and bugs, but also in pacing and story. People seem to agree that there were indeed at least a couple parts that were really good! The pacing felt nice, it was engaging, the visuals remained top notch, and people understood at least the gist of what was happening. But in between those points was... lacking. Someone from reddit was talking about something along the lines of “the glue holding those cutscenes together wasn’t that great”. It sounds to me like a lot of uneven pacing (which might’ve been made worse with a path that wasn’t exactly defined...), and that the points between the engagement just felt unfinished and dissatisfying and lacking.   And then there’s the ending. I’m gonna be honest- I missed the point where it happens, not paying attention lol- but I heard many people talking about the endings feeling rushed and slapped together and confusing. And I did tune back in to Mark’s intense confusion as the credits rolled, and from what I’ve heard, I can’t say I’m too surprised. And then Mark saying that there was *no way* that was possibly “the real” ending... it just gave off “this ending is very unsatisfactory” vibes. I wouldn’t be surprised if that’s what went through his mind, with all the concerns I’ve heard.   But I can show off why I think the game is the way it is. Steel Wool was founded by “Pixar Veterans” as they call themselves. That already sets something off. They were used to making movies, not games. But hey, people can still learn new things... right? Well uhm... a look at the companies LinkedIn shows their current roster of 49 people, including a lot of CEOs (co-founders), Executives, and higher ups. Out of those 49 people, we have only 4 people on development, and 4 people on QA (Quality Assurance)... 8 people on gameplay... out of 49... about 1/6 of the team. Now, what about the rest of the team?? Packed full of animators, digital designers, graphics people, riggers, it’s like you’re making a movie!   That alone shows a lot on where they put their efforts, but, I don’t think it was this team’s weird portions that messed with it... I have friends in IT and I’ve heard that it’s a bit too common for Developers and QA to get neglected. Especially QA. I’ve heard that the typical occurrence is a time squash, where QA comes last in line, and not given enough time for a proper test (if tested at all), leading to a uh- not great result. All of this, on 4 testers. It doesn’t surprise me at all given all the bugs. It’s also common for the *devs* to have to test too- great for bare bones basic function... but uhm- that’s all they’ll test because that’s what they coded. It’s harder to think outside the box when you literally made that box- that’s why QA people are super important.   There’s also arguments going around talking about “this is why public testers are important!” First off, there may be something you want to see in my reply. Second off true. Releasing a beta demo to a small randomised crowd can definitely help spot some interesting bugs!! But that’s also what QA is supposed to simulate. That’s literally what they are *paid* to do! They are supposed to go into the game (almost) blind to simulate your average joe playing the game. They also run multiple tests to simulate your different types of joe too!   My point is, from observation, this game doesn’t even feel tested. I’m pretty sure it wasn’t. What I’m getting from others is that this looks like a shiny shell of a game... and that’s sad...  Anyway I’ve rambled enough. If you’re interested for something more, the TEA if you will, then feel free to look at that reply.   Otherwise, hope you’re having a lovely day/night/life 💖
There might be a way to get security lvl 10. Found a few random security offices that were off the beaten path. Maybe answers are behind those lvl 10 doors
Hai!! I love your Videos they are awesome just like you!!!
The part when Mark was running away from Monty. And when Freddy finally gets the he's just like "oh, Monty! Yeah, I'm outta here."
Ah yes. The game isnt finished.
"FREDDAAAAYAYYYYYY"  - Mark 2021 -2022
Didnt Freddy tell Mark during the last episode that the Recharge Stations are shut off?? Lol
Aren’t there like 6 endings 👁👄👁
Yo, go up to bonnies bowling place in freddy bro
Mark: pick ME UP FREDDY   Freddy: I'm gonna pretend i didn't see that  Monty: i will administer a control shock  Ps: fuck the bots and the guy in the comments who said "I MADE A VIDEO ABOUT MARK'S NIECE GOING TO HELL" yeah fuck you oh and if a bot says in my comments "My content is way better"   First step in convincing me for that is   Go to bed  Lay down  And keep dreaming
Glad there is someone else who is seeing the problems with the story and not jut gushing and immediately saying it's the best game ever just cause it's Five Nights.  Even after watching Dawko play everything through, there are still a ton of unanswered questions and set ups that have no follow through.  Lackluster "boss fights", confusing story with many things being used once than forgotten about the rest of the game,  very quick, almost jarring pacing, absolutely zero explanation of who the kid Gregory is, how we got there, why Vanny wants him so bad, why the animatronics are targeting him, why Freddy isn't, and little to nothing from Vanny herself against Gregory until end game, which even than only appears in three of those disappointing comic strip endings most of which aren't even canon, why does the security guard want to find him, why does she rather threateningly tell him to check the stage when there is apparently nothing there, even the extra area with the extra boss is very lackluster.  I had expected a lot more encounters or boss battle type situations with Vanny and the animatronics, and a much better story.  The story itself is almost non-existent, with nobody questioning anything at all and focusing solely on getting Gregory out until it was time for him to get out.  This honestly almost feels like a fan game with references and easter eggs that the more in depth lore fans would really understand.
mark is built like monty
maybe for this series only I'll excuse hearing the use of my dn once
It feels like half the staff was working on the story and the other half designed the world and they never communicated.
Freddy continuously charging in the wrong direction every time Mark calls him is sending me. 🤣🤣
28:41 I died laughing 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Freddy goes to where here you called him and does not go to where you are when he arrives.
Find the 2 Princess Quest arcade games and play them before going to Vanny's hideout and play the 3rd and you will get an ending. From my very low detail research, this will likely result in the Secret ending so I think it should be the last one.
Find me, Markimoo!
idk if freddy is bugged or spamming tje freddy button is just messing him up
This feels..... Odd... But for some reason.... The story and its endings.... Don't make any sense.... At all... They way they laid out the game, it feels like a lot of the game's main story was gutted and cut. I watched all the endings and secrets that have been discovered... But it feels incomplete. It feels like there should have been a much bigger game.... Hell there's evidence of cut content in the game in it's trailers.... Full of cutscenes, and dialogue. The fact that despite not knowing vanny's name until you get the fazblaster (which is an optional item in the game, its not needed to get any of the endings) but then saying her full name at the end when you are given the choice to stay or leave. Ontop of that.... Vanny, the main antagonist is only scene a handful of times, and cutscene and lore wise is almost non existent..... Plus the missing children..... No where in the game is it mentioned that they're are any missing children, besides the bad ending, and again the choice....story wise the game makes no sense....
28:43 Freddy be like : "Nah, I'm out, pal, take care"
I know everyone's mad about how low budget the endings seem, but I think they did it so we wouldn't get confused about which one was the true ending.
I hope Mark plays this to completion, because...needs...
I suggest reading some of the messages you’ve gotten throughout the game to find out what to do once you’ve decommissioned monty
Never thought I'd hear Markipler say "Freddy! Put me inside you!"
Mark , try to go to vanny's hideout and play princess quest 3
I love how freddy legit ran right by him and all the way up the stairs LOL
MARK YOU HAVE TO STOP SPAMMING Q FREDDY TRACKS YOUR PINGS NOT YOUR CURRENT LOCATION ASFKHLASDFHLSK
Even if I listen to Distractable and have been to cloak multiple times (looking forward to my hoodie coming next year). Can Mark still come find me lol
There sure is.... A lot to this game. Like underneath the pizzaplex with the endos, Bonnie's bowling alley where you were sent to grab one thing, and a whole Fazbear theater with next to nothing in it. So many great things that are on their own, but add nothing to the story. It feels as if the devs wanted something more but was rushed just so the game came out earlier; not to mention Scott retiring half way through. I think that's why the endings feel so void and not so cinematic. I think they tried to attempt at some lore or more story with the complaints and emails you find and read on your fazwatch, but it ultimately fails.   Hopefully with time at least the game mechanics will be smoothed out, but I'm unsure if the devs are willing to change entire endings of their game. Let's be honest, they were all disappointing and it was a lot of build up for next to nothing. Sad to call this a Five nights at Freddy's game.
when do you think he will realize he has to shoot the security bots in the eyes to stun them
Lol
I wish they could make one of these not a “scary” thing and just the normal building when it’s open and you can just be a normal person
This game has i think 6  endings
That Vanny ending was so fucking bland. It didn't answer ANY question about its purpose being there. It didn't even answer if it's totally related to Vanessa
Damn "you are my super star" Didn't freddy try to kill us before 🤨 sus
FREDDDAAAAAYYYYYYY
Mark, I'm really glad you said the story doesn't feel cohesive because I was watching CoryxKenshin's playthrough, and once he got to the end, I was like, "Have I not been paying attention? Because I'm not even sure what this game's story is." Glad to know it's not just me. Also, shout out to other comments clearing things up!
Vanessa is vanny -_-
Seeing Mark scream for Freddy was hilarious, the absolute betrayal when Freddy runs past him
Mark choose to leave to see what happends
i also got that patch
when mark is angry he used to scream for the entire video, now he just starts plugging merch haha
Honestly the comic cutscene really creep me out. The 3D cutscene is meh.
I am so confused as to what is going on in this game and how it connects with the others
there are 6 endings to this game good lord ,btw mark got the 5th aka Disassemble
Hey mark I’m just letting you know and not be a back seat gamer but you missed a whole section on Aftons office where Bonnie is I was just gonna let you know and thank you for the amazing content thanks homie
Even if you got the last upgrade it wouldn't have helped the game has multiple endings that was the bad ending
There are 6 different endings to the game
Roxy: Nobody will miss you. Freddy: I will miss you.
This is so funny every time
Did anyone see Markipliers mental health as during Thursday Night Football or was that just me, Great stuff!!!
0:06 💀
The ending is disappointing but when Freddie said "You are my superstar" it made me emotional 😭
Wait till he finds about springtrap in this game
FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!!!
There are some really important, basic information that are lacking, at least in the beginning of the game. It is never explained what the animatronics do to you when they catch you. Shouldn’t they just send you to the security guard, and call your parents? Vanessa does catch you one time and you don’t really die so what’s going on? The premise of the game should also be clear: the whole time, Freddy is biding for time so you can escape… but at the end Gregory says he wants to stop he disappearances? What disappearances! THey were never mentioned, nor Gregory’s aim to stop them, were they? It just seems like important pieces of information are missing, and you’re just supposed to fill them with « oh well, that’s fnaf. You want to know more and bots kill you » yeah sure, you as the player but Gregory is such a blurry character you don’t get his motivations. I don’t understand how hard it was at the beginning to have him say « I am not lost, I am investigating, and the security guard will stop me if she catches me ».  That was way too long but I guess I needed to get that off my chest
Ah, so this game has no story whatsoever Neat
theres absolutely no way they made an entire section of the game and the entire collectible hunt give you only 1 full charge on freddy who is needed for the collectible hunt and no save system at all. Please tell me its not true im losing my mind thats so stupid
game: you cant use recharge stations they are offline mark: WHY CANT I USE THE STATIONS
"did they ran out of budget for the ending?" The first thing that I thought about when I saw that lol
That ending was so bullshit man, like what the fuck? What were they smoking when they made that ending “yeah kill Freddy in a comic style with no follow up”
28:43 Freddy litteraly said yoink
Another day another Markiplier's video, period. (the people who use Tik Tok know where this is from)
There is seven endings isn't there?
I see Mark doesn't care in the slightest about new FNAF games. He's less enthusiastic about them now.
me: *literally crying because of Freddy's "death"* mark: *wheezing excessively*
But how will you find me when you can't even find Freddy?
so sad about the way this game came out..... so unfinished and glitchy makes me so sad :((
Mark u better finish the game! You haven’t even gone trough 50% of it
⚠️⛔WARNING ⛔⚠️ ⚠️⛔WARNING⛔⚠️ LOT of spoilers ✨in this comment section so do yourself a favor and finish the video before you scroll down.
Not watched the episode yet but I believe that Gregory isn't what he appears to be, the vanny he keeps seeing is a figment of his imagination, adults only signs set up by his other self ala total recall-the film. For you see, he is himself truly   GREG THE BUNNY!!!
If you come to roxy raceway and pick up the head again, the game bugs out a little and you can save. Just thought I'd throw it out there in case you'd want to know
Hey Mark! Idk if you’ll ever see my comment at all, but I thought I would give this a shot. I love your video’s and they always seem to cheer me up when I was in a bad mood. I was watching one of your videos from 2 years ago, a video of you playing “Dark Deception”, there have been new chapters added and I would love to see you play more of this game. Anyways, that’s really all I wanted to say and I’m not expecting my comment to be noticed, but if it does then keep up the good work, again I love your videos!!  Ps: I enjoyed watching this episode, it made me laugh a lot :)
Mark should've been the voice actor for Freddy.
I think they didn’t intent you to spam
Scott Cawthon left the production during the last cutscene 🤣
Theirs more than one ending!! I looked at all of the possibly endings and they actually aren’t bad at all
I cant wait to see the last part of the video animated.
Awokawokawokawoka
Pretty sure they didnt want to animate a living human being “disassembled” for the game genre
Not going to click the other videos so Mark will come find me.
This whole thing is like a fever dream-
well that ending was remarkably inconclusive and disappointing, i expected so much more at the beginning but knew it was gonna be bad after seeing how loosely the storyline was pieced together along with all the bugs and errors. bogus as hell
Markiplier King of five night of freddy's bet ol of the games
The moment when freddy ran straight past Mark had me dying xD  "FREDDY YOU BITCH! FREDDYYYY" 28:42
29:15 Top 10 Anime betrayals💀
I think it's because you spam call him and he follows each ping
10/10 intro
Its lovely to see mark try and figure out how to get the true ending. Might should consider checking out those arcade maschines the game has teased in the messages.
IF SOMEONE GIVES SPOILERS MARK WILL COME AND FIND YOU.....
i thought the same thing he did, did they run out of budget
I think he does and always has gone to the spot where you summoned him.
The right ending is supposed to be you have to play all the princess quest 1,2 and 3 in order to have the right ending
love how he completely forgot that he has chica's voicebox which stuns animatronics
Is it just me or whenever Freddy says you are my superstar makes me cry 🥲
mark there are 6 endings that is all i wish to say
u didnt try using the lazar blaster in moon mans eyes
This ending was to satisfactory. The type of bug type bs id go through if really needed saving
I played it and i know how Monty dies. The camera works on the cleaning bots, security bots
That Freddy betrayal needs an animation!
I really love that early edit XDXD
i just rewatched your sister location series, and in part two you asked who “she” is watching on the security cameras.  maybe it’s vanessa the security guard in this game…maybe connects how she got the job???
The intro got me ngl
#1 trending for gaming!!! You go mark❤❤❤❤
Been watching mark forever but his tryna b philosophical shit ends up making him sound dumb af sometimes and it's annoying
you can save with the head from raceway in inventory. go get head at raceway🤣🤣
I think marks reaction is genuinely the most realistic lmao. I'm sorry but these endings where SO WEIRD. we jump from animation cutscene to a comic book?? it's it's so badly paced and CONFUSING LIKE . it was just so weird to jump from a slow "Gregory. let's go find vanny!" to a cutscene where he gets fucking killed within 20 seconds and then you're expected to LEAP into a chase scene when you have NO IDEA WHATS HAPPENING. the only way this scene makes sense is if you happen to do the fazer blaster thing just before 6am. then it makes sense that you've just scene vannys hideout etc etc. however if you do it any other way (which is how the game is intended because its bloody freeroam) you're just thrown into something you absolutely have no idea about! Not to mention that you're expected to do the entire last animatronic boss battle without even one save ! This game has difficulties with pacing anyway, but the endings are by far the worst. All of them are so confusing,  some more than others but even the most common ending (Gregory just leaving) is SO ANTICLIMATIC FOR THIS GAME !! honestly rhis is such a sore disappointment and it's so janky- I wish it was paced better. Even if they just added better pacing and story development it would make the other problems in the game not nearly as noticeable or bad.
This game seems so bad what the hell happened lmao
I remember getting over it
Eow
Freddy: *literally dies* Mark: so anyway I started wheezing
Freddy runs to where he is called, not you, so if you spam the button he will just continually run to where you were when you pressed it
vanny
Does anyone have a time tag for when Monty is chasing mark and he summons Freddy but Freddy just runs right by him and mark starts screaming at him? Lmao
Join us for a bite. 💖
Bruh really just raged quit
24:47 I think they made/planed the Pizzaplax and then built the story after. That's probably why most of the missions are go to A, then B, than C, than back to A, because they wanted to utilize the locations in the Pizzaplax as much as possible however, they obviously couldn't use EVERYTHING they made
Mark you should do the leaving ending just to complete them all
The daycare theatre is used as a location during the Monty fetch quests, the only locations with no purpose that I can think of are Chica's bakery and Kids Cove - there's nothing attached to them but we could have DLC in the future.
VANASSSSAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!
why is this game so... bad?
Freddy blowing right past Mark and Mark's high-pitched incredulous screaming is the funniest thing I've seen in ages. Tears. It's such a disconnect seeing how rabid fandom is all "papa freddy protecc" when the actual experience is him not giving one sheet about you at times or being too buggy to do as intended.
This game is the jankiest POS since Cyberpunk 2077.
Gregory is one loud ass kid… from the start up until now…
LORE
Hearing Mark screaming at Freddy as he runs past "FREDDY YOU BITCH" in the highest possible pitch he can manage is just amazing
28:41 Freddy: sorry Greg but i forgot that i left my charger plugged in, brb tho!
Firsttt
28:42 gentleman scream
i literally screamed NOOOO when you picked vanny becsuse i knew what was gonna happen
The princess quest games give more insight for the vannessa storyline. There is also an area under the pizzaplex where they said that large amounts of power was being used and people went to investigate it but no more info was given after that.
Egg
28:39 The absolute betrayal of Freddy. We are hurt.     This is why I like Chica.
Been thinking about buying this game but watching marks frustration with some of the bugs and the misdirection and kind of lack-luster explanation of what actually needs to be done throws me off of it. Glad I watched this playthrough. I think ill wait for it to be on sale lol. Definitely seems rushed and they didnt utilize all the areas/characters properly. I remember the trailers having vannessa wanting to help and explain what was going on to freddy. The fact they took that out and changed it makes sense why the story is so confusing.
Game: GO TO THE EXIT Mark: Does literally EVERY SINGLE THING EXCEPT THAT
Dude I watched the whole palythru with you, you have to win it the proper waw please
Knowing that Freddy has to go exactly where you summoned him to, in the order of locations you summoned him, makes the end of this video so hard to watch
I’ll need to come back to this when I’m sober minded, this is too much for me right now
The area you are looking for is in Roxy's Raceway. A door.
What on earth-- I think the game needed a little more time in the oven..
28:40 FREEEDYYYYYYYY!
28:42 genuinely made me laugh so hard lol
I feel like they might have created a world so big and unused just to comeback to it in different updates like this is the original plot line but maybe other plot lines will develop in this same map in the future?
I love how nothing in this game works as intended. This is Cyberpunk levels of broken.
I feel like this is going to end with Freddy killing Gregory
Me seeing Freddy dying: cool but he's a robot you know. Not like us humans, when we die we die. Robots  is just a machine, fix it and good as new.
Completely agree with your critiques of the game. 100%. Clearly it wasn’t as flushed out as it was meant to be and the comic strip ending is SO anticlimactic compared to the awesome 3D detailing of the rest of the game. Like what  happened!?
Mark there are so Many endings you need too Fins Them all
" did they run out of budget? " lmao mark know everything
I love your videos
I love your videos
Sorry but, fun gameplay aside, this game has been pretty shit storywise, and that ending was horrible. Had the same disbelief Mark had. The sudden cut from decision making, to a random cutscene of Freddy dying, a quick chase sequence, and then a comic - felt beyond unfulfilled with that. It felt sloppy and rushed. A lot of the game was fun but had a lot of flaws sadly that I felt Mark was getting frustrated with!
Love how he doen't use chika's ability.
Well maybe if you weren't fucking spamming the button, you would've been okay...!
Bro Mark's attention span and ability to retain I formation is getting worse by the episode.
I just putting it out there. There is multiple endings. Good, bad, true, and secret ending.
What if I already have been listening to distractable
“There has to be more” 28:40  *Freddy runs past him* -Ending up dead- ending video
MARK, LISTEN TO ME!!!!! THERE ARE FIVE ENDINGS!!!!  HAPPILY EVER AFTER: You and Freddy leave through the loading docks.   THE TRUTH ENDING: You gather all of the collectables and gift boxes, and leave through an emergency exit. THIS IS WHEN YOU FIND OUT WHO/WHAT VANNY TRULY IS!!!!!  CHOICES AT THE DOOR (STAY, LEAVE, OR VANNY)  THE LEAVE ENDING: You take your chance and leave, but you may not like the ending...  THE VANNY ENDING: You need to play Princess Quests 1 + 2. THEN, you need to do the Vanny option again. Go to Vanessa's room to play Princess Quest 3 and get the ending. (I guess you find out their identity?)  THE STAY ENDING: Get the Monty upgrade for Freddy, then go back to Roxy Raceway. There should be two gates: one that will lead you down stairs, and the other, when you turn left and wander, you should find the gate. (HINT: THE GATES YOU NEED TO ENTER HAVE A ,"NO MONTY," SIGN ON THE GATES) Where it will lead you to is a door that will take you down a flight of stairs, along with the last gate you need to break. When you look, you will see a gate that will automatically open, as well as an elevator you will need to take..... NO SPOILERS!!! GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN, MARK!!! :) > ∞
Lol
Really wish the caution bot edits were in game. They sound so good and are ao fitting
Mark theres 7 endings that you didnt know lol
There's multiple endings
I love how mark either ignored or forgot every instruction he was given.
Hi done
Freddy: * dies*  Mark: *WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZE*
Mark: *Spamming the Spawn Freddy button, making Freddy start pathing to where the Spawn Freddy button was pressed, which is BEHIND Monty* Also Mark: "FREDDY! FREDDY! FREDDY HOW DARE YOOOUUUU!!"
damn, they got their funding cut for that ending for real..
technically since Vanny isn’t an animatronic, Gregory basically saw her get disemboweled
10:45 is the first jumpscare this whole series that actually got me lol
I hope he's gonna try to get the other endings too. For so far I know there are multiple endings but not really sure on that
over 80 gigs of storage only a few hours of gameplay some npc's are moving at 12 fps bugs galore   FNAF fans: "omg this is the greatest game ever made"
PLEASE ITS 1 AM AND I LAUGHED SO HARD AT 29:10 THAT I STARTED COUGHING-  We love you Mark 😭😭💖
After seeing that message in the theater I’m convinced Gregory is really Balloon Boy
i was rolling when he was screaming for Freddy!
I wanted to see the other ending
omg this was amazing!!!! the panic of him running from monty.
Good getting on number 1 trending on gaming lol
I still can't get fully used to Freddy just stomping while sprinting to go to Gregory. I still sometimes think that Freddy will just get Gregory lol.
The “vanny” ending made me cry, I get way too attached to these guys
The way Freddy doesn't over crowd the stairway in such a polite manner makes him a true superstar. It also makes him hilarious!
There are 5 endings i wont tell you how to get them that is cheating
Try to go back into the daycare from the slide and you see somthing funny.
Markiplier playing fnaf several years ago: “FREDDY DON’T FRICK WITH ME, FREDDY, GO TO HELL!  Markiplier playing fnaf now: “c’mon Freddy, let’s be besties on an adventure together!”
Hey mark you should also try to get all the upgrades and fazcam, then go to the charging station near the upgrade station, then go down the long hallway bathroom route, and if you get inside Freddy to at the moment you see a couch you should see something try to get to it and there should be a really cool Easter egg that also gives you some story too and remember that you need the fazcam and to use it to try to figure out when but if you can’t I’ll tell you right now to use it on the wall.
You arent as scary as Jerma when you smile, its more a scary thing when you look dispointed
Well if you find me let me know, because I haven’t found myself. 😬
When Mark doesn’t remember Freddy saying the charging stations wouldn’t work the last hour.
You can see the hope in mark's eyes when Freddy comes up the stairs towards him, only for it to be dashed away as he runs past him. XD
Freddy: No. I cannot exit this facility. (Proceeds to exit the facility in every other ending)
I think this is the first video I hear Markiplier scream so many times at high pitch voice. hahahahahahaha so funnyyy~ make my day.
Find springtrap
28:41
Freddy booking it past mark was the funniest thing I’ve seen in ages
Gosh that killed me at the end xD RIP
This game needed at least another year’s worth of work. It’s one more game on the pile of unfinished trash we got this year.
11:39 this glitch happened to MatPat and he had to restart and update the game so try that ig??????
Why is mark so confused it's fairly straightforward what's happening
So I feel like a lot was missed? The Monty boss fight and the afton, spring trap boss fight and a lot of areas missed? Am I right or wrong?
Mark in the canny option when you go into her office you can play the princess quest and get another ending
I love content like this, it’s funny AND good content on a well known fandom
17:56 is the moment when the confusion and laughter starts
im super late
Mark you better go the way down so you have the secret ending
we don't enjoy your suffering 😅
I love how mark hasn’t figured out how Freddy actually works. You can’t call Freddy over and over and over again. He’s not a dog. You also can’t move from the location you call him. It’s like a queue. He has to go to every pin that you drop. 😂
the first 10 seconds got me dead
I can't stop laughing at Mark screaming Freddy's name in vain as Monty is nibbing on him.🤣
Pls come find me
This is #1 trending on gaming holy shit
Looking forward to more.
Mark just casually screams FREDDY so much 🤣🤣🤣
"hello guys it's Markiplier" will never get old
The ending had me cackling 😂😂😂
Mark you can get a very crazy ending but you must not exit anytime when Freddy suggests it you must also acquire all the upgrades and then go to an old elevator at the end of the game this will give you the true ending
Pls bare with me while mark takes a bagillion years to find freddy starting @4:59 Mark: *intentionally leaves Freddy* *calls for Freddy twice* "Freddy where r u?.." *calls* "Freddy?" *call*  "Freddy." "freddy.. Freddy? "HURRY UP FREDDY!"  *calls* "NO HERE" *completely ignores mark and goes to rocky's room since she's deado* "WHER R U GOING?!"  *calls* "FREDDY R U SERIOUS!" *call*  "... FREDDDY NOT THERE!!" *keeps calling him* "o my gawd" *calls* "o-o my gawd" *calls* "are u kidding me" *call* (x2) "Freddy?" *calling* "..Freddy" *call* "Freddy." *call* *call* "Freddy" *call* *call* *call* "FREDDY!?!" *call*  "FREDDYYYYY" *irrelvant talk* *call*(x16) "WHERE R Uuuuu?!" *calls, while daytime killer thing says goodnight* "okay-"  *call* "this is wonderful.. Fredyy-"  *call* "pls" *call* "theRE YOUR R U ASSHOLE!!!"  This concludes Mark is a complete dumbass. Thank you for your time *bows*
Why tf did you not try the LEAVE option
Such an awesome game
There is like 4-5 more endings
I think Mark should've voiced Freddy
Freddy just lets Greg destroy his friends to get new upgrades. Freddy could have reported Greg to Vanessa, kept him his his chest cavity, locked him in a room...
Everyone: crying when Freddy dies Mark: *intense laughing*
18:08
It'd be better if Freddy came to YOU not the point you that you pressed the button at
28:44 I'M CRYING OMG i was feeling so tense and then that comic relief knocked me out 😂 the screaming was too good
Mark! Your #2 trending for gaming! Amazing job and this is really fun to watch, I rewatch this series every day and I am still not bored! Well done, you are my favourite youtuber and, YOU ACTUALLY READ COMMENTS! thank you so much for that, I don’t now many youtubers that go through comments, especially big youtubers with millions of subscribers!
he never actually just clicked the normal leave option
I like how he walks away from the door at the beginning
"See you later Superstar!"  "Freddy! FREDDY!"
28:43 i can't stop laught 🤣 Freddy: don't forget You are My superstar  Markiplier :  super bitch  🤣
Merry Christmas everyone ❤️
you know mark. they are more endings in this game. there's like five of them. if you can find these. but you found one already. if this community tell you where they are. and also there's one Easter egg in here. from the VR game. but I'm not going to tell you where is it. but I believe you will find it. good luck :)
The “best” ending has to deal with the “Princess Quest” side quest
This is just way to funny to me just seeing Mark just get mad.
Gregory: *Getting chased by Monty*  Freddy: 🏃‍♂️↖️
these game mechanics are garbage dude idk how you play it...
If you finish the Freddy upgrade and cannot save and light is out. Go to the way out and choose stay, and the save is error. And then go to the Roxxy Raceway and pick up the robot head ao you can use the Save system again
mark is literally going insane from playing this game
28:40 😆
This game feels like a bad fan made game rather than a true fnaf.... it just doesn't feel like fnaf  maybe it's because Mark hasn't "finished it" yet but idk if this is actually the end that's kinda weird
28:44 The biggest betrayal
PLEASE let that moment of Freddy running past him become a Markiplier Animated. 😂😂
If markplier, played yugioh. What deck would he play? 🤔
a family can be an animatronic bear and his human son
Heaven and hell are two very real literal places. And we all deserve Hell because we all have sinned and fall short of God's glory (Romans 3:23.) Nobody is righteous, nobody is sinless, and God will justly give us what we deserve by casting us in Hell for eternity where there is no rest. But even though we deserve Hell, God is still gracious and loving to us. He sent his only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to give us another chance. Jesus lived a perfect sinless life, He was tempted in every way as we are yet He never sinned. He paid the price for our sins when He was crucified and died a horrible death. Isaiah 53 says His appearance was disfigured beyond that of any man and His form was marred beyond human likeness. Jesus suffered to take the punishment we rightly deserve. Then, He was buried for 3 days, but He conquered death and rose again on the 3rd day. Jesus offers you the free gift of Eternal Life. He wishes that all would come to Him, and He will never turn you away. If you simply believe that Jesus did die for your sins and rose again on the 3rd (1 Corinthians 15 1-4) , and if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart God raised Him from the dead (Romans 10:9-10) then you are saved. No matter what you have done, Jesus loves you, He wants you to accept His free gift of Eternal Life. Now, you're probably laughing at me right now and scoffing, but I only say this because even though I don't know you, I love and care for you. I don't want you to end up in Hell. You know in your heart that this is true, Jesus is Lord. Don't suppress the truth, your eternity is at stake. Please just think about it.   Revelation 3:20 "Here I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him and he with me." Revelation 22:17 "Whoever is thirsty, let him come; and whoever wishes, let him take the free gift of the water of life."
Freddy the type of guy to wake up in the middle of the night to investigate a sound in a nightgown, cap, and pair of slippers with a candle in hand
This feels like fnaf world situation again, I hope they spend time to fix and update the game like it should have been, much like fnaf world.
Me:always pausing the vid bc monty is scary Me:FREDDY JUST BE A GOOD ROBOT FOR ONCE
While it makes for entertaining moments, the absolute broken and non-sensical design of this game is frustrating just to watch. I can't imagine how much hair I'd be pulling out if I was playing this. At times it felt like utter polish and had a huge map filled with secrets. But then it just rushed you through the hours, filled the place with damn security bots and then had you leave with barely anything about the story actually answered. Whoever decided to have a good 50% of the story answers left at a point where you are prevented from saving needs a damn smack on the back of head. This game is a perfect example of tense horror being reduced to mindless and needless frustration at the player's expense :(
Different exits = different endings
28:40 Freddy said "SIKE BITCH!!!"
You can access  the video gen by by getting the faze cam and taking a picture of chicka foxy Bonnie and freddy
its incredibly infuriating that mark never sneaks.there are security bots. there are hiding spots. omg then he stops turns around and runs into the same bot AGAIN...its like he constantly forget that getting caught will spawn someone right there no matter what and he just keeps running and setting off more and more and more and passing every hiding spot...MY GUY lmao
My favourite line is FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!!!!!!!
Cant wait for the next 1
"I will find you" - Markiplier
why short
They broke Freddy
The freddy-calling mechanic is so broken because the AI is instructed to approach the last position of where the calling was performed, I think, instead of ACTUALLY following Gregory.  I don't know if it was an oversight or not, or maybe they found a bug where Freddy will constantly follow Gregory after a single call until he went up into Freddy and  they wouldn't bother looking for a fix.
He should play those arcade games that are hidden about the pizzaria, aka the princesses Quest
I'm very confused about this game, and it feels like the weakest in what was otherwise a pretty good franchise. Yes it got very convoluted very quickly, but it made for excellent mind exercise, trying to piece everything together and sifting through clues. This started out strong but now towards the end it's a bit more muddled. It's still really fun and the graphics look amazing but the story feels very bare boned here... idk...
instructions:make it to the front door mark:does the opposite and dies also mark:wait what happened😭😭😭😭😭😭 that make me laugh way to hard
I'm pretty sure Freddy goes to where you /press/ the button. Not where you are afterwards. Also, I lost it when Freddy just sprinted past Mark 🤣
not going to click the links because a personal visit from mark would b pretty cool ngl
Mark: *literally screaming for Freddy*  Freddy: *legit bolts past him* WHERE ARE YOU SUPERSTAR??
Ok. So Mark. There's this game, I'm sure you'd love it. It's called fictorum. You can thank me later :P
I've never been so **not** involved in a FNAF game(besides FNAF World but no one remembers that game lol). I don't want to sugar coat it, but I'm kindof disappointed tbh. We've been waiting for Security Breach for a while now. Yes, I know there is more game to be played, Yes I know I haven't seen it all. But an ending like this just feels...blunt. Having an ending SO early that there is still a huge mystery that we don't even know about.  It's cool to be changing things up, and that's how franchises succeed and prolong themselves, but this just feels like such a far cry from any FNAF game. And I have to admit, I dont think the team was quite ready for such an ambitious project. Obviously the environment is amazing, and the character designs I love, animations are decent. But having a massive story based horror game, does not fit the strengths of this team. In my opinion, both the story(so far) and the horror fall flat.   There is so much useless message info on the watch. Worldbuilidng is important, but I think some other things could have been utilized. How did FazEnt. become this massive empire? Who is Gregory, and why is he here? Having much more dialogue between Gregory and Freddy could have given us a lot more exposition and developed the two characters relationships, making it more emotional when Freddy perished, or seeing how he feels when Gregory hurts his friends.  And the horror. In my experience, there was not much that got me invested, there was no tension save for a few key moments. I wanted to skip sections. A lot of it felt like fetch quests, with annoying robots who were supposed to be a threat.  Last thing before this becomes 3 pages long: Why the heck would they make it so you cant save when you want to stay? You are not given enough time in the game to complete other objectives, and when they finally give you the time they cut the safety net? Having no saves should be a thing you can opt into, like difficulty levels
But...but...Mark must get the other endings. Honestly you should be happy you're not playing on PS5. The bugs on PS5 are...awful. Ive managed to get level 12 access (you're not supposed to do that) fall through the world, get stuck inside Freddy, get stuck outside of Freddy, the fire in the Roxy fight is invisible, the vanny option never presented itself, the Princess Quest Arcade cabinets all have PC inputs (and even when you plug in a Keyboard the inputs dont do anything), and more. Or maybe you should have played the PS5 version XD
ok hear me out, vanny kinda-
"Good news, it is almost a cOck" made me laugh out loud xD
Bro the ending that Mark originally got could have been so much more impactful if it wasn’t rushed and then suddenly a comic scene 😂
wow, what is a mess the final part of this game
If you can just hop in and out of Freddy with no problem,wouldn’t this make him power armour?  He is a literal suit of power armour is he not?
28:40 has to be the best moment in the playthrough so far
Wait, how did Mark get the vanny ending, he didn't play the princess quest arcade games... then again this game has quite a few bugs
Mark, Freddy says he found a party pass so you don’t need to go look for one
Really you are king of fnaf
The game is so buggy what the heck
This game is so abhorrently broken and unfinished. It honestly just...makes me so sad to see something that had a lot of potential flop so hard...
sobbing rn
For the True an best ending you must play princess quest 1,the 2 were the music Mann chase scene was,and then you have to take Vanny as Choice and play 3 in Vannys Room.
Did anyone else cry when at the ending Freddy said "You are my little superstar" or was that just me
your game is just broken, the ending will not change if you just get Montys claws because you were supposed to be getting them before 6am. Plus you didnt find a single CD or anything ^-^"
"did they run out of budget for the last animation" HAHJFLDH' FD
I don't if I like Mark screaming my name saying "please please and not like this!!!"
I was watching this and remembered that mark was in a mental health awareness commercial I saw today😂
So... I'm getting the sense that this game is not... good. Is that right?
*The outro was the most savages thing i've seen*
I never smiled at a psychopath's smiley face until now
If Mark really does want to stop Monty too (assuming you can before the ending since it's a quest) he should go back to another save file so he can actually save while he does that. If it's anything like Roxy's part he's gonna need it. 😂
PLEASE PLAY INSCRYPTION MARK!!!!
One of the things I hate in this game is how it breaks its own rules but neglects to tell you that. Like, you are told Freddy is a safe place against other animatronics and that they cannot get you inside of him, yet, mark clearly does die to the daycare animatronic while inside Freddy. (12:24) Not only that, but anytime you actually need Freddy for protection, he is inaccessible like in the fazcade with the massive amount of security bots or Monty with the sunglasses (making him invincible to the Lazer gun). It's just really annoying to have a safe space, but only be able to use it when you don't ever need it. And once Mark gets the Lazer gun, Freddy becomes less than worthless, because now he can just blaze past and blind any animatronics that try to kill him. Really disappointed by how Freddy was used, at least in this playthrough.
Your channel is the best!
Mark is SO obnoxious to watch omfg. Good for you with all your success or whatever but it ain’t for me
I'm the only one who almost died when he said "you are my superstar" :'D
They deffiently created the pizzaplex before they wrote the story
There is a secret somwere were you can get to the old restraint and you can find spring trap
Unpopular opinion: this game was rushed
There surely is more, it can’t end like this, you got this Mark! We believe in you! And I’m sure Freddy won’t leave you to die again 😅
Can't wait for the next video lol
1. That looked like a Fortnite animation 2. What
🍇
I want u to find me lol
the outro sounded very strange this time around, it occurred to me that even though its a video and IM the one seeing mark it really sounded like mark will see ME in the next video
Fun fact: you can't actually get a level 10 security pass. Instead, level 10 rooms are used exclusively by animatronics. Inside they are shortcuts to all places of the mega plex...so conically they explain why animatronics can get to you so quickly.
this game is just... so bad. this game is so confusing i can barely understand what is going on at any point in the game (not due to markiplier). story makes no sense and there are so many bugs
did he not want to see how the Leave option ended?
Mark: "UGHHH AHHHHH" I feel your pain Mark
theres a LOT there if you look for every duffle bag and tidbit. Bonny was last seen entering monty golf. We know monty replaced bonny as the base player. Most likely monty destroyed bonny to get his chance at the spotlight. If you take Freddy to Bonnie Bowling to the stage thats closed there, he says "I dont come here anymore... i miss him".   The other animatronics are not actually trying to kill Gregory, that is until he severely damages them; one separating factor in this game that i personally dont like because it makes Gregory feel evil. The ACTUAL story behind this game is VANNY, or GlitchTrap... who is controlling vanessa at times. Afaik Vanessa has no clue that Vanny is controlling her.. as we can tell form the scene where Vanessa puts Greg in a room and then Vanny comes in for the kill. Playing the Princess Quest Games will get you to the BEST ending which you can achieve without damaging ANY animatronics and you save Vanessa from Vanny. The theme on the title screen is thePrincess Quest theme... this game is about the curse of Vanny/GlitchTrap.   The supposed CANON ending takes you to the basement to light the old place on fire... again. This ultimately leads to all the animatronics save Freddy being destroyed... and Springtrap being taken away by Molten/Funtime Freddy blob.   TLDR: seems like this game needed alot more time and tons of stuff was cut. Lots of areas completely unused until youre "allowed" to go there just for a secret plushy. Tons of story that just had no meaning or reason. Everything inferred. Which means the writing was non-existant.
28:37 PLS WHY DOES FREDDY RUN STRAIGHT PAST HIM I CAN'T
its sad that Fnaf Sb is rushed
Bait out the jump, then zap him with the blaster, cause I know ya zapped him once. I think his glasses fall off after a charge. I could be wrong however, but I'm pretty sure
This is old markiplier playing here this is some funny shit
what the hell is this game
I need that ending to be animated that is golden, just the chaos of Mark’s high pitched screams and him trying to dodge Monty and the security bots is killing me 🤣🤣🤣
I really like this game. It has a totally different feel from other FNaF games and the decision to make Freddy your (somewhat unstable) companion was a brilliant one, in my opinion.  It's definitely unfinished, but I think if they continued to work on it, add a few free patches to touch it up some (especially bug fixes, though as glitchy as the game is, it's not *horribly* glitchy, it's mostly just a bit of jank and irritation), maybe add some DLC down the line for the areas that weren't used, it could be great.  I already want a miniature scale replica of Glamrock Freddy. I love the whole attempt at this mix of 80s futurism in the pizza plaza's design. It's fun, but doesn't take away from the terror of it all that much.
I was so sad all of this happened but then Mark comes in with the big brain time and loads straight to the choice.
29:17 The fact that the amount of anger in Mark's voice makes the microphone fuzz up is just hilarious 😂
Pretty sure how Freddy works is-  -When you call him, he spawns at the nearest recharge. -He goes to where you called him first. -Pressing the button repeatedly probably confuses the AI.
It’s so funny because the fact that mark has been over the entire place and yet still can’t remember where to go and I find that so funny. 😂
mark can remember the company meeting is at thursday 11:30 but not how the recharge stations are offline at the end of the game as he tried repeatedly to get into one
Mark becoming more and more unhinged is fascinating to watch
Am I the only one who thinks this game needed another year of development? There’s a lot of bugs and a lot of stuff that just doesn’t make sense. I desperately wanted this to be a good game. Granted, I don’t think it’s awful, and I think the bugs have made some funny moments. But I feel like everyone’s ignoring the elephant in the room that the game didn’t turn out super well done.
My heart was literally racing when Mark was trying to get away from Monty at the end lol
Yep, the game is really bad...
mark - is this like my last chance to get collectibles? well.. kinda ya
that last scene had me laughing my damn ass off
Mark: FRESSY YOU BASTAAAAAARD!!!  That entire scene got me dying. Thanks Freddy. Very cool.
Yessssssss part 7!!!
Mark please finish the game 100 percent and get all 6 endings!!!
One game I’ve always loved since it released was Ghost of Tsushima, and in this game if you called your horse, no matter how far away he was, he’d magically appear from any direction that you weren’t looking in, and then they changed it and he’d just never be as fast again. Freddy is now like my horse Fabio
Freddy did nothing wrong, remember that...
Its funny how freddy has an ability that stuns animatronics but he never uses it
Markiplier, try to get the secret endings because there are a bunch of things you are missing..like a ton. You can play past 6AM.
Note: The Moondrop guy spawns at about 5:55 am because you are basically timed
dammm well merry christmas  ig (for tommorow)
From what I know, there are 6 endings total
... this game is forty dollars
The amount of bots in this comment section 🙄🤦🏽‍♀️ ... I think my report button got broken 😂
Theory, they scraped the entire game and released this, that’s why the staff bots are so weird and put everywhere as place holders with levels where they fill entire sections
Freddy: *dies of cringe*
I'm curious of other finals, but, the game, it's really BAD developed. And wtf was that comic final?? Was that supposed to be sad? I had the same reaction you had, wtf.
Bro why was the story and the just going through the game so random
For reference for anyone interested there are 6 endings in this game so you got alot of hunting to do :3
Markiplier: **About to be savagely murdered by Monty** "Freeeddddyyyy!!!!"  Freddy" **Runs past Mark**  Markiplier: "FREDDY, YOU DUMB BITCH SAVE MEEEEE!!" > O <  - - -  XD Easily the most hilarious moment in this whole series. I mean did anyone ever think we'd have a moment of Mark CALLING FOR HELP FROM FREDDY?! Just that alone should win Scott Cawthon and his team a heap awards, let alone that moment when predictably Mark relies on him and Freddy doesn't come. At just the moment he needs him too!  I wonder if Mark will get all the endings that have been sussed out pre DLCs? Which I'm not sure I buy that three star ending as 'the true' ending.  Oh and has anyone told Mark he missed a whole heap of discs that sort of explain the Vanny situation? X3
:)      The outro can be used as a meme
Lixian makes Freddy say cluck :      *cluck*
22:33 BABY
Amy in the next room just questioning what on earth is happening to make Mark scream as high as he did when Freddy ran past him like that
“FREDDY, YOU BITCH! FREDDY! FREDDY!”
5:16 freed had enough of hearing mark so he goes his own way
This game is so bad. Ending is sooo lameee
Idk if you got the line yet but when you’re in Bonnie’s area Freddy says “I don’t come up here anymore. I miss him.”
11:39 Mark they said all save and recharge station were turned of Bud like in the last episode
the freddy/monty/gregory chase is quite literally my favorite thing so far
that smile during the outro bit literally looks like the godamn moon sun animatronic man thing
this game has felt like a fever dream is that just me???
Game: tries to make a very emotional moment between Gregory and Freddy.  Mark: *CONFUSED WHEEZING*             Edit: literally just got out of bed to see the chaos happening in the reply section.
There's like 8 more endings you know that right
25:00 given the 50gb and general gameplay it looks like it started out intending to be a VR game
mark bein a mark slow
10:45 Oh I guess he can't- GAH WTFUHCTFJK
I KEPT JUMPING AT MOONDROP OMG 😭
The intro is like a shitpost
The roller coaster of emotion Mark went through was hilarious, the sheer panic of getting chased by Monty then the moment of relief when Freddy shows up followed by absolute betrayal when he runs past him
Have the disappearances Gregory is referencing even been brought up in the game? Have we seen Vanny more than twice? Why was he stuck in there in the first place? Why does Freddy know something evil is going on? What was Plan A? So many questions
Omg Freddy I'd so unreliable when you need him to be
GRRR BARKBARK MARK YOU NEED TO OPEN THE POSTER
I think freddy bugged to run to each place where the call button was pressed so spamming it breaks him??? Idk man
Mark asking if they ran out of budget but animating that last scene would have instantly put the rating to M.
Yes
He needs to keep playing he is missing so much story
I can conclude the intro and outro are the best parts of this video
28:40 Peak AI Performance
I barely just started to watch this part but why didn't you use your blaster at the beginning
what a absalout mess and rubbish pile of a fnaf game....scott sshould feel ashamed for releasing this.
Freddyyyeeeaeeeeeoeyeyee
that intro cracked me up so quick lol
Freddy: “I’m coming Gregory! I’ll save you from Monty!” **Comes over and stands in front of Gregory for one second** Freddy: “OH WAIT, one moment my Uber eats is at the door”
lol.. jumpscare animation not loaded 3:33
I literally thought it was so sad and mark laughs 😭
Does Mark understand that Freddy comes to the spot where you call him and not to the player.
Honestly i really appreciate freddy in this game he is so nice and we get attach to him :3 sure why he is nice can be suspicious but i appreciate those moments :)
is this the end of Fnaf Security breach for mark? idk lol probably
28:44 "BIRD INTENSIFIES"
FreDYDYYDYDYDY FREDDDYYYYYy AHHHHHHH FREDDY YOU BASTARDD
I think you deserve a reward 😏 go check the main stage 🥴
Freddy said in the previous episode that the recharging stations were shut down.
Is it just me or has Mark gotten a bit more annoying lately?
MarkPark: Game Theory 2
Hey Billy what was your favorite episode of the Markipliers? "I like the one where Mark screamed at Freddie for a looooong time."
“That better be Freddy!”  One day it won’t be Freddy. One day.
There is another ending
Gregory, do you see the small vent on the floor? have you ever heard of among us, gregory? you need to vent. i know it will be hard for you to be  sus, but i know you can do it gregory.
I'm crying. When Freddy ran past Mark 😂
Honestly, when I watched the first few episodes of the game here, I really feel interested and a desire to try it myself. However, that has quickly changed during the last few episodes.  The game looks great, but it feels so incomplete and messy. It’s as if they went completely nuts with creating large, beautiful areas with their own interesting concepts, but then ran out of time and/or interest afterwards.  The halls are rarely used, the story feels “rushed” as in you never really get to feel the personalities of the antagonists. I mean, we only see Vanessa twice in total, and only one of them allows her to catch you, the “missions” are mostly just fetch-and-grab objectives, where you run from 1 area to the next and then to the third and then back again, over and over. And the problem with that is that they gave us so many unique encounters early on in the game, which all felt familiar, and yet new enough to not feel boring.  The game is generally okay. Not good, nor bad. But okay, if you ask me. It feels more like an early access, where the developers have only managed to fully flesh out the early parts of the game yet, and I really hope that future patches/DLC fixes that. Otherwise, I’m afraid this game will just end up being a flawed game with an insane amount of potential.
this is the worst fnaf game and one of the worst games made so far XD wtf is going on? everythings so random, so clunky, no sense of a story, characters are bland and boring, how has scott not been annoyed with what they have done to his franchise?
Freddy: my new eyes let me see so well! also freddy: *runs right past mark*
that 5 mil views on playstation trailer should've make the quality check team to goes "yea we need more game polish"
Its a shame this game came out so unfinished. I honestly think this could've been the best FNAF game if it was delayed for another 6 - 12 months.
Freddy's not broken, you just keep pressing the button *while* running away. Get to a safe spot first and THEN call Freddy so he doesn't need to run to every spot you've call him to.
Omg I was crying at the end 😭😂
Man they should NOT have released this game, its entirely ruined the game for me with the amount of bugs that entirely breaks the game.
One thing that confuses me a lot is why the animatronics are trying to hurt you. People say that its because theyre being controlled/messed with but then why don't they attack Vanessa? Vanessa seems to act like everything is normal.
I just imagine the AI with 43,714 waypoints where Freddy is supposed to be running and mark screaming "NO, HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE?!?!? I CLEARLY ONLY MEAN THIS ONE EXACT WAYPOINT!!! IGNORE THE OTHER 14,000 ONES IVE SET!!!  HOW CAN YOU BE SO STUPID!!!"
i think they made it so freddy comes to the players position that you summoned him so if you move and press it itll glitch out probanly
I gotta say, I was not expecting that beginning but it was very hilarious
This video is a brain drain
The desperate screams of Freddy for help made this episode amazing. This was the most hysterical one yet.
Im so confused
I've never disliked one of your videos till now
Ill just say this.. Yes, there is another ending by upgrading Freddy with Monty's Claws.
A little of the meatcanyon mark shined through at the end there
FREEEEEEEEEADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYY
15:22 Love how marks soul just leaves his body during this cutscene.
😸💞💖💞💖
The put the budget for the ending into the real ending
I think Scott is trying to make it a bigger story that's why it's like ghat
Bruh you can save or did they change it
C'mon, is Freddy calling really that hard? He will run up to the spot you called him and wait for you there or for next call and it cannot be overwritten. So spamming Call Freddy button while running away won't work. Though it is a source of comedy gold, so maybe don't read that, Mark.
I died of laughter when he was screaming, "FREDDIE!"
God I hate stupid programmers
Remember when he used to be king of fnaf? What happened?
Freddy's VA sounds like he'd be a perfect Optimus Prime
This game is disappointing me. Hmm.
there are multiple 2 star endings which are all alternate endings, the bad ending and the true ending
Wa hapun?
this video is so funny i can't stop laugh
Is the rest of the game just secrets? What no..no... I want more
Right at the 11:12 mark I get an ad for that app where the lady is all "10 signs you're addicted to stress" right as Mark started screaming, comedy gold!
You should go try to find Afton's office cuz he's the main boss of it all.
freddy runs to makred location, not player location sadly
1) You got WAY too used to treating Freddy like a dog to follow you around. Press the button ONCE and then stay in the area until he shows up, don't press it a million times while running because then he won't come to your area AT ALL due to AI routing.  2) I think the game is patterned after FNAF Help Wanted, but with a more cohesive story to it. So rather than a single pattern done 7 times, it's about 10 different "games" in one. I think this is partially the effect of Steel Wool having more creative freedom here compared to Scott's style of game. Scott simply doesn't make 3D open-world games, but Steel Wool clearly EXCELLS at it! I really like this game, honestly, bugs and all.  3) I think SOME of the mysteries left over are hold-outs for DLC or sequels. I don't think ANYONE believes this is a conclusion to the saga. It's the beginning of a new story arch in the same universe!
I've had that exact moment when he calls Freddy with my horse in RDR2 Online
1. The theater has more to it (no spoilers) and 2. There's tons of endings!!! Vanny was one you found on accident. - The only bad part of this game is that you can't save your progress after 6am or the fact you never upgraded "Freddy's battery")
28:31  You can feel Mark's betrayal in his voice as Freddy runs past him when he needs him most.
Please continue I like u play FNAF
New ep of inscription soon?
The amount of bots in the comments saying mark channels is trash just really shows how popular his channel is
God bless Freddy
i love it when hes just shouting at freddy as freddys ai breaks and runs right past him that moment is so good thats why i love seeing this game get played
*jumpscares* (lmk if someone’s already done this, i haven’t seen any yet tho)  3:34 7:29  10:45 12:23 27:53 (staff bot) 28:26 (staff bot) 29:14 have a nice day :)
FREDDYYYYYYYYYY FREDDDDDYYYYYY
nice game indeed
Is this a re-upload or did time turn back a day?
interesting
28:42 “not now Gregory, I have to save Gregory!”
So Vanny is clearly Vanessa in a costume. Gregory literally ordered the bots to tear hear to shreds. He is gonna need years of therapy after that. Also Michael Afton was mentioned in one of the previous notes Mark picked up. I wonder if he's somehow involved. That, or William is somehow back. Now I want to play this so I can see the other endings for myself. I have wanted to get it, I think I would enjoy it.
So annoying but, I'll like it anyway😒😵
LOL Now This Is High Quality Content. Love Your Videos There Awesome, Keep Them up.
It's about reich it's about power you stay hungry i devour
Noooo, Optimus Freddy!
Didn't Scott cawthon pass the production of the game onto another party? That might explain why some parts don't match up the way mark thinks they should?
This game is... Tragic
you should play more GTFO
No one's going to say anything about that intro... it's amazing
Bruh, pls get the other endings !
28:19 had quite the delectable suffering to enjoy especially at 28:43 where markiplier had a moment of hope only for freddy to run past him and then wait behind monty to get back down
*game cuts to comic strip* Mark: Did they run out of budget for the ending? Scott: wtf   lol Mark is so shady
This game probably could’ve used a few more years in the oven tbh
Please please do more inscription
Mark sees Freddy coming: "Im safe!" Mark when Freddy went upstairs: "Why are you doing this to me?!"
“A red hare-ing” 😂
Mark you cannot call for Freddy multiple times while moving around, he cannot track you like that and he only moves to the location where you last called for him. Only call for him once and then hide somewhere if someone's after you and then wait, he'll be there sooner or later.
I am in tearssss at Freddy running RIGHT past Mark 😂😂🤣🤣 omg 😂
Freddy: Fuccing dies  Mark: WHEEEEEZE
There are multiple endings to get that reveal different parts of the story. The princess arcade games are a clue to get one ending, you just need to play the first one in order to play the second and so on. Good luck.
His screaming of running away made me laugh so much even the betrayal of Freddy running past him🤣
Watching Mark scream so desperately for Freddy only to watch him run by was comedy gold
Mark, could you please try the "leave" option. there might be another cool ending (one that had the budget)
why is the charging station not working to get rid of moon man though? I've seen people use it for the end before
why does freddy get dirtier as the night progresses
thats poor game design if you cant save after 6am. it makes collecting everything near impossible unless getting monty's claws gives freddy the ability to just destroy the staff bots and his "friends"
freddy finally betrayed mark in that last bit lol
I wonder if mark will go for the other secret endings
U can’t find me because u don’t know where I live :)
Will mark ever find all the secrets..and regain king of fnf…prolly not
This fnaf series never gets old
Freddy betrayed Mark at the end since Mark didn't feel any remorse at the 1st ending lmao
Okey
there is about 5 ish endings
I think Mark said “hi” to every caution sign in this game
Freddy: Fuccing dies  Mark: WHEEEEEZE
I screamed Nooooo when Freddy got torn apart 😫 😭
THIS GAME FUCKING SUCKS WHAT THE HELL?!?!? What...? Like... HUH?  THAT ENDING SUCKED THEY MADE IT A COMIC STRIP WHAT TF
BRUH the burn down the house ending does not make secnce its like like gargaling a snake while chloking on yellow soap while rubbing chesse on your foot fungus toes like there was 2 VANESSAS
"Oh no it's Monty I can't stop him" YOU CAN'T STOOOP HIM, HE IS MONT-GOM-ERY, YOU CAN'T STOOOP THIIIIS MOTHER FUUUUCKER (holy shit balls, holy shit balls!)
Play the game in vannys room
Markiplier is still the king of Five Nights At Freddy's. I love watching him explore every aspect of the game. Especially, figuring the lore. Hopefully, the Five Nights At Freddy's franchise will continue on. Mainly, for the king to conquer them all.
Mark Freddy betrayed u because u did the bad ending soo with no words that was karma
im over here sobbing when freddy said, "You are my superstar." Meanwhile Mark's wheezing
It’s weird that Mark seems to only pay attention when times are crucial and not all the time. If he had gotten in he would have realized the nearly empty battery and probably would have died to Freddy. He also just runs out forgetting that there is night watch patrolling. He constantly does things to get the attention of the animatronics (even though not on purpose). He forgets certain things like not being able to charge Freddy right before the end (even though it says you can’t do that) and forgetting that the path finding of this game is bad and the game itself is filled with glitches and bugs. How about you find the stuff you need to find and then talk about how wonderful the game is once you are done instead of talking about it and getting lost and then losing ALL OF YOUR HARDWORK!!
Freddy: *dies*  Mark: *starts to choke*
Peter Parker: Could you pay me in advance?  JJJ: 11:43
to get the true ending you have to complete princess quest everyone survives in that one. You need to find and complete all three Princess Quest locations. You must beat the first two before 06:00. The Princess Quest minigames are simple 2D dungeon crawlers.  The first Princess Quest is behind Roxy’s salon. The game is in the offices in the back. The second Princess Quest is found in the arcade where Music Man first appears. The games themselves are simple and easy to beat. Now that’s out of the way, you can leave with Vanny.  After choosing Vanny and completing the initial chase sequence, you can choose between the Destruction and Hero endings. After completing the last Princess Quest, all help bots will be disabled. Also, Vanny removes its mask to reveal itself.  William Afton, also known as Springtrap, Glitchtrap, Purple Guy, and many other names, is implanted on the Princess Quest games. Once you beat the games, Glitchtrap’s machines, including Vanny’s brainwashing, fail.
I love to imagine throughout this series when Freddy missed the elevator and you can hear him thumping that he's just running along the wall after the elevator like spiderman
THE WAY FREDDY ZIPPED RIGHT BY LMAOOOOO
The other endings are actually worth getting to in my opinion
"I choose vanny?" Thats my boy! NO MY BOY! Father help!
Haven't lost my shit as hard at a game glitch or really anything similar in so long but holy shit, Freddy running past and Mark screaming was so damn funny omfg
The canon ending is the spring trap ending or something idk I looked it up
5:10
Mark: Click on the links or I will come find you. Me: BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVER!!!!!
Markiplier there are seven endings
28:34 I started laughing uncontrollably
Aparently this game has a lot of glitches dont expect good stuff
Mark, to get the good(?) ending, you have to read the messages on your watch. There are hints about a location in Roxy Raceway which draws a lot of power.
sorry guys scott spent too much money on anti lgbt politicians, he couldnt spare a dime to playtest the game
10:45... That fricken made me jump like fnaf 1
Hahaha freddy running past you and you screaming for him literally has me in tears😂😂😂😂
"There's another ending here somewhere."- Mark   🤘💯😂
Marks humor has evolved into repeating himself thinking it gets funnier
Go into bonni bowling with fready
Tbh more depth in older fanf
The betrayal at the end was like betrayal of Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan, only this time the lava was Montgomery.
IM CRYING  NOOOOOO, WHY FREDDY 😭
Hey Mark, if you go back to Roxy's race way after making it to the exit, you can glitch the game by grabbing the racer head again. And that'll reset the clock making it available to save again and you'll still keep your progress.
I don't understand why you find this game so confusing XD I mean, it's got bugs, but it is what it is at this point. What you see, is what you see. lol There are so many endings it's hard to say which is the "true" ending. I think I know which is the best one, but I want to see what you make of it.
Also make sure you get all the upgrades
Freddy; "You're my superstar" Me: AWWWW Mark: HEUUUUHHHHHHH
So... are these porn bots flooding the comments actually being banned or...?
Not to spoil anything but youwould need to go back to the sewers for the "true ending"
Stop uploading while I’m at work 😭    I’m kidding, like i get it
From 27:54 to 29:22 is true comedy gold. Also, the game is very horrifyingly buggy. I've soft locked my game a few times (had to go to a different save to recover), and it stutters for days, but the game is a gem to play, just... Go to Monty Golf first. Trust me on this one. The fazcam is beautiful.
MARK GET THE SECRET ENDING!!! Choose stay and you’ll see what happens next
Bet you wont find me
This comment will probably get buried, but I think Freddy heads to whatever locations he was summoned to rather than wherever you currently are, so rather than just showing up to your location he'll go to the first place that you called him to
Do the princess quest game 3 times
BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE
I love how mark is here like “hear me out they put out a game with unused areas because they only polished certain parts” Me:…. No there are just multiple routes. MatPat uses the theatre and everything.
dude is it just me or was i laughing to hard when mark was running from monty screaming “FREDDDDDDYYYYYYYYY” i dead ass started dying the entire time 🤣
there are more endings mark there is one you might like as lore wise
mark stop spamming the button- he's going to where u clicked the button 🤕
29:20 Freddy fucked you!
It’s 6 endings in this game
The gift Vanessa gives you is a CD, there are 16 CDs that’ll tell you about Vanessa’s back story
DO IT AGAIN AND THIS TIME GET MONTY'S CLAWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You're right. That's not the true ending
Okay my heart sunked when I saw Freddy get beaten up by the STAFF robots     MAN I SHED A TEAR WHEN FREDDY SAID "You are my superstar"
Vanessa’s voice makes me lose
we all know there is more then meets the eye with FNAF series
I’m looking forward to the compilation of this series
I think because of the pandemic and other thing on in the way plus PlayStation wanted to release and not wanted delay the game any longer then they did… they’ll could work on another patch or big update that adds the things the was left out like he in game models
Best episode yet😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Congrats on number 1 trending for gaming!! Also FREDDY!!
I can't help but feel that Mark is feeling a bit "entitled" to keep his FNAF crown after all these years...how dare a game challenge him?
CocK
while it was hilarious to see him screaming freddy i’m sad with how short it ended up being bc of the freddy bug
Oh goodness, when Mark was frantically weaving in and out of all the doors to elude Monty I was tensed up in my chair peddling my feet in the air XD That chase was intense! Mark yelling louder and louder for Freddy intensified the whole thing. Freddy bolting straight past Mark made me switch to just laughing and grinning for the rest of the video X'D
"They game seems kinda rushed"  yeah, i know why... I KNOW ( ¯ ¨̯ ¯ )
I was laughing so hard when freddy ran past mark like "hey how's it goin, cool alright see ya"
i think we can all agree we cried a little when freddy died.
Man this game is riddled with bugs
And a true ending doesnt exist
i hope there will be moments where they touch on what the actual fuc is going on underneath the building. Very interesting and WANT TO KNOW MORE. if someone already knows pls tell me. also who is vanny.
Only keep watching this game because I just wanna see how bad it can get
FREDDY FRNATICALLY RUNNING PAST HIM THEN GETTING STUCK BEHIND MONTY YALL I CANT--
How to get true ending:   Go down, it’s hidden in case you don’t want to see.  Get all upgrades, go to roxy raceway, there is a door that leads to a place you need monty claws, go through and there’s a door you need chica’s voice box, go down the elevator, and do the rest.
Anyone else confused as much if not more at the end than the beginning..?
That was only one of the endings
hey mark i know you probably wont ever read this but im going through a really tough time rn im going to the hospital for a week bc of this condition i have but watching you play fnaf again brought a lot of light back into my life so just thank you
This game was super intriguing to me! First game I’ve actually been interested in since Sister Location. But like he said, some of the areas feel under-utilized and the pacing is kinda awful when you think about it overall. I loved the sequence in the daycare and in the dance hall! Wish we could have more outstanding moments like that. Honestly there’s a lot I have to say about this game but I just don’t know how to word it!
few minutes later*mark dies* mark:FREDDY YOU BASTARD
I've been reading the comments and I have seen this question a LOT "why is Freddy the only nice animatronic?" In the beggining it says safety mode activate! All unneeded systems for operation are deactivated and put into a sort of subsided mode so Freddy only attacks during repairs and when he runs out of power.
If you go roxys raceway after picking the stay option, you can pick up the bot head from where you first found it and it makes the game think its before 6am and lets you save while still being able to explore/get montys claws
Mark:FREDDAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! Freddy: runs past him to go to monty* XD
:'( freddy look at what they have done with your franchise 😭
Congrats on #1 Gaming Trending where Freddy completely ignored you to die
FREDDY!!!!
No you won’t find me you son of a bitch
When i finally got caught up on the last episode the new one came out and I had to wait till now ;-; but im love security breach man.
Ok but there’s no way I was the only one ready to cry at that “you are my superstar”  I’ve gotten super attached to Freddy due to this series ngl lmao
He just laughed at the ending
Some people have theorized that the animatronic teleportation thing was a band-aid patch meant to counter-act path-finding problems, and then they copy-pasted that AI onto Freddy as well.  It's also why they can open pretty much any door.  It's hard to say exactly what they changed for Freddy, but another big issue was hostile animatronics (plus Vanessa/Vanny) could only find you if you were standing on the ground/terrain.  If you were standing on an elevated object, then nobody could find you.  I'm wondering if maybe Freddy has that same issue?
Mark there are multiple endings
THE WAY FREDDY JUST RAN AWAY FROM HIM LMFAOOOO
MONTY GOLF
It's a shame the game's glitches turned Mark off to completing the game :c
Man, Mark just doesn’t realize the genius of the developers. They made a perfect game at first but then added bugs so that it would accurately fit the lore in how all the animatronics are malfunctioning.      Surely :3
5 ENDINGS MARK OK?
28:43 top 10 worst betrayals ever recorded
Mark have you played Gone Golfing?? I just found out ab it and sounds interesting but I'm missing my favourite YouTube gamer
”you are my superstar”  sorry for the flood guys..
Mark is done with Freddy
Trying my hardest not to laugh out loud at Mark screaming at Freddy! Watching this in bed while everyone is sleeping! 🤣🤣🤣
I guess Mark forgot that Freddy seemed to go to the place you pushed the button, and if he goes to the first place you hit it, then mashing it would only make it take longer. Idk for sure how he’s programmed tho
This game needed another year in the oven
I love this
Good luck finding me I live in the middle of fucking nowhere
The game /looks/ good, but all the endings are cringy.
Game- Recharge stations are offline. Mark- Imma just pretend I didn't  hear that...
28:40 BEST SCENE
love this game but it broke lmao
your supposed to be able to go in the charging station but your game bugged so you got soft locked.
Wait so r u going for the true ending?
youve seen this comment before.....
It was a comic because the game would get taken down if someone saw vannys organs get ripped out by robots
nobody needs to know this but i’m eating roasted and salted cashews while watching this
Yes
this game was very unfinished...
Mark, if you get Monty's claw upgrade, go down the stairs at the Roxy Raceway, the one you found before but couldn't get into, the true ending is down there, and provides some very interesting lore for Glamrock Freddy, i suggest being careful though!
this game is very buggy and breaks a lot so you might be fucking up on what your supposed to do cuse of how much it breaks.
Monty sucks
8:12 Markiplier is totally not a masochist and we are totally not a sadist.
😂 Someone please animate that last scene with greedy and monty!
If you go into Roxy Raceway and re-pickup the broken robot head (it will respawn) you will be able the change the time to 5:15 letting you save, don't worry this doesn't ruin any endings or mechanics as the game still understands its 6am.   If you need proof the game recognizes its still 6am then go very close to a save point after doing the glitch and you will hear the sound affect for the error save but still be able to save
merry crismuh
Makes me wonder if there will be DLCs added to this game.
the yelling is cringe
He goes to the spot you called him at. If you move, it  doesn't matter. He goes to that spot first then the next spot you've called him. It's like a positional queue.
@Markiplier there is multiple ending
@Markiplier , this is not true ending!
24:30 While there definitely were changes to the game and what we could see, the theater area in particular was for eventually getting to Monty. If you had chosen golf instead of the Fazer Blast, you would have missed out on the sewers until you “finished” the game and went back for Chica.
“Good news, it’s almost a COC”
The part when Freddy betrayed you would make a funny animation
Stop fckn screaming and fckn hide!
The fact that Mark guesses exactly how to get the true ending and that something else was going on
Noooo you need the BIG ending mark
I just want to know if going to the stage after you get to the point where you can chose what ending to get works.
I wonder how he can even see through this game I feel so blind everything is so dark T T (it does look better when I watch it on the tv so it might just be my phone)
You should have went for the claws again mark and stayed
Mark: "I know somethings up.... just gotta figure out what the up the something is."  *my new life saying*
Mark: "I will find you."  Me: *Was in the washroom all along*
28:40 freddy booking it right past mark while mark screams at him has got to be the funniest part
You had the chika upgrade and you could stun the moon guy
It sucks he got the worst ending there is soooooo much more to this game when you actually get the other ending
Broskee that Moon man is always makes me jump when he jump scares. He is one of the scariest electronics to me.
the amount of build up for nothing but a fucking silent comic book is insultingly hilarious
NOOOO FREDDYYYYY
Hey guys, I know there's bots in this comment thread that are a nuisance to look at. Report the comments, you'll know when you see. Thank you for doing your part. Continue scrolling.
Top 10 Anime Betr- 28:40
You hate to see it
Bet
28:44  Officially my favorite part
There’s a Arcade Machine in vanny’s office that you can play, it unlocks another ending.
I'm pretty sure the reason he is having trouble is cause Freddy runs to where you pressed the call button and not just to the player (help mark see this)
as soon as mark got to the end and did the vanny option i already started to think of the millions of ways that couldve been done better. like we all did.  xD this game feels like it got jerked into an entirely different direction when scott stepped down mid development. Sadge.  Also i love the edited cuts of mark struggling to figure stuff out because lord knows this series would be long as hell if we had to watch every failed attempted to get somewhere. XP  The absolute screaming at the end from freddy and monty was scaring the hell out of me but also the funniest shit today. Top tier, couldent tell whos stomping was whos. xD
These narrative interjections remind me a lot of Nathan Fillion from A series of Unfortunate Events. I love it so much. Great work Mark! Edit: Patrick Warburton not Nathan Fillion.
Hmmmmm I wonder why the endings were cut a lil short? Maybe something happened in the game creators life, like maybe he got attack by his fans and dint have the heart to finish the game. ~_~
Wait mark, are u done? Like playing this game?
This game is broken and terrible.
28:40 Top Ten Betrayals Of All Time
There are multiple endings, so have fun redoing the entire game
I miss inscription or whatever :(
The intro was so good for some reason
I really want to animate some shorts from this fnaf security breach series 😂😂
mark, how did you forget that the last ten minutes of the game shuts off the recharge stations for freddy as well as the saves?
Vanny lookin kinda cute doh.
Mark the whole video: FREDDY!!!!!!
Is there going to be another video?
Me: *still traumatized by DJMM 'boss'* Pls, there was nothing scarier than this  Part 7: Alternate ending *Freddy dies*   Also me: *NOOOOO HES INCOMPLETE MARK, DONT STOP NOW!!! THE LOOOOOOORE MARK, THE LOOOOOOORE*
Mark destroy monty first and wil be easy for u
Hey I dare you to find and play all three princess quests in a row! The results might surprise you :)
Damn freddy pulled an avatar on mark. When he needed him most he vanished. Lol
18:39 -A "Red Hare-ing" Marks taken the red pill guys, he's on another level of conspiracy that we as mere mortals cannot fathom
my thing is. i feel like Vanessa is Vanny 😳
17:57 wow
22:33 did you notice a circus baby toy
Mark might be onto something about the troubled development of this game, but I do love that his basis for that is that he went to the theater before he needed to go there lmao
In your opinion what fnaf character is the scariest?
hear me out bro…..
My poor boy Freddy, he ain't deserve the hate 😭 It's dumb, but the summon isn't to let Freddy know to go to you, it's to tell him to go where you are, exactly when you pressed the summon button. Then if you spam it he goes to each place individually 😅
I hope this game does well, because while the game itself is disappointing, it has a lot of good ideas that can be expanded upon in a more polished sequel.
You had a laser gun to shoot Monty with…
Oh gosh I really hope we can use this map for some sort of online hangout game.
Well this made my day, Markiplier and a mini YTP in the intro
wow the bugs are straight up makign this game unplayable
I played the other choice and k!lled Monty and you go to the theatre with that choice
what about all the areas that required a level 10 security pass?
What else can Freddy see😏
I CANT STOP LAUGHING LOL 28:40
There is a mission where you kill off chica first take her voice then Monty, then we kill roxy
*Tiny bit spoiler* Some of the unpolished have some really good secrets like for example the theatre has a secret door that you have to do specific things to open
So if I don't press the links, then you'll find me.... Can I get a autograph when u get here?
Hey mark to get the true ending you need two stars each ending has a star get enough endings to at least be able to get the true ending after that find out how get the true after getting enough stars and done see what the true ending has to offer
Imagine how sad this game would be if Gregory was an orphan. They would just be telling an orphan that his family is looking for him
Freddy: dies Mark: *confused wheezing*
first they just fucking tear the absolute fuck out of freggy then  gremgory was like oh shit fedy you died! then proceeds to tell the robots to fucking tear the absolute fuck out of vanetta, then gremgris sad and just "fuck this shit im out!"
This is probably just my theory about what Mark says about the game seeming like there would have been more: I think that when Scott announced his retirement, he gave Steel Wool Studios the notes, but dipped from the project, and, potentially, left out some details that he wanted in the original game. The possibility of the theatre room being part of the original plan is there, but was potentially overlooked due to the shift in management over the series over the course of it's development. Just my thoughts though
What is this song? 7:50
25:15    Well, Mark, Scott did quit (thanks, Twitter), most likely, during development of the game.  Hence, the explanation for the haphazard finish.
Bruhhhh Freddy noooooo 😂 the betrayal!
markiplier:FREDDY FREDYYYYYYY! DONT WAIT UR TURN 3 SECONS LATER monty: jump scares  markiplier: FREDDY FREDDY YOU BASTERD
The reason why Freddy is running all over the place and never comes to you is because he goes directly to where you initially call him from. So it's a little bit of a problem when you're running halfway across the pizza plex and you're pressing the call button 30 times.
Lol he is always saying “Hello everybody. My name is Markiplier” in every parts
MARK. I WAS WATCHING UR PLAYTHROUGH FOR A REASON. WHY DID U HAVE TO PICK THE WORST ENDING??
30 MINUTES THATS ALL?
*cough* don't forget the princess quest stuff you were looking for before
Wait isn't vanny human? does that mean Greg just saw a person get their intestines ripped out?
4:25
GOD i hope this gets animated
feddy just like NOPE
Possible pothole: how do the STAFF know what Vanny is?
The way Freddy ran towards Mark then ran past him towards Monty, I thought he would take him on 1v1. Who knew he's a troller in Security Breach 😂
the reason you die if you go undedrground is because they made it so you cant do the rest of the story while it being  6am or your going far away from one of the exits
The theater gets used if you choose The FazCam over the FazerBlaster.
the editor didn't add any creepy effect or spooky music at the end as Mark is already scarry...
The true ending can be unlocked when you beat all three princess games in order
Ha ha I love the way he called Freddy for help damn that was funny :D
Lmfao Freddy Freddy
Fredddyyyy!!!! Had me dying oh no
I feel like the developers tried something they were not prepared for.  My criticism: Putting a fuck ton of NPCs that alert your position all over the map for no good reason is not fun. Nobody likes this, it just unnecessarily creates frustration when the bots detect you when they shouldn’t. What purpose is there in having 5 janitor bots and 3 security bots in one small room? Then have 10 more bots near that same area. This is a very lazy attempt at creating tension. Vanny should’ve became the new enemy after you destroy the main cast. They shouldn’t return as these weird zombie robots, Vanny should’ve finished the job they failed, it would’ve made her character more threatening. She shows up around 7 times throughout the game, she desperately needed more time.  As I said, Chica should’ve stayed dead. We watched her head get crushed, her ass is dead. There were no real changes to her, she can’t talk anymore and I don’t think she eats trash anymore, big whoop. Vanny should’ve took her place, Chica doesn’t need to be in this game, she’s been in every game so far, give the spotlight to someone else. The endings were kinda anticlimactic. Playing this entire game just to get this very disappointing minute long comic strip that felt very rushed and or half assed. If they were animated like all the other cutscenes it would’ve been fine. My biggest problem with this game, lack of direction. I shouldn’t have to be asking “where am I supposed to go?” or “what am I supposed to do?” majority of the game. I’m not asking for you to hold our damn hand like some people try to argue is what we’re saying, I’m just asking for more guidance instead of “fuck off, find out yourself and don’t get caught otherwise you have to do this all over again. Autosaves? Never heard of it.” The laser gun, oh boy where to start. You first give it to us and tell us it can be used to blind/stun the animatronics, very useful, but you take it away from us after a short pointless segment. Fucking pranked ya, here’s a golden one. What a joke. Saving in this game is a train wreck. Have you ever heard of autosaving? After a main quest is done, it should automatically save, we shouldn’t have to look for a machine to save manually. Maybe put in an option to turn on or off autosave, maybe just don’t have the save stations at all. They make no sense what they’re purpose is outside of gameplay. I can understand the charging stations for flashlights and animatronics because shit needs to charge considering they have hundreds of bots constantly working.  Did we really need another purple guy? Could you not come up with something original or different? Nope, let’s just have another purple guy but this time it’ll be a girl and not purple. Fucking genius.  Things I liked: I like what you did with Roxy after you take her eyes. It changed how to deal with her and she became more of a threat now that she’s blind and very pissed off.  Making Freddy the good guy was a nice change of pace. His name is in the title and he always seemed like a lovable bastard who’s too wholesome for this world, yes, even when he’s trying to kill you.  You did a great job with the futuristic 80’s theme. The animatronics were a bit too smooth for the 80’s but I can look past that. Sun/Moon are fun characters. Not a huge fan on him being able to swim to fly but I’ve complained enough about more bigger issues. I like that you tried taking FNAF somewhere it hasn’t been before. There’s many issues but the fact that you tried is something I like. The game almost feels like an open world. It’s very linear most of the game but near the end when you have higher level keycards you can actually explore giving the game that open world feel it wanted to be. Even is the map was entirely linear, nobody would’ve complained, FNAF was pretty much just sit in one room with some cameras, the fact that you can move around would’ve been ground breaking itself.  I don’t hate this game, I’m just not a big fan of it. It has big problems but at the same time it brings new things to FNAF but tries to bring back old things when it probably should’ve stayed away from it *cough* Vanny and Purple Guy *cough* so they could make something different. If the animatronics were just the bad guys and Freddy isn’t effected by this malfunction I wouldn’t be complaining, but Vanny’s existence as the evil security officer who kills kids just spoils the game for the story.   This wasn’t supposed to be an essay but apparently I got sidetracked. As I said, I don’t hate the game, I’m just not a fan of it. It has so much potential but never builds on it. It’s sad to see this concept pretty much fail.
When mark kept saying “You serious?” At 11:37 my phones Siri randomly said I’m serious
28:44 that's a death scream if I've ever heard one 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I mean there's more endings
NOOOOOOO PLEASE KEEP PLAYING I LOVE THIS SO MUCH! WE HAVE TO KNOW THE WHATS GOING ON PLEASEEE MARK I BEG YOU!!!
Thank you mark you give my life purpose😂🙌🏻
How many times did the game SAY THE CHARGING STATIONS WERE TURNED OFF. And good God the writing in this game was just atrocious. Like... Too much telling instead of showing. "VaNnY... LiKe VaNeSsA aNd BuNnY!" Jesus Christ Scott what happened
Mark screaming "Freddy you bitch" is the best 28:42
You do know that Freddy runs to where you last clicked the button right??????????
mark: *freddy FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY*  freddy: i think i heard mark wet the beddy?
Freddy: "You're my superstar"  Me: *sobbing my eyes out because Glamrock is my puesdo father* Mark: *angry and in denial and on the verge of screaming*
27:53 laugh of a life time
FREDDY YOU BASTARD! Bro shi had me ROLLIN
Ah yes. The classic markiplier screeches as he descends into his hellish rage
guess who turned 19 today woo
So funny when Mark/Gregory is in the theater and sees the duffel bag. Has him jump off the sound story, my legs felt that!
Jesus that ending was worse than I thought lmao so abrupt and weird with the cuts
Me: 0:06
25:07 he just described fnaf's lore lol
"FREDDY U BITCH" LMFAOO
If you spam for freddy he tries to go to all locations you spammed freddy to go for
Does anyone know how to do the vhs effects that markiplier’s editor does when he pauses to talk
I just died listening to him screaming "FREDDY YOU BASTARD"
THE SCREAMING AT THE END IM DEADDD OHMYGODDD LAMHSJAHHWJKAS
King of FNAF gotta get the other endings
This part makes me cry hahahahah: 28:42
can someone tell me how long it took for mark to listen to the voice say the power was offline and the recharge stations would be offline…… yes mark they are serious >_<
I just beat 20/20/20/20 mode I am so happy
Tell him to fully upgrade freddy then leave select stay then go to the elevator shaft in roxys raceway for the true ending plus more gameplay, The happy ending is like I think you have to collect all the collectables then head to the roof. . . I'm not sure. but the elevator that multiple messages talked about draining power and that the raceway kept cracking and stuff that was all aluding to stuff lol.
over 👎 ballsver👍
I love how several people haven't realized that when you call Freddy, he goes where you called him and won't go anywhere else until he gets to that point. So spam calling him makes him run all over and be of no help.
I am adding this video to my favorites and giving it a like entirely due to how it made me WHEEZE in the last 3 minutes of it
as of now this is #1 on gaming trending. Now this is epic
I have never once heard mark scream like that and oh my gosh I was in tears
This game's map size is weird, simply put. So much of the game just doesn't use the map at all and it feels like the devs put most of their time into the map before figuring out what the story and gameplay would be in relation to the map. Then those two aspects were stapled on to the fully featured map, thus resulting in an unfinished story line and unpolished gameplay.
they said there's going to be a Dlc in pretty sure so maybe more stuff will make more sense in it or make us all even more confused than what we already are
I love this series so much.  And even though the last section where Freddy wasn't coming was frustrating to play it was hilarious to watch. Thanks Mark!
I'm sorry but the shitty jumps to the cut scenes entirely ruin this game, I love this to pieces but the cuts make want to cry
I'm very disappointed in this game. It's nothing like the old one's. Poor Mark.
Is it just me or is he doing it on Purpose?? I didn't had the problem in the game that he had and sometimes he is recording a game 2 times or just already know what coles next. It's kinda the worst lets play from him so far.
God these videos make my day, that needing was hilarious
The theater is for if you choose Monty Golf instead of Fazerblast.
Inscryption pls 👉🥺👈
They really did make a game with the absolute worst saving mechanic…
Mark: (calls freddy) Freddy: (walks away)
After having all my wisdom teeth taken out, I can say that I’m really blessed to have had an episode of this series everyday since then. Thanks mark 🤍
27:51 - the end, was literallyu the best part of the whole video. I laughed so hard
Mark: "I don't understand!" Me: Don't worry Mark that's why MatPat exist in this world to explain the lore of FNAF.
from what i understand. the game feels unfinished because it is, which is a huge pity especially considering the clear level of care and love that had been put into this  apparently a before christmas release date was pushed, so large amounts of content were cut from the game and many things were rushed  tbh its one of the better games in the series even in its present state, if it had been developed more i probably would consider it the best in the franchise
I knew as soon as monty showed up it was over lol and then Freddy gave me hope............. and then it was gone lol
Him calling me so many times 👁👄👁
Do not return, it will never be safe... So even if he returns as a patron...it'll still be bad? Sad.
Good news everyone
I can’t do it with the short parts anymore mark I’m dying please 😭😭
That Monty death was completely your fault don’t yell at Freddy
For anyone wondering the reason mark was getting found by moondrop is because being in freddy for some reason doesn't work on moon like with the freddy mask and withered foxy in fnaf 2
I expected one of the endings to be where Freddy turns against Gregory simply because of the upgrades. Freddy talked about his friends like they were important to him and Gregory lied to him about how he got the upgrades and yet Freddy didn't seem to have much of a reaction towards that. Gave me some mixed signals about him
I don’t like the way they force those endings
Me: **shocked** Mark:….Did they run out of budget for the last animation? Me: **losing my sh*t laughing**
what if gregory is the kid in freddy and in reality its just freddy's rouge AI destroying the facillity
Matpat theme intensives
come at me bro !!!
what happened to inscryption??
Mark you kind of oofed yourself on this playthrough because you chose the wrong toy to distract the animatronics and you deserve it for saying golf sucks lol
did Gregory just rip up a human basically?
Bro when freddy ran up the stairs passing mark lmfaooooo literally said "You got this superstar I'm gonna run over here if you don't mind"
I died laughing at Mark yelling at Freddy in the beginning like “GODDAMIT DOG NOT THERE—- IM OVER HERE” literally hilarious
"Freddy..." Dumbledore said calmly.
this game is scuffed and i love it
the mission details literally say you can't use the recharge station
lol i was thinking the same thing as markplier when it came to the vanny ending like lmao, wtf? i feel like there was a budget issue cuz....why the random comic style cutscene?
this is so painful to watch
Its funny how often he asks whats happening while the game is literally showing him
Joke's on you I'm poor and can't buy merchandise
there are more endings to this game also when are you going to finish amnesia rebirth?????? you've finished so many series but not this one
Hello people who are binge watching this in the future
Merry Christmas Mark, I know the gave was a little buggy and confusing but thank you for playing it I enjoyed the play through! I hope you have a good holiday!
You won't see this, obviously... but Merry Christmas Markimoo!
“FREDDDDDDY, FREDDY YOU BISH, FREDDDDDDDY”  Best part especially when Freddy runs right by mark and goes all the way up the stairs. This man saw a bird or something and chose to chase it instead of helping mark
When Freddy betrayed Mark by accident was hilarious Made my night. Lol
Aww. Look like mark isn't gonna do princess quest ;-;
Jumpscare list for those who are too scared  3:34 Moondrop? 7:29 Moondrop? 10:46 Moondrop 12:24 Moondrop 27:53 Security Bot 28:27 Security Bot 29:14 Montgomery Gator
You should know Sunnydrop doesn't get fooled like the other 3
Every other Youtuber's reaction to "Disassemble Freddy": 'Oh, no! Freddy! No, that's horrible!!!'  Markiplier’s reaction to "Disassemble Freddy": *baffled confusion*
i hope he knows he has a leave ending then like 5 stay ending
17:58 same Mark.... same
I just seen Mark google questions, and let me just say that Mark Is the most generous, honest person I've ever met, no need to thank me Mark. :)
community: we love freddy!!  mark: FREDDY YOU BASTARDDD
"You can't sprint."  Moon: Nothing personal, kid.
So, it's called Five Nights, yet you only stay for one?
Can someone help this comment reach mark, he's been spamming the freddy button and hasnt realized yet that freddy doesn't come <to you>, he moves directly to the location you have pressed the button at, that means if you press it at spot A and move to spot B, freddy goes to spot A, as thats where he was signed to. Mark spamming the freddy button is what caused freddy to run past him, while mark was getting his ass vanquished by monty, freddy was moving to every single spot mark pressed the button, in order.
Yae  vannesa  will  scape   from  she    ivel    mind
I wanna see all endings Markimoo.
That's explain why the episode was shrot today
By the way i think u can save after picking the stay option.
29:57 I could be completely off but I think they made it so when you call Freddy, he’ll completely ignore your next calls until he reaches the original destination
Same same Mark !!! We are all thinking the same thing this is nooot the ending lol 😂
#1 on trending again. Goddamn Markiplier!! December 23rd, 2021! Thursday, 9:49 pm.
There’s a glitch that will help him! If you go back and get the drivers assist head again it glitches it and you can save again
This is very confusing.
if you told me 4 years ago that i would be crying over a fnaf game i would have thought you were crazy, but look where i am now 😭
I wonder at what point will Mark notice that Freddy goes to the exact spot you were standing in when you summoned him, and that spamming his call button while constantly moving actually hurts more than it helps
28:40 I CANT BREATH LMFAOOAOAO
Markiplier getting chase by gator markiplier:"FREDDY HELP FREDDYYYYYY" Freddy: *walks past him* Markiplier: "FREDDY YOU BASTAARRRDDD"
Video is mark being confused for 30min
Markiplier NO SPOILERS,  But You missed soooo much. and fwi the theater is reserved for this part. you also missed the arcade game. there are multiple endings. the game isnt over yet.
hint: find the princess quest games
how did mark laugh as freddy tells you "your my superstar"..... Mark do you even have a heart.... you just lost some points there bud
You dont know, that rolling shutter door had his face on it , it couldve been him
Mark, I believe the biggest reason the game feels so disconnected is because the game is partially rushed. Fans really wanted for the game to be out and kept telling Steel Wool & Scott Cawthon to release it (not saying it’s an excuse) and Christmas was coming soon.
Just  stay   pls   not   to  be  sus  man
THERE'S A SECRET DOOR IN THE THEATER UPSTAIRS AT THE VIEWING DECK THAT GOES UP TO THE STAGE!
Is it just me, or does security breach feel like it was released unfinished? Its way too buggy, and some stuff just doesnt make sense.
If you go back to Bonnie’s Bowling Area with Freddy and walk towards the little stage that Bonnie was at (which is now Out Of Order) Freddy will say something sad trust me I looked it up
This episode really brought out the whole "Mark sucks at games" trait. Stop spamming Freddies call button oh my god, it bugs his AI
Are we not talking about the Baby plushie at 22:33?
HELP YOUR OUTRO IS SO FUNNY
ADDED COMMENT: Who else went back 5 different times just to hear Mark scream Freddy's name as Freddy ran right past him?
I hate the vanny ending 😢 poor freddy but all honesty its funny how mark reacts to freddy differently from others i love that
FREDDYYYYY!!!!!
Freddy has become a betrayer at the daycare
There are various endings: Rooftop Dock Vanny Bad Ending is leaving right away True ending Best ending  Forgot which but one of the ending is playing princess quest all the way to three.
I won't lie, you got REALLY annoying this time around, doing nothing but screaming and screaming instead of actually trying to play the game.
“recharging stations are offline” *mark proceeds to keep trying to get into one*
The Vanny Ending is so sad! Like Freddy NO! I can't believe Mark laughed to that. My poor baby Gregory and Freddy!
BURNTTRAP
FNAF Security Breach has more in store for Mark to discover, I hope he does more parts on this.
The more I watch him play this the more I realize that the AI really isn't very good.
I like how Markiplier made an edit to save us the time of him mindlessly dying trying to figure out the way he must go. The new patch that Markiplier mentioned seems to disappointing as it was always neat to see Freddy open unintentional doors 0/
To get the real ending you need to choose “stay” and get Monty’s claws, then you can use Chica’s yell and Monty’s claws at the old elevator and it gives you the real ending. The real ending is awesome.
I mean this in no disrespect, but just bc I’m stupid…. I’m super confused on what went down this episode…. Anyone else feel that?
him screaming freddy annoyed me so much 💀
Freddy: "I'll save you Greg!" *Sees Monty chasing Greg*  Freddy: "I think I left my oven on"
YouTube is so shitty now that every comment has a braindead Indian scammer level of intelligence bot replying to it. Like for real YouTube fix your shit and ban these bots already. If you'll ban people for shooting guns and showing proper videos/training you would think you would ban REAL issues...
ok find me then give me a hug so we can take a selfie so i can have something to show my friends after winter break :3
It's totally sister location underneath Roxy raceway. It's the only one that was underground.
hate to have to explain something overly obvious but Freddie moves to where you summoned him not to you so you running around like that and hime not coming to you was only your fault.
Y'know, it's sad. A lot of this comment section is filled with bots saying: "MARKIPLIER'S CONTENT IS GARBAGE, MY CONTENT IS WAY BETTER" or some crap like that on other comments. And I'm sure that this comment will also get a bot but at least I called it before it happened.
28:38 had me on the floor
Screaming "Freddy" killed me. That shit was too funny
17:58   the game: plays *emotional, SAD* ending  Markiplier: *proceeds to wheeze*
Not sure if you'll see this but you can play the princess quest games
“FREDDY!!! FREDDY YOU BITCH, FREDDY!!”  I DIED.
You still have to finish the episode Mark 😂 Also there’s the Leave Part
do the princess quest ending
Completely unrelated but I hope Markiplier finishes OneShot one day.
28:38  PLEASE, someone animate this part where Freddy just runs past Mark and leaves him to die. XD
Theres another ending
*gets caught by Monty* “FREDDY FREDDY U BASTARD”
Freddy really giving chaotic dumbass energy lmfao
WHEN MONTY WAS CHASING HIM AND FREDDY WAS ABSOLUTELY IGNORING HIM WAS FUCKING HILARIOUS
Markiplier is the only one that I've seen so far that actually listened to Vanessa and went back to the main stage instead of going to the exits first.
Mark: *FREEEEDEEEE YOU BASTARDDD* Me: *LOLL*
24:58 I heard someone say something about how they rewrote the games story at the last minute… it might not be true but it would make sense then that they would rearrange gameplay segments and quote “run out of budget for the ending” lmao
27:53 For Mark to be caught  28:42 For Freddy running from Mark 😂
Mark no spoilers but there is a secret ending that I’m hoping you will find
FIND ME MARK😀
I think Freddy goes where you summon him to, not where you go after. Idk if that's the whole problem, but it would explain the whole running in circles thing being an issue
Every single one if these videos have me rolling!!!  Thank you for always making me smile mark! 🖤🖤🖤
Please come find me Mark.. I'd like to be wanted for once. XD
I really hope that he will go for the secrets and some of the endings.
Finally you made it
No the way freddy said 'you are my superstar' made me so sad☹
I really want to see the spring trap part.
7:36 madeo im heaven
Wow, Freddy's pathing was great in other videos I watched, must have been before the patch! XD
Freddy: "Let us end this." Literally two seconds later: dies I don't know why this sequence of events tickled me so much but it did.
Mark: I’ll come find you… me: okay I hope you do
Ok we need to stop trying to defend this game. It's just bad.
Was the canon ending the fully animated ending?
Well.. you can save
I’m so sad
Mark is a genius! He is purposely doing bad to get more content.
you sped up the night by using the recharge stations :V
If im being honest i would have said “fuck this shit im out” and pressed leave
Some spoilers if you didn’t get all the endings and for people who didn’t really know what was going on and especially for mark who was really confused   For those who are confused about Vanessa/Vanny:  Vannessa (and her alter "Vanny" was under glitchtraps control and was stuck in the Princess Quest game, and by Gregory playing all the PQ games it helped vannessa break free from Glitchtraps control and disable the security bots before they harm gregory; in the rooftop ending when Vanny and freddy fall off the rooftop and Gregory unmasks Vanny who just died, her spirit is seen from the top of the building because she never fully escaped Glitchtraps control, and is now doomed to haunt the Freddy Fazbears Pizzeria
I think there’s 6 possible endings
Noooo only half an hour 😭
"Gregory, good news! It's almost a cock!"
FREDDY GOES TO THE LAST SPOT YOU CALLED HIM FROM!!! FREDDY DOES NOT FOLLOWS THE PLAYER AROUND!!!
Not to break up this lovely series Mark, (which like with everything else you play and/or do, is perfect) but can we get back to inscryption eventually? Like I'm truly addicted to watching you play that game.
The part where Freddy says "Your my superstar" reminded me of the one song called "Pope is a Rockstar" which is the one that says go little rockstar
man this playthrough has me kinda sad. i do think the games a little rough around the edges story wise but i feel like mark rushing through everything rather than using the stealth and cameras + not obsorbing anything anyone says to him in the game kinda ruined his experience. it feels like hes approaching it like its a simple gameplay loop like from the rest of the fnaf games rather than as if it were an open world RPG, which it almost kinda is at times.
theres 5 endings to this game...maybe more not sure
28:47 lmao the screaming that’s funny
So, abrupt cutscene for losing freddy, then comic strip for the vanny bit? Why is this game so inconsistent? It feels like it was released before it was finished.
Didn’t Scott have to leave FNAF because his political view differed from the fan base?
7:34 How The Heck did he Lose!? 💥
There was a princess quest 2 game in the security guard room
Was that episode of Fnaf set in the 1980s 7?!
So Roxy the ability of mom to find anything and then instant
bro this game is so fuckin stupid lmao
28:42 GOT ME DEAD!  Mark: FREDDY!  Freddy: nope, see yah 🏃‍♂️💨  Mark: *FREADDYAAAAAHSUSKSJSaaaAAA!!!!*
So how do u feel about killing Freddy in the Vanny ending, Mark?😭 (I'm jk guys)
Freddy Running past mark when he needed him the most was the start of Marks villain origin story💀
Don't want to spoil the endings but you can read the rest this comment if you want all the endings I know of (Besides the one you got)...     -Upgrade Freddy all the way and find a way underneath the Pizzaplex -Get a level 7 security badge to escape through the loading dock exit. -Leave the Pizza Plex -Play Princess Quest I & II arcade games, replay the Vanny sequence, and then find & play Princess Quest III near the button you press.
They really pulled off an Evangelion "We ran out of budget" moment with that ending
The fact that there are multiple (more than 2) endings to this game is fantastic theres so much story material!
Much big funny tonk you berry mulch
Can u play faz world
The amount of screaming got my ears ringing. Loved this ep though!!
This MIGHT be a beta tester in secret they don't label, but the creators will see the reviews to make it less buggy ext maybe add more stuff like an extra storyline of some sort
I don’t think they ran out of budget for the endings, it’s probably the same as how Fazbear pizzeria made games about the past incidents like FNAF VR.  They probably made a comic about what happened in security breach.
7 Years Ago: "FREDDY DON'T YOU DARE COME NEAR ME"  7 Years Later: "FREDDY HURRY UP AND COME HERE!!"
You can save the game if you go get an  assist bot head from the Roxy driving part.
29:18 I actually yelled the same thing but in Spanish 😂😂😂😂😂
Can't wait to meet you So join the animatronic family We open real soon Try your best to hold onto sanity Come get to know me And you won't wanna leave after tonight Down here, we're lonely And we would love you to join us for a bite You've been through 20 long, frightful nights You've seen their faces, felt all their bites You know our show is so far from over And Freddy told us you're an organ donor All eyes are on you We can walk you through our dark fantasy Learn what we've gone through We can teach you to laugh at tragedy You thought the nightmares ended back at Freddy's We're all still right here, so let's get friendly We're feeling festive Join the party, we'll try hard not to bite Anger is restless Don't hold it against us, we're alright The fun is starting A celebration that lasts eternally I'm always watching Because somebody purple murdered me We'll be found down deep underground What have I done to deserve this damnation? Who knows if you're the one to blame? 'Cause we don't even know your name But you're here now, and we've got temptations We're only playing Just wanted to make a few new friends You plan on staying? When you're with us, the party never ends You might look at me, and think you're going crazy I lost it long ago, you're not alone baby Can't wait to meet you So join the animatronic family We open real soon Try your best to hold onto sanity Come get to know me And you won't wanna leave after tonight Down here, we're lonely And we would love you to join us for a bite And we would love you to join us for a bite And we would love you to join us for a bite And we would love you to join us for a bite And we would love you to join us for a bite
Mark: “maybe there was an issue in development…” *Scott leaving the game midway through due to the controversy*
Mark turned into Michael Afton at the end of the video..  i guess this is what 6 hours of pure & hard Security Breach does to a mf
It's so annoying to hear Mark spamming the "call Freddy" button like it makes him move any faster. All you're doing is resetting the call command to your current location and likely screwing up the already terrible AI Pathing, causing Freddy to spin in circles while you shout like a tiny child.
The fact that this is literally #1 on gaming every episode makes me so happy
This ending was definitely better with him screaming FREDDY
Holy shit, in every comment there's a bot with the "markiplier is garbage" It's so fucking annoying wanting to read the comments and seeing this everywhere YouTube is programmed by a lot of professional freaking retarded people, that doesn't have a single option, for locating the EXACT SAME set of words in the comments to see it as spam and just auto delet it all If there's a bot for commenting shit, there should be a bot for deleting shit even going in the comment and telling yt that that comment is spam doesn't fucking work i tend to ignore it but man, every single comment? shit
Holy sh*t that was most hilarious stuff i saw and i saw a man scream his lungs out in desperation XD
Honestly what worked about the other games was that they had simple mechanics executed well. I appreciate the free roaming but I wouldn’t mind if the game was even mini games/boss battles connected by free roaming bits or something. I think it would’ve allowed more polish and also just dodging security bots all the time gets a little boring
Either the developers left unexplored areas intentionally for future updates or they run out of time 🤔
You should do the head glitch so you can save the game. How to do it is just get the head again from the driver assist for the go kart and it will reset the clock to 5:15AM but keep all of your progress. That way you do not have to be on hard mode when you have the 2nd animatronics upgrade. You also need level 10 security before you can meet with Vanessa.
28:30 I can’t😭😭😭
This can't be the end! will there be a next part mark? 🥺
I just watch part 1 the skipped to 6 and here i am
Teaser: he always comes back...
Having the name Vanessa during this is an experience
What an absolute mess of a game 🤦‍♂️
freddy goes to the location on where you called him, i think?
Hey Mark!  There is more endings and that is one of the endings.
MARK!!! If you want to find the ‘true’ ending, you should perhaps explore underneath the pizzaplex! Good luck!
I swear Markipliers let’s plays are a cure to depression
Im so glad Mark played this game... Saved me wasting my money on such a bugged out game
Markiplier really isn’t enjoying playing this.
There’s an Easter egg with spring trap you have to find a hole that leads down to the old restaurant
0:05
Are you serious?
Just writing this as a reminder to myself and whoever else that reads this that there a more than one ending to this game! I don't remember how many, but I do remember reading that there are more than one.
FFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is by far the most hilarious vid from mark I've seen in a while
If creamlover69 here doesn’t finish this story I will be very sad
10/10 intro
BIG GUD BOI FEDDI
That moment you remember that vanny wasn't an animatronic and she gets disassembled
mark screaming freddy in the highest way possible is peak comedy to me
#1 trending for gaming let’s goooo
Mark has slowly been getting worse at this game and i hate it
ok so first we need an animation now of mark yelling for freddy and yelling at freddy about waiting his turn also, mark you're right, i;ve never clicked the links for distractible or cloak, you said you'll come find anyone who doesnt, so come find me man, you wont, no balls :P XD lmao
"There will be more disappearances" - what disappearances? When did they establish that gregory is investigating disappearances?
PLEASE DO A VIDEO ON WALTEN FILES!!
im not a furry, but vanny kinda thicc
I hope they release like a ‘remastered’ version eventually where they fix up everything and really achieve the vision they seemed to be going for
I kind of want mark to find me!
As of now I would give this game a 5/10. It has a lot of excellent and scary moments but the glitches and how the story fits together in a funky way kinda drag it down. Other than that, it is excellent. The game has amazing potential so I could see updates, bug fixes, and maybe even dlc. The path finding does also need work despite how funny it was in this video. You can tell Scott and his crew put a lot of effort into this game and he deserves recognition for that.  Just a few updates later and this game will be incredible.
It seems to me that Freddy just goes to the spot you first call him from.  So if you call him, then run away calling him constantly, he will ignore you and all your calls until he gets to that one spot.
Amy: a few rooms over quietly relaxing by herself Mark: "Freddy Freddy! Freddy you b*tch! Freddy don't wait your turn!! FREDDY! FREDDY!!
I thought you would fully upgrade Freddy and then be forced to run away from him as his systems currupt and he tries to kill you, you can't hide
Just letting you know if you haven't done it before The laser gun can stun Monty, you just have to hit him in his back
jesus christ man.... mark stop repeating yourself!
Mark hasn't found mmmeee he he ! OUO
I think Mark’s reaction to the end of this game, is the most realistic reaction I’ve seen so far.
Jumpstamps: Put suggestions for improvement down in the comments                    / = For the faint of heart aka minor jumpscares, these include loud sounds and sudden appearances ND = Not a death aka not a game over, these are mainly from security/map bots Bold = Actual Game Over Jumpscares    3:34 / 7:29 / 10:45 12:23 16:03 / 23:09 / 23:18 / 28:26 ND 29:14  Outro: Freddy being dismembered
“fREAAAAADAYYYY YOU BiTCH” Markiplier: 2021
the issue in development was that scott got canceled by a bunch of dipshits that wanted to sate their god complex by canceling random celebs and made him step away from the fnaf dev team
there’s so many bots in this comment section lmao
17:40
WHY IS VIDEO SHORT I NEED IS ALL
There’s 6 endings
omg Mark is overloading Freddy's pathfinding by constantly calling him, that's why he's running AWAY instead of towards. There's too many "come here" requests so the game is discarding some of them, which means Freddy is going to locations that Mark previously was (or gets confused and goes nearby, but not directly there). Stop spamming the button and Freddy will be more responsive! Freddy's not even supposed to be used to hide from animatronics he's used to travel past them, there are hiding spots EVERYWHERE
There is an Afton ending and you do have to get Monty’s claws for that.
Stop spamming the Freddy button and loop the stairs to get in him
WITHIN THE FIRST 10 MINUTES IM SCREAMING BC IT LITERALLY SAYS THE CHARGING STATIONS ARE UNAVAILABLE/WILL NOT WORK AND THEN MARK GETS SURPRISED WHEN HE GOES THERE AND THEY DONT WORK AHHHNSBDJ-
Mark: “FREDDDDYYYYY” Freddy: *runs past him* Mark: *turns into a little girl*
this game makes no fucking sense
I feel like their planning on releasing a multiplayer mode later on once the story modes played out, the whole map is perfect for multiplayer minigames or a dbd like mode maybe 1v5 against Animatronics, that be sick
Most people say that the caretaker or the security bots or Vanny are the scariest things in this game...I on the other hand think its the yellow signs
The issue is that Freddy runs to the point where you were when he's pinged, and not so much to Greg's current location   I assume the other thing they had patched was the ability to unload the entirety of the game by jumping and entering Freddy
There should be an exploit to give you the ability to save again, Mark. In Roxy's race way, go to the spot you found the driving dummy's head. It may or may not be there considering the patch, but if it is, you can pick it up again. Doing so will confuse the sequencing and allow you to save your progress even after the ending decision trigger is activated. It will save you hours of retries. There is no shame with doing this glitch. many others have. Hope this helps.
this comment section is a minefield of bots racing at breakneck speeds to gain the prize of being the ultimate cringelord
I personally think that the comics really fit into the 80s setting and that the devs aren't lazy at all. The devs said(I think it was from Dawko's interview) that the game took inspiration from the team's experience of growing in the 80s. The comic scenes are perfect for me and I don't know why people cringe from it. This is just my opinion so peace✌️.
28:44 Is the highest I've heard Mark scream in a while
Mark asking if they ran out of budget for the last animation is funny. It's just one of the many endings that didn't get a full, 3D animation because it's not the "main" ending.
When mark calls Freddy and he just runs towards him all I can hear is mrs. doubtfire shouting: help is on the way dear
Knowing that mark has only gone through 46% of the game is something neat
Why did I have the strong feeling Mark would get one of the WORST endings first...?
GOOD NEWS. IT IS ALMOST A 🐔!
"hmm I'm in trouble right now. I'm going to spam the summon freddy button constantly moving him around and behind me as I run ensuring he never can catch up. I'm also never going to consider looking for a hiding spot"
SPOILER ALERT!! READ IF YOU WANT TO KNOW!!   I just found out Vanessa and Vanny are two different people apparently from an ending where Pfinesse is on top of the roof while Vanny is dead on the floor with Freddy who looks kinda like Vanessa
I feel bad for Roxie I would try to comfort her even knowing that shed would kill me before it
28:41 the comedic timing when freddy shows up at the last second just to run past you like u dont exist lmao
I think Mark’s complaints come down to this: FNAF does not need any more games, but the unfortunate popularity of the game means that they will push out an unfinished pile of nothingness just to be able to slap the “FNAF” title on it, because people feel they need a new installment of FNAF, which they don’t. This series should have finished a while ago. This game is unfinished and extremely incoherent, the story is a mess, the gameplay is nonexistent, and the jank is off the charts. Its a bad game.
Mark not remembering that the recharge stations are offline and then saying are you serious over and over again hurt
There somewhere a robot head take it glitch then you can save
LOL
I hope Mark collects all of the CDs because that gives a LOT of backstory. That and I hope he plays all of the Princess arcades because that gives a different ending also after beating the last game.
I love how Freddy just ignored you on the stairs.
FNAF 7 years ago : No, Freddy DONT you come near me FNAF today : Freddy, come here Freddy!
MARK PLEASE DO THE TRUE ENDING
I love markiplier I will never get sick of him oml
Mark I dont think you realise what happened with the game. It always "ends" at 6 a.m, no matter what. When you complete missions it pushes time forward but you dont need to complete certain missions to finish the game its more so you only have 6 hours to complete missions.
I love how Freddy just runs around like a dog amidst Gregory running from Monty LMAO.
I speak for everyone when I say I feel sorry for Mark with all the stupid bots in his comments. Reading what people want to say about your content used to be fun but now there are too many bots for that to be a practical idea.
nOICE MARK
So if you leave with Vanny and Freddy in the 3-star ending then what happens with Afton bc we see that he can clearly leave his station by will now and Molten Freddy can just bring him to the surface of the PizzaPlex (also the place they were buried under was the canon Pizzaria Simulator, fight me about it, Lefty was the only one not shown in this game from Pizzaria Simulator)
Was anyone else annoyed that he didn’t just go straight to the exit 😂
I feel like mark is the only one that isn’t sad about Freddy dying because he’s the one that’s been tortured by him the most 🤣
There are six different endings to this game so make sure you get them all Mark!
Nice
can't wait for the decommission monty thing
there are multiple endings markimoo, gotta find em all!
FrEdDYYYY!!! WHy
Harry Crabnest Mark, and a new year that might be better than the previous one
FREDDDYYYYYYY 😂
i swear the last few minutes got me dying like damn Freddy really juked mark so bad 😭
I would actually be quite honored if Mark were to come find me, to be perfectly honest. Even if it was only to deliver a flying punch to my face and walk away.
Freddy man he’s just being polite and waiting his turn, what a role model!
WHY DID IT RANDOMLY GO INTO A COMIC 😭
This game looks unfinished. Which is really sad ‘cause all the other games were basically all put together and complete. I know this was pretty uncharted territory but it’s such a shame so much seems to have been left half baked
The robot head in Roxy raceway is glitched and when you get it the second time allows you to save
Ok but Mark playing this game is so amazing due to the frantic screaming of all the jumpscares and the pressure. I could never imagine myself playing this because of the nerves it strikes within me just watching Mark play it.
I'm not clicking those links so mark can find me and give me a fist bump
The way that I've seen everyone who got the "vanny" ending say the same thing about the comic strip💀
That last death is your own fault, I think - you kept on spamming the "Call Freddy" button as you ran around instead of just going to the place you told Freddy to meet you.
I could be wrong but it looks to me like Freddy isnt running to you but to the location that you were in when you called for him.  If you notice when you call for him constantly in different locations, he goes and investigates all of them to find you........but i could be wrong though
At the end there i had only one thing in my head: YOU RUN AROUND! I RUN AROUND! WE ALL GONNA RUN RUN RUN AROUND! YOU RUN AROUND! I RUN AROUND! WE ALL DO A RUN RUN RUN AROUND!
No one:  Me: Mark's cry of anguish: FFRREEEEEEDDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I was watching this while laying down on my stomach and my back hurt, I jumped at 10:44 because of the jumpscare.  I'M IN PAIN!
That one staff bot was the scariest jumpscare in the whole game
Game: Charging stations are offline Mark: TIME TO GET TO A CHARGING STATION
There is a fazcam that you missed, remember when you were getting the lazer? Well there was the other option of the camera, so maybe Giuseppe can try and get that
Pressing Q summons Freddy to your location at the moment you pressed it. That means if you press Q at the top of a set of stairs, he will run and stop at the top of the stairs, even if you've run down the stairs while he was running. He also seems to have some sort of queue with the presses themselves, meaning he won't listen to any Q presses until he's at the location of the first Q press. Taken together, I think they intentionally balanced the summon so you can't abuse it to get out of chases easily.   The summon isn't broken, it's working exactly as it was designed to.
oh my god, mark thinking he was safe and freddy just dipping past him on the stairs had me fucking dying. also princess quest games for the real vanny ending :3
There are other endings:  1. Normal Ending: Just leave at 6am  2. Disassembled Ending: The one Mark achieved. By choosing Fazerblast, and then choosing to go after Vanny at 6am  3. Good Ending: Choose Fazerblast, but then play the three Princess Quest games in order (1 in Glamrock Roxy Salon, DJ Arcade, 3 during the Disassembled Ending). This will them trigger the Good ending  4. True Ending: Stay after 6am and get all the upgrades. Once you get Monty's claws, go to the back left door in Roxy Raceway (the chained gate Mark found earlier) and go down the elevator. After this is the point of no return (note, you can save after 6am if you choose to stay).
MAN, new comments dropping every 5 to 6 seconds
I hate the story. The lore is all over the place. Who is Gregory? How did he get in? Why is he in there in the first place? And whenever Gregory disassemble Freddy's friends and pretend it was an accident. Cool game, but it just feel rushed and it doesn't make any sense.
is it just me or is this series one of the best series mark has done? the at dead of night series was amazing too, no doubt about it, but it just doesn’t hit the same way this one does, yk? all of marks fnaf series r incredible and they always put a smile on my face !!
Mark in the outro: I will find you..  Me: well unlike Freddy you appear to have eyes that work
It could be because fnaf had to let go of scott mid producing this game. With the controversy surrounding him and everything has to be cut short?
Freddy just ignored George. LoL I think Freddy runs to the spot you called him, and not directly to you. He's got new eyes and ran right past Mark. 😂😂
the “game” is very underwhelming. the lore is good tho
U wish stay
Security Breach has many endings Mark boy.
This game feels less like a game and more of a lore dump
The first time I’ve ever watched Mark was when he played FNAF 1. Seeing how far Mark and the FNAF series have come after 6 years is insane.  28:39 The way Mark screamed after Freddy ran past him had me crying😂😂😂
I’ve never been more lost in a fnaf game which i feel is really saying something. I dont know why gregory is staying overnight, why freddy is the only nice animatronic, why vanessa is the way she is and everything about vanny. In every other game i had at least an idea of what was going on with the extra details being the stuff thats held back but this feels like whole plot points are being hidden for the sake of multiple endings
It was a good run. But insanity got to mark. So long Markipauser.
Mark complete forgot the recharge station is disable after installing the eyes
This game had so much potential. I’m sad it was rushed
If you go to Roxy Raceway then there is a glitch where if you get a driving bit head you can save the game during the endgame
Does FANNY stand for something?
WHEN I TELL YOU I LOST IT WHEN HE WAS SCREAMING FOR FREDDY-
Ah danm it, you got that ending  Mark, you remember how to get the true finding in sister location? Yah this game does the same thing except instead of turning right in balura galary you bust through A gate and go down to the place from Freddy fazzbear's pizzaria simulator
good
Really doesn't seem to be much of a fnaf game tbh. You got a few scenarios that hit the panic gameplay that the older games thrive on, but besides that it looks like an overly big playground with too few threats. I think you were spot on when you said it looks like they put more detail into the environment but then dropped the ball on the actual gameplay.
I can help you with the secret/true ending on roxy raceway there is a door that takes underground you will find all the funtimes and with freddy to avoid them but you"ll need the voice box and the monty raws to enter thwre
Me: *crying cuz Freddy died* Freddy no....   Mark: *wheezing noises*
Mark you should try to do the true ending  you would enjoy it
Wow, how did I not catch that?  Red hare-ing=red herring  Bruh
There isn't a true ending to the game however, there are a variety of endings you can complete in order to understand the story better, including an  alternant ending with Vanny (you need to complete all 3 princess quest games in order to get the alternant ending with Vanny). The closest thing to a true ending occurs after you chose to stay and decommission  Monty, from there you will use the three upgrades to reach an elevator and head to the end of the story (once you go down the elevator you can not go back up, so make sure you don't want to go anywhere else before going down )
The bots really need to stop now-
Honestly kind of disappointed, I thought Vanny was going to be more important than it seems she is. That Vanny ending was really confusing and paced weirdly, I hope Mark can get whatever the true ending is!
"FREDDY YOU BITCH!!!!" had me fucking crying
This game was so worth the wait!
There is 5 more endings but I only know how to do one. To get the Canon ending you have to get Monty's upgrade for Freddy then go back to Roxy Raceway . In the raceway on your left when entering is a door leading down. You can open the gates when you have Freddy's upgrades. Once you do that take the elevator and enjoy
hey there is more endings you can get
Have you ever thought of editing YTPs before? Those first few seconds were prime YTP material.
Love this video so much!...Happy Holidays!...
Mark is so frustratingly entertaining
I don't think this game is ready yet lol
SPOILER KINDA: the theater is if you get monty's claws path, you need to get the mazercise key from there
Are you laughing wheezing or crying when Freddy is dead? 😂🤣😂
Mark doesn’t even realize he’s Locked out from the true ending since he never did the 2 princess games before 6am when he could have done the 3rd one in vannys hide out and unlocked the true ending.
Don't Get mad at him he got stuck 6:20
Markiplier sounds like a disappointed father. "Freddy, don't wait your turn."
That ending and the glitches show this game was severely rushed into getting put out. There are SO many places that could be explored yet off limits. And yeah, nothing was really explained. Very short as well. Maybe I'm just too picky 🤣
I haven’t clicked on the links, sorry mark.
All of the endings except for the “true ending” has a  comic book style cause they aren’t real or cannon
I literally died when Freddy booked it past Mark when he needed him the most.. 😂😂😂
there are more endings you can unlock and the game has cheats i think
This game is like 70% frustrating aimless empty wandering, 20% jank and 10% competent gameplay with well programmed mechanics.   So, its pretty bad.
FREEEEEEEEDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
28:41
I love how it went from emotional "you're my superstar" dying Freddy aw. To manic anger yelling calling Freddy a bitch.
Bad children must be punished.
PLEASE STAHP SPAMMING THE PING BUTTON 😂. Each time you press it, Freddy attempts to find a “better” way to get to you.
VANESSA
The endings in this game are just garbo!
0:03 There wasn't an intro yet. ------- 28:38 I need my emotional support Freddy here!
I think we can all agree that the Part where Freddy is chasing Mark, is the best Part xD Mark: FREDDYYYY YOU BASTARD! Freddy probably: You Superstar
Go little rockstar
Day 5 of being early 💓💓
I can't get In Freddy
I think the weakest part of this game story wise is the pacing of the endings. They all just kinda... happen. That suited previous games, since the narrative was pretty bare bones, but this one is much more cinematic.  The endings all feel pretty unsatisfying and jarring.
Never have I ever felt sad for an animatronic     Never mind
You can go back to Roxy Raceway and pick up the robot head again. It’ll spoof the game into thinking the time is 5:15 and you’ll be able to save again, and still do every post game thing (explore freely, pick up gifts, upgrade Freddy, etc.)
My god this game is broken lmao
Markiplier, without spoilers; You can get two endings that are better than the ones you got. The BEST ending: Go play Princess Quest 2, then do the Vanny choice again (either at the door or at the loading dock) then play it normally and play Princess Quest 3 in Vanny's room to get the ending. Canon ending: Do Monty to get his upgrade for Freddy, then go back to Roxy Raceway. In the raceway on your left when entering is a door leading down. You can open the gates when you have all of Freddy's upgrades. Once you do that take the elevator and enjoy
this game sucked all the way till the end
Uh... about a minute in, I'm getting static. It's not from me, because my external speakers and 3 headsets are getting it too. Unless everything around me is breaking simultaneously. Knowing my luck with electronics recently, I'm feeling like Allen Grant... can't get near crap with it breaking or having a nuclear meltdown.
How does Mark not realize he would be a lot more successful in the chases if he stopped spamming the Freddy call?
The end was... yeah... Well... was not what was I thought.
28:44 the best moment 😂😂😂😂😂
That intro made me die laughing
Markiplier and Freddie’s relationship is hilarious.
The intro was chaotic
FREEEDDDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYY???!!!!!!!!
28:40 TOP TIER COMEDY RIGHT HERE 😂😂😂😂
I hope this game gets updated with some story tweaks and some very big bug fixes
Wait till Mark figures out there are like 5 endings 😂
FREEEEEDDDDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYY
As 28:45 I was watching this my friend called me telling me the Monty in George’s stuffed toy from Peppa Pig and he had no clue I was watching it
FREDDY RUNNING PAST YOU TOWARDS THE END FUCKING KILLED ME LOL 28:40
go back and pick either leave or stay, staying has alot more gameplay and as far as i have played, it doesnt suddenly end
mark remember, there are multiple endings like MULTIPLE 😂
the pacing in basically this entire game is really strange... i don't get it. *especially* cutscenes
"or maybe something went wrong" Yeah... something DID go wrong during the production
What’s with the sudden tone change with Freddy? Did I miss something? Did mark go back and change his path? Cause I thought Freddy didn’t want any upgrades :/
26:40 the game is played in different ways i think, cuz i sa Dantdm's video that he used the theatre for something important
Did they segregate the credits lol, all the Latino names were after the white names and in yellow
No autosave after the eye surgery? That's... Just terrible game design.
I feel like this game was supposed to be much faster paced
28:41, god damn you got freddy jukin us. went from about to beat the shit outta monty to running away so god damn quick.
NY HEART IS FUCKIN BROKEN AND MARK SUDDENLY BECAME A CAR ENGINE ☝️😭
I have tears from the final chase scene. Oh my word. XD
Okay so..beautiful game but uh..it’s kinda trash 🗑
MARK,IF YOU LEAVE IT'S AN ENDING TOO
At this point I think maybe just maaaybe Mark has had just about enough of FNAF and *fNaF lORe*...    Lol nah.
There is a secret ending near an exit, there is a pit hole where the old pizzeria was and springtrap comes back
Wooooooah my theory was way off skdjfkkffkl
If Freddy is like that when he’s disassembled- Vanny is human in a bunny suit then.. Jesus that’s gory and the worst way to go
Freddy running right past gregory being who is chased by monty is now my personal head-canon
Gamers react channels crying because marks reaction to important events is just 😦
Mark: goes on rant about areas not being utilized me: smiles knowingly
@Markiplier , Roxy’s eyes can reveal hidden doors all around the complex. Let no hallway go un-sleuthed.
Mark try to find Aftons office
...there's 7 endings- :3c
not gonna lie- the vanny ending is definitly SUPER rushed lmao
It could’ve been avoided if he hid in the bin in the theatre, but Mark screaming for Freddy while mashing the summon button and playing ring around the staircase with Monty was cinematic perfection.
MARK YOU CAN SHOOT THE EYES OF THE STAFF BOTS, YOULL NEED IT MY DUDE
Good news got me so good
Mark, it’ll take you a while to get to the “real” endings Spoils to how you get them:         1. Go to find every Princess Quest machine and then get to Vanny’s room and beat PQ3. I consider this one of the “true” endings. 2. Once you get to Monty and steal him arms, go under the facility where they said that there was a weird area underneath the pizzaplex it’s basically a classic fnaf style boss fight. Stuck in a room until a timer finishes. This is probably true ending 2 3. Get most collectibles and chose the leave option (there is a variety of secrets leading to the last ones such as the foxy poster secret door) 4-6? Exiting through different exit doors cause different endings (“true” ending 3)
Anyone else not hit the link in hopes that mark comes?
fred goes to where u called him it looks like not where u are
17:50 *sad death scene w/ depressing music*  Mark: *WHEEZEEEEEEE*
Hey Mark, if you get the staff bot head again you will be able to save. It's probably some sort of glitch but it'll make it easier to get the real ending
There's supposedly 5 discovered endings to the game so far. and people kind fell like there's possibly more that are hidden, or yet to be implemented. A lot of us are watching for more of the possible endings still to expand.
Hi markpiler
Lord knows this game isn't perfect, and definitely should have had at least another month or two of work before being released.  But Mark, when you continually ignore what the game is telling you - including VERY SPECIFIC instructions and information, such as the recharge stations going offline - you don't have a right to call the game confusing. You've barely paid any attention since the first episode, and it shows, because out of half a dozen people I've watched LP this game, you've had the worst time by FAR.
If you go to where you first got the assist driver head; you can pick in back up again, and it should allow you to save again even after you have beaten the game, and you chose to stay...at least that's what Ryan did in his video
markiplier watch horror bro hygeia dissemination that video is fine so freddy's
Can you make  part 8 pleases pleases
That time when Monty is chasing Mark and Freddy just pass by him hahahahaha
I wish Mark got the ending where Freddy and the kid get out together, but the superstar ending is good too just super sad
28:43 😂😂😂 highlight of the series
When Freddy just bolts for it
The amount of Jumpscare Here is                ✨Unhealthy ✨ But It is worth it 😉
ok, im stopping real quick at 18:48 to predict that the comic book style is a way of showing that, that ending is not the official/ canon ending. its a comic book, its made up and written for others to see. its not the regular animations that we have had through out the rest of the game.
The game repeating recharging stations are offline like ten times followed by mark complaining that recharge stations are broken multiple times is far more infuriating than it should be
I think Scott basically being forced to leave the development of the game it was left not totally finished and ends up hurting the game
Mark forgot something in the theater.     (╥﹏╥)
look at the arcade machine in vannys room it willl unlock  new ending
....Mark seems like a generally intelligent person, but somehow he still hasn't figured out how Freddy is summoned. He has never been summoned to wear you are, but where you clicked the button. Yelling at Freddy for doing what he's always done....just makes you look like a bit of a doofus there Mark.
29:15 FREDDY, ¡COÑO’E TU MAAADREEEEEEE! HAHHAHAHAHHAAHHHA
This suffering has earned a Like  👍 from me🙃
I was writing a letter to my fiancé for his lunchbox and I dropped my pen from laughing so hard at "FRRREEEDDDEEEEHHHHHH!!!!" 🤣
In all his videos of security breach I never heard him curse at all. This is way too funny than his previous videos (his other video are funny but this kicks it)that is pure betrayal 🤣 😂 😆 I broke out laughing when he said B**ch that got me there🤣😂😂🤣😂
I really wish mark could make extended cuts of his games where he didn’t cut out the replays. I love the edited version with the comments and cuts, but I’d love watching the full recording.
The last part was probably hinting a book
if only you could hide in ths game...
Mark there's another Vanny ending that you miss, the princess quest arcade games right, Well there's 3 of them. first one is in Roxy raceways, explore and try to find a restaurant  there, enter it and find it, the second is in the DJMM section, and the third is in Vanny's hideout when you trying to get the button to disassemble Vanny. Hope you find this.
DUDE STOP CALLING FREDDY THAT MUCH HE WILL NEVER REACH YOU
Game: *says recharging stations are disabled* Game: *says to get out before 6am* Mark: This sign can't stop me because I can't read!
mark doesn't realize that freddy doesn't come from where he was last but where the closest place he can come to you is-
Now play the game without save points.
Lmao seeing Mark frantically yelling for Freddy is funny as hell. 🤣
Wow This Game Actually Ended Up Sucking
The theatre is for montys parts
*Don't Worry About Bonnie. He Went Southbound.*
9:26 vanessa sounds suspicious
I like how Youtube felt it was more important to remove the dislike counter than to deal with the literally dozens of spambot comments (ranging from normal spam to plugging malware) plaguing every popular video.  God forbid they, you know, have the faintest bit of competence.
If you recollect the head at Roxy raceway it resets the time to 5:15 and you can save again I did it and it worked
I'm glad you know I didn't click those links.
Could you imagine if this complex was built, this thing would be huge!
Have to agree, the game doesn’t feel... finished?
Checked out Skyrim Anniversary Edition yet?
29:24 Markiplier is going insane for the third time
The fact Mark can’t really swear anymore due to his audience or sponsors/Ad’s…  Ruins the fun of watching him play fnaf… very disappointing but still entertaining because it’s Mark!
Just a heads up, Mark, there's like 6 endings
Nothing is better than Mark making confused noises about situations because he didn't pay any attention to text on the screen. End of the last video it literally said moondrop was on the hunt and that recharge stations were unavailable. Never change Mark.
When Freddy ran up the stairs at the end! 😆
I normally don't comment but binge watching all these episodes has been nice, I had to be rushed to the hospital and found out I have pneumonia, I've been stuck with so many needles. Your videos are a great distraction from the pain, thank you so much!
I wonder if there’s gonna be another Security Breach for the other endings, bc Mark likes to get the lore, but not really dig in like some others of us🤣
I swear he better get all the endings. I really hope he does do that
Hide n seek champ 2019 and counting... WTF is Distractible? Good luck finding me Mark.
I keep sitting here saying, "USE A RECHARGE STATION YOU IDIOT!"
freddy: dies Mark:🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎🕈︎☟︎☜︎☜︎☪︎☜︎
im sad now, when freddy said "you are my superstar" i heere theories that if bonnie was removed, that he would be "superstar bonnie". so freddy calling gregory his superstar is like his best friend.
the thing is that there are multiple endings
So how bout that crown
I'm honestly kinda getting sick of mark not paying attention to the game. It's the reason I stopped watching Jack he missed the most obvious shit.
The easy way to not die is to NOT WALK INTO STAFFBOTS!!!
What Freddy does is run to where you called him from. If you move from that spot or try calling him again he’ll still continue until he’s reached the first place you called him from, even if he’s stuck.
This entire video is just one big brain fuck
"You're my superstar", my heart broke in that scene
Teleports behind you "it's past your bed time"
“I’m done” no you’re not, play until you figure it out for yours and our curiosity
Is it just me or does Vanny do super-exaggerated movements in her cutscene?
This game is so broken, but somehow it adds to the experience when you aren’t the one playing it.
Best game to watch geeked asf 😭😭
Excited for part 8!
There’s actually more bosses in this game
17:49
is there going to be another part or this the last??
because u miss the camera for stun
mark they told you last episode the charging thingys were down yet you keep trying to get into one 😭🤣
mark there is another more endings that you need to discover one of them is bretty intersting :)
For some reason multiple YouTubers question why they can’t get in the recharge station. Only cause they didn’t read the instructions that said they don’t have access to them
00:10:41 Mark is amazing! I haven't seen anyone get that yet and nothing comes up on Google yet. That could be the start to figuring out what is happening.
Loading Dock exit?
God damm u shout so loud
Freddy be running up the stairs with 0 hesitation to rush Monty face first while ignoring the signals from Mark.
“I know there’s the true ending somewhere around here” literally standing right beside the elevator for the true ending
u need to defeat monty  and afton   and u have even others 3-4 finals
The climactic panels of vanny being ripped to shreds while freddy is slowly dying were too funny
Seeing that alternate ending that Mark first chose really hurt, man. Freddy may be broken at times, but he's just a wholesome robot friend. A real good guy who I like a lot and brings joy and just wants to be your friend (never thought I'd say that about Freddy himself but here we are). He's very much the "If anything happens to him, I'll kill everyone in this room and then myself" meme.
hey mark, i know you’ll probably never see this but thank u for being around for so long and making my life better for so so many years. i feel like ive practically grown up w u, and i truly appreciate everything that u do.
Roxy vision sucks! You can barely see anything! It would make sense if you had it when inside Freddy and not have when outside him. The effect is just too strong to see properly.
nO- im not CRYING... *sNiFf* FEDDYYYYYY NOOOOOOOOOO
I love watching him spam the "summon freddy" button because it seems like it puts all the locations he was at in a sort of queue that freddy HAS to visit each one before moving to the next
watching mark panic and lose his shit because of freddy not coming to his aid while monty chases him is pure comedy gold. seems like this is freddy's revenge after you laughed at his death scene earlier mark pfft
i like how mark forgot the game told him recharging stations won't work anymore    can markiplier to get the save vanny ending hmmmm
bro this game looks trash
This game really is a buggy mess. And wtf was that extremely abrupt Vanny ending?
i hope he knows that there are 5 endings
freddy going in every possible wrong direction and ignoring mark is giving me life
GO TO THE ELEVATOR IN ROXY RACEWAY. YOU HAVE TO TRAVEL DOWN SOME DARK STAIRS AND NEED ALL UPGRADES. I PROMISE YOU THIS WILL CHANGE EVERYTHING.
And ther is a secret room wher you have to shoot like standing pictures
Moondrop is now a pro NFL football player 3:25
Markiplier do better if u want to stay as the king of five nights at Freddy's 😐
>can't enter recharging station >mark: "aRe YoU sErIoUs?? >game: yes, freddy told you they would be off line before the final hour
12 seconds in and losing my shit Mark you can't just do that to me lmfao
15:30 excuse me?? I- I was not prepared
i just am amazed how well mark knew the lore compared to youtubers who have also played every game and didn’t call it out like mark
It seemed like Freddy was going to each spot you had clicked before consecutively before reaching the most recent one by you, so you have to stand by the spot you last clicked to have him actually come to you?? I could be completely wrong and he is just losing his shit 😭😭 those eyes make him see so much man is having an acid trip trying to find Gregory
When he was screaming Freddy I was laughing so loud
Mark: Ignores pop up Also Mark: why can't I get on the charging stations when the game tells me to leave?! Mark: Spams button to summon Freddy Also Mark: Surprised when he keeps going to where he last was summoned instead of his most recent location. (Broke Freddy my ass Mark you just don't understand how he works.) Mark: Sees the incredibly sad ending that made everyone else sad Also Mark: Wheezes and is confused.
28:30 Mark: FREDDY!!!! FREDDYYY!!!! FREDDDDDYYYY!!!! Freddy: *Walks straight past Mark and Monty like they’re both invisible* Mark: FREDDY!!! FREDDY!! YOU BlTCH FREDDY!!!! Monty: Hey Little Guy Mark: FREDDY!!! Freddy: continues to walk slowly down the stairs like a gentleman behind Monty. Mark: Freddy.. don’t wait your turn😤 Monty: *chases down Mark & eats him alive* Mark: FREDDY YOU B%ST@RD!!!🤬😩 Freddy: You are staying? I’m glad! 😄 This had me in tears😭😂😂
Man, this game really is an interesting concept wrapped up in a fucking mess, huh...
There is more then one ending mark, Just letting you know.
the number of times mark said “are you serious” in one video must break a world record
First, I was surprised that chicas face wasn’t burned into his computer screen. Then it was the blaster, then the STAFF bots face, and now it’s just the game over screen.  I will say it over and over again, but it seriously happens every time. I’ve made basically this same comment from ep 3 (?) to this one. Not even joking.  It’s ok we are all idiots sometimes :)
“FREDDDY YOU BITCH….FREEEDDY!”
Moxey. Clause and upgrade Freddy
You know what, it actually isn't the worst looking game in the world.  But damn, they should have waited to release it.  Maybe they genuinely couldn't find problems when they played it, maybe there's other reasons it's like this, who knows...   Anyway, it's a pretty nice game, nice visuals, good animations, the music and voices are amazing, and let's not skim over the replayability ​with the upgrade tasks and such.  The story is a little confusing though, but it gets the point across for the most part.    Honestly, it was still an enjoyable series to watch.
What happened to all the glorious lixian eddits they would add so much to this series
Mark: FREDDY!!!! Freddy: completely ignores him because he’s wearing airpods blasting the games show theme
THERE'S MORE THAN THAT
MAKE PART 8 PLEASE ❤️❤️
why would you pick VANNY
I get what the developer is trying to do with the "You can no longer save your game!" But it just feels like a rushed way to not have people see their shitstorm of an ending that I am sure is coming
MAKE 8!!!!!
28:40 funniest part in the series
Honestly this game is so underwhelming and its such a shame. Marks probably expecting some big thing for the proper ending but tbe cutscene there is just as long, if not shorter than the fazerblast one
Alternative title : FREEEDDDYYY!!!! FREEDYYYY!!!!
MAKE PART 8!!!!!!!
Do it find me u wont
There are 6 total endings I think to this game
"I will find you." Doubtful if you couldn't even find Freddy 🤷
FREDDY YOU BASTARD!
Since this game had a delay, the Vanny ending definitely was rash to meet the deadline.
man they gotta fix freddy's pathfinding
I think the tearing apart of Vanny would’ve been too graphic lmfao, probably why they went with the comic book instead.
Every single episode of this has featured mark making a fatal mistake at some point and paying the price
Mark: “The bulk of which I will save you from but will show you a little bit because I know for some reason you enjoy my suffering…”  Me: Thanks Mark
i literally couldnt breathe when freddy ran past mark up the stairs and just completely ignored him as he ran from monty
AH YES PANIC SPAMMING. THAT'LL HELP.
This game was NOT ready to come out
im wanderin what he is going to use for the thumbnail next, he used everyone
I hope you're trying to figure and try all of the ending as many as possible please
“Mark curses out Freddy with his dying breath” I see no better way to die.
What mark hasn’t realized since the beginning is that freddy shows up where you called him not where you currently are
Game: "It's almost over!" Mark: *"Daga kotowaru"*
You only need monty claws now
You could tell the endings were rushed. I hope they fix a lot with dlc.
28:40 has me laughing so much 😂😂
lol i couldn't when he started yelling for Freddy
Wait why didn’t you dissemble Monty yet???
28:44 Freddy Freddddyy you bit¢#
Hey mark I just got security breach
Freddy, You Bastard!!! 🤣
Bruh if you read my comment this play princess 1 in Bonnie bowling 2 the arcade where the DJ is play princess 2 second go select vanny and when you get to the base play princess 3 and win it
it's been a long time since we've gotten a rage game from Markiplier. I enjoy this 🤣😂😭
That ending scene with the staffbots going crazy is hilarious 30:29
I don't know if the latest patch fixed this very useful glitch yet, but after 6am the head of the raceway kart assistant bot appears again where you had to collect it for the Roxy mission and if you pick it up again it will trick the game into thinking it's before 6am again, allowing you to save while doing all this post-6am stuff. Might wanna consider doing that if you actually wanna get all the cool stuff without replaying absurdly long sections over and over again.
the fact that if Gregory just stayed inside Freddy the entire time
I really hope that Mark looks up how to do the secret/true ending of the game!
I cannot believe he laughed when Freddy died 😔
You can tell how disappointed mark is with this game.
28:53                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Freddy: After you good sir
There's like more than 4 endings i think and one of them i'm sure its near the roxy raceway track
he found out yay
No FREDDY!
Hey if you wanna get all the upgrades maybe try going to the save where you get roxys eyes the. Go to get montys claws so you have them both?  Because then you wont have to choose stay and keep looking
Ther is more endings
Top Ten Anime Betrayals: 1. Glamrock Freddy
I can't take this game seriously anymore. I don't even know how I took it seriously to begin with. This is one of the stupidest games I have ever seen
I WAITED FOR THISSS!!^^
Umm INSCRYPTION HELLO???
27:54 and up were the funniest moments. Freddy just running past Mark had tears in my eyes from laughter
So... Who wants to tell Mark that there are 6 endings?
Such amazing commentary on this video!
Hopefully Mark can get all the endings cause there are a lot of them.
mark I doubt you'll see this but when you call Freddy go to where you call him not where you are...
THE WAY HE SCREAMED WHEN FREDDY RAN AWAY FROM HIM
I'm glad to hear someone else was also underwhelmed by the comic style endings.
I was so scared of Monty omg then to watch Freddy go right past LOL
28:41
It’s because mark kept spamming the button. Everytime the button is pressed it sets a waypoint for Freddy to go too. Instead of what mark thinks it is which is when he presses it he thinks that Freddy comes to him. So Freddy kept ignoring him (since there seems to no response for Freddy to stop when he is near the player) and running the multiple waypoints that kept getting placed because of panic spamming.
If there was ever a series to make a highlight reel of someone slowly losing it this is the game
the king of fnaf is reaching the end of this awesome game now... cant wait to see it.
Has anyone told mark about the secret door inside the theater? Maybe that can help him get some of the lore in his head
I don't know if they patched it yet, but picking up the head again in Roxy Raceway may re-enable save spots again.
Why is the Decommission Vannie cutscene a comic. Why is that a comic after having the ENTIRE GAME be *3D* the whole way. I will repeat what Markiplier said and ask Did they run out of budget or some shit? Chica's crushing scene was more intense and memorable. Which is a shame because the ending or at least that decommission one was supposed to be EMOTIONAL but because of the sheer whiplash I was only feeling like cringing tbh. I'm very disappointed. It made Freddy's death LAUGHABLE! And that UPSETS me.  Having the endings be comics is a very bad design choice imo. It does NOT flow well to have that suddenly after everything else was fully rendered and shit really well. It takes the feel out of everything to not SEE it happen as it's happening. I was horrified when they ripped Freddy apart, but now I can't help but find his death weak. I want to laugh at it. Which shouldn't be how I should feel to a character who by that point in the story was like a DAD TO THE PC  Like I GET the game was rushed, but it looked really good for a rushed game as well. If it wasn't for those comics, the rushed aspect would be harder to notice for me. But now it unfortunately is very blatant by how the endings are done
There's a true ending Mark. Look up on how to do it. You'll see.
you serious? X10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
The amount of detail in the setting really makes it feel like a real amusement park.
Why is no one talking about 26:29? I don't know why but the fact that the staff bot over there showed up to legit watch the show made me lose it
Yeah…another quality of life improvement that would be nice, is Freddy coming to YOU when you call him, not to the spot where you called him, just in case you are in fact running for your life when you call him. Overall, I agree with Mark, I think there were other plans for this game originally - or at least I kinda hope there were, otherwise there was a lot of effort wasted on environments and setups that never got used at all. In a lot of ways, this is kind of the OPPOSITE of what made the original Five Nights at Freddy's so special, that game was so bare-bones and stripped down, everything in it was used and nothing was wasted; here, there's such a grand sense of scale and budget, but so little of the gorgeous, detailed environments is ever actually used. The former, honestly, makes for a better game. Being honest, this game was always going to be a letdown compared to the two-and-a-half-year hype, but even so, I don't think it was as good as it could or should have been.
It dissapointed me that fnaf security bridge is not in its full game, and it still not complete and broken. Some end doesnt make sense and as you know, they use comic scene so the game doesnt feel satisfy to me
This game is such a mess. I really hope they fix it up.
There are 6 (I think) endings u found one of the bad ones I hope you get a good one if u continue
at 18:06  US -crying over freddy  mark- having no clue on what is going on   LMAO
mark sounds so done with his past self when he explains his mistakes
theirs a ending with springtrap
1:36 it has a lot of endings.
When you said that Red herring thing it was so interesting and I wonder if they did that on purpose
*Mark can’t get into a charging station and is upset*  Wow mark it’s almost like they said it was offline like 100 times lmdao
Please do the "Best Ending"
Markiplier trying to call Friday is like trying to find your car in a Walmart parking lot
Mark desperately trying to get Freddy and him just going the other way made me laugh so much I needed that laugh
this franchise is beyond gone  they had a chance to give a fresh new take but instead they did nothing and made a shitty, buggy, broken, confusing, anti climactic, just a dead end  this game had so much potential, maybe joining forces with all the animatronics instead of decommissioning them all, but no, just another nonsensical addition to the series   rip fnaf should have ended at fnaf 2
Mark, You also keep forgetting it calls Freddy to your *Stationary* position. He doesn't move with your position, he goes to your stationary position
You’re actually supposed to see Vanny a lot more I believe but something with the map bots made it so it glitched out and stopped working
Mark: *Runs away From Monty While Screaming FREDDY!! And Spamming The Call Freddy Button* Monty: CMERE BOI Freddy: *Goes To The Wrong Rooms And Areas*
In case you didn’t know the game entirely depends at what you choose at  certain parts like you choose to go to chica instead of going to el chips or choosing roxane instead of the alligator on your first party pass.
the entire budget for that ending went into the very confusing cutscene leading up to the ending
Markiplier: “there’s something more to the pizzeria”  Me: THE LORE GUYS, THE LORE, THE LORE GUYS THE LORE!!!
Gregory, I'm trying to find you in the Pizzaplex, but the clapping of my asscheeks is too loud and it keeps alerting vanny :pensive: :weary:
The ending where Monty was chasing mark and he was screaming freddyy’s name was hilarious 😂 he
The thing about the game is it’s a little none liner. Ya can chose to go to different places. Monty golf or Fazzer blast, 3rd floor fire escape or back loading dock.
mark-just look up how to find all the endings. theyre difficult to figure out and theres legit at least 6 endings.
im sorry but i cackled so hard at this
this game looks like its completely unfinished and sucks dick, after seeing everything. How did they release it like this?
There are so many secrets you must find and do. Go check out Dawko for help.
moral of the story, kids are asholes
28:43 Freddy said f you
seeing freddy die hurt childhood me in a way my parents could never and i’m currently 16 years of age and now bawling my eyes out for a bear that does not exist
What happened X1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Mark: 'I DON'T UNDERSTAND!' Also Mark: Ignore most of collectibles and lore.
Freddy runs to the spot you call him, so circling round the stairs without calling him would have had him sitting there waiting. Obviously this wouldn't have worked as Monty caught up but knowing the mechanics is half the battle.
Yes YEES !!
Anyone else know what's up with the Russian "I hate markiplier" bot that seems to be going around?
Try for the good ending Mark
28:45 is my favourite part of the video
Mark got on trending several times with the FNAF security breach series and it is well deserved
I literally died laughing when Freddy just ran past Gregory whilst Mark screamed  in terror 💀💀
Can't Mark use his map, ONCE?!?
i truly love it when Mark rages.
28:40 this got me laughing
This man’s been getting #1 trending in gaming consecutively lately
Mark's ability to neglect and disregard crucial information is amusing and has given us an endless amount of sweet, sweet *CONTENT*
Mark You fool You buffoon Small brain *Smooth* brain If you had stopped pressing the call button for Freddy while you were running around he would've stayed in one place You're the one that messed it up
The ending just makes me sad for the franchise
Maybe if theyd had comics hidden throughout that hinted to vannys lore the comic ending wouldn't have been so jarring stylistically.. could've been cool
28:44 freddy:”im coming gregory!”           Gregory:”Im in here stupid”
I really like some of this content but when anything goes wrong you scream and it actually made me jump when you did that but other than the unnecessary screams I really liked it
Can't wait to see mark try the springtrap ending
Can’t wait til you find the ending you are hoping for! It’s amaaaazing!
Mark there is a secret ending that you can do which requires you to collect EVERY golden plushie from the mystery gifts.
anyone else think that 3d vanny model was hot
At the juncture you are at you would HAVE TO start a NEW GAME and almost literally speedrun through the story so you have use of the charge stations and save stations after at least gaining Roxy's eyes. i do like how there is a six o'clock timer put into the game and it has you aim to leave out the front doors. HOWEVER, once you gained the 4th level security pass (which you can make use of one of the previous save points you've established) and checkout the ending through the docks (or the other one). Ignoring the "story".
28:35 🤣🤣🤣
Monty: plays bass Me: plays bass Me: ooo...yeah, I like this one already
the game: remember! recharge stations are OFFLINE and CANNOT help hide you!  mark: why can’t i go in the recharge station? are you serious?   i love mark and this game is very unclear and frustrating but it’s funny to see him miss instructions
Several things I notice you seem to forget a lot, Mark... Moon can float through the air, so he can probably come at you from above. Also, Freddy said the recharging stations would be offline as you approach 6am. AND, when you call Freddy, he goes to the spot WHERE you called him, so calling him repeatedly does nothing but confuse his AI and make him bug out.
im so disappionted lmaooooo
lmao what a shitty game
Mark u remeber chicas beak? It can stun monty!!!! Get in freddy then left click
Bruh that scream when you saw freddy run pass you was so funny, it almost sounded like your balls drop your voice went super saiyan high.😂
Hold up, Kellen Goff did Freddy.   Like, THE Kellen Goff that was part of Hunicast's shenanigans and essentially was turned into a goddamn bat by Ashley?!
Freddy: You... are my superstar   Mark: Broken Car Engine noises
Mark I think you should find out all the endings in security breach and there are many different types of endings that you should see.
Mark has started entering a golden age of markiplier. Like a few years ago just before COVID.
I literally almost peed my pants in laughter, too funny XD Mark's high pitch screaming was too good XD
The way my jaw DROPPED when they ripped into freddy like that😭
"Get me in you" -Markiplier 2021
i love when mark screams "FREDDYY!?!?"😂
30:00  marki they watched ur video u messed it up for yourself😭😭😭
You know Mark. I think when you pressed the button to get Freddy to come. I think it takes him to the location you once were and not actually make him come to you. Because if he were coming to you then he would be following you while you are moving.
Poor Markiplier he really need a Freddy because of Monty
I love how the article reads “blah blah this article has nothing to do with anything relevant to this game blah blah” thanks Scott. Game theory appreciates it XD
anybody else yelling at mark every time he tries to go into a charging station when it LITERALLY TOLD HIM THEY'RE NOT WORKING
Congrats for #1 on trending for Gaming!
I like it when he is doing well and having fun which doesn't seem to happen much in this series
Listen, Mark. I don't usually advocate for cheating in games but the no-save thing is INCREDIBLY painful, especially if you want to go into Monty Golf and beyond. If you see this, do yourself a favor and head back to Roxy Raceway, where you got the driver assist head. It'll be there for you to pick up again. Doing so will set the clock back to 5:15, allowing you to save, BUT the flags for 6am will still be active, allowing you to play to your heart's content without the fear of staring at the front door again.
27:56 - 29:24 is the best part of the video 😆
I hope Mark finds all the endings
13:53 my heart bye  edit: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO FREDDY I LOVE YOU NOOOOOO  EDIT: ILL ALWAYS BE HIS SUPERSTARRRRR
i definetly agree with your idea on how the game was constructed, it definetly has a heavy "its still like good but not the gameplay parts just the inbetweens and story" It feels like there was a massive change near the endish of development which makes me so sad cause I was way too excited for this ;-;. I definetly have a bias however of wanting to heavily move away from current horror formats in the extremely hand held free roam type things which this VERY heavily follows.
Mark im sorry Im a really big fan but I didn't wait A HOLE WEEK FOR THE BAD ENDING😢
Honestly this game feels like a very meh horror game with a fnaf skin on it
I'm gonna be honest with you, this game fucking sucks.
It's been seven years and I have yet to see mark punch Freddy straight in the gabba- he even swore on his mum...
Marks brain works in misterious ways
Mark screaming at freddy is just-
Mark screaming for Freddy, with Monty right behind him, only for Freddy to bolt right past Mark and go where he THINKS Mark is, which is what Freddy has been doing this entire playthrough, was the most satisfying brick joke resolution and the hardest I've laughed this entire playthrough. You literally can't write this kind of humor. That was nothing short of magnificent.
I hope Mark gets all 6 endings. 5 to go
you can actually save, there's a glitch where if you get the head of the driver assistant again it will glitch your saves, so you can save after the "game has ended"
I love the content can you tey to get the afton ending
Theres a canon ending, youll need to defeat monty, but if you cant do this in one go there is a cheat unless they patch it. Going back to roxys raceway and picking up drivers head from where it originally came from will reactivate saves. HOWEVER i am unclear if you can get back to original choice once you do this as non canon good+ ending can only be acessed by completing all 3 princess quest video games and lasf ones in vannys office.  That said i really reccomend getting cannon ending
28:40 got me in tears
MORE!!!!!!!
Superstar Freddy is best dad figure for Georgie
the comments about mark yelling at freddy r HALARIOUS!!!
I have no idea whats going on
mark's impression of freddy was spot on lmfao
I remmeber it have a ending that you need to play the pricess game in one room that it stop all the robot
i love how they expect us to know that there have been children getting killed at pizzaplex even though it's not said anywhere in the game, and it's never even said vanny is responsible
There are multiple endings you can get, the best one imo is where you play the game in vanny's office
7:31 ah camon my mark gliched again
Freddy: nothing can hide from me now Mark: FREDDY WHERE ARE YOUUUUUH?!?!?!?!?!
Me: crying at the end because freddy dies Mark: laughing because how the ending was animated
There is also a sister location secret room besides the 5 endings
I kinda agree with Mark, that it seems like this game isn't quiet connected  Now, I know the Global Panorama happened and slowed the production down, and that they kinda rushed to get this game out, however!! I think if they added some small DLC side stories that utilize the space and the characters in a more cohesive way, I think this would be the greatest fnaf game ever
If you go Monty Golf they eventually tell you to go to the theatre.
that fakin intro was the definition of satisfying for some reason LMAO
Just wait till he fails the final boss battle for the real ending.
Question, what if you gave freddy Montgomery's claws? Would that mean he would slash the robots
There are 5 endings. .-.
Ooh Interesting theory I’ve come up with. So we know tut Gregory isn’t in the database so here’s not a guest which is possibly why the other animatronics are after him. But when you die, the screen is all staticky. Maybe Gregory is supposed to be some sort of sentient prototype animatronic? I’m not sure, just a thought
This is amazing
That scream to Freddy I’m dead 😂 😂
Me: Yelling at Mark to get to a station so he doesn't have to go through everything all over again
i hope mark figures out that Freddy will not report to YOU, but to the exact spot you requested him to come. so if he's moving around too much, freddy will hit up those previous spots before reaching him.
Game: From now on, charging stations will no longer work! Mark: Well see that's a matter of perspective
Im useally really early bit I was doing stuff I’m so sorry. Your videos bring me so much joy and I’m so happy you chose yo make for people like me thank yours much for standing strong and staying as amazing as you are! :)
👎
So mark here’s a heads up there are six endings for this game. The main stage was bugged for you
Tips from someone who watched a couple of dawko's streams:  As you have said, the game has multiple endings and you get them through some convoluted gobbledygook. One ending requires that you have all the golden plushies which gives you VIP status, letting you leave out the fire escape. (Apparently those plushies are located near the golden pizzaplex statues?) Another requires that you have all of the upgrades for Freddy and so you can investigate what's going on beneath Roxy Raceway. (The thing the digging crews almost found in the lore bits) Finally, there's an ending tied to the playable arcade games hidden in the pizzaplex. (The princessquest ones specifically, which you have to play in order).  P.S. There are a couple others tied to escaping the pizzaplex. One through simply going out the front entrance at the end of the night, and the other involving a car from the loading dock? I'm not too sure about how to get the latter one, hence why I forgot.
Is he serious?
Freddy: **Died**  Me: **Sad**  Mark: **Wheezing intensively**
i don’t think they ran out of budget for the Vanny ending, i think vanny was the security gaurd and she put the outfit on and got her body ripped apart and died from the bots
Freddy trolled Mark so hard hahaha
can’t wait for the finale hopefully he’ll finish next episode shouldn’t be too long now
It's a shame that this is what this franchise has become, from a lovely indie horror game to having a proper company tarnish its name
Freddy tried his best at the end xD
FREEEEEDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYY
Mental breakdown who else cried a little
no no, you're not even closed to finished my friend, for waiting undreground.............he lurks as he is still alive....
Markiplier Was Right There WERE Links In The Description That I Hadn't Clicked On But I Want Him To Find Me!
Mark : FREDDY COME HERE , FREDDY NOT THERE FREDDY Freddy : *dong dong dong*
I litterally almost cried when Freddy said you are My superstar and i saw someone on tiktok who was all like "Freddy is legit my comfort character now" and now I feel terrible
That's it. I had enough of markiplier not reading the instruction, being blocked and wondering why he's blocked.
1.3 million views in 5 hours. Very good YouTuber, I actually remember watching him a lot.
** I will find you **
Mark. Freddy runs to the spot where you first summoned him then he hits every spot after that where you summoned him. You need to stay in one place if you want Freddy to actually come
this intro. wasnt expecting comedy in fnaf.
Are you going to get the rest of the endings?
"You are my superstar" Me: Oh no! Our freddy! Its broken!
I replayed the last 2 minutes 5 times.
Freddy: *dies* Mark: *becomes a car*
Can you make the ending
ive been trying to get to plan a for 36 hours consecutively...... my sanity......
When you call Freddy he goes to the place where you called him, if you call him and run off he might run past you to the place where you called him
God these bots are still here
If only he did Montys first he would know what the theater is for
So you know how Vanessa says to go to the main stage? And there was nothing there? I think if you go after you choose to stay I think it might work? Idk just a theory
its been a week of mark spamming these vids and us spamming his dms to make them
There is alternative Ending but there is specific Place require  THE ROOFTOP ENDING  THE GOOD ENDING DISSEMBLE VANNY ENDING TRUE ENDING BEST ENDING BAD ENDING I will not spoil Markiplier I only tell the ALTERNATIVE ENDING
This is why you don't spam click summon Freddy, he goes to ALL the places you tried to summon him
There are two Vanny endings possible, the second one requires you play all Three Princess Quest Arcade Games in Order, the first is where DJ music man is and the last is in Vannys room where you disassemble her. I don't know where the second on is. They are a orange color.
love these videos
Come find me. I dare you.
No, you're definitely right about the game, Mark. I think the game isn't bad by any means, but it definitely feels very rushed in both gameplay (with all the obvious glitches and bugs) and in the storyline.  They go out of their way to make us sympathetic/like the other animatronics beyond Freddy, but the only way to deal with them is to dismantle them. Why could we somehow just trap and fix whatever Vanny did to them? Then instead of just upgrading Freddy, the entire crew could be helping Gregory. That would have been cool. And I don't think they really established what went wrong with Bonnie and why he had to be taken out. Why is Freddy seemingly immune to whatever Vanny did with the other animatronics? There's some questions I'm alright being left to being a mystery like who promoted Vanessa? That kind of question is up to theorist which is where these games get so much hype. But serious questions that help explain the environment itself like the ones I posed earlier kind of breaks you out of the immersion.  Then there's the endings. Without spoiling any for Mark here, many of them are exactly like the one Mark saw where they go to this weird comic slideshow. This smacks of 'ran out of time, just summarize it'. This game needed at least another month or two of cooking with the developers.  In short: By no means is it a bad game, but it clearly suffered due to being rushed.
I love Markimoo, but him repeating one phrase more than 40 times really makes me want to rip my skin off
THE WHAT HAPPENED PART LMAO
I think when you call freddy he goes first where you press the botton and he go there first  no matter what xd
28:40 FREDDY JUST IGNORED HIM LMAO
28:33 Top ten anime betrayals.
Damn funny how Freddy gets new eyes that can see through walls but now he can’t find you. Poor dude has sensory overload.
How is it possible that the FNAF with the largest budget is by far the worst of the saga?
Game: "Get to the Recharge Station" Mark: *Attempts to get in Recharge Station* Recharge Station: "Nah mate I'm on break"
A "HERRING" is a fish.
If you pick vinny Freddy automatically gets disassembled weather or not he has all the upgrades
for the true ending with spring trap you need to play the whole game without saving and hiding
Man. markiplier makes this shitty game way more entertaining
marks wheezing was literally my reaction when i found out that was one of the endings 😭
You can't save beyond this point- oh, did i mention you were being chased by THE FASTEST MOTHERFUCKER IN THE GAME.   oh, also he got hops, son.
All these years later, Mark still scream's like a little girl 😝😝😝😝😝
vannessa be trollin'
this frikin game is more bugged than Cyberpunk 2077 kkkkkk trash  also: why in the last part you kept running from Monty instead only hide? you kept running and screaming... Freddy was almost out of energy, probably you would die neither way...
Did Vanny get it worse than William Afton did when he donned the Spring Bonnie suit?
that was one hell of an intro
This game is a buggy disaster but it seems pretty fun
28:37 TOP TEN WORST ANIME BETRAILS OF ALL TIME
Mark shrieking "Freddy" in ever increasing falsetto had me in tears.
Damn that bad ending was brutal and disturbing.
Mark: *yelling for Freddy to come Freddy: *walking slowly behind Monty, "Sorry superstar, I have to wait behind this one first"
Princess Quest Princess Quest Princess Quest
Sheeeeeeesh
The fact Freddy is squaring up with the security bots🤣🤣
omg im dying of laughter. "FREEEDDDAAAYYYYY"
Is it just me thats disappointed by security breach? It just seems... forced... or unfinished.. I don't know.. It feels like it just was unnecessary. Im not trying to bash, I just want to know if anyone feels the same or if I'm missing the hype?
Freddy running past Mark was the funniest thing I've seen this entire Let's Play.
I think that SteelWool made a mistake and tried making a game way bigger than than they could possible be able to finish. They probably started well but then had to rush it due to having to release this game this year.
18:08 I agree with this Also why does Freddy not just teleport next to you that'd be so much easier than him finding paths to you
THEN COME FIND ME MARK, ID LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY😡😡
27:53 to 29:20 had me laughing so hard that my stomach still hurts. OMG that was so FREAKING HILARIOUS!! "FREDDYYYYY, FREDDY YOU B***H!!"😂😂😂
18:23 yes mark the true ending isn't that
22:42 “MOVE!!! THATS MY SON!!!”
So is that just the end of the series?
Freddy has ALWAYS ran to the spot you were standing when he was summoned. He doesn't follow you, he follows the location of the ping, so even if you leave the spot where you pinged him, HE will go to the ping location.
Maaarrrkkkkkk, moorreeeee looongerrrrr vids
YOU PRESS Q
You should do a video on the game scrutinised
Seeing Freddy run right past mark had me dying 🤣
You can go back to roxy raceway and grab the broken head and it will let you save if you choose to stay
10:13: Ain't no way Vanessa set this man up. XD 14:27: 😂 14:50: Death. Death is what it means. XD
that was probably the most dissapointing game ending ever DX
28:42 The despair
why do you keep cruching on freddy?!? just hide !
This series is already such a comfort to me. My holidays are already starting to go roughly and having these episodes to look forward to really makes my days a lot better than they could've been. Thanks, Mark.
I like this game, but disabling the ability to save at the end of the game has to be one of the stupidest ideas I have ever seen. Completely took the choice from the player. Hardcore punishes the player for wanting to know more; especially when the dialogue between Freddy and Gregory invite the player to look for more answers.
3:40 had my little sister  cackle, Marks screams never disappoint Lol 😂
Imagine if they might add multiplayer within the game. If you think on how big the game and all the rooms, but they would have to make the badges easier to get but randomize where they spawn that whoever plays as Greggory obtain. But they could in theory add some mode to where someone plays as Greggory and the Gang. But hey that’s just a Theory a “Game Theory”
If you listen to the trailer that shows the band going up on stage and has afton talking to Gregory you can actually tell a difference. In that trailer it seems as though Vanessa an Vanny were like sun and moon. Based off that trailer it feels like a lot was changed story wise.
I'm so confused what happened at the ending
Freddy moves to where you summoned him not where you currently are that's why he goes to the other end of the room sometimes
28:45 this fucking killed me
Mark! If you're planning on "staying" and exploring and trying to get Monty's claws eventually, it's gonna be a bit of a challenge to get through all of that without having to save.  There is a small cheat though! I got this from watching 8bitRyan's playthrough: After you decide to "stay", go back to Roxy's Raceway where you found the service bot head. It will allow you to pick it back up and somehow reset the time to 5:15am and make the save stations functional again. At least, I hope it still works!  Loving your videos, and good luck!
Mark: "I'm gonna do the trick where if I jump into a charging station, I might just automatically hop in with him (Freddy)" Disabled charging stations: are you serious
So many things are broken in that game lol
Mark: you enjoy my suffering..   Me: you right....
The fact that we are either simping for Freddy or he’s out comfort character. Lol   Not to mention people are simping after the Sun and Moon too (that’s me. I’m people)
I have very mixed feelings about this game
Honestly, it’s kinda funny since there’s a minor glitch you can take advantage of. If you go back to Roxy Raceway to retrieve the robot head, the game will think it’s 5:15 and let you save
Is there gonna be more ? Lol
I think I read somewhere there are four endings to this game… Hopefully Mark plays more because I really enjoy watching him play.  Also Freddy running right past you was both hilarious and extremely frustrating.
"youre my superstar" is now going to hurt as much as "sayonara"
You know, most of mark's suffering could be avoided if he actually read the instructions or remembered them
Mark, if you stopped running around like a headless chicken, you would have found a lot more lore and understood the story branches more. You missed A LOT of stuff. Such as the "dead" FNAF characters in the garbage.
I kinda feel bad for Vanny since the we saw Freddy get disassembled by the bots ripping him limb from limb (during the animation not comic) meaning Vanny had her limbs ripped off which is why I think they make it a comic so it wouldn't be as gruesome. Also I agree with Mark that Vanny is a red herring
at last you have to select leave button for happy ending at freaddy give option
28:43 had me laughing
Okay vanny…. Hear me out…..
OH MY GOD FREDDY GETTING DISSEMBLED MADE ME CRY SO MUCH
I called it, I knew the kid was a secret agent
A couple of these endings I’ve seen them all btw made me cry including the happy ones
Mark. You're missing so much. So many endings. I want to see you play again. There's a lot of lore you're still missing. Some of which would absolutely blow your mind. Please, keep going.
"How did I miss all this stuff?"   *walks past bright pink highlighted collectable*
Is the boom when the wet floor signs look at him, an in game thing or does he edit that in cause I laugh every time
Mark, you were *this* close to the best ending: there was an arcade cabinet in the vanny office.  Beat it, it's worth it
I hate your suffering
freddy saying “you’re my superstar” to gregory made me so emotional 😞
27:48 The most insane and desperate moment starts here: FREEEDDYYYR!
FREDDY!!!!!!
The frantic screaming for freddy as if his actual life depends on it. 100% worth it.
You never noticed that when you see glitter around the sides you need to go charge up
What a joke
Mark after freddy dose not immediately teleports you BASTARD FreDdY
the url literally has bruh in it
I’m very disappointed about the end ….
Who else waiting to see if there’s some sort of 20/20/20/20 mode?
Vanessa: “Gregory, I think you deserve a reward. Go check the main stage… 😏”
Ngl I got a little teary eyed when Freddy says u r my superstar to Gregory on the animation idk why that line just concluded their friendship
*Moon spawns literally before Mark's eyes* Mark: WHAT Moon: It's past your bedtime! Mark: HOW? Moon: Knock knock!  *Moon kills Gregory through Freddy's chest* Mark: *_NOOOOOOOOOO_*
Good news Its almost a 🐓
Mark he goes to where you ping him not you when you ping him... you have to stay put and hide lol but I get running frantically in a frightened scurry
hey mark, in response to the thing at the end about Freddy being called, i have a feeling he now has to respond to the first location you pinged him and will then travel to the next pinged location until he gets to the last pinged location, so when you spam the summon in one location and leave, he wont follow until he reaches all pinged (prior) locations   this may not be acurate, just what i have gathered from what i have seen here and on other youtube channels. See you in the next one! :))
Mark there are 7 endings, have fun…… Edit: none of them say which one is the real one but you’ll know which one is the real one when you get it
shitty ytber
I hope mark keeps playing later on. I would love to see his reactions to the other endings
28:44   Markiplier: "finally sees Freddy" get me in get me in  Freddy: "completely ignores him and goes upstairs running"  Markiplier: "high pitched voice" FREDY, FREDY YOU B*TCH! FREDYYY FREDYYYYYY
this whole series is like watching a senile old man lost at a shopping mall its really sad to watch but you cant look away because your curious as to what he would do next
No one else: Mark: "Where's the exit? I think it was this way..." Me: "YOU HAVE A FUCKING MAP FOR A REASON!"
Mark if you see this, here is something that will help you, when or if you go to the roxy's raceway, get the staff bot head that you already did. After that the save point will available (Cuz the game thinks you'll still doing the Roxy decommission stuff, maybe) hope that works and when/if works, then will help you get done easier.
I just saw this I was so excited to watch it I love your gameplay
That ending felt like it let me down. It was anticlimactic in the way that it had gone to like story boarding. I didn't care for it.
Wtf was that ending LOL
Freddy:fucking dies Mark:funniest shit I’ve seen
Find me 😶
whyd nothing happen at the main stage?
There are more secrets then what he got to lol
Markiplier, there are like 8 endings
“FREDDY YOU BITCH”
No longer the king of fnaf …. He has fallen, lost his touch, how sad 😞
i’m sorry but watching freddy being disassembled made me shook
Mark’s really still putting out content the day before Christmas Eve. An honorable creator right here! Thank ya so much, Mark and team!
0:07 heh
Just stay in the place by running round and round and freddy come  than smaping Q and freddy go to spot where you smap frickin Q
Freddy: *dies* Mark: *WHEEZE*
Gregory: Theres a bear in my watch who calls me superstar  Security Bots: Please leave our pizzeria
if you listen to this video like i did while cooking it sounds like mark is having a stroke half the video whenever he just goes "what what what what what what what what what" lmao
6:35 the pink triangle is a secret room you will need chicas voice box and Monty’s claws to get there
You are my superstar ;_;
NOT ME CRYING OVER A ROBOT BEAR
Vanny kinda bad tho, maybe I'd choose her too. Also the Vanny end is kinda fucked up, they probably didn't animate it since the security parts ripped apart an actual human, since it's just Vanessa's fursoma
"Good news! It is almost a cock!" killed me way more than it should have omg
HELP I CRIED WHEN HE SAID "YOURE MY SUPERSTAR" FREDDY NDBDB
There are 6 endings
28:42 is when I died of laughter
Freddy will go to the area you summon him from. If you are moving he will not follow to the new area you are in. so I recommend running around in the area you summon him and not run to a completely different area.  Also the outro is a banger and the full song is great.
chaos rockstar freddy
Soooo where’s inscription
9:25 that reward sounds like something freddy wouldnt like
Mark: Freddy! my savior has came to save me.😇 Freddy: I must get to the top floor, even though Mark is on the staircase being chased to death.😈 Mark: FREDDY YOU SCUMBAG TRAITOR!!!!!🤬
You can stay to collect everything and do another ending, but you can't save?! Bullshit.....
It looks like you can save.......
I feel like the should have a mechanic where Freddy can shove other animatronics out of his way
My favorite part is that Mark was so set on trying to get inside Freddy that he forgot he can hide and wait for Freddy to arrive.
What is Mark’s problem with the wet floor signs?! I think they’re cute, and I’m with Dawko on calling them Pat-Pats because you just want to Pat-Pat their head. xD
Cue The Clash.  Freddy:  "If you go there will be trouble, and if you stay there will be double.  Should you stay or should you go?"  Gregory: "Vanny..."
I love Freddys interactions so much
This game it's just bad
i wheezed way too hard when he started screaming "FREDDDYYYYYYYYY" while he was being chased by monty💀
Actually Mark, there are different routes to take to get to different endings. Also, to get to the best ending but not the canon ending, you have to play all three Princess Quest games and then the Vanny ending. But the Canon ending is after you completely upgrade Freddy, explore Roxy Raceway. Good luck, Mark!
there are so many aspects of this game that are so poorly done.. like I get that this is a fnaf game but they just assumed that we would know that there where disappearances at the pizzaplex? and it all feels so rushed from the cut scenes to the "information that we should already know with nothing telling us this" it feels not like a fnaf game which in some ways it's good! but in others it just doesnt fit
Ik the Vanny ending probably isn’t the real ending bad WOW that was kinda garbage
honestly this game was a huge letdown. especially how hard they worked on the environment for so many areas to not be utilized or explored at all in the story or gameplay is so disappointing, if they didn’t rush so much to release the game and maybe even took like a year, this game would definitely be much longer than it is.   the voice acting and graphics are outstanding though, i wish this game was made to its full potential, just makes me sad since the fnaf series was my childhood
This was so enjoyable to watch. The screaming of Freddy made it so beautiful hahaha
I always come back
Mark you're causing your own suffering at this point. xD
Freddy: “I got you” sees monty* Freddy: “I’ve never met this child in my life”
Jumpscares:   3:33 Moon (sound) 7:29 Moon (sound) 10:45 Moon 12:24 Moon 27:53 Security bot 28:27 Security bot 29:14 Monty
Mark is very stupid, but Freddy's path finding is wack
Mark you can actually upgrade freddy’s battery!!
the captions my god XD
man this game feels so unfinished. pretty disappointed by this game, the story is incredibly odd too
Mark there is a Ben aftian ending as well mark it have someone from fnaf 3 but Ik u can find it
Mark you are so funny bro “FREDDAY YOU LITTLE BITCH”😭🤣🤣🤣
I've had sneaking suspicions as I've been watching the game, but this episode kinda confirms that this game really did not have enough beta testers.
@markiplier my 5yo daughter was watching you today and I asked what she was doing. she said I'm watching "Markiplayer". I asked do you mean "Markiplier"? she said no it should be "Markiplayer" because he plays games....
FREEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I wish they had just delayed the game and got more of this stuff fleshed out, the location is so cool, and the concept is also great but with all the bugs and plot holes the game feels unfinished
FREDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!! YOU B*TCH!!!  Absolutely hilarious lmao
"FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!!!"
Do the alternate ending where you go to the very bottom and it's the old fnaf
I bet if you used the mainstage and went doent youd meet Vanessa below
Jumpscares 10:45 12:23 27:53 28:27 29:14
If you're impartial to using bugs, currently you can do an exploit that's very simple and allows you to save after staying. If you go back to the roxy raceway or wherever you got that STAFF bot head from, you can actually go pick that up again. Simply having that head in your inventory allows you to save. (I don't know why this allows it, however it doesn't interfere with any quests etc... simply allows you to save.)
Hope mark continues inscription after this playthrough, both games are soooo interesting i love that hes kinda playing them back to back.
28:35 cried laughing
@Markiplier FNAF tattoo? Have you thought of getting one?
Everybody gangsta 'till mark starts screaming at a animatronic to save his ass.
the way freddy works is that he comes to EVERY point that you request him not the most recent. so if you summon him at spot 1 he will go to spot 1 before spot 2. so when you spam call freddy it makes him come slower. Also hence why he will run past you toward the direction you just came from.
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation?" The fact that Mark said that while laughing after watching Freddy die makes this scene so underrated
The last 3 minutes of this video was total chaos. Mark screaming FREDDY!!!! and freddy running past him and totally ignoring his commands while monty chasing him like a maniac. That was so hilarious.
Mark, youd be more intimidating if i could actually see your eyes when youre *attempting* to death glare me.
Top 10 anime betrayals at number one…
Mark: *sinister breathing* I will.. come find you. Game studio: *uploads patch*
10:45  Officers I swear! I saw Moon Man use the sharingan!!!!
Being chased by Monty: Panic Freddy starts running to you: Calm He doesn’t stop: **PANIC**
Just me who hates moon? I love sun but moon just creeps me out so much, dude :/
I hope he goes for the other endings. Or atleast the true ending
7 Years Ago: "FREDDY DON'T YOU DARE COME NEAR ME"  7 Years Later: "FREDDY HURRY UP AND COME HERE!!"
“ Good news! It is almost a *cock* ”
Mark: FREDDY DON'T WAIT YOUR TURN  Monty: No he my friend Freddy: bruh child do you even know manner?
Do more ending like the true ending and the princesses quest ending
Try to get jumpscared by Vanessa it’s actually the worst jump scare of all time lol
Great episode dude! Happy Holidays! 👍🎄🎅
FREDDY!!!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Please
Play more f***ing inscription
Hey mark, Freddy goes to the exact spot you called him from one after the other, so spamming the button to call him just screws you over. I hope this helps you out later on so you don't have to suffer as much.
FREDDAYYYY!!
you promise you will come find me!! that is my dream mark!!
Dogs be like 1:05
R.I.P Mike Hoffman 😢
1 out 6 known secrets wooo
Me: crying because Freddy got disassembled Also me: "Aren't they going to show us them tearing into Vanny?" Also, why do I feel like Gregory would unmask her as if they were in Scooby Doo? 😂
28:00-29:25  LIxian need to animated this part it was so funny
The way the game jumpcuts to certain cutscenes is so jarring. Like going from putting on the head of the Driver Bot to suddenly driving the cart. It's just a sudden transition, the same with choosing to investigate Vanny. It's just...bam suddnely you're there and things are happening. They really should have taken a bit longer with the game to make these things transition more smoothly. Also, the way that "if I leave the disappearances will keep happening" thing went down felt like poorly-done exposition. It was dropped like we should have already known there were disappearances and that maybe Gregory was there because of them? But then we really get nothing else from that exchange other than Freddy agreeing that something fishy is up.  That point in the game should have gone a bit more in-depth with the disappearances and Gregory's reason for being there without apparently having paid or come with his parents (or anyone else). Answer some questions but not all of them. The entire game has been one huge question of "wtf is going on here", and generally waiting until the very end of a game/book/movie to reveal everything leads to the resolution feeling rushed and not nearly as fleshed out or well-paced as it should be.   Mark screaming in soprano "FREDDY YOU BITCH" was amazing, though.
The first 11 minutes in is Mark hurting my brain as he missed the text saying "recharge stations are not available", I love the guy... but he has some dumb moments
Nooo please don't start making 30 minute videos, I need more
Mark finish it please.
Im pretty sure that the cannon ending is the princess quest one, play and beat all 3 of them to unlock the ending, thats all im gonna spoil for you
There is a glitch where hopping into freddy a certain way will deload all walls for a short time and allow you to basically skip most of the game.
30:07 😳 darkiplier?!?!?
mark:  "click the links or i will find you, i will find you."  me: well looks like im not clicking the links    JK JK JK (its a joke) ...or is it.....jk it is.                             maybe.
Mark:FREDDY!!!!*slowly gets higher in pitch*
The extra areas are related to other choices you could have made. For example, the theater was part of either Monty Golf or the Prize Counter quests.
Mark you need to find two Princess quest arcades and play them. Then you choose Vanny and go to her hideout and play the last Princess quest arcade in her room to get another ending. You can load to the 5 am save slot to do it.
I heard the reason that scene with vanny isnt animated because vanny is actually vanessa so the security guards are literally ripping a person apart which would be a lil too gruesome
I’m gonna be honest I absolutely hate how much hate this game is getting :/
I would risk it all for Vanny
Freddy and I apparently have the same walk tempo so walking around the house listening to this was a TRIP. Every time I took a step it was CLUNK CLUNK CLUNK-
Love how Mark just instantly thinks they ran outta budget in the endings when its supposed to be a dramatic moment lol
I don't know if you will see this Mark, but there are 6 endings to the game, 2 of which where you can save Freddy
17:52 I CRIED AT THIS SCENE-
Their was that extra secret in roxy raceway with the hidden elevator
28:52 - Screaming like a school girl is tight. xD
This is not like the others fnafs, the others wanted you to survive to 6am but  now you need to win before 6:00
Not gunna lie, that ending was really disappointing.
petition to make disney recreate a 1:1 of this in one of their parks
can we talk about mark’s freddy impression being actually pretty good
this play through is both hilarious and infuriating.  curse you Markimoo and your comedic stupidity!
Can I clarify something real quick with Mark's statement about the unused area? He is entirely wrong. There is only really two small area in the entire game that isn't relevant and this is from someone who got every ending in Security breach. At the beginning, you are given the choice to explore the underground for the dock or the thirdfloor for a fire escape. Then later you are given the choice to play Fazer Blast which sets you on the path to dismantle Chica, which leads you through Fazer Tag, to the bowling Alley, then into the bowels, or you can choose to play Monty golf which sets you on a path through the golf place, then through Mazercise, then the underground theatre he explored talking about the unused areas. When going for the true ending you will explore the entire map of the pizzaria with only two locations you won't go through. Those being a small cupcake kitchen you get an achievement just for finding and an area next to Roxy's raceway that has an extremely important arcade game called Princess Quest that you need for a secret ending.
Your supposed to play all the princess games to unlock true ending
Everyone else’s relationship with Freddy is so wholesome and joyful. Meanwhile Mark and Freddy, not so much-
Love this game, is mark gonna finish inscription?
Bro....Mark......I TOLD YOU TO PICK STAY AND THIS IS WHY!!!! 19:24
You can leave at the 3 exits
oh no everything in this game was good until the ending
Sweetie you have to press button and wait. If you press it multiple times he resets. Also where you press it is pinpointed so if you press it and then move he will only come to the spot were you pressed it.
i can’t help but feel that the game was very lackluster
dont spam that freddy button if u spam that freddy come to first pinged location
While Mark was screaming "Freddy!" I was screaming "hide, idiot!"
did mark just unlock a secret ending nobody knew about from being stupid then failed to actually trigger the ending
This has been a very nice series so thank you mark and merry Christmas!
Theres gotta be more to the trash area. where all the trash tunnels are. i feel like that was hella significant like who tf made those. the employees mad trash tunnels? and the area that looks like a kids hiding sppot
Mark: "FREDDY DONT WAIT YOUR TURN!!" Me: *Becomes light headed from weezing*
Old freddies who got souls as their power: *look of superiority*
Freddy reminds me of Captain Holt from Brooklyn 99
This Pizzaplex is so darn big. That's a shame they made about a 5 hours gameplay. I wish they would delay the release or instead of trying to manufacture so much places, utilitize the ones they made. Adding different playing components, maybe defending yourself from a wave of security bots etc. Also that comic-style ending would be one of the saddest scenes I've seen yet it only made me confused and laugh just like Mark.
The problem you're running into is that he runs to where you summoned him, not to where you are, summoning him while running will make him run past you, nothing changed or broke, you're just not meant to do it while chased.
I don't think Freddy is broken. I think what happened was that  A) You are correct. Unlike before, he doesn't teleport as much. Now running from point A to B instead of teleporting every time the button is pressed  B) Freddy goes to the last pinged location with maybe a cooldown before he switches to another spot. Which makes sense as most of the time Freddy run pasts Mark, is when Mark is moving quickly through the area. (Not always the case)  Honestly the best course of action is to simply hide when being chased. Focusing on trying to get into Freddy is a mistake given the fact he doesn't always go where you want him to go.
This game is like a fever dream
I know it must have been annoying to have Freddy run past him but oh my god that part was so hilarious
Freddy had the claws in th me final animation before mark went back and decided to stay
I really want to see him react to the ending Vanny with the machine
Jumpscare timestamp time, hopefully not the last one! ------------------ 10:45 Moondrop 12:23 Moondrop 27:53 Security bot 28:26 Security bot 29:24 Monty ------------------- [yes mark, they ran out of budget making that scene]
Play the ending again and find the one with Springtrap
Fuck Freddy, Talking Rolling Shutter Door is my comfort character
I like this game, but at the same time it feels kind of weird the way it has played. Like now you have to do what you've been doing but entirely without saving? So you can get your collectables which is cool, explore everything, but one bump into Monty and you lose everything.
Love how Freddy wasn't going to Mark and it was entirely Mark's fault for spamming the button
My eyes are forced shut from laughing too hard at Freddy running past Mark as he desperately cries for help. Then I hear "FREDDY, DON'T WAIT YOUR TURN!"
The way Mark just speedruns that first ending
I just love the image of Gregory rapidly mashing his FazWatch, sprinting in and out of party rooms, and yelling for Freddy as Monty chases him down screaming "HEY KIDDO"
if you go to the bowling area with freddy he says something sad
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS YESS
Wtf was that ending?  That was so bad and nonsensical.  Holy crap.  So bad.
Markimoo! Do the "leave" option first, just to see the neutral ending! :D
I hope Freddy whoops Vanny’s ass.
"Freddy yo bastared! "
28:39 He must be right there !!!  " Proceeds to run past him "
i dont think he realizes that freddy has always ran to where the call signal came from meaning he will even run past you 😂
my guess of why the game is the way it is because it went over budget or something like that, which is why the have those weird ass comic book style cutscenes towards the end.
✝️ Fellowship invite
I must say, the way freddy dies as the 2nd two star ending had me have a tear in my eye.
How big is Fazbear entertainment electricity bill is also music man is the definition of why do I hear boss music
PHEWPH, I was worried their wasn’t gonna be a vid today, but then I searched it up and their was. DAMN YOUTUBE NOTIFICATIONS MORE THAN FOUR HOURS LATE!
28:42 The betrayal
Anyone else feel AWFUL for the other animatronics? This game made me love them ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I like the game, but the pacing is kinda terrible. Especially whenever they use a cutscene.
Game: the recharging stations are down Mark: are you serious? Are you serious? You serious? You're serious right now?
The game had been delayed a bunch Mark, so there are some areas that aren't finished/aren't as polished as others. Its entirely down to time constraints.
Play the arcade machines 👍👍
Mark the way to fix the problems you’re having in this game is to wear the flannel.
I can’t breathe and I think I peed a little. Freddy is such a deadbeat dad! “FREDDY!!!!” “Yeah, sure- just wait up, Superstar- I gotta go grab some smokes first.”
not the outro being the bots beating the crap out of Freddy LMAO
Hey mark do you remember the bunny from fnaf help wanted? I think that bunny was an easter egg or something hinting that vanny would be in this new version of fnaf
What a bug
Someone pls make an animation of this!!  🤣🤣🤣
I guess Mark just hasn't noticed that where he presses the call Freddy button is where he goes.
28:48 can someone make an animation of this I'm crying
“FREDDYYYYYYYY”✨✨✨✨
Now Vanny knows what it is like to be destroyed like she did Freddy, ultimate revenge.
“Good news, it is almost a cock”
monty is better at finding Greg than Freddy is, even though greg sends freddy updates on his location every 2 seconds
This game feels unfinished
I think the developers broke more than just Freddy. I think they broke Mark as well.
i really dont understand the reason for disabling saves. what a shitty thing to do to someone who wants to see it all and collect everything.
They did not run out of buget at the end its a comic
Bots will reply to this comment.
the screaming of freddy was very annoying... you know he literally comes right to where you requested first before he can go else where. That seems to have been the case since the launch of the game, as shown in your videos. It was just super over dramatic. Things like that are what made me stop watching pewdiepie and unsub
Markiplier is Amazing! My content is garbage! THERE, YOU FREAKING BOTS, YOUR SPELL IS BROKEN! GAH, every freaking comment. These bots are atrocious.
Security Breach is just another game that prioritized graphics and open-worldness over gameplay and story.
Mark summoning Freddy is like me trying to get my cats to get in the house.  I LOVE FREDDY SO MUCH!!!!  I’m gonna miss this, I love how we got to have a friend in this game.
The look.... of utter exhaustion..... that Amy must see on his face after recordings like this...... I wonder if she has a bag of takis powder and a blanket just waiting for Mark next to Chica so he can decompress. Either that or a padded soundproof room so Mark can scream and rage without hurting himself lol
I like to think of Gregory as one of those "unreliable narrator" types of protagonists, especially with the comic book styled endings, as well as that theory going around that Gregory is a lot more sinister. The rest is a spoiler:            There's CD tapes you can pick up with the eyes upgrade that have recordings of two people's therapy sessions with multiple therapists, one being with Vanessa and the other with the mysterious patient 46 - the theory is that 46 is Gregory, since the therapists tend to talk to 46 like a child rather than if they were an adult compared to Vanessa, repeatedly mentioning working with schools and children, and mentioned 46 fantasized frequently and was confronted about being a pathological liar during their last tape, as well as several of those therapists going missing and one was mangled by a machine. You can only listen to those tapes on youtube, since you can't access the last tapes through gameplay normally
theres actually multiple endings-
what if you.. hear me out, restarted the entire game and chose monty golf and what if monty golf made you able to torture monty and what if that gives you a different vanny ending bc what if montys parts (sounds weird dont take that out of the context of mechanical robots) give you the tools to make freddy be able to fight vanny? idk food for though idk maybe u can stay, idk this might be a terrible idea and you might go crazy playing the entire game again
Possible minor spoilers! Read at your own risk.     Security breach has 6 endings. Mark officially got the worst ending aside from just leaving. 5 of the endings are comics except the true final boss. The first 5 are fairly easy, 1 is a bit convoluted but not bad. The true ending is hell. If he wants it, he is going to need to dismantle Monty. By going through Montygolf, the underground of the theater he explored in this episode, Mazercise (hellish puzzle), and the defeat Monty in one of the harder boss fights then find a secret. All with no save points! Good luck Mark!
this game is made so poorly like????
Find me, you won't.
as you can see mark sat quietly as his best friend was disassembled 😔
Someone's gonna ship Gregory and Glamrock Freddy, I'm telling you, someone's gonna do it./The theater has an Easter Egg
Merry Christmas Mark
Man this game is disappointing
30:16 i haven't visited either link. Im counting on him to come find me
Why would they kill Freddy 😡
I really wanna like this game, but there's just so much wrong with it.
"freddy you bastard!" had me dead 😭💀 ngl mark really got me feeling his fear
That last part got me so good, my heart was racing and everything!! I was squirminnnnn
Go and reclaim your throne Mark as the KING OF Five Nights At Freddy’s
I LOVE YOU
I love the FNAF universe and almost all games till this point has been consistently good. However, this game just objectively sucks (like I want a refund sucks).
I love this version of Freddy so caring good hearted despite him being an animatronic.
The first Markiplier video that i have seen that made me laugh out loud. WELL DONE
Come find me
Freddy’s like, “bitch imma leave you for your own problems” 😆
Gregory don't have parents, he is rather an orphan or kidnapped. The lights and pizza in the sewer was where he stayed
5:10 I laughed so hard when Freddy went through Roxy’s door.
this game is so scuffed...
This isn’t the end of the game
Hearing Mark scream FREDDY!!! was the highlight of my day today. Almost made me choke on my frappe.
I had my hand on my forehead while laying down so when the moon guy got mark on the stage I JUMPED AND POKED MYSELF IN THE EYE😂
I feel like the "6 hour" format really hemmed them in on this one. I personally feel the game would've benefited by them having it go into the next night by having Gregory knocked out or something at 6am the first night that way they would have had double the time.
Freddy wait for ...... Was the best everrr
Mark: Freddy? Freddy!!!!!! Where are you?!!!!  *distant clunking*  Matk: Do you not know where I am?????   *clunking continues but is still just as distant no matter how many times mark tries to call him*
🥲 so nobody gonna tell him that he ran pass the Main Entrance EXIT Various times? You know.. The one you've passed multiple times Mark?
This game is terrible.
28:48 Freddy was like nah
This game is a mess-
Everything about the vanny ending felt so sudden and out of place lmaoo
No-one's talking about how amazing the wet floor sign gag is and it's upsetting
Such a unique and intense game. I really enjoyed that lol
FREDDY !!!
when Freddy left him: he said nah bitch you on you own 🤣🤣🤣
Sad part is that you dont see Vanny that often to really care.
Can u do some more inscription
Anyone get Nuka World vibes? Starport
Im laughing so hard my stomach hurts when freddy runs past him and he like screaming for life 🤣🤣
Freddy you bastard!!!! - markiplier 2021
YES!!! YES!!!! Finally SOMEONE is willing to criticize this game
I love the part when freddy is about to fight the bots I would love to see that  But the disassemble freddy is a cutescene it was gonna happen anyway
Awwwww man I wish you would have pressed the button on the stage that first time.
How did mark know about the real ending
Freddy: *dies* Gregory: *crying* Mark: *Laughs*
Remember folks, report and move on
they really fucked up the ending smh
Mark, there's six other endings besides the one you got. You get one by playing all the Princess Quest games (in order) and then going for Vanny (the final one is in her office), you get one by simply leaving the Pizzaplex through the front door, you get one by obtaining a security level of seven and exiting through the loading dock, you get one by collecting all the golden plushies and exiting through the toy shop by El Chip's, and you get one by obtaining all three upgrades and going down the hidden elevator behind Roxy's Raceway. (Yeah, I know that was only five. I forgot the last one. :P)
Lixian is going freestyle on Freddy i see. I’m glad he YouTube pooped us and made Freddy say “It’s almost a cock.”
Does anyone know what Mission: Plan A is though? If you kite Moon Drop could it be an undiscovered ending?
It would be fine if, once saves disabled, the subsequent gameplay was a choice between a few ten-minute skill-based survival segments like the original games. But it's not.  It's several hours of wandering through a massive mostly-empty map.
Imagine being marks neighbor and just hearing F R E D D Y Y O U B I T C H
Has anyone else been hearing odd sounds occasionally throughout these videos? Kinda like the radio static Mangle made in 2? One happens at 23:19 - 20 point. I only point this out because Mark never seems to react to them, which makes me thing they are a editing input signifying something at the edge of the screen I am not seeing? Edit: I now realize, from it happening again like 20 seconds later, that sound is an editing input for the wet floor signs.
I love how marks first ending was the worst one possible
How many eps till this is finished? :)
man mark is really bad at this game
I was really hoping this would be the last so I could watch breakdown videos already lmfao
FREDDDDYYYYYY YOUUU JUDDAAAAS
Me: literally crying  Mark: 🫖🫖🫖🫖
28:39 Freddy: Fuck you Gregory!
I feel this game is 50% Freddy not listening to Mark and the other 50% Mark not listening to Freddy.
Look HOW MANY PEOPLE worked on this botched game!  Mindboggling. It is an offense and disgrace to game development.  Mark does not deserve this. We do not deserve this for watching every other playthrough he did.  All the people who are fans and play all the games themselves as well, do not deserve this.  Look how angry Mark got at the end. He hasn't lost his mind this much for a long time. That's a strong indication of how bad this game is.
Mark I been hearing that the og five nights at Freddy are in the game and apparently u can find a secret ending that shows spring trap is in it
THEY KILLED MY BOY
Mark there are in total of 6 endings!!!  The first, bad ending, which has a one-star rating, requires you to simply exit the Pizzaplex through the front door at 6 AM. Gregory escapes alone, and it doesn’t end well for anybody.  The second, good ending, which has two stars, demands you to stay in the building and obtain a Level 7 Security pass. You can then go into the Loading Dock area through the ground floor kitchen and escape that way. Freddie and Gregory escape with in a van. It is a sweet ending, but doesn’t “solve” anything.  For Ending #3, Unmasked, you’ll need to upgrade Freddy with Roxy’s eyes. Then, when the clock strikes 6 AM, escape the Pizzaplex using the emergency exit at the Prize Counter area. You’ll escape to the roof, the place will start burning, and Freddy will save you from Vanny thanks to his new eyes.  The fourth and probably best of the FNAF Security Breach endings is also the true, canon ending. To get it, you’ll have to defeat Chica, Roxy and Monty and fully upgrade Freddy. Then, you use the Old Elevator to go down into the Old Pizzeria and a boss fight ensues. I won’t spoil what happens during and after said fight.  To get the fifth ending (aka Disassembled), you need to play Fazer Blast and discover Vanny’s lair above the arena. Then, as you approach the front door at 6 AM, select the “Vanny” option instead. Press the button in her lair and just follow what the game tells you. This is the only ending that Mark has gotten!!   The sixth and final ending is also the only three-start one. It requires you to complete two Princess Quest arcade games (one in Roxy’s Salon, one in the Arcade, where Music Man is). Then, when you get to an exit, choose the Vanny option, but instead of messing with the button, you can play and complete the third arcade in the villain’s lair. This triggers this ending, which is the trickiest to get.
Thanks for the news Freddy, I did not know it was almost a cock
I get so sad everytime I see the ending where freddy gets tossed and dismantled
I didn't expect the betrayal of Freddy on the last part
I will not click the link never
25:00 Mark theorizing development (keeping this just in case that it’s true)
If I’m remembering correctly, at some point the game got datamined, and when Scott found out about all the things people put out, he scrapped the game and restarted.
Find us like Freddy did
God, I forgot how INCREDIBLY LOUD Mark is. I'm getting a headache. EDIT: OH MY GOD, STOP SCREEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAMIIIIIIIIIIIIIING
Pls continue inscryption
mark you cant keep pressing the call button on freddy bc YOURE the one bugging him out lol
I.....couldn't bring myself to watch the ending without pausing the video multiple times bc of cringe. Like, what are those.. comic strip endings😭😭😭
pls... go back into the actual daycare section!
Not sure, but if Freddy is near a save terminal, you can still save your progress. Doesn't hurt to try amirite? :3
This isn't the end, there's like 6 different endings
Think he'll ever find and play princess quest?  Which is an actual ending.
11:37 “are you /srs?”
mark: i will come find you me: please do i wanna be famous on youtube
When Mark went to the main stage, did he ever try pressing the button on the center of the stage? If he did, it wasn't included in the video.
Mark, Afton is still in the building!
Is this the last episode?
Imagine your marks roommate and you just hear: “FREDDY!!!!!! FREDDY FREDDYY i:!!!!!!!!!!!”
i like all he did was see a ending and die. thats all he did this episode
So he's done with the game, like he's not gonna play it anymore?
28:42 LMAOO
If you want to get a Special ending, you have to play and clear the Princess Quest Arcades in order 1, 2, and 3 is accessible after selecting the "Vanny" option.
Mark : "Freeeeedyyyyyyy!!!!!" Freddy : *walk past mark Mark : "Omg freddy you bastard"
Freddy cares about the safety of his friends, which is why he refused to shove past Monty on the stairs. It may have caused Monty to fall after all...
So nobody is gonna comment on the circus baby plush?-  22:34
Only 30mins
Mark is getting triggered
6 different ending
Freddy just wanted to get his daily stair run miles 😂
"Plan A" just updates the quest to tell you it's 6 and the doors are open. It'll pop up when you choose to stay. Also, there is that door with T posing Freddy behind it that has a sign saying "Main Stage" next to it... idk why they didn't think we'd mistake the stage we first see the robots on performing as THE main stage, but uh, yeah. I do hope Mark doesn't bother with Monty only b/c no innocent soul should be subjected to the hell that is MAZERCISE. This buggy game held me in a weird Stockholm syndrome.
I love FNAF, but this game feels unbelievably sloppily made. I dont know if it's due to Scott's exit from the project or what, but they've clearly cut MASSIVE corners and just not bothered to even attempt to make their game function properly. Endless game breaking bugs, animatronics teleporting around, Freddy just not coming to you at all or teleporting to some adjacent room then running around the whole complex at hyper speed. It's funny and all, but quite frankly the state of the game is embarrassing for a FNAF release.
28:42 Freddy peacing out on yo' dumb ass, c'ya
Come on I just wanted to watch this all
Hey Mark, if youre reading this, There is a constant replier in the comments, and he is just spamming "Mark's content is garbage, watch mine". And also theres this other guy saying stuff about your niece... im sorry you have to look at it, but you should ban them
Really
I actually think this was just the main game BUT in the future, we'll see the next nights with other character/s and they'll use these rooms with almost none purpose. Also, one of the endings states that children has been missing but there was no visible evidence that connects with this place (it's obvious that this place is a trap but in every game there were clues of what happened to each disappeared kid and i don't think this is the exception regardless if it happened in the books or the place itself). I'm still waiting to see the 20/20/20 mode in this game
An over abundance of simple things that coincide Is complex which usually has simple solutions
why did i actually get emotional
No one:  Absolutely no one: Freddy as Mark screams his name as Monty chases him:     👁👄👁
Freddy: *dying, saying his last words* Mark: *W H E E Z E*
Freddy is such a troll in this vid 😭💀
and thus begins the "finding all the secrets" portion of a FNAF game.  have fun Mark.
should have chosen the vanny ending but instead of going straight to the button to kill her, use the princess quest arcade in Vanny's room that the earlier messages mentioned.
When you call Freddy he goes to the last place you called him, not directly to you xD or at least thats what i gathered from all of this
Best part of the entire video was mark screaming his head off running away from Monty while Freddy just let him get caught 🤣🤣😂
Lol
the url for this video has bruh in it.
i feel mark most of the time is kinda distracted from the game itself, all those areas are explained when they made yo choose betwen two locations with the ticket thingy, i mean its not bad but its something i been noticing a lot
Everyone reaction to the ending: **Sad and some Tears**  Mark's reaction: **wheeze** wha-wha-what? Did they ran out of budget for the ending? **Wheeze**
What happened to the voice upgrade?
the part where freddy ran past him up the stairs while screaming for freddy was by far the funniest thing ive seen cant stop laughing
Aren't they're, like, 6 endings?
Entering and exiting freddy reminds me of titanfall
Did anyone else cry with that first ending 😭😭
28:42
mark, I sure if you can get 3 stars, but I thinking it's very hard to hunt for it
is it weird that i actually cried when freddy died in the vanny option bc i am now attatched to freddy and when he said "you're my superstar" i balled LMAO
My birthday is the 24th let’s celebrate
THE FIRST ENDING MARK DID IM CRYING REAL TEARS FREDDDYYYYYYYY NOOOOOOOOOOOO-
Mr Markiplier go to the charging station and remove the glow from the Moon Man effect it's literally inside of the upgrade station you can get rid of it there so you don't get killed by Moon Man like half the time
the url for this video has bruh in it.
gort
Welcome back to another video of Markiplier yelling at Freddy Fazbear who once was a jerkface and now is thy savior meaning Glamrock Freddy is officially Jesus while Freddy aka Jesus runs past Markiplier aka Gregory and Gregory screetches at Freddy for an entire 45 seconds if I counted correctly
Confusion
28:12 Mark: "Freddy, I need you right now" 28:40 Freddy: **goes right past him** I think Mark will never hate a pathfinding algorithm more than this one
Maybe you should take a break😅.
First
I laughed so hard when Freddy ran past mark and Monty.  it was hilarious.
Wait until mark realizes that freddy goes to where you called him from
I feel like he forgot that he could have just run to a charging station to escape Monty that way
Freddy is like the father we never had.
you should go back much earlier so you can find all the collectibles, play the arcade games and get all the secrets. its more open world than u think- dig for the answers!
mark if you don’t play the princess quest minigame i swear monty’s gonna eat your feet.
Him screaming is too damn funny an him yelling at freddy was just hilarious my mom is dieing of laughter in the background as I'm watching markiplier 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He said he will come find me if I don't click the links in the description. So that means I can get a chance to meet you without having to go to a con?
Mark please keep playing there is multi endings in the game there is a true ending
Love how the game gave Freddy an emotional send-off but when you choose to stay like Mark did, Freddy bails out on protecting you
Vanny is a red herring. Haha! I wish that were true mark! This game was a disappointment and a waste of effort!
did anyone else cry at the ending?
0:05-0:06-0:07 Freddy Good News It's Almost A Clock(Chicken Pic)
You can’t get a true ending unless At 6AM, choose to “STAY” — then unlock the final upgrade. You have to do this without dying, as you can no longer use Save Stations after 6AM. Travel to the door in the back-left corner of Roxy’s Raceway. This leads to a path that requires all three upgrades to complete. You’ll find an elevator leading down. Take the elevator — this is a point-of-no-return, so make sure you have a separate save file. This is also where you’ll get an extra autosave. You can n o t die
I hate how the endings feel so anticlimactic and have no meaning towards them. The story that was implanted in the game doesn't set up Vanny in any way and having her being in multiple endings feel so out of place. They showed her being really important in the trailers and being major part of the this games story. I hope they implant the original story they showed in the trailers back into the game as a DLC or something cause it would make the game 100% better.
This game was a steamy pile of shit ending it with a un animated low budget comic? This is seriously some mgs5 bs
Well I was right  Edit: no I wasn’t
MARK PLEASE, I understand if you wanted to wait to show everyone. But I think you’ve completely forgotten your Chica Voice box upgrade. Last I recall L CTRL will stun nearby Animatronics. You may not be able to stun Monty with your FazzBlaster, but that voice should. Please I wish to see/hear the ability
"Freddy you bastard"
Do yourself a favor and stop pressing the freddy button so much. I gathered that freddy queres every request and goes to designated locations. So if you move and use it he will not be at your location, he will be at the location you pressed the button at.
part 8!!!
28:35 me running away from my problems
I LAUGHED MY ASS OFF WITH "FREDDY, YOU BITCH" AT 28:40 OH MY GOD.
It's crazy how correct Markiplier is about this game's development
Markiplier: Click on those links in the description or i will find you :)  Me: Yeah right, sure you willlll  *Goes to bed and hears my door swing open*  Markiplier: I TOLD YOU I WILL FIND YOU! MUHAHAHAHAH!
i’m litteraly crying rn over freddy dying and saying “you are my superstar” 😭😭😭
This was like a really bad game 😂
God the pacing w the story n gameplay in this is so extremely… wonky 😭 Like cutscenes r dropped in randomly n things that feel like they should be important plot points are glossed over. Stuff is so confusing and makes the emotional and story beats not hit as well.
Freddy was too polite
28:40  Freddy: **summoned by Gregory and comes towards the stairs** Freddy: **sees Monty rushing down the stairs in a rage** Freddy: "Oh, that's Monty. He's my friend! You first, pal!" Monty: **reaches Gregory and tears him to shreds** Freddy: "Wait..."
The animation budget fucking flopping in the ending was really a breath-taking experience
I think Freddy is having trouble with pickung you up cuz you spam Q. Maybe he would be doing better if you simple press it one time. Though its hillarious how your running and screamming around before you die lol.
The first ending was more rushed than Lamar Jackson
three ways i have seen people do are  1) to upgrade Freddy with Roxy’s eyes. Then, at  6 AM you can  escape the Pizzaplex using the emergency exit at the Prize Counter area 2) you will need to complete the two Princess Quest arcade games in Roxy’s Salon Arcade and Music Man is). Then at an exit, choose the Vanny option this should let you can play and complete the third arcade in the villain’s lair.  3) leave with Feddie Loading Dock area through the ground floor kitchen and escape that way.  i think they have six endings this is just the ones i have seen.
The “thank you everybody for watching, I’m done” at the end was priceless 😂
I'm refusing to look at other endings 'til i see them all from Mark's videos. I am patiently waiting so please do explore to your heart's content Mark!
Everyone boost this so mark might see it. Mark you have some bot problems that are spamming peoples comments. Can you block them so they don’t comment on the rest of your videos? Also everyone else block them!
Someday Mark will realize he CAN shoot the security robots, but he has to hit them in their FACE. It's his own fault he's a bad shot.
You deserve a reward, go check the main stage" That's not the tone you use when talking to child.. Nope no sir it is not.
Mark enjoyed so much that he decided it wan't the end
I love the part where mark said, "are you serious?"
It's crazy how Gregory ran after seeing what the bots did to Vanessa. After he hit the disassembly button, they ripped a human in a costume apart. I would have ran right after that too 😳🏃‍♂️🤖
There’s 4 endings
I think Freddy runs to the location where you first pressed the call button, and then doesn’t respond to you calling him after he reaches the location where you first pressed it.
Mark screaming Freddy in a shrill and panicked voice got me
*doesn’t click the link because I want him to  come find me*
Mark shouting Freddyyy!! Was so genuinely good and got me laughing
Five nights at Freddy or Five nights at terrifying 💀
30 MINUTES? TF
25:42 (to the right) fred, what ya.. what u doing there bud
Look behind Roxanne's salon and the first princess quest machine is there. In the back corner of the arcade where music man came out is the second. And in vanny's secret hideout the third one. If you play all three in order than you get a secret ending
in my opinion they should have cut the world in half and done two parts. it’s too much in one game so some parts feels unfinished. i think keep daycare, arcade/dance floor, gazer blast and main stage area
What's funny is the majority of his pain would've virtually disappeared if he could just stop running directly into the embracing arms of the Staff bots..
I think vanny was gonna be at the main stage
Freddy dont wait you're turn😂😂😂 got me cracking up
Hey @markiplier wait to defeat Monty it's crazy
I love how he doesn’t read a single hint but still gets as far as he does
From what ive gathered, freddy heads to the last place he was called, and doesnt answer any other summons until he reaches his destination
The way Freddy just runs past him every time
Vanessa tho 😩
freddy ditching mark sent me lmao
i cant with the screaming XD
Freddy was a little confused, but he's got the spirit, though
This game really goes from an insanely epic, animated intro sequence to a bunch of drawings as one of the endings-
Freddy...
Letting U know there are 6 endings so you can continue playing to get different endings 👍 (I wont spoil the endings)
30:06 Yoo darkiplier chillll
Freddie arrives on the exact spot you are standing on even after you left he will still arrive on that exact spot, You want Freddy to come to you then don't move.
You are nowhere near done. There are a bunch of endings and you still have to go back and do the monty golf option.
This was such a dissapointing game 😭
There are actually multiple endings to the game,the one u got at first was actually the had "bad ending", u are on the right track for the actual ending but remember there are different exits to the place....hint
That ending was hilarious XD
There are more endings. You should get them.
is anyone going to tell mark about the power upgrade
Mark do all the ending for more content
I love watching marks confusion compared to everyone else I’ve watched
Freddy running up the stairs like he had to complete his life's mission and ignoring mark completely is HILARIOUS
I dont think mark realised how freddy summoning worked he goes to were you called him not directly to you he didnt change
Omg freddy said nah I out bye
Repeating what your saying over and over and over , is honestly annoying
Am i the only one who thought Venessa was sounding flirty when she said *go check the main stage*
freddy ignored you just like you ignored him talking about his new eyes </3
28:40 comedy gold
28:42 Hold on there superstar, Freddy has to take a supershit
Mark just screaming “FREEDDDYYYYY!”
Mark there is a secret ending that has something to do with springtrap
markiplier can  you say happy birthday to me it would  make my day?
I was eating during this and I swear to god the moon man stage jumpscare and the one after it nearly made me throw up jesus christ, both were very unexpected  edit- wow I was having a fun time with this and watching mark play, but this episode itself really sold me on the fact that I am never going to waste my money on this game, the story and such was fun but over time it just became worse and worse. The endings seem disappointing and it's all just meh.
I actually got kinda sad seeing Freddy die. I really got attached to that bear ;-;
Yeah idk this game seems insanely unpolished and overall forgets that someone has to play this and understand whats happening
I don't think I've ever heard Mark scream as shrilly as he does in this video. I've also never had that much fun hearing Mark panic lmao
“FREEEEEEEEEDDDDAAAAAAAAYYYYYY!!!”😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😵
Pretty sure the game could have, been more if the Wokeness mob didn’t cancel Scott
if you see this you can get a canon ending: How to do it since you have montys claws go to Roxy race way. In the raceway on your left when entering is a door leading down. You can open the gates when you have all of Freddys upgrades. Once you do that take the elevator.
Mark i just hope you don't forget Inscryption after you're done with FNAF
I was hoping this game/story would be a lot longer :(
Episode 7: Still doesn't know how Freddy's summoning button works
My god this building is bigger than all of Disney. You have three stories and two sub level basements, a race track, bowling alley, arcades, dinning halls, a dance room with a fricken Kaiju animatronic, a massive underground trash pit type place, a security office, a daycare center, a main stage, front entrance area, gift shops, and probably a bunch of other things I forgot about.
Mark i was watching ur sad vid about ur niece and im really sorry about it ik is a long time alr but just want to say that she is lucky to be in ur family if i were her i will die with no regrets i may be from singapore and i cannot do much but i will always support u and btw i got security breach sad ending tho lol
Freddie works fine. You're the idiot who keeps Spamming the call button. Once you find a way to lose Monty, Find a nice open space to call Freddie By pushing the button once Not 5 million times
Yeeeah you have to go through the whole game again playing the princess games in order to unlock the true ending :(
Freddy: “You’re my superstar.” Me: “aww, thats so sweet-“ Mark: *literally turns into a car engine*
Am I the only one who cried when Freddy died😭?
Top ten saddest anime betrayels
Find the sinkhole
What would have been really cool if one of the last plushies was of Markiplier with a crown, as a homage to the one and only "king of FNAF"
So by not clicking the links, I get to see markiplier in person?
11:42 IM DEAD BRO XD
FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!!😂😂😂
Mark forgetting the game said he can't use recharge station and them him going "are you serious? Are you serious?" .... :/
On a next stream can you do  this for every achievements?? Or something like that
Freddy: Hold on, I just need to squeeze past Monty... Monty, stop hogging up the line. Mark: FREDDY, YOU BASTARD!
This would be marks hell if it was real
Watching Mark yell at Freddy at the top of his lungs was the funniest thing ever
Mark : FREDDY!! Freddy : **sees Monty** aight, imma head out
Freddy goes to the place you click so spamming click makes him go to many places, that’s why he kept running past you
Don't worry guys! Mark was totally speechless and wheezing out of confusion on the vanny ending. Had me in tears how he was trying to shed tears but his breath that smells like chicken sandwiches ruined it all 😂😭
Theres another ending in vanny if you play all 3 of save the princess arcade games
Markiplier you have to do all the endings there are quite a few but the coolest one is upgrading Freddy the rest then using Freddy to break down Gates and going to Roxys raceway, this ending is fucking nuts and such a twist it makes u go oooooooh!!!!
Mark, I love you, but please give this game some slack and try to enjoy the games interesting design choices. Something is being tried and you shouldn't give it so much crap all the time for its art design. But yeah, I do believe some stuff was kinda messed up with development, I just enjoy that it's actually interestingly put together.
The way freddy ran past him in the end
"You ran out of budget for the last animation" Lol
The way he screamed FREDDY and he ran by was pure comedy
Freddy comes to your summon point, so if you summon him then walk away he will go to the point of summon not to where you moved too.
I don't think I've ever tensed up from nervousness and laughed at the same time until I saw Freddy pass Gregory while he's getting chased by Monty and Mark is calling for him 😅
I love how markiplier just stares at the caution bots and says nothing then continues
Leave ending Stay ending Vanny ending
freddy:''dies'' mark:''sad gamer noises''
Freddy: Gets brutalized Mark: Confusion
ahh i was looking all morning for this
I´m sory but i couldnt stop laughing when Freddy went right past Mark
I don't know if it's just Mark's particular play through as it's the only one I've seen of the game but watching his video makes it look like the game explains exactly nothing. The player is just told things as if they make sense.  FNAF has always had elements of mystery for those that cared about the lore but this game decided "mystery" meant "leave out all character motivations and entire sections of story then expect the player to care at the end." I'm glad that Mark points out these failings too. It's really disappointing and frustrating when a game series you love absolutely shits the bed. It feels like the game was released half finished, both in terms of gameplay and story. SPOILERS         That moment when something disappoints you so much you feel the need to write a novel about it. Ha. After hunting down a video of the alternate endings I'm even more disappointed. I don't ever expect everything to be explained in FNAF but I do expect a basic, cohesive narrative. Simply telling us the kid was homeless and snuck in would have helped tremendously in connecting with Gregory at the start of the game, even if that information alone wouldn't have solved all of the story issues. Several of the endings don't make sense, the "best" ending is done in the comic style while the "good ending" is fully animated, why? Why the comic style at all? Why is the kid offing the bots and then sort of lying to Freddy about it cultivating the idea that Freddy might turn evil at some point? Why is Vanessa not more fully explained during the game itself? If you're a FNAF player you're sort of predisposed to see the guard as the good guy who's just doing their job. Threading more of the Vanny angle into the game earlier would have helped in that regard. Why is Freddy a good guy? Both of these questions are answered in various endings though imo the explanations are unsatisfying and more importantly leaving these revelations until the end of the game completely ruins any connection with the game one might have as a returning FNAF player. As Mark said, the story is so disconnected that it's hard to care about. There's far too many "Why is this all happening?" moments.   The OG games were stupid simple. Security guy/Kid/Some Poor Bastard tries to survive the night against homicidal robots. I feel like this game tried to tap into fans of the series love of the deeper mystery surrounding Fazbear Entertainment and forgot to make the basic premises of the game make sense.
Ok i can't be the only one who cried at that comic ending😭 I'm so upset and Mark was LAUGHING🥺😤
wait so you are gonna finish the ending ending right?
I could tell Monty was proud of himself when he finally caught you and dismembered your seeing organs
Mark asks if they ran out of budget for the last animation. DID THEY RUN OUT OF BUDGET FOR AN ENDING?! edit: ... if there aren't playable mini-games I will be pissed. Like MatPat went through Monty's area... and it SUCKED. Beautiful but zero game content.  correction. the boss fight was cool. But there was no golf. Also, we never got to play at the raceway. WHY have arcade areas if it's all aesthetic? Sister location was better. Mark is so right. SOMETHING is missing and or off. Whatever game we got isn't the game that was planned. I know Scott kept pushing back the date because it kept getting bigger... but this game feels so unfinished. It is so well designed and all the rooms and areas look amazing. I WANT to play in each area but seems there is no gameplay there. It's really strange. All the messages about the arcade games suggest they are playable, but they haven't been. I would have assumed FNAF VR coins would have shown up as game tokens so we could play the games. Either there is a big patch coming cause this game is incomplete, there is a big hidden area that will reveal a good secondary story OR I need someone to hack this game and make it playable into what it should have been.We talk about Mark descending into madness.... what about MatPat  O.O
freddy: waits his turn mark: high pitched demonic screaming
Does he find the BB game?
I really love this game but it feels so... janky. Freddy's summoning, all of the run speeds and AI of the animatronics (chica teleporting, for example), the way certain parts play out, loading issues in some of the areas and the overall objective of alot of areas isn't clear and it can be frustrating.
Yes the 'vanny' is the true ending 'stay' is the good ending 'leave' is the bad ending there's also another ending called princess quest ending but am not gonna spoil it but ya but u gotta play the princess quest game or something in the game machines or whatever it's called but basically u can find the 1st and second princess quest minigame in the pizza Plex then u gotta choose vanny and go to her secret lair and the third princess quest minigame. That's
fredayyyyy fredayyyy
Freddy: "These eyes are amazing!"  Me: * literally can't see close to 90% because the game is too dark when Moondrop's vision effect is on *
So I think the way this game works is that Freddy goes to every ping in order no matter how many more times you’ve pinged him since…
I feel like this game is missing a lot, which could be where they try to get people to theorize but it makes it weird
So his humor has devolved to just saying the same word like 30 times in a row, I guess?
Things I learned 1. What happened 2. What happened 3. Wut happend 5. WHaT HappEneD?!
Marks constant yelling is just...the worst, half these vids arent even commentary it's just him saying one thing over and over and forgetting mechanics the game already told him (like moon getting you when you're in Freddy and the charging stations being down)
Freddy ran past mark like he was a schoolgirl late for class
FREDDY!!!!!!!!! 😂🤣
What is FNaF anymore
Mark! you can save after 6 am!  - There is an Assist Bot’s head located in Rocky Raceway - Collect the head and you should be able to save wherever there is a save spot  Good Luck!!
Oh god, Freddy running past Mark on the stairway made me laugh so hard I got dizzy.
Mark: I don’t think they used every inch of the place, like this movie theatre.  …Mark always finds himself in areas he’s going to be in the future b/c he doesn’t follow the storyline 😩
That ending where Glamrock Freddy died tho ;w;
Mark needs to find spring trap
5:53 AM Mark: this can’t be the end… Me: Well there’s 53 minutes left on the video so I’m guessing no-
Holy shit that last part.  I had to watch it again.
Awesome
Freddy's summon is based on where you were when you summoned him so running around frantically calling him is probably the most amazing and effective way to make comedy gold.
Mark seeing Freddy die: **confused wheezing** Freddy seeing Mark die: I thought you were downstairs!
yes
28:42 Had me cackling
Not me CRYING over Freddy's "You are my Super Star" T^T
His wheeze at the dismantled Freddy ending is so damn funny I stg I’m sick right now and the amount of laughing this caused me ended with an aggressive coughing fit lmao
3 other ending minimum to do
The ending for the Vanny choice was kind of anti climactic. Maybe its just their chosen way of presenting that final cut scene, but the scene where Chica was decommissioned was much more intense than this ending.
He walked right past the princess game- Right past it-
Most of this video was one word FREDDY!!!!
Merry Christmas to you all
Mark is just not like normal people, instead of (assuming he would be) finishing the game and coming back to do his stuff with a save, mark went against the system as if people would actually reward you for going against foing the obvious and sensible  Also, Mark's complaining is getting on my nerves
Freddy is just Roach now front he Witcher 3 🤣
As the 'As Seen on TV' voice guy would say, _"But wait! There's more!"_
You should take Freddy into the Bonnie bowl in for a Easter egg
SALT
Mark you need to get the best ending
I hate it when developers go for a different stylistic choice like in this game where some cutscenes are comic strips and other are 3D animated and people just write it off as "did they run out of budget?" or "lazy." It's honestly sad.
"That's not just any Freddy, that's my emotional support Freddy" - Mark, essentially.
THERE IS A ENDING YOU CAN LEAVE WITH FREDDY PLEASE DO IT
We need somebody to  animate mark freaking out over freddy
27:54 GOT ME SO BAD
Mark there is multiple endings
Get all the ending
Hey Marks, so uhhh I don't if you still remember but there's a game called inscryption. It was real good man...
This has got to be the most random start to a fnaf video
Why does he not notice the dolls around the pizzarea from past fnaf characters? I saw a foxy one from fnaf1, a circus baby one and a marienette one
Mark: *watching the scene unfold* Freddy: “you are…my..superstar..” *dies* Me: *shook* Mark: “so..did they run out on budget?”
Mark is so nice about this unfinished game lmao
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE PLAN A MISSION?
Yes we do enjoy your suffering 😂😂😂😂😂 have been since 2013 👍🏻👍🏻
FREDDY YOU BASTARD
Jumpscare List:     03:30 Moon Jumpscare But İt Was Only The Sound? 07:25 Moon Jumpscare But İt Was Only The Sound? 10:42 Moon 12:21 Moon 27:50 Bot 28:23 Bot 29:11 Monty
gah deam vanny....
Mark, at top of his lungs: *FREEEDDDDDDYYYY*  Freddy: i pretend i didnt see that
Super, SUPER buggy game but totally worth it honestly.
There are many endings I count 6 at least so have fun
"you are my superstar" after the fucking comic book ending KILLED ME
Poor Freddy having to run around to all the spam requests only to run to the next request location
30:18 sus face no way?!?!!?
doesn't click the links purposely 😏😏😏
So are you done playing the game or will you come back to get a different ending?
28:44 IM CRYING
“I can’t help you right now Gregory, Gregory is calling for me!!”
Who else felt absolutely bad for Freddy as he was getting torn apart by the service bots?
Looking forward to part 8
Freddy runs to where you pushed the button.. so with spamming the button you might be confusing the game, but also, Freddy is going to run to one of those points. Hence when he ran right past.
There's other endings too idk how to get them 😕
I love he screams Freddy but it was due to mark just spamming his call button lol
i wonder if they made the whole pizzaplex as a building and made a game around it
Five Nights at Freddy’s ❌  Five Hundred hours with Freddy ✅
Plz continue with fnaf and subnautica below zero
11:19 bruh marki seriously forgor what Freddy said in part 6, he said that the power is out or smth so the charging pods are disabled
I really hope Mark eventually realizes calling Freddy nonstop just bugs him out
i hope this isn't the last Episode
this ending is very odd
The game only has 1 actual night? I was about to pay for a 1 night at freddys and not a 5 nights? _Extreme dissapointment_
Game: Do you wish to stay? Mark: Vanny.
"good news! It is almost a cock!" -freddy
If you choose to stay, you need to destroy Monty. Once you destroy Monty, you will get the upgrade then you will get a mission. Follow the directions, you will get the canon ending. You find out what happened to Bonnie and the original animatronics are cameos in the true ending. You will meet a little someone from FNAF: Help Wanted. It is also a theory that Vanny was the protagonist from Help Wanted but I can completely unsure because I haven't played or seen the game.
That was the most boring, anti-climatic ending I've ever seen   They didn't even bother animating it
Is there gonna be another episode¿?¿?¿??
There’s more endings
28:42 Looks like Freddys new eyes are working lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So if Freddy had the Monty claws, couldn't he have like. Clawed through the bots??? Or no? Am I overthinking????
WHY DIDNT HE CHOOSE THE LEAVE OPTION??? 🥲
Roxy lookin kinda fine until she got her eyes popped out
I hope Mark does all the other endings, he is gonna love the main ending
3:52 turn on closed captioning and read it
I think when Mark says about the game feel unfinished or have a different intention I think it is mostly because Scott leaves the game mid-development because of his situation ( the death threat to his family and stuff ), it feels sad though knowing there will be no more fnaf game after Scott say this is will be his last Fnaf.  *Man why we can't just enjoy the game and not do stupid think...*
it seems like if you call freddy while hes already on his way, it makes him stop. so when you hit the call button several times in a row, it could end on him just stopped i think?
At 25:29 the shadow in the corner kinda remind me of the shadow animatronic that would appear in the kitchen camera in one of the first fnaf games
Mark you actually needed to finish which it’s Monty. I’m pretty sure you probably skip a part of getting Monty. And the are many endings so based on those 3 options you get different endings. That being said you only got the vanny ending
Let’s go mark keep up the good content
I couldn't stop laughing. Usually when you say "Not like this, Freddy!" It's Freddy about to attack you, not you calling him to save you! Pfft, this was great.
Here a life saving tip: if you re obtain the damaged head at Roxy Raceway, it reactivates saving
Tell me if I'm wrong, but I think it's a comic because it isn't the true ending.
I hope someone animated the last 3 minutes of this part
Mark doesnt know that theres 7 endings
Freddy was like “Oh hey, superstar I gotta go somewhere.” *runs* “Oh, hey Monty.”
wait woah woa w ht what  im confused
If only the game had a AUTO-SAVE INSTEAD OF A SAVE YOUR SPOT FOR VISITOR IN THE HIGH LEVEL AREAS
Lmao yo Freddie diped on u
**Freddy dies tragically** Mark: *wheezes*
mARKIPLIER do all the prinecess quest arcade there is I , II and , III
In part 6 Freddy said that the recharge stations were offline. Just if you didn’t remember.
*mark goes to the main stage cause of vanny* me: What an idiot
*doesn't click on the link so that Mark will come find me* :3
The fact that freddy goes to the exact place where u ping him is killing me 💀
28:53 I think Freddy's pathfinding needs a few tweaks.
Freddy is busy looking for flowers to pick for his new friend- superstar Georgery to actually help
Dude Mark is really pandering to that 14 and under audience he’s almost unbearable to listen to anymore.
Freddy you bastard!!! D'X< jajajajaja stop running next to me and let me in (deep inhale) LET ME IIIIIIIIN!!!
Freddie ignoring Mark was so entertaining LMAO
Kill monty
"FREDDY!!! FREDDYYYYYYY!!!! FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!"
I guess they ran out of budget for the last animation. That prompt made me die
I get too excited when I see the next episode out , I could watch this for ever
The saving works again after you decide to stay tho
God that ending was hilarious
You needed to read the books and pay attention to the VR game in order to understand about Vanny and Glitchtrap
Wot.
Freddy's voice gives me mufasa vibes but his movements are too goofy lmao
I never knew Mark's voice could go that high while calling for Freddy and running from Monty, best part of the video by far LOL
I really hope Lixian animates that last part with Freddy and Monty
So many endings mark, Vanny is a person so gruesome
Jumpscare times:  3:34 - Moon (jumpscare seems to be bugged.) 7:29 - Moon (jumpscare seems also be bugged.) 10:45 - Moon 12:23 - Moon 27:53 - Security Bot 28:27 - Security Bot 29:14 - Monty
You gonna find us like Monty found you, Mark?
You're not. . . "completely" wrong, but here's what actually happened. The publishers were scummy and rushed the devs and the game because they wanted it to be a holiday title so they can get more sales from christmas buyers. This is why the game launched in such a rough state with bugs, cutt content, and non-working content that is in the game but doesn't come up because of a bug and thus it acts "like" cutt content. . . except that it wasn't meant to be cutt and isn't cutt, it's in the game. . . . but it's just not working. The "Plan A" mission is a great example of such non-working content.  Another example is the "Vanny Meter". The longer you stay in one place, the more the vanny meter fills, if it fills high enough, it summons Vanny. . . if it actually worked. . . which it doesn't because it's currently bugged, so vanny never spawns. . . which is why she's barely in the game despite being the "main" antagonist.   I personally find myself torn because I don't want to support publishers scummy actions of rushing releases like this but at the same time, for the fnaf franchise, this is a huge thing, it's a completely new direction, and I want the publishers to know that I support the direction the franchise is going with "game design" where I want more games in this style. . . but I don't want to think they can get away with rushing games like this. If we don't support it, we might not get another game like this. If we do support it, they might rush out another buggy mess like they did with this one. Screwed if we do, screwed if we don't.
Game: Freddy dies Mark: WHEEZE
11:58 JJJ "You serious?"
Soooooooooooo...... was this the finale?
the end of this episode was mark’s villain origin story
Hahahahahahaha FREDDYYYYYYYY
26:16 -  >that Intermission ad on the screen >Let's All Go To The Lobby To Get Ourselves A Treat  Wasn't expecting THAT reference. Well played, Scott.
I see a broken man
this game is hilariously broken
That ending had me fucking hysterical man
27:51 when disaster happens 28:42 when disaster end (if freddy isn't a bitch)
Freddy: Whenever you need me… I’ll beeee thereee Mark: No you won’ttttttt
Mark: sxreaming Freddy's name so high pitched he's opening a gateway to hell  Freddy:*pepe laugh* Adios
28:37 bruh that shit was funny af😂😂
I really hope mark knows that freddy goes to the exact spot where he is called to and not to your exact location so hiding in freddy is useless when running from the others
Thank you mark, giving us a laugh about how shit that ending is
I love seeing Mark suffer
So I'm gonna make a wild guess that Freddy prioritizes where to go based on location and as a series. So if you run around pressing Q 50 times, Freddy is going to run to where you pressed Q the first time, then the second time, then third, etc etc and essentially scoot around 50 times. Then he'll keep following your Q press bread crumbs.  Instead of prioritizing the latest button press and running there, he prioritizes the first button press. So he was running to wherever Mark was hammering the button like a minute ago.
Get all the Freddy upgrades mark and then go below roxy raceway!
mark if you want to save just go grab the bot's head in the same place in roxy's raceway that will allow you to save again
Me: sleeps at 12  Mark: I can't stay up past my bedtime at 6.
AS I SAW IT I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW FAST A CLICKED-
Never thought I'd see the day Mark cries out to Freddy for help in a Fnaf game
freddy really said “sorry gregory, you’re on your own with this one” 😭
15:25 I never laughed so hard in my life! 28:15 I almost pissed myself😂🤣😂
Mark's scream is so comical and I love it XD
Hope he goes back and finishes Inscryption, it has such a great story and it gets so interesting as it progresses.
I freaking love watching you make these videos mark
We also need another parady with mark saying I will find you, where mark just attacks/finds you for not clicking the links below, that are completely easy, and lead to some pretty neat stuff, so please click on the links in the description Mark would greatly appreciate you.
The worse freddy game I ever seen XD
Mark: “FREDDAYYYHHH I NEED YOU”  Freddy: hehehe I go brrrrrrrrr
At this point the animatronics aren’t even possessed anymore, it’s just cyber terrorism.
Our King's crown seems a little tilted. Good luck on finding the hidden lore. You'll need it.
go away  *sobs*
Btw Roxy Is hiding something about the "Old Fready Fazbear" and the gameplay is simmilar to the joy of creation......fire......
Yo but why did they make vanny hot?
I'm waiting for the true ending video
And after that I thought it was the end but then Mark keeped talking so I stayed
FREEDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!
you still have a boss fight, I wont tell you who
Mark, I think you constantly hitting the "Call Freddy" button is screwing with game's path that freddy can take and each time you hit it while he's coming towards you is forcing Freddy to find a different path because there is obviously more then one path to reach you. It's like hitting Detour on a GPS system and screaming at it that it's not finding the route you normally take as you're driving.
mark there is a secret ending with springtrap in it, i dont know how you get it though
the theatre part is for the decommission monty quest
It's risky, but you can.. sort of bug the game out to allow you to save.. maybe. You just need to go back to Roxanne's speedway and get the assist driver's head again.
If bro Freddy goes where you point It's not a summonham button It's a go where you point but if you want Freddy in front of you look at the ground in front of you and press the button if you want him upstairs look upstairs look up stairs and press the button and he'll be waiting up there for you
Will the bot go under my comment too? I'm going fishing!
There are multiple endings
Someone needs to animate Freddy running past mark, while Monty's after him, it's too funny.
Gl finding me in BFE Texas...
And now another series at its end or extremely close to its end my boredom
Mark: FREDDDYYYYY, FREDDY YOU BASTARD! Freddy: waiting his turn on the starts and running right by mark
Markiplier: FREDDY! Freddy: DON’T WORRY, I WILL SAVE YOU! *runs right past him on the stairs*
Can anyone please explain what plan A is because right before mark got jumpscared by moon a message called “Plan A” showed up 10:45
good intro actualy
Good news it is almost a cock lmao
Hey Mark go mash a program execute button and see how well it works. He's running to the last place you pressed the call button.
Ending was beautiful
I love Freddy in this game I love him
I think I’m serious 11:47
Mark, there's an exploit that, if SWS doesn't patch it, you can get saves back. Grab the assistant driver head at Roxy Raceway and it'll reset to 5:15am but it'll still actually be 6am.
So they said (the workers ) they scrubbed Bonnie from everywhere but there's Bonnie on the walls in the theater
I love this so much this is so fun   Also the parts of Mark loosing his mind lol  I like the idea that a anamatronic is helping us in the game its super awesome😁
This game is very neat but holy crap this game is very buggy or janky.
The end was hilarious 😂
I'm crying I loved Freddie
Oh no I didn’t click on the links in the description what shall I ever do mark is gonna come find me oh no….*Squeals like a little school girl*
What if the events mark is talking about(like gameplay not being used) was from Scott Cawthon. He was working on the game, and retired. Now the team that is working on fnaf right now kept them in (either ignorant or did it for memory)
Wait so is there going to be another episode
The Monty sequence had me in tears. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
they really should have let you save after 6:00, trying to find other secrets seems SO infuriating
Me: crying because Freddy died Mark: did they run out of budget?!!
I personally think they still wanted to add more to the game than what is there
Fair bit of jank going on with this game. Hopefully this stuff gets patched out, the teleporting animatronics kinda sucks
Nobody: Freddy: Good News! It is almost a cock.
Please don't tell me that you mean you won't do another part when you said "I'm done"
Zi sure do love seeing Markiplier suffer
Vanny Ending: happens and has a neat stylistic difference Mark: *loud wheezing and confusion*
finish one shot
Me: I'm gonna stay blind to this game for when I play it   Also me: *on part 7*
I wonder if the stay option is meant to be like the sixth night that is in all fnaf games, where it slips into that harder difficulty setting i mean there's not much staff so the place could open later than 6am, to be honest i think they should have kept in the option to save in the stay option but! Cut the number of save points by say half as i think people would get annoyed and just choose to leave. I mean it would be frustrating as hell to somehow grab monty claws a few collectables then get caught only to have to redo it again from the choice bit.
28:41 Monty told freddy that gregory kill his friends so he just gonna run away!! Mark: Freddy!!! Freddy: I don't need you anymore bye
can someone please make a supercut of just the different times mark yells "FREDDY!" throughout this series?
Am I the only one who thinks Vanessa's voice sounds seductive when she says "go to the main stage"? It probably wasn't intentional but dear god
See y’all tomorrow probably
Okay, so now that Mark has gotten through one of five endings, there needs to be some clarification for how to achieve the other endings. He still hasn’t gotten the other upgrade for Freddy. Make no mistake, I know Mark will get to it soon. It’s the other comments about collecting the presents that bothers me. Listen, there is no need to get all those to get the endings, that’s just torture. He just needs to kill the other animatronic to get the other endings. Now about my theory about Glitchtrap, yeah I seemingly did some research on the topic. Yes,it is confirmed in this game that glitchtrap/springtrap/ William Afton is still in the game.  Now another theory about Vanny or as we the community refer to her as Vanessa. Keep in mind, this is solely based on research and my own thoughts. Vanessa is the last surviving member of the Afton family. Meaning Fazbear Entertainment, as well as all other subsidies are related to her and her father William Afton in a way. All evidence points to her having a split personality disorder from changing herself(which I assume she has given her childhood with her father whatnot).
Love how if you stare at moondrop he just aborts you
I wish there was a Vanny catches you ending if you went to the stage before having the 'should I stay or should I go' chat with Freddy.
My cheeks clenched at the jumpscare on mainstage
If you pressed “stay” it gets more interesting, trust me.
But I love how Freddy just runs past Mark like nothing and says noooope
"Because you enjoy my suffering" No, I enjoy the outright denial to learn to control your emotions and ultimately help your heart and brain in the long run that are constantly getting damaged from the rapid jumps in blood pressure and heart rate.
I find it funny mark flew by the Sister Location easter egg at 22:34 Baby just sitting there chillin.
There are 6 known endings one of which is the true ending.  Spoiler?:     This ending was the heroic ending.
freddy: im a runner im a trackstar
I cannot stand Mark's outros anymore, I am so sick of his dumb joke threats promoting his podcast and merch. I'm not interested in a stupid podcast or an overpriced hoodie.
Guys why dont i flinch or jump during a jumpscare? I just… blankly stare. 😰
It's amazing how Mark's brain just shuts down when he's on panic mode.  He could easily just... hide again, but no he had to pass through every security bot, and when he was on a hiding spot dart out of it just because.  Love Panic mode Mark, makes assessing the situation get thrown out the window in a split second.
Roses are red violets are blue your gaming system is hacked I’m watching you…
Markiplier playing FNAF is STILL the best thing ever.
he should play alan wake remastered
I- why the fuck did i cry when freddy died-
It's really great game design, having to zero-death the entire rest of the game to get an ending that doesn't suck.
hi
You should totally play control after this gameeeee
I think think Freddy stops everywhere u call him.and by constantly spamming the button he is going to keep resetting to get there so stop spamming it plz
28:40 for the funniest part of this video
The way I RAN for this video
Man this last segment really brings out these half baked game design decisions out extremely presently huh? What a slog this game is
Freddy: fucking dies Mark: lmao? what happened?
The second Mark went “I’m going to the recharging station” after the game very clearly explained that that was no longer an option was one of those moments where I sigh and say “we are going to be hearing about the broken recharging stations for a good chunk of this video...”
That first ending is so anticlimactic and disappointing
Mark, there are more endings. DO THEM FOR USS, PLEASE.
I’ll be honest the Freddie part made me cry
What a disappointing ending, It looks as if it wasn't finished on time :/
Mark..Mark, my man..Mark... if you spam the freddy button. You're screwing yourself. Every time you push the button you reset him.
Men this part is so hilarious 28:45 instead of Freddy rescuing Gregory he just left him, and Mark was like FREDDDY! 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Mark. Shoot. The. S.T.A.F.F. Bots. In. The. Head.  You can disable the staff bots like the animatronics, but they can only be disabled with a headshot
No cap freddie did em dirty
red haring
So, fun fact: you can upgrade Freddy's battery. The extra battery life makes the endgame so much easier.
28:43 Freddy is trolling!🤣😂🤣😂
I loved this video, especially the part where Freddy just ignored you when you need him the most
Okay guys I think we all know this but- Freddy is an ignorant child who dose not listen at all.  Edit: Oh my god lol I got sad at the end comic Like I was so sad to see Freddy die It got me emotional
Mark: FREDDY! I NEED YOU! HEEEELPPP!!!”  Freddy: 🏃💨🧍🏻‍♂️
the fact that some of the game mechanics are SO BROKEN is SO FUNNY TO ME- makes the game 1000% funnier (also super stupidly frustrating)
in the real ending u find the missing bb world arcade game 😏
Hey Mark, I heard that there’s a new Christmas phasmophobia update, you don’t have to do it straight away, but would you be able to get Wade and the others to do at least one more phasmophobia video? (after any other video plans you have of course) thank you
Mark at the end of the video:*I am fed up with this god damn game* ”You Better Click Those Links Dipshit, Or I Will Find You”
There's also another ending if you escape at the loading dock too so can you also do that??
He's back Again
I've never seen Mark so lost in a Five Nights at Freddy's playthrough than this one. Why do you keep running around with out Freddy? Just stay inside him.  "What? What's happening? Huh? What?"
This was such a bad game
"Maybe there was an issue with development"  *cough* toxic Twitter *cough*
Part 8, NOW!
why is there no jumpscare list!?
guess what mark, there's 4 endings! and you only got one of them
He laughs with confusion while the rest mourns Freddy😔 R.I.P he was a superstar
So there’s 2 exits.  Like 5 endings  And if you choose to stay, you can go back to get Monty claws to upgrade Freddy
I think that Freddy goes to every spot you call him to
Anyone else miss inscription
i have no idea how far in advance you record videos, but there was an exploit discovered where you can get the Staff Bot head from Roxy Raceway a second time, which restarts the quest and in doing so re-unlocks the ability to save even after 6:00AM.   I'm baffled why the devs thought it was fine to disable saving when one of the endings is ~1-2 whole hour(s) of new content so hopefully they patching saving in or at least never patch the exploit.
Gme: The charging stations have been disabled Mark: I'm gonna choose to ignore that because I don't like it
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bonnie Bowl has a disc where Bonnie’s display is, collect that and try to find a secret area. You also have to get the flash camera to enter secret places u haven’t yet explored. There’s another disc somewhere and a lot more. You might have to look it up or watch h20delirious stream, there’s a lot you and also there is a secret mini game in the room where the sun came out from and jumped into the pit
"Good News! it is almost a cock!."  Great work Freddy! i knew you could take care of those baby chicks!
MARK! IMPORTANT!  if you want to be able to save your game after the exit becomes available, so you can finish exploring and complete more of the game, you'll need to go and pick up that robots head again from Roxy raceway. you wont have to do the mission again, but it will reset the time and allow you to save without actually changing anything else
yyyyye
What I think might of happened was all of the people that were being impatient were yelling for the game to come out very soon so they probably scrapped most of the ideas for different locations and just released the game forgetting about some of the areas.
I may be wrong but i think the reason  freddy kept freaking out is because he runs to where  the player was at when they pressed the button and not where they are if you move
Game had some great ideas but failed to execute them and live up to FnaF name... In my opinion.
There is a bunch of different endings
Freddy casually walking behind Monty was the best thing ever
“FREDDYYYY YOU BITCH” IM CACKLING
Please do more inscription
XD watching freddy run by mark and leave him to die lol
I FEEL SO BAD FOR LAUGHING SO MUCH WHEN FREDDY JUST RAN PAST HIM  WHEN MONTY STARTED CHASING HIM IT WAS SO HILARIOUS PLEASE
what is that sound at 7:50??? its like uhhh it sound so familiar
i was watching the vids before this one then my sis said there was a new one so now im here
11:42 SOMEONE doesn't know how to listen or read does he? Freddy literally tells you the charging stations are DISABLED this time, you ding dong. HELLO!!!!! It's 6am almost, the time is counting down, you're supposed to actually leave, of course you're not going to be able to use the charging station!
danggg 3 hours agoooo
Me who is in tears of Freddy rising markiplier hahahahahahahha
Freddy you b*** made me laugh so hard
Yo Mark, Would u recommend this game to other gamers?
28:42 LOOOOLL
You know their are several endings right?
I have to admit, no save states if you choose to stay is UNBELIEVEABLY HARSH.
Mark you need to find where the secret ending is. Where you fall into the old fnaf from fnaf 3
“FREDDYYYY”😂
So do we get a part 8
I can't seem to find Gregory, Monty have you seen him anywhere?
"FREEEEDAAAAAAAY!!!"
Mark please go to bonnie bowl with freddy and walk up to the curtain when your inside him you unlock a sad voiceline
There is diffrent endings btw mark
The story of this game is so vague it’s impossible to understand anything
Mark franticly screaming "FREDDY" while being chased by Monty has to be my favourite thing
Mark, Freddy will go to the first spot you asked him to go before going anywhere else, that's why he just ignored you and pass by you while you were spamming the command button lol
FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYY
king has uploaded once again
Oh jeez here come the fanfics about Vanny
This game is so janky, it feels slightly unpolished. It looks amazing though
I think they are gonna add DLC. I’m 100% sure of it it idk if they’ll be free updates but I hope so. Because there’s A LOT going on in this game lore wise.
did anyome else just start bawling at “you are… my superstar” WHAT THE FUCK THATS NOT COOL THIS IS SO SAD
Mark...90% of your issues with the game are YOUR fault!
I really hope someone animates that last part
I do t think Mark ox enjoying this as much as we are
"FNAF: Security Breach - Part 7" or more like "Freddy ignoring Mark for whole 30 minutes"
Yey :))))
Is it me or was Freddy’s scream while being taken apart somewhat unsettling. Like very disturbing
*Guys... I don't think Markymoo liked this game very much...*
"i will find you" he says. yeah. sure. like freddy found him. lol poor soul but god was that not entertaining to see
Someone please animate when Mark gets chased by Monty.
mark screaming for freddy like a little kid would is the best part of this video
Mark: ...Wha... What happened?!           *Freddy fucking died, that's what happened*
Freddy seems to appear at your last known location. Really that’s on you, Mark.
Hi Mark will there still be inscription game play?
Freddy
Freddy: "NOTHING CAN HIDE FROM ME NOW!"  Mark: AHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
Alright, is NO ONE gonna talk about "Good news! It is almost a c*ck!" at the beginning?!
Hello Future people
Lol
you should have gone for the arcade game in vanny's office
Will he ever try to do the leave ending?
yea the comic-book endings don't do it for me either lol
Man this game has a lot of issues
Mark: "Click my links... Or I will find you... I will find you..."  Me: "Mark please! I already spend an obscene amount of money on CLOAK and listen to Distractible every week! Please stay away from my family!"
Please tell me he hasn’t given up on inscryption
XD poor freddy, mans gettting bullied left and right
Will you be able to get Monty’s claws?
You should upgrade Freddys battery life...
14:30 yo but like... did mark voice glamrock freddy? i mean like DANG DAS A SPOT ON IMPRESSION
The voice crack sounded like he inhaled helium 🤣🤣
:D
I hope mark does the true ending in the next episode where he has to do something it said I’m the duffel bag notes he has to do in order to get the true emdimg
Well Mark, there are 6 total endings. You got the destruction ending and you can also get the bad ending by picking leave at the part of the door. I’m sure there are a bunch of spoiler free endings guide of how to get the other endings
Markiplier  Strengths: FNaF, Running, Shooting, Commentary  Weaknesses: Reading important information, listening to important information, patience
50Gb+ and some endings consist of bloody comic strips. The endings are just the worst
Actually, in the middle of the  development for the game, scott cawthon gave up on being the main designer for current and future projects. this might've changed how some areas is utilized and used.
So there’s a secret ending with spring trap i don’t wanna spoil to much but I really hope you see this and try to get to it
Again this sh-t?? This game franchise sucks major balls wtf.. BORING! This is content for furies, nothing more! Ofc, mark is pushing this, views are kicking in..
Mark: calls freddy Freddy: runs opposite direction
Mark ily
Also there are 6 total endings
anyone else finding the games story to be highly confusing? like it feels like whole chucks are missing
Only Mark could do a classy ending while in rage quit mode.
mark the reason why the game feels polished at times but really bad at others is just fans rushed the game programers into giving them the game ad early as possible.
28:42 Top ten Anime Betrayals
BTW: The ending is comic styled because it’s not the true ending.
Hey uh Mark did you forget about Freedy's voice upgrade to stun Animatronic and looks like you forgot about the charge stations are disabled prior to 6am
28:44 omfg me breathe
Fnaf god vs security breach: part 7
The way my eyes widened when I saw Freddy being ripped to shreds😢
Mark's gonna come find us like Freddy is finding Gregory in this episode. He's just gonna zoom right by everyone for not clicking the links in the description
Welcome to Present Mark talking about how Past Mark messed up part 7
Gregory just came in and ruined the whole pizzzria at one night, thats great
really hoping mark find me because i dont click the link
Monty kills mark when freddy took foe ever  "FREDDY YOU BASTERD" you can hear the pain in this voice
Look around in "Roxy Raceway" for a door which leads deep underground, it holds the secret ending. The "True ending ". *The door is next to the area where you found the extra robot head* 🙂
Mark really got the Destruction ending 💀
29:15 Monty Python Gator show!!
I don’t get the no saving once you get to the stay option. There seems so much still left to do that you’d want to save. That just feels like artificial difficulty.
so just putting this out there, I think spamming the ABSOLUTE SHIT out of Freddy's call button I think fucking broke him a bit hard. It seems like when you ping Freddy he goes to where the ping was, and SPAMMING it doesn't really help
29:17 Mark's facecam would make a great thumbnail for a FNAF rage compilation video. If he (or anyone else) gets around to make such compilations.
When Freddy run pasts Monty while Mark is in danger 😂
Detailed comic plays at the end  Markiplier: (brain has left already) Did they run outa budget for the last part!?   Btw no mental breakdown can beat the one he had at the end of the second episode
The comments about Freddy running away are just... *chefs kiss*
Game: The charging stations are offline Mark: But what if they aren't
Sad how slow mark is uploading this series and that ppl are already spoiling insane looking endings in their thumbnails
This last moment of the game is so odd, I think it was rushed with how quickly it skipped to a cutscene without anything in between.
MARK!  L U C K Y  F L A N N E L
I can't even tell you how happy I am that these are being uploaded daily
The last seen was a comic because they tore apart a human, no one wanted to animate that
If you pick up the driver assistants head again, you can save the game again. Just a little tip if you keep on dying but want to see all the endings! (I do not know if it is patched or not but I know some youtubers still use this trick to save in end game.)
It almost felt like a Scooby-Doo episode when it was Mark Monty and Freddy running up and down the same sets of stairs lol 🤭
Mark: Freddy! Freddy! FREDDY! FREDDYYYYYYY! Freddy please! Get me in! Get me in! Freddy: *Sprints past Mark as fast as he can to try to save him being a bear on a mission.* Mark: FREDDY!!!! FREDDY YOU BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FREDDY!!!!! *Voice get's so shrill the screen cracks*  That just slays me thinking of all of that scene except it actually being Gregory instead of Mark.
I just got down with the flu and your SB gameplay has been comforting me through it. I know you were hesitant to play at first but I’m really happy you stuck through it for us.❤️
schadenfreude
I honestly did not know that Mark's voice could get so high pitched 😂😂 10/10
No lie future mark makes me thing I'm watching the emperor new groove where the emperor interrupts the movie. Solid movie by the way...
I love how we all collectively enjoyed the part where Mark was desperately screaming for Freddy while running for his life
feels like production was rushed and things weren't finished completely. Which Is sad cuz It could have been a great game. Like why would the boss fights only be video instead of you fighting them THEN putting the video when you won? Why are the endings in comic form instead of what every other cut scene was? Something definitely went wrong during production.
Security breach is like  Cyperpunk77 but freddy. It should’ve had more development, and it definitely seems it was rushed to be put out.
Freddy: dies Mark: Did they run out of budget???
No spoilers but two of the endings is comic book style
So Markiplier the Defeated.... 🤔
11:08 the game bugged you can see the real moondrop move behind you a few seconds before
This video presents the first time I've actually felt on edge during this series
Please get all the upgrades.
Man that was beautiful
How long until someone makes a clip of Mark running from Monty while screaming at the top of his lungs with the Benny Hills theme playing in the background?
the reason why there are areas is because if you were to get montys claws you'd have to go through different things than with roxys eyes because your getting two completely different things
Vanny tho Ayo
There is like 6 ending in the game
damnn vannys thicc
noob serial killer: chases victim  expert serial killer: want some candy?
I think when you call Freddy he goes to the location you called him from and not directly to you
i honestly think its like dead rising in that you could either choose not to do any missions and just wait till 6 and leave, or do all the missions fast as heck and get it all done before six, or if its your first playthrough like this is marks, manage to only do most the missions but still have a few left to be done when 6 rolls around. I could be wrong, but it just feels like that. and i loved that about dead rising, cuz it made it feel like it was your choice, and that you weren't just ding stuff to progress time in the game. 6 am was coming in dead rising whether you sat on your ass or not, and you can still finish the game, and i get the same vibes here when 6am rolled around.
List of steps for Mark to find all the other known endings:  Ending 1:  #1: Get monty's claws #2: Go back to Roxy's Raceway and find the other basement stairwell that's locked behind getting Monty's claws #3: Enjoy :)  Ending 2: #1: Go to Roxy's raceway, find her salon, and go in there. There should be a princess quest 1 arcade cabinet you can play in there. #2: Play Princess Quest 2, which should be at the back of the arcade where the giant spider DJ thing (aka Music Man), where the last breaker was before he chased you. Play that one. #3: Do the Vanny Ending, and the last Princess Quest arcade cabinet is in there.  Ending 3: You have to get security lv 7 (you can check at the top right of the map), the go to the loading dock at the kitchen and press the button that has a 7 on it.  Ending 4: People aren't fully sure yet what exactly you need to unlock the door for this ending, but people are 90% sure you need every golden plushy (I think there are 6) and then you can use the VIP emergency exit. I might be wrong. The VIP exit is in the VIP room, which you should be able to reach still.  That's all of the endings we know of so far, there might be another one no one knows about.  Edit: Idk if this will have an ending or not, but there is an arcade cabinet hidden behind a door that has the pirate foxy and a few characters on that door. To unlock it, you must take the camera from Monty's golf course security office. There are cardboard cutouts of the 4 characters on that door hidden around the pizzaplex. Find them and take pictures of each one of them (if you did it right, their eyes will become a white void). Once you've gotten all 4, go back to the room at the theater where the door is and the door should be unlocked. Inside you will find the BB arcade cabinet. Idk if you just need to play it or if you need to follow the glitch path on the arcade machine, but from what I can tell, after you do that, you can go back the the golf course and there is a mini golf arcade machine in there that you can play. I haven't seen anyone else do anything with it, but I think you have to beat the par score for every course or something to get something for it. Then there's the Chica arcade machine back somewhere, I don't remember where, but I have a feeling you'll be able to play that either after the BB thing or the golf course. There might be more, idk.
You gotta play princess quest in order.
17:57 is gonna be a meme template
Mark: FREDDAY! Freddy: –patiently waiting for monty to walk down the stairs–
Could it be that the injury you have in the beginning is a frontal lobe type injury
Mark giving a lot of reasons why he shouldn't just learn to be stealthy.
What happen ? Yeah good question
It is very clear after all these delays this game was still not finished. This is garbage
laughing at mark getting frustrated with the recharge stations even though either last video or this video it tells him that they're offline XD
30:00 It’s more the fact that Freddy is programmed to go to the very spot you call him to that’s an issue rather than it being a “bug” that he doesn’t stop at you. While it doesn’t make sense why Freddy wouldn’t stop once he makes it to you, that’s just how the game seems to be programmed.
*rapidly clicks on every link on description*
im not clicking the links, i dare you to find me B)
Imo disassemble ending felt super rush and was just really really bad, it made next to no sense LMAO
Mark: FREDDYYY!! Freddy: Nah im going for the snacks, byeeee
That's what you get for spamming Q
i rlly hope they remove that NO SAVE OPTION after 6 AM cuz i rlly hate that and its bad for collecting collectibles and lore so i rlly wish they remove that
8:10 no the actual reason is bc the video would be to short >:(       im joking btw volks
It's nice to see someone actually noticed how they ran out of budget for the ending.
I can’t wait for mark causing his own insanity compilation for this series!
honestly it is so hard watching him play this because he doesn't seem to understand how any of this works. bitching about Freddy not doing something he should know well enough that Freddy doesn't do.
ALMOST AT 1MILLION VEIWS
Markiplier remeber the princess quest arcade machines find them and complete them from 1-3 and there’s another ending
Here before you guys rewatch in a year
If you try to read the article on the newspaper at the end of the credits on the Vanny ending it says “blah blah blah blah blah. This article has nothing to do with anything relevant to the game. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
So, is he gonna go for the game's other endings? The way this video ended before the outro played seemed to me like he isn't gonna go through the rest of the game.
I wish you would cut more but besides that 10/10
When the ending him crying maybe it's emotional pain
thank you for the playthrough ! its perfectly okay if you dont chase after the other endings , hearing you yell freddy at the top of your lungs was all i needed to end the year. dont forget to take care of yourself !
More
the theatre is used in the Montgomery gator route
Presses Q-  Freddie: i’m running I’m running I’m running
damn was not prepared for the cock joke, made me spit out my w a t e r
It looks to me as though when you summon Freddy, he will go directly to the point you summoned him at, regardless of how you move after summoning him. But he will only answer summons in the order they were received, so if you're running from an enemy and spamming the summon Freddy button, you're just leaving a trail of false calls for him to answer.
The distant frantic clomping of Freddy trying to find him again makes me laugh so much
Was just listening and there was a good millisecond where I thought Freddy was about to say “You are my son.”
Does anyone know anything about the "Plan A" thing Mark got?
this game is in another level of unfinished, holy crap  i'm sorry for mark having to play through this
Listening to Mark screaming "Freddy!" Super high pitched as he dashed past him was honestly the high light of my year. His relationship with Freddy this playthrough was just pure wholesome comedy 😃🥰
“You are my superstar” SOBBING OVER THIS
Freddy is so nice
I’ve been watching Mark’s FNAF vids for a LONG time now, but I gotta say something is off.  Not with Markiplier, he’s AWESOME, but something about this latest game just isn’t sitting right with me.  I think it’s the tedium, but different than the others.  In the other games there was this CONSTANT fear of the jumpscare and the challenge to overcome it.  I don’t sense that here.  There’s so much stuff going on that I can’t keep up.  On top of that, the threat doesn’t feel…well….threatening.  I feel like this game had a lot of lofty ambitions and goals, but right now it’s coming across kind of messy.  It wants to do too much.
Game: Get to a recharge station Markiplier: And I'm just gonna ignore this
Markiplier saying “you serious” twenty times activated my siri because it thought it was “hey sirius”
Man, good thing they delayed the game a whole year so they could release a buggy, disjointed game with a horribly placed, practically nonexistent plot. That was close.
28:40 I laughed so hard at this part, oh my god!
Mark screaming for Freddy while spam calling for him is the funniest thing ive seen in a while LMAO  on a side note, what was that about disappearances Gregory was talking about when choosing whether to stay or leave????
You were very confused about the recharge stations being offline when it told you very specifically "the recharge stations at offline"
Who else was really impressed by Freddy's voice actor this entire game?
I guess Freddy really went back to his roots in this episode
The idea of this game is really cool, and it almost worked so so well, but because it didn't work "so so well" it instead turned out... kinda shit. Such a shame too, I was pretty excited for this.
I really liked how Mark kept screaming Freddy, and then when Freddy finally appeared, he just zoomed past him lmao.
Couldn't he have gotten all the parts before doing upgrades?
Freddy running up the stairs past mark is SENDING me
Please PLEASE someone put Benny Hill music over Mark repeatedly running around the stairs away from Monty
Even android lasts longer than freddy
28:42   MARK: :D FREDDY: SIKE!  MARK: D:
Funny how Freddy was considered one of the scariest characters in the original game as he had so much backstory and his golden Freddy counterpart and now hes our comfort character 💀
"FREDDDYYYY DONT WAIT YOUR TURN!!!!!!" freddy: mm walk
Mark straight up is not the king of this FNAF, my poor man is struggling
Please Mark, come find me, I dare you.
a lot of bug yes, it is
17:41 I WAS ABOUT TO SHED A TEAR AND MARK IS JUST THERE WHEEZING X_X
Does anyone else feel like Mark found a way to sequence break the game and that's why it's all glitchy?
everything feels so off in this game and i cant tell if its intentional or not. the entire place doesnt feel like its even meant to be a place where people get entertainment, and gregory and freddy are both so weirdly on the nose with all the events in fnaf that weve seen are usually covered up. gregory knows way too much, and freddy seems way too chill about that and also weirdly friendly with gregory for no reason. it feels like i am missing 90% of whatever the plot was intended to be
TO ANYONE READING THIS!! there are bot accounts in the comments, saying offensive shit to get people to look at their page. don't interact with it, do not give them the attention they want, report it !!!!!!!
Please finish this game mark it is absolutely hilarious to watch you play this
Lmao. Mark. It's not broken or a bug. Freddy  goes to where you last pressed the watch. Also the charging stations were disabled after Freddy got Roxy's eyes. Per provided text on the screen. 🤣 All that time looking for the front door when it's in the front lobby. I'm dying .
This game is not without its flaws. Even still, the potential is 100% there. Honestly, I feel like this game could have definitely used more development time, but I'm guessing there were factors pushing them to keep this release date, not even just pressure from the fans. Money, time, who knows.  You can definitely see the effort that was put into this game, it's just a shame about all the bugs. That Vanny ending is incredibly rushed, though.  First there's a pretty shaky transition to a 3D cinematic, then gameplay, and then a 2D comic-styled cinematic. All in the span of about a minute.  Regardless, I hope the game is in a better state in the coming months... or even the coming years. I know game development isn't easy, and it's impossible to iron out every single bug. Especially in a game as big as this, you can't account for everything. What you can't patch out is the story and overall gameplay, which has its shaky moments.  I feel like the game experience is different if you play it yourself. You probably get a better flow of the story playing out, as well as the scale of what you're doing.  But, in the end, I think this game has potential, and it clearly had effort put into it. It was just a case of overambition.
Hey mark, if you want to, to get some secrets use the faz cam on certain old cardboard cut outs to open a door behind an old foxy pirate movie poster. Good luck
Seems like this game was rushed for the holiday season
Freddy: *dies* Markiplier: HAHAHAHAHAAHAHHAHAHAWHAT
The way Freddy just barrels past Mark as Monty is right behind him lmao
they didnt patch anything mark, if u go in a charge you will always come out with freddy. you just wernt able to do it then cuz moon was after you
Game, "It's finally 6 a.m., you can escape now!" Markiplier, "no"
That ending was weird, just teleports you too Fazer Blast😂
markplier you don't have to get the collectables to get the true ending can someone inform him that he has to use the old elevator and there is a bunch a bunch more than 3 endings
Hold up, I'm confused. Did I miss the voicebox upgrade being used?
Who else cant wait for  Mark to do the secret ending
Hi
It’s so funny how Freddy just runs right past and Monty stops
Cory faster lmaoooooo august if you see this your gay and like men
I was like....he's finding all these collectable....he's gonna be upset when he gets caught. In comes Monty. Here it comes.....yup
mark was  so shocked when we didnt get montys hands
Once you get Monty's Claws, you should check out the Old Elevator (the one in the Roxy Raceway). If you go down there, you can get a new ending.
…. The amount of times marks has had to cut huge sections out of this videos because he was being a dumb-dumb is kind of sad.  It makes me question how he got crowned “The King of FNAF”.
Video 61 of asking Mark to play The Mata Nui Online Game
Freddy wants some payback because Mark laughs at him when he died.
Remember the toreador march
As fun as the game is and very aesthetically pleasing, the narrative is pretty hard to follow and the majority of gameplay is running around doing the same thing of not being caught, the main animatronics except Freddy and music man were pretty indistinguishable with the same gameplay for their section, and it was hard to tell where vanny fit into all of this as the big bad, Vanessa was a weird character that doesn’t seem to include much and the first ending mark got was just so… underwhelming, it seemed to be an enharmonic symphony of ideas which couldve been put together more coherently. Its hard to know how to feel about this game, it is important to see that the true values of fnaf- IE a pretty basic game with basic gameplay but very very good story telling, humour and breaks between nights to keep the player engaged with hidden Easter eggs- feels like it’s a bit lost with the cool graphics and big shot moments, i truly wish more care was taken to the narrative and endings and journey.  THIS IS NOT A HATE COMMENT I LOVE THE FNAF SERIES AND I AM A HUGE FAN!!!! BUT I CAN LOVE SOMETHING AND STILL HAVE CRITICISMS THIS IS JUST MY OPINION YOU CAN AGREE OR DISAGREE AS MUCH AS YOUD LIKE!
The real ending you’re looking for is Gregory getting a respectable and highly dangerous job at the pizzeria
Game: At this hour, the power was no longer diverted to recharge station  Mark: goes to one and wonder why it didn't work
Yo, there is multiple endings
This game is literally so weird. Some parts are kickass, like the whole giant Music Man sequence, and then parts like Mark's first ending look completely unfinished and rushed. I genuinely don't know if I like this game or not😵
Literally so frustrating to watch
Moment when Freddy run through Mark and go somewhere else was one of the funniest things that I've seen in a while, damn, that was gold :D
If you ever feel bad, remember that Mark saw Freddy run away from him while he was in danger.
omg my stomach hurts "FREDDY!!!!" "DONT WAIT YOUR TURN!!!"
I died when Freddy just ran past Mark while he was screaming for him XD
BRO I DONT WANNA WAIT FOR ANOTHER PARTTTT
What happened 🤷🏾‍♂️ What happened🤷🏾‍♂️ What happened 🤷🏾‍♂️ 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mark dodged Monty for so long on his own I wondered if he even needed Freddy lol that was a long chase sequence lol
Mark’s getting chased by Monty like no ones business, and Freddy out here like ight bro imma dip
Now I’m not going to click on it
freddy left him to his fate
28:00 Someone please animate this
I dont think they broke Freddy I think he doesn't run to you, he runs to the location you called him from. So if you call him upstairs then run downstairs he's going to run upstairs
Didn't seem like it knew what state of the game to put you in. Was pretty much just incoherent.
Mark: FREDDAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY Freddy: "Eat shit, superstar"
Mark:Freddy dont wait ur turn  Freddy:*slowly walks down the stairs with monty*
Who else died of laughter after Freddy ran right past Mark at 28:42
I think the game developers should've kept working on the game for a year or two to get all the bugs and problems out but hey, its literally the very first fnaf free roam game, it's not like any other fnaf game ever made and it could've easily have been worse so I still applaud it even with its errors.
freddy goes where you point at, doofus.
Ive said it befor ill say it again. This game is trash!!
"Your my super star" Me: *crying my eyes out*  Mark: *turns into a tea pot*
i’m legit shittinf tears rn
This episode was too short. And nothing was accomplished. Great.
I wonder if he will do all 6 endings
Mark After your done with security breach I would love to see you play one night at flumptys 3! Please I love to watch you play the fan games!
Freddy is such a father figure.
I have never laughed so hard when Freddy just fucking passed him
I like to imagine that the times when the cameras blurr out on the map it's the animatronics flashing the camera or something and the cameras are just like "NOPE"
"you are my superstar" be crying my eyes out. Mark laughing!
9:25 m-mommy? 😳.
Freddy: We are friends!  Mark: YOU SON OF A BIT........
I love the irony of there being a super sad line then just aggressive wheezing
Let's go security breach! 😃😊❤🖤💕💞🐻🐰🐤🦊
Come and get it, Noodle Arms! :)
I was wondering why this one was only 30 minutes 😂
I hope mark gets the Afton ending. Since it’s the cooler ending. Going back to the fnaf 6 location
Dude that ending felt like a fanfiction ending. Horrible pacing, cringey scenes, no emotion whatsoever. How the hell did that get put into this game.
mark: FREDDY!!! freddy: oh hello monty
My heart is broken at the vanny choice goddamn
Last famous words. "OMG FREDDY!!!"
This game really feels like a step down and so confusing. I don't even know the story at this point.
Looks like mark forgot Freddy can scream to disable mmechs
this game is litteraly unplayable... the frames are horrible, teleporting animatronics and it continuously crashes. They should have released the game in a stable state.. It doesn't make it alright if they just fix it later on. When you buy a product you expect it to work, not for it to be fixed up later on down the line. And its not just this game either, this is a consistent trend lately in all games, Im disappointed and I rate this game a 1/10, the story feels unfinished, it runs on a pre made engine, and instead of actually trying, somewhere down the line they changed the story and made the ending so cheesy and ran out of budget
What actually happened to this game is that Scott retired because he donated to republican candidates and they fuckin cancelled him.
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry at the first ending mark got 💀💀
28:41 Freddie be like I think I left the stove on at home brb
Mark getting chased by Monty: *FREDDY HELPPPP!!* Freddy: After you, Monty!
My thoughts of why some parts are as polished and why the game seems like it could have been different or it was going to be different is because Scott Kaufman got canceled because he gave money to Trump's political running and when people found that out they canceled him they threatened his children him his pregnant wife and they harassed him until he said that he would no longer work on five nights at Freddy's
If marks finding skills are as good as Freddies I’m not worried.
To make your playthrough easier, you could have used the lift up to the stage and then ran to the elevator on the opposite side of that section. From there it is a literal straight shot to the exit.
THATS IT ?! THAT CANT BE IT !! I NEED MORE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT ?! I NEED ANSWERS
That was so creepy when Vanny ordered the robots to disassemble Freddy. And that comic at 17:10 was really sad
Will you make another video on this? I really love watching them and i'd like to see more parts of you staying.
15:11 that part killed me marks face is just pure confusion
hopefully he will do another play through to see the alternate endings. this is a choose your own adventure game anyways
you should of seen the leave{bad} ending
I like how part references how to get to the true ending in one of the notes
If someone is talented enough and has some free time. please animate the final monty chase and freddy's betrayal at the end. We'd like the ever loving sugar honey iced tea out of it.
i’m sorry but me and my brother both burst into laughing when freddy said “you are my superstar”
I don’t know if anyone has noticed but Sun and Moon are different animatronics, Sun has 5 fingers on each hand and Moon has 4…
theres 7 endings mark LMAO
This game feels like Scott bit off more than he could chew (and it's not even '87) and the FNAF ideal got too big for its britches.
If this series ends here I’m gonna be so mad he needs to try to get every single ending
Maaan this not over yet? Call me when it’s over lol
WELCOME TO THE EPIC SCAM SHOWDOWN. IN THIS I WILL LOOK AT ALL THE COMMENTS IN THIS COMMENT SECTION AND SEE WHO HAS PLACED THE MOST BOTS!             THE RESULTS ARE IN AND...................                       THE ONE WHO HAS THE MOST BOTS IN THIS COMMENT SECTION IS KOGURII! CONGRATULATIONS KOGURII I HOPE YOU'ER SEING THIS. AND SEE YOU ALL IN THE NEXT MARKIPLIER VIDEO bye
I don´t care it is bugged, I freaking laugh so hard when Freddy passed Mark focused on reaching the location marked by him earlier while Monty kept chasing him my god XD
I feel like alot of the things your blaming the game for... Are problems of your own causing. When you call freddy he teleports... so when you spam call him he just keeps teleporting. You refuse to avoid the security bots / hide in the million objects around the areas. You ignore any information being verbally thrown at you.  Could the UI / quests be more distinct / helpful. Sure? But that would mean the games holding your hand ALL THE TIME. Which I'm not sure would make the game better.   So far in this playthough (from an outsider looking in / hindsight and all that) there has been lots of times where the game has been like "hey go here and get this object" and you've gotten yourself side-tracked on your own 'lore' theories and died lots. Deaths that I can only assume are souring your experience. Like the game tells you to get rid of Moon you just need to hop in a recharge station... Moon as a character is a timed event that kills you at the end of the timer. He WILL catch you. Regardless.  Anyway maybe i'm just over-thinking this. You probably bulk-recorded this stuff.  I hope you take a bit of a break from it (yaknow step back) - than come back later to find the hidden ending.
Mark's being really nice, and to be fair, he cam be an idiot sometimes. But I feel like this game really should've explained some of this shit better
youtube needs to get the comment bots under control 😟
YSASS  WAS WAITING FOR THIS ONE just finished part 6 3 hours ago
I hope grittysugar animates this episode...
Princess Quest 1, 2 and 3 hold much significance, I recommend finding them in order and playing them
there were so many hiding spots and mark just ran past all of them to get away from monty
10:46 my soul flew out of my body along with Mark lol
hhhfhfhshsb mark there was a button on the main stage
mark you missed the other vanny ending  you need to play the game on the computer at the same place
The way Freddy just ran past him and Monty was hilarious 😂
god this game is so bad. its literally baffling. its such a fucking shame too like this couldve been so good
i know there is a glitch to save after the the final dicision but i dont remember how to do that exactly, something about the roxy race way and getting the head from one of the robots.
Unless they patched the glitch you can SAVE by collecting the robot head. Let me tell you it is HOURS of work to get where you want to get without saving. You will die repeatedly.
Mark you can save in the endgame by using a bug; if you pick up the crash dummy head from Roxy Raceway and try saving the game with it, it'll work :)
That Vanny ending was so rushed and low budget it was awful 😂
The way he screamed for freddy's help had me weak i laught so hard. But i laughed my ass off when freddy ran past mark, i just felt how mark got cheated on 🤣🤣🤣 thanks for the amezing time mark 💯
I think part of the reason this game seems a bit wonky with pacing and how it's handled is the fact that Scott kinda retired halfway through development
I am so sad it is all coming to an end
7:28 When even the air jumpscares you
12:22 i was about to drink water my water bottle was open so it almost spilled everywhere thanks Moon man
PRINCESS QUEST MARK
But.. I thought you were the FNAF king?! You gotta finish or I won't be able to sleep at night 😂
ok
Afterall... Who is Vanny? So many questions about game... I hope so Markiplier pass global game.
vanessa: come meet me at the main stage mark: v a N E S S A V A N E S S A
gotta do another video mark
@28:42 plot twist Freddy never wanted you to leave
I burst out laughing when Mark was yelling “FREDDY!!” so frantically while he was getting chased by Monty 😂 that was amazing
Mark: FREDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYY *summoning him 50 times* Freddy: Coming from 2k miles away Mark: FREDDY YOU LITTLE BITCH!
Yeah, the endings you get in this game aren't all that awesome...
And Moon Man be teleporting thru walls :) That's what happens when ur a puppet-based character in the FNAF franchise.
Mark infuriates me in this series
Please can you do the true ending mark? I have no idea how to do it but im sure someone knows how
Not being able to save after staying is just absolutely terrible. I’m glad I’m watching this and not playing it
It's glichtrap from the vr game
Mark laughing when Freddy died reminded me of when my friend and I went to watch the last Maze runner movie. Theresa died and my friend started laughing uncontrollably.
i looked up online that this game has 6 DIFRENT ENDINGS, WTF?
There are multiple endings mark I don’t know how to the get the good one but I’m sure you will find it I’m enjoying watching you figuring all this out
Mark ya got the bad ending the first time, the secret ending is the stay option, and leave is the good ending
There are Mulitple Endings
This vanny ending is the reason all the animatronics try to kill you now
the captions saying “daddy” @3:52 instead of freddy had me dying lmao
seeing as how the LGBTQ community threatened to kill Scott's wife and child if he didn't retire, I would say there was a sizable issue with SB's dev cycle.
Love Marks reaction when he clicks on the "Vanny" option.
I will say, I don't like that they disabled saving at this end bit. The entire Chica eyeball upgrade thing is basically meant for collectible hunting, but without saving, one fuck up- like what happened at the end- means having to collect all of the missed collectibles all over again. You can't save after installing the eyes, however, which makes the entire upgrade almost completely arbitrary or too risky to be worth really taking advantage of. I really, really enjoy this game- for the most part- but that one thing just feels like a cheap attempt at difficulty increasing. Like "the game's been ramping up, but we're out of methods to make it harder, so we'll just disable saving lolololol".
Freddy running passed you on the stairs made me laugh way too hard! LMFAO
Mark: "So the party pass will get me to the watchumahoosit"  me: "yeah yeah, i know what you mean"  also me: *wtf is he talking about*
14:00 Wait...there have been disappearances? Have I completely missed a plot thread or is this some remnant of an old version of the script?
Obviously you took in Vanny too early first time because Freddy wasn’t fully upgraded so he lost
You need to collect golden plushies without dying in hardcore mode then go to the vip exit in el chip's arcade
I havnt laughed so hard in a while. It been a long time since hes raged this hard. 🤣
he didn't even go to the main stage, he we to a stage, but it wasn't the MAIN stage.
I always think that Scott retirement have quite an impact to the game
Lmfaoooo Mark repeatedly screaming like a maniac for Freddy while being chased by Monty had me wheezing so fucking hard 💀😭
Mark go grab the head in Roxy's raceway again so you can get saves back
FREDDY! FREDDYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!
I like how in his playthrough ending he ran into like a million issues with the game at once.  -jumpscare glitch -scrapped story left in on accident (mission notif + checking stage) -lack of story entirely (vanny stage + him thinking they wouldn’t end so abruptly) -lack of direction  -moon blocking hallways randomly and teleporting in front of the player  -so on I forgot and don’t feel like rewinding😎 -wait nvm also the random vanny ending option  -random cutscene teleporting you from the entrance to laser tag arena -lack of explanation behind vanny randomly controlling robots -no story explanation at all and a laughably bad ending for the vanny option  Just him being honest with how much he dislikes the game’s choices is so nice to see but him being optimistic that theres something more even in a true ending hurts
This series is amazing
Mark I gotta say your assessment at 19:00 About what really being the true ending is spot on, you gotta get Montys upgrade and then find your way to the true ending of the game. There are 7 total, but if you want the *true* ending you're gonna have to stay and continue.
Alrighty, for everyone going after and attacking the channels that are leaving “MARKIPLIER IS GARBAGE” know that those are not people, they are in fact bots targeting and using small channels to spread hate.  You can tell this by clicking on the post and looking at their ‘videos’ tab, if it’s a bot there will be nothing there. You can further confirm this by looking up their actual channels to see there IS content in their ‘videos’ tab.  I’ve seen so many of you straight up harassing them and sending them hate, even causing a kid to cry.  So for god sake check if it’s a bot before you start attacking people for nothing!
FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
i got an ad for an NFT halfway through the video ha
Hey Mark. If you take Freddy down to the parts & service hallway security room. (The place with all the Endo's that act like Weeping Angels from Dr. Who). Freddy starts an interesting conversation with Georgie. It's not Lore per say, but I think you'd find it really interesting.
There are multiple endings and only one of them is the true ending
I feel like this game is very very big and not fully utilized because of Scott. Everyone knows he retired from the franchise but still works behind the scenes. I feel like it was a full game then Scott got ahold of it behind the scenes and started telling the developers to add/replace things and this is what we ended up with. It’s not bad, just off.
I think the main issue is that Freddy isn't supposed to be used as a last-minute safe spot to jump in while the player is getting chased; he's supposed to be a safer mode to travel from place to place, used sparingly.   When you're actively being pursued by an animatronic, most other YouTubers I've seen had a lot more success just hiding away and waiting a few seconds. The game definitely doesn't make this clear though, so that's on them.
FREDDY YOU BASTAAAAAAAAARD!!!!!  🤣
29:12 Imagine being Amy and hearing Mark screaming like this. also 28:43
What about 3 scary games ? :/
Mark screaming for Freddy like when a kid is waiting for his mom in the store line when its getting awfully close to pay
lol good news it is almnost a cock
Because of this game I had to go and watch every episode of the older Five Nights games you've played 🤣😅 not sorry...
so many people are making fun of mark for spamming the freddy summon button but it's the game's fault for having such a shitty system in the first place
There are 7 endings! Please Mark try to beat them all’
Come find me then mark!
i like to think the comic strip endings are just a creative choice, but it’s also so funny to just think that was their only option because the budget was cut
Freddy: the charging stations are now locked down Mark: it says get to a charging station!
can't wait for Mark to get the other ending
Petition to make mark replay for a specific egg in Bonnie’s diner
The king of fnaf has yet again completed a nother fnaf game
Stop Freddy is the father I wish I could have
The way I've completely fallen for Freddy with this game is crazy. The way as a animatronic he's protecting Gregory from the only other human in the pizzaplex is crazy too.  He has my heart now.
Early!
"FREDDY!! FREDDY YOU BITCH!!!" I can't stop laughing 😂
FREDDDAYYYYY FREDDDDDDDYYYYY FREEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYY?!?!?!?!?
I still can't believe Mark finished the Vanny ending than the easiest Runaway ending lol
Freddy: “you are my superstar” Everyone else: *crying* Me and Mark: *laughing*
this fucking game is so funny in the most awful ways
"You are my superstar.." broke my fucking heart 😭
I am crying!! Dad no!! You were my Superstar too!!!
"The recharging stations will no longer protect you" Mark: "I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that"
Freddy walking right past him was so hilarious XD. Ig fnaf is a rage game series now
FREDDY YOU BASTARD
Freddy was like, "You're on your own!" When he passed Mark on the stairs running from Monty
Not gonna lie, this game seems like a bit of an unpolished mess compared to the rest of the series
feddy :(
i laughed my head off at the end of this video with freddy running right past him and mark just screaming
You know they fucked up the ending when you got the most emotional guy on the platform LAUGHING at the main character dying in a little orphan’s arms
Yeah I’m on my 5 play through on my twitch and the patch that came out messed it up so bad
i cant wait for some animator to animate that freddy chasing mark
yeah there are multiple endings, some are less noticeable then others for sure
I've watched this entire series and basically suffered just like you Mark. As a fan of FNAF, it really does suck to see the games in the franchise holding to none of the original values and falling into the same corporate traps every game in development that gets big does nowadays. Unfinished releases, stories that feel secondary to gameplay, arbitrary systems that don't ultimately mean anything than to increase time played, etc etc.  I've also been suffering because an actually good game is waiting for you to finish it. The rest of inscryption awaits, although with the recent episode of Game Theory, maybe putting the game down is the right choice. Lol
6 more ending
“LITERALLY A RED HERRING”  a red herring is a fish 😭
Hi I'm here!!!!
hwat????
28:39 Mark: F R E DDD  YYYYYYY!!!
DID YOU KNOW That there's a battery upgrade for Freddy? AND You can glitch back into the Daycare? You can't go down the slide though. Sunny's already got that covered.
It said the charging station will not protect u
Rather than broken entirely it seems more that they made it such that you can't use him to get out of dangerous situations
I do
Mark got the really dumb ending first. The endings in general for this game suck ass
Mark: I'm gonna do the the thing where I jump in the charging station, I might just automatically hop in with him.. Nope! They patched THAT?!  Didn't it say in last episode that the stations are out of power or something?
the "ending" made me actually cry and now i dont know what to do
Me watching Mark go to the daycare: Nononononono, Sun said you were BANNED! Me, seeing he get's killed later on: Oh no he went to the daycare.
Mark it has been an honor watch the King of Five Nights At Freddy's at work. Thank you for this amazing experience 🥲
Wow.......another game that make Mark's rage. Unlike other youtubers just playing relaxing.
Sometimes Mark's lack of attention bothers me. The game DID tell him the recharging stations were all disabled because it was almost 6AM.
I feel like Markiplier's going to keep playing until he gets the good ending or the true ending because knowing him, it's in his nature
So rude to have the final outro scene to be Freddy being ripped apart
I agree with his thought that alot must have been cut. Way to many extra areas that aren't utilized at all for it not to be the case. Obviously not every area needs to have a part in the story, random exploration is fun and fine, but there's a bit to many for that to be the whole picture. Some are definitely setup and designed in a way that it'd only make sense for them to originally have had a part to play in the story.
I call bullshit on the choice. If wasn't too temperamental, i'll just cry instantly with the first bad ending, now i cannot avoid being disapointed and hold myself up, Even before christmas
I keep coming back to watch the end, it's just to fucking funny
I lost it at "Good news, it is almost a 🐓"
Markiplier is 7 episodes deep and still hasn't figured out that Freddy goes to where you summon him, not to where you are
Watching Mark screaming and getting chased by Monty as Freddy not listening and cooperating was the funniest moment in this entire playthrough
I laughed so hard when Freddy passed him lmao
To be fair in marks defense....they seriously Fudged up the ending here with the lack of saves, its not scary or tense its frustrating and absolutely stupid. Espeically at the end when you can leave. You can choose to stay and then you cant save at all! And there is so much more to do still? Thats a chore and not what anyone calls fun.
Still mixed feelings about Freddy...
We need to replace the flinstones boss with Mark yelling for Freddy, and maybe Snake as well...Someone please make those happen and post them. Thank you
80%:mark yelling" FREDDY!" 10%:mark finding the exit 5%:mark getting caught by staff bots 5%: mark finding collectables
Yay here early
Let me explain, the fake endings are comic books, there is one ending that you need all the upgrades to get, and is animated in 3d rather than a comic strip. It is most likely that this is the real ending. The comic book endings I believe are fake
Mark’s consistent uploads for this game is the only thing getting me through my week so thanks for that man
Mark really doesn't want the game to (an) ending without maiming some Monty Alt title: the beginning of end: part 1
I just think they made that ending a comic cuz they literally rip Vanny apart lmao. It would be too graphic and gory. Idk just my theory
there are 6 ending Mark, you got the true ending now you need the rooftop ending, best ending, and bad and good endings
Top 10 anime betrayals number 1: markypoo and Freddy
28:44 Mark being chased by a murderous animatronic. Freddy: 🏃 💨
So funny that mark doesnt understand that he was going for secret path all along
I just realized something back when I was in 3rd to 4th grade I played pretend fnaf in real life on the school playground and I made a perimeter surrounding the area of the "pizzeria" and if you were an animatronic and went outside the perimeter then you'd power off   Back then I accidently predicted an ending of security breach
This guy used to be a really good youtuber, but he literally just sat through the whole ending with literally no emotion at all. Mark Zuccerberg? Nah dude Mark IPLIER is the robot.
Yeah, There's a lot to this game, I know, Because my YouTube recommendations spoiled as much as it possibly could
I would absoluyley love it if mark came to find me
Just wanted to put my thoughts down here because I think the fandom being able to publicly see the disgusting way they're treating Mark is important.  I do agree as a viewer it can be frustrating to see him struggling a lot to navigate this game all through these parts, and in many instances spend a lot of his time just trying to figure out objectives / what he is supposed to do. And there is a lot of comparisons being thrown around to other youtubers' playthroughs which is really cool that you guys are enjoying their content, but why does it have to be compared to how Mark plays it? Mark has played every single FNAF game to come out, and is constantly pressured to do so by others and whilst none of us can say for sure whether he wanted to play this game of his own volition or not the fact of the matter is that people would be disappointed in him for not playing a game, which is really sad and shows where we are as a youtube community.  As for the game itself, there is a lot to be desired not just in the buggy aspects but also navigation and storywise - there are legitimate issues with making things clear so you can scream about how Mark isn't getting something all you want but the way the game is laid out IS confusing, and because it is so vast and demands for you to move from place to place most of which is just back and forward motions with no visible waypoints it becomes confusing. People might think I'm giving Mark too much credit but I think it's fair to say lest for maybe the washing machine part that most of the times he's struggled with navigation has been the game INCLUDING this episode. The time limit itself also imposes a level of stress alongside randomly deciding that you have to hide from Moon with no access to power stations 'because it's 6 am' is really unfair.  This probably doesn't all make perfect sense but I just wanted to put it out there that I'm pretty ashamed of the way some people have been acting, comparing him to other youtubers, pressuring him to play this game, being upset that he doesn't like it (when the game is actually unbearably buggy and storyboarded poorly, with a sprinkling of story and lore). The best selling points are the voice acting, and it uses that to distract us from the fact the game is half baked and incredibly bad. And Mark as a consumer and someone who has played a lot of video games (if he does feel this way) has a right to be dissatisfied with certain moments in the game that are lackluster such as with the AI being incredibly buggy and the game being very unfair with save points for certain things and then deciding it wants to be very kind with them at other points. I'm writing this in hopes that people will just sit here, appreciate the fact Mark is playing the game and let him enjoy it however he wishes to, true ending / all easter eggs or not. Lots of love to those of you not imposing your pressures and judgements onto Mark. :)
Was toy baby always there?!?
Mark’s suffering is practically our sustenance at this point.
Yezzzz another security breach
Why they have to give vanny a skin tight rabbit suit and do that little pose at the end lol stop
I think there was something about the racetrack like ground collapsing or something. I heard there was some stuff in there but not sure.
Grab the head in Roxy’s Raceway! You’ll reset the time and be able to save and progress further without worry
if we decommission Monty, Freddy will fight the bots I think, and then he won't be destroyed and we catch Vanny, yay :) (spoiler) I'm excited to see mark seeing the Afton ending for this
Do the "leave" option first...there's always more than one ending as you know
Mark I listen to distractable how dare you question my character
Mostly really enjoyed this series but the sheer amount of repeating yourself over and over, even in this episode alone, was grating
It seems like Freddy goes to the spot where you first summon him, kind of like a set route that he has to complete each time you call for him? So if you call him to point A, where you currently are, but move to point B before he gets there, he’ll go to point A and THEN point B, as an example?? So spamming the summon Freddy button and running around instead of waiting for him obviously won’t… work. At least, that’s what I’ve gathered from each episode so far LOL (I noticed that Freddy will go into each location Mark was previously in when he summoned him and each location he spams it in before reaching him)
I like how this whole episode Markiplier has no idea what is going on
I like how Monty can Pounce towards the player. I wish each animatronic had a unique mechanic like that from the beginning of the game.   Since mark got the stun gun (which can basically shoot forever) the game has felt a little bit underwhelming , honestly. If it was one shot with like a 3 minute cooldown it would’ve been fine, but right now there was no need for mark to ever use Freddy to move around or use the security cameras from his fazwatch.  Also that Vanny option was so wierd like what the heck ? 😵‍💫  The graphics are stunning (even if a bit laggy fps wise), but I can’t bring myself to actually like this game. I’m enjoying the videos because of Mark, not because of the story/gameplay.
Ive never laughed harder before a game over
The last 2 minutes of this video is the best thing I've ever seen lmao.  FREDDY!!!!!!! 🤣
RIP earphones users 28:45
yooo I cried when Freddy said 'ur my superstar' like bro
I thought this game would be easier than custom night but nOoOoo
To put it simply, the game wasn't finished.  There is a glitch you can do that lets you save again. All you have to do is pick up the damaged head again in the racetrack area.
When Freddy ran past him like that
FREDDY NOOOOOOOOOOOOO 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
28:35 dying
I hate this “troll community”  There are very entertaining and funny ways to troll, and I’m fine with trolling. But this is to much, theres a bunch of comments saying such as “jacksepticeyes dad deserves it” or “Markiplier is garbage” I’m fine with trolling but this is just harassment. Especially since there saying that YouTubers DEAD PARENTS deserve to die, this isn’t trolling. Its cyber bullying that should honestly be treated with jail time
Mark, there are several endings.
"You are my superstar" *U N C O N T R O L L A B L E  S O B B I N G*
What would be better is you finish the Gator part first then put in both the claws and the eyes at the same time
The yell at the end lol🤣
28:41 Mark: freddy please let me in dear god help Freddy: oh hey greagory *zooms away*
my sister didn't click the link go get her Mark
That's what I have been saying it looks like they rushed the game for release and never really polished it that we LL
Still mad at the fact you can't save after 6am
Markiplier try to find all golden plushies and golden  moondrop mask  and play and complete all princess quest those will get you 2 more endings
When freddy ran past mark, I lost my shit.  "FREDDY YOU BITCH!!!”
wonder if there will be another episode tomorrow
Mark : being chased by Monty   Freddy : runs right past him
Right when I want to sleep...  Its almost 3 am where I live
Let's motivate Mark to play another episode with a *controlled shock*
I feel ya there, the game sorta feels "rushed" per say. I love the details and all but the game feels really short and like scrapped ideas. We were supposed to have boss battles, too, yet I didnt see any during the gameplay. Like don't get me wrong its still a fantastic game, but I feel like they wanted to do more but fell short on time perhaps?
12:36
Mark, there is a glitch back at the raceway, where you can recollect the bot head at the boxes, and it will reset your time back to 5:00AM allowing you to save again. Also, you will not have to go back and do the raceway all over again, as you still have all your items and quests as they were before.
Mark made this final part so much harder than it had to be out of anybody I’d seen 😂 geez kinda hard to watch mark make a choice
Go to Vanny's room and play the arcade game
That end card is * Perfect *
So mark wont see this but he must know there are 6 endings in the game and when you pick stay you can pick up a head from the go kart thing before that allows you to save again for some reason. There is a FNAF pizzeria under the establishment.
I know I’m like 2 hours late but when Mark was saying “ What happened?! What happened?! W h a t  h a p p e n e d?!” All the lights in my house went out.
It’s sad that Freddy dies.
30:15 "I will find you - unlike Freddy"
Play it again pls there are more secrets in the game
Freddy is summoned to the location you press the "summon freddy" button .-. spamming it is what bugs him out
If you collect the damaged head it glitches the game and let’s you save at the end so it’s not as difficult
hmm that first ending... they pull an NGE move there
10:49 when moon killed you i had a fork in my mouth and it scared me 💀
Ima go ahead and drop the ball and say it, this game is COMPLETE SHIT
guys if u see advertising bots just report them no need to give them any attention 😌
“In memory of our friend, Mike Hoffman”. Can someone explain what happened to him?
Mark: BECAUSE IM THE KING!!! OF FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDDYS!!!  I will never forget to say mark like that
Considering Dawko needed help getting the ‘true’ ending I’m not sure Mark is gonna find it ^_^’
pretty sure there are like 5 endings lol and you haven't seen a lot of stuff and it is something
God this games story and endings are such major failures of the franchise.... No properly animated cutscenes except for one ending which itself has NO FUCKING PROPER ENDING TO IT while the whole thing itself makes no sense, The story itself is told through garbage collectables or at least the backstory. This whole game essentially adds nothing to the universe, the world or anything. It's a game clearly made entirely of ex pixar animators, not story boardists.

I was screaming at my phone because I knew what he had to do.
The FNAF king strikes once again always finishing the game
oops i didnt click the link :flushed:
You're going to continue the series right?
I wonder what happens when you pick leave
Mark in this whole video: FREDDY FREDDY NOOOO
Vanny/Vanessa just literally got all her organs and limbs ripped out/off while she was still alive
Collecting all giftboxes and using an emergency exit will give you an ending. So will upgrading freddy to the max and entering a specific staff only door in Roxy Raceway, a door tucked away in the corner Completing the princess quest games will give you another ending. You can leave by the loading docks at 6 AM with Freddy for an ending also.  There is also a whole thing with Retro CDs, which you can learn about when you collect them in the pizzaplex. There should be at least a few on each level of the pizzaplex, being 16 in total. It's safe to say Freddy might come in handy for this. *EDIT: The last 2 CDs that weren't collectable without a glitch are now able to be collected in the newest update.*  Upvote this so Mark can see!!
I feel like the Freddy AI is fucking broken as all fuck
This intro was a YTP lmao.
Game: *showcasing a tragic and sad ending*  Mark: *dying from laughter*
FREDDDDDYYYYYYY
hii
There is one secret in the game that I know about so in the Theatre At the very end there is a poster with Foxy Bonnie Freddie and chica There’s a bunch of cardboard cut outs of them If you have the Farrs cam Take photos of all the cut outs then something out of the cut out should be glowing and then when you found all the cut outs and took and photos of them Go back to the theatre then Back to that poster   with all of them on it everything should be Glowing on that poster and it’s a secret door that leads to sun room And there is another And there’s a secret in there there is a game that has a glitch in it and you gotta find it
Play the other endings!!
Wa- wa- wait a minute wait a minute,when mark got chika dump into the trash home xD idk whats it called but mark got chikas voice box but mark didnt use it to upgrade i think? it means he will get 3 upgrade when he saw this comment and do the same thing again and then when he got montys claw or idk when monty got disasembled he will get the 4 upgrades and fght the bots?...notice this mark
*Mark:* FREDDY!!! *_*spams call button*_* *Freddy:* *_*sees several hundred locations to run to*_* ...he'll be fine >.>
Man I wonder if Princess quest will ever have its first game found or I wonder where that weird elevator went to they talked about in the message
"What happened?" = My life.
Lmao, Freddy straight up charged up the stairs like "excuse me I'm being paged"
I watched the whole playthrough that moistcr1tical did about a week ago so I knew that the inevitable disappointment was going to be extraordinary. It sucks that they let the budget run out for the ending, because none of the endings are any good at all. 🤦‍♂️😂
you can just lickly revert steam versions
28:43 I fell of my chair laughing
there's 6 different endings!!
Mark: Spams the "HELP ME Freddy!" button Freddy: "Ok Gregory, I'll come to you starting at the first position that you called."
fredddyyyy. FREDDYYYY. FREDAAAAYYYYYY. freDAAAYYYYYYY
Theres gonna be DLC so maybe they'll expand more on it
i appreciate mark's playthrough, because I know that if I played this, I would probably do the exact same things and have the exact same frustrations. My memory sucks. Throw in a big confusing building and a difficult to read map, and, well, I wouldn't ever get anywhere.
People are complaining about mark not pay attention to instructions but the game explains where to go or what to do VERY POORLY.
Is mark going to do all the endings????

People mocking mark for summoning Freddy 1000 times as if that's a defense for this trash system lmao
i laughed so hard when freddy just walked passed Mark and Monty.
oh no.. i haven’t clicked on the link.. sure hope mark doesn’t find me in OHIO.. so scared oh no..
GOOD NEWS! IT IS ALMOST a CoCk
How you just gonna stop posting inscription 😪
umm... do you realize that Vanny is a human, right? So... if the S.T.A.F.F. bots decomissioned Vanny, well, that means that they ripped apart her arms, head and everything inside... holy hell.
hi :>
28:42 "I THINK I DROPPED MY WALLET OVER HERE!"
PLEASE PLAY MOORREEE
Gods, this is one of the glitchiest games I've seen to date. It feels like a really early beta, or even alpha with how clunky it is.
Man, this game really is a broken mess. Feels like for every problem fixed 5 new ones crop up. That entire end sequence just looks like infinite jank.
The best part was when mark was calling freddy and when freddy ran by him mark yells "FREDDY FREDDY DONT WAIT YOUR TURN FREDDYYYY
You are my rockstar
I feel a good animation coming from this vid, just mark yelling FRRREEEDDDYYYYYY while we see him just chilling doing something just ignoring him while Monty is casing him all over the place
I lost it; I WAS GOING TO CRY when they disassemble Freddy.
I don't know if this is still able to be done, but you can go to the Rroxy raceway and retrieve the driver assist bots head again, which enables save spots.
Just hearing Mark scream for Freddy to come was like a betrayal of Freddy to me.
11:42 are you serious?😏
There are SO many dumb things (glitches and bad design choices) that have happened in Mark's playthrough so far. How is it possible these weren't discovered in playtesting? How were these not fixed?
It was so annoying when it literally told mark he can’t hide from the moon guy in Freddy and he can’t use the charging stations rn
He forgot to kill Monty MARKKK
The ending sucks, could of been an amazing game. Just needed more and the ending is such a disappointment.
Mark if you get all the upgrades look for an underground elevator.
27:30 the funnest shit i seen
I cried of laughter when Freddy completely ignored you HAJSHAHAHAHAHAHA
Poor Mark... You can feel a piece of him dying off with each video of this he's uploaded.
28:40 THE WAY HE COMPLETELY WALKS PAST HIM LMAOOO
Bro I was dying when he was screaming for Freddy and he just runs past him was funny as hell
You see to look with Freddy's Roxy eyes or you can't get the good stuff
This game looks so rushed
I’m Monty golf you get his clause and in the race way is the secret ending
Ee YES *happy gremlin noises**
I think markiplier lost his brain cells, and yea from the last episode that I saw it said it was charging station is offline so basically you can’t not hide from the moon guy or whatever his name is Edit: lol Freddy ditched him XD
There’s a secret rooom where u can go to down and at the bottom is actually a pile of another fnaf there’s the old chica Bonnie foxy and Freddy in basically a ennard looking pile
MARK: fredddy!!!  Freddy: yeet i"m outta here  MARK: freddy you bastard 😆
No one: Moon drop: WHEEEEE
who’s gonna tell mark that you can stop the staff bots if you shoot them in the face
When you call Freddy... He goes where you summon him. At the spot you summoned him. You running, screaming like an idiot and having Freddy pass you instead of actually clicking it once at the stairs caused you to die. That was YOUR fault, dumb dumb.
There's multiple endings so keep playing :)
28:41 Freddy literally dipping on Mark made me cry laughing.
i feel like mark would like the mission after getting monty's claws
vanny
That running past Freddy bit was golden.
Poor Mark dealing with bugs, still a good video. 👍 happy holidays
Helloooo early bird here
Markiplier Screams for help to no avail from Freddy, while Chica uses Teleport easily to jumpscare him
want some milk mark? 🥛
Not being able to save during this "stay" part is such an incedibly bad design choice, geeeeezus.
FREDDDDYY WHERE ARE YOU GOING!!!!!!!
The part where the bots ripped freddy apart made me actually sad wtf
Has the King Of FNAF been bested by a patch ?
Mark: "FREDDY DON'T WAIT YOUR TURN!!" As Monty stalks him us the best part of the video by far lol
Mark yelling “FREDDY!!!” is now something I will remember and cherish for the rest of my life 🤣
Y'know. Weird as I find it that the Summon Freddy button is programemd as "come to the spot the button was pressed at" instead of "come to the player", it does result in some fucking hilarious shit like him just running straight passed Mark in this video. Multiple times.
Well yes but no Play all 3 princess quest and vanny ending
Ngl, I like Mark's videos but I still think he will still look great with red hair
YOU CAN SAVE! COLLECT THE ROBOT HEAD FROM THE RACEWAY!
i dont think i've laughed harder than when freddy ran right past mark when he needed him most
Red Hare-ing   Vanessa is a red head - Vanny is a hare 😂😂 Guys. I think Mark is on to something 😂😂
The theater is actually used in a different path that you did not do
Mark: “FREDDY I NEED HELP!!” Also Mark: Telling Freddy to meet him at 27 different locations🖤🖤🖤
Please also do inscryption
So who’s going to tell mark you can find a secret room where you were first get chase by monty                            That secret room being the room of Michael afton at the end of fnaf sister location                 And the true ending where you find out that the whole place was built on top of the og fnaf pizzeria and have to survive spring trap
The way Freddy ran past him LMAOOOO
I fockin hate Mr Moon.
there is a secret door behind a pirate foxy poster and you have to take pictures of the cardboard cut outs or the pirate characters and what is behind the door is so cool
did mark forget that when Vanessa was talking to Freddy about Gregory Vanessa said Gregory had no records like he wasn't a real kid I feel like that had something to do with the lore I may just be thinking to hard though.
9:25 AYOOOO vanessa be seducin a child that doesnt feel right 😳
There are four endings (the one you got): secret ending. True ending. Good ending. Bad ending
*OH MY GOD FREDDY!! FREDDY YOU BASTARD*
Watching this drunk is confusing
Mark: *Laughing in confusion of the ending*  Me: *casually crying*
Freddy!!!!
Marks Freddy voice is nice I know it's just him but deeper I still like it
The ending of this video had me fucking dieing
More like one night at Freddy’s Although I guess they never did really stick to 5 to be fair
Inscryption..?
I laughed hysterically everytime Freddy ran right past mark. 🏃‍♂️ 💨
Freddy runs to the spot you click the button lol I think it has always worked like that
20:14 Wait, that says December 23rd. Did Mark record and post this in one day??
i stayed up until 2am just for this lol
Mark are you ok? Every episode playing this broken game seems to be affecting your brain really badly
Dude when I heard Freddy's line in the ending. I was legit about to cry until Mark started fucking spluttering and I just fucking lost it, I feel so bad for laughing at the death of robo-dad but the way he was just so baffled was *G O L D*
I think mark there are other secrets hope you will try to find this secrets i only say Springtrap and 2nd i think this Game will Get DLCs
Perfect timing I was just finished with 6
Can wait for the animated version of mark calling for Freddy as he runs all over the place.
YOU CAN FIND AFTON MARK SECRET ENDING
omg y u click so bloddy much click once
“FREDDY!”
This game definitely came out way too early
markiplier i am listening to distractible are you proud of me
This game plays even worse than the Garry's Mod FNAF. 😂 What the hell happened to this game
Mark screaming at Freddy as he runs past him is the funniest thing ever
You gonna do all endings or just one ? o:
Me: sad at the ending Mark: making confused mark noises
Markiplier, without spoilers: You can get two endings that are better than the ones you got. The BEST ending: Go play Princess Quest 2, then do the Vanny choice again (either at the door or at the loading dock) then play it normally and play Princess Quest 3 in Vanny's room to get the ending. Canon ending: Do Monty to get his upgrade for Freddy, then go back to Roxy Raceway. In the raceway on your left when entering is a door leading down. You can open the gates when you have all of Freddy's upgrades. Once you do that take the elevator and enjoy
Hey Markiplier I just want to let you know there’s 6 different endings and you unlocked one.
Are you going to try all the endings mark ? And remember where you press call Freddy is where Freddy will run to.
I wish Mark knew that he has to do Queen's Quest in specific order from 1-3 if he can find the first one. Also to make things a little easier, he can actually stun the bots by shooting them in the face. Monty's the only one who can't be stunned due to his sunglasses and he is also considered the fastest enemy in the game, making him the most dangerous. Yeah, Monty's too OP.
Yes. Yes. You will find it! I have faith in you markimoo! The true ending is badass
yall realise the shadow at 17:30 looks kinda sus
its not a five nights at freddys series without mark losing his shit
no they didn't do anything to freddy he has been like that but you haven't noticed when you press the Butten for  him the come he will go exactly where you press the Butten not exactly  to you
Thanks for the birthday present Mark!
There are six different endings: 2 bad, 1 neutral, 2 good, and one canon ending
Mark: FREDDY IM ABOUT TO DIE Freddy: Trying to show up in all 1026 locations that mark wants him to be at
I hurt from laughing so much. 😭😭😭 28:41...😭😭
I remember what he said to freddy I love you before and now it's freddy you butthole.
I will always hope a company will make a place like this one, but without the you know killer animatronics.
Mark yelling for Freddy is the funniest thing 😂
I really hope Mark isn't really done with the game, he won't get to disassemble Monty and get the Canon Ending
2 hours late beat that
Hint 1: Find the other Princess Quest games. You found II in the DJ Arcade and III is in Vannys hideout. You just need to find III.   Hint 2: There's something going on far.... Far... Beneath the surface.
I'm convinced Mark purposefully fails the missions now. There's no other way to describe his masochism now.
28:43 IM LOSING MY MIND THE SCREAMING WHEN FREDDY RUNS PAST HIM LMFAO ABHAHAXHJSKAKZ
I swear, someone I watched had the staffbot activate from really far away and the staffbot told a really lame joke. I don't fully remember the joke but it wasn't an old school generic one, I think he made a poor joke about the workplace or like "what's the difference between searchbots and humans? the searchbots aren't lazy" or something like that.
I like how just forgot about the card last vid that said recharge stations don’t even work
I like how you just start narrating your suffering lol
*"You..Are my superstar.."* **Aggressive Sobbing**
It amazes me that Mark is even able to beat some of the games he plays lol. The fool can be the absolute worst listener in existence when it comes to games. I literally lost count how many times the game would explicitly tell him what to do just for him to later comment something like "Idk what to do because the game didnt tell me" in some combination of words. For example, it tells him the charging stations are unavailable during the last MoonDrop pursuit, but he ignores that and just thinks they patched the ability to get in without Freddy, Lol. Seriously stresses me out watching him play sometimes too because of it. Homie makes a living playing Video Games but I swear sometimes it seems like hes never played one before in his life XD. I say all this with love though. It adds to his charm honestly and the entertainment value. But sometimes I really wish I could reach through the screen and just shake some damn sense into him.
Maybefor another video just go for the “canon” ending, but unless you want to spend a long time trying to figure out what to do I’d look at a video or just ask like Dawko or fusion.
I think you beat yourself up too much about the mistakes you make playing, Mark. This is a really fucking difficult and often buggy game. A game that seems to encourage trial and error, and you’re asking yourself to get it without any mistakes.
That was fun and merry Christmas  Mark
I feel this game should have taken another year of development. the bugs should have been ironed out and a lot less content would have been cut. It would have benefited from an open beta so some features could be changed like more Vanny and some better bosses. The fact that it is easier to stumble upon glitches to beat the game than actually play it shows this. If y'all just weren't so impatient.
It would be challenging if Mark found the area thats the same with joy of creation last area that burning ??? Using the buttons to avoid entering the area and fready cannot use it in there
damn i really love this series i always wait for the next part seeing your reaction makes me laugh i hope you will notice me markplier
28:38🤣
These videos would had been better if 1. The game was polished and didn't have buggy nonsense 2. Mark was using 100% of his brain. He keeps missing instructions and overthinking things, either because he's doing commentary, he's annoyed at the game, or because he's mentally tired/stressed/frustrated/something  Still one of the best playthroughs because most of the people I watched were too much of a gamer. Full on gamer mindset. Barely getting scared 17:30 Mark is so pissed at this game he's barely reacting to this and is pissed even if that ending has some value  Edit: I see so many people on the comments blaming the game, and I mean the game does have a lot of flaws, but a significant part of why Mark's experience has been awful is his own fault as well. Like he even admits to his own faults
too bad fnaf will be coming to an end soon. or at least a decline in quality, because Scott is retiring. He deserves it, but it's sad to see a master quit his craft. it's clear to me that Scott either stopped working on this at some point, or was not the main person in charge of this game. of course I have not see the whole 100% of this game, but most of it was so depressing to see. kind of like tf2 not being cared for by it's creators, but the creator in this case just got burned out, plane sick of doing the same thing for so long.  as this series sinks down in popularity (the new installations), it will be forever remembered in the history of video games. (we will know for sure in time)
I wish they would make a dlc of mark being a security guard and you could help him survive the nights.
Mark creating the ultimate killer freddy :3@
Well now i cant click them. I want you to find me mark. I would love to meet you. Plus no job atm so no cash to buy merch sorry.
Freddy is a real homie in the new FNAF
You need to do all the Princess Aracdes to get the true 3 start ending.
Went to sleep. Now a new video😎 life hack 101
You should go to an earlier save slot and do all the extra stuff so you can still save.
mark slowly loses his sanity in every fnaf game
It does seem to have the old "Open World" problem. A very large environment yet not really much is used by the main story.
Guards: WHO MADE THIS MESS WHY IS CHICA, FREDDY, ROXY DAMAGED WHAT HAPPENED. Wait is that vanny?
If you think the Vanny ending is confusing, then just wait until you see the canon ending
Mark: to get the true ending. Me: Wait until he finds out that freedy getting dismantled was only 1 of 6 endings
I love how Freddy just casually runs past him like an anime girl late for school
Mark: "FREDDY YOU BITCH" Also Mark: *Runs to a different location*
Mark: FREDDY!!!! You ran past me!!!  Freddy: I'm trying to get to each location you summoned me to!
Mark please do an ep where you find all the secrets and collectables like the Vanessa dvd’s
Thanks for posting this now I lost all my games data 1.3 tbs gone
How fitting that Monty is the last one they face.
This game is so random 😂
28:40 It's been a loooong time since I felt like I was going to both A.) suffocate and B.) vomit from laughter.
Mark screaming Freddy shouldn’t b that funny😂
Markiplier needs to make these longer I know mark spends long editing and making it but more please
There is a buttload of content cut from the game. Like, 75% of the stuff in the trailers and files is just gone and doesn’t happen. They definitely bit off way more than they could chew and had to backpedal hard to get the game out on time
26:20 : Apparently, People forced the team to rush. So while then team had so much planned, they were forced to push out an unpolished game that they can now work to patch up to be a more reasonable and polished experience.
I wonder how Monty would have been broken, would be just beat him to death with a golf club xD
LMAO
Mark: "FREDDY"..."FREDDY"..."FREDDY"
The screaming of FREDDY  had me laughing so hard...but also is so nerve wrecking due to Monty and lack of ability to save lol.
That moment you realise time in security breach move like irl
There's 5 different ending Mark
Oh my gosh all that time spending collectables my goodness
Mark there is a glitch that let's you save after the choice. Go get the robot head again at Roxy raceway and you can save
Mark: **calling Freddy a hundred times**  Freddy: "WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU????"
Wow this game is like the definition of underwhelming. The plot makes no sense. It feels like we missed something integral to the story. Why do we even care about Vanny in the first place? All Gregory knows is that Freddy can't see Vanny, yet she's apparently the big bad? Wtf?
Give more {|}_{|} Videos
If you go through different doors there are different endings
Not sure if they fixed it yet but if you go to Roxy Raceway and reobtain the bot head you can regain the ability to save your game so you may want to try this... provided you don't get yourself lost again and yes this has been tested by a lot of people
that ending was hilarious
You may not read this Mark, but I think the key to why you're having issues with calling Freddy is this: When you press the button he isn't coming to YOU, he's going to the LAST PLACE you pushed the button, but you're no longer there because you keep moving after you push the button.  That's why at the end when you were going down the stairs he went right past you because you were no longer in the place you were when you pushed the button.  Hope this helps!
normal people would be sad when freddy died but mark is built different and just wheezed-
gay.
He really ran all the way up the stairs lol
When the scariest things in a game are the wet floor signs...
Mark is Charlie in the mail room
seriously i lost my shit seeing him running from monty
I died of laughter when mark was running from Monty and then he thought Freddy was coming to the rescue but ran right past him up the stairs! XD
These "unused areas that feel like they were going to have a use" might be for the next season becaise idk if you remember bit on that newspaper    it said "coming back next season" after freddy was beat up by the S.T.A.F.F Bots controled by vanny  Just a thought
GOD THIS INTRO HAD ME SOO GOOD XD Seriously, that was so unexpected, i loved it
freddy: *dies mark: *wheezing*
The way freddy  ran past you im dead
28:42 FREDDYYYYYYY
I love seeing mark have moments where he wants to call the Game flawed, but can’t cuz he knows people will hunt him down. Mark I see your faces of annoyance and I love and respect them
Who would have known that in Mark's most desperate times he would be calling for the one he had been running from all his life... Freddy
did he not realize for a while that moondrop appears at 5:55am?
Mark screaming at the top of his lungs for Freddy as Monty’s chasing him and he runs PAST Mark and he’s just screaming at him to come back is without question the funniest thing to ever be put on the internet
i was so caught off guard by the start of the vid, that I said sorry lmao
Pretty sure mark already knew this but "Vanny" isn't a robot, it's Vannessa inside the suit possibly being used by it or a split personality. You got 1 of 4 endings
11:50 Markiplier: Are u serious?  Siri: 'WhAt CaN i Do FoR yOu'
Ngl, Marks fnaf thumbnails always has an asthetic that seems eye catching and also mildly nostalgic. He makes good thumbnails that are unique than others.
if you can complete 2020 mode on every FNAF, you can beat this no problem.
Legend has it that Mark is still screaming "FREDDDDYYYY!!!" to this day...
Hey Mark Great video if you're finished with the game and locking for a new one there is a game about space and you control a astronaut through pace and do missions its 2d and physics-based its look beautiful and you should try it its challenging and I think you would injoy it
"Find the exit and you can leave" Fnaf fans: I DON'T BELIEVE THAT FOR ONE GOD DAMN SECOND
I love this Series l’ve been watching each episode minutes to hours after it comes out
What I guess happens with Freddy is he goes to the first location you summoned him from, so the AI had no idea what to do
"Good news! It's almost a *cock!* "
I almost peed myself with the freddy yelling 🤣
ALMOST A WHAt
its not mark’s fault, but the endings are so incredibly boring and disappointing. I wish they would’ve finished the game and waited instead of rushing to get the game released. I feel like we were left with a glitchy game to end the franchise. Or will there be other games by another creator? I heard those rumors that Scott has passed the torch.
The revenge of mashing Freddy
In situations where I don't how and why I died, I'd just google it and move on because I really hated the feeling but for some reason watching someone suffer the same is really entertaining.
I hate that people are blaming the way Mark is playing the game when really he wouldn't be having half these problems if the game wasn't so bugged. Of course, he's spamming the Freddy button, it's not working, and now saving isn't an option.
Game:  Tells you in everyway possible that you should go to an exit.  ANY exit. Mark: No.  I'm a masochist.
When Mark screams for Freddy, I feel like that's the same kind of screaming that should've been done for Jason in Heavy Rain.
There is more end than one, the true ending, bad, and  good
the game is so bad honestly
"NO!!! NOT OVER THEErrrEEE!"
Mark: picks vanny Also mark: confused noises
Mr. Markimoo you use the theater when you choose to do monty golf in stead of lazer blast.
Ok find me mark 😁
It’s really sad how many times editor mark has to pause the video and explain how dumb and frustrating things are😂
mark out here failing to realize you shouldn't spam the call freddy button, you're supposed to press and wait, which I guess makes him kinda balanced because you can't just say "haha now you can't find me at all" while being chased
Please Mark descover the other endings
Mark please go up to the red curtain that looks like Foxys curtain from FNAF 1 with the out of service sign in the kitchen while in Freddy because it's where Bonnie is and Freddy will say a really sad voice line.
Endings are ruined becouse they where low on money :/
"recharge stations are offline" also mark: why can't I enter
They should’ve pulled an OW2 and spent another year on the game
"FREDDY!!" Omg I was dying at that 😂😂
Freddy is so cute
AND WHEN YOU FIND ME, RUIN SHALL BE YOURS hAPPY hOLIDAYS.
Sometimes you scare me comrade Mark
if you hit the call freddy button once and loop back around to him your self you would not have any issues but you keep spamming the button and confusing his ai pathing..lol that problem exists in every single game with a call ai button option.
Please more FNAF. I'm begging you...
Freddy: dies Mark: Who can I bully and make fun of now!?
So glitchy
I kind of got pissed when Mark claimed to not understand the first ending that he got. I mean, come on Mark! How the hell did you not understand the first ending??? That's literally... like, one of the easiest endings in this game to understand.  Freddy and Gregory figured out where Vanny's hideout was (earlier on, obviously), they know she's the reason for all the missing kids in the mega pizzaplex (probably, because she's constantly wandering around being a psycho murderer), they confront her, she has control over a small army of animatronics (most likely because she is Vanessa, the head security guard) which she used against Freddy, Gregory sneaked into her room and turned the bots against her, she died a horrible death, Freddy in his last moments congratulated Gregory on his heroic deed, Gregory left the complex all alone after that incident, Vanny's death was used as a reason to shut down the mall.  Compared to the other more 'complicated' FNAF endings. This one and (FNAF 2's ending) are probably the easiest to understand. Mainly, because they're straightforward like horror movies' final confrontation scene as opposed to the cryptic shit Scott always pulls in some of his games' endings.  It's the game's MOST BASIC and GENERIC ending and somehow Mark is out here, scratching his head going... "Whaa???"  Rant Over
I wish he'd come and find me sheeeeeeesh
*FEDDY*
hi
If i ever decide to download this game, i will uninstall it the moment its finish downloading
Nice!
NOOO HE'S DEAD
The version you have is so bugged
Why was the comic actually so freaking sad omg
Mark: "FREDDY!!! FREDDDDDDYYYYYY!!!!!!!! FRRRREEEEEEDDDDYYYYYYY!!!!!" Worried Freddy running like an Olympic runner to catch up to Mark but still waits his turn when going down the stairs
It had nothing to do with the upgrades. You decided to kill Vanny.
can you do another episode of happy game i enjoyed watching it
Mark: "The game originally played differently." The game: Has multiple routes
yes multiple ending
Oh my god this game is such hot garbage
God this game flopped so hard LMAO
“Good News, It’s Almost A 🐓” Now that’s a Meme
I like to think about Mark’s neighbors every once in a while. Some nice older couple who sees this nice young man walking his dogs everyday, gives them a nice wave and while they wave back and smile they can’t help think about the countless nights they have heard shrieking about someone named Freddy. They do not know a Freddy. They don’t see someone else come or leave that house. They just know that this man does something with computers and is very very VERY angry at Freddy. They smile and wave and hope that his house doesn’t have a murder basement.
18:09 everyone is asking that about all endings
"I know that you, for some reason enjoy my suffering" and so do you Mark
The beginning 💀
ye
its 1 am and im drawing the cool sun guy in the daycare while watching this yay
Damn, it's such a shame this game is so janky. There are glimpses of a really high quality game, but thus far it kinda falls on it's ass hard... Maybe they'll fix it though, that'd be nice...
Legit just finished the last episode before I typed this only to be greeted with a new one talk about perfect timing
Mark and freddy recreating benny hill running around like that
Mark progressively screaming "FREDDYYYY" louder and more high pitch is a damn delight
Mark if u can find me then come, i just hope ur navigation is better than Freddy's
*Freddy runs past Mark on the stairs*  I'm helping!
Just a quick tip mark! Freddy will go to the last location you were when you called him, he won't come to you if you move
Ending 1: Disassembly There are still other endings and you potentially got one of two true endings. Good Luck and Have Fun :)
i know u are known for Five Knights At Freddie's and all but please don't forget about Inscription, i have been waiting for part 6 for 10 days now since all u have been uploading is the new FNAF game and i really am not as interested in that as i am in Inscription since that is a completely new game and all (in fact is is what has brought me back to your channel since most of your videos haven't been getting to me because of YouTubes stupid algorithm). i have really been enjoying Your inscription videos despite being frustrated at certain points because u weren't paying attention and then complained about the mistakes u were making because u hadn't been paying attention, please do part 6 of Inscription soon.
Freddy: *dying* Mark: this seems like a very good time to laugg
Am I the only one that wouldn't mind if Mark actually came to find them?? I think he would be a awesome guy to meet....even if it is for my doom.
hello
How?
so glad there is sooo much less monty and roxy hate on here rather than what i see on tiktok/instagram
I can now say I have watch your video in a bunker
Game: The recharging stations are disabled Mark: This hint can't stop me because I can't read.
I laughed so goddamn hard at Mark yelling for Freddy
Mark did you know, the mounting in Freddy feature scene is based off of titan fall 1 & 2 when you mount in you titan; true fact
When Freddy ran right passed Mark, I thought I was gonna pass out from laughter. Sorry Mark haha
No gonna click he links so that mark will find me :)
that vanny button really is just a pain button- ofc that's the button "not a masochist" Mark chose first
I love how mark gets chases by monty for 5 minutes straight
15:20 why'd they have to make her so damn thiccc?
You will come to find us like Freddy way? Like stuck in a random corner? LOL
FREEEEDDAAAAYYY!!!
Your gana play this game a lot because five nights at Freddy's security breach has a lot of ending bad ending good ending secret ending and more ending and the true
Mark: Did they run out of budget making this scene? Me: Well we all thought it, you just said it XDDD
27:48 is when the funny part happens 🤣
The true ending is playing princess quest 3
I was aitong for this the whole day then I see  at 8:26 ( hours ago
25:10 I was thinking the same thing. This game makes no sense
ending is worst part of game tbh.
1 of 4 endings. Get them all. One is the true ending but won’t spoil it for others
good news! it is almost a COCK
When Mark finds the old pizza place near the end. He might rage....
*FREEEDDDDDYYYYYY*
Vanny wasn't a red herring, she's the reason for children's disappearances. He stayed to get rid of her and that would mean no more children dying.
Freddy: "you are my superstar" Me: *sobbing* Mark: *wheeze laughing*
FINALLY YOU POSTED PART 7
This was amazing!  Keep doing what u do king!😁
the vids are getting shorter!
Mark: "Click on the links or I will come and find you. I WILL find you."  Hmm. I can't click the links now, since I really want Mark to come and find me, it would be a blast to hang out with him! Bring Chica with you please Mark! I want to boop her snoot! I'll put the kettle on, let me know when you're close, we can take our dogs on a lovely countryside walk or something, they'd get along great I'm sure.
Day 264 of asking for more phasmophobia
Freddy is such a menace in Mark's playthrough
WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A TRUE END AND YOU'RE INDIRECTLY CATERING TO THE IDEA THAT THE ALL 3 UPGRADES ENDING IS THE TRUE ONE AHHHHH
Jesus Christ, this game is held by spit and duct tape.
Listen Max headroom lol..😅🤣😂
imagine if they actually animated the first ending he got and it shows vanny getting ripped apart and it was just really realistic and bloody
FNAFSB is a lot like BOTW, you are only required to visit a few areas, but the option to backtrack and explore so awesome.
If anyone ever wanted to see Mark play Titanfall, well this is as close as you're gonna get.
I wonder if Mark will explore the other endings
10,931's lol
I am super confused...
7:31
i love how mark is so done with the game
FUCK I STUBBED MY TOE WHEN I SAW ROXY JUMP OUT!!
I can't help but laughed hard when Freddy ignores and walk past through Mark while he was asking for call after getting chase by Monty
Me: planned to do an all nighter the night before Christmas Eve Also me: didn’t watch three episodes of fnaf so I could have something to keep me up 💪
from what people say, there is a reward, but I think its a sort of disk she left you to collect at the stage??
This game is such a mess man
About the whole "the game originally played a lot differently than the way it does right now" part, Scott did mention when the game was first delayed that Steel Wool Studios wanted to make the game far larger than it was originally intended, which caused the delay. There is also strong evidence to suggest that the game underwent major revisions this last summer (ie., one of the devs confirmed that an unused mechanic found in the files relating to Vanny was purposefully cut during the summer, and Vanessa has a lot of unused voice lines in the game files that suggest she was originally intended to have a different, bigger role in the story). Overall, it seems like most of the development time went into creating the environment, and when it was done they realized that whatever story they had either wouldn't work anymore with this place, or that they didn't have enough time to make it without another delay, forcing them to hurry to rewrite and remake it. This would also explain why several scenes, voice lines, and even voiced characters from the trailers are not in the game (ex., Vanny had an interesting monologue in the first trailer, and Matthew Curtis, a voice actor from the second trailer, posted a video on Twitter about the release of the game seemingly unaware that none of his lines are in it). It's honestly quite fascinating if you look into it, but yes this final release is definitely not what was originally planned.  Also, I'm not sure if this has been patched yet, but you'll want to try getting another Staff Bot head from Roxy Raceway. It should trigger a bug to let you save even at 6AM. Trust me, you'll need it. Especially if you are going to go for the "true ending".
this game didn't come close to its expectations
Markiplier: *yelling for Freddy help*  Freddy: *runs right past him*
It annoys me how you almost never use the maps.
I never expected something meant to be scary to be so funny! 🤣 FREDDYYYYYYYYYYY!
Wow
the theatre isnt unused its just part of the missions you get if you choose monty golf
Who else watched Cory play this game instead of mark and come back to see him struggle
Crying at “you are my superstar”
mark: there's no way this is the ending.  also mark when he pick vanny: What am I doing again?
MARK THERE IS NO SPOILERS IN THIS COMMENT: I believe there is 6 endings if I am correct. The first one is you get by just leaving when you have your choice. The second you get by pushing the vanny button (the ending you got) The third ending is by escaping through the loading dock aria (idk how xD) The fourth ending is by getting all the golden plushy’s then escape through the fire exit The fifth known as the good ending is by playing princess quests 1 and 2 then pushing the vanny button then get to her room then play the last PQ The sixth known as the cannon ending is by hitting the button stay and getting all upgrades for Freddy then getting under Roxanne’s raceway and finding an elevator and going down it (I shall not say more except that it’s fire, it’s so cool and amazing).
😀
i'm almost crying for laugh 🤣💜 i can't with Markiplier calling freddy 'bastard' 🤣 i loved this so much
Should have known that spamming the Freddy button is a bad idea by now. Also hearing that the music is calming down but intentionally walking out of the hiding place, knowing perfectly well that Monty will see him..
Freddy: "you are my superstar" Markiplier: *Laughs*
Wouldn't the faser blaster stop monty?
This game looks so good but sooo, sooo... Sooooo... Unpolished or something...
29:14 this pain is cereal
He reminds me of haul the dad from malcom in the middle if he was edgey
Mark is really not enjoying his time with this, is he?
My favorite part is when mark starts screaming FREDDY and freddy just run past him like he doesn't care
Watching this really makes me not want to play Security Breach. It just looks like a pile of garbage.
Can you plz do the ending with the fire exit and click leave and wait till the end of the credits. Also love your vids, I rewatch all of them because you make me laugh every time
28:43  "FREDDY" "Oh wow look at the butterflies"
finished camping uploads
29:19 “FREDDY YOU BASTARD” Freddy’s AI is so broken
LOL I can't... hearing mark's Freddy screams starting to sound like a woman had me dying in laughter
Poor freddy the one good caring character
Yes you do get a secret ending by fully upgrading Freddy but there's also an ending you get for completing all 3 princess quest games and you need to play them in order
28:38 "FREDDY"
Who has seen him in that mental health commercial? ( I know it’s like a year old but has anyone seen it?)
"Freddy you bastard!"  *Markiplier shouted calmly*
can you not say som bad words or i am unsub
did you seriously just make that the outro?
lol that "Freddie you bitch!!" made me do a literal spit take. I hope you keep going with this until you get all the endings...
I was watching this on my phone and when he got killed by Moon on that stage I tossed my phone into the air for a second and caught it. It scared the HELL out of me because it came right the hell out of NOWHERE. I also did that in front of my brother and he asked me what's wrong and I told him I'm watching a guy play a horror game and it scared me.
FREDDYYYYYYYYYT
I really hope he hasn’t abandoned Inscryption because of this...
To get in my opinion the best ending but probably not canon. You have to stay past 6am go to the hidden door at Roxy raceway and go down the old elevator and see an old friend
i must say, i do not understand this game one bit. But still, the bugs make these videos absolutely hilarious!
"Nope they patched that!?"  Mark clearly missing that the recharge stations are offline
Lol early?
I like your pain
Mark- If you do not click on those links I WILL come find you.."  Me- "You saying if I dont click the links I get to meet Mark??"
In 2 hours u got 114k
I really hope you finish inscryption, I know act 2 is kinda weird but it really picks up again in act 3 and the ending is AMAZING.
omg
7:30 I think the game broke him!😂
When did the game every speak about disappearances
you can upgrade freddy's battery
How upsetting :(
I swear if I could ever bap mark with a pool noodle, screaming freddy as he kept running away from the spots LMAO
so, the security breach series was edited by Mark himself ?
I'm pretty sure when Freddy ran past you and Monty, he was following the trail of summon requests you spammed while running away. Just my theory on what happened there. He couldn't get to you very fast despite being right there, since he was running from spot to spot to follow your trail.
GOOD ENDING, BAD ENDING, SECRET ENDING, AFTON'S ANIMATRONICS ENDING !!! everything you do will lead to one of this endings beware of Afton....... He always come's back beware.......
I was laughing so hard when Mark trying to call freddy over and just ran past him only to get monty 😂 💀 🤣 😂 😭
Mark is really desperate to hide in Freddy while Freddy says *No.*
Yo mark you got the bad ending im not gonna tel you te good ending but this isnt the cannon endi g
When Freddy said "you are my superstar" I literally started crying
There are at least 4 endings. As for the seemingly "unused" areas/music tracks...Maybe Nightmare or ??/?? Mode at some point?
I can't wait untill they make a animation of the "FREDDYYYYY!!!!"
28:00 When freddy dont help you =))
tbh i have no idea what the update did ive noticed no change. Also theres a little trick to being able to save the game when deciding to stay. Go back to Roxy Raceway and pick up the driver assist head again and you'll be able to save again. (And no you wont have to do the objective)  But if you want the true ending of the game, rn i believe there's 7 endings? But for the true one without giving spoilers, make sure Freddy is fully upgraded, go to Roxy Raceway since you'' have to go back there anyway, look for the staff only door all the way to the left down the stairs. And have fun
Freddy: you are my superstar **dies** Markiplier: **laughing**
Everything bad that happened in the end there was ENTIRELY your fault Mark, not the game in the least. You are historically bad at stealth mechanics in a STEALTH game lol. If you would stop trying to brute force your way through this and try to actually HIDE from the staff bots then you could have easily lost Monty, and patiently waited for Freddies slow ass lol. This isnt DOOM, no need to rip and tear here lol, but speaking of which, ant plans to play the DOOM Eternal expansions? Please?
“You are my superstar.” 🥺🥺🥺
YOU CAN SAVE IF YOU COLLECT THE ROBOT HEAD FROM ROXYS RACEWAY. Like so mark can see.
i laughed so hard that Markiplier keep  calling Freddy when he's in danget
Anyone else’s Siri kicked in when he said are you serious😂11:41
Mark: "FREDDY!!!" Freddy: "WHERE?! WHERE THE FUCK?!"
At 26:34 it says “Let’s go to the lobby and get ourselves a treat.” I like to believe this is a reference to the Stupenduims Fallout 76 song.
Calling Freddy to you 15 different times in different locations probably didn’t help with routing Freddy to your location.
28:48 FREEEEEDY
Mark: calls Freddy  Monty comes  Mark: screams uncontrollably
Y'all what if vannys the same bunny from help wanted. And remember how vanny traps you at the end of help wanted, well what if Gregory's find out and finds him/you
These last few sections have just been so unnecessarily frustrating. Who in their right mind thought it was a good idea not to give you an autosave before important parts? I'm not even playing and I feel like putting the game down...
*Freddy gets destroyed by Vanny's weird controlled crew* Markiplier was too stunned to speak.
Also i game with multiple endings, pretty clever for scott
that intro felt like a fever dream for a second
Freddy fucked him over not once but TWICE! LOL
I love this part Freddy: *looks at mark while his head jiggles* Mark. *In a babyish voice* are you ready? Are you ready to go for a adventure with your jiggly head?  Freddy: Ye. Thank you for appreciating that I was once a little child who was killed by the man behind the slaughter
FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Who's cutting onions in here?!  [I cried when Freddy died]
I honestly gotta say that this game is a letdown…I expected more gameplay-wise and storytelling. Everything feels either unfinished, rushed or incoherent.
It's crazy how rushed this game looks. It has a ton of annoying or game breaking bugs, and the storyline + questline goes by so fast you have no time to process anything.  The game isn't bad nessecarily. There's still a fair amount of detail put into stuff, but i'm a bit disappointed  by the game so far tbh. I mean, it's not like the previous FNAF games had too much of a story or diverse gameplay either (unless you dive deep into the lore), but those were a different horror genre than this one. this game had so much potential to be a really good story horror game with tons of exciting content, but instead it looks like this.
Mark i love u for saying that this is not over. It just shows how much love u have twards ur fans and the franchise. Ur awsome man. Cuz i was scared when it ended and i thought u were gonna say ugh fine thats the end
Markiplier yelling for Freddy has made me wonder if he was supposed to protect you in the last chase.
FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mark, Freddy comes to the point where you called him to. He won't automatically follow you when you call him then keep going. Calling him when you're being chased is just impossible lol.
I’d like to know why the bonnie story line was completely cut from what i saw and also monty seemed really ignored in the game
Yes sirk
There's loading dock ending
27:56 couldn't stop laughing
I like how when Mark needs him most, FREDDDAAAAAAAYYYY just....runs away.
28:38 Best bit of the whole series!
Well...that "ending" was weird has hell XD Anyways keep up the amazing videos Mark
Game: "find a recharge station" Mark: "What am I supposed to do?" Game: "Find a recharge station" Mark: "WHat the fuck why did I die?"
Keep up the good work Mark!
There is no "true ending" There are some more endings. The choices you make and the way you play lead you to one of them
So what I’ve gathered is that the areas that you haven’t been to yet are the areas you’d have to go through if you choose to get Monty’s upgrade earlier in the game, i think.
28:36 Freddy really said not today
28:42 is the funniest shit ever😂😂😂
Not a good game honestly   its  story telling is all over the place
“FREDDDDYYYYYYY FREDDDDDDYYYYYY”
Oh.... oh, no....
currently sobbing
I was dying when he said "FREDDY"😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
@Markiplier Please go do the princess quest 1,2,3 for a ending
*good news! it is almost a c0cc*
I hope Mark just takes a month long break after this. The King needs his beauty sleep
Want to Save?  Go back to Roxy Raceway and pick up the robot head again. You can start saving again with it in your inventory.
"You could be a great guard."   Bruhh like we haven't guarded Freddy's for YEARS already
What about the stage?
forgive me for saying so but It seems to me that maybe something happened to the budget of this game 🤔 perhaps around January of last 😉perhaps now I'm not quite sure why that could be but perhaps it's something that might get a patch later here's hoping. Completely unrelated note I hear emojis are good for conveying sarcasm It's hard to blame someone for having their plans upended from the world ending
To save after you decide to stay, go to Roxy Raceway and pick up the robot head again, the time will go back to 5:00AM but you'll still have all the progress you had after you decided to stay, you'll even be able to go back to the exit and have the choice again.
23:35-23:40 LIXIAN!!! You swapped the stereo channels by accident.
marks mic audio is slightly off and i cant unsee it
aw cmon bro why did you have to kill freddy
i literally cried during this
My guess is the game was released incomplete so we'll probably see some patch updates for the game down the line to restore some things along with glitch and bug fixes. And then HOPEFULLY we'll see some cool DLC that'll explain some of the more plot heavy areas that are never explained.
mark hasnt used the sneak mechanic properly the entire game, he forgets the anamatronics can "hear" him so he just runs around and wonders why they can spot him.
why is his impression of glamrock freddy actually good
"FREDDY YOU BITCH"
Ok, so get Roxy's eyes first to find every single missing collectable

This game needed a little longer in the oven. It could've easily been the best game in the franchise, but as it stands, it might actually be the worst, imo. Either that, or FNAF 3, I still can't decide. All the others were brilliant. FNAF 1 was iconic, and revolutionised horror. FNAF 2 delivered on the high expectations from the first game, building on the gameplay in an ingenious way (the music box, the mask), for yet another stressful, and satisfying experience. FNAF 3 was alright, but the aesthetic didn't do it for me, there wasn't enough creative flair with the character designs and the gameplay was a huge downgrade from FNAF 2's extremely well balanced system.  Nonetheless it delivered on the horror front - and was still a somewhat chilling game. FNAF 4 completely switched up the series, and while the gameplay itself wasn't all that intricate, the atmosphere was brilliant, and delivered imo the best *horror* experience in the franchise, with horrifying character designs and a gameplay system that allowed freedom of movement but maintained, and even improved upon the horror. It also added a lot more in terms of lore, with the box and the minigames detailing the bite of 83/87/idek at this point lol. Sister Location was my favourite game in the franchise, for too many reasons to list. Long story short, it nailed pretty much everything that makes FNAF good, and added even more. Pizzeria Simulator was great too, and even though it was completely different, it was still highly enjoyable, even if it wasn't too scary. FNAF World deserves a mention here because of just how fun it was to play, which was not at all what I expected when I played it, being used to the horror side of the franchise. Ultimate Custom Night was exactly what it said on the tin, and nothing more, so I was satisfied. Help Wanted was really cool, and made the experience more terrifying through VR. And that brings me to this game. And honestly, I have no idea where to start, so I'll start with what I thought was good about it. The free-roam aspect of it changes things up completely which I like, and they pulled it off while maintaining an intense experience (at times). A few of the sequences were great, like the music man chase scene, and the endoskeletons in the basement. The visuals are stunning, the best FNAF has ever looked, even if it causes some lag. And that's pretty much it. Everything else was either highly buggy, good but underdeveloped, or just straight-up terrible (luckily not too much of that one). The bugs ruined the immersion that pretty much every other FNAF game provided, but were still kinda funny. Some bugs were quite frustrating though, and I'll bring up the one that caused Mark a lot of trouble - the call Freddy mechanic. If you watched this episode, you know exactly what I mean - Mark calls Freddy in his time of need, and even though Freddy is only a couple of metres (or yards, if you still use that odd system) away, he runs in the opposite direction. The consensus is that this is because each press of the Q key adds another destination to a queue of destinations for Freddy to reach, and he waits until he has reached the previous destination before moving on to the next. However some people have tried to make this Mark's fault, and I can't agree there at all - who wouldn't spam a button to call for help in an intense chase by an animatronic alligator? The game doesn't make it clear how this system works, so one would naturally assume that the devs went with the obvious choice - updating the destination for Freddy, not adding it to the back of the queue. This is clearly the most natural thing to do, so it honestly baffles me that the devs went with the choice that not only messes up the gameplay, but is also more memory-intensive.  Besides the bugs, most of the other issues are either with pacing, or the underdevelopment of certain areas of the game. For example, the "ending" in this video wasn't even remotely emotional for me, and nor was it emotional for Mark - the pacing was awful, and the rest of the game was too underdeveloped for any sort of ending to carry any weight. Most of the characters are pretty lifeless to the point where Map Bot is by far my favourite character because of the perfectly timed comedic relief. I'm not gonna end this comment on a bad note though, and I do wanna cut the devs some slack, I don't think they're bad at what they do by any means. This is just a clearly rushed game, anybody can see that. It looks like this is because Steel Wool were trying to get it out before Christmas. Also, this is just one ending, I'm aware that several others exist, and I hope that over the coming weeks, patches are released to get rid of bugs, and maybe improve the gameplay a bit. Hell, I wouldn't mind if they straight-up added a new section to the game, but I don't see anything like that happening. Until then, this game is a somewhat enjoyable entry to the franchise, but remains a disappointment when compared to the rest. I'll end this comment (more like essay lol) with a rating of all of the FNAF games, because why not: FNAF 1: 8/10 FNAF 2: 9/10 FNAF 3: 7/10 FNAF 4: 9/10 FNAF SL: 10/10 FNAF 6: 8/10 FNAF World: 10/10 (sorry I just loved it way too much) UCN: 8/10 FNAF Help Wanted: 8/10 Security Breach: 6/10? (as of 24/12/2021, might update eventually)
Mark not exploring the leave option left me sad
ok so something i wanna say it that in the other videos i noticed that the time was going down, like i remember seeing it turn to 3:30 at one point. i dont know if that cos something happened or it happens overtime. so maybe try and go but and speedrun what you did and maybe you will have more time to do the other stuff?
Markiplier's descend to insanity is the most I've seen for years
You should try getting the secret William Afton ending
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE
Why does it seem like Mark is getting progressively dumber with every episode he uploads, I can't tell if he's doing it on purpose for extra content for if he's genuinely losing braincells
“tHeY pAtChEd tHaT” 👏👏😂😂 no they didn’t.. one of the FIRST things Freddy said was “recharge stations are no disabled”
Mark playing this game in various ways and skipping parts is amazing
Such a story, punctuated with death. Now, we mourn.
That whole stairs sequence with Monty and Freddy gives me such strong Scooby Doo vibes, I love it.
Gotta say, that ending was pretty jank
I love the vids
Thank you for your suffering lol :D
Mark: FREDDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Me: *laughing to death*
The Vanny ending is giving GoT vibes
my theory is that the true ending is the only one with a cutscene and the others are just stories so thats why they are comics
You can play princess quest now that you chose the vanny store ending, also shoot freddy with your blaster, and try to go into the fazerblast area in freddy you get LORE mark LORE
The Game has 6 endings... Can you call yourself KING OF FIVE NIGHTS if you don't get them all?
"Freddy, you bitch! FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!" I'm done XD
I love ya Mark, but sometimes the amount that you just don’t pay attention is infuriating to witness
I love you kark
if you want a "good ending" then you must play Princess Quest 1, 2 and 3 before picking the "Vanny" option in the end, once you've played Princess Quest 3 (witch is in vanny's room) you will then unlock the good end
28:39 freddie like naw u on ya own greg lol...
1:41 if it was the end it would say (END) in title im sure :)
lets gooooooooo :)
Maybe they'll patch in a proper ending next.
Is anyone else just disappointed by the game? It felt so rushed and empty.
7:32 WHAT HAPPEND WHAT HEPPEND WHATHAPPENDWHATHAPPEND WHAT HAPPEND?!?1!1!1 WHATHAPPENDWHATHAPPEND WHATHAPPENDWHATHAPPEND WHATHAPPENDWHATHAPPEND
the best Christmas gift is a FNAF video
HELP WHY IS THERE SO MANY MARKIHATER BOTS💀
Mark @ 3:05 : "is it worth it?" My brain: "let me work it"  🤦🏽‍♀️
freddy: you have a choice, leave stay or vanny my brain:ah yes, live laugh lore
Shaking crying and throwing up, they didn't have to shred my man's Freddy like that. Disrespectful.
Ahh yes the empty theatre filled with staff bots at night, thanks for making me remember one of my fears lol
27:41
You always make me laugh Mark. You are my favorite #1 YouTuber. Have a nice day or night.❤
I wonder if Vanessa is a lost relative of William Afton. Because she was Instantly given the job as a "Night Guard" (Which you are in the other Fnaf games) with Nooo background or papers like a resume. And she dresses up as Vanny like how William was Purple Guy who went in the Springtrap suit
Wasn't expecting that intro
What they should do is put a timer on how much you can call freddy at one point in time. Seeing mark spam the call function got me thinking that it was that action that keeps breaking freddy A.I.
Wait is this series over?
Personally for me this game did not live up to my personal expectations I was expecting way more with way less I feel they poured too much attention and detail into the map and not really the story as much don’t get me wrong the map is amazing and yeah sure while it’s huge there is a lot of lack luster or dull moments moments that shouldn’t really exist in a Fnaf game I was really wishing for more from a triple A game company.
I still think that vanny has something to do with glitchtrap, because remember, Freddy can't see her
They should have fixed this up a bit before publishing
I laughed so hard when Freddy just ran past you on the stairs
my sister gave me headphones so I could watch this 💛
As much as the last part with Monty and Freddy was funny, I can't help but ask what Mark was thinking when he was doing that. Pressing the button brings Freddy to the location of where you pressed the button, so spamming it will only cause Freddy to continuously move in circles chasing you, which is why he passed Mark entirely at 28:40 . The map has many connected routes for a reason. Mark should have called Freddy once and then done a circle, giving Freddy time to get into position so Mark could jump in him when passing again. The Freddy-calling mechanic may be broken for all I know, but that part in particular was ENTIRELY Mark's fault (still hilarious though lmao)
This game is VERY buggy. To the point where a lot of encounters with Vanny just don't trigger. The main stage Vanessa tells you to go to? We don't even know if something's actually supposed to happen there.
Mark, you're on the right track.  Go to the exit and select "stay."  Go trigger Monty's boss battle in Monty Golf to collect his claws and give them to Freddy.  Then find the elevator among the rubble at Roxy Raceway (this is why you need all three parts, as you cannot access it without a fully upgraded Glamrock Freddy).  I won't spoil it for you, but this seems to be the true ending.
Finally he posted this episode
27:56 FREEDDDDYYYYYYYYY, lol i can't 😭😭
... he always comes back... He won't die... you know what you have to do... kill him... kill the alligator...
Marks there’s a Easter egg where u go into a joke and find Spring trap please do it
The super star hit different
I don’t know about anyone else but I’d watch more than what you post. You don’t have to spare us, we want to see everything that goes on pretty much
Any animation of anything Bloody or Gore could jus be taken out bc FNAF has stepped into the light and taken more influence and gained the attraction of the age group 12-17. Basically they chose this way bc it would be the easiest to explain what happened without crossing a line and getting too bloody. They showed Freddy attacked before, yes ik Mark didnt have the upgrades and thats why Freddy didnt fight, to show how the comic portion shouldve went down. In a way its like meant for use our imaginations, leave it to us to imagine how bad it was
Im not gonna lie... I also laughed when freddy died that was so dumb. Also, I still cannot tell if the noise that happens when he encounters the wet floor signs is added or not. I'm pretty sure it is but I mean I wouldn't be surprised if it wasnt
I seriously hope Mark decides to do more, I'd like to see more endings because the one he got was kinda.... lackluster after all Mark went through... After all that I think Mark deserves a MUCH better ending than what he was given.  Like if you all agree.
mark"freddy oh not not like this  freddy"uh what you say
FREDDYYY!!!!!
Betcha ten bucks that the old elevator shaft that was mentioned during Roxy raceway is the elevator shaft leading to sister location. I'm thinking that the megaplex was built were the house used to be.
is it me or is this game not that "fnaf" ?
There is a door when you go down the Stage  elevator there is a gate where you need all three upgrades go there also in another episode find and play all the princess quest (you have to play them in order)
I wonder if he'll complete all endings
15:30 i don't know what it is but that feel really fuck up
15:01 FREDDY! THATS A CHILD
I think what Mark hasn't really caught onto is that each time you hit the summon Freddy button, you add a request in a queue of locations that Freddy will navigate to... so the more you frantically push the button, the more places Freddy adds onto his list to get to, which is why he bowled right past Mark to get to a spot to which he'd summoned Freddy earlier. If you want to actually get Freddy, you need to avoid running all over the place and/or hit the summon button less often. ...That said, when you're in the middle of being chased that's not really an option. I propose a new patch: ditch the summon queue. Each time you hit the summon button, it should overwrite your previous summon so that if you keep pressing, Freddy will eventually reach you, instead of running to keep up with all the places you've summoned him from.
I have a funny feeling this game was a little rushed
11098th comment
Why do I get the feeling that this is going to be "getting over it" all over again?
Mark, there's another ending to the Vanny choice that you ran past  And Freddy's not broken, he always runs to the spot you summoned him to, regardless of where you move after that XD
I dont want Markiplier to go through the problem of doing the endings, because they're hell to complete.
Is it just me or do anyone else see eyeballs on slip n fall caution signs in real life now because of this game?? And dont they remind u of wall-E
This isn’t a spoiler but one has to do with princess starlight and another has to do with the hole in Roxy raceway. Love this series
Me knowing that I'll be able to meet Markiplier if I don't click the links in the description.
Freddy really was like "you make fun of my death I'll make fun of yours"
From watching marks play through thus far. They really just made what seems to be a mess of things. Curious if it would of been better if Scott was still around.
This game needed like, 6 more months of development lmao. It’s embarrassingly unfinished.
There's a secret ending in the back left of Roxy raceway but you need Monty's claws first just so you know.
*FREDDY! FREDDY! FREDDDDYYYY!!!!*
I'm going to make this comment become history
Top 10 betrayals
I don't like how Vanessa says "Go check the main stage". It's so creepy!
Vanny kinda bad tho
u mad? LOL xs
I shall give a caution like hint about one of the endings in a poem.      Fun like the sun☀️ Merry like the moon🌙 They will still catch you⚡ even if its too soon. 🕕
28:42 HAHAHAHAHAH
First person to reply is gao
For thoses who want to know, The game was pushed to be released by fans (even with all the delays) which is why it's so buggy
stay  leave VANNY 😈😈
for the canon ending you have to get all upgrades for freddy then go go to roxy raceway go to your left when you open the gates take the elevator and youll see
29:15 Mark: Freedy Your Bastard   That made me laugh
Fun fact. It is in comic book form because Scott quit. Same with the unused areas
Mark: about to fucking die   Freddy: 🧍
Mark has such a love-hate relationship with Freddy
VANNESA IS NOT VANNY!
mark  for the crazy lore ending get all the parts and find a certain door in roxy raceway. i don't now specifically where it is. but theres a door thats a little tucked away. thats all i will say.
5:34 Mark: Freddy! Me: Oh great, you lost Freddy. 7:32 Mark: What happened? Me: The MoonMan! He got you! 9:45 Mark: We're going back to the main stage. Me: WHAT?! It's a trap! 9:50 Mark: I just want to know what is going on? Me: It's easy Mark, you're gonna fall into a trap! 10:18 Mark: Vanessa, are you serious right now? Me: I told you! 10:46 Mark: *Got scared* Me: I told you it was a trap! 11:23 Me: What'd you say?! I can't hear you with your shouting! 11:46 Mark: Are you serious? *Repeating* Me: Will you stop saying that? 12:24 Me: Mark, we'd talked about this. Stop getting caught. 15:46 Mark: *Confused* What? Me: Just RUN! 16:57 Mark: Where am I? Why am I here? Me: Never mind that just keep running! 19:39 Mark: Shush. Me: Don't you shush me. 29:14 Mark: OMG Freddy! Me: It's not Freddy's fault that he couldn't keep up. 30:05 Mark: I'm done. Me: You won't be done for long.
28:42 Mark got karma for laughing at Freddy’s death lol
The real game has begun
"It is almost a cock?" Markiplier makes a YTP when?
"I don't know what this is about finding an exit and getting out of here..." This reminds me of an episode of TBBT. There's a scene where Sheldon says a "normal person" sentence, not even scientific or nerdy or anything, but Penny still looks at him and goes "Whuh?" like he was speaking in Calculus. I'm guess Mark just didn't read the dialogue box because I don't see why he can't understand it. He may act goofy but the man isn't stupid.
Mark there are more endings. Including a secret ending please show us those I want to see your reaction. Also for the ending you got, Gregory disassembled Vanny but because Vanny isn’t a robot it’s basically human flesh getting torn off. Hope that clears up that ending.
10:45 literally freaked the fuck out and dropped my phone
28:40  Mark: FREDDY SAVE ME, GET ME IN!!!  Freddy: Oooo, its 6 o'clock! Time for my morning jog!  *My man's gotta keep his workout routine goin'*
this is disappointing and sad I know mark is trying to save it, but it feels so unfinished, lazy and not at all a fnf experience this looked so promising and i liked the concept and the art stile, but it feels unfinished and empty. seems to be the trend in games now
Ok pls come find me
me, a vanessa: i wonder how all the gregorys and freddys feel rn..... cause i am A Little Stressed lol
In Vinny’s room, there is Princess Quest 3. If you play and complete it, you will get the true ending.
when u call freddy he comes to the location of where he was called, not to where u are. so if u call him and then move away he will run to where u were before
This game… It needed some more time to be finished up >.>
We gotta do the true ending
Not allowing players to save ( and no autosave feature) for a what seems to be the last large chunk of the game feels like a huge design flaw
“You are my superstar” Sobbing uncontrollably Mark: wheezing
That was amazing 😂
mark yelling for freddy while he’s just casually running downstairs next to monty😭😭
ITS BEEN 2 HOURS. HOW THE FUCK ARE Y9U ALL HEAR ALREADY!?!?
Mark in the display lobby screaming "FREDDY" A kid in a Grocery store yelling "MOM"  Same energy
28:42 has to be the funniest part of this video
Can we give Gregory a medal for doing this I one night
Princess Quest 1, 2, & 3 in order
Scott Cawthon really outdid himself with his final FNAF game. The open world setting mixed with the open mission cycle really helps in creating a more uniform game. I am going to miss his games even though I never really played any of them.
You should check out music man now that you successfully rebooted his sector. There's something a little neat there. In the same breath there's a lot of alternate endings, quite a few can be found using different exits around the facility. You'll like a them.
TRUE ENDING (ft. William Afton) -I hope to see you, Sir Mark, beat its true ending soon.
Ok, the scene where they disassemble Freddy is kinda hilarious
Mark, without spoilers:   The BEST ending: Go play Princess Quest 2, then do the Vanny choice again (either at the door or at the loading dock) then play it normally and play Princess Quest 3 in Vanny's room to get the ending.  Canon ending: Do the Monty route to get his upgrade for Freddy, then go back to Roxy Raceway. In the raceway on your left when entering is a door leading down. You can open the gates when you have all of Freddy's upgrades. Once you do that take the elevator and enjoy :)  And yes I copy this comment from Cory's video.
GAME TIP TO MARK AND OTHER PLAYERS : if you go into the main atrium, and head towards the monty golf display. The door next to that leads to rockstar row ( the rooms of all the anamatronics ) and it makes the travel so much easier! :)
i like how he screams at freddy to come to him but he keeps calling him and resetting his pathfinding
HAHAHA RED (EYED) HARE-ING  HAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHHAHA
Love you
Freddy: coming to help  Freddy: seeing Monty,fuck this shit am out
“There are links in the description I know you haven’t clicked on”  Yes I end the videos as soon as you start mentioning them thanks for noticing
Markiplier  I don't know if you have found it but  The there is a big  hole the ground  And if you go down there It is a layout of a 5 nights at Freddy's game
Hete we are at again at mark all of a sudden explaining the fnaf lore
Wait wait wait. I heard the scream sound spring trap made when mark implies was running around. It was just for a second, about 23:35 or so. Am I crazy? It’s the pixels, distorted, lowered scream spring trap makes. Does it happen anywhere else? Why is it there? Pls someone just confirm that I’m not absolutely crazy.
It really is like they ran out of funds or something for the rest of this
I’ve been watching the security breach series all morning and once I reached the 6th episode I noticed there was another episode (7) that was posted 2 hours ago so I feel so lucky.
I love the monologue Mark throughout these whole series.
Man, this game is accually trash...
mark's reaction to Freddy dying was priceless, it's so honest lol
There is a secret and canon ending with monte
Guys tell mark how to get the good ending no spoilers on whats to come from it
Find Princess quest games
That can’t be it for ya Mark. Surely the King of FNAF can find the TRUE ending, right? 👀
why screaming "Freddy" 28 times didnt  work?
23:36 and 23:20 you can hear the golden freddy sounds or some sort of sound from fnaf 2 and 3 when you're about to enter a minigame about the anamatronics, where you have to save them. Could be some hidden message or lore. Very interesting.
Huh...is the "YouTuber is Garbage I'm better" A new clickbait to get people to click on profiles and maybe fall for scams? I'd probably just report those accounts if you see them.
haha old fnaf king yells freddy while pedophile runs after him
Could you do the canon ending? Please Mark?
There's a ton of endings and secrets, the LORE gonna be insane.
birthday video thanks mark <3
Mark after u get all 3 upgrades, head 2 a sercert area in roxys raceway all the way 2 the left dat will lead a path 2 the true ending.
28:41 Top 10 anime betrayals
The game did keep getting delayed. If they’d delayed further and given themselves all the time they could need would we have been more satisfied with the final product? Probably
Guess he shouldn't have left at Freddy's low budget death.
i wish u mark a merry christmas and every one who subscribed and liked and has the bell on ;)
i think theyre trying to following final fantasy 15 where alot of the story doesnt make sense until the dlc comes out and it fills in the plot holes that the main story left.  for instance bonnie and foxy are mentioned and there is a banned foxy area as well as the level 10 doors have nothing behind them so its reasonable to believe that fills in all the holes and utilizes everything.
mark was screaming for freddy so loud that water formed in his throat
7 videos in and Mark hasn't figured out that Freddy runs to the spot you summoned him from. So if you move before he arrives, of course it's gonna look like he's passing you by. LOL
Bruh I legit cried when freddy died
mark sounds like freddy     mark was freddy all along and is part of the fnaf lore confirmed.
The first part of this was a bit painful to watch lol. Especially since an exit was so so sooooooooo close.
If you grab the robot head at roxys raceway it will allow you to save. It makes the time 5:15 am but it is still technically 6:00 am
There is also a secret room in the game that reference sister location
I'm sorry Mark, the story in Security Breach is actually as disappointing as you think it is.  All the secrets and true endings and whatnot sure do help it but they don't fix the overarching problems with the story.  For example, Gregory mentions disappearances in this video... something that just wasn't addressed for the entire rest of the game except slightly mentioned in 1 of the other endings. This confirms Gregory is there to investigate disappearances which... doesn't line up with the rest of the game? If that's why Gregory is there, why is his sole focus the whole time getting out until the very end?  Also, I think your theory about the game being heavily changed through development is true. There is A LOT to support this theory. It's been talked about on reddit a bit from what I've seen. Something that caught my attention is Vanessa's portrayal has completely changed from before release to the actual game. I don't remember all the details but I definitely remember seeing people talk about it.   SPOILERS ABOUT VANNY BELOW: Yeah Vanessa isn't the main villain, she isn't Vanny. You know who is? Some unnamed person who looks the same as Vanessa and has some connection to Vanessa. That's just what we got.
Freddy runs to the location you were at when you summoned him, not to you directly. You running around spamming it like a mad man just means youre constantly leaving the spot Freddy is running to lol
idk if its on purpose or not but Mark has been running into every possible Security bot since Part 1 of this series. Some i can understand.. but others are like... god damn come on bro
It would be cool if mark made a video dedicated to getting the real true ending of this game, won’t spoilt but purple guy is involved in it
17:49 i hurd of good endings, bad endings, cliffhangers, but never no cheap budget endings lol cheap endings is a new new for me...
bdjdjsjd why did my mind go straight to the comic book ending being bcus of Scott leaving 😭💀
God this game is such a mess. The creators definitely bit off more than they could chew
Damn I love this series
Mark, if you pick up the broken head again from Roxy Raceway the save station will work again without resetting your previous progress, this game has multiple endings
28:49 turn on the captions 😭✌️
i love how mark spams the button, not realizing that it calls freddy to that location, not to him specifically… i also thought that maybe if u press it more than once it cancels it?? tho i might be wrong w that
Theres a playable arcade cabinet in roxys raceway main entrance bit   like this to let markiplier know
Well if you finding us is as good as freddy finding you then we have nothing to worry about
not me crying over freddy’s death
14:04 I am afraid too Freddy
Shapadooooshapoo
I want someone to hack into the game and let you save after you pick the stay option
26:45 bECAUSE THSI IS A REFRENCE   lets all go to the lobby, lets all go to the lobby, lets all go to the lobby to get ourselfs a treat
i got the among us vent ending
Anyone else feel that even if we collect every collectable, it still feels like an unfairly short game for what its worth?
Bruh his intro XD 😂🤣
freddy oml LMAO
the music sounds like the omega mart music
My freddy just runs marathons now without me even calling him
The fact that Vanessa says come to the main stage and NOTHING HAPPENS when you go to the main stage is so frustrating.
I don’t think I like how seductively Vanessa just spoke to Gregory 😂
Something tells me this game was not finished
Hey mark if you go back to the roxy raceway and pick up the broken drivers head again you can save
Mark could play this game for another 12 hours and still not figure out that spamming the call button doesn't work. Freddy goes to the location where you first called him
Mark: calls Freddy.  Freddy: I will talk to you later and let you die.
in the theater behind the foxy poster is a secret door to the sundrop room (in the daycare) with a cool collectable and some secrets.
Why is it only 30 mins?? I NEED MOREEE!!
Markiplier! In your first video of Security Breach, you went to an area that required a level 3 security pass, it had the animatronic face cutout. It was near the entrance or near Freddy’s room.
Mark: I will find you.  Me: Thank you~ I'm lost!
Very glad mark is going for the true ending and I’m hyped to see his reaction to it, if you know you know
here’s how you get the true ending: disassemble monty and upgrade freddy, after that, go to roxy raceway, when you go thru the entrance to the raceway on the left there’s a door going down, use freddy’s upgrades to open the gates, after that go down the elevator and enjoy the rest
Recollect the driver head in foxy race way
that ending was kinda hilarious
The funny thing is Mark's upload schedule is so easy to stick with when you're the viewer.
Also if you pick Vanny and do the Princess Quest 3 mini game you’ll get the true ending
I like how mark quickly figured out that wasnt the only ending
There are actually 6 endings I believe, including the True Ending.  You now got 1 of those endings. So I guess you still have some stuff to do. But let me just say one thing....  There is something slumbering there at the Pizzaplex. An secret buried deep down...
You better had posted because I was watching someone else's gameplay. They were good, but I like commentary.
I reckon the whole purpose the final cutscene is a cartoon was for graphic purposes because disassembling a human (vanny) wouldn't exactly go well assuming vanny is a someone wearing a bunny suit but ig thats just my opinion regardless it being obvious
I'm honestly fascinated by how janky this game is. I really want to know what kind of train wreck happened during development, because there's no way a game is released in this state without a reason.
reading these comments spoiled it i regret coming in here omg
i think this location is sister location. sister location was taken place in the basement so im assuming this place is above it. thats why on the main stage, you go down into the parts and service, which in sister location, you go down a circle elevator, similar to the elevator for parts and service. depending in sister location whether you listen to baby or not, if you go left for a couple steps like baby tells you, you end up in the scooping room, which is similar to the protective barrier and how it dismantles freddy for better parts and whatnot. if you disobey baby and go right, you end up to the hidden area, which the parts and service area does have a couple rooms that possibly can be one as they are lift doors, similar to how you keep ennard? out so
this game is a broken mess
Mark turns more into matpat every game
It was the end of a different video so I went to the bathroom and heard the elevator music and got excited
Guys like this so mark can see: Markiplier go to the area where foxy’s cove is (in the big kitchen i think) while in Freddy. He’ll say something about it
Does anyone know the name of his outro, I really wanna listen to it
But what happens when u leaveeeee
Okay so this game is definitely not the best of it I get that.  I do like this game though  HOWEVER here are my takes on some of the major issue things.  First off the style. This game is nothing like any of the other fnaf games, now wemve been able to move around before in fnaf 5 and 4, but this is very OPEN and I think the reason there are so many glitches is because their not use to making this kind of game at least to this capacity. Its extremely open world and massive and the collectables are in small areas. Not to mention them having to design/animate the characters INTO the area. I don’t think they were really prepared for anything and it was a little under developed in total.  Now the character glitches. This game glitches a lot, as we’ve seen. But I honestly don’t mind it. Now with things like where roxy wasn’t charging or moondrop getting stuck in certain places in the daycare, it can definitely be really annoying and also lessen the fear factor of it all, however it does give the game some character that I think is really funny. The glitches do make this game really funny and entertaining(and also really annoying) they do definitely need to fix them however, at least the ones in the MAIN story line(like Roxy not charging)  The endings. I have not SEEN all the endings because I’ve only watched marks playthrough and am broke af and cannot buy the game myself. But there are 6 and I know some of the endings. The one that was in THIS video however, was straight garbage. And I think a lot of people agree. It made almost no sense with how it came about, going from a cutscene(that made no sense) to small level of gameplay/chase scene and then to a comic with artstyle we have not seen in fnaf before. It was chaotic and I get it was supposed to be heartrenching (which I was still upset when freddy said “You’re my superstar”) but it really did NOT give us the heartrenching feel.  The storylines of all of this, as mark said, don’t exactly add up. He never really got around to fully finishing what he was trying to say I think, but I think he was thinking what a lot of us are thinking.  There are parts of the game that were underdeveloped and the entire storyline/plot was so chaotic that it was confusing for most of the game of what you were supposed to do. Now I know there are 6 endings so you’re supposed to be able to get some things AFTER you click your choice, however before those choices come around what you’re supposed ti be doing it super.. confusing. It basically throws multiple things at you at once, the collectibles distract more then help, the glitches confuse and annoy most of the time, and the layout is so massive its hard to remember all the areas and where you’re supposed to go and what to do and all that. And freddy glitches out when he’s telling you what to do/the subtitles don’t even appear so it makes it 10x harder.  This game is jot complete shit, its funny, the design is really prettu, and I can tell they had a storyline.   But the execution was horrendous and they really needed to add more time to this, definitely have more testing, and all in all maybe even make it a bit smaller of an area or even not design ALL the tiny insignificant rooms so much so they coulda done OTHER things way better.   Do I hate this game? No. I love fnaf and this game is really interesting and I do love how they tried to branch off and do something brand new which fnaf did need, but in terms of the storyline from fnaf 1, I don’t see how it all connects and the game isn’t fully complete.  Maybe they’ll have more updates next year and a lot of things will be fixed, and if mark gets all the endings(like i’m sure he’s gonna do cause hes the KING OF FNAF) then I will have more opinions later on. But this is just my take on the thing for now. :)) thanks for reading this if ya did XD
BTW Mark, the fizzy faz upgrades your stamina.
I'll be entirely honest. I was loving this game, but the "ending" feels REALLY anticlimactic. IK that there is a "real ending" but i wish we could have gotten more playablity/cutscenes for the various ends. Obviously, FNAF fans will go deep dive for the true ending but, for those just getting into the franchise I think better endings would have been nice
Why would you not choose the "Leave" option? It's obviously another end to the game and will let you go back to the same autosave!
This the last episode?
I’m sorry they need to fix this game and make that Vanny sequence more comprehensible
When i started waching this it was made 33 min ago
crying yesterday I saw Mark's dms and I was shocked you can see them in my *"About me"* section Hey mark, if you can see this, there’s a second ending to the “vanny” option. Just look around the security office for other interactables
FREDDY!!!!!!
28:43  This part has me in tears 😂
"Did they run out of budget for the ending" 🤣💀☠️
you know that you can use chica's voice box to stun other animatronics.
The ending was skressing me tf out😭
Mark: FREDDY!!!!!! Freddy: I pretend I'm not hearing that *proceed to walk away*
Calling Freddy repeatedly while running in circles making him follow In circles. Shoulda used a hiding spot the moment Monty was summoned.
I’m not a FNAF fan but this game plus marks commentary and game play might turn me..  Is it time for a binge watch?
I think everytime Mark calls Freddy it creates a path where Freddy MUST go before he goes anywhere else. So my guess is that when Mark is spamming the call Freddy button, Freddy needs to go to every point where Mark was when he called him. Or his path is just broken lol
The screaming for Freddy at the end was so f ing funny I’m crying so hard 😂
considering how cool and expansive the map was, I really wish this game had just waited an extra year or gotten some extra funding. In it's current state it feels like a salvage project, which kind of sucks when you step back to consider how innovative it was or could've been.
Mark nailed the Freddy voice that time.
mark should try the princess quest 3 ending
The way Mark screams for Freddy reminds me of a child lost in the store crying for his mommy.
see, i think this game is very fun and looks interesting and so beautiful. i like the plot, i like the characters, i like the overall vibe. but it's just so buggy and not polished it genuinely feels like a mobile game 😭
Imagine being a robber deciding "lets rob this place!" And then seeing all this
just finished watching the 6th part your vids are great keep it up
I'm not gonna say a lot but the princess quests arcade games are VERY important mark! also, the theatre is used just not in the way you think!
Vanny is waifu
"You enjoy my suffering"   Yes, yes I do.
Imagine if child just don't want to go home and want to play, and for fun push Chika into trash compactor, rip eyeballs from Roxy, making her suffer from it and finally order to rip apart security guard in bonnie costume, because she treaten to call his parents.
Something tells me mark doesn’t know how the “call Freddy” function works.  Granted, I don’t ether. I believe he goes to the spot where you called him.
bro i thought the comments were spoiling the ending by saying freddy betrayed him and i was so upset i came down here 😭
Mark; FREDDY!!!!! Freddy;GIVE ME A SECOND...!!! (Ran just by him) 😂😂😂😅😅😅👍👍👍
Okay honestly I REALLY wanna see Mark get the true/afton ending, I'm curious as to what his reaction would be
He got the sad good ending huh
I just wanna see mark cry on freddys death in the vanny ending
Can you play yandere simulator again, please…… I am going to keep asking until I get a response
Mark should try leaving to get the bad ending out of the way and then try progressing towards Roxy’s raceway to get the robot head so his time can go back to 5:15 AM therefore he can still save the game
i dont know what to comment but if u see this im still watching the intro
Mark: screaming about freddy not coming. Also mark: spam calls freddy for 1000 times
Oh so this is like overtime in deadrising
You are doing an incredible job at getting these videos out quickly, keep up the good work!
hey mark. after you get kicked out you should try entering again
9:25 I’m too fucking down bad for this shit
ANOTHER
Let's be honest, Markiplier seems a little bit upset(that's exaggerated, but is the only word i found that would combine with that) with the game, he probably expected different stuff going on
There's another ending that I wonder how it happenef
When it said it was 5:55 it was 5:55 my time
There is a glitch where Monty starts flying lol
yayyyyy
18:09 Thats what I said...
28:45 never trust anybody.
I feel bad for this game, it has almost everything it needs to feel complete and it definitely is finished, it’s just put together so openly it leaves the whole thing feeling all over the place. With sister location the location was massive but they sectioned it off to make the feeling of coming back to something different each night feel episodic and freshen up the experience. This one has some amazing detail and a map that blows my mind with how big it is, but the openness makes it overwhelming and the story chaotic. If the wandering around to all the locations came after the game as like a bonus for finishing the game, it’d make more sense having seen it all before and knowing what to do and where to go. This is a fnaf game if which the likes I never imagined and watching Mark, the superstar, play it makes it enjoyable either way.
OMG YAAAAAAAAAAY
Here’s to hoping for a save after 6:00 AM mod, for your sanity.
7:44 lol
wow this game is not great omg
goddamn this game was weird  this is like the 'metroid: other m' of FNAF im calling it now
If you go back to the speedway and pick up the severed head again it makes it so you can save again
Mark running around and spamming the call freddy button is driving me nuts!! I bet you the most effective method is to stand still and press it once and wait for him to get to you. Every time you move or press the call button freddy probably has to work out a new path 😅
I cried when he chose Vanny because that’s the ending where Freddy dies Mark what have you done
you always have the best videos and thumbnails #1 goat
The reason Freddy didn't come right to you is because he went to the last place you call him, he hits every point you called him at before fully reaching your current point
Keep on beating that money cow mark. Looks like it’s dropping another golden nugget. Just keep. On. Beating.
Why is everything so dark?
The theater actually does have a purpose, I just don't think you did the quest that used it. That's my guess on a lot of areas in the game, there are probably specific ways to use them that I didn't find.
Mark if you want the true good ending you have to get monty’s claws and go to roxy raceway. The rest is up to you to discover how to get monty’s claws and find the place in roxy raceway.
Honestly this whole game has been so badly written and guided, glad I'm not playing it myself 🤣
If ya didn't know, Scott left the team in the middle of development of this game
The most annoying thing was listening to mark scream at Freddy after he mass spammed summoned him and then kept summoning him as he ran around and got his AI broken it would have been fine had he just left him up at the top of the stairs instead of trying to panic spam XD
One last part for all the endings Mark… It’s what we DESERVE
So inscryption gone? Lol.
Mark: "FREDDY I NEED HELP!!" Also Mark: Telling Freddy to meet him at 27 different locations
At 22:34 you can see circus baby plushy
Toobad it was released before it was finished.. I swear half the shit in the trailers and teasers aren't even in the game.
So about part 8?    Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach - Part 8: There is no Part 8
No it’s because you didn’t do the ******** ***** game, if you do that then you find out that vanny is ******** and you sit in there sun, also getting all the upgrades you get the killing ***** ending
28:41 STOP IM CRYING
i am so glad that mark is smart and is going for the good ending
"if you don't click the links in the descriptions I will come find you." So im expecting you over soon? Ill make you dinner. lol
I didnt knew mark´s voice could get so high pitched xD
"FREEEEEDDY!!!!" HAHAHAHA xD
"In no way is that the real ending" yes you just got the BAD ENDING
Not me Screaming internally for him to go back to the main stage because of the mission he literally saw. XD  Edit: Also me screaming because he got Freddy killed. XD. (I know it's an ending but still. lol)  Note to Mark (if you ever get to reading this): I challenge you to find all the endings! good luck.
Don’t upload so fast I am at part 3!
This game has been literally set up for dlc. Which I'm excited about ps seeing Mark scream Freddie high pitched had me on the floor
I would love for someone to make an animation of mark just screaming freddy and of this whole ending. It reminds me so much of lixians old animations of fnaf
Inscryptiiiiiooooon please :)
Quitter.
Maybe try playing the princess quest games? I remember a statement about one in a duffel bag. Not sure if u got it or Matpat did.
Hopefully you keep playing and choose the leave ending
THE BEGGING OF THE VIDEO LAMSMSKS
FIND ME PAPI 😩😩😩
20:38 HOLY SH*T ITS A HAUNTED DOOR
I hate how we didn't learn more about Vanessa in this game and then she dies...or william shows up cause why not? lol
NOICE
Man what a mess of a game, like i would imagine if they just use a fkin normal save function like literally every game that has come out in the last decade. And god forsake NOT take away the player's ability to save ENTIRELY when they want to do ending hunting. The game would be infinitely better than it currently is.
Game: “charging stations are disabled” Mark: “I’M GONNA GET IN THE CHARGING STATION”🖤🖤🖤
28:37 never thought that his voice would get so high lmaoooo
i wonder why they changed the way freddy's pathfinding works since it seemed to be working fine beforehand.
So far, the entire first 15 minutes of this episode is a masterclass in how not to pay attention to directions.
Mark: *calls freddy an asshole for not showing up*  Also Mark: *literally spamming the hell out of the summon freddy button*
Considering the buggy state of this game, its disturbing that i legit cant tell if that comic strip panel and the hard random cuts to cutscenes wasnt Scott just being cheap.
mark screaming for freddy like nicki hitting that ari note
FREDDY YOU BASTAAAAAARD!!
I have a theory! Soo remember kinda in the beginning we could choose Monty's golf and Fazer blast. I think if we choose Monty's golf we could defeat him and get his claws to upgrade Freddie before 6AM. Leading to getting all the 3 animatronics upgrades and defeating Vanny. It would be a lot harder playing without the Fazer Blaster gun but i think they did that so it would be harder to get the "secret"
Awe markimoo, no explanation of the dum dum stupidness involving how the recharge stations were turned off for the last hour
Still waiting to be found for not clicking on the links.
27:29AMONGUS!!!!!!
Mark sure does loses his insanity when Freddy doesn’t come.
This video is 30 minutes of Mark not listening to the game at all lmao
when freddy was being ripped apart I was scream laughing 15:29 . That ending was so jarring but kinda cool
I love how Freddy just passed by Mark without looking at him LMAO.
28:43 PLEASE I CANT STOP REPLAYING THIS JUST FREDDY RUNNING TOWARDS MONTY INSTEAD OF MARK AND MARK SCREAMING
I like that it’s a refreshing take on the franchise and a fun play, but my GOD is this a poorly made/designed fucking game lol. Ik ik angry fnaf children, it was rushed (by y’all), and glitches happen but it’s not even about the glitches. The level design is awful, plot makes no sense, and the endings?? Don’t even get me started lol
it got 5 end
if Vanny is Vanessa, then child just order to rip living girl's body apart in front of him. It can traumatized child for life. Child in game: oh, no, Freddie broken, it can take more that hour to fix him.
I've been waiting all day for this
I think that Freddy just goes to the spot at which you actually summoned him. So if you hit the button, and then keep running, he’ll walk right past you to get to the spot where you were at the time of summoning him.
28:40 jajaja
Wait he not gona play it agin?
There are so many endings man
wasnt expecting that intro
This game seams so badly executed in terms of user experience
So many things in this game feel completely random... It's all so confusing. It almost feels like the devs bit off more than they could chew, and made the game way too big. I'm sure Covid didn't do it any favors, either. Also the entire Vanny ending felt like it came out of nowhere, the entire thing feels like it's out of context.
Tbh Vanessa was joshing with you and you fell for it lol Edit: You have to play Princess Quest 1-3 to save Vanny/Vanessa that’s another ending. The only way to get the true ending you have to fight against a certain villain who can’t seem to die.
Mr E plier you need to go play the princess quest arcades!!
Guys Vanessa is a furry
Now when does the movie come out?
All the jumpscares: - spoilers: - - - 7:28 (Moon?) 10:44 (Moon) 12:22 (Moon) 27:53 (Mapbot) 28:26 (Mapbot) 29:14 (Monty)
Mark, this is something that will help you IMMENSELY for this part. Go back to Roxy Raceway and pick up the damaged STAFF racing bot head again. That resets the clock to 5am and will allow you to save the game normally. This is a MUST DO.
The reason why Freddy always goes in a different direction rather than going to you is because he's coded to go the the "place" where you pressed the call for him rather than going directly to you. It would've been convenient if the call was coded directly to Gregory himself so that you don't have to spam multiple times.  And the call has has some sort of cooldown like I guess 3 or 5 seconds before Freddy can be called again. If you spam it, it'll be inconvenient at times without actually knowing how to time the cooldown right. Like that time where Freddy ignored Markiplier during the chase because he was focused on the place where he got called, he spammed the call but the cooldown hasn't finished yet.
What a disappointment of a game. I can’t believe how bad this one is after all the work they put into it to make it look so cosmetically appealing. This is what happens when you rush to release a game and don’t focus on quality.
5:10 Everyone watching Mark walk in ANY direction but towards the exit
Can we somehow see the uncut video :D
Is nobody talking about the “it’s almost a 🐓” at the beginning
I thought I heard a high-pitched voice yelling “FREDDY!!!” earlier today, their screams echoing across this great land. It’s nice to know it was just Mark having a bad time.
Okay, so this is a bit of rant-statement? I don’t know what to call it, I want to put my thoughts out for people who may or may not want to hear it, and I wonder if anyone else agrees with me  I have a feeling that the people who worked on this game, while they worked very hard, just didn’t do as much as the franchise deserves..at least with the right thought. I’m more talking about Steel Wool Studios, not Scott Cawthon. The game feels like an empty husk of promises and expectations that ended up giving a bad addition to the franchise. Ever since Scott left FNAF, the franchise seems like it’s dying; Scott being apart of FNAF gave an essence of inspiration that the studios can’t. It’s a shame that he left, but I don’t blame him for the reasons he did. I just wish this game lived up to the greatness some of the other games did, even though I know whole-heartedly that without Scott, it never will. The game’s filled with bugs and glitches, sure, those are fixable. But the foundation, the idea, the mechanics, and the aspects of the game that try to be FNAF but different all function in a weird, awkward, and chaotic mess of a game.   And I honestly feel bad for Mark. He’s expressed plainly that this is so different from the other games, and he doesn’t know how to exactly feel about it. He probably wants to enjoy the game but there’s so much he can’t look past that make him absolutely lose his mind with how that game works.   And that ending? That was..atrocious. I’ve never really seen an ending that had that little work put into it. Especially after the beautiful visuals and the expansiveness this game provides. I get it’s not the real ending, but it’s still a terrible placeholder   TLDR: The work to make the game was there, but the personality and the things that made FNAF so special aren’t. And it feels like the franchise is dying.  If you’re a person who owns this game, has played through it, knows the ending, can you comment or say your thoughts on it? I wonder what players besides Mark think about the game and if it deserves the reaction it’s been getting… which I guess is mostly mixed. I get the vibe that not a lot of people know how to feel about the game
let's all go to the lobby reference yay!
Poor mark 😭 freddy already said before that hiding in the recharge stations doesnt work ever since the daycare attendant's 2nd appearance   And also freddy is summoned to your location at the last time you clicked the button so if you leave that point, he goes to your past location anyway
Markiplier sounded like he wanted some calcium at the end of this video.
If you want to save, just go to Roxy Raceway, recollect the head at the dummy crate, and it will set you back to 5:15 with save slots, but the post-6 am events stay intact. Not sure if it was patched yet or not
bro nice way keeping up with the daily uploads
I doubt you want it, and I'm sure it's been said, but you can glitch to be able to save if you pick up the head to the go-kart driving bot in Roxy's Raceway again. :]
I hope he knows there’s six different endings, and you have to do different things to get them… 👀
Maybe the ending got leaked so they had to change it. Kind of like Mass Effect 3. As a matter of fact, it seems exactly like Mass Effect 3 given that you literally choose your ending.
Mark: 😀
So, I've been subscribed to Mark since he was at about 400k subs...I kind of fell out of love with his videos and haven't watched in several years. I started again with this series for no particular reason and he is still so hilarious and entertaining. I'm glad I'm back.
This game wanted to be something good. Maybe one day it will be. But boy howdy does it need a whole year's worth of bug fixes, coherence updates and quality of life implementations.  What in the sweet sam heck were they thinking with that "Save stations will be disabled if you stay!" nonsense. I cannot articulate how incredibly stupid that is. It was already at the point of mind-numbingly stupid that they were sometimes unavailable.  That storyboard nonce completely trashed what should have been an intense and emotional ending. Swaths of the pre-built world are just unused save for a collectible crawl when you get instant-gged... They updated Freddy to work worse... It just keeps going and going, like an Energizer Bunny... Unlike Bonnie, apparently. >.>
i wish he took Freddy to bonnie’s bowling area up top it’s sad :(
Freddy was just out for a casual jog while mark was about to be eaten
MARK:IM DONE/ME:WITH THE SERIES? OR FOR NOW?
The fact that Mark gets lost so many times, Is either Mark is an actual idiot or the game itself is badly designed
Part of the problem at the end with how mark uses Freddy is that he doesn't seem to realize that spamming the button is making Freddy's AI get all buggy. Like if he just pressed it once and waited for Freddy and kited Monty he'd probably have lived but he wouldn't do that for some reason lmao
I hope that he doesn't give up and not get the true ending
this part was cool and boring at the same time
the fact that dan actually had to work so hard to get the vanny ending whilst mark didnt have to is hilarious
Oooh. So you can’t save. Well that sucks.  Hopefully you can still save now that you’ve gone through that sequence? idk- I almost cried when Freddy died, but uhhh.. I knew that was the worst ending to get too. Unless there’s even worse.  Don’t tell me though.  There’s a lot more to this, like Mark said. And of course the way Freddy ran past him sent meeeee- xD Once again, no spoilers in the replies. I’m still waiting for Mark. :D
I really mean it when I say thanks Mark! The uploading grind is insane and these videos have really entertained me for the last week :)
Mark sounded like a dying horse after the ending with Vanny
Damn I didn't hear Mark scream like that in such a while. I am loving this series.
Tha AI has so many issues in terms of path-finding and the teleporting is so immerion breaking that I truly believe that there must have been some major direction change in terms of gameplay. That change has let to them being unable to give the animatronixs an appropriate pathfinding AI which is why so many guardbots are placed down and why the animatronics teleport so much. The entire hub area also feels like filler especially after Vanny has showed up. The bunny has ONE close encounter with Gregory and you might not see her again ever after that point. Vanessa is the same and that she is not suspicious of seeing Freddy walking around after she had detatched the head was really bothering me. They obviously wanted the upgrade mechanic, but did not bother considering the consequences for character interactions.  Freddy also bothered me as at the beginning he is just "Ah, sure kid, I will help you out of here!" while constantly talking back on Gregory calling out the shit that is going on, but at the end Freddy acts as if he has been investigating the entire time!  ALSO: The game starts telling you to survive til 6am to leave, but then the doors open before 6am AND waiting until 6am kills you...
Freddy running past markiplier when he desperately needed him was so hilarious
The way Freddy was running some place else like he has a job interview he'd be late to has me cackling
Yes we do enjoy your pain
“Vanny” is vanessa in a stitched bunny suit, Gregory just watched her get torn to shreds by bots. The change in animation made it clear bcuz of the stitches and folds in the bunny suit 👀
then end has me crying
I feel bad for mark because of how poorly made this game is
This game is mediocre at best and so buggy
hm i don’t think the vanny choice is supposed to be there. i don’t know for sure but it seems like it could be an early thing they forgot to remove that just brings you to one of the endings as a fast way to test it out. i mean i’m probably wrong but that’s my guess since there was no explanation for it.
You gotta find the 3 princess games for a good Vanny ending.
Hey Mark, there is s glitch head at Roxy Raceway, if u collect the Robot head it will glitch which then you can Save ur game and use the charging station.
this is the most ambitious entry yet in the FNAF franchise and I wish Scott held on to it for longer and fixed it.  it has a good premise and a never-seen-before gameplay when it comes to the franchise and it could've been jaw dropping if the game wasn't released in this state.
Me when he says, “I guess the PRINCESS QUEST games are not important” noooooo
Freddy running past Gregory and Monty up the steps to bum-fuck nowhere was some of the funniest shit I've ever seen and is probably my favorite part of the whole playthrough so far. What a way to illustrate how broken the game is. XD
i've grown too attached to Freddy
There are more choices the marketplace
now that mark has posted my birthday is complete
Mark crying after freddy essentially dies, *just out of nowhere* "HEY, wanna play some video games??? i know I do!"
I think theirs a glitch where you can pick up the service bot head again, and for some reason it lets you save again. It might helpful with how easy you can just get your neck snapped in this game
Heyyy mark after all the endings there’s another 2 the true and princess quest ending do that pleasee i wanna see your reaction HAHAHAHAHA
I don’t get why this game is so unpolished and just..not good..maybe it’s coz Scott quit
This game is not polished enough to warrant a permadeath ending
Loved that amazing ending LFMAO
The king wants his crown
the pure rage of that buh-bye
I think Mark was on to something about the game not being what was originally intended.  Between what Mark said, the boatload of glitches, and some basic questions I have;  something is not right.  And my questions I feel like I missed an intro establishing Gregory.  How did he end up in Freddy in the beginning?  Did his parents just abandon him?  Why doesn't he trust the security personnel?
Why don't you just leave
Freddy really said after you monty
For people wondering what the patch is. There was this massive game breaking bug where if you jumped at the same time you enter freddy you for some reason de render the entire map and you can just clip through walls. Highly likely they patched that out and not anything to do with freddies pathing, its never worked to begin with
mark should do ending with springtrap
To get Monty’s claws you would have had to get the camera instead of the blaster and then find all princess games to get the true ending when you choose vanny
28:42 HAHA "FREDDY YOU *****" AS FREDDY RAN BY LMAO
mark out of all the 12 years olds here, will you find me?
*FREDDYYYYY* runs past mark
I love when MARK yells *FREDDY!!* SO FRANTICALLY ITS SO HALARIOUSE
17:48 Freddy's "You... are my... superstar" and Iron giants "...Superman..." hit the same.
I haven't laughed that hard in a long time, thank you Markiplier, Freddy and Monty for giving us this moment.
Hi
Dude as soon as it fades into black after Freddy dies I freaking got a Clash at clans add 😂
The one thing Mark is gonna have to be careful with is that Freddy now can no longer recharge.  He's gonna have to hide in the bins/prams/phone booths more and rely less on Freddy being the instant middle finger to the other animatronics, because once Freddy runs out of power, that's it, he's as much of a threat as the other animatronics.
oh god how freddy just run away xD
Could mark have used the chica scream to stop Monty or does it only work with security bots? I'm not sure, don't think I remember a single time he's used it 😹
Damn, they really went the BO4 Zombies route with that ending huh
mark i love ya but i hate waiting a whole day for 40 mins😭
The ending is a j0ke
HOW MANY TIMES DO I GOTTA YELL !!!PRINCESS QUEST!!! Do all the Princess Quest Games Before Going to 'Vanny' That is the ONLY ☆☆☆ ending.  The Secret Elevator Ending will be worth your time too!!  Also GO LOOK AT THE POSTER IN THE THEATER WITH FREDDY: It contains a secret.
U should find all the endings after u finish Anyone agree
I just wanna see mark get all the endings
The reason we love this series so much or why I love this series so much is it's a rage game and a horror game put together and it's perfect for you
That chase while screaming for Freddy 🤣
I don’t think I’ve ever heard Mark scream so high before 😭 “FREDDYYYY”
LET'S GOOOO!!!!
OMG I'm dying. Mark screaming Freddy's name while Monty chases him and Freddy finally shows up, only to run up the stairs away from him. I'm laughing so hard right now
Mark screaming “FREDDY YOU BITCH” at 28:44 killed me. 😂
🤣
There is foreshadowing in Freddy’sstatements
There so many more ending mark you might want look in to this
I'm glad you're getting a different ending mark! Also, merry christmas!
I know this might be a stretch, but what if the wet floor bots are actually the children that have went missing at the Pizza Plex. They do not alert anyone if you are close to them, they just stare, almost as if they are waiting for you to save them. Also, there is no use for a wet floor bot, because signs work just fine. They may clean the floor, but why weren’t they doing it throughout the whole game. The Pizza Plex took misbehaving children, possibly children like Gregory who stayed after close, and turned them into a robot, making them sit there and watch the Pizza Plex for the rest of their lives
Freddy: excuse me Gregory, i need to get to gregory. Excuse me monty, I need to get to Gregory. Wait a moment...
FREDDY YA BASTARD
Moon man can attack you even when you have the suit on so you might want to avoid him
>story-driven game >'true' ending locked behind contrived minigame bullshit  make it make sense
Mark: "Freddy!" Me: *sigh* Freddy get confused, where you click first, he runs there, not always reconize other clicks when spam, when run and click, he gets where you where clicking. ...why am i taling to myself? "  XD
Mark, you DO realize that while you were running from monty you passed not 1 not 2 but 3 SEPERATE hiding spots. Gotta keep those eyes open buddy
xd
The more I see the newer episodes the more I realize why it takes so long for them to be uploaded.
Everyday I would be so impatient for you to post to see the ending lol
Mark go back to the race track and pick up the robots head again no reset the time before six and you can save
I just got done watching some YTPs and the second I open this video I get the wonderous news that it is almost a cock. Brilliant xD
designers: Lets do a comic style so its more emotional  mark: did they run outa budget?
For the True Ending COMPLETE ALL THE Princess Quest
I hope he tries to get all endings
Mark screaming Freddy had me wheezing so hard! 🤣
Mark: "Freddy thank goodness, save me" Freddy: "Sup Monty imma go over hear, tell Greg I say hi."
I feel like this game is a lot longer than it looks like
There are different endings
Im not clicking for your overpriced clothes or your latest vanity project. Come at me ego-maniac
when freddy just ran past when monty was chasing mark lmaoooooooo
...I was not prepared to see Freddy outright murdered. Holy shit.
There IS a second ending to the "Vanny" option. To unlock this you have to complete the "Princess Quest" 1,2&3 arcade cabinets. The third arcade cabinet is playable in her office once you choose the Vanny option.
25:09 knock scared me
Oh this game is a nightmare alright. A buggy, unfinished nightmare. Thank you, Mark, for playing the game so I don't have to support the creator's.
The game tells Mark to go to the exit and he's given just a few minutes to get there. What does he do? He's decides to explore the entire map slowly and runs out of time and is killed several times wondering what happened each time....
Mark: “He’s too far away so I’m fine.” Moon: *Teleports*
wow ngl devs got kinda lazy with this
The blood curdling scream watching Freddy bold up the stairs
Me: *Looking at the comment section* Comment reply's: MARKIPLIER IS GARBAGE!!! MY CONTENT IS WAY BETTER
I think there is more then one ending.
did i nearly start sobbing during the final scene with freddy? NO MY EYES ARE SWEATING LEAVE ME ALONE
The moment of betrayal 28:42
Mark, if you pick up the driver assistant head in Roxy raceway again. You can save
We can all agree this is the best intro markplier ever made
Lets just all appreciate ithe fact that in the Youtube URL for this video is "bruh"
Mark screaming Freddy is the funniest thing I’ve watched this yr. a nice way to end 2021
It really seems like mark doesn't want to play this game at all.
each option at the main entrance of the mega pizza plex has an ending attached to it. the Vanny option has 2 endings. ( you can kill Vanny and get ending 2 or save Vanny by beating the princess quest 3 game in her room and get the 3rd ending.) if you choose to leave you to get the sad ending where Gregory lives on the streets.
Mark, you should not be showing us your suffering, I mean I spent 3 days just trying to find the next thing in the game I was playing. Edit: when you suffer in games, it's painful, like the washing machines.
3:35 imagine this as a jumpscare substitute for people easily frightened.
there's a little exploit where if you go back to roxy raceway and pick up the damaged head again, it lets you save after 6AM
They definitely ran out of budget/time on this. They put so much effort into map design and theres a lot of areas not utilized.
Will markiplayer do all the endings?
mark is so swag
Don't forget about the basement mark, there's something down there drawing large quantities of power and you need Monty's claws to access it.
Mark yelling "Freddy" while being chased gotta be the funniest sh!t ever
I can’t wait for part 8
Play the video game, Princess Quest.
they really need to tone the patrol bots down they seem very very janky and very very broken and can spot you too damn easily and work on freddys pathfinding to the player because holy fuck that is just ridiculous on how often they can spot you and they can spot and grab you multiple times. And if thats a part of the "difficulty" then fuck that man thats just bad game design this aint dark souls
Maybe there's something with those Princess Quests.
Mark: I'm not a masochist! Also Mark: I'm showing you this clip because I know you enjoy my suffering.
FREDDY YOU BASTARD 😂
Mark going: "FREDDY , FREDDY?" And freddy just absolutely stuck not giving a shit about Gregory and the fact that he is being chased by the daycare dude btw you should try and get the 6 endings , they are really interesting and explaining of the story
28:42 Freddy: I've had enough of your BS.... SUPERSTAR!!!!!!
I think you fixed Freddy's malfunction in the beginning 0:00
Me:  am crying yesterday I saw Mark's dms and I was shocked you can see them in my *"About me"* section Hey mark, if you can see this, there’s a second ending to the “vanny” option. Just look around the security office for other interactables
They patched it with a bandage then stuck a needle into the wound right after
end 1/5 done now go 4 the others
Normally, I feel bad for Mark when he gets super angry and frustrated, but that last bit with Freddy being a goof was pretty great.
Lol the "What happened???" Edit😂🤣😂🤣
Please keep playing i love this
18:10 that tore me apart and you sat there laughing about how they used a comic style 🥲
28:43
Mark’s face after he just witness Freddy getting disassembled
Mark there is an important ending, there is a cyclone barrier that leads to a secret ending
I haven't clicked on the links....come find me mark. I want you to.
You should have showed us the leave ending first
Freddy has to go to every point you ping(from what ive seen). Spamming only hurts you.
Come on man get the ture ending and the best ending
Mark there a a secret area you can get to it might blow your mind of who’s In the secret room
Marks expectations of the game:  This is too easy. I'm immortal.  Reality:  Freddy waiting behind Monty politely. also mark: *FREDDaaaAAaY!!! FREDDaaAaY!!! IT'S NOT YOUR TURN TO WAIT GOD DAM-*   *also freaks out when he couldnt find the exit for like 40 min and it was infront of him*
28:43 had me rolling 😂 Mfer just said “nah mate” and dipped
28:41 LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
this isn't in Early Acces???
cringe
Mark! You can get a good ending btw with the vanny option, Just find the princess quest games and play them! ;))
i can't wait to see the animation someone makes for that monty chase scene
Mark, there are 5 or 6 endings that you can unlock! Get them tiger!
Dude, the princess quest game. Also you skipped the leave option? Why, show us all the endings.
Honestly, I don't enjoy your suffering, man. Aside from secondhand rage and frustration, I wanna see progress. Wanna see something new. I could barely stand pogostuck, my guy. But seeing you succeed made it worth it.
This is entertaining like Inscryption and void train.
anyone that has played fallout 4 knows the struggle of glitchy companions
I think theres more to it because it wouldnt be called five nights at freddys for no reason.
I've been watching these videos all day and this part just came out an hour ago! 😂 how lucky am I? I already love this game so much and now I have a leg up on my sister because shes been wanting to play it before seeing videos on it😈
I haven’t played any of the FNAF series,I’ve watched them all, but WTF is this game. Doesn’t seem to follow the old games.
Mark: *laughing and confused at the ending*  Me: *bawling my eyes out at “you’re my superstar”* 😭😭😭
I love the Audio Logs from future Mark whenever he messes up really bad. Very funny.
Honestly, i think i enjoyed watching this playthrough more than i would have enjoyed playing the game. i would have gotten so frustrated and probably quit halfway through. So, props to you Mark. You did will
Just finished part 6 and I hoped that Mark uploaded part 7 lucky he did🙏🏻👍🏻
I might as well tell you that there is a true ending and a secret ending secret is with three arcade games called princess quest or what ever. And true is with all collectibles and upgrades to then bring them to the secret elevator in Roxy race way and that's all I can say
Freddy dies Mark : HAHA LOL WUT
Freddy goes to the point where you called him. If you haven't figured that out yet... Idk how anyone can help.
do all the princess quest video games in order 1&2 then when you get the choice to leave stay or vanny choose vanny then go to her hideout and beat the 3rd princess quest this gets you a 3 star ending
28:45 the fucking screaming omfg
Jumpscares: 3:30 - Moon 7:20 - Moon 10:45 Moon 12:20 Moon 27:50 Security bot 28:25 Security bot  29:10 Monty
they didn't patch the recharge station thing, it's just that they're disabled just before 6
Mark yelling "FREDDY" is just hilarious! 😂
LMAO "did they ran out of budget for the ending?" IM DYING 😂😂
theres an ending where gregory is sitting beside vanessa and freddy's head on a grassy hill staring at the sun, i cant wait to see markiplier get that ending
Bro Mark u the Goat of YouTube man, Much love!!
Vanny is a human in a suit so if they disassemble her  isn't that murder
this documentary style of editing reminds me of the horror compilations of yore.   thank you so much for providing so much fun in your hours of such .... octodad distress,
got so excited when this episode came out just as i finished the last one!!
YESYESYESYESYESYES
There are 5 endings, the secret ending seems to be the true ending
There’s an ending with springtrap(true ending) you need to find the old Freddy pizza resu
You better keep playing this until I get some answers
Not really threatening when he says he'll find us with how high pitched his screams get. :D
Me: "did they run out of b-..." Mark: "did they run out of budget??"
its half 12 at night in the uk right now lol
How has it not reached 5 am yet
When Freddy ran past Mark on the stairs with Mark screaming "Freddy, you b*****! Freddy!" I dropped the phone and fell on the floor laughing. That was too good.
Hey mark you can glitch the game to let you save again at Roxy raceway cause you can get another staffbot head and it will let you save again
The reason there is empty areas is because the fnaf fans are a holes and rushed the game just like cyber punk
Basically the scenes are too graphic too be animated so they do it comic strip style… also *I’M MISSING FREDDY ALREADYYYYY*
MARK! U need to play The Princess Quest arcade game 1, 2 and 3 in order to get the true ending of the game. This game has multiple endings!
Mark screaming Freddy like that was my favorite thing! hahaha
top 10 anime betrayals
2 things mark.  1 did you not hear them say the last hour has no recharge stations  2 Freddy comes to where you call call 1 time and stall for Freddy
Jumpscares:  [3:32] Moon Man (mini) [7:28] Moon Man (just sound) [10:44] Moon Man [12:22] Moon Man [27:52] Staff Bot [28:26] Staff Bot [29:12] Monty Done
I've been screaming "Chica's voicebox" at the screen for the past 10 minutes 😭
It's a shame that the game is as incredibly buggy and clearly unfinished as it is because it does have a lot of potential. If the team that worked on the game just had more time to complete it then it could have been an amazing game.
I felt sadness when Freddy got destroy by the bots :'))
Finally, it's all over. We can finally continue with our lives...  This feels... This feels... ...Antclima-  **OUTRO**
Told you not to spam the Freddy call button Mark.
graphics are top notch, but the story is such an incoherent mess
Mark was right when he guessed that this gameplay was completely different than it was first planned. I rewatched the first trailer for this FNaF and we can see that Vanessa was actually trying to help you escape, not Freddy.
i hope mark gets all the endings
Those were some quality 2014 Mark screams
oh, come on mark you didn't do anything in this video, other than getting lost as you do in every video.
🐊🐻
Freddy: Doesn't care while he was being chased by monty Mark: */Alexa play traitor by Olivia Rodrigo*
Mark, you realize that Freddy is programed in game to go to the location you are at. You are constantly moving, calling him all the time doesn't do anything.
Jesus he’s so mad
All the comments making fun of Mark for making mistakes and being slow I bet haven't even played it themselves.  The game is completely counter intuitive and the bugs, glitches and lag just add to frustration.  Playing this game melts your brain, it's not his fault.
There’s more than 2 endings btw
Damn coulda just atleast went through the leave ending since its pretty braindead obvious you would get an ending immediately but yk. Whatever. Im not mad.
Does anyone else literally wait around until Mark finally uploads the next part 😂
Imma be honest, this game is anything but emotional.
Mark, there IS a way to SAVA AFTER YOU GET TO STAY AT THE MEGAPLEX. You need to get to the raceway and get the ASSIST BOT HEAD, this way you will be able to SAVE the game again.
19:53 "health concerns" AKA guard ripped to shreds
....this game got postponed like 4 times and this is the end...Scott released this on the wrong date it was supposed to be on April 1st
This game is actually terrible
18:00 that’s what I was thinking!!
Mark: FREDDY!!!! (Freddy passes him and Monty going up the stairs) Freddy: why are u yelling at me. U press the button up here, So i go up here
So is he gonna stop here or is he going to continue recording episodes?
this game looks so neat.. and fun and interesting.
Mark: FREDDY!! HELP!!! MONTY IS TRYING TO GET ME Freddy: *You’ll be fine* proceeds to run to the wall   The end with Mark yelling at Freddy was gold, I laughed my butt off
an alien style survival horror with the original animatronics could have been great but this was disappointing
I like that Mark was going on about how some areas seem unused and just. Literally hasn’t done the parts that use the areas yet lol. Like he recognizes he’s gonna but then just forgets as soon as he enters an area
Sus freddy.
This game sucks
Probably someone already said this but Freddy's call sends Freddy to the origin of the call, not to Gregory himself. On top of that, running around different floor at a staircase tends to spawn Freddy on the upper floor for him to then run downstairs (and through walls that he sometimes can't run through but that's this buggy game). The patch from what I've seen hasn't broken Freddy's spawning, this is just the first time Mark has had this issue directly cause problems.
*FREDDAY!!!!*
That monty chase was way more intense than it needed to be holy cow
the way that I formed an emotional attachment to Freddy is fucking CRIMINAL
I love the "did they run out of budget?" comment and nothing mentioned about the newspaper "article" later that literally just says "blah blah blah" and "this article has nothing to do with anything relevant to the game." and "Wackity Smackity" xD
omg its so bad
Freddy is so cute trying to figure out how to get to mark while mark screams to him "FREDDY!!!"
Why is this game so broken?
You a the king of Fnaf I love this series. Keep it up and can u give a shout out to New Zealand 🇳🇿 Thanks
Freddy got discombobulated
Get the Monty claws then break the gate under Roxy raceway
:Freddy dies  Mark: What? WHAT? what? WHAT?
how many episodes is it gonna take for mark to realize that freddy runs to the place you pinged him at, not your actual location lmao
HI MARK!!!!!!
Talk about exaggeration JFC. Yelling at the top of your lungs, just keep it moving dude.
I wanted to watch marks play through of this game first, so I haven’t seen any other perspectives, but this far this game kinda looks like it sucks. it’s choppy and unfinished, the character designs and music are cool but other then that it doesn’t feel like a good game, let alone a fnaf game
Hm. Freddy could use a good spa day at the beauty salon.  Wonder if Mark will treat the Freddster.
The fnaf 6 location is under the pizzeria
Him yelling Freddy's name is stuck in my mind, repeating over and over. And just watching freddy pass him on the stairs as he gets chase by Monty
Hey Mark, FYI there's multiple endings to this game
There is more to the story there are multiple endings I think there's about 5 total.
When mark was chased by monty and screamed ”FREDDY”!! Was the most hilarious thing i have seen in a while
Idk the story the characters and everything else feels like fnaf but the gameplay doesn’t, the gameplay feels like it’s trying too hard to be something it isn’t.
Mark says the game has been patched up it looks worse
Mark i swear to god if u skip more gifts or passes ima hunt u down
so funny im dying at you and the stairs
Mark im sorry but actually it wasn't Vanny's fault... He died due to your enormous fart
i think BB world is meant to be a pisstake (mock) of FNAF World irl that also had glitches and "disappeared" one day
Freddy just sold Markiplier out lmao.
I believe that, since each ending has a different amount of stars, each one represents a different part of the ending. 1 Star: Gregory escapes 2 Stars: Gregory and Freddy escape and/or Vanny is disarmed or destroyed 3 Stars: True Ending (All of these characters escape/happily ever after?)
I meant there’s molten Freddy underneath the pizza  Plex
Mark: I'm not a masochist. Also Mark: Here's a compilation of my pain.
For the true ending, get the monty upgrade and go down to the gate at the bottom of Roxy raceway and break it down. Then use chica’s upgrade to break down the second gate.   For another ending, play all the princess quest games in a row  For a funny ending, get the level 7 security pass and exit through the basement door that’s by the operating controls
28:41 im laughing so hard i can't breathe
I like how this was posted one hour ago
It is so Fucking funny that Mark Scream FREDDY! At A Super High Pitch!
Geez, Vanny got *MASSACRED*
This is such a good game man
Freddy goes where you summoned him not where you are. Also you can hide right next to the bad guys and they won’t find you
Yeah there are six endings three requiring specific things to be done before hand
so was the budget really dead they had to make it into comics?? why ??
Freddy ran pass Gregory is freaking funny as hell!
so... will there be a part 8?
Subtitles for the last two minutes: FREDDY FREDDAY FREDDAY THATS NOT FREDDY, FREDDY DONT WAIT YOUR TURN FREDDY WHERE ARE YOU, OH MY GOD FREDDY YOU BATSERDDDD!!!!!!!!
This game’s design and concept is probably the weirdest thing in the entire fnaf series. I feel that even the developers got confused * while* making it lol.
You know the scrap baby and everything well there’s more time Freddy and his underneath the Pizza Plex
Mark: Did they run out if budget? Me: ...so you WANTED them to animate robots TEARING A WOMAN IN A CLOTH SUIT APART LIMB FROM LIMB?! Bro the screaming alone from the voice acting would have been traumatic. .-.
Considering Scott Cawthon, the creator of FNAF, got canceled by his own fan base mid-production, it makes sense that the game seems to be a bit unfinished.
Hasn’t even started yet and I look at it and go, “30 mins?… ONLY 30 MINS? Is this the end?? This CANT be the end!!!”
I'm so sorry mark, but you screaming for freddy, frantically pressing the button while running for your life, and seeing him come and then immediately run in a completely different direction was one of the funniest things ive seen this year
What bugs me right now is that they talk about other disappearances and such but I cannot recall any of these from the let's play Like of course it's a Freddy Fazbear Pizzaria of course theere are some disappearances But are they mentionned by the game ..? They are a core of the lore apparently since Gregory mentions them but I don't remember seeing information about these
this game feels like a nice pretty restaurant serving you an exotic or foreign meal. It's great, but feels out of the norm sometimes- whether it be glitches, ai bugs, empty scenery, or strange and choppy story moments.
Gregory
There should be a mini video game
When Freddy said “you’re my superstar” I actually teared up
That comic ending was garbo lolol
28:36  ...Freddy sprinting past Gregory, up the stairs and away while Mark screeches Freddy's name is probably the funniest thing on this channel... my GOD.
Freddy politely waits his turn but mark is encouraging him to push Monty out of the way is so funny
28:39 Freddy just decided he had better things to do
here before 1 mil in like 2 seconds lol
My, by far, favorite thing is the little warning sign robot just dramatically turning around to look at him and he's just like "hi" to every single one of them 😂
30:13 You will? That would be epic.
Y'all don't wanna know how many times I was checking to se if this was posted 👩‍🦯
Me:  crying yesterday I saw Mark's dms and I was shocked you can see them in my *"About me"* section Hey mark, if you can see this, there’s a second ending to the “vanny” option. Just look around the security office for other interactables
Ive never seen a self proclaimed king of a game get so lost in said game
When Mark laughed at Freddy's death I lost it 💀💀
You should play the available arcade games, like BB one and most importantly, the Princess ones (in order) you can unlock a secret ending and get more background on the story
I wish I was Amy and I could just hear Mark scream while enjoying my day
He doesn't want to say it, but you can just tell that Mark kind of hates this game.
Wait, Vanessa is a FURRY!?
Come find me then! Then we can go to waffle house and eat!
Hey mark I just wanna say if you didn't notice... The ending you got was a 2 star My guess is that isn't the "best/canon" ending P.s, the patch allowed Freddy to get revenge for people who laugh at him dying
I like to think that immediately after he stops recording and takes a few breathers he will go back to playing right after due to these daily uploads.
Mark: (Calls Freddy) FREDDY Freddy: (Runs pass Mark) Mark: FREDDY
These interludes where Mark narrates how he screwed up have had me dying
game:sadist ending  mark:wheeze
FREDDY!!!!!
I’ve been waiting all day for this 😂😂
Mark you can use the arcade machine and unlock a different ending witch is the best ending
5:15 Freddy said "fuck this shit I'm out"😂😂😂
"FRÊÆY FRÊÆY YOU BIITCH, FREDDY!!!!!!!!"
Why do you have to escape at 6am? Isn't that the start of the next day's shift? Like, all the workers show up and stuff?
Lmao mark not knowing how summoning Freddy works. Edit: He goes to the exact position you’re call him from, always has.
Please play the other endings, you can’t kill him like that 😭
"FREDDY! FREDDY!! FREDDY YOU B-"    😭😭
There r multiple endings. U have to play the princess games to get the true ending. You have to play them in  order there r only three mark u already founf the second one. Also theres an easter egg where u can find the orginal animatronics and freddy has a interaction with thay AKA the good ending
Freddy's like the Avatar: When the world needed him most. . . He vanished.
Freddy: -runs past Mark, screaming for help- me: "et tu, Freddy?"
just letting u know thare are more then 2 endings
The sink whole the draining of power
Only markiplier can make the last 1 minute of the game take 11 minutes longer than it should lol and that’s only how long it took after editing 😂
Freddy only comes to WHERE YOU ARE WHEN YOU CLICK THE SUMMON. Not where you've decided to run to, IMMEDIATELY after summoning him. He won't follow you. He showes up where called. So he will just pass you, or anything else in his process to go to the SPECIFIC SPOT he'd been called. It seems pretty obvious tbh and kinda preferred. If it were the other way around it'd probably get you stuck in nooks and cause a lot more glitching to happen.
why tf is nothing at the main stage
I like how the end it felt like he wanted to punch the camera so badly
STAHP SPAMMING THE BUTTON FOR FREDDY!!!! Kdkgkskrklgv
Him yelling for Freddy is the funniest thing I’ve ever seen
Through out this whole series i love when Mark says Hi to the wet floor sign bots, and when he said The Lore XD
28:40 I have NEVER laughed so hard in all my life I am literally in tears!!
The high pitch scream was hilarious 😂😂😂 I needed that lmao
Mark's talking volume, and his yelling volume had such a HUGE difference, had to adjust the volume every time he started yelling to stop my ears from hurting
These games are…so shit, genuinely the fnaf games are complete garbage, the first one was a cute free game. They should have let it at that. Great story, terrible execution
i understand what mark is saying about the differences for instance there was originally a health system hence all of the med stations about everywhere and a gym which is inaccessible at the moment
awww he didnt kill monty !!
This game is so buggy and unpolished definitely rushed in development
Mark if you click leave there will be another ending   There are a lot of endings to the game
MARK!! If you get the broken head from roxy raceway, then you glitch the game and you can save. It doesn't change anything.
That ending was so lame lmao
Dis better go on for eternity....
"THEY PATCHED THAT!!!!!!!" No they didn't Mr. Bad-Memory-And-Doesn't-Pay-Attention Freddy literally tells you "The daycare attendant is here once again & the recharge stations are deactivated."
Please do what happens when u press leave
"what happed"what happed"what happed"what happed"what happed"what happed"what happed"what happed
The best ending is when you beat the first two princess quest games, then choose the "vanny" option when you go to leave. Instead of hitting the button to disassemble Vanny, play the princess quest 3 game inside of vanny's hideout. That while initiate the only ending cutscene where all of the major characters live happily ever after.
I give you a hint
Boy I can't wait for Markiplier speedrun this game the whole way through to get all of the upgrades as quickly as possible!
Sure, Mark threatens to come find us, but like, I can’t imagine that his ‘find’ pathing is any better than Freddy’s
I love that mark daily uploads even after 7+ years of making content for us
So they disassembled a living human in front of a child, jeez
Mark: *calling freddy over for help*  Freddy: *runs right past him* Mark: *still screaming frantically*
hello comment section. if you pick up the head agin in roxy raceway it allows you to save after 6 AM
Damn... this ending... IF IT IS ONE... SUUUUUUUPER unsatisfying. Real shame.
I was stuck in the same situation where I would die and then have to reinstall the eyes. It made me go insane and have a mental breakdown.
FREDDYYYYYYYY
Game: You can now not use the recharge station! Mark: tries to use the recharge station
"Did they run out of budgt?!" Yeah I don't blame him man, the ending's shouldn't of been those comic strip stuff and should've been fully animated similar to the canon ending I believe.
I feel bad for Mark this is sad
Me to that herring joke ……………….🗿
Idk y but the "You are my Superstar" made me so sad
Let's hope Mark really tries to make it through to the conclusion of the game.
Freddy goes where you were when you summon him. If you keep running around and summoning him from different places he will get to those first
I definitely agree that that comic ending was off. The moment I saw the first page I was like “did they just not have enough time to make a cut scene or something?” Like it seemed so lazy compared to the rest of the game! I was extremely disappointed in that. Plus it didn’t answer any questions AT ALL! Who is Vanny? Why is she there? How come Freddy wasn’t able to see her before and then now suddenly he can? I thought that the Vanny option would answer those but it literally didn’t answer anything and just posed more questions!
8:12 Mark: "Because I know that you for some reason enjoy my suffering."
There's 4 ending when i see others video
29:22 no, more like you're the bastard Mark. You helped kept calling Freddy, but he finally comes near you got away from him.
"Disassemble Vanny!!" JESUS CHRIST THAT GRUESOME
Did anyone else rewind a few times for the intro.....or am I just childish😂😂😂
Me waiting for him to find me because I didn't click on the link be like 😐🤔😩😑🙂😑😐😑😑😑😑😑
me: *crying because freddy died* mark: "did they run out of budget for that last animation?"
15:20  DAMN!!! SHE THICK!!!
also i love this game and wish i had it i love markiplier he is so funny
I don't think I've ever laughed so hard at the name Freddy being screamed before 🤣   I can barely breathe now XD
Wait.. so it’s the end of the series ?.. :(  Btw, that one ending was really just bad. It was indeed like they did run out of budget for the endings.
i can’t be the only one who CRIED when Vanny sent to dismantle Freddy 🥺 i was like nooooo stoppp 🥺🙏🏻 please be okay!
"you are my superstar" PAIN. UNIMAGINABLE PAIN.
Freddy nooooo
Mark: Freddy, I need your help. Freddy: Don't worry Mark, I'm here to help! What you want?! I got your back! *Sees Monty* Oh ! Ummmm, I..... UghhgUmmmmm...... GOOOOOOOOODBYEEEEEEEeeeeeee Mark: FREEEEEEDDDDDDYY, GET YOUR ASS BACK HERE! FREDDY? FREEEEEEDDDDDDYY! Freddy: *Passes Monty* BINGGGGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooo...... Mark and Monty: ....................... ............................ *Monty looks at Mark and strangles him* Mark: *With his last breath* godam it Freddy............!
jumpscares  . . . . . 3:29 moon appears  3:35 moon :/ 7:30 random scream (moon gets mark)  10:45 moon ( i hate him)  12:23 guess who? … it’s moon!  27:52 security bot  28:26 another security bot  29:14 monty :,) (let me know if i missed any)
Hey Mark! If you want to get any of the other endings, heres a *spoiler free* guide to all of them.   *Ending 1.* Leave through the front doors at 6:00 AM  *Ending 2.* Leave through the loading dock red doors (Requires Security Level 7)  *Ending 3.* Leave through the Fire Escape in the Prize Counter  *Ending 4.* Play and win Princess Quest I (Roxy's Salon) and II (where the music man cutscene happened) and then go back to the front doors and pick the Vanny Ending again, but instead of pushing the button in her hideout, play and beat the Princess Quest III arcade machine on the other side of the room.  *Ending 5.* Go through the hidden door on the left side of Roxy Raceway (Requires Monty's claws)
Game : Freddy die’s* Me : literally crying* Mark : did they run out of budget for the last animation Me : mark wtf
I do believe thier development went bad when the main writer and game developer left after people threaten his life. Im not trying start drama just stated that you its hard to build off one mans dream desigm of a game. A artist cabt actaully copy the true artist.
You love the ending but you have a 90 percent satisfaction
dude if you'll pay the rest i have 10$ i can use to buy merch LMAO
There’s A LOT of endings to this game.
Mark: FREDDY!!! Monty: I am not Freddy. Are you talking about this dingus? *Freddy patiently waits for Monty to get down the stairs*
well for what mark said around 25:00, the game was delayed once already and so many people were complaining that it wasn't out that they didn't delay it again and just released it as is, which explains some of the weirdness and bugs. Its honestly a shame that so many game creators end up having to release a game before its finished.
0:03 speed dial be like    if you dont get it you are to young
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation?"   I laughed so f*cking hard.
I shat myself so much with one of the S.T.A.F.F jumpscares my phone jumped out my hand
Ok, I have seen a ton of people (not just here, everywhere around the internet) saying that this game seems unfinished, and it makes me feel horrible for the game devs. We were the ones that asked for this huge game over and over again, and I'm guessing that after a while the devs were trying very hard to get it out as early as possible, causing them to rush and leave more bugs in the game. Plus this game is so much larger than the other games, so it makes sense that the game would have more bugs than the average fnaf game. Sorry I know this was a bit of a ramble, but it's just making me feel so bad. :(
*refuses to click on links in description so Mark comes and finds me* ...
If u pick back up the staff bot head at roxys place it activates saves again
im just saying now
The relationship between greg and freedy is so shallow that it ends up feelings really poorly written (wich it was)
game: "it's almost 6:00AM get out of here"  Mark: "not yet 5 more minutes"
When mark goes "click on the link or I'll come find you" in my head I go yay a new friend to talk to and hangout with
Mark will know when he is at the TRUE ending because someone.... Familiar will show up
Lol, you missed like soooo much extra stuff d;
There's many endings, whit obviously the true ending and the secret ending

Legend has it that Mark is steal screaming "FREDDDDYYYY!!!" to this day.
I am legit cracking up
Man this game could be so much more
gregory, do you see a vent in the floor? have you ever heard of among us gregory? I need you to vent to the other room gregory. I know it will be very sus but i know you can do it gregory
50% of video: mark in agony  25%: visible confusion 69%:FREDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!
I swear Markiplier has the buggiest playthrough of any YouTuber I've seen
This game is guaranteed to break his sanity
I love how even though almost everything he did was perfect, and Mark is renowned for being the king of fnaf, he got the bad ending then proceeded to laugh at it
I was expecting Freddy to betray you in the end, his fate in the Vanny ending makes me feel bad for doubting him.  A lot of the memos mention video games at the arcade. Maybe playing them will explain some of the story.
Mark: FREDDYYYYYYYYYYY! Freddy: right imma head out
Hey Mark, i'm not trying to spoil the game for you, and therefore i will not! But here's a tip: There are 6 known endings to the game, the most significant ones are: the one you are onto now, (with the Monty claws), and here's a tip to the other significant one: Remember Princess Quest?   I hope this helps, so that we may enjoy a few more of these lovely episodes!
You're right, Mark. Over the summer some major changes were made- one of them Vanny's role being downgraded, if you were wondering why she doesn't show up too much. That explains why there are a lot of incredible moments, but the glue holding them together is less than cohesive.
It is under the pizzeria
markiplier. Do you see that small vent on the ground?
The princess quest ending is the best
"Incohesive" Why does Mark make side quests sound so bad?
im just dying when mark was screaming FREDDY trying to not die from monty 🤣
I’m a fan of fnaf pretty much just cause of markiplier but this fnaf is very garbage, lore is confusing af, game is really glitchy almost unplayable, and nothing makes sense
nobody gonna talk about how Vanny was a person in a suit and the staff bots "dismantled" her while Gregory saw it happen lmao
I died of of laughter the whole time Monty was chasing him lamo
There's an ending that involves the princess quest game
There is a another ending
Mark better do the True Ending
This game gives me DS2 vibes.
IT seems like he goes to where you hit the button, NOT to where you currently are.
Steel Wool Studios: So how about we make the Good Vanny ending somewhat achievable by drawing attention to the game in her room?  Scott: no
Yeah ngl the endings seemed really weird and incoherent to me :/
10:35 with the moonman was hilarious xd He knew that he was coming, but didnt take it serious xd
Wonder if Mark will get all of the different endings? And.... Mark: FREDDY! FREDDY!! Freddy: *ignores him and runs past him* Sup Monty. Mark: FREEEEDDDYYYY!!!!!
22:30 did anyone else see the baby plushie
I'm crying yesterday I saw Mark's dms and I was shocked you can see them in my *"About me"* section Hey mark, if you can see this, there’s a second ending to the “vanny” option. Just look around the security office for other interactables
I absolutely love it when you summon Freddy, and he comes zooming from a direction that's either not logically possible or that you haven't unlocked yet. This game is phenomenal.
Why don't you do the super long gameplays anymore? I miss them instead of having to wait a day just for 30 minutes 🥲. I can't just start watching someone else play the game its obviously not the same. im just so eager to watch you play through the rest of this and keep getting left on cliff hangers.
Mark: watching freddy get dissassembled Me: mark doesnt care about freddy. Mark: stares (THIS HAPPENS IN 15:28
Vanessa sounds like Catra from She-Ra and the princes of power-
I'm in pain
Sounds like Mark actually has a problem with this game.
You missed an entire present in the theater!
Look, the idea of the game is there, it’s good and there are a lot of good parts in the game, but it seems so unfinished and there are so many bugs it’s not funny 😭
i hope he makes a video on the secrets
Hey really really important!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think there is a secret ending with spring trap and the other guys like fun time chica or bunny and a lot of charecters pleassse like for  showing this comment to mark for still playing this game if he quit everything gon be end
This game is great, but dam the ending is shit
Mark’s voice screaming “FREDDY!” reminds me of the old FNAF videos I’ve watched when he failed so many times lmao
*W H A T    H A P P E N E D*
Dang, hope Mark at least tried to go for the other endings, the classic true ending is cool and worth the challenge.
mark: screaming his head off wile running away from Monty Freddy: ight ima head out
Let’s go!!!
Seeing as this video is the most prevalent of the problems I may as well give my opinion. This game is bugged as hell and feels unfinished.  I can understand that Steel Wool probably felt a lot of pressure to get this released or had a deadline to publish the game. And while the game looks finished (I.E. in the visuals, which look quite nice), the gameplay, story, and beta testing as nowhere NEAR done.  In terms of the bug, this is can be fixed probably within a few patches and not boggle down the gameplay just because freddy decides that he's going to go get a Monty Mystery Mix THEN come to your rescue.  However the story feels like its missing an entire CHAPTER of lore and explanation.   Greg brings up disappearances with no prompting previous mention of it, the logs you find from employees and customers don't really add anything to the lore, and I'm sorry, but EVERYBODY hates that EVERY ending has a comic book style. If it's a stylistic choice, it makes no sense, because it has appeared nowhere else within the game.  I'm really hoping there is a giant patch that fixes all of these because currently, with a *40 dollar pricetag,* this pizzaplex ain't worth the price of entry.
28:36 to 28:58 I could not stop laughing 😂
I liked the part where Mark said “what happened” and “are you serious” and “Freddy.”
@ 28:42 the screaming just ends me everytime
Freddy's betrayal was hilarious.  Also, apparently there is a bug that allows you to save after 6. Can't confirm, but for Mark's sake, perhaps worth mentioning given how buggy this game can be.
for mark there are 2 vanny endings and 2 secret endings and then the main leaving one.
Find me Mark I dare you
yes yes yes yes perfect im happy af now
Me waiting non patiently for the next video:
Markiplier "because I know that you for some reason enjoy my suffering"   Me " well your the one who records it"
Yassss I've been waiting all day for this!
Freddy: "These are Roxy's eyes?!"  Also Freddy:   " *tHeSe EyEs aRe aMaZiNg!* "
I wonder why they didn't delay this game. The comic strips has me to believe that they lost time to animate it. Also the fact that there are so many bugs.
28:41 FREDDYYYY YOU BIIITCH
The way Freddy straight up dipped right by mark when he needed him the most is my new favorite thing  💀💀😭
Freddy just ignoring Mark made my day
"you are my superstar"  me: traumatized  Mark: *confused laughing*
this has to be the best and funniest security breach upload he's done so far haha!!!!!
It’s so funny   He got nothing done he has 1 last thing to do and he makes it sooooo hard for himsef
I laughed so hard at Mark's reaction to that insane abrupt ending I had an asthma attack
Its my birthday today and this video made it so much better because of how funny it was, except for freddy dying, that wasn't cool. at all.
17:50 not really sad, they can fix him
19:42 So basically every FNaF game encourages you to 100% the game to get the canon ending to each game is what I'm getting at-
Checked the links :D very noice stuff
28:40 I laugh at this for like a minute when Freddy straight up abandoning Mark then Mark scream out of rage
"There's places we haven't investigated." He says it with such giddiness, that's adorable.
Has anyone told Mark about the thing in roxy raceway. Also Mark there is a way to turn back time in the game and get the save stations to work. And everything will still work like the endings and whatever if u collect the bot head again. It sets the time back to 5:15 and u can save again. It helps alot.
If you want to get another ending:  Find and play all the princess quest games (only two) Find Vanny’s hideout Play the last princess quest And you get another ending!
Game: you can exit the pizzeria but remember the moon animatronic is on the loose and Freddy can't save you Mark: *ignores and gets killed by moon* WHAT?!
Thank you so much for uploading mark, ive been having insomnia for the last couple of nights and you playing fnaf again is helping me so much. Thank you so much
Rushed ending, rushed game...
This game has left me with just one reaction. WTF. Just. This game has left me with one thought, WTF
So from I can tell there was going to be a Vanny section in the game but was cut out during the summer and other stuff were cut out as well. I’m guessing the Vanny section was going to give you more answers and was important to the story. But due to the game being rush for the release, that section might’ve been too large to completely finish so they cut it out. One of the devs also started that due to the lack of play testers Steel Wool was having trouble finding, the game had less than 12 play testers.  So yeah Mark was right about his assumption on the development of the game. Although that beings said the comic endings were done on purpose to indicate that they’re not the true ending. The true ending is fully animated.
I’m going to die listening to his screams of “FREDDY”
when you call Freddy he doesn't go to you he goes to the place you called him. So instead of giving him a million places to go and then leaving you should call him once then loop around.
i feel like the game is probably a bit half baked because scott stepped down practically mid way through production, it would make sense if that was why some things are off
There are multiple endings and the best one is hiding right under your nose and I will to guide you. Step 1: get all the upgrades for Freddy that includes Chicas voice box, Roxy’s eyes and Monty’s claws.   Step 2: once you have all the upgrades go to Roxy raceway and on the right there will be a door that leads you to a set of stairs go down them and follow a path that will lead you to a elevator. When you find it and take it down enjoy and be Careful!!!
Marks pure confusion for so long was amazing- it was just hit after hit on him.
Freddy will always move to the spot that you called him from. So spamming the call button won't do anything. He won't start moving to another location until he's reached the first location he was called to
is this the last ep?
28:42 Top 10 anime betrayals
MARKIPLIER is my soul. Yelling Freeeeddddddy like that is the forking best
28:41 i dont know why but its so funny haha
Freddy was just saying sup to monty while mark was panicing
So if you want to watch someone play this game properly......don't watch Mark......watch him for a laugh at all the failure and watch someone else who plays this properly lol
Did he just say "Get me in you.". Ahem, wait what? 3:15
Good luck finding the remaining five endings.
Man I feel bad for that mic
I cried my father figure 😭
idk if u will make more parts of this game but there is more endings Without spoilers  The BEST ending: Go play Princes Quest 2, then do the Vanny choice again (either at the door or at the loading dock) then play it normaly and play Princess Quest 3 in Vannys room to get ending.   Canon ending: Do Monty to get his upgrade for Freddy, then go back to Roxy Raceway. In the raceway on your left when entering is a door leading down. You can open the gates when you have all of Freddys upgrades. Once you do that take the elevator and enjoy :)  if u escape throught the Loading Docks u will see another ending   By using the Emergency Exit in the Prize Counter area at 6:00 am and choosing the 'Leave' option, u can trigger  another ending    That is all i know, I hope u will make another part, and sorry for my english.
i love how freddy calmly waits for his turn in the starts
Most edge of my seat moment in history
Mark should probably just admit that he doesn’t like how the game is optimized. It’s kind of a buggy mess.   Also the way that you can’t save if you choose to stay is stupid as all hell.
I have a feeling him showing footage of just being lost and slow for a year and a half is just to fill time, it was funny the first couple of times and now it is just annoying, like c'mon get on with the story.
FREDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDY... LMFAO
The scenes in this game are so wacky. They don’t make any sense.
I want an entire playthrough of this game edited like that opening segment
Nice
My personal preference is that the docks have the best ending. You gat a faz dad at the end
So are you going to find the real ending? The way you ended it was very unclear
This whole game is a swearing montage
The comic ending reminds be of the bo4 zombies ending
So uh..was this game finished or....? I mean, wtf was that placeholder-esque ending for Vanny??
The canon ending is def the best one
Freddy must have been so fucking confused when Mark was just signaling him to one place... as he runs by Mark
FREDDYYYY,!!!!!!!!!!
Freddy: dies horribly  Mark: wheezes uncontrollably
Wow this game is terrible
28:41 was hands down the funniest thing ever
The frustration of hearing freddy from too far away
Mark: you serios Me: yes daddy  Mark: you serious  Me:yes daddy  Mark: you serios Me: yes daddy  Mark: you serious  Me:yes daddy Mark: you serios Me: yes daddy  Mark: you serious  Me:yes daddy Mark: you serios Me: yes daddy  Mark: you serious  Me:yes daddy Mark: you serios Me: yes daddy  Mark: you serious  Me:yes daddy Mark: you serios Me: yes daddy  Mark: you serious  Me:yes daddy Mark: you serios Me: yes daddy  Mark: you serious  Me:yes daddy Mark: you serios Me: yes daddy  Mark: you serious  Me:yes daddy Mark: you serios Me: yes daddy  Mark: you serious  Me:yes daddy Mark: you serios Me: yes daddy  Mark: you serious  Me:yes daddy
i love4 ur vids mark
LMAO the intro was GOLD
Roxy is my fave UwU
Hey Mark there is a glitch where if you go to Roxy Raceway and pick up the head, youll be able to save again
Well there is 7 ending
FREDDY'S GLITCH HAD ME IN TEARS ALJKDHSLJG
There is a best ending
Loved the moment where Freddy just ran straight past Gregory 😂 Also, the theatre is used in the game, you’re just playing the end in the wrong order 😆
there is a second vanny ending if you play the arcade machine in vannys room
Developers released unfinished games? Who woulda thought it. This seems like one to skip.
he really chose the one option i prayed he wasn’t gonna choose
Mark seems to have enjoyed more the glitches than the actual game lol.
I still think it's an odd decision to make Freddy go to where you pressed the button, instead of going to the player.
I'm starting to miss those moments of mark and Freddy in the elevator staring into each other's soul
PLEASE— FREDDY WALKING RIGHT PAST HIM—
I love how desperately mark was calling out for Freddy “FREDDYYYY”
This was absolutely hilarious. "FREDDY!"
only 30 mins :( just joking but i was loving the hour videos
Markiplier “ I can milk you.”
its funny how he just kinda rushed through the game and didnt really pay attention to the story and how confused he is
so my friend gave away that freddy would die... this is the last time i'm telling her ANYTHING to prevent spoilers like wtf
Freddy dying: You…are…my superstar… Mark: *wheezes* “did they run out of budget for that last animation?” 17:55
You can hit a recharge before 6 and stop the moon guy
I’m crying rn 😎
I think they used a comic style for the vanny ending so that it would stop the “disassemble vanny” gore cause well vanny is human and disassembling vanny would be ripping human and just doing comic style for that one small bit wouldn’t make sense so the whole cutscene is comic instead
At the middle of the video with the comic, kinda felt like they ran outta budger
why does Vanessa sound hot tho 9:10
Freddy runs past mark Freddy: oh how unfortunate
This game is so disjointed and confusing 😅
The game literally devolved into storyboard cutscenes at the end 💀
Does mark know the stupid creators cut out huge necessary chunks of content and lore and other endings from the game along with the true ending.
Hopefully mark will do a vid on the secret ending
This game is so broken it’s genuinely frustrating me that it’s not working for Mark😂
He still needs to defeat Monty and play the three "Princess Quest" arcade machines. And also he needs to visit THAT secret location.
Freddy not cooperating was the funniest thing ever lmao
I really disagree with how they made get to the exit after Roxy.  Decommissioning all 3 of the animatronics should have been part if the base experience of all playthroughs, not something you can only do in what's essentially a hard mode. But I really enjoyed the game as a whole still. I'm hoping all the fixes they're going to implement and the dlc they're going to do later will make the game feel more complete.
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH THIS ARTICLE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING RELEVANT TO THE GAME BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH B  L  A  H YACKITY YACKITY BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
Getting Monty's Claws and Chica's voice box will allow you to get to a secret elevator in Roxy Raceway, which leads to the true ending.
I’m very invested in this series butttt it’s hard to tell if you will get to the true ending(s)
Try to get the spring trap ending
There are multiple endings, Marliplier!
i think right when vanny killed freddy it hurt me deeply cuz this game made freddy a good anamatronic and i was so happy cuz it made me love him so much, he's changed and im glad and tbh i miss bonnie
Scott left Security Breach before it was completed, that’s why this game appears “unfinished”
I still don’t understand why that random room in Roxy’s “boss arena” was on fire. There’s so much in this game that makes no sense whatsoever. It’s FNAF in nothing but name. It’s weird because it seems like even Mark is a bit turned off by this entry.
I wrote this comment already in the Part 6 but I wanted to share it one more time: The Improv Stock" music algorithm thing used in the DJ's programming (of which the Boss "fight", by the way, felt like a rave and was so much fun) is quite funny since the stock 80's background music used in the entire game location is the same as the one used in Vat19's Gummy Bear(coincidence or conspiracy?) America advertisements. Gummy Bear America is also a shady company creating abominations to profit off of children and the everyday folk; adopting and failing to maintain a family-friendly facade. Deaths are frequent in GBA as the creations turn on their creators and the entire company is over-the-top sketchy. I am BEGGING for a connection between these two series to be made no matter how loose it may be, they compliment each other so well!(upgrade that coincidence into a conspiracy!)
Well gosh, finally Marky Mark! It's been like ages! But finally! You posted!
I think the dev team needs to go back and finish this game. If only people didn't rush them
Was I the only one who ended up in tears from laughing so hard at the end????
Fnaf Security Breach still feels rushed somehow
All but the secret ending are comic style, also that is one of the bad endings where Freddy died. The is one other bad ending and the rest are good.
Wonder if Mark will get the princess quest vanny ending eventually
27:48 I could not stop laughing trough all the chase sequence.
The budget ending masterpiece!
5:13  mark: FREDDY, NO  H E R E  freddy: *literally runs into a random door even tho they're in the same room  mark: W H E R E  A R E  Y O U  G O I N G
18:05 i am very very hard confused, never was that confused in a game. The game is Great done but i am confused
Freddy really said: "nah bro maybe later"
Comments go so quickly here, so just gonna note that Freddy comes where you were when you called him and calling again doesn't update him until he's reached you first location. That freakout at the end was hilarious, but I knew it wouldn't end with anything other than death.
I didn't click on both links, come find me
That's the masochist I know and love FEED MEH YOUR PAIN !!
the fact he says hi to the little yellow bots every time is so funny
knowing all the endings and then watching him missing some important parts made me laught hard
*intentionally doesn't click on links to be able to meet mark*
OH MY GAWD FREDYYYY
Freddy running around Mark but not actually saving him from Monty was a tread XD  It does seem like there's a lot of unused material here. Could very well be the direction of the game changed throughout development. I do like how the gameplay changes throughout, and this does seem like a really fun game. Could do without all the bugs, though. I wonder what's up with Vanny and Vanessa, the 'reward' for our protagonist at the main stage and other such things. Fingers crossed that the next episode will clear a lot of this up!
Oh noooooo mark got that ending oh no no no awww the feels
now you have to restart the game and get all ending on stream lol (not pressuring feel free to not complete the game) this is just the worst ending you can get
Wooooo bunny lady here we goooo!!!
People tell me you'll do more this Is the best part of my day everyday
am crying yesterday I saw Mark's dms and I was shocked you can see them in my *"About me"* section Hey mark, if you can see this, there’s a second ending to the “vanny” option. Just look around the security office for other interactables
It’s obvious everyone commenting hasn’t actually seen all the endings
the ending was both comical and terrifying
I can tell that Mark is slowly getting more tired and irritated by this terrible game.
Bro. Why couldn’t he go through the front of the building?
So in order to get the true ending first you need to get Monty's claws then in roxy raceway there is a door you can now open with those claws once you get through the door you grab freddy and head down an open path that leads straight with freddy, you must be inside freddy in order to start the ending process once there good luck. Edit: sorry I forgot to put that some of these steps so you may want to fact-check them
Am I wrong or did he just have to take a left from their rooms and then another left to get to the entrance.
In all my years of watching Mark, I can't remember the last time his voice had gone like that while he was yelling "fREDDY!!"
There are multiple endings if you want to try to get them all
Mark: "hi" Wet sign bit: "aaahhhh"
Love getting an unfinished game during it's release, unfinished lookin headass ass ass
You said about how there could've been an issue in development that caused areas to not be utilized, but didn't Scott Cawthon resign halfway through it's development due to political issues, views and judgement? Maybe that could be why it feels so strange in areas.
Part 7 already how you're really chugging the views lmao
This game is so beautiful looking but so broken on Ps5 really sad for a fnaf fan
Mark: “FREDDY SAVE ME” Freddy: *literally runs right past him* Mark: *”FREDDAYYYYYY”*   (28:42)
Moon: jumpscares mark.  Mark:what happened 100x
FREDYYYYY  New Phone. Who dis? In a nutshell LOL
There are 6 endings GT is the true end
Mark: "FREDDY!!!" Me: "HIDE!!!"
Someone tell Mark about the fact you can reset the time back to 5ish AM if you choose to stay by picking up the robot head in Roxy Raceway again, and that allows you to save again.
Man, how come every highly anticipated AAA game that comes out now is a hot glitchy unfinished mess?
Bro this game just straight up isn't finished lmao
The game has it's moments.  I agree even with the other endings, this game felt rushed like they wanted to do more but had to cut it.  The story just was poorly executed in the end even if there is going to be a next game
hey mark, there is another bug in the game that could be used to help you! If you collect the broken head a second time after deciding to stay in the pizzaplex, it would randomly set the mission again and open all save stations! 8-bit Ryan decided to use this trick.
I just love that he tries to go into a recharge station when it said that they are all disabled
Thank you Mark for having one brain cell
Mark: "They've completely broken him" Also mark: spamming Freddy's call button despite having multiple examples earlier in his play through that Freddy responds to the first call, not the most recent call
5:52am time . 30min playthru
So that's it? No secret ending? Disappointment surrounds me.
28:54 Fredy-" oh yeah, go ahead Monty! No rush :)"
Freddy was nothing but nice in the entire game and Mark had the audacity to laugh- My heart didn't take that well😭
Mark: *trying to call Freddy*  Freddy:   * casually teleports into the void and back to waste time *
I feel so seen. I had the same problems after the game with Monty and such.
Interesting design choice to make the animatronics footsteps sound like you're stacking Grandma's china instead of like the 500-pound metal machine that they are
He should just come out and say he isn't enjoying this buggy, broken game at all. Keeping it bottled up is unhealthy.
Ngl vanny kinda bad
Freddy’s just taking a stroll by, guys.
Lol awesome
17:23 rate this elim on ascale from 1 to 10
It's really sad and funny how the story of this game is written on it's sleeve. Like, Mark is trying to figure out if they ran out of budget, but my guess is that it was out of time. With the (well warranted) controversies around Scott Cawthon and the impending holiday season on the horizon, you KNOW this thing was RUSHED.   It's almost a linear decrease in quality throughout the game, from the design and creativity of the gameplay to the horribly unfair and janky AI to the quality of the cutscenes.   I mean, there was so much building up to getting into Roxy Raceway and then it's just a cutscene. You KNOW they planned out a minigame where you had to knock Roxy off her cart or something and then hit her with the cart. But someone said it needed to be out by Christmas, so it was just turned into a cutscene.   They didn't even have time to program the save stations to come back online for the last leg of the game. That, or it was the only way they thought they could get a full length game out of it, which wouldn't totally surprise me.  It's sad that instead of a full exploration-adventure-horror FNAF in a spooky 80's pizza-plex, we just got Sonic Boom 2: Animatronic Boogaloo.
Sop
Mark: FREDDY DONT WAIT YOUR TURN!!!
yeah.. ending was shit 😺
Insert "MARKIPLIER IS GARBAGE, MY CONTENT IS BETTER" here
there is another ending in vanny, I wonder if mark knows it later on
It's funny how Mark becomes much angrier and frustrated episode after episode. This game is a buggy mess ahah
Plan A? cut content perhaps?
There’s quite a few endings   One ending is considered the canon ending which requires you to defeat Monty and upgrade Freddy, then head to Roxy raceway again and go to the door where it leds down if you remember where that is; not the door that leads to vent with the fire, the other door next to where you found the head.  Another ending which is the good ending, requires you to find and play all the princess quest games. I believe you already played the first one if I remember correctly which you only need to do the second and third; the second one is where DJMM was chasing you at the end of the hall, the third one is only accessible by choosing the vanny option when your next to an exit, the one you just did.  And the rest are quite simple except one has you to beat Monty again and get the golden Roxy where you need Freddy to open the doors that you first went into the game, where Freddy says you’re hurt, it’s at the stairs and find the fire escape on the third floor which requires all the golden ones of the cast, Freddy, chica, Monty, Roxy, sun, and moon, the sun is at foxy pirate place in the lighthouse and the moon I forget where it is.  And then there’s the one that requires a level seven security badge at the docks next to the kitchen and the last ending is just leaving the place and that’s all of the endings.  I hope this helps you mark.
Bruh why you so boring
This game just feels unfinished, I love that Markiplier played it but the game seems off
Freddy getting even with you not mourning one his sad endings...Superstar
more like One Night at Freddy's? No it's really painful that it's already over.
I can't wait for Mark to see the true ending
I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE CHECKED SOONER OMG
This game lacks everything other FNAF game had. Really annoyingly glitched, not even a scary game and super tediously repetitive. I guess that it should be cool for people that really understand the lore, but for me, a simple mortal, I will keep watching the series because of Mark but really seems that the game doesn't worth it at all. But hey, cool visuals.
Wouldn't it be dope if they made a game thats like this but they do a spiderman no way home and get every freddy together from every time line to take down the bad guy once and for all
I’m dead after those last two minutes 🤣
as much as i love fnaf, this game just wasn’t ready to release yet :( it kinda sours the franchise
so glad he isn’t getting lost anymore cause that all endings video was looking real spicy to me
There’s different endings
Mark if you want the true ending you need to get montys claws and to do that, you need another party pass which is in roxys room
My brother and I laughed in sync while I was watching this video, he asked what I was laughing at and I told him how I was laughing at the part where Freddy runs away from Mark and Mark yells “FREDDY YOU BITCH!!” we were sitting right next to each other and turns out we were both watching this video at the same time. Thank you Mark for touching so many lives.
Freddy: dies Mark: *WHEEZE*
I could be wrong, but It seems that Freddie runs to the specific spot that you summon him to rather than where Gregory is standing. Mark keeps moving away from the areas that he presses the button, so they miss one another.
Mark: “This theatre has no purpose.” The theatre: *Has purpose*
28:38
There are 5 or 6 different endings depending on whether you finish upgrading Freddy, or play the sentient game, or find the hidden cds[that's what the theater is for], or find all the security passes and an alternate exit
Ain't gonna lie -Got all teary eyed boutta cry seeing freddy get ripped up-
there is a “true ending” that you can get, but i highly doubt you can get it on accident without a tutorial. but i know you can get it (the true ending) from a hidden elevator behind a gate in  roxy raceway that you have to smash using freddy after you upgrade him with monty’s claws
Freddy trying to be polite Mark:  Freddy don't wait your turn
Markiplier: FREDDY Freddy: runs passed him, ignoring him in his time of need Markiplier: FREEEDYYYYYYYYYY
Mark: Makes fun of Freddy's death* Also Mark: Getting chased by Monty and screams for Freddy's help* Freddy: Runs up the stairs right past him* "Nah bro I'm good"
Just like old times hope you do all endings tho
How has Mark not realised that Freddy will go to where you were when you summon him by now, not directly to where you are that second?
I don't blame Mark. This FNAF game sucks
But Vanny do got dat Fanny...
this has definitely been the most unpolished fnaf game ever
Mark: *trying to get upstairs*  Freddy:    *I'M NOT BLIND ANYMORE*
Watching him have to do the ocular upgrade again was like watching someone having a near death experience in a dream, waking up, then having the walls torn down to reveal they actually died and went to hell.
0:00 That start is like an intro to YTP, what are you telling us mark?
lol, freddys death made me sad but it just happened so fast that i couldnt even process what happened
"did they run out of budget at the ending" LMAOO
It just occurred to me that Freddy is basically a mech suit
Don’t give up now superstar your almost there lol
Okay so there are 3 endings so you may check the video for all the endings on the game because you may be confused tho just if you wanted to restarted the game you must watch the video before you play because you have to get the Chica Voice, Roxy eyes and Monty hands because the 3 star is a good ending and 1 star is a bad ending and 2 star I will say Medium Ending because ldk if 2 star is either a good or bad ending but l will Unknown or N/A
You also completely missed the Princess Quest III cabinet in Vanessa's hideout
28:43 - mark screaming for his life
Much more than before
Mark in case you somehow didn't realize the Freddy call calls him to where the call was, not to you
This game is unfinished and garbage.
Mark, I simply cant tell you or express to you how much you make me laugh. You’ve helped me with so much, thank you. You make me smile, and I’ve been watching your for many years! I hope everything is well, and again, thank you<3
If you want a to-do type of list, I would recommend to get the Monty Claw upgrade, and then explore beneath roxy's raceway. They were talking about it in those messages that you picked up that something is drawing power from down there and that they were sending a team down there. I think you tried to go there before, but one of those gates were blocking you (if you get the monty upgrade you can go through it).
Geez, Poor Mark is seriously suffering by Moondrop thanks to the annoying bugs.
The space is for maybe the reopening with utilize the other space.  You might have three games on that big complex.
Mark: "FREDDYY!"   *imma just wait my turn because im a polite gentleman*
Each episode Mark goes insane
Markiplier I hope you see this and put it your video, but apparently if you shoot freddy with the laser gun he will swear at you. Test this myth please
Inscryption?
Pretty sure the game is so unfinnished since everyone decided to “cancel” the creator of FNAF
MARK WHY U END THE EP LIKE THAT
I KEEP CATCHING THESE VIDS AN HOUR LATE
The end was so funny Mark: Freddy you bitch!!!!!!!!!!
Hopefully we get all ends from Mark if he can and also first time I saw Mark get caught by Monty
I'm so dissatisfied with marks playthrough.
This was the point where I was just done with the game. THIS ISN'T DIFFICULTY, THIS IS BULLSHIT.
literally every time one of the bots grab him,  I actually yell out "OH. MY. GODDD" with Mark unintentionally
All of us sobbing at the rockstar part and Mark’s wheezing so hard he’s coughing at it.. mans really in a silly n goofy mood 💀
their are many different ending. i don't know how to get them but their are over seven endings? but their is a lot. maybe you will find them.
Here is a random fact from the last episode. That giant robot actually appeared in the FNAF games before, specifically in Freddy's: pizzeria simulator. He was called music man and had a cost of $19000 in very good condition. Just something I randomly remembered while re-watching marks old FNAF content
Mark freddy say the daycare will be lose and al changing things is off
Mate, why the fuck is the vid only 30 minutes long.?.??????? We literally achieved zero progress from where this video started. What the fuck man.
Game: stealth! Mark: *NO*
28:41 If only those eye upgrades helped him see better.
methinks freddie call buitton only works by the location you press the button at so he goes there first and as mark was constantly spamming it  he probs confused freddie and he just kept going in circles. not sure why the game has to have an endgame no save limit tho  seems dumb.  then again as mark said  some things are polished others not.
Mark… Mark… Freddy goes to where you were when you pushed the button. That’s always how it’s been. You know this. He’s run right past you a ton. So… if you push the button and then Run Away from that spot… no, Freddy won’t find you.
Disassemble Vani... wait isnt vani a human...😳 what have you done Gregory
You got three arcade games you need to complete in order to get another ending in the Vanny option. Princess Quest 1, 2, and 3, you’ll find them all over the pizzaplex
Even with all the endings, this game still feels a bit... Lacking?  Compared with the other FNAF games we got, this one not only has a very boring and non-interactive gameplay (considering all the "cool" stuff is shown in unplayable cutscenes), an extremely predictable plotline and unlikeable characters - other than Freddy, Gregory and a brief mention of Bonnie (who isn't shown in the game of course), we get NO characters we could actually get to enjoy...  Since the other animatronics really have no proper history with the franchise, or a dark and twisted lore part like in the previous games, we never get to see them developed.  The ending is super unsatisfying, no matter which one you get... man, I don't know. I'm just really disappointed is all. I'm sad to see this series end so fast, but I really wouldn't want to watch more of the same type of running in circles to collect stuff while avoiding the most boring robot designs ever created. Yes this is an angry rant lmao don't take me seriously.
LMAO THIS IS MAKING CHILD ME SO HAPPY THO
Freddy had enough of Mark and showed how much Mark actually needs him 😂😂
28:45
wow 500 000 veiws in one hour!
as Monty chased mark, his screams became louder. 😆
FREeEeeeeEEeeEEEeDy
its there like a ton of missions left that give alternate endings??
all i want for chrstmass is Voidtrain
Well. That was a wholly dissatisfying turn in the game's plot.
Vanny is venessa
The intro killed me🤣
I would love to see mark make a part 8 to find out every possible ending
keep up the good content
14:12 mark pls leave im dying to see mom again.
I liked this magazine style for the ends, it resembles the fnaf graphics novels, and it seems very fitting (though it is a really cheap way to end a fnaf game of this magnitude).
You should play mafia 3
It killed me when Freddy ran through Mark at 28:42
Idk if Mark knows but you can upgrade your Stamina, Freddy’s battery life when your inside him and a lot of other things. Also, there’s like 5 or 6 different endings
Man, while I do like this game it definitely doesn’t live up to the hype with the glitches. Im hoping for some sort of overhaul of the game, otherwise it’s probably worse that Fnaf World
Bruh mark doesnt even leave the megaplex or did i just miss that part
mark seems to be ageing younger in every video
➡️ 🎁 29:14 ⬅️
Mark, the item Venessa was talking about is on one of the logos at the  main stage area. She did not lie, but you were bamboozled.
"Freddy, don't wait your turn." 😭
I really like Security Breach. It's so much more than any other FNAF game has been in the past; there's just so much to see and do. The closest thing I can compare it to is Joy of Creation, really.  With that being said it does really bum me out how buggy the finished product is on top of the fact that right when it starts to get good the ending just kinda... happens.
I literally died laughing at the end when Mark was being chased and couldn’t get to Fredster
Game: “charging stations are disabled” Mark: “I’M GONNA GET IN THE CHARGING STATION”
27:50 actually got my ass good haha
That intro just radiated YTP energy, and I love it.
Never thought i would laugh at a horror game but when freddy went up the stairs and completely left you behind, that was hilarious
Overall, a very meh story, filled with plotholes, and it shows how they wanted to imitate the succsess of previous entries but took everything at face value, adding random things that they thought worked in previous games.  I thought the story would make sense in the end but it didnt, why is freddy not just sending greggory home, or why isnt he the only one not following orders or malfunctioning? The security guard being the bad guy in a bunny suit is a clear trope to purple man but its just that, no explanation or development behind it, its just is.   Why does freddy even develop a relatioship with greggory when the only thing the kids been doing is destroying freddy's friends and plopping their mauled pieces inside of him with anything but an explanation.    Why is the kid to begin with? Isnt it a super weak reason the "you shut down on the stage and i just waddled in"   The withered STAFF bots? Yeah scary stuff, and thats it. Thats the sum of what they are.   Save spots as diegetic items in the world, but also found in unlikely places for kids stuff to be like a dumpster or a service tunnel.  Whats the goal here? To last til 6 am? Well there doesnt seem to be a shortage of power in the facility, and youre a kid, so why not hide in freddy's room or in a photobooth for 6 hours? Maybe take a nap? No, lets dissasemble robots that LITERALLY wont find youif youre hidden so we can add its pieces to our own robot and do... something? That isnt even properly explained either. What are you gonna do Greggy boy, when you got yourself a super freddy? Just destroy more robots? Claw your way out of the facility? Why would you even stay past 6.  Kids been dissapearing? Why havent we heard or even better, SEEN whats become of them. Hell maybe add some threat to the Vanny character or Vanessa, is she the one doing it? What does she do with the children? Is she a P? A crazy chick with a knack for fursuits? Why does the camera glitch out when seeing her as if shes a SOMA monster? Are we evento having this conversation?  Everything leaves a sensation that there is more to it, hidden in plain sight. There just... isn't.  This game is average in terms of optimization, gameplay features, lore, and everything. Its just a multimillionary budget meh. And the only thing making it entertaining is Mark LAUGHING AT THE BUGS AND RANDOM STUFF THAT HAPPENS.
I don't think Mark realizes that he can actually stop Monty, and just needs to shoot his body.
I’m gonna call Scott
Markiplier: “can I save now?”   Freddy: “these eyes are amazing”🖤🖤🖤
FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDY
Freddy is the real superstar 😭😭😭
this game is such a mess, its kinda embarrassing.
Mark: FREDDYY LET ME INNN!! Freddy: Hold on, i gotta go upstairs real quick
Meh
28:44 that scream of despair and frustration. gladly he's ot doing that in reality because that would annoying a lot of people.
Mark looks like he has no intent of ever playing this again And tbh I don't blame him
freddy just wanted his revenge from u laughing at him.  also i think now u can finally play the princess quest game
The way that mark at the end of the game and don't understand to get rid of moon you charge freddy just hits different .....Ya know?
FREEDDDDDYYYYY DO YOUR FRICKIN JOB!!!!
I'm so glad I wasn't the only one who got the instant death glitch at the end of the game. No matter what you do you die before you can get to the exit. I had to close the game fully and then reopen it.  Edit: They haven't changed Freddy, he goes to the location you called him at and if you call him over and over as you did from several locations he will go to each one. He's always been programmed like that.
Guys I think mark has lost it 😫
how does he manage to make everything so much harder for himself...  at least it makes for good content lmao
PLEASE JUST GO TO THE FRONT DOOR. i had to do it mark, youre still the best and i shout with love
Watching Freddy get torn to shreds made me feel extra guilty for expecting him to turn on us and kill us.  Also Ik that last part was supposed to be tense but I seriously couldn’t stop laughing 😂
Wowowow 1 hour ago
Me: (Excited about the new video)  Mark’s Intro Plays  Me: (Fricking chokes on air)
markiplier asking "what happened" 30 times when you can clearly see he died
This is the most glitched out mess of a game I’ve seen in awhile
I feel like the game designers created the entire map first then tried to create a game revolving around it.
Freddy running away from Mark lmao!
Can't wait for the next episode!!
Mark in fnaf 1 "fredddyyy nooo don't come am gonna die"  Mark in fnaf s.e "pleeeaaase freeddyyyy come i'm about to die !"
Man this boy skipped so much
This really does seem to be the most glitchy of the FNAF games....
I got freaking hic ups from laughing so hard!!! this was the highest pitch I've ever heared you scream HOLY SHIT! XD
The main idea was great but the creators delivered a very poorly-made game, I know 80GBs is a lot to expect something perfect but this game is buggy even in the most important parts of the story… it makes it unenjoyable, and for the last “scene”, before Mark said anything, I thought ‘it seems like they run out of budget’ like bruh, wtf was that! Anyways my final conclusion is that the game had a lot of potential but whoever company made the game ruined it, maybe they needed more time to develop it but whatever, it doesn’t matter anymore.
I love marks content but you’ve deprived us of it for 10 days now
Wow, this game was disappointing. It felt very lazy and rushed at times. So so so many bugs involving the animatronics routing. Confusing objectives, I mean mark didn’t know what to do half the time. Awful pacing and weird plot progression.   I think it’s time for the fnaf series to die here
Freddy: Dies In Cutscene Mark: * Laughs Hysterically *
monty finally got his first kill!
Is no one going to talk about the fact that he tried to go into the recharge station when it specifically says that he can't
Why did the freddy cutscene look like an danganronpa scene for some reason bruh.
Mark please you have been releasing fnaf for a week straight.
28:40 this 100% gonna be animated
These comments have me dead!!!!! I've been laughing for like ten minutes straight!
my man was spamming Q for his life
Mark, there are multiple endings that you can get in this game and you should've played it. (SPOILER!)        1. This ending when you choose to leave but Freddy and Vanny got destroyed.  2. The ending when you can leave with Freddy with a van. Freddy's battery gets low but Gregory used the van battery to revive him and later Gregory and Freddy are enjoying sunrise or sunset (I don't remember) which is the good ending.  3. The ending when Freddy decided to burn the place only to get stopped by Vanny and they both are fighting in rooftop and fall from 300 ft. Gregory unmasked Vanny and found out she's Vanessa only later there's another scene when Vanessa is in the rooftop, look at everything. Probably it's her twin sister or doppelganger.  4. Gregory leaves alone and sleeping under the cardboard with newspaper as his blanket with missing people in the headline only later get found by Vanny.  5. You need to finish all of the three of The Princess Quest arcades and after Gregory finished the third one, all of the Animatronics will get shut down, Vanny's head got separated by its body, Gregory leave the place with dissambled Freddy and finds Vanessa leaves too. And Gregory, Vanessa along with Freddy's head are enjoying the view while eating ice cream.  6. This is the canon ending. You have to upgrade Freddy and defeat the other animatronics and later going underground. You'll find Springtrap which is already burn and you have to fight him by the other animatronics. Later, the place get burn down, Freddy and Gregory escaped, Springtrap try to reach them but get stopped by Molten Freddy and it ends.
*FREDDDDYYY*         *FREEEEDDDAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY*
._. they really switched to a comic for a final cutscene. wow thats lame
This game is so fucking scuffed lol
this can’t be the end of the game-
I cannot believe they thought this was okay, the comics look like something a middle schooler drew in his notebook
Mark being chased by 7 foot gater  Mark: FREDDY FREDDY I NEED YOU RIGHT NOW FREDDY FREDDY!!!  Freddy: if you don’t got that gas money I’ll see ur ass later 👋👋
Where is inscription
Mark" FREDDY!!!"  Monty: Running down stairs after mark  Freddy : Waiting behind Monty having a nice walk
Hi mark thx for making my Xmas *̣̥☆·͙̥❄‧̩̥࿌ིྀ྇˟͙☃️˟͙࿌ིྀ྇‧̩̥❄·͙̥̣☆*̣̥ break better and it's help with my depression thx once again mark
Markiplier: They broke freddy entirely!  Me who chose to never update the game when I bought it minutes after release: "BOW BEFORE MY ETERNAL WISDOM AND POWER!"
I feel like when Scott retired from FNAF maybe he pulled funding for this game and the developers had to compensate. Or maybe not after all, this is a theory. A GAME TH-
previous video: BEWARE! after doing this action you cannot enter the recharge station  This video: Markiplier: Why can't I enter the recharge stationnnnnnn🤣🤣🤣🤣
Never has FNAF been so emotionally compelling
Markiplier: **Dying**  Freddy: "I must go my people need meeeeeeeeee!"
mark criticizing the game: and- *WELCOME TO FAZ BEAR THEATER😁😐*
If you want the real ending try to fine princess quest 1 beat that and then the  other two to get the third one is to do the vanny end but go to the arcade machine  insted of botton and beat that.
Go collect the race car driver head again after you click the stay option. It lets you save the game again.
Freddy comes to where you ping so if you spam it, he’s gonna be confused naturally
28:43 Squeaky Markiplier
Mark: FREDDY, FREDDY!!!!! Freddy: *No*
All the glitches in this game make this so much more entertaining.
GOOD NEWS EVERYONE
hey mark, dont forget to take care of yourself. we love you. have a nice day
I AM ALREADY READY FOR THR NEXT EPISODE I NEED IT 😭
I stay up late just to see this early
I don't know why, but if anyones watched Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events ... Mark is channeling Patrick Warburton, especially with the pausing and narrating.
Mark: F r E d D y!!!!!! Freddy: {runs past} Nope
Does anyone else feel that this game is not anywhere near the quality a fnaf game should be…. Like it’s still good but my  god there’s a lot of bugs and lags and confusion…
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
your neighbors thinking your have a spat with someone named freddy...
Hi mark! And thanks again for the amazing gameplay on that amazing game! Could you please show us next time what happens if you choose to leave the building? Like just before choosing to stay...
Pretty much every single youtuber I've seen play this game doesn't realize that Freddy does not follow you around. If you call him he'll walk to the exact spot you called him on. So if you run away he isn't gonna stop when he meets you or follow you, he's gonna head to the area you called him at.   Makes it so hilarious when things go wrong XD
It just hit me, 7 videos in, but the running noise Freddy makes reminds of the first game when Foxy would run towards the security doors..man I miss the older characters..
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS KEEP GOING
Just for later 24:20 = The last moments before "FREDDDDYYYYY?????"
Aside from how far away he spawns and such, the entire time the way freddy has been summoned is he will go to the location you were at when you called for him, so spamming the button will make him go to every place you were at when you pressed the button in sequential order starting from the first time you pressed the button. Which is why he runs past you sometimes.
Day 159 of Markiplier returning to Castle Crashers with Bob, wade and Jack.
Got the worst ending, laughs at freddy dieing. Youchies
Freddy's pathfinding needs... some work.
I...felt sadness when freddy said "you are my superstar" then shut down..
to get the true ending you have to choose stay, then take the old elevator down where you will destroy springtrap and escape with freddy
Honestly, that ending was so confusing. There's still a lot of holes in the story for me. Maybe because Mark didn't explore thoroughly?
This game is so wack sometimes
Listen, I’ve been a FNAF fan since the very beginning but this game… it’s just not it. It makes me cringe.
I never thought marks voice could reach such high notes
So I think the Vanny ending might go diffirently if you got Monty's claws instead of Roxy's eyes. Plus Freddie isn't coming directly to you, he's coming to where you were when you summoned him, so running around masshing the call button is giving him multiple places he needs to go to, one at a time, unless when pressing it again it erases the last one and replaces it with a new one, in which case same thing applies running and mashing doesn't help.  Unless I hear something about I don't think the game had cut parts, but the parts we see are meant to make the place feel alive, like a real place with all this entertainment and such.  Also personally I'd have made only a few save slots, mainly for the part with roxy and monty so i could see both things with them.  Vanny has a lot going on with her, too much to explain simply, go watch Mattpatt he has stuff on it as do a lot of people that can explain what's up.  One thing that I don't get, is when Vanny set's the bot to dismantle Freddy they don't do this at all, they just damage him a bit. Also I really don't like how the final cut scene is done as a comic, feels kinda off compared to the rest of the game
Mark i love your work, besides the game you just makes every game you play the touch, and give us the best content possible, thank you for everything ❤
Freddy rlly said yall hear sumn?? LMFAOO THATS WHAT U GET U KILLED HIM
Your conclusion is correct.
Game definitely comes off as unpolished at the very least, borderline unfinished at the worst. If I had to guess I think the original plans for the game were too ambitious and due to time/budget constraints a lot of content had to be dropped.
Awww seeing freddy die broke my heart 🥺there should be a happy ending
BRO every episode mark always goes insane its hilarious
j
the comic part was hella weird😐
Watching Markiplier play this game is gold! Can’t wait for the next part. I can only dream of having his sense of humor and flamboyant energy.
i hope this isn't the end yet
Yayayayayayayyaaya lets GOOO!!
This was so funny 😭 FREDDY WHY
I think that explains something in the old games
The way Freddy passing Mark when he needed Freddy just hilarious maybe it's because Mark ignore the broken Freddy ending 😂😂😂
There are 3 endings when you stay, leave, and when you choose vanny. You got the vanny ending, you can get another ending by choosing to leave. However there is a "True" ending by decommissioning monty and i wont spoil the rest.
Mark is going to find you like how Monty found him at the end
Just be glad they didn't keep the springlock animatronics, something tells me that'd end poorly lol
FREDDYYYYYYYY
it's just so funny when freddy just runs past gregory XD
The last words of Markiplier: “FREDDY YOU B*ITCH!”
The Monty chase was hysterical. I was rolling when Freddy ran past Mark and up the stairs
Jumpscares!  3:34 Moondrop jumpscare 7:28 Moondrop jumpscare 7:40 High pitched editing and explosion 10:44 Moondrop jumpscare 12:22 Moondrop jumpscare 15:07-15:35 Vanny cutscene  16:02 Audio cue/Roxy chase (till 16:20) 16:22 Security bot alarm (chica chase till 16:39) 17:10-18:00 Disassemble Vanny cutscene 23:10 Wet floor sign dramatic cue 23:36 The wet floor signs make a buzzing sound now 27:53 Security bot jumpscare (Monty chase till 29:13) 28:26 Security bot jumpscare 29:13 Monty jumpscare   Oh i'm so glad there's more! Lemme know if I missed anything.
Man, Freddy really didn’t wanna work with Mark this episode, huh? Not that I’m complaining, Mark screaming for Freddy is hilarious XD
Just a tip: When you litteraly can’t see anything and see the little dots on your screen- go to a freedy station where he charges- if you don’t…. the noon thing will follow you and attack you after some time. 😄👋😌
For Heavens Sake Mark, FUCKING HIDE! USE THE HIDE MECHANIC!
noooooo fredddyyyyyyy
There are 6 endings to the game, 3 are found by picking leave, 1 that mark got, another with the Vanny path and a final one which I will not even give a hint about. Good luck Mark  He will also probably learn this later but the theater is involved in Monty's path. Also don't mash the summon freddy button as he doesn't come to where you are now but where you were when you pushed it
the way Freddy completely ignored Mark and became friends with Monty..
I knew these vids are pre recorded but just in case Mark you don’t have to collect all the items these just add things like longer battery life for your flashlight and Freddy Just go to gator golf and defeat Monty
27:50
Yeah this has to be one of the most unfinished and undermade games I've seen in a while
Can't stop laughing at this 🤣
Mark, when you were getting chased you called Freddy like 100 times, call him once then go back to the place you called him at so he doesn't run past you trying to get to a spot you called him at.
Mark, if you take Freddy to Bonnie's bowling area, there is a depressing voiceline, I would ride him through it
Just wait untill mark realises theres 7 endings
Freddy also goes to the spot you call him at so he just doesnt come to you if you're walking away from that spot.
The way he busts out laughing when Freddy dies was hesterical
Markiplier: "FREDDY FREDDY YOU BITCH FREDDY FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"  Freddy: *runs away*
That scream at 28:44 is the scream of betrayal, It was beautiful how much emotion you can feel behind it.
This is more bugged than game.
Here's a hint to help with an ending You need all upgrades
why the ending s o sadge
its surprising how little of Vanessa you see in this game given see is fully models you only see her like 4 times
I swear he’s uploading an hour later everyday
HE PICKED THE VANNY ENDING FFS 😡😡😡😡😡😡
Mark had a very similar first run as me except he got the wrong Vanny ending. I got the 3-star first run. That said, ol Freddy never did THAT to me. 27:50
I can't wait until Mark gets to rip Monty's hands off. Hopefully, it's still an option. _Poor Mark, ugh that last bit was just a repeated kick in the face._
Mark screaming Freddy is the best part yet 😆 Everyone treats him like a dog saying stuff like here boy but it seems he needs some obedience training 😆
Mark do more endings pls
no disassemble number 5
I'm addition to my last comment you also need to do the Princess arcade games to complete the true ending and then there's also a big boss fight ending that's probs the best one
I just love how mark forgets it says the the recharge and save stations are both offline, “let me recharge”
I love how part 7 of Mat's playthrough and part 7 of Mark's playthrough released within an hour of each other
Sometimes I want to scream, "calm down and rethink what the f*** your doing!" And then I remember, "oh yes, I'm watching markiplier" and then continue watching while being furious about the most basic information being ignored,..  And then laugh.
It's Freddy sprinting past Mark when he desperately needs him for me
Mark, I'm not sure if you've realized this yet, but Freddy is programmed to go where you call him. Not where you are. And he can't be called to another location until he finishes pathing to a previous location. That's why he'll walk right by you when you're spam-calling him. Because you ran away from the position you called him to.
IN part 7, Markiplier helps Gregory and Freddy to escape the Pizzaplex and they must stop Vanny!
Honestly, the game feels pretty flat after you decide to stay.
This  game seems is not done at all.
Do he reply tho👀
"Fredd-ay! You bitch!" -Markiplier 2021
"The king of Fnaf plays Security Breach"  *expectations*  Mark: Heh, almost to easy  *Reality*  Mark: WHAT IS HAPPENING!!!!, IM LOST!!!
7:30 the what happened show
that fucking intro
All you Gunna try and get all endings
So uhh mark, which of the 6 endings were/are you aiming for?
hey Mark I don’t know if you’ll see this but there are so many other endings there is about seven endings and you can get the good vanny ending by completing all the princess arcade games it’s essentially her hell and it’s Gregory helping her escape
im waiting for markiplier to come find me
Gregory: Freddy I upgraded your eye! Freddy: Good news, it is almost a coc-
This entire playthrough has kind of confirmed the approach I'm taking to playing this game, which is to wait until it gets patched into a reasonable state and then maybe pick it up during a Steam sale (if I think I can handle the jumpscares... yes I'm a wimp). But I think Mark's analysis is dead on: too little time, not enough budget, development issues. There are such good moments in this game, and for me, a hither-to FNAF observer who never really vibed with the mechanics and (lack of) story in the previous games, it looked like a great place for me to jump in and finally play something from this famous series. And you can absolutely tell that people put hours and hours of hard and joyful work into crafting the phenomenal environments and characters and animations and even the voice acting (especially the animatronics'), but there are just so many bugs and polish issues that are difficult to look past. Like all those instruction cards that pop up and interrupt voice lines, or the issues with animatronics bugging through walls, or the unclear storytelling and direction. Maybe the hidden content in the later part of the game makes up for this, but I think it's a shame to see so many big hyped up games releasing in this kind of state, especially after multiple delays, and especially a game that obviously had so much heart and passion poured into it by the studio. I don't really know where I stand on FNAF as a story, but the community and developers are obviously really passionate about telling it, and I hope that Security Breach will get patched into a better state soon. Who knows, it could be the first FNAF game I actually play.
Mark is mad because he made the wrong decision why would you pick Vanny to begin with when you just said this can't be the end so if you didn't want it to be the end why would you just not stay
Para de copiar o alanzoka
The reason why we don’t see all the areas in ONE playthrough is because the game has branching paths based on where you go to get to certain areas
Vanessa: go check the main stage 🤤 WTFF 😂
Hi!
Markimoo, I want cloak brand clothes but can't afford your "affordable" prices :/
I wouldnt say the budget was low, but since they are still a indie game company, its probably a stylistic choice. Plus the true endings are fully animated, maybe the comic ones are off canon endings?
Loving the voice over segments!!!
Mark, a Red Herring is a fish
Hmmmmm...this game needs A FEW patches it seems.
so glad this isnt the last part
This game is such an unpolished buggy mess and a really disappointing letdown.
Is it just me or does mark sometimes have trouble paying attention to what the game is trying to tell him to do, even if it straight up tells him
15:19 ok… is it just me or is Vanny kinda fine-
*top 10 saddest anime deaths:*
What a epic comeback freddy by ignoring mark
Can't wait for him to find spring trap ending
there is like 5 endings mark...
"All areas are underutilized"  *laughs in Monty route*
I almost pissed myself when Freddy zoomed past you
Mark: ¡Freeeeeddyyyy! >=0 Freddy: "change da world my final message good bye"  * procceds to pass right next to him * xD
I really want him to find the original pizza place under this one with the spring trap ending
There is a second Vanny ending. How will you find it? You must find it yourself.
Half of this game is mark not paying attention and the other half is this game making no sense 😂
Why would you pick Vanny to begin with
Mark's slightly deranged "Bu-bye!" at the end really shows how annoyed he was at Freddy
i feel like the creators of this game shouldve taken some more time to either play through the game or have people play through it and find bugs. there have been so many bugs that just have made the game so unenjoyable. i also feel like the creators put way too many places to go in this that were just pointless. like the theater part at the end of this video just seemed so pointless. like the creators were going to do something with it but just got tired of working on the game and gave us a half finished game. this game needed alot more thought put into it.
HI MARK<3 im a little late on this viseo because i was learning ukelele BUT im here now to aay hi<3
GOD this game is not done yet, wow they rushed this
"FREDDYYY!!!!!! FREDDY YOU BASTERED"
Gregory did mention disappearances.
lets go i've been waiting for this
when you stay cant you go to the main stage and see what is there? maybe thats what it meant maybe a thought?
There's multiple things funny and stupid about this video   - it explains multiple times that recharge stations don't work   - he doesn't see the tape that Vanny leaves ( yes I'm pretty sure with the eye upgrade there is a tape)  - Freddy comes to where you call him not to where you are
mark: for some reason you enjoy my sadness/confusion/ETC. We: yes we do🤣🤣🤣
I'm dying. PLEASE DO MORE I LOVE IT!!!!! PLEASEEE I CANT LIVE WITHOUT!!
It's only been 1 hour..
The Freddy moments with him running everywhere would be a perfect animation.
Mark: *FREDDY*   Freddy: im fast as fucc boi
28:41- Biggest betrayal in gaming history!
pog
Im a big Fnaf fan but lets be honest... the map looks good and its amazing, but the whole game is very clunky and the story was scuffed...
WHY WAS THE MONTY CHASING SCENE SO FUCKING SCARY JHSDFJKSHDJFKHJSKDF
I think that moon is a little bit broken in the end
idk if u knew this , but VANNY is a HUMAN ! imagine what happened to her when she got "disassembled"
Mark: "It's tryna give me like 10 different things here" Me knowing there is more than one way to finish this game: "Indeed it is."
This game sucked.
Mark being jumpscared by the security bots will always be the peak of my day
Mark screaming for Freddy’s name while passing him made my night full of laughter
WHAT KIND OF ENDING IS THIS NOOOO 😭😭😭
Is anyone else addicted to the noise of Freddy running...soothes my soul HA
If you pick up the racing dummy head at roxys in the original spot where it was found you can save again Markiplier
I love when markipler uploads a video, who agrees?
hey Mark, just wanted to let you know that there IS a better, complete ending which you get after choosing the stay option. without spoilers, get monty's claws for freddy, go to roxy raceway and entering the raceway on the left there's a stairway leading down which you can access with all of the upgrades. have fun :)
HELP WHEN YOU WHERE SCREAMING
Mark not realising that recharging stations were important until nearly halfway into the video really bugged me, but also made me laugh, lol
Part 1  Mark: "how did i fit in your chest?"        Freddy " Its logic"
The first ending mark found made me cry... And the comic format and style made it feel like a story that we were witnessing.
YASS
I really would like to see you make like a "REAL" last part, since i really enjoyed this series so far and i had a lot of fun watching you suffer in *PAIN* xD
I've never been this early.
Mark: “FREDDY! FREDDY YOU BASTARD!”  Amy in the other room: 👀
Game: You cannot use recharging stations at this time Mark: WHY CAN"T I USE THE RECHARGING STATIONS RIGHT NOW!
Ai issue....
Markiplier losing multiple times at one of the easiest parts of the game
30:40 of mark being confused
something you forgot to notice was freddy was on low power, so youd have to jump out immediately
i just know that people who know the entire fnaf lore are having a field day with this episode
28:42 Freddy said fuck you gregory
freddy: *dies tragically* mark: *laughs like he’ll never again*
Mark, there’s an ending that I think you would love!! Let’s just say it has a lot of old references :) Get monteys claws for Freddy, and then go back to Roxy Raceway and go to that one door that was kinda hidden that when u opened it, u thought it was a trap bc it was really dark. there were stairs that led down, and then a fence. use monteys claws to break the fence, and proceed into that area. :)
INSCRyPTION ?????=)
Congrats you got the super star ending but its not the true ending also you wont find me but if you do it would be an honor to get slayed by a legend
The end card makes the staff bots look like they're *jamming.*
28:43 Nothing will make me laugh harder than hearing Mark's cries into the abyss as Freddy leaves him to die.
When Freddy died and said "Gregory...you are my superstar." I sobbed.
I’m assuming from the comments that Mark forgot about the blocked off area in montys staircase
If you go back to Roxy Raceway and collect the driver assistant head again, it resets the time to 5:15 and you are able to save normally.  It is a glitch, I have done it and it works.
Knowing how there's multiple endings, watch someone come up with an ending where Freddy runs away when Gregory needs him most, sacrificing him
The ending is a bit lacking...a bit dissapointed but Freddy presence makes up for it.
Mark should try to unlock the afton ending where we will see spring trap again. that’s the true ending.
Mark, unironically, YES, Steel Wool had to cut a ton of stuff from the game and had to rush the game out. The producer said so on twitter. He said they've been cutting stuff since the summer. They spent so much time on making the map massive that they didn't have time to fix the gameplay, bugs, or story.
This game is kind of a mess
You can't find me 😊
Aw man i thought we were only half way through the story
Why doesn't Mark listen to the game?
'oh yeah let's go to her hideout' Vanny: dances in a window Vanny: presses a button. Apparently has control over the staff bots. ...were we supposed to know literally anything about her? Freddy: 'guess ill die' Gregory: teleports to fazerblast (did Mark cut that?) Gregory: becomes a comic and can Apparently also control the staff bots Freddy: borderline cringe cheesey last words  Me: '...I feel like I missed something'
Secret ends like all Fnaf games
28:40 was funny as hell
Mark, I only ever watch your playthroughs of fnaf since you're the King of this franchise  I know it's difficult because of how buggy this game is but please get all the endings we all wanna see & hear your thoughts on the lore especially with the true ending  This was a nostalgia run for sure thanks for always making us smile even thru the pain lol
theory: Vanessa/Vanny is a follower of purple guy, that's why they said she was eager to work there, either that or she was inspired and is trying to follow in his footsteps.
The part where Freddy ran past mark and mark screaming at him 😂
Wait the intro reminds me of you know classic ytp moments I’m waiting for him  No links
so this games a multi ending game like the markiplier heist so you prob dont have the hole story
Would it kill developers to release games that actually feel completed? Like selling boardgames with missing pieces.
Why wouldnt he tell the bots to reassemble freddy?
We just gonna skip over the fact those bots ripped vanny apart
It's a shame this game is so glitchy, maybe they should've put off releasing it and worked on it a bit more because it just feels unfinished
i find it amusing that freddy runs to where he called him first then follows the scent so he was doing what he asked
Mark's going through the most with this game lmfao
FREDDY YOU BASTARD !!! Thank Markiplier 🤣🤣
Cheese!
The thing Vanessa side in the elevator was for the stay option
When he started to scream for Freddy… 🤣🤣🤣
Find me then
Freddy goes to the signal so if you call him then move from that spot, he’ll go to where you pressed to call him and not to where you’re standing
MAKE MORE MAKE MORE! PLEASE! MARKIEEE! MAKE MORE!!!!! DONT LEAVEEE YOU ARE NOT DONEEEE!
5:09 freddy running around cluelessly is the funniest shit I've seen today.
No one: Absolutely nobody: Freddy: "Would you like to stay?" Gregory: "Vanny" Freddy: "what do you mean- Gregory: "VANNYYYYYYY"
Watching Mark screw himself spamming Freddy summon at the end was priceless
there are like 7 endings
I literally only wanted to see him leave the building. . .That was the most unsatisfying ending . .ever.
Actually crying cuz Freddy called us his Superstar
Did Mark find anyone who hasn't clicked his links?
Your suffering makes if all worth while.
You can shoot the security/staff bots with the laser 🙃
dude, freddy is running to the specific places you are at when you click the button, its not that hard to understand
Wait until he learns about the [REDACTED] ending.
stay when freddy asks you to stay
I love you the part when he screamed "FREDDY!"
I find it hilarious that mark doesn't realize that pressing the button to summon freddy over and over fucks up his pathing because he goes to where the button was pressed, not where mark is.
There are more endings!!!!!! Do more!!!!!!
I’ve never laughed so hard in my life!! 🤣😭
Why didn't Mark use the Voicebox? Does the Voicebox upgrade have any effect on Moon?
Freddy: Oh, and the charging stations will be offline. Mark, 10 minutes later, looking at a charging station: are you serious
They gave the evil rabbit some nice *thighs* 15:20
Freddy: “dying horribly”  Mark: “did they ran out of budget?”🖤🖤🖤
Mark's heart attack when Monty was coming for him and Freddy was no where to be seen was the best part
Game: "All charging stations are temporarily offline..." Mark: "I gotta get to a charging station..."
Mark  There are A FOUR ENDINGS FOR THIS F***** GAME   all give me like to make mark See it
Freddy running up the stairs past mark and Monty while mark is screaming for his life, haven’t laughed this hard in a while😂
500k views in half an hour is crazy
Hints For The Endings  3 you can get by leaving different exits of the building.  Remember the note that talked about something being under Roxy raceway? Why don't you go see what that is.  There's 3 princess quest arcade machines. Wonder what happens if you find them all.
cant believe mark got disowned by freddy after laughing at his death
Someone needs to tell Mark that Scott stepped down from the Fnaf franchise bc of cancel culture. That's why some parts are very polished but others are just like still in rough alpha.
Freddy just patiently waiting his turn while mark throws a tantrum is the funniest shit-
Your pain brings me joy, you're like Jesus if he was a gamer
😂😂😂
The scene around 13:00 Always makes me sad- Freddy is always sounding so sad and it makes me wanna cry 🥲
Gordon Ramsay Clip: "It's f*ing raw."
There is a huge boss fight ending with a proper ending mark just so ya know... 👀 a proper budget ending. I think there's 6 in total.. Good luck
27:55 FREDDY!!!!
this is just 30 minutes of Mark being confused
SPOILER WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!                                                                                                                                                                             The true ending involves William Afton
What is the plan A mission btw?
freddy comes to the point you pressed the summon button at so if you summon him move he will go to the where you summoned him and then where you are calling him now so if you run well summoning him he will never reach you
Well sorry for wanting to see ur video that why I  came early jeez (this is a joke don't take it personally)
I almost peed myself laughing hysterically at Mark shouting Freddy 😂
28:42 Mark literally running away from Monty, who is trying to kill him and eat all of his bones Freddy: runs to Monty like he is his best friend which he havent seen for 10 years
Mark: "Oh thank god Freddy--" Freddy: "Sup Monty, I don't know this kid, gotta go"
🤪
"Are you serious?" Mark asks 100 times after having been told by freddy over and over and over again, every time he dies, that the recharging stations dont work anymore
I love how mark is losing his mind and questioning why he cant use the charging stations when the game told him the charging stations are offline. Am i surprised he didn’t listen? Not one bit🤣
Do it Mark! FIND ME!!! NO BALLS YOU WILL!!!!
This game definitely screams unfinished. I mean there is a ton of just loosely connected stuff, massive gaps in story telling, and in general kinda half baked gameplay mechanics. Not trying to hate on the game, because clearly there was some serious work put into it. I'm just trying to justify what I'm seeing because it's honestly kind of a let down if their is all it was meant to be.
The games layout feels like it should be way more free roam , but the narrative kinda just forces you to progress. That and the number of useless power chargers , hiding spaces and the entirety of moondrop as a whole. Like moondrop would fit so much better if time passed linearly in a free roam sorta style , giving you the choice to just survive , or to try and progress the narrative.
Omg I died laughing at the hysteric « Freddy you bitch » at 28:45 after shouting for so long, it was awesome
Mark the “extra rooms” that weren’t used were for the Monty golf route to get Monty’s claws. Which you should totally do and play the princess games for the true ending
This was a nice distraction during the holiday rush.  Thank you for your sacrifice, Mark~
this game really feels like they ran out of time and/or budget about 40% into making it? which is really sad because it had so much potential and i love the general aesthetic and plaza vibe. but it's so buggy and the story (?) is being told so loosely and randomly that it's really hard to follow anything. wonder if they're still working on it??
The thematic whiplash at the vanny ending, of Cutscene to Gameplay to Comic. Just wow.
I dont lile it when mark suffers bc its fun to hear his victory stuff and plus i kinda suffer with him when he does
Theres alot of secrets and easter eggs that mark hasnt found , and the arcade game u can play those too! hoping he does those and finds them
me: sobbing as freddy dies mark: HAHAHAHAHAHAH
This game could do with a waypoint system, vanny, proper play testing or a beta, and an auto save system. Apparently the upgrades are supposed to be in an order and roxy is the last upgrade.  The story makes no sense as well. If you need to wait till 6 literally just hide in any of the hiding spots. Why kill Freddy's friends and gear up? There's no enemy after them. Where is Vanessa after that one scene? The game also mentions disappearances for the first time in the ending like we know about them already. After that I'd like to question why sunny is nowhere to be found but moon guy is somehow able to smell our blood and is hostile to Freddy. We also only see Monty in a few scenes. And finally music man. I wanna see more of the big version. Maybe make him more obvious and add some mechanic to make him always close in from above but too big to get you. Then also fuck the small one. Either make it consistent to every vent or take it out. Do something with it. Anything. Maybe just allow Gregory to punt it.
All the glitches in this game make this so much more entertaining. 😂
God I just love this game   I can't play it myself yet but just watching mark play it made me fall inlove with the game  I'm also just inlove with Glamrock Freddy just the way hes such a big metal sweetheart to Gregory.   I'm glad we atleast have one Freddy that's not a killer. (If he does do something awful pls don't spoilt it for me I want to find things out on my one thru marks videos
game: this is the end   this video: 30 minutes long also freddy saying 'you are my superstar' did not make me cry ur tripping
Did Mark ever play Princess Quest in this game?
Maaaaark the game literally tells you that the charging stations don't work in the last hour. You have read that text probably ten times by now...
just seeing how u cant hop in the recharge station makes me so mad i stg
Guess mark forgot that the game is based on a lot of fan lore that Scott has just put into the game as a general thing of figuring out some type of mystery.  So because of there being to much lore that most of it basically just lore intent.  An if not well expect dlc or updates to add stuff back into the game.
28:45 I’m dead 🤣🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀
I know trying to collect stuff isn't as fun when you loose it all if you die, you can use a bug to make save stations work again. so if you go to roxy raceway, you can pick up the driver assist bots head again, this makes the game think it's 5:15, and so you can save again, the game still runs and works as if the clock is 6:00, and you can still use the leave options. this is what others have done to make it so that they don't loose all their progression on collectibles.
the achivements are speak no evil and see no evil now its hear no evil
I’m not clicking those links 😪😪 come over mark
Early balls🙏
Two words.  Save glitch Hope it's still in there somewhere...
omg that ending lmfao
Who's gunna tell Mark he just needs to press Q to call freddy to him
Freddy will be missed 😔
Bruh
is this the final episode?
Go to roxy raceway and by your left there is a door leading down to a secret ending no spoilers but i can tell you it’s the best ending
This game frustrates me, haven't played it but Mark...mad respect. I probably would've stopped playing 5 episodes ago lol
i swear, Mark getting confused in this game are the highlights of my day 😂😂
Freddy wouldn't have helped anyway since he was low on power, stupid.
roxy's eyes only managed to make freddy even blinder jesus christ
Out of what I saw, from your playthrough, it feels like the dev mostly focussed on creating an amazing environment full of unique looking areas and all the various themes that go along with them. And ended up scratching a lot of the core element of a FNAF game, being the animatronics themselves and the story.  It really do feels like they ended up creating an amazing universe and a beautiful Pizzaplex.. And ran out of time to fill it with life. Which is sad, to say the least. I can only hope that as the game bugs get fixed I'll be shown wrong when it comes to that, but right now :   - The animatronics do not feel that unique when they chase after you, and are very, very dumb.  - The story does not progresses properly, and feels very janky at times. (Freddy agrees that there are disappearances and that this is dangerous at the end, without having hinted so until now?)  - Only a very few areas are actually used to push content forward (Such as DJMAN area) , but most of them are simply filled with STAFF bots and animatronics that roam around randomly.  - The progression system is extremely confusing. (I haven't seen a list of missions like that in a long, long time.)  - The tutorials are long, aggravating and pop up in the most random of things. (I think we get how we remove Freddy's eye balls game, thank you.)  All in all, Security Breach really do seem like a miss to me, for now. I can only hope these problems are mostly tied to bugs, instead of development issues. But this isn't looking good.
Frreeeeeeeeddddyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!
Mark btw there are 6 endings
a secret elevator in the Roxy Raceway leads to the True Ending..
You can get a staff bot head, and it'll allow you to save
Freddy calling Gregory Superstar reminds me of the _Go Lil Rockstar_ song. I think it's quiet wholesome.
Mark there is many ending like every fnaf game how are you blind and you played VR fnaf you should have the link made in your head
I don’t mark still realizes that when you summon freddy he will go to the exact spot where you hit the button, you seeing this Mark?
The YouTube link of this video fits so well.
The betrayal in the pitch increase of Mark's screaming as Freddy runs all the way up the stairs had me in tears
Me: starts crying Mark: starts laughing Me:..do you mind? I'm having a moment here
28:40 "Gregory, I have come to help you" "Unfortunately I have forgotten my phone at home, see you in a minute"
Freddy really said “nope you’re on your own” LMAO 😂
You..are...my...superstar.😭😭😭
He sounds genuinely pissed at the end
FREDDY!!!!!!!!!!
Im watching this a 3am and now im not getting to sleep lol
I think they’ve got to add stuff later to let people get into the other areas and also give more clues as to what’s actually happening. I also think Freddy may have gotten confused with all the taps to call him. 😅
YEYEYEYEYEYES
My god I was waiting so long for this episode to come out now I have to wait more 😩😂😂
Mark the William Afton/ spring-trap ending
Ending: *really sad and heartwarming*  Markiplier: *they ran out of budget to make the animation*  Edit: Say whatever you want to say about the ending, I just see it that it was kinda sad.
28:41 The best moment, when your most trusted friend ditches you LOL
Markiplier: oh nice a new fnaf  Also Markiplier: getting #1 Trending on every video on this series so far.
*They totally ran out of budget how can you do freddy so dirty like that and give him such a line cmon man* 😭💀
As Mark laughed at freddys death, so did he
Markiplier screaming Freddy's name was about the funniest thing I've seen in a long time
4endings
You should’ve seen the leave ending before clicking to stay
28:35 🤣🤣🤣😂😂
At least mark faced less bugs and glitches than when I played it. Why are the endings in comic strip form (are they hinting that they're going to make comics of fnaf) the opening cutscene was fully animated so why aren't the endings?
The way Freddy has always just gone to the point where you summon him and not just directly to you is so funny 🤣🤣 I'm sorry for laughing at your suffering Mark 😭😭
FREDDYYYYY YOU BITCH FREEEDDDDYYYYY
Again where the hell is inscription mark I'm getting bored of FNAF I liked the inscription
Freddy was like "F**k this s**t, Im out." at 28:40
Man, this game is kinda an embarrassment to the whole franchise. Oh well. As I stated before, keep milking something, it'll eventually go dry. We don't need anymore FNAF games. 😕
Making it so you couldn't save during the endgame ... I cannot begin to fathom why they thought that was a good idea.
This game is so genuinely unfinished it hurts
If u play all 3 of the princess quest games u get a secret
Could be ya need to head for the stage after you choose the stay option, get that plan A
Favorite quote - “Oh my god, Freddy! Freddy, you bastard!” Time stamp - 29:15
Yea this game is like ass
Mark i respect you and all but you fucking angered me by laughing when Freddy turned off
Who in their right mind thought it is a good idea to disable the save option in the end?
28:42 Can someone please just make an animation of Mark or Gregory calling Freddy a bitch please!!
The reason i think it was a comic book cutscene is so its harder to data mine. same reason call of duty did that with their ending
The game: "ok, so moon is on a rampage for the final time. You can't save, or go in any charging stations" Mark: "WHY CANT I GO IN THE CHARGING STATIONS?" Freddy: these eyes are amazing
ultimate funny moment at 15:22, 17:50, and 27:50!!
28:42 XD
How long till you think people model this, with " custom" good animatronics, aka, foxy, in place of freddy, and, start trying to add " custom map pieces" , like the hello neighbor house, the joy of creation / fnaf 4 house / neighborhood, or, goodness forbid.... UNDERTALE ANIMATRONICS.  .... : /
I think we all love Atrium more than any locations in this game
please he's gotta finish this I hope it doesn't end here
This ending seems severely rushed and flawed, making major timeskips and false objectives during particular instances because they kept just tossing ideas, starting on them, going a different direction and accidentally leaving it in the game or unpolished endings too. Idk the start was great but it's clear they kinda went in random directions at the end.
i have to get this game its awsome
FREDAYYYYY
Was this the last episode
Mark I think freddy just goes to the most recent summon location
i like how mark ended up spending maybe a few hours trying to make about 20 minutes worth of progress
"GOOD NEWS,ITS ALMOST A COCK"
when freddy was taking too long to go to mark and kept going away LMAOO
Not sure if it happened in the video, but what happens if you go to the Stage when Vanessa asks?
Taking away your ability to save during the end (or near end) section of the game is just Artificial difficulty  and poor game design. Other than that tho I'm really liking what I see with this game and I can't wait to see the true ending soon
the part where freddy runs past mark and mark screams "FREDDY YOU BITCH!" so shrill is gold
We just need a montage of Mark saying Freddy
Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach aka *_Markiplier's Descent into Rage Induced Madness_*
That intro
How come it’s such a short eps? I was happy the others were getting longer
good news it’s almost
This is gonna be some kids version of the Iron Giant
28:42 got me dying
Freddie running past you in the stairs is comedy gold
Hearing Mark’s voice go up in Octive’s as Freddy runs right past him has made my day
Mark says he'll find me.  o.o  But has so much trouble finding Freddy.  I think I'm good.
The kings has returned
Mark, my guy, there's like,... 6 or 7 different endings
Marks reaction to Freddy's disability was way too calm
Gotta say, that thumbnail is CLEAN
Can't wait to see mark beat the hell out of Monty 😍 I know its ridiculous but I hate Monty for what he did to my boy bonnie
we need him to find the secret ending
"you are my superstar" got me  wtf no  why wtf aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
19:13 yes Markiplier that is how you get the canon ending or true ending like you said.
Come find me then. I’m waiting.🙂
Pog moment
Was a bit weird watching this video.  Felt like it was personal o.o
I hope markimoo gets all the endings and secrets to this game, I love watching him play security breach
FREDDY! FREDDY, YOU _! FREDDY!!! FREEEEEEDYYYYYY!!!!!!!! LOL! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comic endings are not real. There's one canon ending... It is meh :D Also, the theater has some important stuff for the story. There's a vital pass one needs to make progress, and it is in that theater.
there’s more bots in these comments than in the damn game
hii
Hey, I love you. Have a great day :)
28:42 And this is the reason you don’t spam click Q to call Freddy lol
E
W content
i like how no one is concerned about the "disassemble Vanny" thing when you can clearly see its a human with a costume and those robots literally (probably) tore a human into pieces
So are you gonna do all of the endings or no?
Bruh im so early. The heck
You'll find me? Bro I haven't even found myself
Can we all agree that Mark raging over Freddy is Hilarious 😂😂😂
Holy shit
Honestly i wouldent complain if mark came and found me. Id be pretty hyped to meet him! :D
It's interesting getting to parse together how much of this playthrough is Mark being an idiot and how much is the game being a broken, confusing mess. lmao
I'm pretty sure Freddy will go to the exact location you hit the summons. and since you kept moving, he'd run right past you. I think if you drop him some where you can circle around to again, that might help ya.
Moon attacking Freddy isn't surprising. He did once while you were in the recharge station once already.  Also, to get the true ending, you need to take the old elevator while in Freddy.  I would also like to think that the "issue" would be Scott leaving the franchise because he was found out to be supporting a homophobic Republican.
LOVING the long playthrough videos!!!
Omg I’m fucking dying! Mark screaming for freddy while running from Monty but then freddy walks past mark. It’s the best!
Freddy just.. dying is so odd. that whole cutscene out of nowhere is so odd. We should've at least to the location rather than just get summoned in.
Hey mark, if you can see this, there’s a second ending to the “vanny” option. Just look around the security office for other interactables!
18:00 mark questioning his sanity
Laugh so hard when Mark was chased and Freddy just passed him. Mark just screamed for Freddy… thanks for a great laugh in the morning from Indonesia
one more please!!!!
1 hour late
28:30 and here we see Freddy give Mark ultimate Karma.
*Maybe there was an issue in development* Yea maybe Scott getting canceled. Thanks Obama...
I experienced this today as well so I know his pain
Freddie: *dies*  Markiplier: Pfft hahaha
I'm watching this while drunk and am very confused LMAO
Cant wait to have an animation for this audio lmfao
VERY much so
Sucks to see you pick the bad ending...
I'M CRYYINGNGGV "FREDDDAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
This time, Mark is the one chasing Freddy 🤣
I think that Freddy's path finding system goes to the location where you called him from, not where you currently are
I kind of like the unused area though. Gives it alot more atmosphere in my opinion. Like in this universe this place is not built around this kid and his predicament. This kid is having a problem in the place. If that makes sense.
Game: escape the pizzaplex! Mark: does literally everything except that
Why does the vanny suit have defined badoonkas and waistline tho?
I think Mark is on point here - this game REEKS of 'ran out of budget.' That or someone wanted to push this game out for Xmas at the cost of the game.
just mark screaming “FREDDY!!!!!!” over and over, absolutely laughing my ass off
Freddy running past mark as he's trying to get away from Monty has me dying 😭 Top 10 Anime Betrayals
Freddy is such a himbo i love him
Mark there are actually six different endings to this game! I don't know if you plan to find all of them but the "best" ending requires playing all the princess quest games! Would love to see you finish this entirely I've been watching you since the first fnaf episode you made! 💕
Scott: Trying to make the vanny ending sad  Mark: THEY RUN OUTTA BUDGET?!?!?!
It may be that certain areas, such as the Daycare theater could be lore locations. It's definitely more possible to hide easter eggs in an open-world game. However, it definitely feels like the game was designed in a different way than what was delivered
:'(
YES. YES. YES. YES.
E
I'd let Roxanne wolf peg me.
I waited so long for this video, not losing a single minute, wanting to be updated about this game
It’s shocking to me, and I can’t believe it, but this game is actually worse than the others somehow.  It’s just genuinely a half finished buggy mess with a half baked idea at its core. The storyboard ending legit had to be something they put together in preproduction and just gave up bothering to animate it and decided to just throw the storyboard into the actual game.   The best thing to be said about it is that it really draws on its roots - being an unwritten mess that forced youtubers and confused people to try to write their own plot out of it.  Good for Mark for putting up with it for this long, but for your sanity, tbh I would just stop playing it, because the game doesn’t deserve it.
love you mark
4:14 PLEASE- HE SOUNDS SO HAPPY ABOUT IT- 😭😭 Glamrock freddy was colorblind And the dissemble scenes any parts where he dies 😭😭
Freddy: Dies at a truly sad moment………      Mark: *WHEEZE WHEEZE WHEEEEZE WHEZE WHEEEZE QHEEZE WHEEEEEEZE*
Freddy: "These eyes are amazing"  While he runs past Mark every time he yells for help
28:40 my father when i need help
Noooooooooo
The episode I've been dreading
Mark: What’s the Vanny option do? Game: Enters cutscene. Mark: Gets back into the game. Mark: What am I supposed to do here? That made be laugh so hard I fell of my stool.
i thought i remembered him... less anoying?
Don’t say vanny it s a sad ending
Freddy saying you...are my superstar made me cry and mark is over dieing of laughter saying they didn't have enough budget
please do the true ending
Soo it over then ? Or are you going to get all endings?
I feel as though we should have warned him ahead of time to find all the Freddy Upgrade boosts he could before he got to this point, as well as the fact we should have warned him to make sure he charged Freddy before and only used him when absolutely necessary.  Edit: Also, I really hope he goes on to get the other endings. Like, the good ones. I really want to see how he reacts to the Loading Dock Exit ending. I'm sure he will burst into laughter and just not stop laughing the whole time.
I hope they patch in save stations in the end of the game
I haven’t laughed out loud in a while like I did at the end of this video oh my gosh😂😂😂
It has more ending
i love how freddy walks right past markiplier ignoring him lol
Me: -Trying to read comments and witty responses to it and maybe add to them.  The only response i see: *COPYPASTA MARKIPLIER BAIT AND SPAM*
I feel bad that mark hasn't tried playing the princess quest games- I've watched SO MUCH SB stuff while awaiting imbetween episodes I could guide him myself (not really, I have a horrible memory)
Mark yelling out for Freddy running from Monty has to be the best part! 😆
Mark: FREDDY FREDDY FREDDDDEEEEEEYYY
someone said that the game had 7 endings not sure if its true tho
The absolute best ending is you gotta find the princess quest arcade 1,2,3 beat each of them and have 3 stars.
mark!!!! play princess quest 2 for the true ending!!
❤️
So. I have a question that’s completely unrelated to the video.  When the heck did the “MARKIPLIER IS GARBAGE MY CONTENT IS BETTER.” Trolls come around? Like. Wat? 😐    (Anyways My beloved Markimoo I love you thank you for the great years of content. BOAT DOOOGGG)
It's night in Turkey and my brother is sleeping wish ne luck ya'll
Is it just me….or has this game…been…trash…..buggy, the story is all over the place, nothing makes sense…..it looked and feels rushed…..
Mark there is multiple endings... you're thinking the right things, you just need to find them
HE SHOULDVE JUST LEFT NO FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
So fking short video no bueno
20:48
Hope there's a part 8.
Apparently Freddy in this episode decided to main Jungle and never gank.
Damn im early🙎
Click links or he will come find us, eh? Anyone up for a meet and greet?
Ending being post to be emotional Mark: is this the part where I care
I was so excited when I saw the first video, but this game has honestly disappointed me. It's kind of hard to follow and I think the sheer amount of bugs speak for themselves. I feel like we're missing so much of the story, and the endings aren't very fulfilling.
That fucking pre-intro was amazing XD
It’s funny how he tries and tries but keeps losing to gltichs
GOOD NEWS IT IS ALMOST A COCK
"FREDDY YOU BITCH!!!" I was laughing so hard when he just kept yelling his name.
FRED😸😸😸
Yes, the story WAS going to be different than it is now. Vanny was supposed to be our guide for the first part and you didn't know if you should trust her or not and I asume that is a reason why a lot of rooms are unused. :/
I'm sorry, but this game was awful compared to the others. Clunky gameplay, mediocre story, bad performance, the list goes on. Maybe there is a better ending? I sure hope so, but it's out of the way so most players wouldn't get to experience it, and it only solves one problem anyways.
WE NEED MORE EPISODES AND FASTER
the game might suck a lil bit and have a lot of glitches (and a little unfinished) but gotta appreciate how big they made it. it still has a lot of work put into it imo
Spoiler:                         True ending or at least the hardest one is kill afton again
POV: Your mark.  Says Freddy 5000000 times
FREDDYYYYYYY
I won't spoil it Mark but there are multiple endings and the "true ending" leads you to something you played in the prior FNAF games.  You gotta defeat all the animtronics and fully upgrade Freddy.  Then use the Old Elevator.  You will be in for a shock.
Really?! Comics as a cutscene? No budget left I guess 😂
Freddy: you… are my superstar Me: 🥺🥺
Mark: I will find you
That intro.
Will we be getting another episode?
im dissapointed in the endings of this game. Not even animated
Wait till he finds out what’s under the pizzaplex, what still lies beneath the entire place
Mark: *Laughs at Freddy dying* Freddy: I will get my revenge   A little while later... Freddy: *Runs past Mark* Mark: FREDDY!!! FREDDY!!! Freddy: This is what you get you bit-
Freddy said "na man u got this your on your own"
Freddy gets disassembled in the Vanny ending regardless of how many upgrades he has sadly
So I saved Chica for 6 a.m. ...the buggiest character... ...I think Imma just watch Mark finish and hope hes also doing the true ending. *sits in upset*
🤣🤣 The intro
I LOVE U MARK!!!
There is still one more ending that includes springtrap if you can get it
Which one would you choose? Stay? Leave? Jackspecticeye?
15:29 Freddy being brutally murdered *Confused Markiplier*
Mark please continue the game. We want you to play secret ending. to do that you need to stay and remember u got a party pass, you need to go back to fazer blast and after get chickas voice box again. after u done the upgrade u need to go to roxy's raceway and find the one way staff only door and always move as freddy or most of the time.
Mark never ceases to amaze when it comes to paying attention LOL
Dunno if mark is trying his hardest to be positive about this game but it’s okay king 😭 this game was excruciatingly disappointing in so many parts
If u go back to day care after being kicked out something funny happens 😂
Let's Go
12:10 he actually got you because you were standing still I think. There’s no time to just stand and think stuff when that dude is after you Also, there WAS something in the stage, you can only see it while using Freddy and have to stand quite close to it. It is actually located a little before the main stage lift, where the huge Pizzaplex insignia is plastered on the floor
28:47 FREDDDDDEAAAY
So can we just point out the elephant in the room like the horrible pacing to the ending, instead of Mark’s obvious reaction to this? I’d be wheezing to this as well, cuz no offense, the ending was so sudden that it felt like a joke instead of a genuinely heartfelt moment to Freddy’s death and the destruction of Vanny. Edit: To clarify this, I liked the animation. The animation was great! But what I really wanted to point out was how the ending really started to degrade emotionally.
I haven’t seen any comments about this so I’ll leave one. Is anyone else like REALLY disappointed in this game. Ever since I saw the models for the animatronics I knew it would fall short.
its makes it more funny how buggy the game is lmao
I’ve never actually played the game but I’ve come to realize after watching a lot of YouTubers play it, spamming q is not your friend because Freddy will go to the last place you pressed q at, the developers should fix that fr
0:07 Mark caught doing family unfriendly 😱😱😱😱
Mark *Running from Monty while screaming for Freddy*  Freddy: *runs the other way*
Markiplier taking 8 hours for a single night in fnaf 1-4: It's fine Markiplier now:
The endings are... not good. I feel like they blew the budget on this gigantic "open world" with broken AI and slapped together the multiple endings as a second thought. The secrets don't explain much. The ending artworks don't wrap things up. Even the [REDACTED] ending just comes out of nowhere. For all of the hype, Security Breach was kind of a letdown, but good on them for breaking the formula and trying something different
Mark was actually in a pretty good position in that corner at the end, could've just called Freddy over instead of peeking to get spotted
I kept seeing how people treated Freddy like a dog, but nothing really made it real for me like Mark screaming at Freddy to behave 🤣
*Mark is slowly losing his sanity playing Security Breach*
Try leave pls
Mark: Screaming at Freddy Freddy: *Walking slowly behind Monty*
vannie ending hit me so unexpectedly hard because it reminds me of the iron giant, like his final "you are my superstar" actually hurt me
There’s a glitch where you can pick up the robot head at Roxy raceway to reset the time back to 5:15am so you can finish any objectives/upgrades and collectibles you didn’t acquire before 6am but upgrading Freddy will put the time back to 6am so do the final upgrade last.
I have clicked on distractable the first time u said it
Can't wait to see him do all the endings
i wonder if you’ve stopped to eat or sleep for real between these episodes
🦧                  monke                                       e                              i shat my pants playing fnaf                 im joking
I'm... so confused.
i like to imagine when Mark calls Freddy to follow him when he goes up the elevator and hear his stomping that he’s quickly running up flights of stairs to keep up
Mark is slowing losing himself just for our entertainment
*•Freddy dies•*  Mark: cries in air
I am so sorry, but I died laughing from that outro 😂😂
Yeah Mark the game was originally smaller, the map that Scott got back from the map devs was a lot bigger than he initially thought so he took some extra time to use more of the map.
Play friday night funkin'
I wonder if steel wool studios see's how many fnaf:sb videos end with a soul crushing glitch.
Imagine Mark's neighbors and sh!t just having to deal with him screaming "FREDDY! FREDDYYYYY! FREDDY!" and then finally "FREDDY YOU BASTARD-"   I can just imagine them like "what the hell is wrong with this guy and what did Freddy do to him-"
Freddy don’t wait your turn! I love that part Because I imagine he’s like being so polite and patiently waiting behind Monty on an Escalator and waving at gregory
Kinda feel bad for vanny
1:34 well, good news then mark. there's 6 different endings. So you can play it for as long and as many times as you want lololol
Freddy has the worst pathfinding I have ever seen in a game.
cyberpunk 2.0
alternative title: mark losing his mind over freddy not going where he wants 💀
Freddy screwed mark so much
28:42 that was fucking Golden XD
Fans: devastated Freddy was dismantled  Mark: did they run out of budget??
Why does the vanny suit have honking badoonkas tho
Get the true ending there is one
"Not like this, not like this, FREEAADDDYYYYYYY!!!!! FREEEDDDYYYYY!!!!! not like this not like this! FREDDDYYYY YOU BASTARD"
4:19 was Freddy colorblind?--😃
I was pretty disappointed when I got this ending. A 20 seconds long comic book panel... The whole game is clunky as hell from the gameplay and plot standpoint, but I thought that at least they'd polish up the ending. What disappearances? That was never mentioned during the game. No one has proper characterisation. We just kinda get plopped in the middle of everything. There has to be something beneath the surface here. This is a passing of the torch game for FNAF, the set up of the next big story should have been the main priority! Yes, the mall is very impressive and beautiful, but it's so bare bones and kinda hollow feeling. Steel wool can patch and fix whatever bug they want, but unless they polish the story, I don't really see the point in it tbh. Maybe less time should have been spent creating the mall and more time on the story and the new characters. Through 8bit minigames for example. To my knowledge only 3 are playable. The Princess Quest, Ballon Boy flappy bird bullshit and golf, and only Princess Quest actually means something for the story.  Vanessa doesn't seem like a "reluctant follower" at all. The character is barely present and the duality of her personality, which I'd wager the fans who were paying attention were expecting to see, is nonexistent. Gregory is a complete mystery. He's kinda dick, so I guess that's at least something... Why Freddy is helping is also not addressed. A lot of sensible questions an even casual player would be asking aren't addressed. This whole game is a complete mess. They should've delayed again and given us a finished product. Not just a bug free game, but a game with an actual cohesive narrative and characters.
i know you almost definetly will not see this mark but fuck it, ill tell you anyway. apparently the true/canon ending can only be activated once you have defeated chica, roxy, and monty and gotten their upgrades, and i'm only assuming this needs to happen before the choice you have at 6am.
Hi
Whap power did Chica voice given to Freedy?
The whole scene of mark calling for Freddy with Montuly running had me weak omg
“FrEdDy NoT tHeRe” had me rollin
R34 Vanny and Vanessa
28:37 Markiplier:FREDDY FREDDY Freddy: *runs right pass and leaves for markiplier to die* Markiplier: FREDDY YOU BASTARD *gets jumpscared
Most dramatic and sad part:  Mark: WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeze
maybe i dunno, be stealthy? instead of glueing your shift key down? might help
There is another ending if you play the princess game.
Mark's reaction during freddy's death made the scene like 11 times less depressing so I wasn't sobbing but if I got that ending by myself? I would've been a sobbing mess
Why was there a poster that looking like bonnie was big chungus 😆
Its giving major "Sonic Boom" levels of polish
YYeeeesssss do all the endings!!
Fredy is a very cool Fatherly figure
Mark having no idea what he's doing during this entire series is both hilarious and the most frustrating thing ever
I wonder when he’ll notice that Freddy comes to where he’s summoned, not to you specifically, and that he’s done that since the beginning
Monty- *arrives*  objective- survive
There's a whole game arc where you have to go to the Theatre and retrieve something. Those sorts of things and missions are based on what choices you make in the game.
It definitely feels like they threw their eggs in one basket in the first half of development, then something happened and they had to frantically throw together something with what they had left. Some parts are very lackluster and im personally quite disappointed with the end product. I'd love to see what the game was meant to be.
Wanted go to the old elevator
Hints for the other endings...  Don't forget the other 2 exits that Freddy pointed out to you, in the beginning of the game. (You now have security clearance for those)  Don't forget the messages about Princess Quest  There's a true ending... however none of the above lead to the true ending ;)
Are you going to finish playing amnesia rebirth?
Mark while getting chased by a murderous gator: FREDDY!!!! HELP ME!!!   Freddy: :)
Mark: "I'm done."  Me: "THERE ARE MULTIPLE ENDINGS!"
Honestly Mark, Fnaf SB originally was supposed to be smaller.  But it ended up being bigger than Steel Wool and Scott expected.  Fnaf SB is an incredible game, it just needs to be polished a little. Edit:  There's gonna be a DLC to this game soon.
Game was so shit even the furries will be pissed off:/
Oh god i cried, hhhh. Anyway, Mark should try to get all the endings.
Jumpscare list!  3:34- Moon 7:29- unknown jumpscare?? (Moon) 10:46- Moon again 12:24- you’ll never guess (moon) 27:53- Security bot! 28:27- security bot 29:14- Monty End of the Jumpscares!
Gotta love the Afton outro at the end.
Mark's honestly to this game is great. I'm glad that I am watching this Let's Play here and not by _certain other YouTubers_ that hype the shit out of it and find everything to this "AMAZING". The gameplay of this seems quite enjoyable and I'm dying while waiting for another episode, but the game's obviously not polished and should've got at least a year of optimizing time. I think it's good that I didn't buy this game by myself.
Claim your “Here within an hour pass!” 🎫✨
Looks like you got the bad ending
I think a strong factor in why this game feels like there was supposed to be more is Scott dropping out of the project halfway through :/  He had his reasons and all but I think that might have set back a lot of ideas and things that were planned
If this is actually the end to a game as ambitious as this, it's an absolute joke. Feels super rushed and nothing makes sense. No closure whatsoever, I'm glad I didn't buy this game.
If you want to find out more about Vanny I suggest watching GameTheory
28:42 I’m crying OMG that was too fricking funny
Mark: I hit the summon Freddy button but he's just getting here... maybe if I SPAM IT AND YELL ITLL STOP CONFUSING THE AI !!!
Freddy was probably just pissed that mark started wheezing during his death scene
Why is mark allergic to just hiding? Why, when being chased, will he never just... hide?
Love you
Hi
Mark go down the slide in the daycare for a secret interaction 😶‍🌫️
There are 4 Endings mark. Please find them all on Video.
Top 10 anime betrayals
In all honesty, this probably one of my lesser favorite fnaf games, the characters are probably its best trait, not to mention the graphics/design. But it just lacks in story and the gameplay can be a bit boring/confusing at times.
hi
Mark there r 6 endings, and theres only 1 canon one which involves springtrap, but yu hav to do the princess quest minigames or yu cant do them
FREDDYYYYYYYYY!
Mark u r insane. Thank you for playing this game
More endings plz
Freddy: *dies* Mark: *laughs* Freddy: And I took that personally...
28:40 ong the funniest thing I've seen in a min
Why they make Vanessa a baddie tho
first five nights at freddys game to not go up to five nights? or..?
Mark, each new summon of Freddy doesn't override the previous one, so spamming it just confuses him
“Did they run out of budget for that final scene?”   I agree; It literally feels like they decided to color in the storyboards bc they ran out of time—
What
Can we get a compilation of mark screaming for Freddy lmao
FFFRRREEEEDDDDYYYYY
I’ve been waiting all day for this!!
Seeing that mark made a new episode:I’m so happy!!  Also knowing there is not more to watch after this: I’m so sad!!
wait when he said he was done does he mean done for this vid or done playing fnaf sb?
Mark, you're just being dumb.  Freddy comes to the spot you called for him at which means if you keep moving he wont come to you, on top of the fact that spamming the button wont override previous summons but queue them up.  Be smart.  Summon him once and run in a circle till he gets there.
At 1st Mark wanted nothing to do with Freddy. Even told Freddy to go FUC* HIMSELF!   And now he practically cries for his help: 27:53-29:18  Mean while, Freddy decided to peace outta there!: 28:40-28:50
Just realized that the url of this video literally says "bruh"
In the trailer there was a cutscene where vanessa was looking at gregory going down through the glass elevator but the glass elevator was out of service in the main entrance though, was that something?
28:41 Funniest part was when Freddy ran past you and went up the stairs lol and let monty get you.
Its a game loosely tied together, they should have done a lot of stuff differently like make the make smaller and add a lot more dialogue to mix the plot so if you find something early one but get a dialogue later it makes the previous thing make sense. I wish they added more of the original fnaf aspect or atleast mini games because most of the game in general is just running away from bots and collecting stuff
I want to cry now... I think that's the worst ending, right?
Fnaf 3 he's back
There is 6 different endings in that game
This is how many times Mark said "serious" 👇
Freddy getting revenge as he ran around following monty and going the opposite way
For a minute I was gonna murder mark if he didn’t release another video…
Can you just use the fazblast on moon or Freddie's scream?
There’s several endings
Freddy running right past desperate mark had me dead lmao
Every other fnaf game: Survive   Security Breach: *Survive and escape*
I think Scott Cawthon Wasn't quite done with the game, and that there Will be coming dlc's
Is Vanessa supposed to give the "why are you still here?" line that early?
FREDDY NONOOOOOOOOOOO
there is a secret in this game you can fight glitch trap he is crap
Why not just hide from Monty😂😂😂 But the Freddy go over Mark part really make my day XDDD
Oh, how the king's kingdom has crashed,  burned and fostered in feces
This game is so underwhelming
I love How aggressively Freddy runs
I would recommend, redoing the game but doing Monty's side. Because chica's upgrade is easier to do than Monty's. Because Monty is so broken to fight
Thank god the comments are full of Mark qoutes because nobody else watched this video to know what he has said/done in it
Freddy? Freddy!?!? FFFRRRREEEEEDDDDDDYYYYYYYY!?!?!?
my brother and i welcome you we wouldnt care if u found us
Can we appreciate how fast Lixian edits these
Something really odd is that in the Vanny ending for some reason Freddy had Monty's claws. I'm not sure if that's a continuity error or they just expected him to have the claws by then.
freddy frantically running around trying to find gregory has me on the floor it's so funny!!! he's trying his best!
14:28 i wonder how many dumb idiot artists are gonna animate this haha... **opens art program**       (just for the record, i didnt mean to insult any of you artists out there. it's supposed to be a self roast but i just KNOW that one of you out there is gonna get ticked off by me saying that, so consider this a pre-apology.)
The Vanny ending was anti-climatic!! Wtf!!!
everyone else during the bad ending: 😭😭😭😭 mark: 😐
That Monty chase scene is legit the most exciting and funny thing I've watched in this game so far lmaoo
Hey mark,you found 1 of 5 known ending…letting you know
This game seems like its made with a lot of love...  But yikes it seems poorly optimized and poorly planned. Haven't played it myself so can't judge to much but still.
15:35 guess thats what happens when you have no claws.
The game seems incredibly unfinished. I'm pretty sure the "Vanny" option is just a quick start for the QA testers to play the Vanny ending.
Mark
Honestly I think this game needed another month of development, not even just to iron out the bugs, but to fix those jank ending cutscenes. Like the whole game was reasonably high quality, and then ends like.. that?
Omg you have been playing this for the past decade
Mark you should play the princess arcade games you apparently get lore or something from those
Yeah the reason why there are so many un used things in this game is because some Twitter crybaby decided to cancel Scott because he donated to some republican thing, which I could care less about it. He makes cool games, idc who he supports, and that is the reason it is so unused.  Scott cawthon retired because he got death threats sent to him threatening him and his family. So don’t blame Scott. Blame the stupid generation and their tendency to cancel things they don’t like.
I'm sorry, this game is objectively really bad.
Hey guys i’m trying to find some old videos and wondering if anyone can help, it was a lot of videos that where short and it was about mark running from something and i remember the time was like glitched and stuff. I hope someone could please tell me what they where and where to find them.
"FREDDY YOU BITCH"
No shade but i cant tell how much of this game is disjointed and how much might be mark breezing past stuff? He plays games pretty fast so sometimes its hard to keep up haha
freddy just completely ignoring mark as he’s running and screaming for his life is the most ironic thing.
Mark i love you, but there was litrally no content in this video, but its okay ill forgive it coz your gorgeous
I wanna see mark try to defeat spring trap. But I wouldn't want him to go through all that trouble again
sudden comic book style in ending aside, damaged glam rock freddy calling you his super star is quite emotional
How did you know I haven’t clicked the links? Tbh that’s creepy. O_O
Will u fine us now or later
Pizza Hut cheese sticks
The last minutes were pure gold
the princess quest 3 arcade cabinet is in vanny's room.
Mark laughed when Freddy died and Freddy took his revenge by leaving him while he was being chased by Monty
Freddy also goes to the last point you called him. I dont think he goes to your location while your on the move
My god everything I have seen about this game just doesn’t feel like fnaf at all. On top of that, there seems to be such an inconsiderable lack of polish.
There are 7 endings
"Bye, have a beautiful time!"   -Freddy "the blindest mf to ever exist" Fazbear, 2021
the genuine frustration and fear in his screaming for freddy killed me
There is a way to kill Monty so who thinks mark should post part 8 and kill Monty 🪱
Can't help but wonder if this game was little bit inspired by dead rising, both set in large buildings and both have optional side quests, etc
Vanny kinda bad tho ngl
Lol
At this point, Mark is doing a pretty good job at testing for bugs in the game. And making it extremely public lol. I'm loving every second of this but the game still has some polishing to do
the moon guy legit sounds like ogre from skinny puppy
Bit weird final episode and he didn’t say anything about the game or about the evolution of fnaf after years and him finally playing fnaf again or saying he’ll make a follow up on the other endings it was the last episode to it and he just ended it like a normal video also to say he didn’t say anything it might be a bit of time till another fnaf game RIP cliffhanger
FREDDY ONLY GOES _WHERE_ YOU PRESSED Q, _NOT_ WHERE YOU ARE YOU SENT FREDDY TO 200 DIFFERENT PLACES AT THE SAME TIME
You need to complete the princess quest 1, 2 and 3 for the true ending.
I’m not a Fnaf fan in the slightest, I honestly only keep up with the lore because it’s interesting. I mean no harm when I say this, but this game seems like the Sonic Forces of the Fnaf games. Like it just feels like a fan service more than it does a proper game in the series.    But that’s just the vibe I’m getting from it
YOU BETTER SHOWCASE ALL OF THE ENDINGS GOOD SIR
Mark calling for freddy as freddy runs past him and monty is the funniest things I've seen all month
I hope he still continues to play since there is so much he he has missed!
freddy goes to where you called him running and calling him will only result in sadness
Im sorry, but watching freddy run right past him up the stairs while he was being chased by monty was hysterical 😂😂
Y’know, spamming the freddy button probably confuses him
love this
I wonder what the Vanny choice does If you gave Freddy Montys claws
now I see why this is a 30 minute video and not 50 🤣
I wasn't the first, I wasn't the last, But when I saw this I CAME LIGHTENING FAST
Press the leave option
I know this is supposed to be a horror game, but it just makes such good comedy, especially with that comic strip
Y’all are crying for Freddy, I’m doubling down for the true ending!
is it bad that I laughed the hardest while watching Mark run away from Monty while hysterically screaming "FREDDYYYYY" as Freddy just runs past him XD
Wait til he hears that he needs to go to Monty golf. 😂
atp i wish mark would stop playing the game bc it seems like he really doesnt like or understand it and waiting for a new episode only for half of it to be redoing the same tasks or getting lost is just unentertaining
18:00 Mark finishing and getting the ending
Legit crying rn Freddy 😭😭😭
Moondrop: Naughty boy Naughty boy  Me:are you mental?
I love how all the anamotronics can spawn behind you except Freddy. Freddy has to run the entire mile🤣🤣😭
You have to play all 3 princess quest arcade games to unlock a different ending when you disassemble vanny
when he says "He is done" Does that mean that he is not making a part 8? If so, I would like a confirmation please
Okay, good it seems like Mark will be going for the extra endings. Hope this means he gets one of the two awesome endings at some point.
I think my favorite part in this game is Markiplier screaming for Freddy while being chased by Monty! I laughed so hard! The joy of watching Mark suffering in this game. The best! XD
"FREADDEEEYYYYYY YOUU BASTAAARRRD" has to be the best thing I've heard today (29:10)
The comic scene was hilariously bad omg. Like even Mark couldn't hold himself back from laughing 😭
I hope mark gets to see all the endings
Mark: I am 100 meters away and rapidly approaching
Is the "Bad children" referring to Gregory?
Jumpscare list for those who don't like heart attacks:  3:27 (Mild, Moon Guy comes out to kill Freddy) 7:28 (Major, Offscreen Moon Guy kills Freddy) 10:45 (Major, Moon Guy Reveals Himself) 12:24 (Major, Moon Guy) 27:52 (Major, Security Bot attacks Mark from behind) 28:26 (Mild, Security Bot) 29:14 (Major, Monty Gets Mark cuz Freddy abandons Mark)  Let me know if I missed any!
If you had been quicker you would have more time to do everything
what nobody realizes is look at "disassembled" freddy they "disassembled" vanny.....who is a person in a suit....her insides are no longer insides gregory is a murderer
When did Freddy start to be able to see the vanny. There’s so much I feel like I’m missing!
If only he knew that there wasn’t much more story or cohesiveness to even explore. A few comic panel cutscenes and the lack of ability to save the collectibles he gathers. I love Steel Wool and FNAF but this game needed to cool a bit longer.
Hi
The episodes are getting shorter and shorter
i love how mark talks to freddy
The game not letting you save after 6 AM is absolute BS. At least it should give you a limited amount of saves a-la Resident Evil, not outright denying them to you, at least not by default, there's so many bugs and janky mechanics that trying to explore the rest of the game without saves will be an excersice in frustration and perhaps madness.
MEOW
freddy: helped mark the entire game  mark when freddy dies brutally : pure weezing
26:04 As someone who does their best to keep up with FNAF lore, if you aren’t on top of everything, this all feels really weird and confusing. And then even if are, things just get more confusing and qjdbjdhdhd
Vanny is mad fine ngl
It isn’t a Security Breach episode if Mark get stuck trying to complete a mission at least once
DO THE PRINCESS QUEST STUFF
27:53 That entire Monty chase scene at the end is definitely my favourite moment of this series, next to Freddy popping out of existence during the lift
Mark is trying SO HARD not to talk shit about  this game... I can see it in his face
"Get me in you" is probably the most romantic thing I've ever heard in my life.
This game seems... not great
Mark I miss inscription
I love roxy as a concept, like humans made a robot programed to be depressed
Pick up the head in roxy raceway to re-enable saves
this game honestly didnt even feel like a fnaf game at all. It doesnt seem to be linked to the main game at all story wise. it feels like a spin off .
I quite like the comic endings, but I understand why people think they’re jarring
Watching this at midnight was not the smartest decision but it also was so I’m not going to complain
Literally just ended part 6 and I went to my home page and then I see 15 minutes ago he posted 7. Luck was on my side. thank you
I'm pretty sure we're supposed to feel sad over Freddys death and not laugh like mark did lol
gaMer gaming
18:14 pterodactyl noises
vanny lookin thicc
Mark: “Can I save now, please?”  Freddy: *happy dad noises*
I can't wait for part 20 when he finishes the game; wonder how much he makes per video to make it worth stretching the content out that long. The game is fun, but I don't think it's 10-parts, 5+hours fun unless you factor in making hundreds of thousands of dollars while doing it.
you’re done? as in with the game completely? wow..
How did he knew I was ealry
A-
what was the point of the security badges? and the other exits? and what was the point of going into the daycare in the first place? it all seems like filler that doesn't have any reason.
Please finish this 🥺
Yep I’m pretty serious
Markplier bots reveal yourselves here:
I hope you find me. i want your autograph
Ngl I feel like spamming the call button might be messing up Freddy and maybe make him restart his arrival. Also I'm pretty sure he also runs straight to where you originally pushed the button regardless of how many times you press it after the first push.
The reason for the comic end, is actually like the actual comic books abt fnaf
this game is a fucking mess lmao
This episode needs to be animated
Is Bonnie in this game at all? Also, are there mini games that you can play?
@Markiplier please  I know I know the pain But persevere, it pays off in such a satisfying way if you just got the extra mile
please part 8 soon i cant wait for a part 8.
11:40 IT TOLD YOU TO LEAVE AND THAT THE CHARGING STATIONS ARE NOT WORKING. WHY DONT YOU READ
hey markimoo there are different endings just a headsup!
This dude thinks spamming it will get freddy to teleport, like no that just makes him have to go to the nearest teleport spot and run from there. Mark you are the problem.
We will all be here before the weird fan art and animations…I hope you alls are with me..
My mom thinks you live here since I play all your videos and she hears your lovely screams
Vanny is vanessa, it was told in the vr game
Freddy: *RUNS LIKE YOU DID SOMETHIN TO HIS MOM* me: ........ M   E   N   A   N   C   I   N   I   G
Man this is your absolute worst five nights at Freddie's play through ever
u better do more endings!!
its not a markiplier fnaf video without a "suffering compilation"
i lost it when freddy kept running away from mark when he was getting chased by monty LMAOO
Freddy: literally dies Mark: *wheeze*
Mark: FREDDY! FREDDY!  Freddy: nope, see you later  Me: laughs super hard LOL
Tbh, that Freddy death was laughably awfully written, wth
Hey Mark, you do know there’s 6 endings, right?
There should be an extra mode, so that the player can experience what the pizzaplex is like during the day. It sounds stupid, sure, but the place is huge, and there is a lot to look at.
How are there more and more hate bots in the comment sections every time mark uploads a new security breach Come on man it’s been a week and I ain’t never seen more bots in one comment section before
do a fnaf tier list. (also include fnaf fan games)
I hope mark plays every ending
I like how Mark never fails to say hi to those Yellow sign bots whenever they look at him like that.
willl there be a part 8?
What the HECK is that disjointed ending???????? Omg????????
God 28:42 killed me. The panic and just sprinting right past
Mark: Here's links. Click on them or I'll find you🙃  Me: Well... Guess you're about to spend a LOT of time at Walmart homie 😏  Also, Mark screaming for Freddie... It has me dying💀🤣
Bro
I still don’t understand where the heck  Vanessa came from and what her motivation is. Her behavior and dialogue seemed to me like her goal was trying to maintain a terrible reputation of the establishment by corrupting the animatronics and purposely wiring them to be violent. The bad intention idea is backed up by the note Mark found a couple episodes ago about the company warning not to hire Vanessa.
Mark may be a bit of a dork, but the amount of trouble he has at certain points seems to be the fault of the game. It has some structural issues... Unfortunately.
Mark: *laughs at Freddy dying*  Freddy, when Mark needs his help later: Oh oops I just ran past you. Can't imagine why I did that, Superstar.
Not being able to save after 6 am in my opinion is like.. The worst idea ever
28:42  Freddy running past Gregory on the stairs  while mark was screaming his name was so funny
Do it come find me I wanna give you a hug
Did they run out of budget for the last animation that’s the funniest way of explaining the comic strips
This is the most confusing episode i've ever seen
Whyd I cry at the first ending.
So much of Mark's "It feels like this is here for no reason, did they run out of budget?" is areas that are for the story paths he didn't choose, or the investigation he isn't doing because he's not paying attention to the things he reads in the messages.
Watching this at work
30:05 Me: *Not clicking on the links in the description Mark: "I'm 100 yard away from your location and rapidly approaching"
MARK I THINK YOU NEED TO BE LEVEL 10 OR FINNISH ALL THE MISSION TO GET VANESAS GIFT AND HAVE A BETTER ENDING JUST FINNISH IT ALL AIGHT!!
I can't wait for him to do the other endings
NOT ME CRYING OVER FREDDY
Mark you gotta get other upgrades before the Roxy eyes upgrade, because it's Roxy eye upgrade that shuts off charge stations, and save stations, and activates the end game so you can't explore, save, and finish all options, upgrades, endings Brother
What exactly is Vanny’s role in this? I know it’s a secret ending but it just seems really random, is she connected to Vanessa or something?
Theory=security breach takes place before fnaf 2 and the whole "welcome back" Is welcoming u back after security breach
lessss gooooooooo
This game is not polished at all. I was worried about this when it was announced a bigger studio was going to be doing the game. The story is broken and all over the place. At the end Gregory mentions ‘disappearances’ like it’s a MAJOR plot point but I haven’t heard anything about them during the many videos ive watched from several youtubers. To be fair I haven’t seen any other endings yet, but an ending shouldn’t mention it at all if it’s not a running narrative THROUGHOUT the game. I know this is a FNAF game and most of the story is hidden, but this is very different. This is bad storytelling.
AS SOON AS I SAW HE FINALLY UPLOADED THIS VIDEO I WAS SCREAMINGGGGGGGGGG SJHDJSJHDJSBJBJSKSJKJSHJSKHKBKB
LMAO I AM EARLY HOW U KNOW
I just started to watch this and I already know this is the last part because its only 30 mins
Can anyone explain to me why is Markiplier isn't coloring his hair again ???  Just like jack
I lost my shit when Freddy ran past mark and mark just screamed
lol. great video!
I saw this at the perfect moment , 69k likes LOL!
28:33 Mark laughed at Freddie getting demolished  It was only fair that Freddie gets a little reimbursement
this game is completely broken sweet jesus
There is a secret ending mark
no Mark, please don't quit, you've only got 1 of the 6 known endings and you still have 2 more boss fights to do, you're basically only halfway through the game.
That ending was absolutely amazing, especially when Freddy walked by on the stairs.
Mark: I will come find you Me: Well, I better go hide between the two washing machine       For those who didn't get the joke, rewatch part 2 of this series.
I can honestly say this is why I like Scott for this game. It’s the details that’s really get me. Ever since five nights at Freddy’s one he always tries to focus on their eyes especially how they just light up in the dark. I don’t know whenever Markiplier looks at Freddy and he’s just staring at you in the dark with his glowing eyes, it just gives me the chills every time
XD
17:49 Sadge
There is a total of 7 endings.
That ending was fucking horrifying!  They seriously thought "ya know what?  Let's have an ending where a child has a woman ripped limb from limb!" & someone said "Genius!"
There's supposed to be like 6 endings for this and I haven't seen all of them yet
I don’t think I’ve ever heard markiplier scream so high in my life than the moment he was calling “FREDDY!!” In this. HAHAHA
That ending was absolutely amazing, especially when Freddy walked by on the stairs.
that ending was so anti-climactic
Ah yes, Freddy’s death, a true humorous classic
POTENTIAL SPOILER WARNING: I'll try and keep this comment spoiler free as possible but if anyone wants more info on the endings and some hints on how to get them keep reading.  So on the ending(s) of this game, yes plural we've seen one of them here with Mark but there's like 6 not including any potential new ones when they add DLC down the line and u can kinda tell how close they are to the intended true(canon) ending for this game based upon how many stars they show at the end out of 3 (I think and of which Mark got the 2 star ending). There's 3 others u can get at the point Mark is at, one "bad" ending, a neutral ending accessed from a different leaving spot not the front doors and what I think is the true/canon ending which Mark was close to but he missed 3 specific interactable items that explain more the lore for this game and how we got to this point in the FazUniverse. The other two require u to stay and complete the Monty missions to be able to access the right areas and get the required items for.  Overall there are some bugs with the game for sure but I mostly liked what they did and where they might look to go for future installments and DLC
The game 100% feels like it could've been done better and more user friendly, because half the time mark had to try and remember what he was told to do and couldn't look it up :/
I love the fact mark is calling Freddy bastard and laughing at him dying but calling them besides, pure friendship
I don't know if Mark will see this but there is a secret area too get the true ending. You have to go down a old elevator but you will need the Monty claws upgrade. If I were you I would watch I video or two to at least figure out were the elevator is. Good luck
you were supposed to get the Monty upgrade before roxy, the game glitched
Good news! It is almost a cock
I guessed wrong a few episodes back I though the kid was not human interesting
I just love these videos
Markiplier: Watches Freddy power off Also Markiplier: “Did they run out of budget for that last animation-“ ( 18:09 )
Freddy said oh Monty is chasing you no I’m good later superstar✌️
Kids cried at Titanic  Men cried at Freddy's death
i honestly want a free play mode on this game. no time constraints, no running, just exploring, because mark was right- there’s a lot of areas that barely get utilized, if they do at all. but judging by how much work they put into the endings that’s not coming anytime soon 💀
Just the way he freaks out when Freddy passed by him while getting chased by Monty is priceless.  xD
Which else isn’t clicking the links so they can meet Markiplier in person
I can’t wait for matpat to absolutely suck this game dry of its lore
😀
Freddy was already broken, when I was playing I managed to glitch him into the fazer blast area. It was a bad idea saying I’d hear loud stomping get scared then notice it was just Freddy trying to glitch out of the said area.
I doubt that they ran out of budget for the Vanny ending...more like they didn't want to animate robots disassembling a human body.
I’m early and good job Markiplier I love your Videos so much
Mark: *demonic screeches* “FREDDYYYYYYY!!!! AHHHHHHHHHH FREDDDDYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!”   Freddy: *runs past* “nope”
Mark is trying so hard to not directly say that he doesn't enjoy parts of this game. Dunno if you're reading this, but it's alright, man. I understand.
The game’s not over for the King of Five Nights at Freddy’s yet! Keep up the great content!
Mark: *Calls Freddy near the broken door*  Freddy: "Fuck this shit, I'm out!" (Alright then!)
Poggers
I think your able to save now-_-
Mark is really behind other youtubers…  But did other youtubers notice the golden plushies?  Did they think about the *lore?*
So who is gonna tell mark that Freddy will only be summoned at the last known location where he'd pushed the call button, anyone?
vanny was the white rabbit the fans were chasing
And so it continues
ii love this man😂😂
Mark if you read this I have a feeling it might be due to Scott leaving? I know the game was in development when he decided to leave that might of caused the story to change a bit
If you get a robot head at roxy raceway you can save.
28:45 the absolute fear coming out of mark right then and there 😭😭😭
I can't wait for mark to spend all of this time to get the monty upgrade just to do the vanny option again and for it to be the exact same thing
literally the outro is a gang fight they're ganging up on freddy
he said what happend 10 thousand times
Just bought my first piece of Cloak merch today!
So here's what I think: In my opinion, this game is still in early access... Mainly due to the fact that the game is still full of bugs, unfinished scenes, there isn't enough Lore for the dedicated FNAF fans to use... The presents that you get don't really build a story of the game nor how the Pizzaplex came to be, Vanny (like Mark said) feels like too much of a red herring and I agree because she feels like a half-baked excuse for a "final boss" style character... Plus the game literally tells you that it's her that's behind it all rather than letting the players figure it out, the pacing and timing is AWFUL, there are too many security bots roaming around and you can see Mark get visibly frustrated by them towards the end of the game, the tutorial is a little over bearing when it too frequently reminds you of stuff you already know how to do (for example when you're in the protective cylinder, the narrator already tells you what you have to do, so why does the game tell you it again??), Freddy runs out of power too quickly towards the late game (unless you get a battery upgrade) and there is no indication that Freddy will kill you if you don't recharge him once you fit him with an upgrade.... All around, even though the game looks amazing and some of the sequences are legitimately terrifying I can't help feeling that the game is a pretty big disappointment
Mark really needs to stop trying to brute force this game holy crap
This game is very unpolished. It seems very fun, but I think they should've waited and worked on it more, then release it.
Stop spamming Q please.
Lmao so far Mark and penguinz0 aka Charlie. BOTH said "is the game is on a budget" or "they don't have enough budget for the endings?" Cuz come on. The endings could've been better than some comic books looking. Either the devs don't have budget left. Or REALLY in a hurry to be done.
1 hour eraly
.... Smh personally didn't enjoy  these endings
since when has a fnaf game ever had a cohesive story? you've always had to dig deep into fnaf games to find a semblance of "story".
Now for the other endings and secrets
What a buggy game. Jeez.
Mark, with Freddy's new eyes, you can find Vanny's audio logs!
I haven’t played it myself, so I could be very wrong (and you may have already noticed or maybe won’t even see this, who knows😂) but I’m pretty sure with the pathing of Freddy, he’s been coded to go to the spot you called him to. I.E. if you call him, then start running 20 feet away, whenever he shows up, he’ll be 20 feet behind you at the same spot that you summoned him. Not really sure but it may be useful 🤷🏻‍♂️
actually the way  it is summoned does not affect the behavior, clicking to call freddy makes him to take a path, once he is moving, if you call him again he WILL do another pathing, so he will be stuck in a pathing loop until you either stop calling or finds you as the same time you click over him AND he finishes one of the many paths you made him take.
freddy u bich! FREDDDAAAYYYY! hahahahaha
I get Freddy dying is supposed to be sad but....it was really too abrupt of a jump to the cutscene...and the whole sequence is jarring back and forth like it was skipping parts or something. Could have been neat but feels a little too hurried.
The Disassemble vanny think kinda reminds me of Jakob in DUSK
another great episode
I am sad it’s over
Mark:FREDDYYYY!!FREDDYYYY!!!!!GET ME IN GET ME IN!!!  freddy:*runs past mark* Mark:YOU BIIITCCCHHHH!! FREDDDEEEYY!!!
I love how if you stay then the entire pizza place is just free roam it is pretty much an open world first person horror game and i love it
nah bc we gotta see you do the secret endings.
jumpscares  3:28 moon says "its past ur bedtime"  3:33 moon jumpscared scream 6:01 moon says "its past ur bedtime" 7:29 mark opens door and jumpscare sound effect plays 10:46 moon jumpscare 12:24 moon jumpscare 16:04 very minor roxy scare 27:53 security bot scare 28:28 security bot scare 29:15 monty jumpscare
Their are more than two endings and... The difficulty getting them varies by little, have a good time getting ALL endings. also remember you can't save never again.
when freddy just ran by mark while getting chased by monty i lost it😭
18:02 Please, someone help Mark, someone just stole his voicebox again
they put 99% of the budget into the graphics and 1% for everything else
28:02 someone put Yakety Sax from this moment til he gets jumpscared
"Good news! It is almost a c*ck!"      h w h a t
I wish he could get all the endings
This whole thing is Freddy playing around with a kid at the pizzaplex for his birthday…this is the wholesome thing right
Disappointing that you can't save at 6:00 AM hopefully they change that
Oh, no... That comic ending... That's unacceptable, my god
had just finished watching part 6 and I was hoping for another part then BAM look at my recommended page and there i is, part 7 streamed 57 mins ago. May be late but I'm now happy heh.
I don't know if I've ever heard Mark scream in that high of an octave in his entire youtube career. Freddy just running right past him just about killed me! Freddy decided to ghost Mark after seeing the mess he was in!
I like how the intro was a ytp short lol
Mark almost crying at Freddy's death. Me crying: Me to mark, me to.
Mark screaming desperately for Freddy is so funny  Like before you would scream in fear of him and now you are screaming for him to save you
the fact that Freddy ran straight past Mark AND Monty just made me laugh so hard lmao

Mark buddy the whole Freddy thing works where you pressed the button
Freddy: *gets eye upgrades*  5 minutes later   Markiplier: *I can't see anything*
0:00: You know I wouldn't miss it for the world, Mark. Came here as soon as possible. 😁
IMO, this game is awful. It doesn’t need to exist. A lot of it doesn’t really make sense either. Not to mention it doesn’t feel like a fnaf game
jumpscares: 3:33 (minor), 7:28/9, 10:45, 12:23, 27:53, 28:26, 29:14
isnt there like 6 or 7 endings?
Mark *updates*  Me 👁️👄👁️🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♀️
The game really does look unfinished
Can’t lie I’m glad you suffered trough this game instead of me. I’m glad I could watch it and skip trough all the bad/boring stuff. Keep up the amazing work 👌
THIS WAS HILARIOUS, Thank you Mark!
the left click for chica’s voice box stun will never be used will it 😭😭
This game really started promisingly, got better, got a bit rocky but still good, and then immediately lost all budget and coherence  10/10
This Monty Freddy chase part is so freaking funny. Please someone animate this.
glitched freddy running past monty and waiting his turn had me crying lol
Dislike
Freddy: dying horribly  Mark: “Did they run out of budget?”
FREDDY
28:38 made me laugh so hard
Poor mark
I love when Mark narrates himself suffering it's a spark of comical genius
Mark if you go near the salad and sides there is a gift box that has a Freddy battery upgrade you should be able to see it with the roxy upgrade
28:40
8:52 where i left off
There’s the original FNAF pizzaplex hidden somewhere inside the building witch contains the original Animatronics and the secret ending so Mark if you read do.
Im so lucky i just watched all of the episodes at once 🤣 and this one came out almost as soon as I finished pt6
PLEASE SAVE LITTLE KITTY GUY
I understand the game doesn't have a good sense in telling you whats next and what to do but I feel like Mark misses all these things because he is speeding through the game. There were a lot of things that even the game told him to do and he completely throws it out the window. Free range games tend to exist so you can explore but Mark didn't do any exploring, I hope he finds more stuff in the next video cause I don't want to see other people play this game until Mark finishes and it just feels like nothing has happened at all. Also I'm a huge fan of comic endings and I loved it even if Mark didn't. On another note, Mark updating this every day has been so much fun. Its all I look forward to after work.
BASED!!!!
Mark is definitely not going to see this, but if anyone wants to be able to save after 6 AM (about to put down a spoiler): Pick up the Driver Assist bot head from Roxy Racewat again and this sets the time to 5 :15. The time changing doesn't break the game in any way and you can still get any of the endings after doing so.
Just a hint!!! Try playing and beating all 3 Princess Quest games!! One was in Vanny’s room and the other was in the hallway at the fazcade, I’ll leave you to find the third one!
This game is in unacceptable condition
the game was so rushed because of fans and just overall demand so they rushed everything, i hope to see more fixes and usage in different areas of the game.
What happened
Saw this on 8-Bit Ryan's playthrough, but if you go back to Roxy Raceway after choosing to stay, there's another staff bot head you can pick up and for some reason it allows you to save again(probably a bug). Could have been patched, or I could be wrong, but it's just a friendly tip. 👍
you gonna play more and find the true ending?
AI Path finding in a nutshell and it makes it better with Mark having an existential crisis of Freddy not coming to mark 5:02
Hey there. Yes, you. I know you’re tired of everything being thrown at you, sometimes without warning. You are trying your best to keep your head above water. Remember to take some deep breaths, drink some water, and try to get some rest. Life won’t be this way forever. You will get to where you want to be. It all starts with getting rest. I love you, have a nice night.
A lot of this game has nonsensical design. The best segment by far has to be the Endoskeleton red light green light segment. That sequence is a good example of what the other sequences needed to be like in this game. The endoskeleton scene was very streamlined and made a lot of the mechanics and goals clear. It was Point A to Point B; the main challenge being make sure the endos don't get too close to you, that's it. I feel like a lot of the other sequences need to be fine tuned so that there aren't just a bunch of security bots constantly going off, spawning in other animatronics when they aren't necessary. The Mega Music Man would've been a much better sequence if the staff bots weren't there. The bugs don't help heh
This game feels unfinished. Glitches that make you need to redo large sections and poor game design that makes it too difficult to know where or what to do. It feels very repetitive and unpolished and the ending mark got is so poor. Very disappointed in the game overall tbh
My gosh mark screaming Freddy is the funniest thing ever
My opinion on this FNAF game: the buggiest, non-climatic ending, underdeveloped game yet. So many bugs, the story started well but it went downhill, the end is just so unsatisfying, the story and gameplay: there could be so much more like utilizing other areas, having the chance to kill Monty (I know there is like a way to do it, but the fact that it's an 'extra' thing after 6am is such a chore), reintroducing old characters (to actually try to hunt and kill Gregory in certain areas) such as Bonnie, boss battles with the animatronics would be soo fun, or heck even having Freddy malfunctioning and turn against Gregory would be very interesting. Visuals are off the bat: just fucking amazing, but bugs and a bland story (watery lore, it ain't thicc enough lmao) really kills the charm and it's so fucking sad :((((( wdyt?
I think Freddy running right past Mark to go to the previous location he called him at was hilarious
Why are thw fnaf videos getting less and less time in eaaaaacccchhhh
Super annoying play through..
I want to see marks reaction to the other endings
It just came out yay
Imagine if you could run away from a killer and many of her sbire but not force a freaking door or jump over a single fence
I did not know marks voice could go that high🤣🤣 28:45
Maybe you shouldnt do the ocular thing yet? Idk, but monty can be destroyed so there is some content you missed definitely! AND you're missing this camera thing and hidden CDs about Vanessa.
There are multiple endings mark. Vanny was one of the 2 star endings
Maybe if you stopped yelling at Freddy like that he’d be more obligated to save you 🤧
30:05 uhm... thats actually fine  i need friends...
Yo
VANNY FUCKING KILLED MY DAD
[Minor spoiler, I guess?]     Personally, after watching Dawko's entire playthrough, I think that having one of the endings with a full cinematic and the others just being 2d animated could be an artistic choice to differentiate the true ending from the alternative, non-canon endings. Perhaps it wasn't the best choice or maybe I'm totally wrong, but that's how I interpret why the endings are like that.
Freddy: happy guy who does everything markiplier says all the time with “way to go, superstar!”   Markiplier when Freddy doesn’t listen once or twice (voice goes up five and a half octaves) FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!! Aaaaaaaagh!! FREDDYYYY!!!!   Freddy: rolls eyes electronically   Mark: still screaming hysterically  Also Mark: dies
Love this and love you mark
Damn I was about to fall asleep I'm so tired but now I have to watch this
FYI the "True" ending is that we save Vanessa by completing the princess quest games which releases glitch traps control over her, Freddy burns down the building but something happens that I can't remember which causes Freddy to just be a head and then Freddy and Gregory reach the doors and Vanessa is there. In the final credits part of the game, Vanessa, Freddy's head and Gregory are looking at a sunset eating ice cream. So it seems that because Gregory is an orphan, Vanessa adopts him and the 3 of them live happily but knowing FNaF, if this isn't the final game, something bad will happen.
Nobody: Surgeons part way through the gender change: 0:05
Apparently Fazbear Entertainment upgraded Freddy by hooking up his direction-finding functions to Google Maps.
There is a disc at the front of stage
MARK!!! FINISH INSCRYPTION!!
YAY
It's not the end there are 6 endings have fun getting to them
This game is a trip. Definitely needed more time in the oven if you know what i mean lmao. Hot garbage 3/10 would recommend
*monty chasing mark*  mark: FREDDY!! WHERE ARE YOUU?!! *freddy runs past mark* mark: FREDDY GET BACK HERE!!
freddy comes to the point where you call for him so if you keep moving around you won't be able to catch up with him. or if you keep calling him you reset everything every time so he takes longer to get to you.
They'd better patch this game up a hell of a lot to fix all the bugs. plotholes, and other various problems with the story and gameplay. The game as it is isn't completely ready
IM just thinking what Amy is thinking😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
i really hate how unpolished this game is
It's half past midnight and practically today is christmas but fuck security breach is more urgent than sleep
This game annoys me so much like it existing like sure… waiting for this game sucked, but I expected great things with the time they had 😑
ABABABABABBAAB ENDINGS
There are 6 different endings markimoo!!!!
I think that if you went to monty golf to get the claws and did that then he could fight?
OMG I DIED 28:40 💀🤣Mark hoping and begging for Freddy to come so he can get in him, see's him, has a spark of hope, then frantically screams "FREDDY!!! FREDDY!!!" as he watches Freddy run right past him up the stairs, and then past Monty LOOOL!! 🤣😂
I think freddy left you because you laughed at his death
Please mark, we need more! best regards a fan.
quality content mwa
Cool
freddy it’s tripping off acid with these new eyes
FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!
no because... what was up with that vanny ending 😭😭
When tf did missing children get introduced to this game. Did I miss something? Did they cut it out of the game? I think we’re missing some cutscenes and other stuff.   I think they just ran out of money tbh   Also (spoiler alert) there are a good ending to the vanny ending which has something to do with the princess mini game
Don't get me wrong, this game looks good, but it looks like a ton isn't going for it on bugs and the story. Do you think Scott leaving caused any of this or would this have turned out the same way with Scott? Like would he have delayed the game and make it fit more together? Honestly don't know how he works in a work place
I know people are aggressively defending this game, but my god are the functions need major work and the game is so choke full of bugs I cannot believe they released it. So tired of games being bad on release, please just hold them back and make something good. Game could've had complaints for being held back, but released as a good product that people would appreciate in the future, now it will forever just be a bad game. The bar is so low and I hope in the future companies stop releasing unfinished games, but people are going to continue to excuse it and give them money so they're going to continue to do it.
Damn Freddy was all like nope LOL 😂😂
Why Vanny thicc tho
Freddy running right past you as monty chased you down was the highlight of my evening 😂 FREEEDDDYYY!!!!
Like Mark said... the environment and textures are great, but holy fuck this game is bad.
Why such a short video today 😭
So are you going to do all the endings
19:47 lmao the text on the newspaper is hilarious
Security Breach isn’t a bad game but it really was too ambitious in my opinion. I can definitely see the love and ambition put into it by such a small team, but they really should’ve focused more on the story and pacing in the game.   I also really want to hear what Scott has to say if he ever will, because I don’t think he would’ve been satisfied with Security Breach in the state it was released in but that’s just my two cents.
Mark: FREDDY, HELP ME !!!  Freddy: Nope
Omg the final part had me dead
Some endings are animated and not comics
if you go to the cargo dock there is exit you can take that is one of the good endings
Maybe if you went to the main stage now, there would be something there
MARK YOU CAN REACTIVATE THE SAVE STATIONS BY GOING BACK INTO ROXY RACEWAY AND PICKING UP THE BROKEN DRIVER ASSIST HEAD ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
I feel like there's A LOT missing from this game, the pacing is just weird and the cutscenes just come out of no where it really takes away from the game.  Not to mention the BUGS, I don't think it should've been released with this many bugs :/
Did I miss something last episode? Confused as to why he has the Roxy eyes.
To be honest this entire Pizzaplex thing seems like HELA FUN MAN it’s huuuuge
There are actually multiple endings to this game mark
okay i get it Monty was chasing you, but if you dont keep moving and keep pressing Q the Freddy thing is not gonna work like you want Mark, he goes to the spot where you last pressed the button, not to where you currently are
Oh Mark, you innocent Sol, have fun digging into insanity with this one.
It's crazy to think Mark allowed the game to happen and flourish with his videos.
Those Yellow Caution Bots are the Best parts of this Series so far. I'd love a compilation of those moments once Mark uncover's the real truth of the Pizzeria.
How do you submit for caption btw, would be awesome to have a jumpscare preparation caption for the faint of hearts
Pt.8?
I’m 98% sure they ran out of time/budget for the endings
E
I hope mark gets the crazy plot twisting ending, ifykyk
the way he was absolutely right ab the red "hare"-ing
Yo Markiplier, look for those arcade machines that say princess quest on them. you can actually play those games!
I like to think that Gregory is a distant relative of the Joestars, and Freddy is his Stand.
In case you're wondering, it's possible to save by glitching the game into thinking it's not 6 AM yet. This will make getting the harder to get endings easier.
15:18 Why is Vanny thicc af tho?
Try bringing Freddy to the closed curtains in Bonnie bowl
40% of this video is death
I’m early for once let’s go🥳👻 likeif your early 👍🏼
The bad ending the good ending and the secret ending
Updated Jumpscare Counter- Part 7 Chica: 12 Moon: 7 (3:34, 7:30, 10:45, 12:24) Mini Music Man: 3 Vanny: 2 Freddy: 2 Golden Freddy: 3 Unknown Endos: 2 DJ Music Man: 1 Monty: 2 (29:14) Roxy: 4 Security bots(Cont. from Part 6): 15 (27:54, 28:27)
They really need to make the call freddy button works better
More like Freddy FazBorg, amirite?
So is there coming a part 8?
Mark, there's several endings in this game and that ending you encountered is one of them...
Please do the true ending
Mark screaming for Freddy was amazing 😂😂
I don’t know if they patched it out yet, but if you pick up the robot head in Roxy Raceway, you will be able to save again.
"So many of these areas seem to go unutilized" You've played about a third of the content, Mark.
I found out that you can play Princess quest arcade
Mark: “Freddy u in the theatre?”   Freddy: *runs past and into the wall* pff no
please this episode was so funny the last couple of minutes I love it
Mark can either be a really smart person or a really stupid person but when he plays FNAF it's both at once
Mark there's a glitch where you pick up the bot head again at roxy raceway which Will allow you to save the game
hey mark, remember, you gave freddy chicas voice box? it can stun animitronics, also, you were the one breaking freddy, he is set to come to the specific location were you pushed the summon button, if you keep running around and mashing the summon button, you are resetting the location were freddy is going to come to EVERY time you push the button, ensuring that freddy is CONSTANTLY trying to go to the location YOU marked. on top of that he is suppose to come from the charging stations so any rout to and from one will probably were he is, and when he does arrive in the area you keep mashing the button, making the pathfinding get screwed up even further, basically the game doesn't want you to button mash
so you got the "kill vanny ending"
Early
There are 4 ending mark
“The recharge stations are offline.”  Mark: **immediately tries to go in a recharge station**
There are hidden discs around the map! You have to be in Freddy to find them!
Freddy waiting his turn to go down the stairs is so polite, even if it means the death of his friend.
there are 6 ending and i love the most ending was fighting afton/springtrap in underground
there’s like 6 endings. Vanessa is vanny and she is possessed by glitch trap (william afron) he wanted vanny to do his bidding and apparently there are secret tapes around the map that are actually vanessa therapy session and she’s in therapy because of a custody battle that led her mom to suicide apparently. You could’ve saved vannessa by playing all the princess games that’s the good ending, if you chose to leave then you would end up seeing gregory in a box with the missing children newspaper and vanny skipping down the corner about to murder. Another ending is you kill glitchtrap but you need all upgrades. There’s an ending we’re freddy pushes vanny off the roof and boom she dead and reveals its vanessa, and also you completely missed the full battery upgrade by freddy’s pizza
Mark high pitched screaming “FREDDDYYYYY” had me dying 😂
The most shocking part of the game is that there are QA Testers listed in the credits.
Near the end I thought mark would scream “FREDDY YOU UNRELIABLE BITCH”😂😂😂
Visually this game is extremely beautiful but the story and pasting is just.... They missed a lot of in between stuff. Even for fnaf there's too much unanswered. We actually don't even know what's going on through the entire game. We don't know why we are there, why are we being attacked, why is freddy friendly. Also this ending with vanny???? WHAT IS THAT. It happened too fast.  Also I feel like this whole open world wasn't the best idea. It would be much better if it was separated by parts. 1. Because of those weird teleportations of animatronics. 2. You can easily get lost, and let's be honest the game isn't helping us navigate at all. I also think the game relied a bit too much on those security bots and it was actually hard to get scared since most of the time you were just confused. There are not even that many hints to point out what are we even doing there and what happened to Freddy at the beginning.  I don't really know what to think of this game. The artists, people who modelled and designed the whole place did an amazing job, but the story writers and programmers messed up. Some parts were extremely fun but others were just boring and out of place. The game could use a lot more polishing.
They spent the budget on Afton
you need all the upgrades then go to Roxy's raceway to go down the elevator to get the true ending
im finna cry over an animatronic
Deadass crying
Mark making fun of the art when he saw the first ending kinda made me sad. I thought it was a nice stylistic choice and someone probably worked really hard to make that art look nice. I don't get why people frown upon stuff like that. Why do all cutscenes have to be in the same models as the game? Why can't we have some good old fashioned comic panels?
I couldn’t stop laughing when Mark said to Freddy to not wait his turn lol
Freddy has always gone to the area where you first hit the button. He doesn't go to you. You plant a summon flag and he goes to them in order. So the more you spam, the slower he is to arrive.
*WHAT HAPPENED*  *What happened?!*  *WhAt HaPpEneD*  *wHaT hApPeNed*
Mark. remember when you first learned how to print a document and you were warned not to click print more than once because the printer would just store and then execute all of those inputs? what do you think happens when you call for Freddy a thousand times in a row?
Mark: "FREDDY!" Freddy: Runs past him Also Freddy: "That's what you get for laughing at my death you bas-"
I loved how Freddy just ran right past him.
Hint: leaving the pizzaplex gives the bad ending, and there other secret endings (Afton)
I really wanna buy and play this game but while watching Mark's and Dawkos playthrough the game  is just riddled with bugs and glitches And every other segment has major lag drop
Tutorial: "Recharge stations don't work anymore" Mark: WHY DOESN'T THIS RECHARGE STATION WORK?
sooo you're just gonna leave it at half an episode? man i've been waiting all day for this :(
There are many things left in the game Mark, I hope you find them all.
Bro Monty chasing mark while Freddy is running around like a headless chicken is so hilarious
I love that everyone that finishes this game is saying the same about that this can’t be the end :DDD
I'm suprised he didnt get the secret audios and secret room
You can glitch the game by picking up a broken head that lets you save after the staying choice
Mark: “Fredday! *fredday! FREDDAY NOT THAT WAY!”*
This sure was a confusing episode
Mark: *stays* Monty: and I took that personally.
yay a new ep
click the link or i will find you. Promise?
Jumped for joy when I saw this notification
You just want to milk it dry dont you?
The ending was my favorite part😂
that ending was so fucking funny
12:41 I think I hear that its a bug so you can't access it until they patch it
FFFFRRREEEEEEDDDDDYYYYY!!!!!!!!!
Mark in the area were you press the button to kill vanny there's an arcade machine you can play it's an ending
Actually mark I think at 7:30 you got caught by Monty or Roxy as you walked the long way round where their original animation path following of Roxy and Monty chase scene you at the start of the game , reason why Roxy says "are you lost" as if their models are still there but invisible something that needs patching?
Freddy usually seems to go to wherever you FIRST call him. Not where you are currently running around. It's like it's a specific placement on the map. When you first press it, he goes to that location and ignores you currently calling him, gets to that first spot, AND THEN moves to wherever you pressed once he got to his first destination. AKA Freddy can't understand or follow when you are spamming him until he reaches his target. This could be why he didn't take the smarter route to get to Gregory by taking a different staircase because I think in his silly robot mind, he was on the correct side of where he got the signal. This is just what I am seeing in multiple gameplays -__-
“FREEDDDYYYYYY”
Why is Freddy so human that I’m sad he’s dead ;-; I SHOULDNT BE SAD ABOUT A FICTIONAL DEATH-
Everyone: “How many times do you want to repeat ‘Are you serious’ word?”  Markiplier: “Yes”
yeaaa
watching freddy run up the stairs past mark and monty was the highlight of my day
such a waste of a fnaf game
Mark: calls for Freddy incessantly  Freddy: enters a completely different door and runs away from Mark
So, I went ahead and checked out the endings yesterday after watching Mark's video from yesterday because it was pretty obvious this was going to be the end and.. I don't even know where to start. I'm just so incredibly disappointed by this game. What's good about it? The design is cool. The open world is cool. The new mechanics are neat. And that's about it. Where did everything go that the community loves about the FNAF games? Where is the lore? Where is the horror? Where is the suspense in the difficulty?.. and not just constant staff bot jump scares that getting entirely way too annoying. The endings are just... ridiculously mind-blowing. I have more than enough questions for those, but to keep away from spoilers I'll just ask the same question - Did you just... run out of budget, or something? ~~If you don't know, all the endings have the same comic-style cinematic~~ Like, I'm actually really irritated and mad with this game. I was looking forward to it so much and everything that was great about the past games aren't even a part of this game. Nothing ties to the past games/lore at all. _This_ game, I would hardly say, has any lore.   Here's my non-spoiler questions: Who tf is Gregory. Why tf is Gregory there after hours? Why tf was Gregory there at all even before hours? Where tf are his parents? Why did Gregory randomly decide to _climb into Freddy after he malfunctioned onstage?_ _HOW_ did Gregory manage to get onstage to climb into him after he malfunctioned? Why can't Freddy scan him and find his guest information, or why doesn't he have a Photo Pass? Why is Gregory afraid of Vanessa, or why doesn't he want to be found by her? Who tf is Vanny? Why tf is Vanny? Wtf is up with these awful endings?   I have far more questions. You know... I didn't even expect to have many things answered about the questions we had about the past lore (questions that were full of MYSTERY and not "what the fuck"),  but I _did_ look forward to having more added to it. I'm not even going to trash/question some of the odd shit like the generators just hanging out in baby land like Mark pointed out, because there are too many genuine questions to be asked about the actual development of this game. It was all very clearly rushed, buggy, and not thought out. Did the dev team even follow along and enjoy the FNAF franchise before taking on this project, or did they just want to ride on the name and image that Scott worked so hard on to make it a success? Thoroughly disappointed. I can't even see how this can be followed up with another game when the endings are so cut and dry, and there was so much lacking in lore and mystery. By far my least favorite FNAF game. Even FNAF World was more intense and scary than this, with it actually having lore, mini games, sub worlds, interesting dialogue, horror and it's the most seemingly family friendly of the line up, but this one takes the cake as far as family friendly goes, which is not a good thing.   Thanks for coming to my TEDRant. No, I don't feel better. No, I'm not typically a keyboard warrior; just really invested in these games and enjoyed the franchise so much. If you read this novel and don't agree with me, that's okay, too. I respect your opinion. If you feel I'm being too harsh, I'm sorry. It's just my honest thoughts, even if they are pretty critical.
I really hope you come back tomorrow and make another episode concerning the leave option, dismantle Monty option, and over all find the other endings because otherwise that would be a very disappointing ending to the amazing series you have created.
wow part 7 of this predictable game before part 20 of minecraft
the game: Freddy dies                                              Mark: 17:58
the whole mark getting chased by monty was a movie 😭
Freddy couldnt find Mark but not to worry because Mark will find us!
this episode was so short
*Freddy dies* Mark: laughs Freddy when mark screams for his help: Karma bitch
"So freddy died cuz he didnt had all the upgrades to fight properly"
The ammount of suspense,relief, and anger I had when Monty chased mark and freddy just ran passed him omg I died 😂
Wtf just happend
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
Mark: FREDDY HELP Freddy: “your free subscription of friendship has ended please pay for the full one”
FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY FUCKING HELP MONTGOMERY IS FUCKING TRYNA MIRK ME
How He says nothing can hide from me now seems like you can trust him less
no one: Markiplier: FREDDAYYYYYYYYYYEEEEE
This game is so bad. They didn't put in the effort to animate the death scene, he brings up disappearances even if you never saw any evidence of them, they didnt bother to animate Freddy MOVING TO the Fazerblast room, just so much wrong with this.
Find me bitch.
Gotta love Freddy just running straight past Mark going up the stairs like "You called? But you were up there when you called so thats where i'm going, *Superstar!* "
@markiplier ya gotta play the princess quest games
Freddy just sprinting past mark😭😭
Game: "So you can't use the charging stations."     Mark: *Tries to use the charging stations*
Mark I came from delirious stream and if u go back to Roxy’s area and pick up the head again u can cheese it and it’ll set the time back without changing anything allowing you to save while working through out the entire game+
Oh wow
ME WHEN FREDDY DIES: *CRIES* MARKIPLIER: *LAUGHS* DID THEY NOT HAVE ENOUGH BUDGET FOR THE LAST ANIMATION *LAUGHS*
Sister location and Security Breach  *"NO, THATS NOT THE END"* *"There is no way that's the end"*
bruh that ending was bad
Yeah it's a shame a lot of areas in the game are underutilized. Imagine how fun it would be if you could actually play mini golf, race in Roxy's Raceway, or any of the other things in the mall that look fun. Seems like they put more effort into the graphics/3D objects than actual programming/gameplay.
The game is fine, until it tries to do *anything*, then it breaks down. There is *maybe* 3 good FNAF ish moments in the entire game. Everything else is a half baked piece of garbage Even from basic game design principles, hell the last sequence *alone*, having to redo a completely menial pointless repetitive and boring activity, a dozen times, for an unclear objective, let alone the near complete lack of autosaving and repitition as is seen in every episode?  It’s a bad game with a FNAF stamp on it. In every way. The developers straight up don’t know game mechanics or design or story or lore, and only *just* know technicality.
You should have just left the damn place
I love the voice over spots, they are just a delight!
Hey Mark. Play "one shot" again. There's more ya missed. You CAN save little kitty and the world.
Mark: I will come find you!  Me: Go ahead😏 (Jokes… unless…)
**mark running away from monty in terror***  Freddy; Runs past him and ignores him** Mark: FREDDY U BITCH
Kudos to for Mark getting through a glitchy game!
Next part 8 I think 🤔
There's like 6 endings mark.
so i looked up a few things for you, turns out there is more to vannys ending you have to play the princess quest 3 or 2 it gives you a different outcome of the ending. i hope this helps you have to win the princess quest in order to obtain a different ending i don't know if it will work but if you want you can try.
I love that half of this is just mark frantically screamig FREDDY FREDDAYYY YOU BITCH FREDDDYYYY
here before a million 😎😎
I never cried so much in my life
The fact that Mark doesn’t understand anything about this game yet DanTDM who has no idea what Freddy is gets every ending 3x faster than Mark is killing me including the secret one
for the love of god just LISTEN TO THE GAME
Mark please finish this final ending! I would honestly love what you see towards the end!
please tell me he is going to get every ending before this series ends.
When did anyone mention disappearances and why is a seven year old trying to solve it?
I feel like mark regresses sometimes in his gaming habits because of the large amount of indie games he playes. This whole playthrough you can tell he hasn't really given any thought to the fact that there might be multiple paths to things/multiple endings, even though he was able to get to areas early and he saw alot of things he couldn't/didn't do during this run.  Basically i'm saying the large amount of A to B linear games he plays, especially in the horror category, really works against him sometimes.  He complained about the game hand holding him during the surgery sections but then would ignore directions during the main sections and get mad it wasn't saying HEY GO HERE with indicators n shit.
"click on them or I will find you" Me: I'm not clicking them so please do
FREDDY FREDDYYYYY FREDDY LITTLE BETCH
Is Markiplier continuing this
Freddy: Dies Markiplier: *Concerned as why it is a comic book style*
i was literally sobbing over the first ending while mark is confused over it, like MARK LEMME HABE MY MOMENT
Okay Mark here's what you need to do, there is a secret ending that you can obtain, when you obtain montys claws you can head over to Roxy's raceway there you will find two doors (they look like fence doors, sorta like chicken wire, one has a yellow chain, the other a yellow speaker), one you can open with montys claws on Freddy and one you can open with chica's voice box on Freddy, there you will find an elevator, you don't wanna miss it
Everyone: “How many times do you want to repeat ‘Are you serious’ word?”  Markiplier: “Yes”
Unfortunately after Scotts retirement they had to rush this game. Despite all the bugs I think it's great that it still feels like FNAF
this game had so much potential if they fixed the bugs and made it make more sense
True ending do princess quest
There is a lot more to discover and these explain the reason vanny is the way she is why there is a giant area under the plex and there are more endings than you might think
Mark: *spamming the call Freddy causing Freddy to go everywhere* Also Mark: FREDDY, YOU BITCH!!!
yes sirrrrrrr!!!! awesome vid mark! im bout to play the game too. its in the middle of downloading. i hope the game is more awesome playing than watching. have a good night mark!:)
I don't think Fredyy is broken, but rather you just spammed his button WAY too much. See, Freddy is meant to come to you in need. So you hide and then when you're in the clear, get freddy to come to you.
You use greedy to much, you was surpose to play as Gregory all the time and be flipping sneaky, not a baka in a bot whole time xD
I agree with Mark's conjecture, this game is very clumsily and stitched together even if there are moments that shine, SO MANY BUGS AND GLITCHES. It should all work on paper but the actual videogame part is just bizarre.  Although I am very frustrated by the fact that the comment section is either comprised of bots or people who can't see through the game's shiny coating and pretty colors. I guess FNAF content just attracts children in droves nowadays.
here b4 500k views (ignore this its just for myself lol) anyways i really love this series  it makes me happy, sure its not as scary as the past games but the surroundings are so amazing and i love the designs of everything
Mark can you stop uploading??? Am trying to finish the old episodes, LIKE HOLY SHIT
watching all of these lets plays has reminded me just how little mark pays attention to dialogue and text
You can get the Vanny Redemption ending if you play all three Princess Quest arcade games
I literally died when they yeeted Freddy off the bridge
lesgooo
This game is definitely not over. There are multiple endings and probably a real end to this game. Sorry Freddy had been really stupid. 😊
FREDDY!!!! 😂😂😂
imagine not getting the bonnie easter egg
I hope Mark plays this a bit more,to get some of the other endings
Loosing my mind overhere. The way freddy runs away from you once e gets there... its I can't Marks screams Beutiful
11:23
this episode is so short it kinda sucks but the game is overall great in my option
Me: emotionally damaged because freddy just got slaughtered  Mark: wheezing at the apparent low budget    All of Tik Tok: wants to have sex with freddy
I've never been this early to a Mark video omg
Freddys dies: Many People "That is so sad" Mark "I donst understand what happen".
yes
Love this so much! Always anticipating the next episode! Also not me just laughing at Mark's suffering
Here before 300k views
yes
Nice way to consistently fail at calling freddy rather than just go and hide
Mark there are 6 endings in total
28:41 top 10 anime betrayals
Kinda disappointed this Episode was half the length of the other ones, Hope we get another video with more and Mark finding the secrets
Mark you can upgrade fred's batteries in parts and services
Freddy running past Mark instead of saving him from Monty while frantically screaming for Freddy's help was just hysterical!
This game seems to get buggier with every episode. First it was glitchy AI and placeholder textures not being replaced in time, last time it was dropped frames and entire jumpscares not loading in, and now the game is actually just sequence-breaking itself. It's like these devs just stopped working on the later parts of the game because they figured nobody would bother making it that far.
mark: *literally about to mauled by monty* freddy: _waiting his turn_
This is...garbage. I feel like I should be saying it outright, but minus Mark's hilarious and generally funny moments, the game itself was just completely went down hill. I was trying to be optimistic along the ride, and maybe when Mark uploads tomorrow something new would show, but for the story and game overall, just an utter disappointment. I feel like I can't be the only one who thinks that.
Mark: *running around the pizzaplex constantly pressing the call Freddy button, likely confusing the game with the spamming of the button*  Also mark: “ huh why isn’t the Freddy button working”
He keeps trying to use the charging stations but in the last episode they said they didnt work because the power was out
I've enjoyed every minute and second watching Markiplier do this epic  game. Happy Holidays to everyone.
We love when u suffer mark. Love you mark
They spent so much time animating 2 endings they ran out of budget for the other ones
Memories
I guess it’s because vanny is a real person and it would be too brutal, so they made the comic style ending.
Hey there’s more endings to get so you should try to get them
But the weird thing is you didn’t get Monty’s claws so to see them on Freddy is weird
The Moment of  Mark screaming in agony for Freddy an He Just Runs past him at the Speed of Sound I never laughed so hard in my Life 😂
Mark: “I will find you”  Probably everyone: “cool, please do that.”
hope you will get all the endings
Love waiting all day for this one and getting to watch mark be the stupidest person I've ever seen. Like it's not even funny, how can he literally try everything but what is obvious. GO TO THE FRONT FUCKIN DOOR. IT TELLS YOU CHARGERS ARE OFF. It's seriously just makes me not want to watch.
man, this game needed more time in the oven.
Sadly I think the calling Freddy is the same  When you click call he goes to where the player was standing when the command was put through. Repeatedly calling him doesn't update where he's going. He goes to the first spot and then moves on from there. So if you call him and wonder off, he still goes to where you were standing when you called him.
I’m not buying cloak merch, come find me.
I love how as Mark has gotten further into the game, he's completely forgotten, or just ignored certain mechanics that have been in use the entire time. AKA The Staff bots and their lights
Someone should make a complication of all of marks death throughout the series, the entire fnaf series
Through all these game plays you can genuinely see how frustrated Mark is with the game . He’s so frustrated with the story, the game play, how it functions and how it makes absolutely no sense at all.  Like why tf is Gregory there and how did he end up there and why is there back grace of his anywhere, who is Gregory???? The other Fnafs made more sense than this one .
Freddy: *dies* Mark: *W H E E Z E*
Gregory, I am afraid I must go up these stairs. Perhaps Monty will take care of you, I will see you soon
Here! Have a little hint on how to get a good ending!         It’s easy as 1 2 and 3 all you have to do is save the one who resides in the cabinets but lives prior to them
HAHAHHAHA THE FREDDY BETRAYAL WTF
It was really fun to watch all episodes but its shame that Mark didnt find good ending (in my opinion) for reaching good ending is to play Princess quest arcade game in Vannys room before accesing her PC
I feel like Markiplier needs a discord server
More please
Mark, you should take a break from SB until one or two more patches release so it's not so frustrating to play (and for me to watch, others may agree). In the meantime you can pick back up on Inscryption, among other things.
I'm just wondering....where are this kid's parents????
Go to the hole there’s a secret ending  Where there’s spring trap and Foxy and Bonnie
Mark: *Screaming frantically for Freddy to save him* Freddy: *Calmly walking behind Monty who is trying to kill Mark* "Hey Monty, haven't seen you for a while. How've you been?" Mark: *Still screaming*
IM SORRY, i absolutely love fnaf, but with this first Vanny ending what was that. like the pacing was absolutely atrocious and it honestly had me dying from laughter like what
part 8 when
I hope mark sees some of these comments with very useful info
im literally so confused lmfao
Can’t Freddy scream cuz of chica and stun animatronics like the moon one
Mark, I have not clicked the links. I have not seen you yet
Everyone knows everything very quickly while him 🤣🤣🤣
The last part was lit so good
Mark, the secret ending only requires Freddy to have Monty's claws and Chica's voicebox, you just decided to get Roxy's eyes which makes the game a whole lot harder.
Maybe it’s time for Inscription part 6 😑
that vanny ending was such a letdown bruh
I laughed way to hard at marks pained screaming about Freddy waiting his turn
gregery see that small vent have you heard of amoungus you need to vent i know its hard you have to be SUS
Okay i'm gonna say a very mean thing Freddy is supposed to be like a father figure right?he always leave Mark alone right?exactly as a dad do-
Really hoping to see him do all the endings.0
Hi
Mark: quick advice about the Faz Blaster:  Yes you can shoot the S.T.A.F.F Bots with the faz blaster but you have to hit them DIRECTLY it the eyes. If you do it right they will actually speak to you.  Also if you shoot the sign bots (those little yellow ones that stare), again in the eyes, they will do a little dance.
THAT WHOLE END WAS LIKE A CARTOON CHASE SEGMENT XD
I'm loving this
I lost it at the end with Freddie just running past XD.
So happy to watch this on my birthday! Thanks mark :)
Sure they broke him by making him work how he was intended... Not you spamming the button trying to make him work in a way that he wasn’t intended.
Hey Mark if you go back to roxy raceway after selecting you want to stay find the elevator doors that you couldn't go in before you will be able to access a ending
28:43 IM CRYING
loving that 90% of the gameplay thus far is just Mark screaming “FREDDAYYYYY”
Hey Mark! Idk if you’re gonna read this but here’s a little clarification. There are multiple different endings to the game. I won’t tell you what happens but some endings definitely involve BIG discoveries. Remember how you read about the weird thing taking energy from the pizzaplex underground? Well one ending let’s you figure it out. Just a hint.   If you want to know everything you should try to get all of the endings. The ending you got where Freddy died was the saddest ending.   But you missed some stuff while playing. The princess games (they mention those in the duffel bag collectibles) are MAJOR easter eggs you need to play. The first I think you already found where you ran away from the DJ and the second is located in vannys room at Fazerblast. Do them it order to understand the story. It tells the story of Vanessa and Glitchtrap from Help Wanted.   There is also a room that looks like a room in sister location you can find that gives you some tapes to listen to that explains Vanessa’s story and how she got here.       There really are a lot of Easter eggs to find and it will be pretty hard to get them all but it would be fun to watch you do it.   I hope this cleared this up for you or anybody reading this because ik it can be very confusing and I hate not understanding things. That being said it is a very big game and it’s practically impossible to get everything so don’t get to stressed about it. I think this game is meant to revolve around Freddy himself and is supposed to answer questions about the previous games. Very cool.  Anyways I love watching you play! Good luck! 😁
king of fnaf is back at it, lowkey makes me wanna rewatching the whole series
I don't think I've ever heard Mark's voice get that high before from sheer rage and terror.
If you do Monty golf instead of fazer blast they use the theatre in that option to get a security card and then you go in the basement below the theatre and get something else and it’s a smaller version of the endoskeltons chasing you
mark going on about the first ending being not real: see and because- me still in tears over freddy’s death line:  * nods in sad *
I love markipliera videos great job
This entire video was just Mark screaming "Freddy" huh
awesome!
28:44 top 10 anime betrayals
Well I’m early
Mark turns into a chipmunk and then explodes Me another lovely FNAF video
I thin they had to cut a lot from the game because it was delayed too much
Freddy: Gets disassembled and makes me cry by saying “You…are my superstar..”    Mark: *wheezes because comic*   (I DIDN’T KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE WOULD LIKE AND RESPOND TO THIS OMG LMAO THANKS)
Mark: "What are you doing here, you're early."  Me: "You're late..."
Lol
23:20 Golden Freddy’s sound (made by the CAUTION signs)
I want him to see the true ending so bad
The game Is not complete for me
Freddy running past him was hilarious lmao
17:50 You're laughing? Freddy just died and you're laughing?
There are four endings in this game, this will depend on the exit you choose and the decisions you take...      lol sorry for making it so mysterious xD
Nice
Freddy: It is never safe Also Freddy: Yes let's do this!
What's with all of the bots lately?
best intro ever XD
They literally stripped fnaf of the gameplay from previous fnafs and I think that was a bad move, the game was good but it’s just not the same as the previous games and they could’ve at least added a side mode where it is like the other fnafs. And you don’t even stay there for five nights youre literally there for 6 hours and that’s it
Without going into spoilers, get all three upgrades. There's an old elevator, you'll have to find it, I don't remember where it is, but all the articles are saying it's at the end of the game, and if I remember correctly, you need all three upgrades to get there. If you see this, Mark, good luck! You'll have to defeat Monty without saving, then make your way down there.
man this game sucks
Imagine this, Freddy goes up to Vannessa on the stage and a Gregory just falls out... she'd be so angry that that's where he was...
Why are the episodes getting shorter!?!?!?😭😭😭😭
FFRRREEEEDDDDDDYYYYY!!!! -Markiplier 2021
Please do continue to keep on your journey of this game with all of us
Steel Wool spent three years making the game, but for some reason they removed 50% of the game and 90% of the story before they released it, which is why the plot is a mess, the pacing is really haphazard, and why Vanny and Vanessa have so little presence.
Bro mark videos are always so funny they always make my dqy
28:43 Freddy running past Mark and him screaming was the best moment
You I needed to take chicas voice box and whatever the crocodiles name is arm no not his arm the clause
This is the moment where I wait for MatPat to interpret all of this
“Freddy is meant to help the player”  Also Freddy: Runs right past Gregory
no markplayer
Game: you can now call Freddy in the Fazzer Watch..  Mark: *Tries to call Freddy*
Told ya this game is a broken mess
Freddy didn’t give a damn to Mark 28:41
Posted 51 minutes ago 🙌 early gang
This is like a shitty fan game
Mark is clearly trying his best to like the game, but I think by the end of this video it was pretty obvious that he maybe came close to a bit of a breaking point, likely the reason for a shorter episode this time round.
I don't really get the "vanny mode" It don't make any sense.
I am legitimately CHOKING over Mark being chased by Monty while frantically screaming for Freddy, as Freddy just runs past him at a sprint, thus sending Mark into a hysterical moment of panic and frustration lmao.
Maybe he can take a save before changing the eyes and try to find collectibles witouth them... but with save feature?
Freddy a fake friend
Why did I get genuinely sad when they killed Freddy
God Mark Get the True Ending,Everyone is depending on you
That's funny how it uploaded minutes ago, I'm literally trying to catch up by watching the previous videos xD
Mark going to the main stage when Vanessa told him to is like in Portal 2 where the villain tells you to jump down a hole as you're trying to get to him and if you do, you die and get an achievement.
There are 6 endings there's only one cannon one which is the only non comic book ending
4:26 i wondering why the frick mark didn't just take the stage way up
freddy running from you is so funny 😭
Mark: *screaming for Freddy while running down the stairs*   Meanwhile Freddy: *runs up the stairs* ima take a few laps around the daycare then ill be right wit u fam
I watched part 6 just in time this was uploaded 17 minutes ago 😂 this has been really entertaining
Best ending just requires you to find the 3 princess quest games IN ORDER
I keep not watching the ending because I want to see what happens thanks for daily uploads mark
This is where the game shows the most flaws. In the previous episodes, the game was a bit janky but fun, while now it's clearly not finished. Gregory saying "if I go the disappearances won't stop" doesn't make sense, where the f did they ever talked about that or uncovered a secret about that ?? At that moment the game just feels like we're in the middle of the story, but they got out of budget so everything just sped up. Also like vanny is so confusing, she's just there in the game with no explanation and Freddy and Gregory don't talk about her a lot, and suddenly they talk about going to take her down ??
Just so you know mark. there are more than just two or three endings. There’s one ending in particular that will blow your mind I won’t tell you so it’s better to keep it a surprise
Feel free to disagree with me here but I personally believe that the five nights at Freddy franchise has finally jumped the shark. It really managed to get through six very successful, well done, and unique games. 7 is not any of those things. If they wanted this one to do well they needed to spend a lot more time on it and it’s obvious that the effort wasn’t there like it was on the others and/or using the open world map is not Scott’s forte. I was very excited for this game and it has a very cool concept but I am disappointed in it. Mark is handling himself very well in giving constructive criticism but not tearing it down
freddy: *fucking DIES*  mark: *WHEEEEEEEEZE*
Mark: Freedyyy  Me: Comedy gold  Montney: Non stop running at mark
scott cawthon retired mid way
Vanny is a beta tester from the Fnaf VR game who got possessed by Glitchtrap.
Game: *Tells you multiple times that you cant use re-charge stations when trying to find the exit* Mark: *Dies alot of time and sits through the part where they tell you that multiple times* Also Mark: *Tries to use re-charge stations multiple times while repeating the words "Are you serious?!"*
I think mark is losing his slag...
Monty chasing Mark: get over here kid  Mark: FREDDY GET OVER HERE!!!!!!  Freddy: Imma bout to end this man's career  *Freddy runs past mark* 28:36
Wait already part 7
Does anyone know what’s supposed to happen if you listen to Vanessa when you get close to 6:00 am?
YEA, FINALLY FINAL PART, I WAS WAITING!!!
Has a scene where Vanny is viciously ripped apart limb by limb shown in comic book form in a T rated game   Also mark: why wasn’t that animated
7:45 why does Mark sound like Rob Gavagin?
The "Freddy don't wait your turn" part and him just screaming at Freddy is hilarious
8:30 Mark: Becaowose furry confirmed
Mark can't handle the truth
im sobbing
I wish they would've at least voiced the endings :/
Mark is chased by Monty.  Mark: FREDDYYY!! Freddy: *Casually walks past*
Mark screaming Freddy durning that entire chase was hilarious
28:42  Freddy: that's what you get for laughing at me
I CANT WITH THIS PART 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  28:42
28:43 genuinely have never laughed harder than right now
Mark pulling a face like IT at the end of the video was not something I was expecting
Nahhh wtf, what is that comic ending-
“You are my superstar” RIP shawty
If there's gonna be a DLC revolving around Bonnie he better be jumpscaring you whilst *GIVING YOU A KNUCKLE SANDSWITCH*  Otherwise I'm going to be disappointed.
I just finished watching the previous video, fell asleep, woke up, and now we have this video
Game: charging stations are off from here on out Mark: yeah yeah I know how to go upgrade Freddy stop telling me....why are the charge stations off?
Fnaf 1 was released 7 years ago, time flies
I'm not clicking so come find me mark so I can make you some pizza to just add to your frustration XD

To delv into why mark thinks this game feels off. It was finished like a year late, coming from the franchise that drop the second third and fourth games so quickly, meaning there were things they skipped to get it out. And Scott left, whatever your opinion of him is after the leak I personally side with MatPat's conclusion, but the fact is that the creator left and with him some of the feel of what makes fnaf fnaf
Do it find me bitch
This game is more unfinished than my great grandmother's quilt.
See? If you were playing inscryption, you wouldn't be this dissapointed!
My drug addiction of waiting for a new episode has been sufficed
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation?" I've never felt my heart break from that one statement 🤣 He really said no to comic animation endings, utterly shocked but hilarious.
Vanessa:Go to the main stage you deserve a reward  Mark:THERE WAS NOTHING THERE YOU LIARRRR
you need to plat the game in vannys room to get a good ish ending
Love how Monty and Freddy just going down the stairs all chill catching up like old friends while Mark is having a panic attack
28:42, Freddy running past Mark while he's yelling for help and being chased by Monty has got to be the one of the funniest things i have ever seen in a game
Freddy goes to the location where q was pressed not to where you are so if you move after pressing q he won't follow unless you hit q again, so in reality had Mark only pressed Q once during the chase with Monty and then looped back using a round object such as the round planter in the balcony hanging over the daycare he could've reached Freddy though it would've been extremely close.
There is a secret ending but you have to decomission monty to get his claws
FREDDAYYYYYYYY
"FREDDY DONT WAIT YOUR TURN" Freddy: okay i'll just go around the long way
God I hope mark reads the comments
That Freddy/Monty part at the end had me in tears lmfao
This was just chaos and suffering
the endings with the comics are basically the bad endings/decent endings(1-2 stars endings), there's a true secret ending you can find near an old elevator shaft near roxy's raceway after choosing to stay.
I love how Marks experience with FNAF led him to just knowing that there was more to this game😂
Accomplished nothing this video.
the game feels so unfinished, i'm so disapointed of this game :/
There is a good Vanny ending when you beat all the princess quest games in order
28:36 LMAOOO IM DYING
I agree with Mark here, this game's story is really unfinished. Think about it, during this entire 8 hour journey, we literally know nothing detailed about anyone. No villain, no plot, no characters, no progression. Chica, Monty, and Roxy are not characters, they're obstacles to give this provide gameplay. Vanessa is shown twice and we no literally nothing about her. I genuinely don't why she was added, she is the only other human character and we never see her. Vanny is introduced as Antagonist out of nowhere? Literally no previous mention of it. It just appears in the middle of gameplay and the game tells you it's evil. If this were a movie, this game is like skipping 75% of the way through, then trying to figure what the hell happens at the end. There is no context for anything at this point. The story has so much cutted out, yet it treats everything as if it explained it to you. They don't explain it. After all these hours, I can explain this games plot in one sentence. I don't care how good the ending is, there is no story for 75% of this game, therefore the game play means nothing. I get this feeling that I skipped 2 episodes of content, but I haven't. This game just gives you nothing. If literally every event is fixed in the ending, this makes one of the worst paced games I have seen. The Vanny  scene is also so jarring. We see this character twice, know nothing about it, and then the game treats killing Vanny as killing the main bad guy. The entire time I was watching, I just thought " Am I supposed to care this?" I know every fnaf has problems with dumping everything at the end, and leaving its story to be overly speculated, but this game has done the worst job at this out of them all. This is an open world exploration game, you could handled the story telling so much better. It's an exploration game, most amount of player choice fnaf has ever given, a large world with amazing locations, yet the game doesn't give you a reason to care about it.
Not wanting to ruin it at all but I really want mark to find that ending *wink* *wink*
28:33 this shit had me dying 😭😭😭
Merry christmas!
I have a feeling that the controversy regarding Scott that happened a few months ago may have also caused the game to be rushed.
It kind of pisses me off how this game was so delayed and so hyped to just to be a buggy, 80 gig, unfinished seeming, not great looking game. It also makes me sad because this is the last game Scott worked on before he retired. This could have been so much more.
i havent played myself because im broke but just from watching you play it looks like calling freddy doesnt make him come to you but rather makes him come to where you were when you called him so calling him and then running away doesnt look like its going to work, if you have to run maybe try remembering where you were before and going back rather than call him again? i cant test it myself but i think it might work a lot better
It bums me out that mark isn’t fully enjoying this game. I don’t blame him, it’s broken, buggy, and lacks a lot of polish. I think there is a good game here, but there’s a lot… blank space?  Idk. If they are going to expand, it should go forwards not backwards. It’s surprising to see Scott, unless he didn’t work on this at all, let this come out like this. He always seemed very hard on himself at times.   Also a shame the map is so big but other than collectibles there’s no real reason to go in those directions and risk death. The collectibles would be nice if more of them gave story insight.
THANK YOU for not being afraid to post so many vids of one game in a row!!
I genuinely hate how much he screams

Top 10 saddest anime deaths-
Hi
Literally replayed the opening 10 times
EARLY BABY WOOOO
Mark still hasn't realized that Freddy runs to the location you called him... Not straight to you
I really enjoyed fnanf from you:)
Lets
4 more endings
Wait will there be another episode?
Yee
Okay, so of course there's a ton of different endings, and here's a hint to go to each one. Besides the one shown here...    1. The arcade machine within Vanny's hideout can only be accessed if you've played its predecessors in chronological order. 2. You're at the door, why not walk? 3. If you're at Security Level 7, then the controls to the loading dock should be accessible now. If you're not, well the passes to upgrade to that level should be accessible by now. 4. You have to be a VIP to use the fire escape exit in the East Arcade, accessed through El Chips. Best way to demonstrate your VIP state is to find the golden plushies. All 6 of them. The Faz Camera and cutouts of the original four are needed, for one of them. 5. There's something *really* wrong with Roxy Raceway. Specifically, what lurks below it.  Good luck, Superstar.   -- The Nightmare Tank (Signing it off with the original commentor's name, in order to catch them copy-paste bots slippin'! Just report 'em and move on. Liking or replying to them just gives them attention in the algorithm, so don't do that!)
Mark : calls for Freddy  Freddy : Hey look a detour!
18:05 Me: *crying because of Freddy* Mark: *laughing* wtf is that *continues laughing*  👁👄👁
I just love how there are many endings to this game
Mark for more content and security breach gameplay, there are 3 more endings!
27:53 is the first jumpscare that actually scare me in this game
only 30 minutes:(
Ngl i cried at that first ending
Mark: Continuously Screaming for Freddy to escape Freddy:  *No, I don't think I will* Mark: *FREDDY YOU BITCHHHH!!!*
please just finish the series so many other have already and it just feels like your dragging it on for longer then you need to.
FREDDYYYYYY!
lets gooo
Mark: *slowly losing his mind with this game* Me: *dies laughing*
The ending was in a comic strip thing because it wasn't the true ending. There's like, five I think, and the true ending is all animated, the other's aren't
27:52 made me shit myself holy fuck 🤣
Mark if you get the robot head in roxy raceway you can save the game
What is happening, I’m so confused
THANK GOD YOU DID ANOTHER ONE I JUST FINISHED THE LAST ONE
It’s sad how Freddy just screwed mark over at the end 💀
Mark just not leaving for so long is painful
The theatre is used in the alternate route
AFTON IS IN THE GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mark forgot that all save and charge stations deactivated when he did the eye upgrade 😂
Hope you have a Merry Christmas Mark!
there are six ending I looked it up  Leaving the Pizzaplex Alone: Players need to go to the main entrance at 6:00 am and choose the 'Leave' option. Gregory will leave Freddy behind and eventually be found by Vanny. Leaving the Pizzaplex with Freddy: With a Level Seven Security Pass in FNAF: Security Breach,  players should go to the Loading Dock and choose the 'Leave' option. Gregory and Freddy will escape in a van, and Gregory will solve Freddy's power issue by jumpstarting him with the van's battery. Confronting Vanny on the Rooftop: Players need to go to the emergency exit through the Prize Counter room and choose the 'Leave' option. Freddy will set the Pizzaplex on fire and sacrifice himself to kill Vanny and save Gregory. Saving Vanessa: For this ending, players need to beat all three Princess Quest arcade games. They are located in Roxy's Salon, the Arcade, and Vanny's Lair. The first two games need to be completed before players get to the end of the game at 6:00 am. To get to Vanny's Lair, players need to get to the Loading Dock with the highest security clearance. Players also need to have obtained the Fazer Blaster, one of many tools in FNAF: Security Breach like the Screwdriver or the Faz Camera. The final Princess Quest game will be in the security office through Vanny's Lair , and players can complete it to save Vanessa instead of sending the Security Bots after Vanny. Disassembling Vanny: With the Fazer Blaster minigame completed, players need to go to the Loading Dock and choose 'Vanny,' then complete the quest that ensues. While avoiding animatronics, Gregory needs to get to the security office and use the bots against Vanny. Stopping Springtrap (Canon Ending): The true ending will play out when players choose to go to the Old Elevator at the end of the game. Freddy will be taken over by Springtrap, and it's up to Gregory to defeat him by using the three monitors and buttons to burn him. Players will also need to avoid the animatronic enemies that come for Gregory and use the doors to temporarily lock them out. When Springtrap is burned, the Blob will attack him making sure he doesn't get free. Freddy and Gregory will be shown escaping and sitting on a hill together.
Please say theres gonna be a part 8 where mark does all the endings and collects all collectables like he did with pizzeria simulator
game: “recharge stations are offline, so they can’t protect you” mark: “IM GONNA GO TO A RECHARGE STATION”
the ending of this is so fucking funny jesus christ  bring back teleporting freddy
*Spoilers*  Mark was so nonchalant about Freddy’s death in the first cutscene and I was CRYING. I was so emotionally invested into the parental figure robot and that “You are my superstar” made me sob.
I love seeing him yell at Freddy when he’s not being sneaky at all, and playing the game terribly 😂
The story went from 100 - 0 real quick.
I am so disappointed in this game, this is like a We Happy Few situation for me - the idea for both games and the lore is so fascinating and fun but they both fuck up with the reparative nature of the games.  I am aware that the FNAF series is a repetitive concept but the reason why it worked is because it was SHORT and to the point, and on top of that, although We Happy Few was a reparative boring mess - it managed to keep to it's theme and stay to it while this game doesn't.  The game is not scary at all, mainly because the idea of a big place like this with lots of lights ruins the fact that it's supposed to be a scary game, on top of that, the same thing I critise all the FNAF games appears here - loud jumpscares so that the game manages to give you a cheap scare.  I wouldn't recommend it at all and also, the fact that all the endings are 3D animated is so dumb, unless they were crunching for time or actually ran out of budget, there is no reason why.  I'd still play the game but for the same reason why I played We Happy Few, just to get through it so that I can experience the lore myself - no point to play the game, unless you're a FNAF fan.
Try to go back into the day care pls
The way Freddy just runs past him 🤣
I think Freddy just goes to the spot you called him at, so if you move he still goes to wherever you called him to.
When you had to put the eyes back in the cc said let’s begin putting daddy’s face at 3:48 😎
I hate the cheap comic book ending. Such a fucking cop out
I haven't seen the whole video yet, but if you get all the upgrades and go under the Roxy raceway through a fence with Monty's claws, you can go into some rubble and find Fazbear's pizza place, from FNAF 6, where the toasty rabbit man Springtrap comes out of a charging station and tries to control Freddy, and then chica, Roxy, and Monty will try to kill you. It will kinda be like ultimate custom night. This is the True ending.
markkkkk the princess quest machines.....
Freddy:  *Explains the charging stations won't work anymore.  Mark: *Attempting to use charging station "Are you serious?" x 27
They make Freddy go to the last spot you were at, did you notice how he just walked past you. So moving while calling him isn't the best idea.
This is getting crazy
earky gang
Can someone tell mark he can upgrade freddy's battery and there is a canon ending which you need Monty's claws and then you go down to Roxy raceway where you found a special gate for Monty's claws to cut. Then it will lead you to the canon ending.
ayyyyyyy idc its half 11 rn and I should sleep but uhhhh- im watching this rn =D
Vanny kinda thicc ngl...
Nobody:   Mark: 'FREDDYYYYY!!!'
Mark, there are more endings. However the Vanny choice leads to the true, at least assumed, instead of disassembling Vanny, you have to go over to the arcade cabinet.
I believe comics are for non cannon endings
There was no golden Freddy jumpscare this time -_- I am unsatisfied
I love how Mark is like "Hmm well maybe it's cause I didn't get all of the upgrades for Freddy" No lmao that route is just shit in general, this game is so unfinished and it shows
Mark: where gonna explore the endings    The video ending with  FREDDY!
I don't know how it works, but doesn't the "call Freddy" button ping him to your current position? if it does, I think spamming it really fucks with Freddy's pathing. I could be wrong.
FREDDY JUST RAN RIGHT BY LOL
Love this game, especially that sequence with the giant dj, BEST MUSIC IN THE GAME, and the most intense sequence in any fnaf game.
Is this an indie game ffs?
From what it looks like, the way the new summoning works is Freddy will go to the spot where you first summoned him.
Freddy: *dies* Markiplier: *STREP THROAT*
I love how Mark doesn't even have the Monty claws upgrade but in the cutscene you can see Freddy has Monty's hands regardless
Dude this play through has been the hardest to watch the amount of times mark overthinks everything or misses the smallest detail that’s explained to him in a note has caused me so much pain I hope he finds the glitch that lets you save or it’s gonna be pure suffering watching him find all the secrets
When Mark doesn't realize that summoning Freddy, he goes to the last ping. Because he keeps moving and pinging, he's confusing the game. It's Mark being Mark that's causing him issues.
Bby, do NOT stop uploading daily! 🗣Let’s gooooo!
Freddy just running past Mark while he's getting chased by Monty has me dying.
Freddy you bastard!! Lol my favorite line ever!!
This game is cool but looks like it could have used another year or so in the oven
19:15 Hearing all this actually just makes me sad because Mark sounds genuinely excited to uncover the "true ending" and find out what's really going on when the truth is, the game just has a bad almost non existent story with the main Villian getting less screentime than in a FarCry game. I thought the game was fun and will be buying the DLC, but the game has an almost unbelievable amount of flaws.
Game: "You can't save from this point onward"  Mark: "Guess I'll collect all the things i missed now"  Lmao
Anyone else notice the 'bruh' in the URL?
28:42  Mark: FREDYYY  Freddy: SEE YA!!!
I’ve been waiting all day for that disappointing video. It wasn’t fully bad, you screaming on top of your lungs for Freddy as he catches up with Monty was the best.  I really wanted you to see when you bust up Monty.
Suffering is key to a happy life
awww.... i still want him to be on the true ending after he get monty's claws... and go down to the basement...
I wonder what Mark is doing rn:l
PERFECT TIMING FOR A MARK VIDEO FOR DINNER!!  Edit: Okay after finishing the video I was both tensing at him going "FREDDY!!!!" but also laughing so hard my eyes watered up as Freddy just ran past him like "NOPE."
I hope he continues with the series
Go to the grey fence hint hint a secret ending
I REALLY HATE the decision to make the ending a comic. Like who decided that it really leaves me and some other people ive noticed unsatified and it feels cheap. Like mark said its like they ran out of budget
I love how mark never realized the reason Gregory went to the medical room was solely to hide from Vanessa            (I think)
Can you make a part 8 and do more secrets and endings and stuff please
called it, bad ending...  oh god, Mark, you are going about this the worst possible way...
Freddy running past Mark when he needed him the most was peak comedy
Game: tells mark to get to a recharge station Mark: completely ignores it Game: well then you die Mark: Surprised Pikachu face
i may be overthinking this, but is mark done with security breach now? i hope not, i hope he stays to finish the other stuff!
Mark: FREDDDYYYY help me you bastard  Freddy: I’m here… sike
Would you post SOMETHING other than FNAF
5:06 freddy is not smart. absolute himbo. we love him though
a
Vanny is hiding quite a body under that bunny suit...and I'm sure that statement doesn't come off as creepy as I wrote it 😬
Hope im not the one who waited like 7 hours for this video.
Wait but Mark is gonna explore more parts right?? Theres still so much he hasnt gone to, or lore he discovered
Shoot freddy 4 times he says some pretty funny things
FREDDDDYYYYYYY
Oh come on. Did they really go out comic style? Why couldn’t they animate these scenes? That’s just lazy and dumb.
i think freddy dying in that Vanny ending made him brainless later on in this episode
9:26 PH Script or Rule34 ideas
Is this what Christmas feels like 🥲
i love how mark laughs at freddy's death
Play the game in vanny’s room
God why are there so many bots
Tell me this is not the end, my brain want's to know all the extra stuff! We have seen 75GB of game but there's 10GB to discover boy XD
Who else think Mark should release the footage of him suffering throughout this game. Because I want to see those clips!!
"FREDDYYY FREDDYYYY" runs past him lmaoo
This game has (from what I’ve seen) 12 different endings and you also did things in a very weird out of order way so that might be why u felt the game played out weirdly, nonetheless loved the videos.
You know, I don’t think he gets how Freddy was summoned in the first place. He goes to where you called him, not where you are at the moment. So it doesn’t work  if you keep calling him when you’re moving; it’s just a game of -catch up then.
Mark: Maims two of Freddy's friends Freddy: "I'm glad you're staying! Buddy!! I love you!! :DDD"
Man I hope Mark gets all the endings
jeez this game is bad
"FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY YOU BITCH" OMG THIS PART😂😂
The screaming lol, sorry but the screams are so funny to me lol
Yeah, there's several endings here. I feel like you'll need to have at least another episode or two to get them all, let alone any sort of "custom night" stuff that may show up.
Is anybody gonna talk about how mark ended the last episode early so we can watch the “true” ending, and then in this he spends five minutes doing that, and then for the next 25 minutes he literally does nothing
If you bring Freddy to Bonnie’s Bowl and go while you’re inside him, he talks about Bonnie.
Dang
I imagine the last scene with Vanny being 'disassembled' was made into a comic strip instead of a fully animated scene because they couldn't have a scene with the security bots tearing Vanny (who is just a woman in a cloth bunny suit) to shreds without the game getting an M rating
Markiplier: “Can I save now?”  Freddy: “These eyes are amazing.”
Bad guy: go to the main stage  Mark: ok  Mark: *dies*  Mark: WhAt Do YoU mEaN
Why does this feel like The Iron Giant, man! 😭😭😭
Mark: Needs boyfriend  Also Freddy: Looking for Girlfriend
Why the heck did it change to a comic drawing randomly lol
I love how monty starts chasing him and Mark is just screaming freddy while running away from both of them
Good news it is almost a co-ck💀
28:42 betrayal
Probably the scariest part of the entire game is when the S.T.A.F.F. bots just brutally jump freddy like a pack of hyenas, and for vanny is also the exact same thing but worse cuz she's actually a human inside the bunny suit, so that could be directly compared to a pack of hyenas catching thier next meal, but minus the eating alive part
The issue with the cohesiveness you talk about is correct I think, but also- The game relies a lot on the duffelbags you find throughout the game, they give you hints about what to do next, give you lore to the game, and give you locations to where a key item is. I don't think I saw you look at the messages you got from the duffelbags. While the game is definitely unpolished and kinda a buggy mess, it's not as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. If you play the game by looking at the messages and paying close attention to what Freddy says throughout the game, the game becomes a little more enjoyable and cohessive.
hard
goodd ending
Dam was watching the series and saw the playlist changed to 91 vodeos to 92 lemme finish the rest of this (Edit) BACK AND ITS TIME TO WATCH
28:21 got real intense right about here lol
Gregory sounds a bit like ash from Pokemon
28:42 FREDDAYYYYY!!!!!!!! FREDDAYY YOU BITCH!! FREDDDAYYYYYYYYYYY! *FREDDAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!* Freddy, no, don't wait your turn god dammit, freddy, freddy?! Wha- oh- oh my god, oh no no not like this not like this. FREDDAYYYYY, oh my god oh my god are you serious are you serious right now, you cannot be serious, freddy- FREDDY- *monty jumpscare* OH MY GAWD FREDDAYYYYYYYYYYYY. FREDDAYYYY YOU BASTAAAAAAAARDDDDD. [end scene]
is it me, or does Vanessa sound a bit sexual with the "come back to the main stage. I got you something"
:C
The comedic timing of Freddy just running past Mark in his time of need is just perfect, they even stare at each other before running in separate directions lol
Only 46 minutes ago and look at how much likes and comments you got *cries miserably*
Mark you did 1 out of the 6 endings
This game is basically Markiplier losing his mind more with each episode
watching this in vr was a whole ‘nother experience
You did two things wrong, one is you were supposed to put the Monty out of commission, then Chica, then Roxanne. Second is you were supposed to go to any exit to go onto the next chapter or something though you probably did that
1hr gang
Love you my guy but please use your fricken gun!
4:56 Not dying is not an option In the FNaF universe, you should know that by now.
I lost my shit when mark started yelling for Freddy at the end there 😂😂
17:09 Im guessing every ending is presented like this. 28:40 What spamming the Q button does to a man. Oh and also first Monty jumpscare, i think.
Mark: "FREDDY!!! I NEED YOU!!!" Freddy: "hold on, gotta wait for my pal Monty to go down the stairs."
Nah bc I almost cried when Freddy got dismantled
It honestly feels like this game could’ve used more polish. Steel Wool said Vanny was supposed to appear more often but she got bugged. Every ending has those same comic book cutscenes except for one ending with 10 seconds of running away. It almost feels like they ran out of budget mid game and rushed to get to the endings.   There definitely was a different story that they scraped because the trailers showed Vanessa saying she’d help them as you passed her in an elevator. We know neither of those things happen and it leaves Vanny feeling like a distraction. The only person who could take the spot of the big bad is Afton but he returns for a few minutes and doesn’t talk.
Sup, You have a choice.
Ey was waiting for this everyday
you need to defeat monty and finish the story you actually got one of the bad endings
👺you're late.
A
Biggest betrayal ever caught on camera 4k 28:38
Mark screaming for freddy until he got jumpscared is really hysterical
This Mark diaries editing style is everything! ...but I hope you take a break after this series!!!!! You've been working too hard!
i love how freddy COMPLETELY ditched Mark at the end
I think the game has like 7 endings
Im interested to see if Mark is invested enough in getting the true ending to possibly go back to an earlier save. It seems like there’s a reason you cant save after upgrading Freddy (from what others have spoiled it seems so too) as in doing more before that upgrade and getting to the ending sequence.
*monty chasing mark* MARK: FREDDY FREDDYYYY FREDDYYYY Freddy: *runs past him*
FREDDYY!!!! FREDDY FREDDDY FREDDY YOU BITCH, FREDDYYYYYYYHYYYY!       This episode basically
Marks screaming is so funny 🤣
Yep, the game has some problems that clearly needed more time lol. I mean we get to 6am but haven't dealt with Monty. The whole "end game" part won't let you save so trying to do everything leftover/missed would be hell. Who the heck would want to play something like that. The in game time makes no sense and they had another year to work on this game to. There's so much wrong with this game sadly. Could this be the bad end to fnaf.
Mark you Legend another awesome video
Literally just finished the previous episode. Let’s go boys! :D
This game makes Fready so endearing in such little time.  Fready is best boi.
Was waiting all day for this. 😫
This game's awesome! By the way Mark, there are a lot of endings I will not spoiler anything but the thing is that the endings are more than one🤩😂more than 4 I think! Hope you make videos of them all
Well there are 6 total ending in FNAF security breach if you don't believe me look it up
5:43 History in the making
currently sobbing bc freddy died . naww i cannot DEALLL
Hey mark, there r like 7 different endings good luck my boy this videos r literally amazing
Hey Marc you should take a little break then try to get good ending
I am disappointed and underwhelmed.
the leave option is an ending, and there is a second ending with the Vanny option involving the arcade machine by the way.
you should try the secret ending >:D
What disappearances?!
Wait, he’s not playing anymore 🥺
YES LETS GO! This is the best part of my Christmas break. Thank you so much for posting daily, because I can’t get enough of this
0:04 This video hasn't even been 10 seconds, and I'm already laughing like a hyena.
THE WAY FREDDY ABANDONED MARKPLIER. 🤣
The screaming of you made me laugh
😏GOODNESS MY, Mark has such an SEDUCTIVELY PHENOMENAL voice that just makes me MORE ENTERTAINED in watching his vids. BTW there’s…….. something about this FNAF game that is just BEYOND UNSETTLING😳 😬  ✌🏽👱🏾‍♀️✌🏽
Hey. I know a glitch that let's you save after 6AM. It's on YT somewhere. Idk if it has been patched though.
TIS NOT THEE END
So was this the last fnaf episode my mark ?
i would call the fbi but i don't think that would be neccessary
Well he tried the bad ending well there's more
27:53 SCARED ME SO BAD
How many times did he just say are you serious
the whole sequence of the Monty chase and desperately trying to get to Freddy had no business being so funny
What a coincidence! I just finished watching part 6!
there are more then 3 endings
Haven't been this early
Freddy being a poor excuse for a loyal canine companion just makes it so much better 😭
Markiplier in this episode: FREEEEEEEDYYYYYYYY
IM KINDA EARLY????
Top 10 anime betrayals
I am boy times 10
good news! it is almost a cock! freddy, i only just met you
imagine being amy just hearing “FREDDYYYYY FREDDY YOU BASTARDDDDD”
I wish you a Merry Christmas Markiplier
27:55 That's a whole Scooby-Doo chase sequence right there, but without telefrag killing him on loop.
28:42 THE BEST PART 😭
Are we allowed to admit yet that this game is buggy as hell and full of holes and strange contrivances?
Yea maybe Scott retire just cus he's tired on giving idea on how the game would be played  The game feel so short
Totally not sobbing cause of the bad Freddy ending……
There’s more than one ending
Imagine if vanny is the mother of the girl that possesses the puppet or someone who has had things happen to them in the past in relation to the Freddy's food industry and wants to put an end to the company and the dark secrets. Could be a victim from the past
PART 8 NOW!!!!
We watch freddys evolution into a 5000 pound murder puppy
Bruh mark yelling at freddy to come help him well monty was chasing him was hilarious 🤣
28:40  Mark: FREDDY HELP Freddy: Nah I’m good mate
I get it's probably Scott's first game in this style, but it so so unpolished. From teleporting animatronics, janky controls, voices not lining up with subtitles 40% of the time etc was it released early? It feels so rough
mark wtf was this game im so sorry you had to play it, its so poorly paced
You gotta attempt/try the hidden/cannon/real ending which you can obtain by choosing to stay Freddy gives you a party pass. defeating Monty to gain his claws. Upgrading Freddy's hands and finding a hidden area at Roxy's raceway that takes you deeper under the pizzaplex
A shit guys the next 3 parts of this series is just him collecting not even realizing if he dies he loses it all            this mf...
The medical emergency was Freddy pretending that you had one so he could hide you from the night guard
Lol. I mean, give them the benefit of the doubt if you want, but fnaf never really did know how to make a game, you're sitting in a room looking left and right. The lore is all just stuff the fans made up, and 90% of it is just so random and doesn't make sense anyway. They just bit off way more than they could chew with this one, but I do appreciate trying to not milk the exact same game of sitting in a room looking left and right for a 27th time.
Yesterday was my birthday and I wished for everyone to have an amazing 2022!
There's more endings uwu
Time for markiplier to find all the endings and have a nightmare doing so
I would love to see all the endings
The way Freddy just sprints past mark as he's on the verge of dying to Monty 😭😭
Mark talking about how unutilized the theater is in the plot while not knowing it's part of the Monty upgrade path is great.
I did not expected that edit at the begining, pulling out a mansl4y3r like that Mark XD
28:47 IM CRACKING UP HAHA THE WAY HE JUST RAN PAST
I thinks Scott cawthon getting canceled affected this game a lot in what mark was talking about in the end
Freddy: (dies after bidding farewell to Gregory) Mark: *WHEEZING INTENSIFIES*  Also Mark:  Mark: (rapidly pressing button) Freddy Help! HELP! Freddy: (runs away past Mark and Monty ) Mark: *OHMIGOD FREEEEDDDYYYY!!FREDDY, YOU BAAAASSSTAARD!*
30:16
Watching Mark go through this game was a chore. I mean, its a different style of gameplay than the other fnaf games where its just point and click in an office. It also doesn't help that this game is very buggy and can ruin the experience. Fnaf is a very lore driven series, so if you miss some info from the bags, you just don't know what the hell is going on. I love fnaf and I enjoy this addition but I just need to watch the next fnaf theory so I feel like I understand what the hell is going on
27:53 till the end is definitely my favourite 😂
The true ending requires you beat all the princess games in order And get all the upgrades
From 28:25 to 28:50 I WAS WHEEZING XD I NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I ALMOST CHOKED
28:42 "Move aside, child! Gregory needs me!"
Mark: "watching a sad scene"  Also Mark: "Laughs in confusion"
mark, if you read this somehow, get all of the endings. Please
28:38 Freddy had enough 🤣🤣
Mark you have to do the other endings please
That comic book ending... Ouch. It looks like they actually ran out of budget, and just colored/animated the storyboard for the final cutscene.
Gregory, I'll be right with you, I have been summoned to Gregory, don't die a little longer, I believe in you, superstar.
These playthroughs make my day, thank you Mark for giving such content.
Well there are several endings in this game that u didn't know but there is one true ending that you'll be shocked to see but I won't spoil what it is since you rather found out by yourself so.
300k views in 30mins, seems like people are waiting for this
To get one of the ending you can finish all the missions on the arcade game
Freddy just ran right by him.
I find it hard to believe he is going through a chase and forgot hiding and staying out of Monty's Line-of-sight was a possibility.
Do the other options and try to go to monty golf instead of faz blast or whatever it was called
Dam this game so buggy, how tf are people still so dedicated to this series. props to mark sticking through with it
bro i did not sign up for heartwrenching plot in fanaf hello??!?
28:33 best moment
This was hilarious 28:42
try to go back to the daycare
Why does Vanessa sound so suggestive when she says Gregory deserves a reward
28:18 "Freddy I need you" 28:42 (Runs past Mark) 28:45 "FREDDY RIGHT HERE!!!!" 29:18 (Mark dies) 29:20 "FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!!!!" This episode really is Mark getting deuced by Freddy.
Do leave mode I’m very curious lol
Is there gonna be next part or no?
when will mark learn to look both sides of the road before crossing!?
11 minutes and already 7,540 comments and 368,097 views
We waited so long FOR THIS WEAK SHIT  Bruh I’m switching to Cory
Hey Mark, the theater is important for a secret that has to do with the cramra, caebord cutouts and a poster. The poster is in the theater of the OG anmtrontics. Just something helpful. And I love your videos keep up the good work!
Rip 15:20      P
mark freddy goes to where you call him so if you call him on the right side of a room he will go there even if your now left. try circleing around to him
Freddy would you like to stay or leave  Gregory vanny
Will go down in history as the only fnaf mark seems to HATE. Most broken as well
Mark: FREDDY!!! FREDDY! COME BACK,YOU ...!!  *Freddy didn't listen to it
Amazing game
The part when freddy ran pasted mark while mark is getting chased was funniest thing ive ever seen today XDXDXD
28:40 100% best bit
I literally just finished 6th part
vanessa seemed like a sweetheart in the trailers, so I hate that she's crazy and mean in both human and Vanny forms
Pin this comment for a Christmas present      Check your Christmas tree
when freddy ran past mark when he was running from monty, i fucking lost it.
Am I the only one that actually cried when Freddy died in the first ending?
Loved your playthrough but damn this game is a disappointment
will there be part 8?
This did not feel like 30 minutes, goddamn...
Everyone ive watched has gotten the worst ending
28:43 freddy be like "see ya nerd" LMAOOOOO
*monty chasing mark in stairs*  *freddy waits his turn*  Mark: NO FREDDY WONT WAIT UR TURN
Not me crying over an animatronic, no. No.
Damn
I don't have any idea on how much control Scott still has after resigning, but maybe the reason the game (probably) got bungled later on in development is because his retirement screwed with scheduling or planning.
I don’t understand why they removed the ability to save after 6:00 am. Why force it to everyone? Why not put a simple mode ? it make the game super difficult for no reason.
when Vanessa is your real name rip
freddy goes to where you press q not where you’re at. that hasn’t changed.
What is one thing William Afton has said "I always come back" so where is he maybe he is under the building.
ngl this game is like,,, amazingly bad for the budget and the extra year they took to release it. it has great graphics and some points are good but it's very badly written
LETS GO RIGHT ON TIMERE
this is honestly the worst game it possibly could've been. thanks Mark for these videos.
It took Mark 6 parts to get to hour 6 He spend more than 6 real life hours to play this game and still hasn't finished it.
The game isn't like the trailer either, it is probably when the game developers changed or something, right?
28:42 WHEN HE RAN RIGHT PAST HIM I LOST IT
This is the most clear video I’ve ever watched
I love the Limony Snickett vibes from the pauses
There’s 3 endings I think
Vanessa's voice when telling Gregory to check the main stage 😩😩
41306th!!
"FREDDY!! DONT JUST WAIT YOUR TURN!" Thank you for putting time in your days for making these videos Mark. I really appreciate you!
Wait so is he not going to finish the other endings etc? “I’m done” is the reason I think that
“are they on a budget for the last animation?!” he took the words right out of our mouths
This game feels so empty
freddy betray you
aaaaaaaanyways merry christmas 🙀
28:39 why do i get da'za voo watching this
That first ten seconds killed me🤣🤣🤣
This game fuckin  r e e k s
If still possible, you can just a glitch where you can pick up driver's head again and it will take you back in time to the time you first picked up the head. It's cheating but I feel like in this current situation with Animatronics, it's extremely helpful.
Mark's slow descent into madness while trying to find lore stuff fills me with immense pleasure, every time. (not in a weird way, I think?)
This has to be the Fallout New Vegas: Dead Money of FNaF
I like this game, but is it just me or is this game kinda wonky and disjointed at times?
Thought your videos were blurry I just needed glasses
Merry Christmas everyone
“FREDDDYYYYY!!!!!”
27:48 by far the scariest moment in horror game history I've ever jumped at.
this game fucking suuuucks like steel wool just kinda gave in didn't they
I do so love watching Markiplier flail about and suffer. <3
28:33 Freddy! FReddy!! FREddy!!! FREDdy!!!! FREDDy!!!!! FREDDY!!!!!! (runs right past him) FFFFFFFFFFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Idk if it's just me but this game is...not  very well made...
I can’t wait for the next video
Ngl I cried when Freddy said ur my supper star
29:10 - 29:21 oh my god, I can't stop laughing
MARK VANNY IS VANESA DUDE also its 7 next is 8
“Freddy you bitch!” New favorite line
Mark, There is a way to save after 6AM, you need to go back to the robot head that you needed for the race kart in roxy's raceway and trigger the time set by picking up the head.
Buckle in, Mark, you have a bunch of endings to find, and an old foe to vanquish once again. Make sure you find all three Princess games and play them in order.
Is Freddy real a good guy at 28:41 ?
Mark. Click vanny again. But instead of clicking the disassemble vanny button. Play the princess quest game.
2 minites ago
clupgrade-? clawpgrade-? how tf do you spell that mark
Mark do the afton (aka springtrap) ending in the future plz
I needed this thank you so much hope they fix Freddy
Aren't there like four or five endings to this game?
exited for new endings also amazing outro choice
41 minutes ago hmm. Earliest I've ever been. Also Mark your the only person I've seen play this that never thinks Freddy as a Father figure.
You need to check out what that thing draining power under the map is
i love waiting for these each day it brings  a smile to my face
Mark: what are you doing here? you are early.  Me in a fnaf fase again: perhaps.
"FREDDY YOU BASTARD!!!" was peak markiplier for me. lmao.
Wow, this game is like, 60% finished. lmao. There's so much missing that the story makes no sense.
HOLY SHIT i’m early YAYA
There is something Near the Roxy rease
In every episode, Markiplier has been slowly losing his sanity.
Freddy: your a superstar  Mark: YOU BASTARD!!!!
What happens after picking the "Vanny" option is one of the most confusing things i've seen in a game.
28:42 Confirmed. Freddy is a traitor the whole time. Funniest moment
Mark saying what we all thought about the ending: "Did they run out of budget for the last animation?"
He will find me
At 1:47 is that the sister location card board cut out?
Not mark forgetting that he said the charging stations are offline
Mark you shouldn’t keep continuously pressing Q for Freddy, because when u summon him, he goes to where u press Q, not where u are currently.
Freddy: "Good News! It's almost a cock!" 😆
Only 30 mins cmon
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I need one more part just one more.  PLEASE!!  This is the first time I’ve been able to follow something this cool live.    Maybe after the holidays gives us a special treat please please please.
Been waiting all day . Glad to know the series be continuing so we can figure out the secrets 😯
marks the only youtuber i don’t skip the ads for
Seems like when Freddy is called he just locks in on where he was pinned, which is why he can completely pass Mark, because he was pinning him everywhere. I think that function is more meant for when you're stationary and not running for your life
freddy is literally like an untrained puppy
note to self, don't spam the freddy button mark!
28:42 "When the world needed him most, he vanished." He fucking just yeeted past you. Funniest shit ever.
Hey mark can I have a shoutout next time when you make another part.
Freddy running right by Mark while he is running for his life was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen
Freddy running around not knowing where to go.  Mark panicking while trying to escape Monty: FREDDY!!!!!!!
Weeeeeeeee!
This game is cool, but it is a complete mess
So many unanswered questions. Who is Greg? Why is he not in thier records? How did he get in thier? Etc Can't wait for all these to be answered in the next game!
I wait all the day for this video !
Here we go again :)
HEY MARK!!!! Here is how to get the True Ending: Do Monty to get his upgrade for Freddy, then go back to ROxy Raceway. In the raceway on ur left when entering is a door leading down. U can open the gates when u have all of Freddy's upgrades. Once u do that take the elevator and have fun with the True Ending!!!
Mark: "Freddy!! Freddy!!" *Freddy runs past him* MARK: "FREDDY!!!!!!!!!"
My guess, and I’m not done with the video yet I’m 40% in, is that all these parts from freddies friends will either corrupt him or make him pissed and the last thing you gotta do is run from papa fred
i dont know if youll read this but there are 4 different endings to this game
Hold on babe mark just posted a new security breach vid
Is this the last episode?
I didnt get the notification 😤
You need to play Princess quest 1, 2 ,3 inside the game then you will have an ending
Freddy: *getting ripped into pieces* Mark: “what”
Markiplier screaming at Freddy on 28:35   This scene needs to be animated! 😂
I would agree with you that the game has so many underused non-cohesive details and perhaps initially the game was meant to be played quite differently. Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
i couldn't stop laughing when monty was chasing mark down the stairs and freddy dramatically ran up the stairs past mark and past monty
Oh boy. Mark has no idea just HOW MUCH of the game you have to complete without saving...
Me at the end: ...Ok, I'll click on them, but I won't really check them out all that much, but I will click on them so you don't try to come to my house. I know you don't know where I live, but I AM worried that you will find my house sooner or later.
Ok now im done with this one now where is the next one
Mark is a secret of golden Freddy in the game so find out
Mark there is the true ending where you need to get all the upgrades if you stay and then you can go to Roxy raceway and there is a get back there which you use monty claws for but I won’t spoil the rest
Hey Mark, you might want to explore the rest of the place. There are multiple endings.
can't wait for the afton ending
Mark screaming for Freddy has me rolling, Freddy trying his best mate
"FREDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY OH MY GOD YOU BASTAR- "
oh how far we’ve come with mark playing fnaf
yey
That local druggie high asf on a Monday morning : 11:13
Love the commentary over the frozen frame bit. It's great to hear Mark's thoughts after the fact. Hope to see this in more videos!!
Is he done with this?
Anyone feel like HALF the play through is just mark being lost?? I mean I get lost while watching too, but like.. he shouldn't have been lost that much
I think Gregory is the kid from fanf 4
Mark, I love you, but I hope you realize you're overcharging Freddy's commands when you press Q so many times 😅 When you call him with Q, you're telling him to go THERE in the spot where you pressed it, NOT to follow you This might be late, I know you're doing your best Mark, thank you for the videos!
Freddy waiting politely on the stairs for his turn while Mark screams at him killed me
My first Christmas video is from Markiplier!
Epic vid :D
28:43 I laughed so hard on that part
so were all watching rn??
OK, the comic strip are mostly to, like... Hide gore. After all, one of the endings, Vanny is torn to pieces. Plus, with there being multiple endings, it was do they could do something easier than 8 different ending cutscenes
for the true ending you must go to the old elevator idk where that is or how to get there but that's how you get the true ending
The terrible pacing of this game makes me nauseous. It seems like they were trying to make it more tense by making the time "pass" slower at the end, but it's just confusing to think about. Making my brain do the hurt
omg i am in stitches. 27:56 up until 29:15 is so funny.   mark screaming for Freddy. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 that scene has made my day.   and my christmas complete
That was so rushed lol
Freddy dies: Markiplier:You Bastard
The King has returned again and again and again and again and again and again
If you don’t make it to “the end” by 6 am without getting rid of moon man Gregory has a heart attack with which gives you the jump scare noise
No mark I won’t go away
Go look at trailer 1.  It plays out SO DIFFERENENT from the story as it is now!!
Did they just pull a COD zombies ending 😂
28:42 Oh god I can't stop laughing. That moment when you and your boyfriend are attacked by a killer and you turn around to find your boyfriend running away.
the panic for freddy is the best part of this whole series
Markiplier:,, A serious amount of actions that wouldn't cohinsinde with each other as someone would think." Me:,, You mean like the FnaF storyline ?"
Freddy, my baby. ;-;
i will only watch Mark play this because of how honest his criticisms are B)
mark: i know you, for some reason, enjoy my suffering. me: but are we the only ones mark?
Mark and Freddy have such a good love and hate relationship
28:41 omfg i cant stop laughing
IM DYING 🤣🤣🤣🤣  28:40
the fact that I've been binge watching this series all day and the 7th video came out literally just as I was finishing the 6th one
Freddy just running past Gregory chased by Monty at the end there and Mark screaming about it was HILARIOUS
it was so funny. when Markiplier screamed FREDDY, FREDDY YOU BASTERD!
27:53 *THIS* is the greatest chase I've ever seen, I literally cry laughed🗿
“Did they run out of budget” sadly sums up the entire game. The setting looks great, like I love the neon ascetics of the pizzeria but everything else feels like it was 65% done and then the game shipped
A perfect game played by an amazing man
FREEEDDDDYYYYY
28:42 Gregory:freddy help me!!  Freddy:bye have a great time!!
R/confidently incorrect
Gotta love Mark screaming for Freddie and Freddie just running right past him. That killed me.
This game is honestly kinda bad lmao
Plz do the cannon ending
Mark, in the kindest way possible, STOP SPAMMING THE DAMN SUMMON BUTTON. You are doing this to yourself.
You can most definitely tell they ran out budget during that death 💀
Finnaly i have been waiting all dam day
Freddy leaving was so fucking funny 😂😂
So…how’s y’all’s day ?
i think they ran out of time with a lot of the ending cutscenes (and other stuff), and will update them once the bug fixes are finished (the game was delayed multiple times and fans seemed to be getting a little impatient)
“Good news, it’s almost a cock!”
if your name is Vanessa you're in for a treat lol
I like how as soon as he realised he was being chased by Monty he started screaming and cursing at freddy and he was like "I ain't have in that" and runs straight past him
I really hope he discovers the Afton ending with Spring trap
28:43 Freddy passing mark is the most funniest thing I’ve ever seen😂😂
I’m loving the narration Mark does, taking a second to tell us the hell he’s gone through, and warning us that he’s been a bit of a dummy.
I literally DIED laughing when we was screaming for Freddy and he just wouldn’t come
nothin better than sec breach with mark at 1:23 am
MAAAAARK! You can't hide in the charging stations because the said they're all shut down since the restaurant's about to open, lmao, you goof.
If all of the endings are like the vanny one then i am so beyond disappointed . which is a shame because it looked so promising.
LETS GO 40 MINUTES AFTER THIS GOT POSTED
No one:  Mark passing the secret door: what's that big thing over there?
I wanted to go to sleep cuz of work but I’ll guess this won’t happen
Mark missed a pass in the theater
I love the moments where mark pauses and is like "yes I was stupid and I need to stop"
E
yeet
28:42 Freddy pulled the most treacherous move in Mark’s eyes: going the wrong way when he needed him most 😂
Ok, so there is a cannon ending that you can get if you stay in the mall. What you have to do is: Choose to stay at the mall  - Go to Montys Gator golf with the party pass  - Find the fazcam, the mazercize ticket, and the security badge  - Go to the daycare theatre and get the mazercise control key  - Use the mazercize control key to move the walls of the maze that are covering the vent   - Fight Monty   - Upgrade Freddy   - Go to the elevator shaft in Roxy raceway (There are barriers that you should be able to open with maxed out Freddy)  - Go down the elevator shaft  And the rest will be self-explanatory The ending that will happen if you follow these steps is considered by many to be the "Cannon" or "True" ending.   Also, if you take the head of the driver-assist bot in Roxy raceway at 6AM, it sets the time back to 5:15AM allowing the use of save stations and keeping the upgrades on Freddy
even with the upgrades its still the same
It's somewhat reassuring to see others are confused about this game. I've seen every ending and tried listening to theory and explanation videos on it, but I still have no idea what the hell any of this game is trying to do.
Well let's do vanny
28:37 This part made me laugh so hard lmao
I SAID TO MYSELF “Did they run out of budget?” IMMEDIATELY BEFORE MARK SAID IT IM WHEEZING
FREDAYYYYYYYY
Play Titanfall 2..
Can you do more finding bigfoot
Hey Mark beat all the arcade quest games
What kind of design is disabling saving entirely for the final act? really. Like, I'm enjoying watching Mark play this but the game design itself looks AWFUL.
OMG I"M NEVER THIS EARLY I FEEL SPECIAL, HIII <3
This game isn’t broken at all it works fine. A minimum of 50gb game that cant render the directory map and has 200 bugs and exploits
This may the most annoying fnaf
the fact freddy ran right past him when mark was calling him😭😭
It's okay mark...               *We love your suffering*
Trust me where to live vod be the last pace you vod look
Gregory: *in Freddie's suit*  Moon: "I'm gonna do what's called, a pro gamer move."
his pain is actually palpable, this poor man
344,733rd
there's seven different endings :)
Mark: Races through the game  also Mark: "How did I miss so many things?"
Mark: FREDDY!! FREDDYYYY!!! Freddy: casually waiting for Monty going down the stairs
Ik this ain't Fnaf related but...      *Yay tomorrow is Christmas :)*
Just letting you know mark to get the true ending you need to play all of the princess quest mini games
Family Friendly Horror Game even the endings XD
good news! it is almost a cock
Yaaaaaaasssssss
Hey mark, there’s a glitch that allows you to save after endgame, you might want to check that out to save your sanity
Freddie you bastard was the best bit haha
"You are my superstar." Fnaf, the least expected game to hit the feels.
Ahh finally its just not a fnaf game if Mark doesn't curse freddy out at some point
such a chill lets play but mark just keeps screaming all the time man, chill down bro its stressing
This is the earliest I’ve ever been
It says you have to go to the recharge station to activate the lights again so moon couldn't follow you
E
Here within an hour    |   V
As someone that has no clue about the lore, this game feels silly and unfinished. Some concepts were so good but on the other hand... oh geez
Fun Fact: There are 6 endings in the game :)
Moonman is the biggest cheater
Mark, here's something you should try (no spoilers): you might need Monty's claws to fight the robots, Freddy's hands probably won't work so try that
lol how did mark now we were early... 👀
MARK!!!! NOTICE!!!! You can pick up the racecar robot head again at Roxy Raceway, This unlocks the save function even though it's 6am.
Mark you need to remember their be game it had the bunny behind you
Mark you can save
shittiest fnaf ever
Finally I've been waiting for 3 hours for this vid
3:14 foxy
did he just guess the true ending, he said stay, get monty, true ending
Hi Mark
You were supposed to get Monty’s upgrade first
Why did they make Freddy so friendly and innocent in this game?? I’m over here feeling bad for him and everything…
Storywise its decent but when it comes to being as good as it shouldve in general...its awful
I am so early also tell matpat to de a theory about this
Ok but I'ma be mad if there ain't another part to this
There's 5 endings
*Sees kroc comming after him and he calls freddy* "FREDDY!!!"....*watches him run around and ignoring him * "FREDDY YOU B**ch!!!!"
IF U PEOPLE CANT BE NICE TO MARK, THEN SHUT YOUR MOUTH!!!
Finally I’ve been waiting all night at last I can watch the next part >:)
I'm fully invested in Five Night's at Freddy's and I'm strangely confused by it, and yet ok with it. Is that what happens??
"Glamrock freddy is like Gregory's dad!"  Freddy when he has to pay child support: 28:43
I knew instantly a few episodes back that mark would forget that Moon can get you at any point when he's active, even in freddy, and that the recharge stations were the only safe place against him but they are currently offline
Today, I got into a physical altercation with my dad - he apologized.  I am still angry, but watching these videos rly helps...Thank you, Mark. <3 Truly.
yall I think Freddy is scared of monty ngl
28:42 the way he just run past himXD
god, seeing freddy just RUN RIGHT PAST MARK AND MONTY,,,,
Dude… 340k views in 40 min… go Mark
this game was super not good and mark clearly wasnt enjoying most of it, with instructions being limited to nonexistent throughout nearly the whole game- glad hes decided to be done. hope they come out with an actual 'fnaf style' game if they decide to contribute more, since this is.. not it
BRUH I GENUINELY GOT SCARED AT FREDDY'S "murder" I WASN'T EXPECTING "Vanny" TO BE A SAD ENDING DAMN IT!
You should play and descover all of the endings
I’ve waited sooo long I was tempted to watch someone’s else video but I AM A DEDICATED MARKIPLIER FAN
This game is SO bugged and unpolished. You can tell a lot of people put a lot of passion into this game, for example, the scenery is stunning.  But like Markiplier said, its like it started out to be something different and changed along the way. I wish they had continued to delay this game instead of releasing it because there's so many issues and bugs that break the immersion to an otherwise really great game.
The amount of lore is just amazing, especially the lore about vennessa/vanny and how they connect to eachother
Oh hi Mark
Who the hell creates these bots they're so annoying i'm just trying to read comments and it is a frickin hell
I swear, I don't think Ive ever laughed so hard at one of marks vids, the last few minutes of this video are just absolute gold
i like how it instantly cuts to freddy getting slapped off a bridge then ripped apart, only then to instantly cut to gameplay, then instantly cut to a near muted comic strip of vanny getting murdered and freddy being emotional
Im semi early? IM NEVER EARLY..HI!
Well, freddy has always gone to the place were u pressed the summon button so its suggested when your being chased ,you stay still and hope
The endings are literally so disappointing :/
there is a place in Roxy Raceway that does gown the stairs and at the end of the hall there is an elevator with a gate in front of it, if you get all the upgrades you can enter the elevator for an ending.
Hi Mark
Tutorial: "Recharge stations don't work anymore" Mark: WHY DOESN'T THIS RECHARGE STATION WORK?
he is too good at the game
Augh that’s definitely my least favorite ending, like.. idk thats a real human being hes ordering them to tear apart, it gives me the shivers The other endings aren’t good, especially the ones where Freddy dies, but for some reason that one is the one that really rubs me wrong
28:40 I like this part when Mark is dependent of Freddy. When you needed him most, he zoomed past you. Get me in get me in. FREDDY! FREDDY YOU BITCH! FREDDY.
Bro mark just needs to go into the sink hole please to get the lore ending
no please i hope he does another one where he finishes i can’t live like this😭😭
FYI Vanny was bugged the entire game, she's suppose to appear if you stay in an area too long. Debug menu fixes this.
Hey Hey Heyyyy
The first 11 minutes is funny because Mark didn't read the instructions.
I immediately thought of red Harring from the cartoon A Pup Named Scooby Doo 🤣🤣
His panicked screams for Freddy XD
Mark your not done
POV: you got kicked in the stomach 17:58
They ruined Freddy in this latest patch LOL made it entirely too frustrating to watch Mark suffer like that :( even if he was Q spamming
I LOVE THIS I WANT MORE!!!!!!!
Freddy's battery: *low*  Mark: "nope, nonononono not today."
27:53 This is where the fun is starting 😂😂
im still confused
Is there 5 endings plus a secret one if you collect all golden plushies?
We revel in your suffering :)
I have that exact same foxy plush, that he collects in the beginning of the video. Lmfao
it's rabbit season
I was wondering why the video was only 30 minutes long, now I know why
Summary of this part is... rant on developers xD
Freddy: *is dying * Mark: *XD*
*Freddy dies*   Meanwhile...  Mark: ''Did they run out of budget for the last animation?"
Someone please tell markiplier how to get the true ending
Freddy Frarbar
why didn't you try the leave its also a comic thing
28:40 freddy running right past mark when he was SCREAMING FOR HIS LIFE with monty very nearly murdered me PLEASE
Mark is truly the king of Five Nights at Freddy's
You can just tell Mark thinks this game is dogshit but he has to play it. Hahaha
you can get a 3 star ending playing all 3 princess quest games !! the third one is in her lair at the very end
yes i love this content
YESS IVE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY FOR THIS
Sadly it's ending wether  we like or not 😭
I was surprised when i saw that this ep is only 30 mins LMAO Welp, time to wait for mark to get the true ending
You'll have to get the different endings if ya want to continue
man what a shitty way to end the LP. it really seems like the last part of this game wasnt nearly as thought out and well designed as the first half
God I hate how broken this game is, love Mark but this is sometimes a chore to watch with how bullshit the mechanics of this game are
SERIOUSLY OTHER COMMENTERS, BE NICE TO MARK!!!
wtf was that intro
Is Mark still gonna be playing Inscryption?
That end got me wheezing
this vid made me have mixed emotions mostley the fact my dogs kept fighting
finally thank you markiplier!
Hint Unlocked: There is a secret location ending. Look out for it.
I belive there are like 6 different endings! It would be cool if you hot them all :) I can't wait for the next video have a great day!
dam mark didn't come and find me i need friends so hurry up mark
this is getting addictive. thank you for entertaining us
The fact that mark laughed at the vanny ending when I thought he was about to blast in tears is so unexpected... ngl the last animation was so low budget😂
I dunno if it's been patched yet or not, but there is a cheaty way to create autosaves after 6am.  You play any of the playable arcade games and it'll save your game when you exit the cabinet (Monty Golf, Princess Quests and BB World all work for this).
i can see why this episode came out so late
not the homie
freddy: mark: freddy: mark: FREDDDYY
I love how he just screams like a little girl yelling Freddy
PLEASE THE PART WHERE FREDDY RUNS AWAY
OH MY GOD I'VE BEEN WAITING THE WHOLE DAY FOR THIS VIDEO AHHHHH I'M SO EXCITED
Freddy isn't broken it's working as intended they just dont want you to spam the button like you were doing. Freddy comes to the exact spot where you pressed the button and can only handle one of those requests at a time. he has never NEVER actively followed you when you were doing your constant presses in other episodes.
Listen. We all knew him constantly calling my dad would come back to bite him. They don't follow him. Glamrock Freddy is being overwhelmed by all of the calls and his programming (in the game, not in the universe) can only handle so many, so it just chooses one and sends him there. He cannot blame Freddy for that death. His impatient play style is what got him killed. TL;DR: Button mashing isn't always the solution and will get you killed.
MARK DON'T LEAVE US LIKE THIS PLS GET THE TRUE ENDING
hi
FRRREEEDDDDIIIIEEE YOU B!@$H
and nothing happened :|
Repeating 2 words 20 times and yelling… comedy everyone!
Ngl, I cried when Freddy got disassembled
Go to the underground the true ending you’ll find fnaf help wanted and you’ll have a boss battle springtrap
Freddy says he cannot leave but in one of the endings he does leave with Gregory
man freddy ain’t gonna find you if you keep moving away from the place ur signalling him to go
Does anyone else think that Freddy telling Gregory he was "injured" was a way for him to say that Vanessa was there and that he needed to hide? Cuz after he says he's taking Gregory to first aid and he hides, that's when Vanessa shows up.
I was dying when Mark is getting chased by Monty and Freddy just runs past him on the stair lmao
jumpscare list :)  3:33 - moon 7:28 - moon apparently? 10:45 - moon 12:23 - moon 27:53 - security bot 28:26 - security bot 29:13 - monty
If there is something i really love about markiplier is that he really knows how to make awesome fnaf thumbnails.
Freddy: Good news! It's almost a 🐓
they really hit us with a black ops 4 zombies ending cutscene
Mark is just so confused in this episode
I’m isolating atm and I’ve been waiting for this all day
Mark: FREDDY U B*** FREDDYYYYYY!!!!!    i cant 🤣🤣🤣🤣
please don't stop playing yet!! you can get monty's claws before you install roxy's eyes-- installing the eyes triggers the ending. you can play the princess quest game to get a different vanny ending as well. <3
"There are areas we have not investigated, lead the way superstar :)" The way he said this made him sound like an excited dad I'm gonna cry
Lol, not looking good for a part 8
i was waiting for this video all day
waiting for this all day ong
lol
I was sad up until Mark said *did they run out of budget for the animation?*   MARK YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE ME LAUGH DO YA!!!
yes mark. i am early. I’ve been stalking, waiting for the moment.
This game feels like so much has been cut, its kinda sand honestly, as of now the game feels kinda lackluster
''did they run out of budget for the last animation'' is mark rude LOL
Markiplier! You can pick up the driving assist head in Roxy’s raceway (for some reason) and you get saves back? I saw it on a stream idk if it works now
can't wait for him to get the true ending and just go "what, what, what the hell was that"
FrEeEEEeeEeEEddyyYyYYyyY!
Gregory was so scared the final vanny cutscene went 2D
stayed up for hours waiting for this
Never thought I’d be so early lmao
Judging from the old trailers, I feel like this game had a really different story than the one we got
This was the most painful video to watch orz Why not appreciate the good work the artists did on the ending with the comic?? Why SPAM Q?? (Probably because you don't know how it actually works) Why not do what the game tells you to do and go to the exit immediately,,,,,,, This was. painful
7:40 what happened in deed
Omg even the end credits look like shit. The team looks huge but the results are just a buggy half baked mess
Freddy just passing Mark when he called him multiple times is the funniest thing to me
28:40
From 28:16 to 29:24 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA XD!!!!!!!!! 🤣 😂 🤣 😂 🤣 😂 🤣 😂 🤣 😂
You chose the bad ending first
@22:34 there is a baby plush
When will you be doing more Inscryption???
The series started with a 50 min duration per episode, but now its a 30 min episode we need longer ones 🥺🥺💔
28:23 now this is the quality content I’m looking for
I want markiplier to get the true ending.
Wait does this mean he will be doing more of fnaf or not?
28:42 Mark: *about to die* FREDDY!!! Freddy: yeah I'm gonna go over here to Monty gimme a sec
The real ending takes a lot of work.
well that was terrifying
Mark, this video was extremely sad for you I honestly feel bad for you for having to play this game through
There is 6-7 different endings in the game
i really don't wanna be mean, but man this game just isn't good, i can't believe it's by the og dev, it needed a full cycle of playtesters to figure out what works and what doesn't :/
New episode, hooray <3
Anyone else patiently waits for markiplier to upload another clip of fnaf? 😂
If someone told me years ago that I would be rooting for Freddy in a FNAF game and would be heartbroken when he died, I would have thought it they were cuckoo but here we are.
Maybe you should get the Monty claws and then go back to the restricted area in Roxy raceway.
Great start to a video
This has gotta of been an open world game with some staged parts. Shame we didn't get that, some bad planning must of happened where only certain set pieces got in. Shame
Can someone do a counter on how many times the game told Mark what to do or that something was happening and he just didn’t listen then got angry that it was never explained
Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 37 minutes ago!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Freddy comes to the place you press the watch so if you run away from the place you called him over from them he won’t come to you
I'm kinda disappointed of the Vanny's end ngl 😐
Sad he didn't tell us wat he thought of the game
Look for Bonnie
Omg this is addicting
i gut in trouble and had to sneak to comment this comminting till i get noticed day 4 this sires is GREAT!!!!!
Mark:FREDDY YOU BASTARD Freddy: RUUUUUUUUUUN
Mark: *picks the stay option* Monty: "I do so not agree on that one, chief"
Early-ish :,D
the reason there's unused areas is because malls are big, if you need to get out you'll go to specific areas. Things like the fazbear theater would'nt have staff repair stations, animatronic parts or anything useful, so they are excluded from the storyline but are still there to add realisim
I don't enjoy ur suffering Mark i'm entertained by it. There is a difference. 🤣😂
There's supposed to be a glitch where you can pick up the robot head in Roxy Raceway again and the saves will re-activate while you stay.
mark go back to vanny and play the game arcade that is in vanny room and you will get and another ending
28:42 Was unintentionally hilarious
This really makes me wonder how much time past between the previous episode and this one.
Mark really knows how to kill all tension
im sorry for being early.
NOOOO don’t be done!! This play through deserves a proper ending! Please continue! I know you’re suffering but we enjoy it!! I mean uh… the game! we enjoy the game!! 🤣
dang man this new fnaf game is horrible lol
wait, so no part 8 or Part 8 with the other endings ? please tell me it aint over, im in love with all of this rn
It is almost a cuck? *blush*
Mark freaking out and yelling to get Freddy to get to him topped the vidoe off
Im so confused how the story works now
That ending was HYSTERICAL 😂😂 watching Freddy absolutely let you down was too funny and such a highlight of this gameplay experience 😂❤️
Oh my god when mark is being chased by monty and yelling for Freddy then he runs right past him…. FREDDYYYYY
15:02 this must've bugged or something, this entire part was honestly so jarring...
The way this vid has been out for 35 minutes and there already 6.9K comments lmao 😭😭
I really miss your fnaf vids and this new series the is great 👍
Mark: FREDDY HELP Freddy: “your free subscription of friendship has ended please pay for the full one”
Who else has been fully aware that other YouTuber’s have been much farther in the game for a WHILE, but watch Markiplier exclusively regardless?
Now i want a tiktok audio about the "don't make me laugh you've been shaking your ass for like half of the night" but with Marki screaming Vanessa
It's not your suffering specifically. We just enjoy the pain and agony of someone besides ourselves.
30:29 THAT WAS TOO SOON 😭 TOU DID HIM DIRTY
Famous words: Fredddyyyy!!!
Freddy at the end running past mark while he was being chased by monty so was hilarious
Mark having an absolute mental breakdown because of freddy has me dying...
Its never the end. There are many endings.
freddy running like a track star while mark is vulnerable and scared is quite entertaining
we need this more plz play more i wanna know the ending
The fact that this is PART 7 and each episode is over 40 minutes kinda shows why this game is 85 gigabytes lol
27:53 LOL This scene was great
7 seconds in and already laughing. Thanks for that.
12:23 that scared the absolute shit out of me
the scariest part of this game is that the employees have to be there at 6am.
Hello
FREDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!
He is wrong in so many ways The true ending he is way off
i feel so bad for mark at the end but i laughed so much
Freedy running past Gregory as Mark screams for him was single-handedly the most hilarious thing i've seen this month
I have feeling too Mark as many other creators who play fnaf alor or just join since it's out that this game may been rushed for the holidays, script delays, stuff maybe being pulled, bug testing not done right, or other stuff. This game seems good for a start but, still if this would be done again, the boss battles should be actual boss battle feelings, some were very good and some not so well, bug testing should be more extensive, and overall the story flow of the game should be fleshed out so we don't 6 and half endings mostly out of comic book strips. Will just wait and see, especially since may be rumors for a dlc but no clue. Will just see how the future turns out.
FREDDDYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!
Idk why but Mark yelling “Freddy you bitch!” Was so funny to me 💀
28:45 Top 10 Anime Betrayals
I did not expect the Vanny ending to be so abrupt. You say "sure we'll take on Vanny" and 2 seconds later freddie is being ripped apart and 3 more seconds and now Vanny is dead
i missed watching this when it was out for 2 minutes bc i was busy explaining the security breach fnaf lore
THANK U FOR MAKING ANOTHER VIDEO, SERIOUSLY HOPE YOUR OK MARK!! 😊 😟
Mark: FREDDY YOU LITTLE B!TCH- inserts Mark screaming for Freddy    I shouldn't have laughed that much
Mark: FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDDDDDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
freddycanberepairedfreddycanberepairedfreddy-
Love ur vids Mark!!!!!
You cannot find me if am in space... did u think about that lol ?
28:52   [Monty running down the stairs, trying to viciously murder Gregory]  Freddy: "oop- sorry, excuse me- can I squeeze past- sorry-"
it's vanny 😶
Mark btw you should try to go to Bonnie’s bowling inside Freddy and really explore that area there is some cool dialogue there. Anyways please keep trying to get all the endings and finding all the secrets too!
Remember:  There are six endings in FNAF Security Breach. All of them have a star rating, based on how difficult it is to get them (just like the star rating has worked since the first game in the franchise).
poggers
Freddy is a better father than Goofy
28:43 THE WAY HE SCREAMS FREDDY I CANNOT
Mark yelling for help whilst being chased by Monty: FREDDIE!!!!!!!!!!!! Freddie blankly staring off into the abyss, not paying attention to what’s going on.  Then sees Mark and Monty running and decides to join in too.😂😂😂
There is 7 endings in the game
Day 3 of asking markiplier to play kenshi   Kenshi is an singleplayer open world game with lore and an rpg aspect with base building while building your squad up from the ground up and you can play it in any style and you make your journey and the modding comunity is amazing by fixing things in the game that the devleoper has not done or enhancing the visuals or changing the way you play the game it is a very free open world game which you can easily spen hours in and I am commenting this in the hopes of kenshi becoming popular so the developers get more support and I do this becuase I am a huge fan of kenshi and its lore and while I cant cover all of kenshi and its glory I have lost hours playing kenshi thank you for reading and have a wonderful day.
This feels amazing like the old times
So...did mark just forget that theres a ton of different ways to get to the front door
2021 needed this game more than it cares to admit.
28:40  Freddy: I must go, my people need me.

His aggressive screaming at Freddy
I HAVE TO WAIT A WHOLE DAY NOW WHY
Mark: *literally screaming for Freddy as Monty chases him* Monty: Why the fck this bish calling for you Freddy:Uhhhhh idk
first
I’m so early and I love it
Ngl the endings are pretty dispapointing
Okay… can we just discuss the last 2 minutes of this video where he’s running from Monty and yelling for Freddie.. THAN FREDDIE PASSES HIM AND DOESNT TURN AROUND?!🤣🤣🤣
I, I just can't say this game is good. Like nothing has been explained in the slightest, that was the laziest ending I have ever seen, they try to make it out to some whole huge plot when it's literally just a fucking kid that stayed at the pizzaplex for (since there's no explanation) no reason, with Freddy for some reason just, deciding to help him. Like there's not a bit of any type of story told here except for the little bits in the messages and those have like very miniscule information. Like I was so adamantly waiting in them to at least say what the fuck Vanessa's deal is but we don't even get that.
Please hurry up with the videos I love the seires
Find all of the princess quest arcade machines.
Ive had fun watching Mark play this, but this game is SUPER flawed. However, there have been many fun moments
Funny how you didn't even press the Stage Button when Vannessa told you something "was" there. Lol you just never used your face to notice it lol
seeing on the save slot that mark played this morning and came out with the episode in the same day is the best. dude really did all this to give us an episode every day
Yes.
Mark screaming, running for his life so he doesn't lose half an hour of progress. Meanwhile Freddy: "I think I'ma go on a little jog, oh hello Monty, you know what, I'll wait my turn"
that wheeze he released after seeing freddy's death scene made me lose it
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍😍😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣

More Inscryption episodes please :(
what a disappointment of a game.
i cant wait for the comp where its just mark screaming at freddy
IIIIIIIII"m dying insiiiiiiiide waiting for moooooore Inscryption. But here you aaare feeding your FNAF addiction.
Game: Tells Mark that all Recharge Stations are offline Mark: Immediately deletes that information
The game isn't perfect but my god he's so bad at it.
"...Or I will come find you. I will find you. I will find you..."  What, like you found your way out of that laundry room?
perfect timing like always mark <3
Only 30 minutes?? Really?
Freddy : is dying Mark: INTENSE LAUGHING
Claim your here before 1 million views ticket here  🎫 👇
good news it's almost a cock
Oh no. Here I go, agreeing again!
I can’t be the only one in who thinks mark isn’t having fun at all right?
I've never clicked so fast on a video I hope Mark plays it to get all the upgrades and plays all the games to get the true endings of the game
28:41 Betrayal
Freddy comes to the place you summoned him, not where you are.
i cried.  this isnt funny. HES A ROBOT
He needs to find all endings
yes!!
Markiplier:gets Chased to death by Monty Also Markiplier:FREDDYYYYY  Freddy:Runs Away from Mark with super speed
Waring  Waring  Waring  Waring  Waring :this is help for the 3 star ending if you want it     play the arcade game in the security office in the vanny ending.
the way that freddy ran past mark when he was getting chased by monty💀💀💀💀 lmfaoooooooooo
So this is the ending mark had
Shit mark was clueless in this episode lol
NOO FREDDY :( wow im actually kinda feeling like crying
Mark: Repeating “Are you serious?” a billion times  Siri: “And I took that personally”
I just want to say that when you were running from that big dj or something somewhere near there or on the map is a game you can play on one of the things its called princess something idk bht ive see. it just wanted to let you know bc its a secret
GOOD NEWS IT IS ALMOST A COCK
Acording to the lore of this game its now canon that Morty killed Bonnie.... I wanna rip and tear that crocodile/aligator in half
Leeeet's goooo come on it's 1am here in Greece and I need to see that before I go to sleep
*“You are… my superstar.”*  I’m not crying, you’re crying.
mark: laughing as the end cards roll me: *bawling my eyes out because freddy is gone*
From what I've seen Mark, you are completely right. The game is incredibly half-baked, glitchy and uninteresting for the most part. One could even call it a failure. The developers are aware of it, as they've stated that a lot of content had been cut to make the game playable on release date.  This resulted in most players experiencing the same ending you have (Leave/ Disassemble Vanny) which are simultaneously the most straight-forward to achieve, as the game seems to be steering you into them, as well as most underwhelming.  Just look at the fact that there is barely any lore or missions in such a vast and detailed map and Vanny's approx. 6 minutes of screentime.
Mark: FREDDYYYY *_SCREAMING_* Freddy: Hmm wonder if thats important
part of it is probably because scott retired halfway through
Mark: Continues to call for Freddy Freddy: *Runs Past*
There’s other endings Mark
28:42
Me: *literally cries cuz Freddy died* Mark: Did they run out of budget for the Last animation? Me:... MARK THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SAD OKAY!!??
we need fnaf sb custom night
14:27
Markpilier getting chased by monty and calling out to freddy, then him running straight past was one of the funniest moments of this series
28:42 this is the funniest shit i've seen all day I swear 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Freddy running past Mark when Monty was chasing him is sending me to orbit
Mark you called freddy when you were upstairs and when you went down you didn't call him until he was going up and congrats on getting an ending but there are multiple endings
*mark calling for freddy* FREDDDAYYYYY!!!!!! *freddys approaches mark* OH THANK GOD FREDDY! *freddy zooms past him* NO FREDDAYYYYY!!
him getting chased by monty was a whole scooby doo chase scene
Mark trying to call Freddy throughout this video was absolutely hilarious
Anyone else not watching any speedruns or similar stuff cuz he wanna finish the game with markimark
The way freddy kept running away from you 💀
I swear there were hiding places ehen monty was there
Mark: Maybe there was an issue in development  Like Scott getting canceled? That's what immediately comes to my mind, at least
Mark you were supposed to do the 3rd princess quest that's how you get the true ending
YAY
why can moon kill you inside Freddy ?????
I am early this was posted like 35 minutes ago thanks for noticing
Mark: "I will come find you" Me, checking my door to make sure it's locked and seeing it isn't: "Uh oh..."
Wow this game is rough
Me: emotionally crying Mark: *did they run out of budget for the last animation?*  * laughing *
Talking Rolling Shutter Door... we're your Superstar 🥺
9:26 That sounds _really_ suspicious. But not for the reason you think...  I'm just saying... it sounds like she should be offering you candy if you know what I mean...
Freddy not being able to coop with Mark and Mark getting mad at him was probably the best part
Markiplier go to the the bonnie bowling ice cream area while you are inside freddy you get a "Lore voiceline" :)
27:55 best part 😂  FFFREEEEEDDDYYYYYY!!!!!!!
i love how mark was laughing while i bursted into tears
Mark: FREEEEEEDDDYYYYYYYYYYY! FREEEDDDDDDDDDY! FREDDY YOU BASTARD!! ME: - dying-

Freddy: "Nothing can hide from me now!" Also Freddy: *Runs into random rooms because he can't find Mark*
You can hear freddy just looping the whole map XD
good news! it is almost a 🐓
I keep seeing that when somebody keeps RAPIDLY hitting Q to call Freddy he goes in different directions reason that is cause the PLAYER KEEPS MOVING!!! If you want Freddy to come to you, just simply STAND STILL!!!! (Unless you get spotted find a secured safe place to call him)
This game is generally good, but I feel like they're missing a lot of in-betweens? How did Gregory get stuck in the Plex? There were disappearances, at this specific location? When did the characters figure this out? Did Mark cut that scene out, or miss it, or did they forget to just... put in certain cutscenes????  Like, this is more the outline of a plot, not a written draft.  I don't care about the information itself. The problem is that the characters were never shown receiving information to lead to such revelations. And there were no moments that showed a narrative break between the viewer and the character, so there never was space for them to learn it without the player.
That sniff mark did at 0:57 was cute 🥺
BRUH
i like how he shares his opinion with us thanks Mark!!!
This game is such a disappointment man
You have clearly descended into madness. Man, this game just takes away the save and literally makes everything harder at the end. Wowzers! Though that scene with the bots destroying Freddy was really scary. Like I was so thinking he would just be an endoskeleton with most of his parts destroyed. Clearly did not happen.
Freddy: You are…my superstar Me: *Sad noises* Mark afterwards: wHeEzE
I want to be able to save in the end game
FREDDY! FREDDY! STELLAAAAA!
I wonder whose bright idea it was to disable saving after 6.
markiplier: FREDDY DONT WAIT YOUR TURN! Freddy: but its polite.
HOPE YOUR ALRIGHT TOO MARK, AND HAVE A NICE NIGHT!!!
FREDDY!!!!!!!!!! - Mark 2021
Damn so is Mark not going for the other endings?
freddy's death was supposed to be deep and dramatic but Mark wheezed and i lost my shit
brooooo the url link says bruh in it lmaooo
I came at the right time, 37 min ago!
Mark: Freddy! *Freddy runs past Mark* Mark: Freddy you bitch!  lol
I love you mark you the best (not romanticly)
If you spam the freddy summon button while moving it is going to send him to the previous spot where you were thats why he skipped you like that when monty was chasing you
Ayyy I was waiting for thisss
When the FNAF game is so bad Markiplier isn’t even bothering finishing it.
Dont know if Mark hates those Cautions dudes or likes them
You have to wonder whether Mark getting confused every step of the way is a let's player issue or a game issue 🤔 Am I crazy or is this Security Breach not really that streamlined gameplay-wise
33 mins Late! That's new
If you stay  Disassemble monty   head to roxy raceway  Then the ending should be there
...the vanny ending is so damn lazy WHAT
mark please continue and find secrets this series cannot end
33 mins ago let's goooo
Plis can mark go to the Bonnie place with Freddy and see how sad he comes
Mark.... Just Mark. You should so find the other endings. xD
FRREEDDEEYYYYY
28:35 I couldn’t stop laughing and I’ve never heard Mark scream like that
Im early but havent got to this part of gameplay soo bye
Mark still has it
Lol. Looking forward to the real ending
Not me just watching the prev and looking for a new vid....Thanks Mark!
When Freddy ran past Mark I almost pissed myself laughing LMAO

the "you are my superstar" absolutely destroying everyone Mark : aggressive laughter
I am not crying no I’m not i am not crying nope 🥺
The theater is coherent with the Monty golf option. Many things as well depend on what story you pick. There are different ways to the end depending on if you do the Fazar blast or Monty golf.  When you do fazar blast it connects to Chica in the kitchen and Bonnie bowl but when you do Monty golf it connects to the theater and Roxy raceway. It's all mostly the same game only things are switched and certain characters parts get taken before others
There is alot of endings, are you gonna get them all?
Do the other ending get montys item and go to roxxy raceway and then something something afton and some thing something molten freddy

no because i haven't watched anyone else play this yet, and I've been trying to avoid spoiler tiktoks, so when that "you are my superstar" line came, I physically fell off my bed and started violently sobbing
mark: ...FREDDDDYYYYYY!! YOU BASTARD!  freddy: **running around trying to find mark as he keeps running from the spot he calls him to**
Mark screaming “FREDDY” at the top of his lungs killed me 🤣
That ending of today episode had me crying with laughter. FREDDYYYYYYY!!!
28:40 man how Freddy just ran by XD
Pls do a next part!:)
FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY YOU BASTARD
not me screaming freddy when he wasn’t getting there quick enough in the final chase there with monty
33 minute crew
What did vanny even do
there are a bunch of different endings. The dissasemble vanny one was only one of them.
There's more endings. You can escape December revenue
Freddy waiting for his turn is the most funniest thing ever. He's so gentlemanly and a little bit british
Yo
Will Mark realize that Freddy goes to the exact position where he is called? ...nah
HOPE U DONT LOSE YOUR PRETTY VOICE MARK, AND I'VE BEEN WAITING TO BE FOUND BY U!!!
Top 10 anime betrayals
So is that all for the series of security breach or no ????
It didn't help that you kept moving mark, freddy had kept changing his path to compensate
is it weird that my eyes started to water when friend quote passed. I started to like him
Mark yelling “FREDDY!!” so frantically while he gets chased by Monty who just doesn’t care was somehow both extremely intense and extremely funny
You got the worst ending 💀
22:33 completely missed that baby plush
*Seeing Freddy run past Mark, it fills you with Determination. Hp fully restored.
I’m sorry but that last sequence of mark just frantically yelling for Freddy made me laugh my ass off
Freddy: You are my super star… Mark : *has an asthma attack*
I found it hilarious when Freddy just walked by him when he was getting chased by Momty
Keep em’ COMIN w the videos!
For the true ending go to roxy raceway and go "down" in the digsite, or what other people call the elevatorshaft or the sinkhole Reminder that you are going to need the monty claws
Mark: FREDDIEE FREDDIE!!  Freddie: Hey look it’s monty !
”You are my superstat” brb cryin
freddy goes to the position you first call him, then  the next and the  next. Which is fine when you are running in a straight line, but when you are running all over the place and continue pressing the button it gives him a lot of places to go to first. At least that is what appears to be happening
Mark: literally about to die on steps and trys to call freddy  Freddy:comes to mark but passes him  Mark: freddy you bitch  Me:dieing 🤣
What?
Markiplier could u please make a part 8 about leave if u don’t mind
Markiplier 30:10 "Im gonna come find you"  Me: "Mark knows where I live, Oh sh*t Mark knows where we all live"
I like how markiplier forgot it said that (all) of the chargers were disabled and yet he still tries to use the charger like I know that was last episode but come on
The ending 💀
If YouTube doesn’t work out for mark. He’s now an expert at fixing the eyes on robots.
Freddy was just patiently waiting his turn
I wonder if Mark knows he has to play the princess quest games in the right order to get the true ending.
“FREDDY DONT WAIT YOUR TUUURRNN!!!!”
bro just chose to go through the worst ending ever☠
Did i just cry watching freddy die? Yes, yes i did.
That end of the video was hilarious. Mark Freddy comes to the location you called him (as in where you were stood when you hit the button) watching freddy run to every call location as Mark screams FREDDY made things much worse
So it is the end ?
I been waiting and checking for this video all day
Been waiting all day for this episode! Thank you Mark!
Seeing Freddy run past mark was hysterical, i laughed so dang hard on that part man. Also, i think they changed Freddy to go to the first location you call him and respond to the other ones in the order you called, but i dunno. Nice vid man, can't wait for tomorrow!
Mark jokes about coming to find people but like, imagine how many people would be either like 1) “ew who tf are you” 2)Omg it’s Markiplier!!!!!!!!WOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWW  3)whats up dude! Want a beer?
Impressive
Freddy wtf
Mark shouting at Freddy while Freddy just runs past him is always going to be so funny to me. 😂😂
32 mins and we at 6k comments girl
Hi mark! want the canon ending yiu should watch cory’s video! (Part 7 i think)
Please the ending is so funny😭😭😭😭
What if for the vanny ending vanessa found Gregory crying
To be honest, the no saves after 6am is such an stupid idea that i don’t even know how it got past testing
Freddy is a little confused :/
already
Aight
There's a glitch that allows you to save the game after 6am. If you go to Roxy Raceway and go to where the driver assist head was, there's another one you can pick up and it sets the time back to 5:15am so you can save again. Makes the game a lot easier and less stressful.
Markiplier just so you know you have a choice to either believe in Jesus or not Romans 10:9 forever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved repent from your sins we still have time but not a lot you decide whether you want to go to heaven or heck
Mark: FREDDY FREDDDDDYYYYYYY I NEED YOUUUU FREDDDDYYYYYYY Freddy: cya ima go eat something
Way to get Freddy killed Mark.
I guess there's no point in asking for more inscryption before he finishes this
Better complete the whole series mark you have to and can't back out of it.
I being waiting for this video all day 😩
Hearing marks voice with Bluetooth headphones is like asmr
Mark you need to play the 2 princess quests then pick vanny at the end and run up to her hideout and play princess quest 3, beat it and I think Vanessa was cursed or sumthin but when you win she is free and you leave with her. And people are saying the princess is vanessa or sum. Also there is a glitch to save after staying so you can get montys claws and go so the secret ending .
Mark: *I know for some reason you enjoy my suffering*  Shit, he's onto us!
hopefully mark gets the good ending!!!!!!!
watching these super dark videos on full brightness is draining my phone battery 😭
the elevator music from this game is so epic i need like a 10 hour loop of it
there's muilple endinigs
monte:HEY LITTLE GUY! *starts running* Mark:FREDDY! *freddy runs past mark* mark dies
Does he do freddys voice?
For anyone wondering, the quickest way to the front exit is taking the elevator back up to the atrium, then taking the elevator there down to the entrance.
I was dying laughing at the end of this omg XD
Oh my God literally an hour ago no one was here but now everybody's here
Me casually watching fnaf markiplier FREDDY FREDDY FREDDY
MARK PLS U HAVE A PARTY PASS JUST GO TO MONTY GOLF AND BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF HIM I BEG
Someone needs to totally make a complication of mark yelling at freddy 🤣
i swear dude im freaking dying at Mark losing his absolute shit over freddy not going to rescue him
Heck yeah! This episode was so good!
Ok mark has so much more to do😭 he’s like touched the surface level of everything in the game.
FREDDY YOU BASTARD
commenting on the game development... like.. did  you not know that Scott retired with this due to social media backlash -_- he probably wanted it one way before Steel Wool Studios messed with things too
Well that ending was underwelming hope the other ones dont have that artstyle or are atleast a litle bit better
mark screaming freddy at the end made my entire night.
I love how almost every video of this series has Mark suffering on a section of the game, I've enjoyed every second of it, maybe I'm turning sadistic
Noooo shortest episode so far D:
was watching part 6 when this video came out, was gonna squeal but remembered little brother is asleep next to me
Mark, here's a tip since you have a LOT of trouble with the S.T.A.F.F. bots: You CAN actually shoot the bots with the Fazerblaster. You just need to do it directly in the eyes. Once you do that, you have about 4-5 seconds to get away from them, before they start roaming around again.
Hi Evelynn
28:40 BRUH
Mark: "picks vanny" Me, whose already seen every ending:.   P A I N
Freddy betraying mark was the funniest shit ever
wooo woo were earlyyy
the whole freddy and monty bit was hilarious
i swear to god mark doesn't pay attention to what games say and legit it bites him in his ass
The way Freddy ran past Gregory when Monty was chasing him had me dying 🤣🤣
Why does it say " in your dreams" on the broken staff bots. Also they have teeth and they seem to have drawn on tears themselves . What?
Wonderful! Great quality and wonderfully making me be on the edge of my seat
Hope he tries to get the other endings... Cool vid tho
Mark: **calls Freddy** Freddy: "Nah mate, I ain't dealing with that shit"
Just by this video being short, I can tell that  he just ended
More SB videos from Markiplier is what I sit waiting for every day
That's it!? But you barely did anything ughhhhhh
Markiplier always makes my day
I think the Vanessa line in the elevator about the main stage was supposed to be from after he didn't leave. Probably circumvented the "proper" way out by accident xD
Hi
absolutely no one:            ...         markiplier: FREDDY COMERE BOY
Take a shot every time our dear Markiplier *shouts* FREDDY!! this episode...
I KEPT CHECKING YOUTUBE WAITING FOR THIS UPDATE FINALLY
WOOOOOOOOO
Each part Mark uploads of this series I get more and more excited!!!!!!🥳
28:09 FREDDYYYYYYY
Mark: “FREDDY I NEED YOU” Freddy: “I got shit to do soz lol”  (Also love how he casually walks back down with Monty like two golf dads catching up)  Time stamp 28:40
"FREDDYYYY YOUUUU BASSTAARDDD"
Cool vid
Earky
Game: Shows Vanny clearly for the first time  Me: Oh no. She's hot!
The way the Freddy call works I'm pretty sure is it doesn't make him go to you, just the location that you were at. So you called him further back and then ran, and recalling him doesn't override the previous call, so instead it's set up In a way of he now has 6 places to go to, rather than the most recent call
There's a whole nother level underneath the basement area, look it up since getting there might be a bit complicated, I'm not 100% sure myself
Freddie's summon is definitely a love it or hate it mechanic. Even before the patch he will run to where you pinged to then stop. He will not acknowledge any other call command until he has completed the first. So if you move from where you called him you have to wait till he stops then call him to your new location. Hiding is your best bet at being in a set location instead of running around trying to escape whilst Freddie fails to catch up with you.
next part you need to try to find the springtrap secret
Wait till he finds out there’s 7 endings 🌝
Wow I am actually here within a day of the video release
new drinking game: take a shot everytime Mark yells for Freddy
*Mark/Gregory calling Freddy*  Me: Lol
hello markiplaier i am your fan greetings from colombia
NOT FREDDY BEING A BACKSTABBER 💀
those first 8 seconds made my day
Hey Mark! You probably won’t see this but I’m currently really sick and every time you upload I’m excited out of my mind. I’ve loved watching you play SB and it’s been nice to listen to your commentary to this hell of a game while trying to get better. Anyways, I love your stuff and you always manage to make so many people smile with every video… Keep it up and Happy Holidays :} Thank you
Mark I figured something out when your being chased chica and it makes that ching noise it means that she has teleported closer
Yes mark my kettle also broke when Freddie died
You should try to beat the other endings
Is markiplier still the king of fnaf?
the way freddy just zooms past mark as he’s running for his life from monty is the most painful thing ever
Mark: FREDDY!!! Freddy: Don't worry buddy I'll sa- OOH LOOK A QUARTER.
That... awkward moment you're watching Mark watch a thing that may or may not be able to get him only for it to jump and get him... and you jump, slapping your wireless mouse that hits the wall then scares the shit out of the dogs under it.
Mark screaming for Freddy is so funny hsbsnsndjenx
God this video was amazing I can’t wait to see the next one
Only 30 minutes 😭 cmon I literally wait all day for this and we only get a 30 minute video... i dont mean to complain but ughhh gotta wait a whole nother dayyyy
Alternative Title: *Mark making theories and slowly losing his mind*
I was dying when Freddy passed you and the gator 😂😂😂
Freddy:Suffering   Markiplier: wtf (chuckles)
omgg finally early
I think Vanessa just foreshadowed what became of Greg. I'm still gonna believe Greg  becomes the security guard in FNAF 1.
Waited all day for this
this wasnt edited my lixian?
Markiplier don't keep us in the dark again please 💔💔
I love has mark just gets pissed at freddy just for walking off
Mark didnt realize that Freddy in the vanny ending already had all 3 upgrades somehow. Also you can save in the stay option by going to roxy raceway and picking up the driver head at the spot where your originally found it. This puts the game back at 5:15 and as far as I know it doesn't break anything by doing that.
man poor freddy didn't know where to go lmao
I hope he plays again, i know the bugs can be so annoying but this game is so important :(
Mark: "I'm the king of FNAF" Also Mark: literally doesn't read when the 6 am escape prompt shows up and tells him that the recharge stations won't work this time
I lovethat mark is screaming bloddy murder trying to call freddy, and he ends up WHOOSING right past him!
….whos gonna tell him theres 7 endings
This is the earliest I’ve been to your videos
Freddy making this difficult to watch 😭😩
finished watching part 6 and part 7 just comes out straight after, this is great luck
A 🐓
freddy: *tells mark exactly what to do* mark: “what do I do?”
Oh man that took forever to upload poor freddy though :(
Mark there are other endings depends on what you do.
First people here today I got on right as it was published
I love how mark is just amazing in every way he was all my child hood made it even better for me  he is nice and so sweet like candy 🤍
YEEEESSS
I feel like as the game progresses nearer to its ending, it’s quality also drops according to it. Like half the time I find it complete bullshit to what is happening both in terms of glitches and the story itself. Just me?
There is a secret ending with the princess arcade game if you play 1 to 2 to 3 In order
the rage for freddy screwing up to come save him is hilarious
AAAAAAAAAH NOOOOOOOO EPISODE ALREADY OVER?
Mark and his brain skills are fun to watch.
Freddy walking past Monty had me dying
Not the comic strip endings. 😭 I know Mark. WhY?!? Probably budget issues lol.
Mark: “Vanny” Freddy: *fucking dies*
Mark will find me? Ok!
So yes you r right the cool ending is related to "something down there draining energy" as u already rode in the lore messages in the game. The only requirement is having Freddy fully upgraded. Also, the path you need to follow is behind a door located somewhere in the raceway area.
There’s a global pandemic going on outside, my dad is watching The Weather Girls on TOTP, and I’m crying over a fictional, once-murderous, teddy bear. Life is a concept. Goodnight.
Let's see if he can figure out how to get the true ending
As much as i love FNAF, this game is soo confusing. So much bugs and stuff. Id prefer the old style game.
Finally. I’ve literally been waiting all day for this
FREDDY
Credits: In memory of our friend Mike Hoffman  Me: It’s nice to see that their honouring their frien-       how did Mike Hoffman die
I love markiplier, this has nothing to do with the video, i just saying i love him.
Both my brother and I have been watching this entire thing. It's so entertaining and markiplier just makes it so much better
I look forward to these videos every second WIKHAYAYAYAA
Honestly Mark did not seem to enjoy this Thame as much as the previous ones, I don’t really blame him tbh a lot of the design choices are very frustrating and the endings aren’t very satisfying
bastard freddy
Hi @Markiplier, i wanted to let you know that there is like 6 different endings you can get in this game, the ending you just got is one of them,  the destruction ending. the 6 endings are bad ending, good ending, true ending (which includes afton) , unmasked ending, hero ending, and destruction ending
I love that Mark doesn't pay attention to anything that the game tells him. Just making the game harder for himself.
talking it as mark doesn’t like freddy
The game is a buggy mass
I set up a whole pillow fort just to watch this
I like watching mark but- watching this just isn’t it 😂
this game has some of the weirdest choices and i'm honestly really disappointed
🐥
FREDDYYYY!!!!! omg i cant hahahaha. I laught so hard danggg
Freddy be like sighs* fine I guess you are my super star, come here
19:12 Mark gets very expressive with his hands when he's laying out a plan.
Best intro to date, no question.
I HATE THE VANNY ENDING IT ALMOST MADE ME CRY :((
The elevator music is the same as the "shift complete" music from sister location. Lore or easter egg?
" there you are you ASSHOLE "😭😭😭 bro was stressing w/ freddy
Inscryption
5 second off now 5 min ahhaha
ALL JUMPSCARES! <SPOLIERS> 10:40 -moondrop 12:20 -moondrop 27:50 -security S.T.A.F.F bot 28:20 -security S.T.A.F.F bot 29:10 -monty
Freddy is so broken it’s hilarious
One day we'll be looking back at this for nostalgia
I feel like the game was changed for some reason when Scott left and now the series might go toward a downward spiral since the main mind left the franchise.
Freddie, the ultimate betrayal
man he knew i have never clicked the links
I think Mark continuously pushing the button to summon freddy to the last known coordinates is what ultimately doomed him. Hahahaha.
I haven’t been this early to an upload since [REDACTED]’s daily videos
I’m pretty sure Freddy is summoned to wherever you clicked not to you specifically
Yo there are many other endings to reach
i absolutely loved the “FREDDAYYYYYYYYYYY NO DONT WAIT YOUR TURN”
I hope he does more for the other endings.
I hope markiplier makes another part for the true ending
I'm kinda late
ahhh ur so close to the end
28 MINS AGO??.. BRO WTF HOW AM I SO EARLY ? (Also mark, you doing these fnaf playthoughs are AWESOME, so keep up the good work and all that! Also, merry christmas :D)       I know it's not Christmas yet but there's no harm in wishing an early one, it's only 2 days away
28:35 FREDDY!!!! 😆 The Ai in this game… oh how amazing 10/10 Have a merry Christmas everyone
Sorry, im 30 mins late guys!
lol the "Aaahhh" from the signs XD
died in the last part bahahahah
YES PART SEVEN YAAA
the beginning edit is great, save time
The Vanny ending is basically BO4 zombies if you know you know
28:42 top 10 anime betrayals
cussing out freddy since 2014
FINALLY
Not mark calling me out at the beginning for being early to the video 👀
Hey .mark there is a spring trap ending try to get it
18:07 THIS HAD ME DEAD
It itches me that mark ended the last episode where he did It’s also the fact he didnt take THE MAIN STAGE ELEVATOR
Strange such a pizzaplex, a complex, is called a facility
NO IT CANT BE OVER ALREADY 💔💔 PLEASE
I understand because of names and stuff but seriously what kind of name is vanny
Omg damn you Freddy haha
I totally agree at 25:44 . I think development was rushed right near the end because they wanted it out before christmas. The environment is usually made first and then gameplay and then the storyline (usually). So the environment is really cool, the gameplay is really good in certain moments but unpolished and then the storyline is a bit janky.
“FREDDAAAAAAYYYYYYY”  -Mark, 2021
freddy running right past mark while he’s screaming is the funniest thing ive ever seen
0:00-0:08 is the best ngtl!
I imagine spamming the call button screws with the mechanics of the game. Did that thought EVER cross Mark’s mind??
I think there is about 6 endings I hope you’ll be able to find them 😅
I can’t with the end of this. he’s just screaming for freddy while trying to run away from monty and failing completely
This is not the end
I am not sure if you will see this but Freddy goes to where you were when you called him if you move he won't move to your current spot he will move to your previous spot.
Freddy just walking up the stairs when mark was screaming for him😭😭
Very spoopy
0:05  My gf be like
28:43 I lost it when Freddy ran past mark 😂
FrEdDy YoU bAaaaaaaaaaaaaStArd!!!¡¡¡¡
That intro made me cackle 🤣
This game looks really cool but also is glaringly unfinished and bugged to all hell, this shit deserves a GIANT Early Access sticker on Steam.
Thank you mark for posting, i haven't had the best day, my sisters been yelling at me for no reason then the adults started to also, ilysm mark thank you for making my days better ♡
sucky wucky
Guys the day and night animatronics have a different finger count
Mark said what we were all thinking about the end…I felt some sort of rage when I found out it was just a comic strip
Gg,new banging video !
heheh early by 27 minutes >:)
Niceee
I love how Mark is so desperate of Freddy
Mark there are 6 ending's
I probably died of laughter when Freddy ran away up the stairs like that and Markiplier started screaming
i waiting all day for this..
Freddy running straight past Mark leaving him to die to Monty at the end was the best
Gosh watching this series is addicting
I hope he gets the true ending
“what happened”
i think mark got a mental breakdown from freddy the last 5 min of the video 😂😂
mark i love these videos🙂
wasn't ready for "GOOD NEWS! IT IS ALMOST A 🐔"
Take Freddy to Bonnie bowling and get into home
Mark's punishment for obnoxiously calling Freddy every five fucking seconds: Freddy no longer coming to him when he calls.
Not me stalking my notifications for him to upload the next episode
Yes mark. We *do* enjoy your suffering. Why else would we be here?             This is a joke I don’t mean it plz don’t kill me
FREDDY WHY
yEsSSssSS the pArT 7
I love his interpretation of the vanny red herring ending
WHEN FREDDY LITERALLY RAN AWAY FROM HIM WHILE MONTY WAS CHASING HIM
"You are my superstar..." DONT MIND ME WHILE I SOB HYSTERICALLY
would love to see you get all 6 endings
there’s like 5 endings.. the best one is where you choose the vanny option and play the third princess quest.. you do have to play all the princess quest games tho
FrEdDyYy
I think I just got covid again      *ah shit, here we go again*
all i feel is existential pain
I was waiting all day for this video😭
That fast :(
Freddy= *Dies* Gregory= *Sad* Mark= *Laughing*
Awesome part! I’m crying tears of joy
Mark is laughing at the Freddy death ending. Wow. If he gets hate for that, then...
video out but im tired i will make review when i wake up tomorrow and watch
have you read the fnaf books
11:40 Siri kept popping up on my phone when he was saying that
freddy:dies Me:about to cry Mark:laughing so hard
Cant wait for the bait for more nothing,
17:09  Mark doesn't know this, But a majority of the endings are in a comic book style, So that was intentional.
Hi i like ur video
18:00 I thought the exact same thing, wich is sad :(
Your my dad, woogie woogie woogie!
Hello.
Was anyone else screaming at Mark that the recharge stations can't be used in the last hour?
Rest in pieces Freddy :(
Not me wanting to cry when Freddy said “you are my superstar”
Indeed I am early.
Mark literally guessed the entire route to get the real ending
to get the real ending you have to find springtraps room witch is way under the megaplex at the old  fnaf 6 loaction
Mark losing it at the end is the funniest thing I have seen🤣🤣🤣
LMAOOOO WTF HAPPENED
MARK. IT SAID THE RACHARGE STATIONS WERE OFFLINE IN THE POPUP. YOU NEED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION, THIS ISN'T FUNNY.
29m
mark: u sprint a bit but ur not that fast moon: **instantly kills mark**
Why...why was the last animation a comic book-
Mark's reaction to the ending was most definitely not what i expected, but at the same time i needed it.
Mark: You sprint a bit but not that long.  Moondrop: *Are you sure bout that?*
what an intro
THE BETRAYAL OF FREDDY AT THE END OMG
honestly i cant even tell if this game is glitchy or glitchy xD
Im so attached to freddy,he's so polite and friendly in this game
i waited the whole day
Mark u tried go back to bonni
Hey mark since im so early, i just wanted to say, i look up to you. Thank you for providing me this entertainment over the years. Your my favorite yt, and if you see this, could you try responding. It would mean alot. Thanks mark.
“what are you doing here you’re early” first time being early and i get called out on it???
GOD THIS GAME S U C K S
I’ve never seen mark scream at Freddy this much since the earlier games and this time he’s not even supposed to be killing mark
E
You know the game is bad when mark himself says the budget of the game is lacking.
THIS IS SO EXCITING
Game: Literally outlines what is going on.  Mark: I'll just ignore that
im starting to think that freddy doesn’t like u
Is vanny human?????
last time i was this early roxy still had her eyes
I cant believe you made a video on my birthday 🥺. Ur so nice
Yo mama
Hearing Mark scream "Freddie you bitch" as Freddie runs pass him was top entertainment.
You need to get all the golden plushies to get the true ending!!
babe wake up Markiplier posted fnaf Security Breach part 7
Only a 30 min upload???
There is another ending with Vanny. It has to do with the princess quest arcade games.
SLAYYYYYYY
This game seems... kinda bad? Like, don't get me wrong, there's some neat and spooky stuff in there, but so many bugs and frustrating mechanics.
Mark: *taking a selfie* out here living my best life   Us:  Freddy is dying  Mark: this ain’t about him
28 minutes early
Hell yeah! I'd just finished the previous video when this was uploaded
Yea what’s up with that comic book style ending? I didn’t really want to agree with his “run outta budget” statement but it does seem out of place even though the art is cool
There are actually 6 endings in SB, and the true and canon ending is that you have to disassemble chica, roxy, and monty, upgrade Freddy, use the old elevator to go down into the Old Pizzeria.
I’m excited to see the next part!
The end had me dying 🤣
I hope he figures out that after he gets the claw upgrades, he can go back to roxy raceway and find that area he found before that lead to no where
When did freddy become a good guy?
Welp, no jumpscare list yet, guess it's my turn. They're probably a second or two off but it beats not having one. There aren't many so good luck.  3:33 some broke ass moon thing 7:28 that moon thing screams real loud 8:51 ok I know it's not a jumpscare but I jumped and was scared so good enough 10:45 PLAN A 12:23 horse have been held. Thanks moon man 23:08 hi 23:18 hi 27:53 damn security bot 28:26 here's another security bot 29:13 Monty wants to say hi  Congrats, you survived. Honestly not too bad this time.
There is actually a really funny exploit I learned from 8-BitRyan, who by extension learned not from Razzbowski. If you go back to Roxy’s raceway there is another head from the driver assist bot. Picking up this head will allow you to save again as the game thinks it’s 5:15 again and will tell you to get the head repaired
I'm dying the way mark was screaming Freddy at 28:44
Moon: ITS PAST UR BEDTIME Me: Yeah bitch I know because I might not have a dad tomorrow
I couldn't breathe when Freddy ran bye and Mark started screaming for all he was worth. Top ten anime betrayals
I love how in every episode mark narrates that he was stupid and died several more times before succeeding 💀
I live day to day for these videos, lmao. I got so hooked on watching you play this game.
Game: *Gives clear instructions on what to do*  Mark: *Doesn't pay attention and gets frustrated why nothing is working*
:)
I swear everyone in this comment section is so corny
Mark : This is not the real ending.   The rest of the FNAF franchise: “ Is 2D and mostly pixelated”
This 7s the earliest ive ever been to a Markplier video
Holy fuck when freddy ran clear past both mark and monty I couldn't breath, i was laughing so hard
Hey why dont you play minecrsft it has a BIGGGGGG uptade about CLIFS and CAVES
Theirs more endings!!! That I know of could you do the other endings???
Me: almost crying at the ending Mark: 18:00
And Freddy leaves Mark at the mercy of Monty fitting.
28 minutes early
Jumpscare list:  3:33 7:29 10:45 12:23 27:53 29:14
OMG I’M EARLY
FRADDAYYYYYYY YOUUU BIIITCHHHH
11:45 my phone just crashed cause of how many time Mark Saïd: are you sirious  because of siri
I'm guessing they had the sequence with Vanny be in comic form because having audio of a (presumably human) being ripped limb from limb was too disturbing for a game that's often played by 12 year olds
“Vanny is a red HAREring!”        -Markiplier 2021
lol the newspaper at 19:47 "blah blah blah blah blah this article has nothing to do with anything relative to the game blah blah blah blah yackity smackity blah blah blah"
Bruh mark's brain straight up shut down in this video
By any chance have you guys heard of bone broth? Really good stuff
"Did they run out of budget..?" that killed me lmao-
I hope someone animates that last freddy sequence, because that was funny as hell.
There are 7 endings I think
I feel like they focused to much on the map and gameplay, but not much on the story, it seems pointless and kind of lazy. In truth, all you really do is spend the night in the pizza plex and destroy animatronics that seemingly appear to be trying to help you. It's kind of disappointing not going to lie. Also, why is this game called "Five Nights at Freddy's" if it's literally just one night WITH freddy? misleading much?
There are 6 endings. You don't need to get all of them. Just the main ones
💋
oh dear im late 🥲
This game has so many endings
was literally sitting on marks channel and reloading every few hours lmao is this a problem
mark: how did i miss all this stuff? also mark: *runs through the whole game*
Mark you have to keep playing for all the endings!!!
This series has had a lot of pauses where mark just says “watch as I spiral into insanity”
MARKIPLIER IS GREAT!! MY CONTENT IS WAY WORSE!!
The ending was funny
no jumpscare will ever be scarier than the scene where they disassembled freddy, like holy shit i watched with my mouth open in shock like omg they really did that??
First
8 secs and it's already the best editing
I was literally counting on you to post before I woke up, thank youuuuuu
Don't know if this will help, but a lot of people have said to complete the princess quest games and that's how you get the ultimate true ending.
10/10 Very Buggy -IGN
Hey mark there is a way to save your game after 6am. Go to Roxes Race way and pick out the head (it re-spz) and you with go back to 515am and be able to save (it will not affect the rest of the game)
No not Freddy he was like a father to me!
Wow, that ending was RUSHED.  This game screams "we had a cool idea for an environment and built a game around it". There is no real.. core gameplay idea that's built upon or anything.
Thank you mark we love you and you’re videos I look forward to them
AAAA 22:55 or something right when it said low power, MY PHONE SAID IT AT THE EXACT SAMe TIME
Please tell me he gonna finish the game
Petition for Oldest First to be an organize in comments
Mark: what are you doing here so early me: realizes I haven’t watched p6
Been waiting 4 hours for this
I enjoy this series so much
Ahh yes, another upload thank u for blessing us all on this day Mark
today is my birthday!
Mark you are right the game isn’t fully utilized but I think it’s a good thing to point out that this was delayed multiple times to create these areas and this is Scott’s last FNAF game. There is a ton of lore though, and you can save if you stay. You should also check out glam rock salon. Hope this is useful.
The stages of grief
Still much to see Mark! Afterall, a sleeping molten friend is lurking with remains.
yay
almost a quarter of a million views before 30 minutes insane
Not first
hi
Is he gonna make a part 8 trying to find an ending???
"go away I havent even done the intro yet"😂
ayyoo just got done with part 6
Game: *super sentimental moment* Mark: 😂😂😂
update, Freddy died and I'm crying
There are like 4 diff endings and not counting the secret ending
Y’all are commenting before the video even ends!?!?
i love this series
YOU KILLED FREDDY 🙄🙄
....what is happening
the princess game is what you need to find.
28:44 don't ask just watch 😂😂😭🤣
Mark! See if you can find the canon ending with Springtrap!
Cheese
Mark: Gets the second worst ending  Yeah, you nowhere near the right ending, mate
I think that Mark would LOVE a mod where Freddy is replaced with Chica
These videos keep getting better and better by each upload. This is entirely unrelated but Mark , you have got me and a lot of other people through a lot and just know we all love you sm. Keep up the good work , keep hydrated and safe as well :]
Helikopter helikopter
18:17 Chewbaca is that you?
I literally checked YouTube every hour or two just to see if this video was out yet, a seriously good series.
Secret ending at the sinkhole
26 minutes ago?? :0
FREDDDAAAAAAY
Mark when Freddy was being disassembled it sounded like a human screaming in pain. The scream sounded like a little boy. I don't know if anyone else heard it?
Mark has now reclaimed his throne as the king of FNaF
They should’ve gave us what was in the trailer. Delay the game by a few months
I seriously love the fnaf series but this video has me like "Wtf devs?" Why did we kill Vanny exactly? We saw her like twice the entire game but she's the main villain? Where did these disappearances come from they were never mentioned in the playthrough, for all we knew we were a kid sneaking around but suddenly we were there for disappearances? The game left me scratching my head, honestly. Our goal was to survive and get out right? So an ending is kill someone who said 3 sentences to us, Freddy gets shit on, credits. HUH? The setting is amazing but the story telling is uh..confusing.
that was perfect🤣🤣
Im seeing vanny in the thumbnail and i already know this is gonna be exciting
AHHHHH
Mark:why do I keep dieing? Me: maybe if you went to the charging station like Freddy told you too
im finally early to his vid 😎
NOT FREDDY😭😭😭
That fact I feel like 6,192 comments means im early. EARLY :)
Does mark know a herring is a fish
Hello everyone who found this comment! Here's a break from all the bots! (I hope a bot doesn't comment here first)
I would love to see it
30 minute gang were you at??
Monty: There you are  Mark screaming*: FREEDDY  Mark: OMG FREEDDY YOU BASTARD
Everytime you press Q it sends Freddy a signal to go to WHERE YOU PRESSED Q not where YOU are so you basically sent like 40 different places for Freddy to go lmao
I loved watching mark play fnaf the same way as I did as a child, literally hope they make even more fnaf games now just so I can re-experience this once again
There is multiple different endings
he has to do the secret ending brooooo
The vanny path was missing a walk over and some build up, teleporting you when the game kept it in-control at every turn.
There’s a bad, good, true, secret & many more endings
Beat all the princess quest games in order
Been waiting for this video to come online for about 7 hours now, while watching other youtube videos and doing nothing productive. Nice
I feel like Fazbear Entertainment and the SCP Foundation have the same Ethics Comittee
Can't wait for him to get the other endings . . . . Oh he's gonna suffer
The fact that at 7:31 mark.exe had just stopped working
I’m very sure in that Outro Mark is not going to stick to his word So ignore those links in that description
Lets go
I THINK IF YOU GO TO MONTY GOLF INSTEAD OF FAZERBLAST YOU GET MONTYS CLAWS
Markiplier: *sad at Freddy dying*  Also markiplker at the end of the video: *FREDDY YOU BASTARD*
Feels like some of the endings are unfinished and were supposed to be animated, lol...
I am proud to say that I cried when Freddy told Gregory he was his superstar.
If anyone can explain the vanny  situation to me I’d be grateful
Hehehe I’ve been expecting you
Yay I'm finally earlyy! Even Mark knows
this game is kinda meh but it's good cause markiplier is playng :)
GOD I FUCKING LOVE THIS SERIES
I feel like with every episode markiplier makes of this game, he is slowly loosing his sanity
Just to trigger Markimoo, I will not Listen to Distractable and I will not get cloak merch! I don't have enough money after all.
The elevator music in this game is amazing.
Happy christmas/holiday's eve!
I was tearing up because the “you are my super star..” and then I got a Samsung ad😂
honestly mark thank you for posting everyday after this came out, the little middle schooler that remembers watching the first ep of the fnaf series is jumping up and down. cant express how much gratitude i have for your content
Bing chilling
Pog
Fun fact there are at least 6 confirmed ending, so there is a lot more for you to do Mark to unlock all of them
Him adjusting freddy
Yess, the theories, they lores the connect.
why so late :, (
HEHEHHEHEH IVE BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY
I was here within 30 minutes of it bieng uploaded
7:28 ig those doors are scary
Mark please I’ve seen so many spoilers!
Freddy Fazbear: slowly Dies.   Markiplier: *does a Wtf laugh💀*
i love how we're all just here watching some guy scream at robotic rabbits and a weird moon guy
I'm starting to think markiplier isn't enjoying this game and I feel bad if he wants to get all of the endings for his fans , I tend not to judge games too harshly but this one isn't the best , it's very glitcy and buggy with a few design flaws
these videos are the highlight of my day
Freddy did say that something was going on other than Vanny tho
Excuse me? I wasn't expecting to cry over FNAF today wtf
This game has a lot of endings but there is one ending you HAVE to see.  To get it you have to stay at the pizzeria and then go to Monty golf to get Montys claws to fully upgrade Freddy and then go to an old elevator.  I don’t really know the specifics of how to get it, (I think it’s called the True Ending?) Id recommend looking at a spoiler free guide but trust me, you really have to see this ending.
at 19:39 I can't believe that mark actually discovered the true ending before even realizing it...he figured out that stay was the true ending and that getting the last upgrade from monty and all that was the real end to the game. I find that amazing.
I think their going to put DLC in this game because I wish there were more content and story
Hi
This series getting me through my Christmas trauma.
man that comedian Staffbot was WILD, never heard such amazing jokes before!
Mark: freddy I need help Freddy: brb
Mark not getting the true ending
19:36 what is the correlation of a fnaf video game and a ALIVE hockey player?
In previous video: Charging stations are offline  Mark: *WHAT I AM GONNA DO NOW IS TO GO TO THE CHARGING STATION TO GET AWAY FROM THE MOON MAN*
Woooooooooo
Tbh this game is very underwhelming
I love how Mark is so confident with his theories and ends up being wrong and his reaction is hilarious.
FNAF would not be the same without Mark, and when the day comes where there will be no more FNAF games, will be a fking sad day
I just finished watching the last part and now I’m here!
There’s more then one ending.
i love how the link has "bruh" in it
THE ONE ON ONLY BEST GAME OF: Five Nights at Freddy !
I have been waiting mark
He got all the best glitches you can possibly get
This game is a hot mess. It has its moments, but it’s a hot mess.
Im glad I’m not the only one that was upset about the comic book endings. For a game series that uses a lack of quality to its advantage, this really chugged nuts to experience. Even Fnaf Pizza Sim had a kick ass ending with just the voice performance of Cassette Man.
yesssss
Freddys death made me tear up a bit
Never been this early
Never would have thought a fnaf game could make me cry
WAIT POSTED 25 MINUTES AGO HOLY SHIT IM EARLYYY
Im ealry for once hahaha. Also you should make a video with all the 3 endings and the secret ending if you play every princess quest arcade game
What the hell is this game man
NOOOOOO Markiplier 😭😭😭😭 u chose the bad ending. There r multiple endings and I believe there r 2 good endings.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
There's  are more endings
Im waiting for this 🔥🔥🔥
Good lord they did not finish this...There was clearly alot of effort that was put into this game but holy crap it feels so rushed and undercooked. Also the story is just...non existent?
LMFAO 28:45
Let's go
you’re telling me they had that many people working on the game and it still had that many bugs ??
WHAT HAPPENED the song 7:34
LETS GOOO
Moon man didnt get you It was 6 am
Mark, there’s six different endings. They can be kinda weird to get since some of them you can only get by doing very specific things. Also, in the fazbear theatre, there’s a certain secret that can be enabled using the fazcam, the item you get after disassembling Monty. It has something to do with cardboard cutouts and a poster in the Fazbear theatre. One more thing, there’s a glitch that gives you the ability to save past 6 am. I don’t know how you go about it, but I’m sure there’s a tutorial somewhere on how to.
Wtf was that ending LMAO, I understand nothing.
i got scared when he says ur early lmaooo
did anyone notice the circus baby plush at 22:34 ?
Good news 🗞! I am 🕺🏼 almost a cock 🐔❤️‍🔥
Freddy trying to find mark is me trying to find my mom when she leaves me at the checkout 🥲
I like how Mark closed the pop-up telling him that the recharge stations will not work and then screams why don't they work the irony in it is hilarious
Game: it's the end, you can't save or use charging stations! Mark: can't remember. 'why can't I charge!'
Cool video
There are 4 or 5 different endings
30 MINUTES AGO LETS GOOOO
waiting for this all day oh my lord
Mark: FREDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY  Freddy: *Ignores Mark and runs up the stairs*   Me: *Dies of laughter*
FINALLY THE NEW VIDEO
They couldn't show vanny being realistically mauled to death by an army of killer S.T.A.F.F.
THE ENDING COUGHHHHHHH
Does anyone know which ending he got first? Was it the bad ending?
I feel like they made that end cutscene a comic strip because they didnt wanna show an animation of a human being ripped apart
I honestly feel like this game wasn’t ready to be put out but steel wool put it out anyways just to please everyone who’s been waiting for 2 and a half years. I’m very disappointed in it
I love this series!!!
Yes yes yes yes
Fish.
markipiler:*screaming at freddy* freddy:*has no idea where markipiler is*
once again- waited all day for this video. love this series more than i thought i would
Mark where you call Freddy is where he goes to if you keep moving he won't follow you you have to call him and dont leave that spot
EARLYY
UPLOAD FASTER YA KHARA!!!!!
Congrats Mark you had to most plain face over watching Freddy being Dissemble
WAIT WHAT DID THE GAME ACTUALLY END?!?!?? Whaaaat lol. I mean I know that FNAF games aren't thaaaat long but they definitely have tons of secrets in them to find
whoop whoop im earlyyyy
Finally
This game is absolutely unfinished on a huge scale. The trailers suggest a completely different story than what we have here, and I think it would've been so much better if they simply delayed the game again instead of releasing a cobbled buggy mess like this
I was really refreshing marks page until I saw another video of the series
play all the princess quest arcades for the true ending the 3rd one is in vanny's room
turns off the phone* notification* picked up the phone immediately*  Me: well, this is what i been waiting for
Get Monty's piece and go down the elevator in Roxy raceway with all 3 pieces on Freddy to get the true ending Mark
Hasnt even gotten the secret ending...
A friendly reminder to ignore the devilish users competing in the reply sections of top comments.
LETS GOOOOOOOO
Deadass waited for this video all day 💀
9:25 it's not just me right.
I really hope he sees the loading dock escape ending. That's the best one
28:47😂😂😂😂
Npice
Early for once
Im not watching any fnaf security breach videos if Mark's not done. This is tradition
*Freddy really said you can deal with Montgomery on your own 💀*
GUYS MARKIPLIER JUST POSTED
me trying to find something to do while whaiting for sun and moon mask to dry mark: *posts vid* me FRIK YEAA
Mark : Bye Freddy Freddy : *PURE SLINCE*
Does Gregory not get hungry? Tired even?? It’s not implied that he eats/drinks anything throughout this whole game. Not sleeping is more understandable but not drinking or eating?
I'm early for once
I can’t wait for him to react to the true ending.
OMG IM SO EARLY HIIII
This game is really bad.... but at the same time, it had so many good ideas...
dose anyone have an idea why youtube wont show the description of videos for my pc
Why am I early
This was posted 24 min ago wow
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
was interested how far he could go without a save and ngl its kind of far, still he did not get to the true ending, kind of makes me upset oh well another time :) thank you mark for uploading for us, you should take a little bit of rest tho. <3
I’m still petitioning that somebody PLEASE make a animation between Mark and Freddy!! It would be so HILARIOUS!!!! 🤣
i love mark's metacommentary throughout these videos highlighting his goofs.. so funny.
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
After seeing mark playing this game  I realized this game sucks with full of bugs avoid at all cost. This is an unfinished game. The arts drawing at the end says it all.
There is a secret ending can you please play for it at the end of the game
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
i’m finally *slightly* early >:)
“You are my superstar…”  Why must they make the end of 2021 SO PAINFUL

I literally finished watching the 6th part hpurs ago and now i have this at the same day! Thx mark

I’ve been waiting all day for this, I’m halfway done and I hate everything 🥲🥲   28:00 Mark just screaming for Freddy sent me over, the fact that when he finally gets Freddy to come to him, he just runs right past Gregory 😂😂😂 I’m dead
He needs to find the three princess quest arcade machines for the good ending
theres a good ending, a bad ending, a true ending, a destruction ending, a hero ending, and an unmasked ending. the first ending you got was the destruction ending where pretty much everyone dies with no answers found. if you were to click leave at the door, you would get the bad ending.

YESSS A NEW POST WHAT MAKES MY DAY BETTER
what a beautiful intro
Mark: *spams freddy call button* Freddy: *tries to reach the last spot he called as mark also proceeds to run away from him*

Markiplier you need to collect all of the golden plushies and then you unlock the secret ending
For some reason  When I was younger, mark screaming and shit was hillarious Now as I'm older it just majorly pisses me off and I have no idea why. Guess my tolerance for people being loud, screaming, making weird sounds and shit is just 0.

Love it how this all happend in the space of a single night
"Did they run out of budget for the last animation?" 😂😭
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
red herring😭😭😭
We are EEEARLY
If the game was over five nights I think more could have been done. Gregory noticing all the strange things on the first night then coming back every night for the rest of the week, may have helped the story to flow a little better. Game looks great but the story feels rushed.
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
This game feels like it was written by Wattpad
ok
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
Mark was so sad when freddy died that he couldn't even speak.
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
After years of being terrified of Freddy...if anything happens to that damn bear I'll lose it. Edit: God damn it!!!!

EWW I hate that ending Mark got. Why would you make the last part a shitty cartoon?

Hi mark
Excited that i got here just in time for this video's release :) I've been really looking forward to it
Theres a theory that vanessa isn’t vanny and I think the ending isn’t animated is bc vanny is a human in a costume so it might of been too “brutal” I’m not sure but Yh vanny is probs controlled by Alton ( springtrap)

NOOOOOOOOO FREDDY
Well we have a new rage compilation coming up: Markiplier Rage Compilation Fnaf Security Breach - FREDDY!!!!!
Yo mark, you’re getting a lot of bots in your comments. Maybe check it out if you’ve been unaware?
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
he actually sounded like freddy when he did the impression haha
Can you pls take Freddy to Bonnie bowl
Mark pls make more I've been spoiled and I want to finish this game with u
Mark, Just tell Gregory to accept his fate
Oof
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
“You are my… superstar..”  THE MOST PAINFUL WAY TO END 2021
Theres no way he gets the best ending first time so I hope he goes back and does some of the others as much as he hasn't really shown an interest in the story this time I feel like he would have appreciated what it contains back in the day. I do not enjoy the watching mark get mad parts. Yep I knew insta pressed button ends game. Yeah he's never getting the 3 star ending. Not that he'll ever read this but Mark in her office use the arcade machine not the button for the best ending. The normal (not really true) ending is different but the best ending is arcade machine in vanny office. Screaming for freddy knowing it's not smooth sat the best of times instead of getting in one of the hiding spots and them getting mad. Seems like he's trying to relive his fond fnaf memories but just doesn't care for it any more
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
Mark there are more endings
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
I wish Mark put this much effort into actual good games.
Where im the only one screaming at mark to just get in to Freddys recharge station with freddy
You are correct this isn’t the true ending- you should totally explore in the game more to get all endings! Regardless I really enjoyed watching you play this game!
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
yay! almost a cock!
18:08 Me when I watched the last episode of Evangelion
Mark: *trying to survive* Moon: “and I took that personally”🖤🖤🖤
I like how mark is calling Freddy  for help but Freddy just ignores and ran passed Him 😂😂😂
These videos come up so conveniently when I have to eat dinner kekekeke
All i can say that you have soo many option¯\_(ツ)_/¯
yes sirrrrrr
Mark: "what u doing here, ur early"  Me: OFC I AM, IVE BEEN WAITING ✋ 🤣
There’s the secret spring trap ending
Mark, you have that Chica upgrade that stops animatronics if you go for the other endings try to remember that 😆
MaRk: FREDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDY FreEdy: I don’t get pay enough for this!😒
*sees Freddy and the robots have a face-off* me: oh cool, a fight! *sees him get disassembled* me: *blonde guy blinking gif*
I thought you weren't gonna upload today
Wow how could u do that to Freddie
Oof... he ended it early.😬
Vanny acting sus 👁
Run Freddy run
Well, multiple endings aren’t a foreign thing in FNAF games.
I'm the only one to not want mark be in in pain (upset)
[Minor Spoiler in this comment]    Thank you, Mark. Thank you so much. "Did they run out of budget for the last animation?" This is legit how I feel about almost every ending in this game. Vanny and Vanessa being barely present (and yes, they are 2 different person, 1 ending proofes that without doubt). They 100% somehow ran out of budget. It honestly is a disappointment.  Edit: Him laughing at the sight of Freddy "shutting down" in the first ending just shows everything wrong with these endings. They want you to take it seriously. But it doesn't work. It's just so cheap and honestly: the comic panels don't even look good.  Edit 2: Your opinion about the game being originally totally different is (in my opinion) 100% true. There are a lot of polished moments. But the paths connecting these few moments feel really rushed. And honestly, the endings are just insultingly bad.
Omg I was waiting for this And didn’t even realize it was out until now so I’m late....;0;
Mark, please continue with inscription, I was loving that series
Mark. All I will say is that there are more endings. They involve the princess arcade games.  Have fun hunting!!!
Him screaming for Freddy gets me everytime
Why did they make Vanny hot.
Haven’t watched the video in full yet but Mark if you wanna be able to save again you can go to Roxy’s raceway and pick up the broken head again, this will put you back to 5:15 AM again and you will be able to save your progress and do the Monty boss to get his claws and get to the real final boss under roxy raceway, I don’t know if they patched it yet but it’s worth a try.  Normally you’re supposed to do all that without dying but that’s kinda tough
Woa
Who is here before 6k comments
Please go back and play the princes quest games
Pog
Im scared but i like it, which emote should i use? " :) " ? or " :( " ?
Him screaming FREDDY has to be the highlight
Actually Mark, you do go to that theatre in the story when you choose to go after Monty.
Jump scare list: Moon: 3:29 Moon: 7:28 Moon: 10:44 Moon: 12:23 Security Bot: 27:53 Security Bot: 28:27 Monty: 29:14
My name is Danessa so when he was screaming Vanessa I got worried that I was in trouble so 😀
AAAAH IM SO LUCKY I JUST FINISHED EPISODE 6
I’m so glad you posted it
14:10 Mark: "Vanny?" Reason: You found Vanny's hideout above Fazer Blaster a few in-game hours ago, don't you not remember?
There 6 to 7 ending-
is this the end? why are we still here, only to suffer
A really sad moment where Freddy dies: Everyone: in dispare Mark: WHEEZE
This is like 12 days of Christmas but fnaf security breach
Mark: Click on them or I will come find you........I will come find you  Me: *Doesn't click on the links so Mark can come find me*
I love how mark just slowly guesses the lore throughout episodes 😭
Plot twist “that kid could stay in freedys place until 6 am”
I really wanna see what the leave will give u
that was a Freddy snuff movie.....
Come to the main stage for a reward~
Whoever edited the intro DEFINITELY had a lot of fun
SAVE PAST 6AM: Re grab the staff bot head at Roxy raceway. It fixes the option, so you don't have to lose progress
This game is the most horrible fnaf game ever released, you can see that scott left the franchise. I'm only watching because mark is a great youtuber and he can make it kinda fun to watch. I'am going to rewatch sister location, to remind myself what a FNAF game SHOULD be. (The entire game should be more like the section where moondrop drags away freddy until the point where you repair him)
Freddy: "You are... my superstar" Me: *violent sobbing*
HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Markiplier is my favorite podcast how did you know?
Mark is getting a lot of spam bots on videos lately
ik we all waited for this next part  to come out, staring at our screens LOL
You technically got one of the harder endings first. I remember when you said, "what was the reason for discovering her lair?"....well if you don't, you don't have the vanny option at the end.
that vanny ending was the cheapest cop out I have ever seen. It really feels like they ran out of budget or time and just colored the storyboard instead of animating anything.
Game: "So you can't use the charging stations."  Mark: **Tries to use the charging stations**
YASS
Papa Freddy…
i also can’t wait till mark realizes he needs to play all of the princess games
Freddy: [dies] Mark: *[Confused wheezing]*
Random thought, what if Vanessa and Vanny are the same person?
Did you know there was a One night at Flumpty's 3 released not long ago?
Fun fact at the time I am posting this comment no one has finished this video
literally just finished the last episode
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
merry christ mis mark :)
mark: FREDDDYYYYYY FREDDYYYY freddy: i am suddenly deaf
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
Hey mark   I don't know if you're going to see this comments but there's multiple endings to this game, like seven
GOOD NEWS! IT IS ALMOST A COCK!
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
Lmfao Freddy completely ditching Mark in his time of need has me rolling
poor mark got the bad ending
He’s back baby, baby he’s back
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
Good news!
Mark, here’s a hint about the game: (not a spoiler)  Giving Freddy Roxy’s eyes activates the ending. If you want to get Monty’s upgrade, save the eye upgrade until you’re ready for the end. That way you can save while still looking around the map and getting the rest of the upgrades  explore the endings!!!
AGH
That was one of 6 endings
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
WHAT YOUTUBE DO AGAINST  BOTS  GODAMNIT
when its 6:00 to go roxies race track area and re-pick up the spare robo head to reset time to 5:15 so that you can save again and keep exploring the rest of the megaplex in peace (you cant do leave or venny ending once ya choose this tho on that save file)
Mark, when its time to leave, go to the red door on the side at roxy raceway. go down those stairs, and open the gates (chica and monty upgrades required), then go down the elevator to find the true ending. Thats all Im gonna say.
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
Am I wrong or did Mark never re-do the voice upgrade from the last save? I assumed no because the voice is old Freddie but nobody else seems to be addressing it, and Mark’s never mentioned it either.  Edit: oh my god the ending of Mark zooming around shrieking for Freddy 😭😭
Let’s go I’ve been waiting all day for this video
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
Mark you definitely need to see the Canon ending I really want to see your reaction since everyone else's is so mundane

Mark reacting to Freddie's death: *WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZE*
Quality content
17:50 ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME HSDGYUSIKJNBXHSIAK<MSNZBXGHSU
I Cried when freddy died
There is multiple endings
Let’s go Mark!
Was really early but just enjoyed watching the views go up by the thousand with every reload of my feed
MARK YOU STILL HAVE THE MYSTERY OF THE BASEMENT AND HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 3 PRINCESS QUESTS, you passed one in vannys office
Damn we early.
That ending was overwhelmingly awesome
God, this game is so super broken, but I love it anyways.
I can't be the only one that thinks this game is broken and unfinished right?
Never been this early!
The three genders, stay, leave and vanny
Like for çhéësē
its almost a co- i mean its almost a clock
So buggy
10:07 *insert bryan fury laugh here*
This man is the literal definition of top quality FNAF content
Instructions: recharge stations have been deactivated Mark: IMMA GO TO A RECHARGE STATION!!!
If you get all the upgrades then go to the Roxy race way u can see afton then a normal fnaf game
Hey Mark, there’s another ending if you choose the "Vanny" option. If you play all of the Princess Quest arcade Minigames, you will be able to play the final one inside of Vanny’s room.   The 1st one is at the Glamrock Salon (which is near the entrance of Roxy’s Raceway) inside of the only building of the area.  The 2nd one is at the Fazcade. It’s where the DJ Music Man was chasing you at the end of the corridor.  Complete the 2 minigames, then, comeback to the "Vanny" option and instead of pressing the button to disassemble Vanny, play the Princess Quest 3 arcade machine inside of the room. You’ll get the ending after completing it.  Also no worries, you can’t get killed while you play the minigames.
There's so many wtf moments in this game. But I'm loving your playthru! Thanks mark and editors!
I doubt mark will ever realize the princess quest games are what gets the good vanny ending
Markplier there is 2 more endings
AHH
Why do i got a feeling freddy is going to turn on you at the end
IM NOT ABOUT TO CRY OVER A FUCKING FNAF GAME
I’m not sure if mark realized this but vanny is a human so in the dissemble vanny the robots pulled her limbs off
whenever you die it will take you back to the choices
18:10 - More like ran out of budget before the game even hit development.  Must've been the guy donating too much to hate groups :3
Freddy fazbear security breach part 8 😊👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
That shit hurt
omg mark 17:56 LMAO
i’m trying so hard to like this game but i really. cant. there are just so many glitches and frustrating points, and the overall lore is completely lost within the gameplay.
thank you for posting videos for us mark! we know you do so much to please us and we thank you for that!
Well , there's 4 endings ... The good ending , the bad ending the alternate ending ( I think it's called that ... ) and the true ending ... Would like you to go ahead and complete all of em ...
Mark:Calls for freddy Freddy:Passes by him Mark: *F R E D D Y!!!*
Cant belive i stayed up to watch this
You are ny superstay ong
Yoooo I’m early toooo. First time for this
Imagine if Vanny and Vanessa  met
Shot over here REAL QUICK as Im preparing Xmas feast for tomorrow
Slowly seeing mark's sanity fade is why i love FNAF
Funny how we got attached to a character that's been killing us for years. I was so heartbroken when it happened ;-;
Mark is slowly descending into madness-
Uploaded this as I was finishing the last one. Best Christmas gift ever Marky ⛄🎄🎅🎁💝
im confused i think maybe
Yesss
28:33 Freddy just said SIKE
THANK YOU MARK 🙏🏾
hey he said my name
Late today aren’t we
There's several different endings, one of which needs you to play the Princess mini games
Bro what is up with this game
This video came just in time for breakfast! I can’t finally eat breakfast!
Everyone else reacting to canny bad ending: *in tears*  Mark: *confused laughing*
Me happy
“You are my superstar...” Markiplier: *Wheezing Noises*
28:44 FREDDYYY FREDDDYYYYYY😭😭😭😭
The game is so badly designed I swear to Lord. Also stop blaming mark for these faults please!
Welcome to the game 2
There's 6 endings
GOOD NEWS! IT IS ALMOST A COCK
I’m literally like Freddy when I get notification from Markiplier
Swag
15:19 waiiit- she kinda...... 🥴
Is it just me or does the suit of vanny look like William astons suit in fazbear diner?
Do we like have a explanation of why everyone got like really dirty in 7 hours(before the whole smashing to bits,rammed by a car,disassembled or whatever)
I wish the game was just a little less buggy so that the endings had a little more impact here.
YAAAAA
I’ve literally been scrolling down on marks newest uploads cause I’m so hyped for this new episode!
why did you not check the leave choice?
supppppp
Just finished part 6 when this came out that’s sick :)
early gang wya
More Episodes!!!
Yes
Go to the dockkkkkk I was no joke screaming
mark still has to figure out the mystery of the basment and complete the princess quest games
5️⃣🌚⛔️🆓
literally turned post notifs on for this
finally please make 8 already
FREDDY NO
Helllooo i am prepared for the finale yes who else is
wow this is frustrating to watch
Man, this game's got some problems...
im early
Marks voice just really adds to the atmosphere of these games
8:12 Markiplier turned into Travis Scott
Anyone else think mark should have STOPPED spamming the summon Freddy button? Just to give the AI time to catch up to the location, rather than get a new location almost every second?
Cant wait for the ending! Cant accept the fact that this is the last fnaf game (from scot) that mark will ever play
Its become part of my daily schedule waiting for a new part of this series😭
They didnt patch the charging station bug, the charging stations are just disabled because it's almost 6 am
15:19,28:42,29:14,13:49,17:25,16:03,9:10,14:37,15:18,24:34
"Did they run out of budget to finish the last animation?"   Seems like they ran out of money to release a complete game. Buggy as all hell and obviously unfinished. This release was a cash grab at best. Hopefully Scott will use that money to patch the game and fix the god awful quality of life bugs
omg yes part 7 i was wondering where it was 🤩 thanks king
freddy hates mark
🐔🐔🐔
What happened?
There's multiple endings
Hi, King of Five Nights at Freddy’s This series is waaay Awesome! Have a Very Merry And Blessed Christmas and a Wonderful Joyfilled New Year! I appreciate you, World’s Best Gamer! Cheers! ✨Ⓜ️✨😊💕
Freddy: *fucking dies* Me: *uncontrollable sobbing*
w H a T  h A p P e N d
Mark the six different endings
MARKKKK IVE WOKEN UP SO EARLY FOR THIS TO COME OUT NOWWW
The funny part was I was rewatching part 6 when I got this notification.
i hope Steel Wool are gonna update the game and make the AI and a few animations more... presentable a few level changes would be appreciated, too
yay i was waiting for this
When the lore is so confusing that you don't know if it's a glitch or intentional
I am very early for once :) is the comment section proud?
oh my god this is the earliest ive been in years
do the intro mark 😐🤚/srs
Yes, I am here early
I have not been so excited for new uploads in a long time omg
Mark: Are you serious?  Game: we were in fact, serious
The game just.. went by too quickly. I felt nothing other than, "wut". No emotional   endearment.
hello how you doin
Aside from the comic book look, I'd be fine with it if there was full voice acting for it like that one "superstar" line. It feels a bit hollow without it. But nothing fandubs couldn't fix, I suppose.
the videos are getting progressively shorter and shorter
Aw no Freddy :(
Same I’ve was waiting for this all day
I’ll be honest I don’t like the comic book ending style they do. Why can’t they just have short cutscenes. Idk for some of the endings I think it’s ok but for others I’d rather have it animated. Idk.
Mark you should try and get the secret springtrap ending
Cant wait to see part 8
There are more endings play more
i was waiting all day. FINALLY HE UPLOADS
Fun fact: When commenting this, no one has watched this whole video!
here comes Markiplier saving my day
I just finished 6 when this came out😂 marathon
Goddamn, Rockstar Freddy,,,,
Watching this stuck in the bathroom almost vomiting lol
Wow, I'm here early.
Seeing freddy dying and the comic cutscene part gave me shivers so sad 😢
Neat
The game: "H-hey, 🥺👉👈 just so you know... charging stations won't w...work this time"  Mark: "WHY DONT STATION WORK"
15:18 ok why would they animate vanny like that. she simultaneously looks like a cat about to throw up and is somehow oversexualized. no one moves like that
i know I’m not the only one who’s been very invested in these videos, lovin it <3
mark must be the best and the worst fnaf player at the same time
Freddy: "You are my superstar" *dies* Mark: *WHEEZES*
The unison of the editing, gameplay and Mark is just perfect
50 gigabytes and they couldn't even make a fucking ending cutscene. Great Job!
I watched your fnaf 4 series in the time you took to make this video and I finished it as well.
FINALLYYYY
Freddy walking by Mark while he is being chased by Monty is by far the funniest moment of this series.
Omg
I just finished part 6, and a New episode just spawnned
I’ve spent all day watching fnaf theory’s waiting for mark to post 😭
Merry Christmas to you all guys ! Have a wonderful Eve. ❤️
Low key stalking ur account to watch this
I love how every time mark is giving tasks/directions he does the exact opposite
Hi
oh you actually made an  video today thank you mark!
Oh I’m kinda early wow
IVE BEEN WAITONG ALL DAY Y E SSSSSSSS
The game was incredible !! Thx for this let's play!!
watching Mark trying to deal with this broken ass game is hilarious
mark then: WaS ThAt tHe bItE Of ''87?!?! mark today: PFFFFWHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZE
Did you know when gregory told the bots to dissasemble canny they ripped her apart limb by limb and thats just wasting a perfect girls body if you tell me
Tem br
Oh boy, things are going to escalate this time, I know it.
" You are my superstar."
Why are these bots so bad lately.
freddy: *dies*  mark: *laughing and confusion*
AHHHH
HERE EARLY WOOOO
King mark has not found  "The ending yet" The one we Really want to see
I’m so happy whenever markiplier comes up on my recommended playing fnaf
"I know that you, for some reason enjoy my suffering" I feel called out
Hi markimoo
Freddy: _dying horribly_ Mark: *DID THEY RUN OUT OF BUDGET?*
Okay Mark so you probably already looked this up OR this comment will be dead and buried by the time you could read it, BUT!  By upgrading Freddy with Roxxy's Eyes, the game basically soft locks you into this "no save state". The only 2 endings that open up from that are the "Disassemble Vanny" and the "Leave" endings, which frankly both suck ass. The game never tells you this, for some reason, but the "True Ending" only needs Chica's voice box and Monty's Claws. I won't spoil anymore but that's basically it. By defeating Roxxy, you've soft locked your game into these two endings. If you wanted to get a different ending now, you'd have to do a bunch of missions without being able to save, including defeating Monty. The only thing I can recommend at this point is to somehow load a save file from before you give Freddy the upgrade and hope for the best.
i will never go away UwU
I made it here within 20 minutes because my notification was late but 20 minutes is still good 👍
GLAMROCK FREDDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This game is Heaven for video game YouTubers like Cory and Mark
That Vanny ending... it's.... great...
ENDING SPOILER            not the comic strip ending 💀
try and get the canon ending, mark ;)
Its 0:01 right now. Merry Christmas ☃️
sorry i'll leave
YESSS IVE BEEN WAITINH FOR THIS
Mark: “I don’t care if I have to do this again.” Also Mark: *definitely cares that he has to do this again*
Go to Monty golf and confront him then you'll get the upgrade pretty again and then you will have the ability to get a secret ending
i have been waiting
What was that ending?
marks confusion throughout literally this whole game makes it so much funnier
God, this Game's AMAZIN'
Message "Recharge stations don't work"  Mark "Why no recharge qnp"
Everyone: Cries bc Freddy dies Markiplier: *wheeze*
I like how it took me one episode  to realize this game is shit.  I hope there'll be some fan patches of some kind, or some post release big patch for christmas (or like, next year christmas).
Mark there's more than one ending If you choose stay you can leave at any time
Amazing Series! This series was the most fun i've had on youtube in a while!
I feel like there should’ve been better assistance for navigating this huge map.
Why does Vanessa sound like she’s trying to seduce Gregory? Forget the animatronics, Vanessa is the scary thing. Perv
This is why he's the king
Let's goooo
iv been waiting everyday for each 7 parts anyone else >>>
Sup
Roxanne : *cries* Caption : nobody will miss you  Me : Understandable, have a nice day
5:47
But mark what if I want you to find me?
There’s more
Do you know about the secret level located at moondrop's/sun's room? You can get there by getting the camera and then you need to flash 4 cutouts. After that, you need to find the poster with the old main 4 (in the theater) that'll turn into a door that leads to that room. There is a little tunnel you need to crawl through, you will see an arcade machine which you can play the secret level on.
18:02 Mark is so overwhelmed by sadness all he can do is wheeze in agony for Freddy
Pog vid
freddy fucking dies
Omg I’m so early
early ayyyy
i be on this man’s page just refreshing for hours
Nice into lol
Did you get Morty stuff to upgrade?
I'm early for once! I've been waiting for this episode all day
NO! Freddy... ;-;
woah this is the earliest ive been to a markiplier video
i finished the series at 6am, now i have more content an hour later
30 minutes of mark getting frustrated of not saving
Mark, we dont enjoy your suffering, we enjoy hearing you say stuff like “what?! What?! Why?!” “Oh my goooooood!” and “Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh”
Honestly, this game does a fantastic, incredible job at perfectly simulating what it is like to be a scared, confused little kid with way too much happening at any given time.
Wait was vanny freddy?
Earlyyyyyyyy o'clock XD
YES MARKIE POO
I just caught up RIGHT when Mark posted this episode. "Youre early, I havent even done the intro yet, go away" I felt like Mark was SPECIFICALLY calling me out lol
He always posts these vids about 1AM for me, and Ivalways wait, and watch it, even tho I have to be asleep. Fnaf can't wait. :)
There's a ending where you need to get montys upgrade
GOD I LOVE YOUR FNAF SERIES ❤️❤️😅
And i’ve been waiting all freaking day and it’s sad that Freddie dies
freddy saying you are my superstar... my heart is in pain
Did Mark not know that he can stun animatronics when he's in Freddy because he got it when he stole chica's Voice box.
Did they actually ran out of budget for the ending??" Hahahaha
Yayyyyyy finally our fav youtuber came back😆❤❤❤
Noice 😊
I'VE BEEN WAITING ALL DAYYYYY LET'S GOOO
13:50 CRYING SCREAMING SHITTING THROWING UP
That was confusing
It's not a Markiplier episode of Security Breach unless there's at least one moment of him pausing to talk about how stupid he is being
14:00 to skip to what Mark was actually supposed to do instead of wasting time wandering around and getting caught by Moon.
I don't know if you'll release one more video before Christmas, but either way; Merry Christmas!
Early
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH OMG
There is more endings you can do so much more
Freddy isn't broken he goes to the place he is called so say if I press q upstairs he is going to run not to me but to upstairs since that was where I called him.
there are more endings through this
Freddy:Nothing can hide from me now! Me:Uh is that a good thing or should I just get outa here?
I find it so funny whenever mark calls Freddy and Freddy just…runs off into another direction lmao
I’m crying the ending- it’s so sad  (Mark) WHEEZE
Oh god
Top 10 Anime betrayals
omg im here
The bots are getting a little out of hand lately huh?
Mark in order to unlock the good ending you will need to play all three princesses quests for the best ending
DO THE SPRINGTRAP ENDING
What happens when Gregory is in Freddy when the power dies
There's more endings
Me: check every hour to see if he uploaded it
Nice
NOOOO FREDDY-
marks gameplay is so much better than other youtubers
i swear this is /the/ worst fnaf game ever! theres no direction, no path, the saves are ridiculously hard and its bullshit, nobody should like this game
Freddy is not ready for the horrors of Vanny
AHHH IM EARLY FOR ONCE!
Thanks for the upload
:)))))
markimooooo
The Freddy eye noises at the beginning were like some unexpected ASMR.
I have been waiting all day for my markiplier serotonin boost!!!!😂😂
I love this series of security breach
i love this :,)
I won't lie, this game did NOT have the budget it needed.
OOOOOO I AM EARLY
man this game sucks lmao
We be clicking this shit so mfing fast i swearrr
i appreciate the consistent uploading
Actually there are two things I don't enjoy: You suffering so much and that creepy demonic voice changer. Can you get that out of there please?
this game is 40 dollars games are now becoming 80 dollars, maybe they are going to surprise release part 2
I've been waiting for this
HELL YEAH! I've been waiting all day!
I have been waiting all day for this 😁
16 minutes out. 162k views. The people are hungry for the King of Five Nights.
Mark struggling just to find the main entrance is on point
Anti-Markatron bots have no taste in quality.
so slight spoiler:     vanessa isn't Vanny
That intro messed with me, didn't know if the player was messed up or not
Hi Markimoo how are you and the egos doing?
When do you think he’s going to find out that he can move the cameras
Freddy is too much of a savage
You…you better do all possible endings….or else….or else I might have to bring out the….l
How does mark seem to get the bad ending always
18:08 IM CACKLING
are we just not going to talk about the beginning of the video?
This brings me happiness
The fact that he gets hundreds of thousands of views within less time of the videos runtime makes me feel like I'm watching it with a bunch of people ^^
Mark hears footsteps: *nervous listening* Freddy…?.. that better be you buddy  I’m waiting for it to not be freddy
that intro was hilarious lmao
Mark, and others in the comments, missed the game stating recharge stations will no longer offer protection. The entire time he was just supposed to get to the front entrance. It was, truly, that simple.
I love when mark plays fnaf, he just manages to make the games so much more entertaining.
Look how they massacred my boy 😭
I love how Freddy just runs around like a big idiot
🦍💨
Something about the late game makes me feel like it should have been in the development oven for longer...
What exactly is the surprise at the stage?
“These eyes are amazing! Nothing can hide from me now!” _those_ animations: 🙂
Mark just constantly arguing with himself is very entertaining to watch.
The way he says venessssa 😂😂😂
Markidaddy?
Everything is on hold until the freddy is ready
The Freddy goodbye made me sweat through my eyes profusely.
IVE NEVER CLICKED SO FASTTTTTT
Bro this came out 16 minutes ago and already has 27k likes godamn
Freddy really is like a dumb lil doggo, his heart is in the right place tho lol

Not once has he used chicas voice box. He has died when he could’ve lived if he used it
15:02
I absolutely died at the "So you sprint a bit but you aren't that long, so..." Only for the game to bug out and have you get jumpscared by him immediately
No mark I’m not serious this is all a joke
bruh i legit just finished part 6
mark trying to use the recharge stations when at the end of the last episode it said they were offline
i was the 67th viewer until my computer crashed
So glad to see, tonight will be fine now :)

Im just waiting all the for a new episode. so worth it tho
This man Freddy has been so mannerly. Like everytime a pen falls or the wind blows too hard he apologizes to Greg as if he accidentally ran over his parents😂
Just finished episode 5 and 6 because i was busy those days
Try to get Afton Ending its epic
YES i’ve been refreshing for hours
I love him so fucking much I swear <(￣︶￣)>
EARLY HAHEHHHHAHER >:DDDD
Mark: Freddy come here! Freddy : proceeds to stomp around in heaven
HEYY EARLY AGAIN
man Mark's videos always cheer me up on a bad day
WHAT TOOK U SO LONG
go to DanTDM, I think he's got other endings to this game
this is not the end!!
If this place like is in the game would exist I wish I could visit it in real life. Something like a House of Freddy and Friends or FNAF Wonderland 😁or idk. This game is so fantastic! I'm enjoying every single episode of Mark's let's play.
yas
You can find the secret ending by playing the video game on Vanny room I think
the way i jumped in excitement when i saw the notification
ow. my emotions.
I just finished binge watching part 1-6 and magically part 7 comes out
Freddie can now see thing other people can't. He can finnaly see all the bullshit.
perfect timing, i was about to go to bed, but alas!
I remember watching the first episode of the first FNAF game he ever played and now looking where he is now, wow. I just all the things he's doing I'm just so proud in a weird way. I hope everyone has a good day
This game is so broken omg XD
Can't believe I just wait for the FNAF upload everyday lol. I mean just WAIT. I don't have anything better to do so yeah lmao
I hate these people who are saying Mark is trash and his niece is in hell I can’t tell if they’re bots or not
Am i the only one checking my phone for the notification this video every 5 min
The excited scream I let out
I love seeing markiplier scream on freddy
first
Mark is so funny and just amazing I appreciate your videos mark😊
This game is so boring and terrible... What happened?
FREDDY NO
I like this series a lot, but I really miss inscryption
155,251 views in 16mins
Hey Mark, if you want to save after the choice, go to Roxy raceway and pick up the robot's head again! It'll set the time back to 5 :30 and let you save again without erasing any previous progress!
freddy jumping off and not surviving .. my heart hurts and i never thought id say that about freddy
mark trying to get into the recharge station after he was told they were shut down:  "are you serious? are you serious? are you serious? are you SERIOUS?"
maek there are multiple endings, one i think you should see
Cool series
I was so mad when Vanny tried to kill Freddy and was overjoyed when he said he still had a signal
Y'all can't be commenting before watching the whole thing... Literally oldest comment is 10 minutes. It says the video was uploaded 6 minutes ago. But the video is like 30 minutes...
Wooo 155,572....nd
I had such a bad day and this video made my day
there’s always a rush of sudden excitement every time I wake up knowing that there will be another episode from you! your videos are super fun 2 watch, thanks mark
Will you be doing the other ending
Okay so I’ve only watched mark so idk if this is right or not. But if you go to minigolf and then instead of the eyes you get the claws, pick Vanny, and then Freddy is able to defend himself. Would that be a different ending?
I love mark
This video is 30 minutes long.  This comment was posted 10 minutes after the video was posted.   This video has 5 thousand comments on it already.            do y'all even watch the videos?
yay
im so early holy crap
Watching mark play fnafsb is becoming hella therapeutic. I find myself looking for these daily uploads as they send me on a trip to about 5 to 6 years back. I think maybe sister location..
wow, mark became soulless, he doesn't feel emotions anymore !  freddy dies and just watches. (Mark, you are still cool, plz don't come find me)
That main stage thing Vanny was talking about appears to be cut content. As far as we can tell she might talking about the elevator to the Canon ending in Roxie Raceway, but that’s just a theory…
i like turtles
Freddy: *dies*  Mark: *HYSTERICAL LAUGHING*
Signing in on my less than one hour card
I just finished episode 6 when this was posted
Mark in the last one: "this cant be the end" Mark now: "why couldn't it have been the end"
EEEEEEE I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!
16 MINUTES AGO!
Have a great Christmas Mark!
I have never been this early for eps!
I have been praying for this video 🙏
The king ThE KInG
im pretty sure mark mested up when chaged freddy and it made it to 4 am on the secount video or the third or the first
I've literally been waiting for today's part for a long time 😭
PRINCESS QUEST IS THE WAY FOR THE TRUE ENDING MARK
Oompa Loompa
Im finally early!!!! Watching Markiplier after just waking up became my hobby lmao.
THANK THE LORD ITS FINALLY TIME!!!
MARK!! I WAS WORRIED YOU WERE GONNA HOLD OFF AN EPISODE LIKEBA WEEK OR SOMETHING FOR ANTICIPATION?!?     THANK COD I WAS WRONG!!!LOLOLOL
WTH ITS ONLY HAFE ANB AHROUR I WANT MY 2 HOUR EPISODE I WAITED 25 HOURS FOR 30 MINUTEWS
I hope mark does all the endings
I thought you gonna get some break because me or perhaps we, waited for hours 🤣
WOOOOOOO YEAAA BABY!!! this is what I've been waiting for! this is what it's all about!! WOOOO!!
literally waited for this
I havent watched through the vid yet, but just in case you werent aware Mark, the game has a set length for the most part, what you do in that time varies based on how long things take you, and with 6 different endings you'd have to move quicker through certain bits to get to everything. I do hope you play at least for the princess quest ending, oh, and, there's an old elevator you should look for, for a secret'ish ending!   Edit: Also Mark, you dont need any of the upgrades actually, i guess besides maybe Monty's claws to get through some chains, but yeah, the upgrades are the real red herring, lol
I watch corykenshin security breach but this is cool too mark!
"so you sprint " he also teleport mark
Just to let u know there are 7 endings
Y’all are so fucking fast
Can you guys imagine what disassembling Vanny ACTUALLY did considering she is a human in a suit? Was she just ripped to shreds alive?
Just got done watching part 6 Mark: uploaded video 13 minutes ago  Me: I've never clicked on video so fast
13 minutes ago mark
Freddy casually jogging past  Gregory and Monty while Mark is screaming his name is so far my favorite moment from his playthrough.
let’s go!!! i was so excited today waiting for this ep!
Yeeees I've watched these episode after episode
IT WAS ALMOST WHAT
Wait so mark is done playing this game????
alright let's see how you suffered this time😂
Mark use motys claws to bust throught the doors in the basement then use chicas voice to open the other one then and only then will you find the true ending with an old friend
Came too early for a jumpscare list, we are going in blind
while this is fun, dont forget about inscryption!
I need more inscryption
“I only hope I’m going vaguely in the right direction which I think I am”  Moon: Sure about that?
Inspiring words from another video  “Among us a-among us, among us among us. Among us among us!”
Great video obviously but that intro was the real 10/10:D
Me: *sees mark posted 11 mins ago* Mark: “what’re you doing here? You’re EARLY” Me: how does he know?!
That intro tho
Early
Legit been refreshing my yt on Mark’s channel for an hour
Mark calls freddy then freddy runs past him and run upstairs  FREDDDDDYYYYYYY
You are *my* superstar..   WHAT. NO. TOO SAD.
Hi
here we gooo :D
Oh?
OMG IM EARLY
Wtf was that intro lmao
*Sniff* *sniff* smells like another vanish mark...
Gregory: Step 8 Freddy!!  Freddy: For you Gregory not for me!
That ending though 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
markiplier part 8 please. was it released like 15 mins ago? yes. I love this series fr
I don't like being this early, it's weird.
Last part: recharging stations are disabled   Mark this part: why charging station not working
Hi
I ALMOST THOUGHT THE EPISODE WASN'T GOING TO COME OUT TODAY
. | . . | .
As soon as I finished part 6, part 7 uploaded lol
Alternate title: Mark loosing his mind trying to get Freddy to listen to him for 45 minutes
I don't blame mark at all for being confused by all this. It's super unclear as to what you're supposed to do. Sure, the objective says escape the pizzaplex, but then a character entices you to go somewhere else. So what are supposed to do? Security breach is weird.
This game is unbelievably broken.
LATE
first 200k viewers whats up
Here before 1 million views- I know this might seem annoying but I’m not normally this early
you're late,
I love how Mark always tries to find the meaning of these games.
I was early yesterday and today!
I love this series it's so addicting!
there are multiple endingas
Yeeesss Was dying for this to post! Thank you Mark!
"why are you here so early"  im gay
I don’t think you’re able to go into the charging stations during the last hour and it literally tells you that you can’t use the charging stations and it’s so painful to watch mark try and use the charging stations for a bit in the beginning. Like mark please 😭😭
Oh this was early
I wait for this more than Christmas now smh
I appreciate you helping raise awareness for those with mental health issues, for the now 6 years I’ve been subscribed, your content and you in general have helped me through many tough times, thank you!
endings all suck ass but still fun to watch :)
it's illegal to be this early
This is just “Watch Mark struggle: the series™️” and I love it
"what are you doing here, you're too early, I haven't even done the intro yet" that was funny
[18:15] Mark: Become Animatronic
why did Vanessa say I have a prize for you like that....
BRUH MY FACE LIT UP WHEN I SAW THE NOTIFICATION
im just glad, as a community, we voted for longer episodes instead of 3 10 minute episode we get 1 ~hour long video
Where is part 4 and 5?
👍👍
MARK you literally SET OFF my VIRGO tendencies, WHY ARE YOU NOT STEALTHY OR DEALING WITH SHIT FOR YOURSELF SO YOU CAN SEEE UHGGGG
Let’s goooo
Freddy - “You are my superstar” *dies Mark - *manic laughter*
Thank god the next video came out, I am really early!  I love his fnaf videos, I love in a few ones ago darkapiler came out. MORE DARKAPILER!
This game is broken as hell
Been waiting for this finally 🥳🥳🥳
I love milk and drinking it
I played this game for a solid 20 hours and managed to get the shit ending
I know it’s a lot thank u so much for these videos mark! it means so much
I’ve been waiting I’ve been tempted to spoil the ending for myself omfg
hey, mark i have to say if you get all the upgrades for freddy there is a true/canon ending... first you need to go to roxys raceway in the construction sites there is a fence that freddy can break and that's where you should find the ture/canon ending - Brahamy
Marks fnaf series is the only series I actively tune into
I had been waiting for him to post all day 🥲
EARLY GANGGGG
Seeing mark rage just makes my day😂😂😂❤️
I’ve been waiting all day for this ‼️
IVE BEEN WAITINGGGGG
I hope Mark is not mad, because the Taki people had ninja on the commerical instead of him, should've played Fortnite.
this is the reason why i had motivation to wake up today
Early finaly
finally
Don't leave the game, there is a super secret canon ending that you have to see. It is hard to get, but with a guide showing steps you will do it no problem.
I like how freddy was just ranting about his eyes
Lets go!!
Wait is that secret end or good end? Edit : he was indeed his super stat
“what happened” *good question*
Why did Vanessa sound like she was trying the seduce a small child?
glamrock freddy has my heart
Their is a secret room that you need Monty hands and Chica voice  and fax camera for
100k+ views in 10 minutes my lord
Hola
Yessss early
m
Just 30 min whyyy tell meee WWHYYYYYYY
“What’re you doing here? I haven’t even done the intro yet!” You’re right! I’m never this early to a new video but I can’t get enough of security breach
Waiting for each new episode really brings me back to 2014 lol. It's weird to think about how much Mark and even I have grown since then. Yall are the best <3
All Ending  Star 1 Bad Ending  Star 2 Bad Good Ending  Star 3 Happy Good Ending
I wonder, mark, if perhaps the reason you perceive and present yourself as the king of FNAF is because you identify with the animatronics. Is it to far to suggest that you, a content creator, perform for children and your masters whether you like it or not? that daily, you receive an immeasurable reward for your efforts on meaningless games? Whether your own mind supports this, in some attempt to retain freedom through your own slavery, or perhaps your overlords enforce it, or even your peers, deep down you do mirror them. perhaps, somewhere in your soul, you are the king of FNAF. The master of this series, yet, never the master of your own life.
I actually just caught up to this series like 30 minutes before you uploaded
Lot of "what happened" this eps. lol. Great series.
i’ve been waiting all day
Yesss sir
Hello my name is mqrkiplier
I can see why it took longer than expected for this one to arrive
I just got done with the previous episode. Nice.
I seen the upload of Security Breach and I was summoned here.
Freddy was taking them time to mess with Mark by taking his sweet time after his idea of shoving a beak in him
Vanessas "come to the main stage for a .... Surprise" line is gonna have way too much .... Art.... Made of it
Lol literally just finished the 6th part, 13 mintues late to this one XD
D
watching mark grow through this videos was so interesting to me. forever love this series
I want to see Mark do the other endings
Lets go
This series of videos from Mark is one of the greatest Christmas gifts.
YOOOO IM EARLY
1 ending down, 5 more to go.
YAY!!
WOOOOOOOOOOOO
YESSSSSSS, U DA BEST MARKIPLIER  markiplier screaming blood curdling murder as he calls for freddy is hilarious man, he probably isn't gonna say good boy to freddy anymore
Finally
Man what happened to the game in inscription you completely forgot about that game man
Freddy said “ fuck this shit, your on your own” *as he walks into the room*
Ayy
Yeeeeeih, I LOVE your videos Mark
Have I really gotten to the point where I sit on the youtube homepage constantly refreshing to see if this video posted
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I was waiting for this- I probably reset mark’s YouTube page twenty times within the past hour. Love this series, don’t know what but something about it is special
I was waiting 5 hours
Woooooo
I really enjoy watching let's plays while I knit - so just know I've been getting so much knitting done this week! The shawl for my mom is almost done!
Was waiting for this for the whole day
28:40 that killed me
Bro I was waiting all day. I was watching my phone like a hawk
cheeky
Yes yes yes yes yes
Just got home from  a 12 hour shift at the supermarket this is all I needed
I honestly, genuinely think this is the worst, buggiest, FNAF game first release we've ever seen, which is honestly incredibly disappointing.
I hate moon. I am more for sun than moon. But my favorite over all is roxy. Follow by freddy and sun
It's me
He is growing faster
I'm a simple guy. I see FNAF: Security Breach, I click.
Bruh Freddy had one job
Mark: “Vanny? What’s this choice?” *clicks it* Me: *existential dread*
Yessssirrr
Hey Mark no spoilers but there is a cannon ending and the best ending  The best Ending: go play princess quest 2 again, and then do Vanny choice( either at the door or loading docks) and then play it normally, and you will be able to play princess quest 3 in vanny’s room to unlock the best ending  Cannon ending: do monty’s route to get the freddy upgrade, then go back to roxy’s raceway. In the raceway, on your left when entering is a door leading down. You can open the gates when you have all of freddy’s upgrades take the elevator and good luck!  Also im a huge fan of yours been rocking with you since fnaf 4 please help Mark see this so he can make another video of security breach!
this is pretty cool
i screamed when u posted. obsessed with you playin fnaf lol
Yay im early cant wait to watch
Been refreshing every hour
Freddy: dies Mark: 😂😂😂😂
Freddy be like:  Look at me running a marathon.
Oml YES FINNALY
MARK I'VE BEEN WAITING DIDN'T SLEEP
I love when a new one comes out I get so happy
ABOUT TIME MARK! Been waiting all day!
Can't wait to not be able to sleep for the rest of the month
Please do videos of all endings mark
ahhh im early for once!! im so obsessed with his series!! 💜
✨
I don't appreciate being called out for seeing this early, Mark. Cmon, man.
E
Bad Children MUST be found.  Hehehehe
a
Merry christmas to everybody!
0 hour gang where you at
SLAYYY
I WAS WAITING FOR THIS OMG FINALLY TY MARK
been waiting all morning for this let's go
Oh I think you dropped this mister plier 👑
That moment when Five Nights at Freddys is Six Hours with Freddy!
Hi mark
Let's goo
marpiklier
7:45
The confusion with mark while he did the vanny ending
hi
I love how we've all collectively been waiting for this all day
Mark is such a talented person, he has made ppl all over the place smile for years. Keep being great mark😊😊
"i'm just curious.." mark's fatal flaw 😔
11 minutes ago yeeeeesh I’ve never been so early
Boop
Yay it took me long enough to notice :D
Damn the way Freddy just ditches mark
oh nice no intro. :>
Waited all day for this! I went to binge watch the fnaf series!!
Just started binge watching this today and this got posted halfway into part 6 :)
Never have I ever been so early to a video
ten minutes ago lets goooooo
i finished the 6th, scrolled up to reload, and here it is.
It’s the middle of the night wtf
Da baby animatronic
ligit couldn't wait for this
I HAVE BEEN WAITING EVERY SINGLE 10 MINS IHAVE BEEN CHECKING ON THIS VID BUT YOU FINALLY POSTED IT THANK U
Hearing freddy’s little footsteps while mark runs around like a maniac looking for him is where my anxiety peaks the most
Freddy: THESE ARE ROXY'S EYES?!?! Also Freddy: These new eyes are amazing!
This game has/had something and then it fumbles the execution.              fuckin comic book ending, goodness...
Amazing intro, just gotta say
120K IN 12 MINUTES?!!!?!!!
Ty Mark, I was waiting this since 1 Am...  *T H A N K S*
IVE BEEN WAITING ALL MORNING FOR THIS ITS FINALLY HERE
Mark makes me day so much. My grandpa is the hospital for the 3 time this month. Watching him makes me feel better and relax. Thank you Mark, Thank you so much
I know people are excited over security breach but I hope the inscryption series gets finished soon
Mark screaming at Freddy at the end was absolutely hilarious
I haven’t been this early in years
Wow
I'm fast af boiiii
12minutes
Mark is just my favourite YouTuber! Doesn't matter what he plays I enjoy it lol
It’s kind of weird having the same time as the game
glizzy gussy gobler
I think Mark forgot that Freddy said he couldn’t hide from Moondrop in a charging station this time
Iv been bingeing the previous games all day untill now
Mark be spooky
Love the content dude!, freddy is scary lol
Oh NOooooo. He got the badish ending. Btw how did he get Monty's hands on Freddy? I don't remember him fighting Monty.
Like how it told him he could not use the chargers and he ignored it lol
Everyone has been waiting patiently for this video
What kind of high quality security just lets a psycho moon man reek havoc on any children left behind like wtf 😭
Mark just tries to look so far into the details, he just ends up fucking up majorly trying to do the same thing during an hour straight. Then he goes insane. - My personal dictionary, definition of modern entertainment.  Edit : Also he doesn't listen to the instructions and ends up loosing more time. For instance, Freddy did mention that the recharge stations will be offline, but he still tries to enter one to get away from Moon...
Sppooooookokookkkyyyyy
Moon man: "I'm finna end this mans whole career"
pog
Freddy is such a good father figure in my mind.
I’ve been waiting for this the entire day! Mark left us on a click hanger man don’t do that again 😤 In all serious I hope you’re enjoying the game, Mark!
The moments in 28:00 are just pure chaos lmfao Edit: 28:44 best rouge like experience
Never clicked on a video so fast😂
LETSGOOO
Mark is sacrificing his sanity to make these videos to entertain us. Keep up the good work Mark.
Hey future people ... hey... Scott cawthon hey grandplier
5:09 Me watching him rage at Freddy: lol 😂
AAAAHH HERE WITHIN THE FIRST HOUR
YAYYY UOU FINALLY POSTEDD
Thank you for putting so much work into these videos ❤️💕

The waiting  was worth it
The FNAF God is back

i am so happy to be early
Ive been waiting for this ALL DAY im so hooked on what happens next and i love to sit with you for the ride!
So many comments in 12 minutes
"Vanny is a red herring"  Anyone with deeper knowledge of the lore, "Yes, but actually no. It's- complicated."
yess 11 mins
Up since 8:30 waiting for this
AHHHHHH
YESSSS I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!!!!
Mark did it out of order when you put in Roxy’s eyes it starts the very end of the night and the thing from Vanessa is something from earlier in the game he skipped I think
What's with the glitter-vision?
LETS GOOOO
Yo why this game a glitchy broken mess?
Mmmm suffering
I love this series!!!! Keep it up!!!!
YES just YES with all the fnaf sb!
I couldn't stop laughing when freddy wasn't coming to Mark
Okay this was amazing and all thanks Just please don’t forget Inscryption pretty please
so excited
there’s 7 confirmed endings i’m pretty sure, one being a very cool secret ending!! :) i’ve seen it and was very shocked
Thank you bro
YES I WAS WAITING!!!!! Thank you for this amazing series.
THANK YOU MARK
I love to see him genuinely enjoying the game. Takes me all the way back to his old fnaf days.
I died when Freddy just dipped on Mark
Who else was having a convo from the last video while waiting for this to be posted lmaooo
Omg I have been waiting all day Yay
Holy 4k comments already
HES HEREEEE
nice
This series is watching Mark slowly descend into madness
HELLO IM EARLY WOOO
Hype dude
I am getting Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 tomorrow
IM 10 MINUTES LATE LETS FUCKING GOOGOGOGOGOOGOGO
It’s out let’s GO. Genuinely highlight of my day.
man finally i’m so hyped for this game
POG
11mins ago
So fast
*clicks on video immediately after its posted*  mark : “WUT r u doin here ur early”
Idiocity should be a diseace
I think that went to comic strips because Vanny is made of fleshy human bits so "disassembling" her would not be something I'd put my animation team through animating.
Always hypet
Mark playing Five Nights at Freddy's always makes me happy to see! He is amazing at any FNAF game.
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
You now have to get the canon ending
FIANLLLYYY YAYYY THANK YOU MARKK
Waited all day for this 😈
Mark you should do the Princess quest ending
your mother
markiplier has hired a shitposter
Was waiting to see this upload you don’t even know
Ive been waiting all fucking day for this haha i just want to know what happens in this game!
Finished yesterday's video and have been waiting!!
I got so scared when he got jumped scared by vanny. XD
Remember when FNaF was supposed to be a single game? Then it was supposed to end on the third game? Then the fourth? Then the fifth?
Security Breach is such a very nice gift from Mark this Christmas. Thanks Markkkkkk!!!!!!
18:07 getting ripped apart as an animatronic is a lot less gory and grim as opposed to a human getting ripped apart so maybe that’s why they did the comic thing instead then again there could’ve been blood in the comic too
Bruh it sounds like markiplier has  Asthma    At 18:03
What is up mark
Just in time, i was mourning about not knowing what unus annus was in 2019
Literally just watched the last episode,  didnt know what to do so I went bonkers going through yt , and the this showed up to save my night
*GOoD NEWs It’s aLL M0sT a CoCk* - Freddy Fazbear
I check ever 4 mins every day for these. Thanks for posting these :)
About time
I love the edits in this series.
This is so awesome 🔥🔥🔥 And Mark Merry Christmas Eve hope you have a great time with your family and friends and take care 🎄🎄🎄🔥🔥🔥🔥
Finallyyy
They ran out of budget LOL
DO NOT pick the Vanny ending after getting all upgrades. There IS another ending involving the arcade machine that you accidentally didn’t see in Vanny’s room, but it has absolutely nothing to do with your upgrades. You need all 3 upgrades to get another ending involving opening a secret door and going down an elevator and... 😉
I love watching Mark play this 🤣
is it bad that i was waiting for the past couple hours for this to come out
Who else has been refreshing Mark's page in between random videos, just...waiting.
kinda early
i have been waiting for this the whole day
uploaded this as i finished the last one lol
I'm far too invested in this series help💀💀
Good news! It is almost a clock!
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ALL DAY
the sheer ANGUISH the stars on the screen cause me is immaculate /lh/hj i keep squinting thinking it'll help me see and then it's like oh no i still can't edit: I AM SOBBING.
Man I miss waking up to a Markiplier FNAF video, good times and now I can do that again
Just spent all day waiting for this!!
Don’t forget the Princess Quest ending Mark 👀
This is the best mark fnaf series that i've ever seen
That Vanny= Red Hareing was SO clever, I didn't even realize!
FINALLY

Markiplier: “What are you doing here so early?”  Also Mark: “I haven’t even done my Hello intro yet.”
sheesh
I stayed up all night to wake up late just so I wouldn’t have to wait in the morning lmao
i just finished watching part six and was peeved that 7 wasn't out  XD
Yesss been waiting alll dayyyy

I was early and you yelled at me for being early, I'm sorry
Watching the video 9 minutes after it was posted and have mark say "you're early" was a big shock
Also when are the Inscryption Videos coming again....

Only me waiting all day for this?🤡
I was waiting for so long 😭
I'm so early there isn't a jumpscare list sigh
To get the main stage ending thing you have to enter the lift but not go to another floor then basically survive on the main stage till 6 am, you should be able to activate that route this way. (Also yes the time does pass it will just feel like for ever)
"Good news! It is almost a cock!" Really got me, more than it should've
FINALLY
Good news, it is almost a rooster ! Yes !
I have been waiting all day heck ya

Joe
THE ONLY FUCKING REASON WHY I COME ON YT IS FOR MARK AND THE SECURITY BREACH😭😭💀 IVE BEEN WAITING THIS WHOLE TIME AND ITS FINALLY OUT
Ive been pacing in my room for the past hour for this moment
I’ve never clicked a notification so fast in my life
It’s not a Security Breach video without Mark stopping to explain his pain and suffering of trying to figure out the game
this shit is crazy. but the story stopped after pizzeria simulator <3
I'm hella early this time
ayyyyyy
Always love your videos, Mark! Your reactions are always the funniest to watch

m a r k
HE UPLOADED
So excited for this episode. Mark’s definitely gonna have to deal with killer Freddy after he has all his upgrades XD
I've been on YouTube all day waiting for this 😭
This honestly makes me feel so much better my dog passed away today and this really helps me take my mind of things thanks mark ❤️
Toadally Tubular!!!
FINALLY
I WAS WAITING THE WHOLE DAY AND I WAS JUST GOING TO WACH SOMETHING ELSE AND THEN I SAW THAT U UPLOADED IT I LOVE U SOO MUCH MA FREDNO 💓 💗 💖 ♥ ❤
yo, Video spoils.   I just realized, when Vanessa says "come to the main stage" You have to hear her voice line before going to the exit, or you will not have the option Back to explaining  It means, you have to ignore her for a bit and go directly to the exit, not the main stage. After that you get to the exit, you have the option to choose Leave, Stay, Or Vanny. Choosing vanny apparently means Freddy dies and vanny dies. What i get from the stars, 1 star means "Not cannon"  2 stars mean "Could possibly be cannon but aren't, and 3 stars (i think the only one with 3 stars is the afton ending, tell me if im wrong) Means "Cannon ending"
Just so you know, there are 6 ending in this game
Only just finished episode 6 nice, great timing
I love his reactions
FINALLLYYYYY
the moment i wake up and take a look at yt, there's this, glorious
wow this was fast
the nostalgia i get from watching his fnaf videos again.. couldnt ask for anything better
oh boy
3:13 Worth.
I love this series
The way I repeatedly refreshed for an hour because of the cliffhanger of the last episode 💀
A
The elevator music gets me everytime
Ayeeee just finished watching fnaf 3 by you. Cool to see new episode!
Epic
EARLIEST I HAVE EVER BEEN
I just got my wisdom teeth pulled today and i watched marks Wisdom teeth video to prepare myself.
Video has 69k views Me: Nice
Man I almost went to sleep cause i thought there was no episode today but now I guess no sleep for me
Good news, its almost a cock
I have been reloading on YouTube all day, just so I can see this vid as soon as possible!
I just kept waiting for the new video the second the last one hit ‘uploaded 1 day ago’
XD You're early! Yes...but...but.  I'm not usually this early!!  Thank you for uploading these so often, I adore the Markiplier FNAF adventures!
Lets gooo
lol that intro makes me think he talking to me directly cause i clicked on this so fast
Watching in 2 times speed and paying extra attention so I can spoil the end
Yes, the daily wait is over!
Watch this be a crossover between FNAF & Diary of the Wimpy kid. This is Greg's childhood. this is why he has so many fears. it all makes sense now
LET'S GO, that's exactly why I'm staying up late. I'll excitedly watch this and then I'll be scared to even go to the bathroom :)          But it's worth it tho
i waiting for this all day eeeeee!
been waiting all day
The intro is hella hilarious, mark never gets old! 😂
Mark givin us 30 min vid lame
waited for this all day mark
We all need help.
Oh man I'm so excited!! Thanks Mark! Take a break on Christmas though, please!
It’s illegal to be this early
Amazing vids, Mark
Get good end.

Finally
Mark thank you for your content-my cat falls asleep listening to your videos))))
Markiplier, the King of King's of Fnaf
HELP??! #? [#? #! I LITERALLY JUST FINISHED WATCHING PART 6
Hello everyone from the prev videos comment section 😂🙋‍♂️
AHHH I'M SO EARLY
Freddy: Hey Superstar I'll keep you safe Also Freddy: *Runs in the wrong direction* Mark: FREDDY!!!
Been refreshing all day for this vid it’s the only plans I made😂
My favourite thing still has to be Mark calling out for Freddy with increasing distress every time he fails to show up, especially when you can see Freddy running around in the background like a lost puppy
Never clicked on a video so fast, much love mark
FINALLY THE MAN POSTED
am i the only one noticing he’s starting to upload these alot later?
mark is still the king of fnaf in my head =D
FINALLY CAME OUT IVE BEEN WAITING LOL
Finnaly
This is probably the earliest I've been to Mark's videos, but I'm curios about the game but for nostalgia want to watch mark complete it first before any one else
YES! I’ve waited for this!
IT feels good to be one of the first people to watch this episode
"you're early!" why thank you, i know.
Yes yes yes it’s outttt
hey mark this didnt show on my home screen same with the last 2 just letting u know
I don't care if the game is buggy. I'm hooked on this game. And love watching Mark lose his mind.
Imagine this game in vr
i haven’t watched the full but if u haven’t try shooting freddy in the eyes with ur gun
Hey Mark. If you stay in Parts and Service, you should be able to go down a hole in the floor. I believe it is parts and Service anyways. There is a secret ending involving that hole. Like, a big, BIG, secret ending. Remember the notes about something going on under the Pizzaplex? That’s because it is a ‘secret ending’.
Hey, Markiplier, did you know that your oneshot play through isn't finished?
Yay
I wait for it like a dog waiting for its master
Mark should’ve won the streamys
Mark you are confusing hims :(
I swear half of marks reactions can easily be turned into meme templates
I’ve been refreshing my page for the past hour waiting for this! So excited
5:10 I D I E D when he was just telling at freddy.
Wow
You’re my superstar almost got me 😭😭
6 mins lol

Bro you bozos live in his house how is there 3.4K comments in three minutes
im dying for every video
Freddy: "Nothing can hide from me now!" Roxy in past episodes: *literally stares at Mark in a basket and can't see him*
At the same time i don’t want him to beat it because for years I have watched Markiplier one of my top favorite let’s plays or game series that he has played is fnaf
I’VE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY
HELL YEAH, I'M NOT THAT SAD ANYMORE
FINALLY IVE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY FOR THIS!!! Can’t wait to see what part he gets stuck on now😌
Have to appreciate how he's uploaded a video everyday since part 1
I just finished the last video wondering what I was gonna do until he dropped the next one and then he read my mind
i have never been this early haha
Holy shit 4 minutes and 3700 comments
Freddy: good news! It is almost a *cock*
5 minutes ago amd already 3.7k comments lmfao
Yoooo
dude i wait staring & refreshing yt until he posts every day
Finally
Hey
Szfftiieeeeeeeeeeee
Wow so many likes already only five mins
is it bad that i literally have been waiting for this to come out, maybe cause i have nothing in my life to do during break
hehe siuuuu
Oh yeah these videos keep coming out later and later
ive been waiting all day for this😩😩
*Me continuously reloading my yt page and see mark posted*: MY TIME HAS COME
2:53 The noise in the background is all you hear when I'm doing "Service" to Chika.
Like for Mark to lose his sanity doing the True Ending
i'm surprised this comment section isn't filled with those annoying verified mr beast bots
Nice
fnaf is so good and mark is amazing
"I refuse it to be the end"  Multiple Endings: Oh but it *isn't*
Markimoo!! There are CDs scattered throughout the game. You need to find those for some of the lore. Hope you see this xx
first
YES
i've BEEN WAITING !!
WOOOO IM SO EXCITED I WAS WAITING FOR THIS ALL DAY
ok
i’ve been waiting and checking every so often for this to finally drop
Why am I early because I'm devoted to your videos mark, accept the idea that you have fans mark, you should have given the bare minimum mark, *continues ranting*
I've just been sitting on youtube all day waiting for another one of your videos, haha.

Helllo
Why am I always so early to these? Lol 😂

I don’t want it to end omg

Based on how loud and heavy Freddy is, I'm pretty sure he can beat down the other animatronics.   Especially the moon dude, literally a stick
Best part of my day
love u
I have been waiting
Early
Wait, we're early?
I didn't get the notification :/
I’m early
Freddy is such a good boy and you know he loves Mark cause he keeps doin little tippy taps!
Go on lad
this series is valid like everything else mark posts
early on accident
markiplier releasing these videos every day up to Christmas is the best advent calendar I could’ve asked for
Markiplier is like that one subscriber who you feel like is a relative to you and you love his content so much!
too bad im early mark >:D
Been waiting all day, so exited!
for once that I’m here early to watch security breach mark goes "what are you doing here, you’re early" I felt called out??
Ayyyy
Waiting all day for this one!! So excited!!
thers so many people already LOL this is the highlight of my day honestly
mark has amazing videos, no one can disagree to that
"A H H H" - Markiplier
God for some reason that intro really got me🤣
POV:crying cause mark finally uploaded
Markiplier came a long way
been waiting for this one, I already had my food ready an hour ago XD
BRO…..
I was refreshing his acc waiting fo this episode
Cool
i was literally sat reloading my screen for this.
YES YES FINALLY THANK GOD, I want to see how it ends sooo bad
FINALLY, Ah Mark I love you so much. Thank you c:
I’ve been checking every hour to make sure mark uploaded a new final video
not first!
Here’s a jumpscare list I’ll update as I watch! 3:36 Moon but only sound 7:31 Moon but only sound again 10:47 Moon 12:25 Moon 27:53 Security bot 28:28 Security bot 29:15 Monty That’s all! Have a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!
Hello Markiplier, this is everyone else.
Early
I don’t think I’ve ever been this early
Hey mark i know a secret ending the way to ok get it is go to the fazar tag game and Parkour on the walls to get to the staircase from then go up the staircase and go into Vannny’s   room and there is a button press the button and then you will get the secret ending
The fact that I’ve been waiting for this every night this week, this brings back so much nostalgia 😌
4 minutes in and 45 plus k people already watching
Top tier gameplay as usual💯
saw this when vid was only 3 mins uploaded
Imaging loading Mark's YT page every 5 minutes hoping that he uploaded.
New fnaf vid Pog
finally wtf i waited for 4 hourssssssss
WOOO
Markipliers thumbnails are always really good, does he make them himself?
finally
i just ended the 6th omg
i was watching "what would happen if" security breach vids while waiting for this thanks mark you always come thru
I got spidie senses or something because I thought "I need to check if markiplier uploaded" and now we're here  Edit: mark, you can change the vanny ending by playing princess quest! You need to play the first two, and then select the vanny ending. You'll find the third one in her office!
Let’s all agree that mark is still the king of five nights of Freddy’s
Yay part 7 I've been avoiding spoilers for this
IVE BEEN WAITING ALL DAY FOR THE NEW VID, THANK YOU MARKK!!!
WOOOOO
No views, 64 likes, three comments, YouTube is tripping again-
I had just finished part 6 and immediately saw this posted 2 mins ago

Honestly love the energy between roxy and markiplier fav duo lol
I haven't watched anything else related to FNAF because I didn't want spoliers.
