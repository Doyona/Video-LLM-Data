Judge my soul not my skin.  I asked 21 Savage for a Ferrari he couldn't hear me talking to my tv. Shame I ain't got no friends to help me out with some stuff.

Jason Man say, I-I feel good, nigga And it's you know, my first time bein' on the mic, nigga (Went to jail came home) Who am I? Like, who was I? You know, I guess words don't even matter You know we movin' forward Went to jail came home, time passed went back again All the pain I felt inside myself, thought it would never end I just thought I would blame myself, can't even blame my friends I was critizin' myself like, "you ain't never gon' win" Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it" I'm like DeSean, thuggin' you just hustlin' backwards Nigga, you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh I can feel it in my soul They say that he ain't gon' be here long I see myself on top the mountain I'm smoking strong, I'm keeping strong No more ridin' with that window down Hangin' out tryna lay them down My soul, I still ain't think I found When I tell bro on the phone I ain't even been worried 'bout no jewelry now So my girl don't want her a bust down I ain't even been worried 'bout the jury now I been wanna do right since I touched down I been watchin' the way I influence now I ain't post not a picture, I moved on I'm responsible to all these children now Even though they label me tough 'lone Back into my normal home Back inside my closet puttin' that Vlone on Daughter born, I had to listen while sittin' on the phone First time got her in my arms like, "I can't leave you alone" With all these thoughts on top my dome Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it" I'm like DeSean, thuggin' you just hustlin' backwards Nigga, you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh I can feel it in my soul I ain't beefin' wit' all these niggas, don't even mention me They gon' kill me if they can No need for dissin', come get rid of me I'm grown now, I'm a man So tell them ain't no time for sympathy I been holdin' all these bands I don't give a fuck bout who not feelin' me Or into me, intimate, not no consistency She ain't into me, yeah Havin' you, you don't know what it meant to me It ain't get to me, nah, every time that you said you ain't shit to me Even though you meant the world to me Goin' straight even though you curvin' me I ain't worried 'bout all that courtesy Heart on top my shoulder now I'ma sleep on top Burberry sheets Can't take no pill but I'm rollin' now Can't drink no lean but I'm focused now Can't smoke no dope but I'm loaded now Can't tote no gun but I'm strapped right now Lil top on top of the map right now Been dead but nigga I'm back right now Keepin' this shit on track right now I don't take no Adderall Pure washing make my feelings dissolve Phone ring, I decline that call Where its trouble, I get back with y'all My hair hang on top my eyes, it fall Through the rain, I'm seeing through all this fog Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it" I'm like DeSean, thuggin' you just hustlin' backwards Nigga, you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh I can feel it in my soul

You know, I guess words don't even matter You know we movin' forward Went to jail came home, time passed went back again All the pain I felt inside myself, thought it would never end I just thought I would blame myself, can't even blame my friends I was critizin' myself like, "you ain't never gon' win" Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it" I'm like DeSean, thuggin' you just hustlin' backwards Nigga, you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh I can feel it in my soul They say that he ain't gon' be here long I see myself on top the mountain I'm smoking strong, I'm keeping strong No more ridin' with that window down Hangin' out tryna lay them down My soul, I still ain't think I found When I tell bro on the phone I ain't even been worried 'bout no jewelry now So my girl don't want her a bust down I ain't even been worried 'bout the jury now I been wanna do right since I touched down I been watchin' the way I influence now I ain't post not a picture, I moved on I'm responsible to all these children now Even though they label me tough 'lone Back into my normal home Back inside my closet puttin' that Vlone on Daughter born, I had to listen while sittin' on the phone First time got her in my arms like, "I can't leave you alone" With all these thoughts on top my dome Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it" I'm like DeSean, thuggin' you just hustlin' backwards Nigga, you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh I can feel it in my soul I ain't beefin' wit' all these niggas, don't even mention me They gon' kill me if they can No need for dissin', come get rid of me I'm grown now, I'm a man So tell them ain't no time for sympathy I been holdin' all these bands I don't give a fuck bout who not feelin' me Or into me, intimate, not no consistency She ain't into me, yeah Havin' you, you don't know what it meant to me It ain't get to me, nah, every time that you said you ain't shit to me Even though you meant the world to me Goin' straight even though you curvin' me I ain't worried 'bout all that courtesy Heart on top my shoulder now I'ma sleep on top Burberry sheets Can't take no pill but I'm rollin' now Can't drink no lean but I'm focused now Can't smoke no dope but I'm loaded now Can't tote no gun but I'm strapped right now Lil top on top of the map right now Been dead but nigga I'm back right now Keepin' this shit on track right now I don't take no Adderall Pure washing make my feelings dissolve Phone ring, I decline that call Where its trouble, I get back with y'all My hair hang on top my eyes, it fall Through the rain, I'm seeing through all this fog Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it" I'm like DeSean, thuggin' you just hustlin' backwards Nigga, you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh I can feel it in my soul

השיר הזה באמת❤️‍🔥
I'm ashamed to say I judged you just by your look. I never took the time to listen to ya lyrics and wrote you off as another rap figure that derails the integrity of the youth keeping us stuck in the same cycle. I understand you're just tryna find ya soul and your past was just simply playing the hand you were dealt at birth. I apologize and hope you continue towards the light.
i love u
Happy New Years🎉🎉

You know, I guess words don't even matter You know we movin' forward Went to jail came home, time passed went back again All the pain I felt inside myself, thought it would never end I just thought I would blame myself, can't even blame my friends I was critizin' myself like, "you ain't never gon' win" Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it" I'm like DeSean, thuggin' you just hustlin' backwards Nigga, you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh I can feel it in my soul They say that he ain't gon' be here long I see myself on top the mountain I'm smoking strong, I'm keeping strong No more ridin' with that window down Hangin' out tryna lay them down My soul, I still ain't think I found When I tell bro on the phone I ain't even been worried 'bout no jewelry now So my girl don't want her a bust down I ain't even been worried 'bout the jury now I been wanna do right since I touched down I been watchin' the way I influence now I ain't post not a picture, I moved on I'm responsible to all these children now Even though they label me tough 'lone Back into my normal home Back inside my closet puttin' that Vlone on Daughter born, I had to listen while sittin' on the phone First time got her in my arms like, "I can't leave you alone" With all these thoughts on top my dome Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it" I'm like DeSean, thuggin' you just hustlin' backwards Nigga, you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh I can feel it in my soul I ain't beefin' wit' all these niggas, don't even mention me They gon' kill me if they can No need for dissin', come get rid of me I'm grown now, I'm a man So tell them ain't no time for sympathy I been holdin' all these bands I don't give a fuck bout who not feelin' me Or into me, intimate, not no consistency She ain't into me, yeah Havin' you, you don't know what it meant to me It ain't get to me, nah, every time that you said you ain't shit to me Even though you meant the world to me Goin' straight even though you curvin' me I ain't worried 'bout all that courtesy Heart on top my shoulder now I'ma sleep on top Burberry sheets Can't take no pill but I'm rollin' now Can't drink no lean but I'm focused now Can't smoke no dope but I'm loaded now Can't tote no gun but I'm strapped right now Lil top on top of the map right now Been dead but nigga I'm back right now Keepin' this shit on track right now I don't take no Adderall Pure washing make my feelings dissolve Phone ring, I decline that call Where its trouble, I get back with y'all My hair hang on top my eyes, it fall Through the rain, I'm seeing through all this fog Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it" I'm like DeSean, thuggin' you just hustlin' backwards Nigga, you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh I can feel it in my soul

" right inside my 👖 where I tot that heat" 🩸
The change of this song will forever shock me 😂🔥 I will never be ready for the change up
home, time passed went back again All the pain I felt inside myself, thought it would never end I just thought I would blame myself, can't even blame my friends I was critizin' myself like, "you ain't never gon' win"  Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it" I'm like DeSean, thuggin' you just hustlin' backwards Nigga, you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh I can feel it in my soul  They say that he ain't gon' be here long I see myself on top the mountain I'm smoking strong, I'm keeping strong No more ridin' with that window down Hangin' out tryna lay them down My soul, I still ain't think I found When I tell bro on the phone I ain't even been worried 'bout no jewelry now So my girl don't want her a bust down I ain't even been worried 'bout the jury now I been wanna do right since I touched down I been watchin' the way I influence now I ain't post not a picture, I moved on I'm responsible to all these children now Even though they label me tough 'lone Back into my normal home Back inside my closet puttin' that Vlone on Daughter born, I had to listen while sittin' on the phone First time got her in my arms like, "I can't leave you alone" With all these thoughts on top my dome  Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it" I'm like DeSean, thuggin' you just hustlin' backwards Nigga, you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh I can feel it in my soul  I ain't beefin' wit' all these niggas, don't even mention me They gon' kill me if they can No need for dissin', come get rid of me I'm grown now, I'm a man So tell them ain't no time for sympathy I been holdin' all these bands I don't give a fuck bout who not feelin' me Or into me, intimate, not no consistency She ain't into me, yeah Havin' you, you don't know what it meant to me It ain't get to me, nah, every time that you said you ain't shit to me Even though you meant the world to me Goin' straight even though you curvin' me I ain't worried 'bout all that courtesy Heart on top my shoulder now I'ma sleep on top Burberry sheets Can't take no pill but I'm rollin' now Can't drink no lean but I'm focused now Can't smoke no dope but I'm loaded now Can't tote no gun but I'm strapped right now Lil top on top of the map right now Been dead but nigga I'm back right now Keepin' this shit on track right now I don't take no Adderall Pure washing make my feelings dissolve Phone ring, I decline that call Where its trouble, I get back with y'all My hair hang on top my eyes, it fall Through the rain, I'm seeing through all this fog  Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it" I'm like DeSean, thuggin' you just hustlin' backwards Nigga, you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh I can feel it in my soul

He breaks through the matrix.

Best rapper
Live Media Screen
Maine dis nigga the fuckn TRUTH !!! He different from des rappers he hit hard this Nigga talented azz fuck
Is this what the youth really listen too? All of these rituals how they condition you claiming they hard but soft as a kissing booth doubt it aint nobody missing you, even kno god made me spiritual ima get lyrical reaching my pinochle stretchin like tentacles after I finish u you'll need a miracle lets take it biblical! Jesus he died for ya he put the sun in the sky for ya tell him to open yo 👀 for ya, get off the top of your pyramid u say that u the "goat" but u still a kid, u get it? Goats are kids ghost is here coast is clear open ears, I'm swinging on Babe Ruth this is your exit jus phase 2 u gone be gettin the plagues too I see you droppin that rodd down but im bout to bring out the snake too. God the speed on light you a bike 6speeds u aint god u split blunts he split seas, he built the arch the only arch u kno is Micky D's #9 large soda fries dnt forget the cheese, we bout to go home soon its only so long you can kee kee kee cook this dude give the news he's jus food EBT, roadblock on easy streak and if u lookin for me to speak too me I'm where Jesus be. I'm a livin Jesus piece u jus got a Jesus piece, manicure see the feet the puppet never sees the strings, if u tried to carry the cross you'd break your shoulder off the only thing i want from you is truth u gettin older boy returning to the vomit Jesus Christ is comin u say u read the scroll but u jus scrolling thru the comments, watch me while I brainstorm pharaoh say he free but he got chains on I cant expect you to be grown cause yo names young, I guarantee that ice wont save you when them flames come u look like everybody else u same song, pharaoh died in the bible chasing children of God u tellin half tooth so grab a seat so I can tell it all, pharaoh called magicians and they dropped the rodds then they faces got boils flies and the frogs, in the night took the 1st born life of them all young pharaoh he can dress yeah he fly as a frog, I see things and hear things like a fly on the Wall so abide by his laws and put some design in your flaws the designs in this cloth cant be found in no malls!     A wolf can only wear a sheeps clothing for sooo long they get hot and itchy and got to come up out of it haha
stay safe and blessed keep it up bro

YB taught me if anyone messes wit me to pull up lean out with a drako and lay em down. Yb taught me to sell drugs and kill to be successful. YB taught me to hit woman if they piss me off.  YB if the best influence. money over it all.

Son dis song make me think bout life seriously 💚🐍
really love his fits though!
Revisiting this four months on and it's still hard
Being Yb fan isn’t just a hobby, it’s a lifestyle, a reason to breathe, an escape from the cruel world filled with thieves. It’s art, the first gift you open on Christmas, a hug from a loved one, everything you’ve ever wanted, everything you need. Thank You Kentrell DeSean Gaulden. for this music to my ears
A lot of these rappers are really good at making personal heartfelt songs but they'd rather just talk about killing, drugs, and hoes. There's a reason for that but y'all ain't ready

I'ma sleep on top Burberry sheets Can't take no pill but I'm rollin' now Can't drink no lean but I'm focused now Can't smoke no dope but I'm loaded now Can't tote no gun but I'm strapped right now Lil Top on top of the map right now Been dead but nigga, I'm back right now Keepin' this shit on track right now I don't take no Adderall Pure washing make my feelings dissolve Phone ring, I decline that

Slatt
He talk about murder all day like he in GTA. Ain't nobody killing that much and not facing consequences. That's a lie!!! Go talk to some real OGs who are doing hard time. Young boi is as his name is he not a man he a young boi who is lost without Christ. Young boi to scared to follow Jesus. And he probably will say he don't believe in God or don't want to do it but deep inside he scared.
The Goat!! Do you know what happens to the goats when there time is up on earth and they stand before God. It so sad that young boy act like he in a gang and Baton Rouge Louisiana don't even bang or claim colors. J prince was right young boy living a lie. He just an entertainer getting money. illuminati's puppet until God requires His life. I wish we could see who young boy really is but he don't want Jesus to live in his heart because the life he living now with money and fame is a big distraction and he cant see clear until the day God slows him down and gets his undivided attention
U know what this one poppen slime
God protect Us while Listening To This Young Man Amen 🙏🏾

44  Du wartest auf die Erscheinung, die von draußen kommen soll, wie ein dir gleichender Erzengel. Hättest du von seinem Besuch mehr Gewinn gehabt als vom Besuch deines Nachbarn? Ich habe bemerkt, dass einer nicht mehr derselbe ist, der sich auf dem Weg zum kranken Kind, zum leeren Haus, zur Geliebten befindet, obwohl er im Augenblick nicht verändert zu sein scheint. So mache ich mich zum Stelldichein oder zum Ufer mit Hilfe der bestehenden Dinge, und dann ist alles verwandelt. Ich mache mich zum Korn über das Pflügen hinaus, zum Menschen über das Kind hinaus, zum Brunnen über die Wüste hinaus, zum Diamanten über den Schweiß hinaus.  Ich zwinge dich, in dir ein Haus zu bauen.  Wenn das Haus fertig ist, wird auch der Bewohner kommen, der dein Herz entflammt  Ich aber kenne gerechte Menschen, nicht die Gerechtigkeit. Freie Menschen und nicht die Freiheit. Menschen, die durch die Liebe beseelt werden, und nicht die Liebe. Desgleichen kenne ich weder die Schönheit noch das Glück, sondern nur glückliche Menschen und schöne Dinge. Doch zunächst galt es, zu wirken und zu bauen und zu lernen und zu erschaffen
love you you dad

YOUNGBOY///////////////////////////////////////////////////////2022//////////////////////////2060//////MUSIC
This nigga, no cap u can obviously tell wtf he’s sayin n goin thru. Even though every time he come outta jail it’s the same for him. Honestly I feel this time could’ve been a wake up call. Coming from this type shit. Cuz in case y’all ain’t noticed so many fucken rappers been either dead or locked up this year. Yeah even though 2021 been probably the worst year yet for the rap game. Y’all still see NBA young boy had a second chance. Idk maybe he’ll be the leader……. Who tf knows!
“Im like Desean thuggin, you just hustling backwards niqqa u done won. I jus felt accept that yur not good for anyone”🔥

You can be a gamer Yb
“Can’t even blame my friends”
Make a song about yo 2 daughters
I used to not like young boy at all but since ive took the time to actually sit down and listen to his music I have to admit he has grown on me. No denying the kid has talent and a bunch of hits. Surprised how many good songs he has its crazy i can see now why is he the most played and popular artist on YouTube. He has heart and this song is a perfect example. Started off with a slow song that's a hitter reminds us we are all human and make mistakes. Hes in his early twenties with millions of course he will make mistakes do some shit he probably didn't  think think thru all the way. Not to be so hard on the guy and so critical of him. Then switches it up to a straight gritty slapper that bangs. Hope he can stay out of jail and put the dumb shit away and focus on the music .
“green flag kno it ain’t no peach” didn’t ah nother rapper have a song called feelin’ peachy? oh ok 🤔

1st song got me like😩😢😭🧎🏽‍♂️ 2nd song got me like 🤬😈👹💢🔥
☝🏿✍🏿💪🏿💪🏿🖤⭐️3️⃣🌎🎥🎥
Never listened to his music until now and the only reason why is cuz I heard he likes wearing makeup cuz it makes him feel comfortable so I had to see what he’s about and his music! First song is alright but that second song alligator or whatever is awful! I guess this is the kind of music that the kids are listening to considering there I’ve 18 million views! I hope he doesn’t influence kids/boys/guys/men that wearing make up is normal cool and ok!!! Cuz it isn’t! Us real girls/women want a masculine boy/man not a feminine one!!!

**LYRICS** YoungBoy Never Broke Again | Went to jail came home (Jason!)  Man say, I-I feel good nigga, Alex you know  It's my first time bein' on the mic nigga  Went to jail came home, who am I  Aye, who is I, you know  I guess words dont even matter  You know we movin' forward   Went to jail came home, time passed went back again  All the pain I felt inside myself, thought it would never end  I just thought I would blame myself, can't even blame my friends  I was critizin' myself like, you ain't never gone' win Kentrell you got to man up, you done had all these kids  I'm like Kentrell you got to stand up, Its your time, I see it  I'm like Desaun, thuggin you just hustlin backwards Nigga you done won  I just felt accept that you not good for anyone  (Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh,)  I can feel it in my soul  They say that he ain't gon' be here long  I see myself on top the mountian  I'm smoking strong Im keeping strong  No more ridin' with that window down Hangin out tryna lay them down  My soul, I still ain't think I found  When I tell bro on the phone  I ain't even been worried 'bout no jewelry now  So my girl dont want her a bussed down  I ain't even been worried 'bout the jewelry now  I been wanna do right since I touched down  I been wathcin' the way I influence now  I ain't post not a picture, I moved on  I'm responsible to all these children now  Even though they label me tough love  Back into my normal home  Back inside my closet puttin' that Vlone on  Daughter born I had to listen while sittin' on the phone First time got her in my arms like, I can't leave you alone  With all these thoughts on top my dome  Kentrell you got to man up, you done had all these kids  I'm like Kentrell you got to stand up, Its your time, I see it  I'm like Desaun, thuggin you just hustlin backwards Nigga you done won  I just felt accept that you not good for anyone  (Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh,)  I can feel it in my soul  I ain't beefin' wit all these niggas, dont even mention me They gon' kill me if they can  No need for dissin', come get rid of me  I'm grown now, I'm a man  So tell them ain't no time for sympathy  I been holdin' all these bands  Don't give a fuck bout who not feelin' me  Or into me, intimate, not no consistency  She ain't into me, havin' you, you ain't know what it meant to me  It ain't get to me, naw, every time that you said you ain't shit to me  Even though you meant the world to me  Goin' straight even though you curvin' me  I ain't worried 'bout all that courtesy  Heart on top my shoulder now  Imma sleep on top Burberry sheets Can't take no pill but I'm rollin' na  Can't drink no lean but I'm focused na  Can't smoke no dope but I'm loaded na  Can't tote no gun but I'm strapped right na  Lil top on top of the map right na  Been dead but nigga I'm back right na  Keepin' this shit on track right na  I don't take no Adderall, [?] make my feelings dissolve  Phone ring I decline that call  Where its trouble, I get back with yall  My hair hang on top my eyes it fall  Through the rain, I'm seeing through all this fog  Kentrell you got to man up, you done had all these kids  I'm like Kentrell you got to stand up, Its your time, I see it  I'm like Desaun, thuggin you just hustlin backwards Nigga you done won  I just felt accept that you not good for anyone  (Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh,)  I can feel it in my soul  (No, Shawn, you passed the limit)  Cuttin' up, cuttin

❤ To you who is reading this, I just want to remind you told that God loves you and that he has a wonderful plan for your life!  God forbid If you died suddenly today, where do you think you would spend eternity??... If you are not sure, God wants to let you know that he loves you very much and that this is REAL LOVE — not that you loved God, but that he loved you FIRST by sending his Son Jesus to die for you to take away all of your sins that you would not perish but have everlasting LIFE!   Gods love for you cannot be measured, it has no boundaries and will look past all your faults. God saved me and set me free from a lifestyle of sin and addiction back a few years ago and my life has never been the same since. God can do the same for you if you allow him. You have a choice, but just know that YOU ARE GODS CHOICE. And though the world may change, his love for you will NEVER CHANGE! God wants a RELATIONSHIP with you! Its not too late! He loves you!  The bible says in Romans 6:23 that the  wages of Sin is DEATH! But the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord and Saviour!! Romans 10:9 & 13 says that WHO EVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF JESUS AND BELIEVES IN THEIR HEART AND CONFESSES WITH THEIR MOUTH THAT HE IS LORD SHALL BE SAVED!!  Im going to say a prayer for you! Lord bless my friend and their family with a long and healthy life. Lord I pray you make yourself real to them like you did for me in Jesus name. Friend, If you would like to receive Jesus in your heart or rededicate your life to him, then right where you are say this with me with your heart and lips outloud...  Dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart, forgive me of all my sins, wash me and cleanse me, set me free. I believe that Jesus died for me and that he is coming back again for me. Fill me with your Holy Spirit. Jesus make yourself real to me. I accept you today as my Lord and Saviour. I'm born again, all my sins are forgiven, I'm on my way to heaven because Jesus is in my heart!  Friend if you've said that prayer, I pray that from this day forward your life will never be the same. I tell you today that all your sins are forgiven, and always remeber dont run from God but run to him because God Loves You and has a plan for your life!  If you prayed with me, plz type amen! https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=900241527115892&id=100013901589755  God bless!😁  Don't believe???... From crackhouse/drug dealer in Wash DC to Pastor! Depressed to the point of putting a 40 cal to his head, TO  COMPLETELY SET FREE AND DELIVERED BY THE POWER OF GOD! Listen to this POWERFUL salvation testimony! https://youtu.be/hJuU2wNfDhg  People being filled with the Power of the Holy Spirit At Outreach Event: https://youtu.be/MKWzHeDNpqI In the streets: https://youtu.be/GWqbf7Qv7Kg  Life After Death https://youtu.be/JYuY7Cm4KuQ https://youtu.be/GMAKSByShGU

You know, I guess words don't even matter You know we movin' forward Went to jail came home, time passed, went back again All the pain I felt inside myself, thought it would never end I just thought I would blame myself, can't even blame my friends I was criticizin' myself like, you ain't never gon' win  [Chorus] Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like, "Kentrell, you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it" I'm like, "DeSean, thuggin', you just hustlin' backwards Nigga, you done won I just fail to accept that you not good for anyone" Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh I can feel it in my soul  [Verse 1] They say that he ain't gon' be here long I see myself on top the mountain I'm smokin' strong, I'm keepin' strong No more ridin' with that window down Hangin' out, tryna lay them down My soul, I still ain't think I found When I tell bro on the phone I ain't even been worried 'bout no jewelry now So my girl don't want her a bust down I ain't even been worried 'bout the jury now I been wanna do right since I touched down I been watchin' the way I influence now I ain't post not a picture, I moved on I'm responsible to all these children now Even though they label me tough 'lone Back into my normal home Back inside my closet, puttin' that VLONE on Daughter born, I had to listen while sittin' on the phone First time got her in my arms like, "I can't leave you alone" With all these thoughts on top my dome

You done enough for you an us all, go be you man. Always be a legend. Stay up. Raise them kids. Do good.
We are all born with a sinful nature. To live eternally in paradise and escape eternal torment in hell, we must accept the sacrifice that Jesus made on the cross.  Even though Jesus is God, He came to earth to be a sacrifice for us so that we could live with Him, God the Father and God the Holy Spirit forever. We can't save ourselves by doing good works. Only faith in what Jesus did will save us. Just by believing, we are saved eternally. It can't be lost no matter what. After that, we trust God to do good works in us. It's all about what Jesus did, not what we do.  ...if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.                                                Romans 10:9

Dang the goat back
One day nba young boy skipped two days of school and now we have Saturday and Sunday
Nigga said “who am I who is I “ he might be a clone 😂
It a emotional deep track But wish these Luciferian artist who sold their soul would spit out more conscious lyrics about the world and not about them narcissistic selfs all the time. So boring..we heard about depression enough now about all the drug addicted Rappers. Is over rated..spits out lyrics to wake up the youth so that the youth gets educated...👊🏿👊🏻
literally this song is just heaven

Bruh. He pulling an X and that’s why they always censor him! This man is going to die fr. Birdman knows how big this man is. People who are bad influences to youth and then change are not profitable. Fuck man. R.I.P.
We got the best talent in Louisiana imma just stamp Baton Rouge we that thanks to the ones who made the way 💯❤️
Yeah this is when the young man realized that he was a star…truly…the cognitive dissonance can be overwhelming…that’s reflected in this song…the latter is him overcoming that, accepting it, and showing that he is still  just as hungry as he was day one
#1? Wait till they hear this new Tory Lanez

This is true talent
IMPORTANT MESSAGE :D  the only way to Heaven 1) ADMIT THAT YOU’RE A SINNER: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God." (Romans 3:23) No one is good enough to go to Heaven on his own merit. No matter how much good we do, we still come short.  2) REALIZE THE PENALTY FOR SIN: "For the wages of sin is death..." (Romans 3:23) The penalty for our sin is eternal death in a place called Hell. But there is good news, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to die on the cross for our sins, that whoever believes in Jesus should not perish but have everlasting life. ( see John 3:16) 3) BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED, AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD: 4) CALL UPON THE NAME OF JESUS: Trust in Jesus alone as your Savior. Jesus loves you and He's waiting for you with his arms wide open. Accept Jesus and repent (which means to confess and forsake your sins)
If y'all like this one go listen to that Arms Open off that From the Bayou album that shit 🔥 too

Dang we see this repetitive art in so many artists now dayz it seems all the same   The only thing different about nba yb is his name   no different what pac tried to do or xxxtencion   With the wanting sympathy card for view$   this my friends is what you call the messiah complex   They not telling us the truth   nba yb working as an agenda pusha like the rest of these so called artist   rihanna did the samething sade did   so nba yb is gonna be listed like lil wayne and pac for generations to come as known as the " g.o.a.t." but truly inside his own mind soul and heart he knows that he is " souled out " to the elites a regular puppet to get more and more young souls to his master satan fir the exchange of his very soul .  mac makeup and everything
He always going be #1 no mater what best rapper to ever do it 💯🖤

Don’t go to hell. God loves you and that’s why he sent his son Jesus to die a criminal’s death for you. He accepted humiliation and death so that wouldn’t have to die for your sins. All you have to do is accept him today! Don’t let the devil win family. Accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior today  I love you and more importantly Jesus loves you,  Goodnight.

I fucks with NBA but the music he put out doesn't sound like he grew-up. It sounds more like he knows now he's changed he knows all the bs he did over his career is going to come back to him. He literally got back RIGHT back on the bs music to show he's not scared to die. Bro know its coming.

first song is one of my favorite songs I ever heard. its amazing what rap has turned into. there is almost no limits. youngboy only spoke about his own life, but it still spoke to me. the words, the way the melodies layered with the song, the way it was delivered. it felt like it just poured out of him so naturally. I cant relate to all the details. but I can relate to all the overall feelings. This was instantly one of my all time favorite songs. it's so real.
Can someone write the lyrics down? Please
I love the emotional songs he has but love the energy he brings with songs like alligator walk slimeee
Yeah!!
Im him...love you guys.we da real deal..we did it...
I love you YB💚💚💚💚💚🐍🐍🐍🐍

The top 10  Funniest One Liners ever  1. Ask me about my vow of silence. 2. The hardness of butter is directly proportional to the softness of the bread. 3. The last thing on earth you want to do will be the last thing you do. 4. I've only been wrong once, and that's when I thought I was wrong.  5. Atheism is a non-prophet organization. 6. Despite the cost of living, have you noticed how it remains so popular? 7. Save the whales. Collect the whole set. 8. It's been Monday all week. 9. Gravity always gets me down. 10. This statement is false.  Editorial: Perhaps the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit.  Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die.  This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true:  Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said,  "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery  already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said  "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying,  thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten  Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or  guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not  God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son  to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that,  while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the  dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who  confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do  that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a  wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God  will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

Not gonna lie I really think that time sitting down made youngboy even more dangerous in the rap game. It gave him time to reflect on his craft and his family and now I think he is motivated even more to show that he is not the monster the feds potray him to be and that he is the best father to his kids 💯💯💯. Welcome back NBA keep grinding 🔥🔥

https://youtu.be/gyKjKqH5GJo go listen to that🔥🔥🔥🔥
Facts I missed Yb 😤😎
Yb number one for trending music  the best rapper and my favorite rapper
Almost 8 million views in 4 days! Beautiful song, this reminds of the Beatles coming up. People not listening to the message and just blaming him for an entire genre and industries apathy mixed with bad parents and their unwillingless to hold accountability. The quote evil flourishes when good men do nothing was a reference to apathy not any action and Youngboy has always showcased raw reality and human emotions which everyone can relate to. You have the talent and star power to become larger than the Beatles man, and the grind to do it! Prayers for minimal distractions that lfie throws at us to come your may man, and for you to reach your true potential as well!
Yb the real 🐐 couldn't wait for him to be free 💯 🙏
#respect
2pac is alive
The best of the best
👑

I’m still trying to see what’s good about this music! IMO, IT’S TRASH @ BEST!!!!
greatest to ever do it
Yb 💚 🐐
nice song
We are to protect this man as if he is the president of the United States of America. #LOVEYOUNBA
The best rapper in the world
This man is a legend. There's only one lil Wayne and youngboy could never be like him but at the same time there's only one youngboy and no one could do what he does or ever be like him. This man does what every artist wish they could without a label or help and on top of that he don't even care. He's just naturally gifted. God blessed him foreal. This man in my opinion is the greatest
Dis song have a nigga in his feelings den  Str8 murder bidness

When YB flows like how he does on Heart & Soul, I get reminded of his talent. He really do this rap shit. Fuck the haters. Fuck the media.

Why did you delete all your music
I love it 😍
I can now see why ppl fuck with him heavy going thru his music and here something like heart and soul shows the real growth in him and how he is tired of the system and how he is presented towards the world as a monster instead of a person (im high asf) but it's really hard to actually hate him frfr
Keep pushing up we almost out this place man out of the 4 ligaments of our prison (body) flesh you know what I mean
He's growing up...Time sober gives his mind clarity and if he stays in this zone watch how everything changes

Romans 10:9 If you declare with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.  Romans 10:13 for, "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."  John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  John 3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.

He Look to Stretch out without no witness round💯💥💥
Heart & soul is a hit
Yb better
He matured bare this time 💯
englishyo
I feel bad for my yb
This double video is kinda interesting. I see it as he wants to just drop music that comes from his heart like the first part of the video, & like 38 baby 2 album. But his image (label) doesn’t want him to shine so they make him drop aggressive songs that don’t make the radio to try & keep him down & keep him from showing his true self & being a super star even tho he’s one in many peoples eyes
"when my OGs say a nigga ever cross me" stg bro...
this shit hard how he switched the flow
YB better 🐐
Valid bro respect NBA youngboy🙏
🐐
Just when y'all thought he couldn't get any better 🙄 not everybody 💯

My hero💯
There is freedom in the person of Jesus Christ. He will set you free from the chains that this world has bound you with. He came in the likeness of sinful flesh in order to be the one who would conquer death and take on the sin of the world. He allows those who come to follow him a way to not only eternal life but also to a relationship with God him self. He is the only way to eternity. He said “I am the way, the truth, and the life and no one comes to the father except through me.” We cannot earn our way to heaven by being a good person. We cannot add anything to the route that Christ has given us. “You are saved by grace through faith, this is not of your selves, this is a gift of God. Not of works so that no one may boast.” He loves you so much that he was willing to die for you even though you don’t yet believe in him. He will take from you the burdens set on you by the world and give you life, true life. Cry out to Christ for the salvation of your soul. Repent of your sins. He will save you and He will seal you with the Holy Spirit. You are an image bearer of the one true living God. You mean something and are loved more than you will ever know.
Soul, role, toll, scroll, mole
I’m praying  for u lil top

🔥🔥🔥
the problem with the new music nowadays is artist made enough money to start their own label and now they're hiring other people and signing them and they don't know what they're doing they should have just stuck to doing what they were doing just making their stupid songs and music instead they go oh you know what I've got an ear for talent I believe I do let me go ahead and start my own label and sign all these people with no talent and then there's a whole bunch of people out there that keep buying the garbage because they don't have any real taste in music they don't know what real music sounds like or real lyrics or real voices it's so sad with the music industry has turned into they just literally sign anybody nowadays and almost 80% of them suck dick!
COVID 19 IS ALL KNOWN, AND ALL PLANNED FOR ECONOMIC RESET.  THIS IS BIBLE PROPHECY IN THE MAKING

Other rappers may be the goat, but this men is above that sh**t.
Why this song ain't on Spotify
Finale he out of jail if he got good music then like on this comment in subscribe to him like to him
Youngboy Never Broke Again
oh na wat is he smokin this not rap
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😎😎😎😎
This men is something else. Is not doing too much just for the clout like most of them in this industry. He’s himself in every song and he release music according to his emotions of the moment. He’s not always talking bout jewelry and h**es just for getting stream and fame.Matter of fact the way he release music allows us to relate and feel less alone. He really puts his emotions on a plate for us. Other rappers claim to be the goat but I’ll say Kentrell has surpassed that sh**t
This why I fw yb frl‼️💯
Love you boi keep yoo head up out hear nigga

He wants a relationship with you!! Follow Christ and stop following this world ! HELL IS NO PLACE FOR MAN!! Don’t give up keep pushing and stay close to God!
Can’t believe this man moved to Utah. He really tryna evolve and move on in life man big respect

Heart and Soul is a fantastic song and honestly brought tears to my eyes, In honor of my support of NBA YoungBoy and  his work I made a cover of Love is Poison   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVP6vSBX544                                                                                     I feel that his lyrics and voice is accessing a collective chord for so many listeners because he is so authentic and sings/raps about his true feelings and what hes going through which most of his listeners including myself can connect with and relate to.   Nothing is contrived or cliche in his work and he makes himself totally vulnerable. He is the consummate "artist"!
dont stop.💔😔
Yes I love it you can see the growth an maturity💪💪💪💯💯💯 #LookAtThatBoyGo 😢🙏🙏🙏
God know I’m trying
He was standing on the demon tho 😭😭
Im crying ?

LETS TOUCH THESE YOUNGSTAS🙏🗣#mamaintraiseno
NBA YB splitting faxxxxx
Never dare God !!!! I repeat The Titanic boat ⛵️ owner said: not even God can sink this boat ′′ and you know what happened?" The boat ⛵ sank immediately  Marilyn Monroe said: I don't need JESUS, 3 days later she was found dead.  A mother said to her daughter, God be with you. Ironically she replied, ′′ in the trunk. by That she meant here doesn't fit ′′ on the trip there was an accident where all the young people who went died and the trunk stayed intact... Dad told his Son, may God protect you, and the son said my friends will protect me more than God, when He was returning from his work a stray bullet killed him.. where the friends could not protect him...  A boy went to a church started peeing on the cross saying there is no GOD the next day he lost his arms, and confess  A man got this message and deleted it saying what!! God doesn’t exist, the man suffers for 8 years, another man Got this message and share it to many people as possible he was promoted in his Job.  GOD opens doors that no one can close through this message. And if you don't need GOD ignore this message and don't spread it...  This message aims to turn around the world, the president of Argentina received it and ignored and at 8 days his son died.  This message is sacred and miraculous.   Share this message to 5 different Facebook groups And type Amen in 5 days you will receive a surprise. Don't ignore !!! A blessing will comes to you in the form of a house, marriage or financially. Don't break it or ask questions, this is a test. Is GOD the first in your life? If so, leave what you're doing and write amen and share in 5 different Facebook groups for this miracle.
Welcome back legend 🔥🔥

When did young boy start singin
Ecclesiasticus 3:11-16 For the glory of a man is from the honour of his father; and a mother in dishonour is a reproach to the children. My son, help thy father in his age, and grieve him not as long as he liveth. And if his understanding fail, have patience with him; and despise him not when thou art in thy full strength. For the relieving of thy father shall not be forgotten: and instead of sins it shall be added to build thee up. In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembered; thy sins also shall melt away, as the ice in the fair warm weather. He that forsaketh his father is as a blasphemer; and he that angereth his mother is cursed: of God.
HEART & SOUL Intro] (Went to jail came home) Jason! Man say, I-I feel good nigga And it's- you know, my first time bein' on the mic, nigga (Went to jail came home) Who am I? Like, who was I?

You can knock ‘‘em But you can’t Stop him 🙏🏾
He good but idk why y’all keep giving these rappers GOAT status. He isn’t the GOAT. But he will if he keeps going. If you say he the GOAT over someone like Eminem or Lil Wayne right now your smoking K2. End of the day it’s geneocide music and you can’t say he’s talking anything real deep like a Tommy McDonald, or whatver. His beat selection is good and he has a good flow, but he’s no different then king Von, or spot em gotem. Drugs and killin. Just in a way yall like it but it’s no different then nardo wick or these rappers selling death. Some of y’all wouldn’t know real if it slapped you in the face.
Growing Into the king you are
He the only one i listen to no cap
Love you youngboy
Stand up daddy you got this bay u got that shi out the mud

Ok YoungBoy just gave me chills I felt this 🔥🔥🔥🔥👌💯😳
👂⏰🗣️Mathew 4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. Luke 3:7 Then he said to the multitudes that came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Luke 3:8 Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to  say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones. Flee eternal hell🔥, cry out to God to save you, because Jesus Christ died and is now risen at the right hand of God and he makes intercession. Only in him my Lord Jesus Christ is salvation found.  Rom10:9 👂 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🙏🏼. Jesus Christ is God in the flesh. Came  to destroy the works of the devil.  Plea and call out to God to save you from your sins. Please plea with him. He saved me from all my sins and forgave me. I have eternal life only because he died and now is risen at the right hand of God and he ever lives to make intercession for us.⏰🥰😊🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼⏰⏰⏰👐🕯️🙏🏼🥺  I love this Channel. I had to share the Gospel with you guys. I love you all. I hope that you may all come to saving faith in Jesus Christ 🙏🏼❤️🙏🏼🙏🏼

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him! "Go and sin no more."-Jesus

Hardest 🔥🔥

YB better
🐊🐊🐊🐊
Goat💚💚💚
I love You YoungBoy
🐐
I like your hair it’s crazy
for the people who say yb just wines and cries on the mic now not every song about killing and gang shit this man pours his heart and soul and pain into his music to express himself and he don’t care what people think bout it and it takes real courage for a man now a days to talk about his mental health especially to millions of people. he maturing and moving on to better things in life. rap should not always be bout murder and killing and drugs and hoes. he know his real fans rockin with him no matter what kind of music he put out💯💯you just got to listen and understand his lyrics. he got heart and tryna turn his life around, and it’s even harder cuz he had to get off all them drugs he was on for so long. forever supportive of this man he came a long way from where he was years back you can’t deny that.
Yb🔥🔥
My boy
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 my boy is back!!! Sound grown and mature
Dislike

This new clone sucks and took down his videos 😂
Damn he so beautiful
and somehow he is STILLL musically growing, anyone else would've fell off by now
He’s just a goat
This yb clone making better music then the real one, thank god. 🔥
He said Beaumont that’s where I’m from 😭❤️
Nigga went from 😞😭to 👿🔪
Before I got saved I use to listen to a lot of Kentrell’s music. I don’t listen to him any more, but I heard he had just got out of jail and this popped up in my recommendations of course. I like the fact he’s looking at how he influence the young men out here. He literally wants to be a better person, but Youngboy one thing I can say is making better choices comes with sacrifices, I know this from experience, God bless you and your little ones. Talk to God repent and be baptized, it’s all worth it in the end, no matter what anybody tells you.   The crazy thing is, even though I got saved and stopped listening to secular music, I always thought about youngboy, and it wasn’t because of the music it was because of discernment, I realized he had something much deeper going on with himself that was beyond music. And I could tell by his lyrics. He is extremely intelligent and knows God.

Drake just take a seat next to the Goat you call him big bruh if you want a feature

I'm writing this letter, send it own, while a nigga locked down ...having thoughts of being home...they got me isolated in this one man cell, look at me going crazy in this one man hell...my minds blown 🤯..plus in another day another week is gone...I close my eyes and pray to god...he tells me stay strong✊🏾.. A thug crys... tears drop down my black chest drys, a exit out the the game is what I visualize...through blind eyes...I turn in circles though to no escape..jail or hail is my destiny...I know my fait..I told some inmates I'm a changed man..but I ain't changed naan...soon as I touch down  ...I know ima be slanging...but that's the devil speaking...I know its strange...but I feel pain when I see a nigga leaving...wish it was me . Why do I cry when these lights gone... I'm in my cell , going crazy when I think of home...I think of home!...      Bars.. . Come get me!

You know, I guess words don't even matter You know we movin' forward Went to jail came home, time passed went back again All the pain I felt inside myself, thought it would never end I just thought I would blame myself, can't even blame my friends I was critizin' myself like, you ain't never gone' win  [Chorus] Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like Kentrell you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it I'm like DeSean, thuggin you just hustlin' backwards Nigga you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone (Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh) I can feel it in my soul  [Verse 1] They say that he ain't gon' be here long I see myself on top the mountain I'm smoking strong, I'm keeping strong No more ridin' with that window down Hangin' out tryna lay them down My soul, I still ain't think I found When I tell bro on the phone I ain't even been worried 'bout no jewelry now So my girl don't want her a bust down I ain't even been worried 'bout the jury now I been wanna do right since I touched down I been watchin' the way I influence now I ain't post not a picture, I moved on I'm responsible to all these children now Even though they label me tough 'lone Back into my normal home Back inside my closet puttin' that Vlone on Daughter born, I had to listen while sittin' on the phone First time got her in my arms like, I can't leave you alone With all these thoughts on top my dome Chorus] Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like Kentrell you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it I'm like DeSean, thuggin you just hustlin' backwards Nigga you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone (Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh) I can feel it in my soul  [Verse 2] I ain't beefin' wit' all these niggas, don't even mention me They gon' kill me if they can No need for dissin', come get rid of me I'm grown now, I'm a man So tell them ain't no time for sympathy I been holdin' all these bands Don't give a fuck bout who not feelin' me Or into me, intimate, not no consistency She ain't into me, yeah Havin' you, you don't know what it meant to me It ain't get to me, nah, every time that you said you ain't shit to me Even though you meant the world to me Goin' straight even though you curvin' me I ain't worried 'bout all that courtesy Heart on top my shoulder now I'ma sleep on top Burberry sheets Can't take no pill but I'm rollin' now Can't drink no lean but I'm focused now Can't smoke no dope but I'm loaded now Can't tote no gun but I'm strapped right now Lil top on top of the map right now Been dead but nigga I'm back right now Keepin' this shit on track right now I don't take no Adderall Pure washing make my feelings dissolve Phone ring I decline that call Where its trouble, I get back with y'all My hair hang on top my eyes it fall Through the rain, I'm seeing through all this fog [Outro] Kentrell, you got to man up, you done had all these kids I'm like Kentrell you got to stand up, it's your time, I see it I'm like DeSean, thuggin you just hustlin' backwards Nigga you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone (Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh) I can feel it in my soul

Sometimes I wonder why I feel really protective of my youngboy because besides drug addiction I don’t really live life the way he does I think it’s cuz we’ve both been through the type of pain that can only be felt if you’ve gone through those wars and battles in your mind drug abuse etc.

The reason why Youngboy is at the top is because he literally can make you feel every emotion there is in his songs, anger, hurt, guilt, shame, sadness, happiness, and other things as well such as violence, lit, etc.

Youngboy really is the best new school rapper man. All these haters and people who criticize him based on his murder music don’t wanna talk about this side of him it’s sad can do nothing but feel sorry for him. I know it ain’t that deep but in 2019 when I heard lonely child I havnt listen to anymore more than him he’s truly going to go down as the greatest of the 2020.
Go hard nba youngboy good song

Psalm 1:1-3 KJV Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

Heart & soul lyrics  Went to jail came home, time pass went back again All the pain I felt inside my soul thought it’ll never end I just thought I’ll blame myself can’t even blame my friends I was criticizing myself like you ain’t never gon win   [Chorus] Kentrell you gotta man up you done had all these kids I’m like kentrell you gotta stand up this your time I see it I’m like Desaun thugging you just hustling backward nigga you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone and oooh oh oh, and oooh oh oh, and oooh oh oh I can feel it in my soul  [Verse 1] They say that he ain’t gon be here long i see myself on top the mountain  I’m smoking strong Im keeping strong No more riding with that window down Hanging out tryna lay them down My soul I still ain’t think I found When I tell bro on the phone I ain’t even been worried bout no jewelry now So my girl the one I buss down I ain’t even been worried bout the jewelry now I been wanting to do right since I touch down I been watching the way I influence now I ain’t post not a picture I moved on I’m responsible to all these children now Even though they label me tough love Back into my normal home back inside my closet putting that vlone on Daughter born I had to listen while sitting on the phone First time got her in my arms like I can’t leave you alone  With all these thoughts on top my dome  [Chorus] Kentrell you gotta man up you done had all these kids I’m like kentrell you gotta stand up this your time I see it I’m like Desaun thugging you just hustling backward nigga you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone and oooh oh oh, and oooh oh oh, and oooh oh oh I can feel it in my soul  [Verse 2] I ain’t beefing with all these niggas don’t even mention me They gon kill me if they can don’t need for dissing come get rid of me Im grown now im a man so tell them ain’t no time for sympathy I been holding all these bands don’t give a fuck bout who not feeling me Or into me, intimate not no consistency She ain’t into me yeah having you, you ain’t know what it meant to me Ain’t get to me nah every time you say that you ain’t shit to me Even though you meant the world to me Going straight even though you curving me Ain’t worried bout all that courtesy heart on top my shoulder now Imma sleep on top Burberry sheets can’t take no pill but I’m rolling now Can’t drink no lean but I’m focus now Can’t smoke no dope but I’m loaded now Can’t Tote no gun but I’m strapped right now Lil top on top on the map right now Been dead but nigga I’m back right now Keeping this shit on track right now I don’t take no adderall pure washer make my feelings dissolve Phone ring I decline that call  Where its trouble i get back with y’all  My hair hang on top my eyes it fall Through the rain I’m seeing through all this fog  [Chorus] Kentrell you gotta man up you done had all these kids I’m like kentrell you gotta stand up this your time I see it I’m like Desaun thugging you just hustling backward nigga you done won I just felt except that you not good for anyone and oooh oh oh, and oooh oh oh, and oooh oh oh I can feel it in my soul  Pls let me know if I got anything wrong so I can correct it🙏🏾  Alligator walk lyrics    [Chorus] Imma get em stepped on Who them dead bodies for my nigga  They been stepped on  Doing em dirty do em bad Imma get you repped on Got a shirt tied around his head just for a mask and got the window down Keep yo heat be cool imma get all of em gone   [Verse 1] I stopped the whip hopped in the street  Right inside my pants where I tote the heat Dead bodies left right where I be Green flag nigga know it ain’t no peace  Meechy still selling dope from belmont way back in missouri street  Top tryna split a nigga from p street way back to south 13 Bitch my money up and I’m booting up in a Lexus like it’s 99 Bitch I’m chewed up and I’m tooled up and I’m flexing you is not my kind Rich just got that Maybach truck Jump in that bitch light up time My empire been holding up but now they need to free them slimes Them ones who going to spit my rhymes  Owe ones who down deserve my time  Get loaded while I think bout youngin  Need to win one million a million times  50 ar hold 60 got it with me in the city sliding Ptr on press the grip and hit it taking off your mind  [Chorus] Imma get em stepped on Who them dead bodies for my nigga  They been stepped on  Doing em dirty do em bad Imma get you repped on Got a shirt tied around his head just for a mask and got the window down Keep yo heat be cool imma get all of em gone   [Verse 2] This that fuck a hater talk bitch Realest from the bayou this that alligator walk bitch Real assassination shit he gon put a wig on while he slang that stick Real food distributor still drive navigators around this bitch Bang this rollie I got blessed with way from 96 Get a drop imma drop one talking about lil top you know ai I keep a hot gun Loaded I been rolling plus I’m mugged up cause it’s not fun Been in this bitch and doing my shit since they saying he was too young and this bitch acting like you wanna do something  Youngest flexing whoop em zip em drag em out Stolo whipping pistol gripping tryna bag em down He left two stretched out without no witness around Still had army in that north when I ain’t millions round   [Chorus] Imma get em stepped on Who them dead bodies for my nigga  They been stepped on  Doing em dirty do em bad Imma get you repped on Got a shirt tied around his head just for a mask and got the window down Keep yo heat be cool imma get all of em gone  This took a while but it’s worth it👍🏾🔥

Youngboy most likely is living in Utah. Based off of the architecture of his garage alone. This is also based upon his backgrounds in his backyard. Specifically the greater Utah area.

The reason why Youngboy is at the top is because he literally can make you feel every emotion there is in his songs, anger, hurt, guilt, shame, sadness, happiness, and other things such as violence, lit, etc.

Yb fdw
Yb man 🥺 too happy to see bruh
from most hated to most loved 🐐
This dude is the realest there is. You can feel he means everything he saying and has reasoning for everything he believes in. People honestly don’t realize how intelligent he truly is. He makes more music than anybody else could ever dream of, and I’m talking good music. And he does it just because he can 😂. And for that reason I literally don’t listen to anyone but him. Unless I play his bro Bway Yungy sometimes I have to check the song, cause he sounds exactly like YoungBoy at times.
i feel this man onna diff level 😞
The 🐐 dropped ❗️❗️❗️
Here within an hour gang!!!!
Master
Goat

Nba on top here every time he drop let’s turn up max volume 😮‍💨
Youngboy has gotten me through so much i sit back an think a guy who came from nothing just like me who loves music just like me can help me out of a deep sadness an for that i thank you osrs your a legend I really appreciate what you do for people you have helped so many people by doing what you love
I needed this.

Let's go youngboy ❤❤🖤🖤🖤 hope you see this
man never disappoints , love you 💚🐐
Heart and soul is such a beautiful song thank you kentrell, your ability to grow and mature into a man and come to the realization that with responsibilities comes pressure. And your ability to handle that pressure and be calm and collected even during tough times and overcome adversity and continue to develop just shows the person ur becoming.   As for alligator walk I know ur having fun and dancing and talk about situations that you’ve been thru. However glorifying killing and murder, doesn’t have to be the example we set for our youth. As the greatest rapper and a role model to other rappers. Just be wise on the words and influence you have. All love kentrell ✅ u my fav rapper.
💚

Lyrics Heart & Soul :  Went to jail came home, Who am I Aye, Who is I I guess words dont even matter You know we movin' forward  Went to jail came home, time passed went back again All the pain I felt inside myself, thought it would never end I just thought I would blame myself, can't even blame my friends I was critizin' myself like, You ain't never gone' win Kentrell you gotta man up, you done had all these kids Im like Kentrell you gotta stand up, Its your time, I see it Im like Desaun, thuggin you just hustlin backwards, nigga you done won I just felt accept that you not good for anyone (Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh,) I can feel it in my soul  They say that he ain't gon' be here long I see myself on top the mountian Im smoking strong Im keeping strong No more ridin' with that window down Hangin out tryna lay them down My soul, I still ain't think I found When I tell bro on the phone I ain't even worried bout no jewelry now So my girl dont want her a bussed down I ain't even worried bout no jewelry now I been tryna do right since I touched down I been wathcin' the way I influence now I ain't post not a picture, I moved on Im responsible to all these children now Even though they label me tough love Back into my normal home Back inside my closet puttin' that Vlone on Daughter born I had to listen while sittin' on the phone First time got her in my arms like, I can't leave you alone With all these thoughts on top my dome Kentrell you gotta man up, you done had all these kids Im like Kentrell you gotta stand up, Its your time, I see it Im like Desaun, thuggin you just hustlin backwards, nigga you done won I just felt accept that you not good for anyone (Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh,) I can feel it in my soul  I ain't beefin' wit all these niggas, dont even mention me They gon' kill me if they can No need for dissin', come get rid of me Im grown now, I'm a man So tell them ain't no time for sympathy I been holdin' all these bands, dont give a fuck bout who not feelin me Or into me, intimate, not no consistency She ain't into me, havin' you, you ain't know what it meant to me It ain't get to me, naw, every time that you said you ain't shit to me Even though you meant the world to me Goin' straight even though you curvin' me I ain't worried 'bout all that courtesy Heart on top my shoulder now Imma sleep on top Burberry sheets Can't take no pill but im rollin' na Can't drink no lean but im focused na Can't smoke no dope but im loaded na Can't tote no gun but im strapped right na Lil top on top of the map right na Been dead but nigga im back right na Keepin this shit on track right na I dont take no adderal, [?] make my feelings dissolve Phone ring I decline that call Where its trouble, I get back with yall My hair hang on top my eyes it fall Through the rain, gon' see through all this fog Kentrell you gotta man up, you done had all these kids Im like Kentrell you gotta stand up, Its your time, I see it Im like Desaun, thuggin you just hustlin backwards, nigga you done won I just felt accept that you not good for anyone (Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh, Oooh, oh oh,) I can feel it in my soul

💚💚💚💚 slimelife
Gotta follow some guidelines
Top🐍🔥🔥
If there's one state that I would want to have house arrest in, it's Salt Lake City Utah. No Cap!!  Utah is God's playground. 1) He can stay away from the street lifestyle! 2) Beautiful state that I hope youngboy doesn't take for granted. Learn to ski, snowboard, shred fuck out of some snowmobiles! 3) find some sexy snow bunnies  Travel 3 hours south and explore Southern Utah. It is like you're exploring the Grand Canyon. Unbelievably beautiful state!

This has got to be one of his most inspirational positive songs I've ever heard. Looks like we're seeing him literally change before our eyes and I'm liking what I'm seeing.

Hold up I commented too soon! This man just came out with a banger half of the video Midway through.. That's that Gangsta shit now this man is too versatile

Praising my father Kentrell DeSean Gaulden is not a lifestyle, it’s a born talent given to me from Mr. Gaulden himself. You wake up in the morning giving thanks to him for allowing you to see another day, you give thanks to him at night before bed for protecting you throughout the day. I am very honored for what we’ve accomplished as a family. Peace will not be a thing until my Lord and Savior Kentrell is free. In the name of Youngboy Amen 🙏🏾💚..
LOVE YOU YOUNGBOY!!!!!!!

Youngboy really changed me

Yb is the definition of dont judge a book by its cover. The image he has and the music he makes are polar opposites its impressive 🔥
Kentrell has turned into a man, if anyone disagrees then you’ve got too much hate in your soul. Yb, that’s the goat of this rap game and the voice of the youth. He’s been my voice for 4 years, going onto 5 and then 6 and then infinite years. Love this man, MAN, with my whole heart. Not only a mentor to me and millions, but he’s also a great guy if you get to see the bright side of Him   Edit: nothing nor nobody can change my mind. I fuck with YB heavy and I’d literally choose to listen to YB rather than anyone else besides my parents in general-wise. Music wise, nobody can grab my attention like YB. Nobody will make me feel as excited as I do with every YB upload. It feels like Christmas when he uploads a song. That’s true love for an artist, a human. Call me a fanboy, cause I am. I’m a huge fan of YB and I’ll admit it until the day I die with no shame or regret. Whether he’s locked up or not
I fucking love you kentrell
