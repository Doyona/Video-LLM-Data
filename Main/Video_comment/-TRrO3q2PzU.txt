I can’t believe this is still up when it didn’t happen
Watched plenty of Brendan’s fights.. been watching ufc for years.. and this brings a whole new level of respect for bro..
Don’t want to repeat the story??? That’s how you get a good bit. He should be repeating this story over and over
Brendan was driving drunk and helped out in an accident. Luckily he never got into an accident as a result from his drunk driving and had to issue a statement his beast of lawlyers wrote up for him to cover his ass like they did here with what to say.
🤥
No, I still do not respect him.
More men like Shaub
I just heard of this! Good on you Brendan! You’re a good soul
unfortunately schaub is lying here. very shameful, I feel he should get his brain scanned. this has to be cte
I just can’t shit on Schaub anymore after this.
true?
Side note: it’s so hard to hear someone say “gas” is pouring out of a diesel. Diesels don’t run on gas, Bubba
I8 wheelers use desiel, not gas. , Sounds like Cheech and Chong. " I ran up two or three steps, burning baby all over me,"
This guy is a moron to the max but rhuuuge respect for this you are a true hero for this just shows we are all capable of beauty in this world
and yall believe all this shit he say ? watch the news about the accident they were pulling the kids and you cant see a brendan there saving kids lives
Gay af
Now this is a good human
He might be a meat head but he have his heart in the right place.
This story isn’t complete un true, but it’s mostly untrue.
I’ve had the unfortunate experience of going up to a car that friends of mine where in when we where involved in an accident. I was in another vehicle. It is very scary. The love in your heart to save people does come out without you thinking about it and Brandon was a hero.
real hero
I've always liked brendan and could never understand all the hate he cops, he's literally a hero and very successful in his own right. Thank God for this man, such q traumatic story so sorry to the kids who lost their mum rip
To be honest its a shame the father didnt die
Reading some of the comments on this video actually might give me brain damage how can you hate on this dude whos pouring his story out? Go hate on one of his podcast episodes you losers
X to doubt
I don't know who Rick...
Thank god brendan was there
"What..in...the fuck...is goin onman."  Even when Brendan's being a hero he's imitating Joe Rogan.
I’m a real EMT FIREFIGHTER been one for 12 years I don’t do it for likes you guys clearly posted this for like it’s ridiculous you should just do it whether people know or not this is ridiculous
Jesus dude
This made me tear up man… I respect Brendan so much for this
Man bro, I’m a guy that doesn’t cry often at all. I’m very cynical, to my own detriment. Man I’m sitting crying like a baby without a bottle. That poor young woman just loved the wrong man. And those pups, man. I just 🙏 lord ol mighty give those pups the peace they deserve.
He leaves after being the main witness cuz he wanted the date night
Thank you Brendan
Respect Brendon .
People are some hatters! Brendan is a great guy, and he’s funny.
Man is a straight up legend
People really need to quit hating on this Man. He deserves all the respect. He wasn't the best UFC Fighter but he was a UFC fighter and beat CroCop. He isn't the best comedian but he is getting better.  He is legit a Good Man which is rare in Famous people.
Considering the fact that Brendan is a pathological liar, I doubt this is how it happened. That said, kudos to Brendan for trying to help in any way he could.  I still hate this dumbass, but a good deed is a good deed and Brenda deserves praise for that.
God bless your heart and may your kids be blessed for it to with a good life. Which I know will happen because they have you.
I fucking lost it when he said “Babe that’s a fucking kid”
God bless you Schaub
Bro made me cry LOL For Real
You can hear the pain in Brendans voice just recalling it, imagine what the kids are going through having to know there father did this on purpose, but gotta give it to Brendan what a hero fr
Love you Brendan. U rip.
This is just horrible all around. I can’t believe a funeral is 30 grand in California. It’s less than 1/3 of that in my area. Even if you want to go all out. You can have a monument for 30k. Price gouging at its finest. Everything plays off emotions nowadays.
Proper good man #Brendanshaub,legand!superman🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅🏅
Props...mad props. Unfortunately I've been on scene with 2 accidents that have fucked me up. Like Brendan said, you see shit in movies, but you see cerebral fluid comin out, brain, people who are still alive, but screaming in pain. Shits fucked up. I have dreams very frequently about them. Been years and it still gets me. I've seen dead bodies, other terrible shit, but being the first on scene for something like this is something else. Some people are cut out for it and rescue or try to rescue lives, I'm not it. Too mentally fucked up lol
I really felt it when he said he was so proud of the younger kid. That one will grow to be a giant among men.
You're such a good man. Brendan God bless you.
Much love bro 💪🏼
Bashed Schaub in the past for sure for his sports takes and comedy but the dudes an undeniably incredible person, hope I’d have the same guts in that situation.
Despite of what people think of Brendan .. he is a good man.
Chief Wahoo hat fire 🔥
Ok this is fucking heartbreaking.
Yes, Brendan Shaub is a decent human being...and Yes, he still sucks at stand up.
Brendan, I don't know if you're reading this but I don't always laugh at your comedy, however your courageous and selfless act of heroism just made me weep. Bravo to you. As an atheist, I'm hoping someone can say a prayer on my behalf for those four little boys
And they got the money for the funeral he single handedly changed this families life
So much respect for this hero! who knows what could have happened in the minutes it would take the police to get there. amazing story and you’re a real life hero!!
This was something meant to happen to him to show him to stop being a pos dad himself
Wow I always thought Brendan was an annoying PoS but wow.  Lol notice how he described the kid as out of shape.
Cant hate on a hero.  Respect.
Those kids are never gonna forget this shit and the words he said
Brendan could introduce them to martial arts training etc. That could help alot too.
I don't wanna hear another person ever talk shit/ make fun of Brendan again. There are few that would've done what he did, and thank God that there are people like him in this world.
Idk what I would’ve done in this situation. Trying to think how scary it would be to be running towards something so dangerous. Brendan is a big man. Bless him.
God bless this man ♥️
God placed you there for that moment. Let Him use you in a magnificent way Branden!!
Hate Brendan most of the time for a variety of reasons. But this was heartbreaking and seeing him cry is such a sad moment
Fu**ing Schaub . Real life hero man, I salute you big guy!! You ARE captain America to these kids and their family!!
Good job Brendan!
Best part of this is that he pronounced the "S" in debris
I've been there. It's really tough, good job. Good man.
Proud of you brother
Brendan has crowns waiting for him in Heaven 🙏. 👍🤜💪.
You are THE man. Balls of steel.
God bless you brenden!  Takes a special person to be able to react in a situation like that.  Not trying to belittle ur situation at all....but this gives ur audience a sneak peak at what law enforcement deals with on somewhat of a regular basis.  But ur actions saved those kids lives and they will forever be grateful for ur actions.  God bless you and thank you for ur act of kindness and bravery sir!!
Brendan, I would have not expected anything less from you, you have a good heart.  You might have to be a presence in those kids' life from this point on!  Many Blessing to you and your family.
That's a fuckin real hero right there people. A. Real. Hero.
this story sounds like total bs
I'm the biggest Brendon hater and I give him all the props in the world for what he did.  I will stop hating on him for the rest of 2021.
Damn that's heavy, ure good man.
Brendan I always knew you were a good guy , I’m so glad you were there , your character has been elevated to super hero
I don’t know if you believe in god, but you were probably put in that spot for a reason.
As much as people mess with this guy, after that he gets a lifetime pass from me
SCHAUB- YOU FUCKING HERO YOU. WAY TO GO!! I love you
🙏🏻💪🏻🙏🏻Gods Work!!!
*Captain America:* “So, I break the window—we break some of the window out. It’s already broke. It’s not like I’m Captain America.”
God please bless Brendan and his family.   🙏🏽 Amen
So heartbreaking 🥺🥺
I feel like Schaub just walked into everyone’s worst nightmare what a complete and true person he is to do that, he could’ve driven on making excuses but he most likely saved those kids if not from dying but not seeing stuff they really didn’t need to see
So many holes in this... first hike being this part of the podcast got manscaoed
Mad respect. You and that family will have my continued prayers
What an amazing man 😭
Never heard his version of the story, that's so insane he's a hero man
I wonder if the guy who got ran over truly deserved it, yes he committed a heinous crime however that is what the justice system is for. There seems to be something else missing, how did the car who ran him over even know what was happening? The way Brendan tells it, it seems even the cops didn't care. Isn't that what the Justice system is for? Was the person who ran him over charged with any crime? Did they really get a pass after running this person over? Not defending that pos but there are laws in this country, one of them being not running people over.
That's some real hero shit. Wow... respect for that one.
Isn't there any law against making shit up like this ?
Of course in typical Brenda Slob fashion, he throws his own gf under the bus by saying “she said just keep going” and he plays himself up as a hero lol
That was tragic thank God for Brendan making the decision to help those kids I pray they find a good home. What a terrible story that brought tears to my eyes.
What a hero! Calm and calculated under pressure saves lives...
Oh man, this story had me in tears. I'm so glad that he was there to help that family. It really takes a special person to stop and help someone in a situation like that because its so dangerous and it all happens in a split second, you really have to have a heart and a mind to make a decision like that. Mad respect to Brendan for this selfless act. 💜
Brendan Schaub is a hero.
Are YOU ready when YOUR time comes to HELP A STRANGER?? Establish YOUR RESOLVE TODAY <3
Very touching story. Crazy to think paramedics and stuff have to go through this type of shit daily….
Respect Brendan
Let's go Brandon
Brendan this story brings up some deep PTSD for me my senior year of High school I was a couple cars behind a head to head car wreck. I pulled over and told my mother to stay in the car and I sprinted towards the accident. The man in the van who wasn’t at fault was bleeding from his neck the motor sitting on his lap. I grabbed his hand and told him help was on the way. I slowly felt his life slip away over the next couple minutes as I tried to keep him alert and talking. It looked like A bomb had went off in the middle of the road. Your story brought tears to my eyes. I had to have therapy for that incident for multiple years and every once in a while I still have dreams about it and I hear the scream and I can feel the pain. Reach out if you ever want to talk. It’s changes your life for sure I know it did for me. Your a good man!
How did Brendan manage to make this horrible situation about himself , absolute wanker
That's crazy
Well done. You.
I have never heard of any of these guys or this podcast but I heard about this from tiktok and it's so heartbreaking. Thank you for being a hero to those kids, thank you for saving them. I know just after hearing all these stories about their mother that she is super grateful and thankful for you. God rest her soul, God bless those kids, her family, and you and yours especially for witnessing and going through it all.
So the tractor trailer had gas, not diesel, pouring out everywhere.  He should have really owned the story by claiming the tractor trailer was a new Tesla Trailer and he saved everyone from being electrocuted.
can you guys give me top comment please? i've never had top comment in my life. hey big boy brenny brown shwerb we love you for this. mad respect my man <3
Brendan is a true MAN, y'all.
Thank god man good job
Schaub is actually a good guy
People still hate on this dude.... I fuck with schaub
I don't really like brendan that much  But really hope schaub is OK after dis one.
As a Northeast Ohio native and huge Indians fan since I was a child, Brenda needs to take off that hat
All jokes aside.. I fu%kin admire this guy! I love his heart and passion! YOU ARE A HERO BRENDAN!
Everyone loves to rag on Schuab and for me he was way more funny back when him and Callen would first go on Rogan and I didn’t know much about it him but he’s sensitive dude (unlike Wrinks) and he’s a good dude 💯
Who the f dislikes this? You must be very unhappy with yourself! Respect Schaub.
Dude, say what you want about Schaubs MMA career... he is a legit HERO. The dude literally saved LIVES. I gain more and more respect for him everytime I listen to a story from him
Unbelievable. You’re a great guy Brendan
1st. unhealthy uneducated with power over the powerless kids and mom had some power in his mind because he maybe couldn't handle perception of looks make the man and she was gravity for being a person. I will never forget this story started of pain bravery and dark numb forever placed into a growing darkness. Soon all our brightest moments will be from moon light. No feelings no rage no untiy just goodnight.
I thought Brandon was just a meathead but this is truly amazing and brave. Glad you did something to help.
You’re a hero Brendan. I hope those kids will be ok. And may their mother RIP. 🙏🏽
' So you're a hero now!!?  Just kidding..great on u Schaub. Good man.
This action will never be forgotten, think those kids will watch here this video one day and read the comments... so be respectful and don't make any stupid jokes please.
Shapel with the Tatsu OPM shirt
Something like this happened to me. Its so crazy how our instincts kick in and we do what we have to do. I realized after the experience that I'm meant to be there for others that are in pain or suffering from something tragic or catastrophic. If we weren't there, things would have been a lot different. Props to you for letting everyone know about the fundraiser. It looks like they met their goal and beyond. Over $70k. She was absolutely gorgeous too, so sad...
And Defund the police literally means allocating the funds where they can be more useful especially when the police departments are now doing literal pre-crime and if you think that’s bullshit look it up.
Its funny how people understand how traumatizing it is for cops to see this shit but can’t imagine how traumatizing it is for brown and black people living in the hood to see and deal with horrific shit on a daily basis. The irony is cops and poor communities have that in common but the connection is never made.🤔
🙏 a good deed 🙏
A kid was waving for help, and my girl said " just keep goin "... Way to make your gf look like shit on a huge podcast 👍
I hope brenden gets some help Man you gonna need to talk to someone man
6:17 bryan callen seen some shit
Yeh schaub. You get a pass for that comedy shit but you dont get a past for your friend callen. Reaccess yourself.
So fake. Sounds like a movie script. First at the crash but you left? Sounds fake to me
Well I love Brendan
This is a fake story. None of what he said matches up with the police report or helicopter footage. The guy was never at the scene or saw it peripherally. What a piece of shit.
Respect Brendan, you are a hero in my eyes
I can't believe people are saying he's lying. Smh. People just want to hate you no matter what
If milking off actually funny comedians and personalities wasn't enough, now we got brendan shlob doing it with crash victims
I watched my father as a young kid pull a teenage girl out of a burning car she flipped over into a ditch. Will always have mad respect for him. Your kids will have that same respect for you my man.
Everyone trashes Brendan for this and that, but at the end of the day he is a legitimately good guy for this.
Schaub may not be the best comedian or the funniest or smartest guy but he's definitely got a big heart.
Dude wtf
This is all about brendan. Don't buy this hype shit. Any man would have pulled over and took the kids out and not even mention it . Other then a shout out to the go fund me..
Damn man I got goose bumps hearing this story...
It’s crazy one unexpected moment can mess you up more than cage fighting
God bless you Brendan. That’s crazy. Thank you for helping out those kids. I hope you get some peace soon. I got to see and was first on scene at a car accident a couple years back too and I still remember that day clearly. Still don’t know what happened to the guy that got hit. But the others were a group of drunk drivers. I was a delivery driver for dominos and the guy had just left the store with pizza. I was coming back from a delivery when this happened. 😔
I'm confused why someone would dislike the video, hes sharing something that happend which is very traumatizing had me in tears and I lile to think things don't bug me but damn wish people would openly talk like this more
Respek
If this is a fucking lie like people are claiming, people should pull him up on it
Those kids might be killed, and that dad might be free and do bad stuff again
This is what BRAVE is
Wow! I will Never look at Brendan the same again! He for sure Saved those Kids lives, It takes a Real Man to put yourself in that much Danger to Save a life!!
That’s a horrible story , I’m so angry at that piece of trash  of a father . Karma is real . Brendan you did the right thing much respect
😞😣😭
Love ya mate …. True hero when it counts most ….
Brendan, what a fucking hero
You’re a good man Brendan, I hope you’re ok mate x
How did you see it all, you said the 18 wheeler had already crashed ?
The real issue is the fathers mental health. It’s great to want to take care of the kids, but If you want to see true lasting change, donate to a men’s mental health organization.
Man shit right there
Hell of a full circle if that kid becomes UFC champ and thanks Brendan for saving his family 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
Don't like the guy but what a heroic move, fucking incredible
well shaub has never made me cry before
Prayers for the kids - so heartbreaking
Ive never clowned Brendan, because i knew mans had a soft spot and i just dont feel right doing it but to hear this and what he did, mans really a good example to us, lets be more like Brendan.
Sent my love to that go fund me
LAFD has confirmed he is lying
The fact the dad was hit while trying to run intervene with Brendan saving the kids, probably happened for a reason
Well done brother
Breden been a G fuck all the people who try to down him .
Brendan is a solid dude from my perspective. I'm still gonna clown him, but he is a good dude.
Ahh those poor kids. Well done Brendan, that’s some heavy life changing shit to have to experience. I hope you stay in touch with the family.
Who can think it's not real? You can't fake his controlled emotions.
I know how you feel
Your a legend
That's hero shit bro!
Imagine being one of the 407 people to dislike this video. Couldn’t be me.
Diesel not gasoline  🤪
Those kids will remember what you did for them for the rest of their lives Brendan. You're a fucking hero.
I lost my mother back in 2007. I was in my father's car. He slammed my mom's car twice. My mom's car flipped and she got slung out of her car going 100 mph. I watched her at 11 years old bleed out infront of me. Until the cops showed up. I seen the entire thing. I have PTSD from it. My dad intentionally did it. Only got 16 years in prison. Gets out next year.  I think he did amazing keeping the children from seeing. If I was just there and never seen my mom lifeless on the ground. I wouldn't been nearly as messed up growing up. Incredible person you are.
I'm very impressed by Brian Callen. He's not ever come across as a decent guy to me, but here he showed me I was completely wrong. Very thoughtful and caring comments. Good man. And of course Brendan is a good man for doing what he did and will continue to do for these people.
"If not you then who? If not now then when?.....perfect quote.
God sent, for real. 🌄 Great people do great things simple as that. Simply having that instinct to help another human being despite the fact of the fear of the outcome, only shows that certain humans are truthy benevolent at their core.
When I was taught on how to deal with casualties in the Marine Corps They taught us to never say "someone get the medic!" because everyone thinks that someone else is going to get the medic and no one does. So when Brendan a stranger saw those kids and sprung into action that was honorable, and virtuous. What Brendan did was courageous, and deserves respect. Thank God people like him are in this world. Now it's time for us to help those kids.
Shoutout to Chapel's One-Punch shirt. Also, shoutout to Big Brown for thiccin out and saving these chilren. Respect
Crazy story. Such a shame. Especially the POS dad surviving. Life is so unfair but hopefully the kids are taken care of.
What a traumatic event, good for Brendan. Good karma is coming his way
Become a big brother show them good men.
Hey does Brendan have kids? I'm not sure.
You will always know you did the right thing, I wish I was wealthy enough to truly give money to families in situations like these. Hope you and the kids sty in touch over their lives to see where they are and what they decide to do in life.
Wait is Bryan Callen back finally.
God Bless you, B.
You are a hero, Brendan
All respect to Brendan truly life changer
I didn't wanna cry this early, but here we are. You're a good man, Brendan.
Great story, brave to stop nowadays. 30,000 for a funeral though...Damn
This made me cry. Right place right time. Blessings.
You're an amazing guy Brendan!! even more respect for you!!
God bless you Brendan
I say you lock Schuab in a cell with that pos dad for 15 minutes
He's such a good man. Looking the child in the eyes and telling him that he was strong, that the child made the difference in that moment. That child will remember you and what you did for him for the rest of his life.   You were both badasses that day and will be badasses for life. Much respect to you and yours, Mr. Schaub.
Gofundme link is closed. Is there a new one? Let's get these kids through college.
As much as we make fun of Brendan, this guy is undeniably a fucking HERO.
Your literally his superhero 💛
She’s with Yahawa now, blessings to the children.
Always been a Fan & I don’t understand why people doubted you on this at all. You have helped a ton of people out already. The proof is there, good job man.
Man Brendan is honestly truly a great guy
Tried to donate, but no longer accepting donations :/
What a great man! Much respect Shaub.
Respect
Salute!     American hero
When u ready N update plz
Brendan bro ur a bad ass  father to father ur fucking hero take peace in that an god calls us in time that he u know wht i mean i buried my father two weeks ago whom was a agreat man but chose to live for drugs an alcohol he had his own issues I never not lived hom for who he was i loved him because i did period . Those children need to be put on to training in ur gym rather u know it or not god put u in those kids life an u should do all ucan to remain in contact untill they understandwht happen
Good on ya mate 👍🏻
Its obviously heartbreaking. But 30 large for a funeral seems a little excessive
Fair play to you Brendan, major props to you.
Hero
Holy f*ck
This was a horrible event glad you stopped bro most people would of just drove by
man, one time about a year ago my brother (foster brother) was at my house. he was driving away after we hung out and right as i walk away i hear a loud bang from the direction he left in. i immediately ran out to the street to see what was going on. he got t boned by someone. i took off as fast as i could for the car. so i see he is dazed but i'm panicking and have no idea if he was okay or not. i run to his side where the other car had hit and i jammed my hands in the door. the doors were kinda warped and stuck but somehow i managed to get the door open by prying it. my bro was okay thank god just got knocked around a bit but i ended up breaking my knuckle from jamming my hands in the door. i unbuckled him and had him lay on the side walk on his back until the ambulance came but to this day i don't regret any of it. the other driver was more than fine and called 911 but i've never been put to the fire like that and i havnt since. i'm glad i have some sort of courage and was able to help though. but i really do respect you brendan, i usually have my instincts get me into trouble bc i act and speak before i think. but thank god you were there to help those kids. i wouldn't have been able to do half the stuff you did and have that composure. you made my story look lame but i wanted to share it anyways because i've felt that kind of urgency to help someone and just acted on it. i admire that about you brendan and i'm glad you and those kids were safe, without you who would have pulled over to help man. men like us are just built different, a little stupid but a whole lot of balls. good job bro.
Thank you for helping those kids. You were a hero that day. This is something you will carry with you forever.
Well god damn, Brendan is a hero. He was obviously at the right place and time that day. When he was needed the most, he came through.
This made me cry so hard
I never get why people always bashed Brendan, he's an awesome guy, he deserves a medal!
Never thought Brendan would bring me to tears with a story...well...minus that Netflix special.. ;)
What a legend brendan schaub is
Talm bout heroes B
Brendan. You are an amazing man for doing what you did. Thank you. Badass
Hopefully that trucker gets help as well for being put in that position and will have that in his head for the rest of life.
If he was still fighting he may not have been at the right place at the right time. Good on Brendan for answering the call.
This man became a Hero, never gonna shit talk this guy again
Thank you for stopping and helping. I have a baby and I just can’t imagine him all alone like that. Or ANYONE else’s babies out there, like that, without mom, LIKE THAT. That’s too much too see. FOR ANYONE of ANY AGE. I really hope you’re okay or that you will be okay later, B. That’s rough. Don’t be afraid to reach out for help from a professional!
He's always there for people
18 wheeler has diesel
I've come a crossed more scene like this then I would like and I can confirm REAL trauma to the human body is WAY different in real life. The movie version is incredibly tame in comparison. There are a few things he did wrong but acting quickly is crucial in certain situations.
That’s horrible that the husband did that. What a POS
Bless you for stopping to help, thats what humanity is all about
GOD BLESS YOU BRENDAN....youre a hero my man
I wanted to give money but unfortunately they closed their Gofundme.
Wow man… such a tragedy, hope the kids will be ok and big props to Brendan for handling that beautifully
guy is a hero
Damn dude.   I had no idea you were such a genuinely good guy / hero types.  I mean you seem like a nice guy for sure but.. wow. +900000 respect from me man.
Brendan plz stop
I never cared much for Brendan before hearing this story; major respect for stepping up & helping out.
I don’t know you or much about you but I respect you .
What a guy mad respect to him
Bless your soul ❤
Heavy. I was going north and live in Encino off Hayvenhurst, and passed the accident. I couldn’t figure out how it happened, not knowing it was a wrong way driver. The guy actually took the Haskell off ramp on to the 101 South going North. Sad.
Schaub your a saint man . True saint . Those kids will never forget you . God bless .
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Thank you Mr Shaub
I was not expecting this at all and am fighting back tears. What an incredible thing to save those children, to let them live their lives!
Brendan might be a goofy fuck, but he's a good guy👌🏼
You’re a total hero Brendan!
The GFM was capped at 70k and I can no longer donate
The fact that reddit is trying to call him a liar is just insane
Aren't the kids gonna hear this podcast at some point?
This got me😢. I’d have to stop for the kid too. Fucked up why it happened too
These type's of stories really make me question and wonder if there is a higher power out there looking over people.  If Brendan wouldn't have been there, who knows what this family would have done... They FOR SURE wouldn't have had raised 70k worth.  They also probably wouldn't have had somebody who is seeking out financial help for the kids.  Brendan was put there for some reason or another  I'm not a big bible thumper, I actually have never even read the thing, I've never been to church.  But I do have some sort of spirituality.  Man this story is a rough one.  Kudo's to Brendan.  Dude is one of a kind.
Came here ready to crack jokes.. nothing to Joke about here 🤭 The guy is actually a hero for what he did.
Prayers for all involved 🙏
Im impressed. I will not trash talk this guy anymore. You did the right thing pulling over and helping those kids.
Damn Brandon Love Homie
Schaub is really living up to his brand thick boy...
Thank you
I still don't believe a word this hack says.
I have a whole new respect for you Brendan. God bless you, and God bless that family.
He pronounced the ‘s’ in debris
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fun fact my mom was driving right beside that semi she got lucky and dodge it all because that semi would have straight destroyed her car
Fucking brutal. Thanks for helping.
Thank God for that Durango. If dude makes it across the 101 he could have just lit a lighter and nobody walks away. God bless you B Shaub! Thank you 🙏
Fuck Brendan. Like the comments have said however much we’ve clowned on you this shit was insane. Fucking hero.
Went from being a low key hater to big big fan of Brendan.
The Go Fund Me is not accepting donations anymore.  I would love to help the kids.  Will you guys update the link?
Hero
I hope aunty doesn’t help herself with a new BMW with that 70k raised.
Firstly, Mr. Schaub you are an absolute badass. You were the angel God sent to save those children. Thank you for giving them a chance. May their mother rest in peace and may their father pay every price in this life and after it ends.  If we want to talk about raising money in a fight for a good cause, why not challenge Logan/Jake Paul? Some would argue that might not be coming from moral grounds since 90% of Paul's viewers come from wanting the kid to be disintegrated, but if 100% of the proceeds go to a good cause who cares? (You could also argue that it's fucked that Paul would get glory from a woman's murder but like. Yk. Just an idea.)
wow this had me in tears..
Holy shit man you’re a great man
Never hated Brendan now I'm validated for liking him
You can hear the pain in his voice
Big Brown, you held it down. What a bamf. Solid! Respect, Sir
How come you've seen it all if the accident already happened??most of the times is not the 18 wheeler s fault...they do that for a living
Its diesel, its not just going to burst up in flames..even if you threw a cigarette at it...
Looked this up and the guy was jailed on 1 million dollar bail. Rest In Piece to the mom, and I hope those kids recover fully and mentally, it’s gonna be a tough road, when they grow up it will take time to come at piece knowing what their dad did and what happened to their mom.... such a hard thing to get through and except
jesus fucking christ this was hard to listen to. God Bless you Brendan. Wow
Yeah I've definitely got to throw this man some props... 🙏
I've met Brendan and the one thing that struck me about him was how big his heart is. I personally really like the guy, always have. My main concern is that those kids had to witness that and, to the extent that he did, Brendan will never forget this. I hope peace and healing come easily and quickly.
I used to see Brendan as paper thin. Just an ego or something, but I didn't watch enough. 😕 This man is a fucking hero. My bad Brendan, MUCH respect.
Always stop...
It sucks so much that such heartbreaking things everyday. At least this one Brendan was there and did a very great thing to help those poor kids. These kids hopefully they can get the mental help now to move forward and become good adults. Awesome job Brendan
Good man
bless ya man x real people put themselves in shit for others. respect to you.
"Never pull over for accident." Always stop to help others if they're in need of urgent help. In European countries it's mandated by law to stop and help others if you see an accident.
Those kids need to see real professionals to helo them work through this. If not this going to bite them forcthe rest of their lives. I wad 12 when mother shot and killed herself while I was alone with her and it has caused me massive anxiety for my whole life been on medication for 13years now because it was never dealt with when I was still a kid to please get these kids the help they need to over fome this. Thanks Brendan for being a real hero.
Brendan IS Captain America for doing this. It takes massive balls of steel to pull over on a highway in LA full of crazy drivers and homicidal/suicidal assholes, get out and walk towards oncoming traffic.
Love you brother. Thank you for stopping.
Cool story
Finally found a reason to like Brendan good on you brotherman
I’m really proud of you for being so brave but also for the vulnerability to speak about this publicly. Thank you for this.
Brendan, you are a hero
Your an amazing person Brendan god bless you for amazing thing.
New respect for Brandon Shawb
big respect man.... fuck the haters
fu*k me , what a story. That is a hero right there.
What a horrible tragedy.
As serious as this story is and big ups for Brendan but can we really ignore the fact that he pronounced debris like “debreeze” at 1:00
dorks
Brendan i'll respect you for life for this brother.
You are a genuine hero Mr Schaub
Well done Brendan. Courage and character bro!!
Wow what a tragedy she was beautiful and way too yong
Some people look at this story and say no god. I look at it and say God doing the best he can with free will  Brendan you're simply incredible.
Take what you seen and then add 30 yrs of it ?  Shootings, stabbings, beat to death , hung, mangled , headless, armless bodies? Getting shot at, 3 major operations, bad back, scars all over me?  Everyone loves that solider that spent 6 months in Afghanistan , Iraq ? The fireman who saves ppl ?  No one really likes me?  So I keep to myself and except for a few I pretty much don’t say much?  I am a carpenter/contractor now & that is my therapy because even therapist don’t care much for me? See I hv been involved in taking someone’s life or seriously hurting them?  I am a Retired Police Officer and I struggle to pay my dental bills , eyeglasses, medical?  I am not a public leech?  I was the guy you called when you heard that bump at 3am.  Now why I hear a person whail or cry out everything comes flooding back?  But no one really cares ?  I am looked upon as a racist, bully, cocky, violent white man who once wore a badge?  I hv two college degrees, thousands of hours of specialized training ; and numerous leadership classes, yet I am hidden, camouflaged purposely to stay out of sight?  I am a Retired Police Office please don’t look at me?
Damn I’m proud of you Brendan 😣
Oh wow ❤️❤️❤️❤️😭😭😭😭😭 You know Brendan I think the fate of this happening to you is that you are probably the only person in that moment that could have saved those kids and made this go viral as well as the help you are offering . I don’t think you talked about this on BTB so hearing about this randomly was pretty surprising.
Schaub is a such a fucking tool. Why did you tube recommend this video.
Dabreeze errrrrrwhere
Its deseil not gas. Great story though
Schaub gets my utmost respect from here on out. No more jokes.
Brendan might not be the best stand up... but he is a real stand up guy
Those kids need a positive male role model Brendan, you can be that guy.
Brendan m, idk if you read this but hit me up if you wanna talk about it. I’m a professional who works both in the medical and psychiatric field
You are a hero! Thank God for people like you Brendan
Brendan is a truly exceptional human being.
I’ve always been a fan of Brendans. This got me teary eyed and broke my heart. You’re a damn good man, Brendan.
What's on his ear?
Can't even begin to describe how amazing you are Brendan. You gave those kids a future and you should be incredibly proud of that.
Poor Lady and Children.
MAD RESPECT TO U BRENDAN  👍 THATS SOME REAL LIFE SHIT 💯💯💯🔥
Fuck yea bro. U did the most correct things u can ever do under the circumstances. Ur an angel sent from the lord to help those kids. Wow
Just gained a whole lotta respect for Brendan Schaub. HERO! 🙌
Character is who you are when no one is looking
Respect for doing what you did. No one knows if they’d be able to actually answer that call to action until you’re in that situation. You proved you are, and that’s not something every human can do. I hope you can find peace with that, and I hope those kids will find peace.
A hero? A fucking hero!? This is what all grown capable men should be required to do and how to act in these times.
That monster trying to not only end his life but take his whole family with him.. I really hope street justice gets to him before the authorities do.
Would’ve been nice if he had this much compassion for Bobby lee when he was telling him he got molested😭
I understand that the family will need time to grieve and we should give them privacy during that process but please keep us posted how the kids are doing.
You could always sense that Schuab is a really good dude, he just has the energy/aura about him where he comes off as a sensitive caring type of dude. This story makes me respect him 1000X more though. I feel terrible for those kids, seeing their mom like that at such a young age is the kind of life altering experience that can forever shatter a kids mind and scar their souls. It's awesome Schuab is raising money for the kids, hopefully can make sure it actually goes to the kids and not some greedy family member.
Man that's so sad. That brought a year to my eyes also. You can just see the pain Brendan is feeling for the whole situation
How do you clean your ears (not just the wax in the ear hole) when they are coli flowered that bad?
The man who gave you the weird look was the devil. He was trying to distract you from doing the right thing..Kudos to you brother
So much respect for Brendan.
Brendan, you are an absolute champion human being. Not many people have the heart to do what you did, and watching this video has absolutely touched me. I hope you can find some sort of peace from this,  keep doing your thing my man.
Ah Brendan, your such a fucking badass hero! DANA WHITE, REINSTATE HIM!
That low life dad wtf..
Water
Gnarly
Verified bad ass
i hate these people
diesel doesn't just ignite.
This is absolutely classless..selfish, narcassistic and so much more....... to exploit this horrible incident on this damn show. It's one thing to use this platform to promote the a fundraiser to help the kids. It's another to give VERY intimate details of what happened to include the Mom's brain matter??  While all of the discrepancies in your story are no surprise, to admit you held off telling your partner..because you wanted to "save it for the show" is a pretty jacked up thing to do.
Well done mate. Something similar happened to me when somebody drove into my house I found myself picking people out the car before even thinking about anything else. I believe it's just a natural thing to do.
WTF man. Brendan you did a good thing
How is he holding back tears. When I'm telling an emotional and it starts its over.
As a truck driver this is a nightmare I hope to never have to be a part of. I have come up on many terrible wrecks and have seen people do stupid stuff around trucks and trucks do stupid stuff around cars but I hope I never have someone choose my truck to end it. I have a buddy who i trained with through are companies cdl program and his 2nd night of driving after getting our cdl he had a guy run out out in front of him and commit suicide by truck cause he had blown his savings well everything at a north Seattle casino. Nothing he could do no time to really slow down but fucked him up cause he's human and even thought it'd not his fault he still saw it was involved . Hopefully these kids get with family that will keep them away from their fathers and live a life that would make their mama proud
Brandon rockin the Tribe hat, Nice! #Clevelandagainsttheworld
You are an angel dude
I looked at the GoFundMe a week later after this video was posted and it’s at $70k. Increíble impact. This is what the internet needs to be about.
shaub is a whole ass hero for this 💪🏾
A man as good as Brennan is one out of thousands. What an incredible guy.
Respect
Holy shit!
Damn Brendan.. you are the man. You are a hero. Good job brother.
Much respect brother. God bless
What is a CHP?
Damn man this shit is so sad.
Brutal man. I often laugh at Shaub's dooshiness but i commend him for having such a big heart and doing the right thing.
F**k yah bro Just got a lifetime fan brotha.
Respect
Whew! Hard shit but nice job man. 😥
🙏 to the children, momma rest in heaven.
Wow man.... that's heavy :\
Godamn, just when I was convinced Brendan was just Brenda. I was wrong, i apologize! ✊!
Brendan please get yourself some counselling for what u have seen.  Well done on everything you done. At the time and your continued support for the family.  Yes this does actually fall into the category of hero, I'm pretty careful with that label as well.  Love
What a story man... Proud of you Brendan!
Ban 18 wheelers
Testament to not doing anything your wife asks:1 :1
Dude you did something that words can't really portray. Keep updating on the fund
Yo! Brendan.. beyond humbled by this.. whole fam was in tears.. you are a real one brother 😌❤️👍 Humbled by your strength under such chaotic circumstances, that screamed fear and danger all around you.. forget a MMA or comedy belt.. you are a champ of human exceptionalism when it mattered most 😌❤️👍 Thank you for what you did homie.. you just gave courage and strength to so many people to do the right thing.. if they themselves are ever faced with such chaos. I can tell you wish you could have done more.. Trust.. you stood when and where it mattered. Thank you for what you told those kids man.. 😌💪❤️ you are a Champion 🏆🏆🏆
I hope brendans mental health isn't affected in Jesus name!   Rip
Girl told him to keep goin damn
Not every hero wears a cape. Much Respect Brendan.
That’s so sad and respect to Brendan. This story makes you realize what our first responders go through
Everyone commenting here just believes every single word they’re fed, no questions asked.  Good grief  (but I guess it does serve to help answer the ultra-perplexing question of how this egomaniacal douche could possibly still have an audience of any kind).   Me, I know all this sounds just melodramatic enough I instantly begin leaning toward thinking it’s just setting the stage for the stupid scandal ahead in the near future when the whole story is brought into question as likely 90% bullshit.  And then he’ll insist it isn’t, & it’ll be all this idiots-on-parade  back-and-forth nonsense. And meanwhile, what should be the only real question—who TF is SO unbelievably bored & without a life that they actually give a shit anyway—is completely ignored by just enough duncetards to keep this idiot on the air 🙄
You will have to ask yourself,  what if that was you on the side of the road,  would you pass by and do nothing?     That was a good call B, proud of ya.
He might be a shit comedian but he's a good dude . Well done Brendan
As much as everyone is making fun of Brendan, we get reminded once in while that he is an awesome human being! I hope that if i am in trouble someone like him drives by… Imma go donate something on that gofundme. Everyone go do that! I lost my parents when i was 4. Those kids do need all the help they can get! And they need to know that the world is not all pain and assholes. They need to know that there are good people out there, and there are lots of them. It took me 20 years to come to that.
God bless you brother 🙏🙏🙏
I was wondering why all the lanes were closed that day. It took over six hours to open the freeway again
Now fathem what police officers and paramedics go through on a daily basis. People want to give cops so much shit but you have to remember the shit they see day in and day out
Mad respect Brendan!!!!!!!!!! RIP Aimee Garcia, I hope those kids end up living a better life, God bless them!!!!!
Mad respect Brendan!!!!!!!!!! RIP Aimee Garcia, I hope those kids end up living a better life, God bless them!!!!!
Man I wish I saw more of this version of Brendan. Humble, self aware, and self reflecting. This is probably who he is often, but instead leads with this arrogant prick type energy that thinks he cooler than the world.
We can’t worry about those kids. We need to worry about kids in Afghanistan thousands of miles away from America. Cause that’s what are politics demand.
Man that is absolutely horrible. Praying for the kids
I'm really confused on why anyone, even more so a few 100 ppl gave this a 👎? .... Hopefully they all just mean thumbs down to this horrible situation. Schaub was a hero in that moment. Courageous, brave, and a saving grave to those children.
Wow! This is so sad and Brendan is a hero to say the least.
I don’t like go fund me because there’s no way to know that niece has the kids best interest. He needs to meet family in person and see living situations before anything.
God Bless you Brendan! 🙏 Rest in peace
There was da-breeze everywhere... ugh... meathead.
Brendan is a Hero! That was amazing, he looks like an excellent human being.
Breandan, What you did was absolutely full of courage and love. You inspired many people with this story with everything you said and did in that situation. Very Good thoughtful Moment you will never forget.
When did Bryan come back. I unsubscribed when he was gone but I’m definitely subscribing again now
Hero shit
Rogan talk about this yet?
A flow of gas... 18 wheelers run on diesel.  🤡
His wife told him to keep going.
Literally brought tears to my eyes wow ! May she RIP
I was a lifeguard and what I’nfound out was that people act so stupid in an emergency.. you did well keeping calm
Hey Brendan I know the feeling of what you went through. I was in the same situation. I was the sole witness of the accident and the cars were immediately in flames. None of the drivers got out so I was the one who had to make the decision of pulling them out. Very very ugly accident like the one you were involved with. I pulled the first man out unconscious and the second driver was a bugger guy and I pulled and pulled but just couldn’t get him out. Meanwhile the cars are still on fire. Unfortunately the driver of the car was deceased and I had to pull him out so his body wouldn’t burn.  Here is a video of my news clip. Feel free to reach out if you need someone to talk too that can relate. Because I know I could.  https://youtu.be/WlbKwR8Gj-Q
Great person
❤️🙏🏾
I’m not even halfway through and I’m already holding back tears
Brendan... Stay strong bro. Been there, cutting seat belts, smell of gas, blood, fire all of it. God bless 🙏 you and that family... GOD BLESS YOU BRENDAN!!!
Brendan is good dude
Wow what a story! Props to tfatk and Brendan for being heroes here
Now i know where louis J Gomez got his story from 😂😂😂
I'm a dad of three kids. This story made my cry, man.  Thank you Brendan for making the right choice at the right time. I do hope you are able to get passed the horrific scene that you saw.  All the love to you and your familiy. Your kids have a hero for a dad.
Ur a legend bro!!
You did what you had to do brother. We speak your name.
Ive shit on blender schlaub before but hes a good man for this
Bro sorry you saw that, if you need help find someone that does emdr. I have ptsd from work as corrections officer. This emdr treatment has help me process the shit I saw. Also Prazosin is a medication I take to stop the nightmares. Hat off to you for getting involved in their time of need.
Brendan has balls of steel
respect brendan
I was hoping it was Brendan in the accident
That's insane
oof this tugged on the heart strings. really had me lookin at myself. what a fuckin HERO and legend mr shwab <3
I'm a tow truck driver on the turnpike. I was going to call and on the way their I see a one vehicle accident I almost hit the guy with my flatbed. But I pulled over and ran towards the van mind you it's pitch black 4am on Florida turnpike mm172. Long story short something whispered go back to the truck and as soon a I did I see headlights coming. An SUV hit the guy that was trapped in the car head on so hard they ripped the motor out and they flew in air like in the movies. Me and the trooper pulled up were looking for dude for a minute and couldn't. Find him. To make it short we found him hanging dead on the guard rail with his leg ripped of. Work aother one the day were the lady hit a guy doing 15 mph and she ended up sideways and as she was getting out she got hit by another car and she exploded. The coroner can't pick everything up. I towed the car but loading it and cleaning the road was the worst.
Had to stop watching... Brendan gets my medal of honor!
Thank you Brendan!!!!!
Wow you are an amazing man Brendan and them kids are so lucky to have such a strong brother and a super hero like you in their life!
Man, this is incredible. THIS IS BEING BRAVE
Brendan is top 0.0000000001% of the population when it comes to being human.
Liar
I'm seriously failing to see the reason why half the people in the comments are putting a big emphasis on Schaub as a comedian, literally has nothing to do with this situation other than the fact that that's what he does. Let him be be vulnerable and talk about what happened for fuck's sake.
I clown Brendan so much but goddam did he do something heroic. my opinion has changed
Shappelle gaining some lbs
Bryan Bro what happen you ok  Schaub oh ya bro but ill tell you on the show... wtf..? Lol
Love you Brother.. what you did was amazing, stay up.
On July 17 2018 I was a 15 year old volunteer fire fighter, I responded to an mvc with passengers trapped 2 doa. Which eventually turned into 5 doa upon discovery when we broke apart the van. A family from New Jersey were enjoying their holiday weekend when a truck crossed over the median causing a head on collision with the van resulting in the van rolling nose tail nose tail nose tail until it landed back up right. When I arrived on scene there was loose luggage and mangled car bits. We covered the van with tarps to shield any views for the public while we worked on removing the mother from under the dash. She was the only one to survive and quoted, “ I wish I died I lost everyone I loved there’s no reason for me to be here anymore.” When she was in the hospital room with her aunt. A truly heartbreaking story that resulted in me developing ptsd and depression. I try not to think about this often but when I’m alone and trapped in my mind, it feels like it’s the only episode that’ll play on the tv in my head. If I can offer one piece of advice. The fastest you can forgive a memory the easier it’ll be to forget.
Brendan adopt those children you are a wonderful father
I had a very similar experience on a MDW  leaving Las Vegas south towards California State Line late night early morning as I am hungover af, but helped family of 4 Father,  Mother and Son and Daughter ... My best friends sister and I and a other  motorist pull a little boy and girl ... and all I will remember was the little girl saying the same thing “I don’t wanna die , I don’t wanna die” 💔 I know God made me leave that Vegas weekend for a reason 💯  I hope I was able to help them any way 🙏🏼
This hurts my heart.
Wow. Well done B. Good man
Tragic💔💔. I'm sorry to the Mom and her sons.    If you take suggestions, I agree with Brian. Counseling would be great for them. Not a year but atleast 5 years of Counseling with an amazing psychologist, possibly daycare costs for the baby to ensure positive interactions with you his/her age. Or food and clothing money sent each year to ensure that they have self care needs met. I'm sorry for this family but all of this happened for a reason and I think Brendan is going to be a lifetime hero. Many blessings and please check on your people.
As a truck driver I've been in Brendan shoes u can't unsee the horrors that happen on the sides of interstates the movies don't even come close to seeing actual horrific trauma feel better bro you are a hero to those children 🙏 may God bless them!
I always liked Brendan. And now have a large amount of respect for the man as well. Well done, sir.
This is horrible; but did the mother not know what the father was planning?  (Probably something we will never know now that I think about it).
Louis J. Gomez brought me here. Louis told the story but put himself as Brendan and changed a few  details the LOS way.
18 wheelers thank god don't use gas they use diesel.. you drop a match into a bucket of diesel it will not ignite.
This dude Brendan is a hero .
Amazing story and an amazing thing you did Brendan. Life
Fuck man 😔😔😔😭😭😭. Love you Brendan
Legend.
Leave it to shaub to be an absolute hero but i cant be on his side 100% bc of that racost ass hat lmao, good shit tho dude is a hero
This is tough RIP to the mom, god bless the kids
Fuck man. Fuck. Jesus christ 😔
Let’s start respecting Brendan from now on. Hero.
The gift of free will !! U CAN BRING LOVE OR DISASTER . Thank you  Brendan Schwab you’re a good Samaritan great job 👍🙏
OMG! Brendan, you made me cry. God bless you!
Bendan's wife is a real piece of work for wanting to drive away from a kid in an accident. I've stopped at a bunch of accidents and helped people.
I fucking hated Brendan for so long, but mad props and respect for this ❤
Horrifying story full respect Brendan you would of leathered him,I would of held him and then leathered him,I've donated to the gofundme,,respect from (UK),,, Conwy North Wales.
It says a lot about our society that anyone’s first thought was to question this in the first place. Shame on you if you thought it made you noble to “research” this. Brendan, you’re a good man and we need more people like you. Never change kid. 💙  This also sounds like a scene from Final Destination, I can’t even fathom how traumatic this is for Brendan and those people and children involved… even Brendan’s wife who had to witness this ordeal fearing for her husband’s life. I’m 9 months pregnant with our first baby and hearing this is especially painful, but I know my husband and family only hope people like this would do the same for me. Please don’t be upset at yourself Brendan, what you did was unbelievable and beyond what so many people have the capacity to show in love. Sending well wishes and love.  Edit: ANYONE OUT THERE CURRENTLY IN A DOMESTIC  VIOLENCE SITUATION, PLEASE SEEK HELP 🙏 I know women, especially as Mothers, we stay so often for our children and our hearts just keep that glimmer of hope that our partner will change… please, don’t hold out for someone who hurts you to change.
God damn Brendan, you are incredibly brave. As are those wonderful children.  I hope they live a great life and prosper.  RIP to the mother.
His girl telling him to ignore the 7 year old asking for help is a HUGE red flag
Damnnnnnnn…
People hate on Brendan because they’re jealous. End of story. The guy has become successful at just about everything he sets out to do, he takes chances and he wins a lot of the time. It’s the same reason people on Rogan. If this story still doesn’t give you an idea of how good a person he is then you’re just a bitter jealous asshole and nothing will ever change your mind. The world needs haters like you anyway.
God bless you brother !
Luis J. SCHAUB is a fucking hero. LoS brought me here
As a truck driver and seeing this happen before the truck driver is going to need mental help too.   Sooo freaking sad.  I hope more women see this story and understand they need to get out of situation by all means necessary..      Great job Brandon.
Big time bro hug with all the love Brendan. Hold your head high after this one.  I'm having one for you tonight buddy.
When did “18 wheelers” start running on gas? I thought they ran on diesel
Well done Brendan. God bless you.
As much as people trash Schuab he’s a beat for this one!! Thick boy got me in tears on this story man
I was not ready to watch this.
Real life Hero.
Hero
Wait, that’s just funeral costs? That is horrific.
Thank you.
I was never a fan of Schaub but I guess I am now.
Brendan literally has to call the kid out for being out of shape that had nothing to do with the story like did we need to know the kid was chubby his mom was literally brutally murderd
LONG LIVE CHIEF WAHOO
Even though we all clown on Brendan I think we all could tell he’s a good guy and really cares about others. Thank god we have people like him ❤️
Fuck man I can’t believe you did this. Your a fucking hero to them kids bro. I don’t know anyone in the video but your a goddamn angel. Thank you so much
Brendan, your a hero brother. Super proud of you for getting out and helping those kids. Most people would’ve kept driving. You did a good thing m, I’m sorry for what you had to see. God bless you
How could you say I wasnt going to stop then call other people pieces of shit? Wow..... I would have stopped and tried to help no matter the situation.
Hero moves for sure & big bonsai balls by Brendan, however it appears Brendan doesn’t realize just how close he came to a fiery demise along with the kids. By his own words, he was soaked in gasoline from the waist down while undoubtedly standing in the stuff so when he grabbed the car door that was tangled metal on metal and he tried to pull the door open… see where I’m going with this? He’s lucky he didn’t succeed getting the door open. Surely the angels were looking over this heroic numbskull. Blessed indeed & hooray for the happy ending. Score one for the Good Guys. Here’s hoping the sick prick that got away after hit by the SUV has succumbed to internal bleeding behind the bushes of Balboa park
So sad. God bless you B. And the family and children involved.
Brandon is  a good dude .I'd be a wreck after that.
You did right, B Schaub
Make sure you get some therapy bro that shit can come back to haunt you in a year or two
I saw this on fb much respect and love and good vibes
Got mad respect for Brendan Schaub.  Thank you for being human.
Dayyuummm Brendan ...I hated you I have a new whole other level of respect for you next time I see you I won't try to fight you..lol..bless you
❤️🙏 to you and the family
I love that Brendan doesn’t even like rly recognize what he did he’s not sittin there acting like a hero or nun he’s j genuinely concerned abt a group of suffering siblings. Nothing but respect to you Brendan🙏🏻. Doesn’t mean your not gonna start getting clowned again in the future though
Hes gonna tell this story a million fucking times...
Big respect
You are the man Brendan !
NICE CHANGE FROM GOSSIP AND BRO TALK.   REALLY NICE. DIFFERENT SIDE OF THE GUY
..one thing I want to say to everyone who drives.. KEEP A FIRE EXTINGUISHER IN YOUR VEHICLE!!!... i don't understand why more people don't.. it could save someone's life.. a lot of the times it's the fire from the car/truck accident that kills..
I cried
This had me in tears!
Teach the kids martial arts so they have respect, confidence and discipline
Way to go Brendan!
What a lovely guy
This seems made up.
Brendan, you saved those kids lives bro....you are a hero.
CA has already filed murder charges against him. He'll have a lot of time to set and think about what a piece of garbage he is.
Rule 303.  Great job Brendan!🙏
I hope that guy doesnt get to his kids ever again
Ok, guys. Idk about you, but I ain’t making any more jokes about Brendan. They’re fun and lighthearted, sure, but this man deserves all our respect. Good heart.
Your a a good man Brendan.
Wow. No good Samaritan laws in the US? You are a champ and did what any decent person would you. If my partner told me to keep going, I'd hate her slowly for the rest of our marriage.
Likely diesel fuel which is hard to ignite without compression. You may sleep better
I used to hate on Brendan. I’m sorry and I love you brother!
As a firefighter I want to tell you that's your a fucking Hero bro. Keep Talking about this and don't keep it Inside. These Things can mess with you.
Brendan Schaub you are a fucking saint. May God bless your life son
Brendan, it was always all love, buddy!
You are a true American Brendan.  Much love
Wow. Did not expect this. Way to go man.
Holy fuck man that’s just sad 😞
God bless you Brendan. Amazing job. Those kids got to meet Superman. Their mom may be an angel but she’ll live with them forever and so will you! You are now a champion, a legend and the GOAT. Not many would do that. Idk if I could.
Respect
Big respect to Brendan for being a hero, and preventing that baby from seeing a majorly traumatic scene!
Respect, Brendan. Shit had me choked up.
Who the fuck dislikes this video, cmon...l
He's lying. The first responders were interviewed about this and none of them even remember seeing h there.
Where are my go-mites?
gained alot of respect ✊
Wow
Well done BS. We'll done.
Where guys gone for a while? This is not an old podcast is it ??
I heard about this thru a 3rd party. Hearing it straight got me all choked up. That's so traumatic for everyone involved. I hope that thing sits in isolation for the rest of its pathetic existence.
It’s alway right to do the right thing.  Good on you man.
Mad respect to Shaub. Absolutely horrifying story and tragic for the mother and children. But incredible, brave action from Brendan.
I wish someone helped me...18 years of beatings now Im back helping care for the same people that abused me and Im being abused AGAIN....thank you for helping them ..
Myyyy godddd...
Incredible
Great story. He was at the right spot in the right time.
Welp, its official.. i love Brendan Schaub
Adopt them
This Story triggers my PTSD, Brennden will likely suffer some side effects from the incident. I always liked Big Brown, now i Love him!
Respect bro….. wow prayers for the kids and you man….
How the hell am I gonna rip on Brendan now...damn. much respect to Brendan
Fk that why you did is what makes you different than those people that wouldn’t that DIDN’T stop… fate put you there for a reason and SHOW THEM WHAT A REAL MAN LOOKS LIKE…. Mentorships do so many things for kids but the mentors
Brendens a hero
Bryan is a fucking soulless robot. Why did they let that sociopath back?
Much respect rip to the mother prayers for the kids
Well that goes to show that shine of the sun will occasionally gleam on the ass of a dog. Good work Schaub.
To have the courage and determination to go head first into that situation and save those kids is nothing less than heroism. The fact that you were able to be composed enough in the moment to think not only about the kids safety, but also thinking about their mental well-being, i praise you for making sure they didn't have to suffer any more trauma by seeing what you saw and getting them out of the scene.  I can't Imagine how hard that would have been to be the only one there to help and to have seen it all yourself. But you did something not everyone would. You put yourself in harms way to save those children. Major respect.
Brendan earned his stripes doing this! Well done Brendan, you changed those kids lives forever!
Find someone who can foster or adopt four children under the age of eight!
I've never been a fan of Schaub, but he definitely has my respect. He shouldn't have thrown his girl under the bus though...
Thanks for sharing!
Look.. who gives a fuck if his comedy and sence of humor are horrible or you think he's a duche.. he truly deserves recognition for this... my best friend died in a bad accident and had someone stopped sooner he would of had a better chance to live. Big props homie!
He lied about the entire thing. Just like he lies about everything else.
$30000 to bury someone that you love. Just think about that. How messed up is that really!!
ngl, does anyone think he may have caused it ? Idk man. Mark my words. maybe not but I just have a feeling. Who flees a crime scene. Somethings up here. His gf freaking out. IDK, man. something stinks. He appears very guilt. There's no real exact information. You could say he was acting on instinct but its clear it was done in a collected manner.
he went up into highway traffic, next to a damaged oil tanker, covered in oil, to save kids out of a mangled car that could’ve caught fire, while keeping them from seeing a gruesome dead body 1 foot away from his face, all while a fucking active murdered had his eyes trained on him behind his back. This is the greatest story I think I’ve ever heard
Jesus dude I'm never gonna make fun of Brendan again. You have my utmost respect man
Brendan you are one if a kind my friend.
…Roy Nelson would have gotten the door off. Just sayin.
So was the Mexican in the tank top the dad driving?
Fuck...... man i wasn't trying to tear up today. Damn schaub you are fucking hero dude you are a fucking hero
😭 how can a dad hurts his kids like that....
Wish I could shake his hand..
Thank you brendan
Men get called heroes for things that are expected of us, if you do it they call you a hero but if you don't you are a coward.
Doesn’t sound like he’s lying. It would be a pretty good lie tho
Earned a WHOLE NEW LEVEL of respect for you Brendan!! Much love!! Prayers goin up for you and that poor family... heartbreaking.
Big up Brendan schaub!
I've always liked Brendan. All the haters can kiss his whole asshole 😂
The go fund me is shut down is there any other way to help
Those 3 boys are fighters💪🏽
He was the only one on the highway? I'm sincerely asking ....
Good job Brendan!  👏🏼.  God bless you and those kids, plus all the families involved.  🙏🏼
How do Paramedics, Law enforcement, and Fire fighters do it. Live with having to see the horrific side of humanity at those scenes.   Thank you to them for your sacrifice.   *I have a Friend who was trying out for Hazmat. He quite after he went to a scene where there was a dead child. He had nightmares for weeks because of it. Seeing death can shake you up
I think it's disgusting that people had the audacity to say he made this story up.  That the lady had to come forward to verify he was there.  So disgusting
Good thing about diesel is it doesn't ignite as easily as gas.
Schaub is a narcissist and he’s lying about his involvement. He never left his car
This hit me in my chest like a freight train.
This had me bawlin.  Thank you, Brendan!  I love you for doing what you did!
Dude Brendan I know how hard that is, I had it opposite way where I had to see the mothers & Father’s reaction & hear their screams of pain / terror & horror of the State Trooper telling them that some idiot hit my friend & killed her (ran a stop sign & ran out onto the highway & hit my friends Kawasaki Ninja 250 , which she never sped in & the accident Evidence scene showed she was going the speed limit), but she was going to meet me & my friend at chipotle for a quick chill & hang session & we didn’t even realize she was less than 1 minute ahead of us on the road, & her bike blew up & the State Troopers needed us so they could identify her, so they knew who died, & then they had us take them to her parents house, so they can tell her parents she was killed, At 18 & Our Class Co-Valedictorian, who had her whole life ahead of her, BUT HER MOTHER & FATHERS REACTIONS .....HAUNT THE SHIT OF ME, CUZ ITS SOOO TERRIBLE TO HEAR THE LEVEL OF PAIN IN THEIR SCREAMS & PLEAS, & Only the other was Home, so we had to take her a few streeets away to where her husband & the victims Father was working at, & then She took him & explained it to him & my Backseat & to hear & see his Face is forever ingrained in my Brain as his her Primal yells & pleas, jeez it’s tough Brendan But you Just have to Deal With it & vent, connect with the other guy who helped you at the scene cause he saw it too & understands it what it was like there ...
God bless you Brendan.
Brendan is a guardian angel
the fact that everyone was clowning him and calling him a liar when this story was first released was really sad. im happy for what you done for the kids and how you saved there life brendan. truly saddening and horrific. i hope those kids find peace..
Thick boy to the rescue. You are a great man, 👍 I will pray for the kids.
The Champ is here!!!!! Amazing people do amazing things. You forever have an Angels for you your family sir. Amazing.
I like Brendan, always have. As much as people like to tease him I have always just seen the good heart.
He's still a douche. But that does not mean he is not a good human being
Respect
HERO
Damn dude...get your Dish fixed....how can you even hear? 30K for a Funeral? You re getting scammed.....
Jesus man good job schuab ur a hero for this one
335 assholes disliked this clip, many more good people in this world thank god
I don’t like his comedy but he is a good person for doing that
Stand up Guy 💪💪💪
He’s still an idiot, but that was a good thing he did
"Has his own demons."  Yeah he does. Like literally. From what he did to getting hit by a car and getting back up and the sadistic smile. Man's got legions.
I’ve always known he was a great dad. It showed right there.
Those kids lost their mum in such a horrible way
God bless you, Brendan.
Light always prevails from dark situations those kids be alright. Well done Brendan truely huge what you did. X RIP mom
What was the mom doing during all of this she just put the kids in the car with him to go to heaven I don’t understand that part of it props to Shaub . Did he say when they got in the car he said we’re all going to heaven today who knows that’s crazy
tearing up just listening to this, heart goes out to those kids man
Oh shit I didn’t know this show was still on lol that’s what’s up
That's why its important to help people when you can because you could end up being someone's answered prayer. I'm of the belief that there are points in our timeline  where divine timing is at play. The 333 people who dislike this video don't know that 333 represents divine intervention/protection. Those children had something looking out for them <3 kudos Brendan
Wow….! Those kids are alive today because of Brendan’s selflessness. True hero, so much respect man. I’m sure the kids will get the help they so desperately need.
I was not ready for this
Your a better man than most Brendan Schaub...well done for saving those kids 🙏
❤❤❤
He will live with the image of that lady for the rest of his life.
You have to be a real asshole to thumbs down this video. Mad props to Brendan. You're a hero.
Schaub is a legit hero
May God bless you Brendan
Get them a house!
W
SUCH RESPECT TO BRENDAN.
Damn.
ill shit!
That’s a crazy horrible story! Much props for getting outta your car and helping those kids
I love how every person Schaumburg describes is either normal or “out of shape” 🤣🤣
I'm a truck driver and this is my worst nightmare. You're a beast for stopping
Don’t be a bystander. You’re amazing Brendan
I take back every bad thing I every thought about this dude
Respect to brendam
Wait a minute, so that news story about the dad who tried to kill his kids in Encino....it was Brendon who saved them? Holy shit 👏👏👏👏
Brendan just when you couldn't be any dumber...you go and do something like this. AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF!
Totally not fabricated
Brendan is objectively a good guy. Poor kids man.
Watching this first thing in the morning.  Holy shit.  Idk what to say man.  Just thank you.
God kills the innocent and rewards the evil.
Got me at work tearing up. What a hero Brendan is, as well as her oldest son.
Takes a true man to do something like this - Brendan you should know you're an absolute hero for this and I never use that term lightly. Take time to take care of yourself after such a traumatic experience - RIP Aimee <3
Lots of deleted comments here…….
never understood why people take the piss out of Shaub. My guy seems like a lovely human.
Big ups to Brendan. That’s life changing. He’s gonna be a completely different person from now on, and he did it all for those strangers. Mad respect.
Respect to you Brendan. Much respect.
Whatever you think of the man you have to respect his actions here. Incredibly brave and shows his true character.
Hero ✌️
Damn. That’s fucking nuts. I watched this before starting another shift as a truck driver. I hope I never have to encounter that.
Are they deleting negative comments? All I hear about is how this story is fake and the police and fire dept. have no record of any civilian helping these people. Ntw why would he tell the world that his shithead wife told him to keep going? Holy shit
Man that was very noble of you I totally get where u are coming from by stopping where the accident took place I would have done. The same thing much respect Brendan
Wow... the  pain is so much. Just sll around. Mad props to Schaub on this one. I hope he heals too... I can't even imagine
Brendan Schaub do the right thing and Adopt these Beautiful Children!
I kill all spies that don't work for me. I work for spies. There's no excuse for them not to work for me unless they are committing suicide
Say what you want about Schaub, dude's a real man and a hero. U can't say that about 2% of the UFC roster.
The guy didn’t die ?
Touched my heart no lie. You won the fans Brandan
Who raises the kids?  ANYBODY ELSE!
Is there a reason Brendan didn't look at Chapel?
Love you B
Luckily it was actually diesel, not gas. Diesel is known to ignite as easily as gas.
One of saddest things I’ve heard in these last couple of shitty banner years composed of no shortage of tragedies
Hero. God bless you man.
I have disliked Brendan as an entertainer for a long time but this is very admirable and he is a good man for being selfless in a dangerous situation to help some kids I have a lot of respect for him, how you act in real life situations is way more important than anything else and he stepped up when he had the chance and that’s a good role model for young men
Talk all the shit you want about his fighting career, he's a great human. Period
As thick as this room?
I was a nurse for a very short time. I'm not a guy that could handle what I saw. I hope Brendan let's go of what he saw. If it's possible.
Brendan is a good man.
So the family was targeted by the dude driving the car the wrong Way,??
Always good in people. I’m glad you’re able to help them. More power to you man
He's fos. Fake. To try and get his career back on track.
heroism. respect brendan.
Good on you Brendan! Every man is to do the same thing, no doubt about it!
I don’t like brendan but for that he gets a pass for me in the future if something comes out
Never likes brendan. I do now. Brendan help those babies
I wasn’t expecting this. My heart breaks for this mother and these children, and for you Brendan. I hope you can find some peace some day from this.
Fuck man, I couldn't imagine this shit happening
I heard this story but had no idea Brendan was first on the scene...damn your a hero man hope you recover from this trauma..
After over a decade, this is the first time I feel respect for Brenden.  Good work bud, get those kids squared away bro.
Is Brendan fighting again? That ear looks brutal. Maybe I’ve just never noticed it
Jesus fucking Velociraptor. Don't be afraid to see someone about this, seriously.
Good job Schaub.  Mad respect.
I ain't a fan of Brendan by any means, but respect for this. And I highly doubt he's lying. Even if there is inconsistencies, that probably has more to do with his own trauma and shock from the situation aswell as if it obviously fucking with his memory. As it probably would with anyone.
Fucking heart breaking that shit made me cry Brandon schaub you're a fuckin hero
Way to go Brandon.  That's what real dads do ! We all ways help children never lose that father spirt . God bless you and your family
Thank you 🙏
Respect brother, you were a hero for those kids. You were there for a reason. Look into rapid eye therapy for the PTSD.
Brendan, you're a good soul
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Throw a couple of prayers for the 18 wheeler driver as well. As a fellow driver that can mess someone up.
Oh, Brendan, there are NO words to thank you for diving in to save those kids! You're a literal hero, so fucking proud of you, never ever change!
You’re a stud my friend! Respect bro
Only Schaub could make a story this incredible, overly dramatic and make me hate him more.
Mad respect, Brendan; you are a real hero.
Brandon Schuab has the heart of a saint. What he did here was literally super hero-esque. Those children lives were better because Brandon was there.
when you can tell, when someone...really cares...adis a genuine person. it, it really hits different. Genuine people are so hard so come by, you all have no clue. Brendan is a genuine guy.
In tears. Omfg.
Thank you for doing that Brendan Schuab!  You are amazing.
We lived in a Fuk’d up world
That man is a hero. Period. Keep that brain sharp bro. Stuff like this can mess you up. True hero bro.
Brendan Schaub is a damn Hero! such a sad sad situation to have happened but thank all that is good for Mr. Schaub's quick reaction and nerves of steal!
Coming from Schaub I wouldn't be surprised if most of this story was a fabrication, he is a lying weirdo.
Brendan... You rock dude. Heard about this but just now getting the full story. You're a good guy dude. 👍
1st time brendans been real, BIG RESPECT for the man. Thats real hero manouvers 🙌🏾 💔 for the family
My pregnant wife was in an accident this morning and walked away unscathed, but we were obviously both shaken. To hear this story and what could happen, so soon after that incident, really hit hard. I cried all the way through that. I've made fun of you in the past Brendan, and I still don't love your comedy, but I'll be a lifelong fan of your character. You're a great man, and I'm glad you're using your platform and outreach to help these kids.
I respect what Brendan is doing for the kids but no one has ever been hit by a truck at 60mph and just got up and walked away. Brendan is over egging his omelette on that part
man im tearing up listen to this, truly heartbreaking,
Jesus this hit different sorry that happened man
Shit happened in Colorado last yr one came down I70 and killed some ppl not being able to stop
Brendan you are a good man. God bless your heart and your family. Good deed.
Go on JRE
Jesus Man,that sounded horrific,I hope Brendan gets the credit he deserves
All the respect in the world to Brendan for his quick actions, but man I can’t even imagine the horror story paramedics cops and firefighters have. Probably too many stories like this to remember
Two take aways from this. 1. Brenden is a hero. 2. He should break up with his girlfriend.  Yeah. I'll say it.
he might suck at comedy, hosting podcasts, being on podcasts, fighting and being relatable, but hes a good fuckin dude. even though he's had me blocked on insta for almost 2 years now. pussy.
That was incredible and brave  man you man!! 👏
such a real one Brendan. you could always tell that deep down he’s a great guy. real hero
Ladies please run for the hills with your kids if a thing pretending to be a man hurts you or your kids. Please remember that love is about respect. Simply beg neighbours or friends for help. Trust me there are people wanting to help stop this!
That kid helping you save his siblings is just as much a hero as yourself.
Brendon you sir are a hero!
That dad 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Proud of you Brendan, God bless you and your family
Shit. It brought tears to my eyes!! Well done mate!!
Brendan, well done Man. Not just for helping the night of but for helping afterwards. World Class.
Damn Brendan . You always make me laugh .. genuine good  man . I’m a grown man with children and I’m bawling . Been through a similar situation. You did a great thing .. keeping the children from seeing it really helped more than they will ever understand
All the shit people talk about Brendan means nothing. They can be petty all they want but the fact of the matter is that when the chips were down on the table, Brendan f’n went all in. He’s a damn hero and this is something that he won’t be able to forget ever. This changed him forever. You can tell it shook his soul.   Much love goes out to those poor kids. I hope they find a light to guide them throughout the rest of their lives. So damn tragic.
jesus christ this is fucking horrific
I've laughed at all the Schaub jokes in the past, but I gotta say....if I were ever involved in a situation like that, I know Schaub would be the type to pull over and help without question.
brendan:has serious take brendan:wears chief wahoo hat and pin
This story hurt, but I'm glad you shared it.
🧢
Hero
I’ll tell you on the show so I can make money off this sad story. Haha what a tool dude
Fuck it dude...I like Brendan. The guy is hero
I cried my eyes out when I heard this, soon as Brendan got choked up I did too, he's a legend, saved those kids lives ❤
Mad respect Brendan, thank you for sticking up for the kids!
God bless you for being a decent human. I will pray for them poor kids. 🙏
You're a good man and I can't believe what that clown tried to do
Good on ya! Brendan! wow you are a hero! because you saved those kids!
This shit had me in tears. Brendan is a great dude.
Brendan, man! You're a hero, dude! Much respect! Will be praying for those kids... so sad. But luckily they survived.
Good man.
Fuckin A
god damn b
Brendan a fucking real one
Look how beautiful that woman is how could any man hurt that woman why in the hell would anyone want to kill their family it breaks my heart when women or kids get killed over stupidity and now those children will be without a mother it's a sick twisted world. We have people who build sandcastles that are beautiful  it takes them hours of work and then you have people who run over and jump on it completely destroying all the hard work and that is the reality of human nature we have people who just want to see the world burn but we also have people who just want to make the world a better place a more loving place. Our greatest hope is that most people are good people because if most people were bad we would walk outside fighting to the death everyday like they did thousands of years ago so everybody needs to start working on themselves and make yourself the best human you can possibly imagine. That's the only way this world gets more loving and caring, we must work on ourselves before we start working on the world because all the problems are within the individual. Be kind be nice to people be generous and start caring about people because if you're miserable and you're making people around you miserable than you're adding to human suffering on this Earth it's because of you so please fix yourself before you try to fix the world. 💯🇺🇸🙏🙏🙏
First episode that made me cry in a long time
Chief Wahoo! Never Forget.
Dude that is the most fucked up story I’ve ever heard. Did they catch the devil that did this?
I respect what he did he didn't have to stop but he did cuz he cared and the world we live in today we need more Jesus everyday
This is terrible. God help those precious kids.
Good job brendan.  Respect 💯
What the fuck man.. holy shit. Mad respect Brendan. As a parent this hit the feels hard. That was heroic. God bless.
Great job brotha. Your a hero.
get joe r on the case with spotify.......his cash deal and see if spotify can have a charity event
Brendan is a gangster for what he did!
Fucking *RESPECT* bro!!
$30,000 for a funeral sounds extravagant …. Someone is trying to pocket a little of that cash.   Chances are the husband had already killed her and put her in the front seat…or she was complicit with his suicide plan.    Lots of questions here.   Not to mention if her head was crushed like Brendan said then there is nothing to view at the funeral for it to cost so much anyway.
You are a good man Brendan. A hero. You have my respect sir.
Whole situation sucks… all around. Would’ve been worse if they lost both their mother AND their father, regardless of how horrid he was. They didn’t have much of a father to lose, and I suppose they did lose him in a way.  What great children they are.. bless that boy who got on top of the car
Few people in our society have the SACK of BALLS it takes to stop and help in a situation like that now days Brendan !!!
Now those kids are alone 😓 maybe Brendan will adopt them .   On a serious note Big brown you r a hero
Thank you for doing what you did Schaub
Plot twist: Schaub was driving the 18 wheeler
Your a great guy Brenden. Unfortunately we live in a messed up world where crazy people do crazy things. At least the kids have a future because of you.
As someone who's seen a couple of dead people. I'm always  interested in how other people react when they see one. It's either people are totally calm or it breaks them to some degree.
Brandon needs a new GF. How can she want to continue to drive when kids are waiving for help??
Don't smoke weed after having a traumatic experience. It's enough to push you over the edge it happened to me 7 years ago and I'm still messed up
For your information Brendan I cried when you where telling this I’ve seen a horrific accident but was never in a position to help  Well done man because you know you carry that shit to the grave  Much love brother x
Fuck that! Brendan WAS Captain America for those kids that day. Don't sell it short. Hero for sure.
Fuck brendan well done wat a fucking world
I literally cried
I heard the mom put schaubs "comedy" album on the car radio and the dad had to end it
🙏🙏🙏
Where are the haters now?
Wow Karma got that Crazy Father with the Dodge Right away... who wonders what he would've done if the car didn't hit him.
Jez Fair play to him for doing this  He has a good heart
Well played Schaub, well played.
For all the shit Brendan has gotten over the years, I will forever respect him for what he did. Brought a tear to my eye when he talked about the mom and hiding the kids from seeing it.
Hats off. Thank You.
I bet he could not wait to tell everyone how great he was
I call for public executions of men who can do this.  I wanna watch it happen
Us real fans and not fakes who always loved Brendan Schaub and all the jackasses who talked so much trash about Brendan can finally understand he is an amazing person. I was always a fan and always will. Love ya @Brendan Schaub, your a hero 🙏✊
Proud of you bro, Hope you get to heal mentally
LoS #569 👍👍
Hero of "outta shape" people, Shaub Norris yo.
Oouf, this makes my heart ache. Well done Brendan. 👏
Much respect to this man!🙏🏽
Incredible.
Mom was so young. Shit sucks, RIP aimee 👏good job Brendan I wasn’t a fan so much but nice going not everyone would have risked it. Be Careful everyone. God bless
jesus this story dam near got me in tears
Love the hat dude.
This broke my heart! Gained a fan today, YOU were ment to be there to protect those boys from seeing that! Poor boys! This was tragic!💔
Mad Respect to Brendan 🙏  prayers to the family affected and you Bro.  Not a lot of people would of done what you did
Not trying to be insensitive but it doesn't cost $30,000 to bury someone.
It's nice and all but we all know shuab was dying to tell everyone the story
Respect to all of you, who stop to give a helping hand to those in need.  Love you Cabrones
18 wheelers have all the gas in the world.  Lol  Brendan, good on you for this man.  Legit hero shit.
man I'm a loss for words
God blessed you Brendan!
Brendan once parked an 18 wheeler in his butt.....sideways
Respect to Brendan man. The dude's a hero
God’s work Brendan 😇
Maximum respect real hero and that's a fact
Man, they should setup a separate GoFundMe for the kids. I'd donate.
You're a hero brother. I have the highest amount of respect for you Brendan!
Respect
Man so happy ..wen I clicked this video I thought it was about  Brandon.. thanks for NOT listening to ur girl and pulling off man God bless u brother! This world has a “not my problem mentality” but is all of our problem. Thanks man🙏🙏🙏
My love to Brendan may your mind be at peace brother your a hero u being there was something extra if not u who brother u where there for a reason
Props to this guy, but can we talk about his girlfriend or whatever wanting to keep going. TF is wrong with you
My heart goes out to you Brendan, words can’t express the heart you showed in a very difficult situation.
Fuckin Legend xxxx
brendan is a true hero man, much love and respect bro
Brendan is officially on that god tier of good guys. So much respect for you if you read this mr Schuab
Thank you thank you Brendan. I don’t know any of these people, or you. But thank you.   Maybe you were meant to be there at that moment.  Respect and love
Insane how some people on twitter thought Schaub was making this whole thing up
THIS... is why Rogan and Callen fucks with Shaub. Dude is ride or die as fuck. Props Brendan!! Makin us all eat 7 years of our own shit talk lol
Noone knows who ya r
Brendan's publicist deserves a medal for organising the accident.
That one part was funny
Set them up an IRA with contributions… make sure the Aunt knows to contact social security etc.  Pay for legal counsel and counseling… I imagine there are tons that will do it “pro Bono”.  Get Rogan and UFC involved too! They have the denero 😉🤨
MAJOR props to Schaub. 🙏🙏🙏
He probably drove them off the road like he threatened to do to Bobby lee
Brave man BS, feel awful for those boys, kids had a guardian angel right there.
When you see something like that, nothing really helps you get over it. Just time.
Louis j Gomez basically told the same story on the most recent skanks??
"We're all gonna go to heaven today" dude I'm sick, what people won't do to each other. Jesus fucking Christ
So much respect for Big Brown. It takes special people to stop and help. I had tears in my eyes listening to him recount this story. Mad props Brenden
Oh man Brendan, thank god you were there to help, but I'm so sorry you were the one who had to be there. Listening to the emotion as you're telling this had me in tears the whole time picturing this was my wife and kids (in an accident, not on purpose)  You are a hero
Anyone who claims fake, you got sources?
You're a hero Brendan, you did what 99.9% of people would not have done.  Glad you and family are safe.
You the man Brendan. Much respect brotha.🤞🏼
Major respect
Such a tragedy but what great way to use a platform like this podcast. I've been through something similar to this, it really hits home.
Damn honestly I can't believe people would say he is lying about this. Smh you people need fucking help.
To all that disliked this video;  You are FUBAR
so your telling me Brendan copied Luis J Gomez's story? wow
Jon Jones would have legit thrown a match on the gas
Hero.
What kind of an idiot dislikes this video?
The heart on Brendan is incredible
Similar thing happened to me it changes you….
The dad drove into traffic because he couldn’t turn off the Shaub special playing on the radio
Brendan’s most viral and reputation-saving moment, and he’s wearing a logo that the team itself ran away from 2 years ago 🤦‍♂️ 😅
I suggest a Mental health foundation. I suffer from it and I guess the guy did too. Create a foundation in her name. Oh an well doner. You did what ya heart said. Fegsx
aight Brenda, you get a pass for this one. all love.
ppl give this guy a lot of shit, and i get it we all poke fun, but i always been a fan and this shows hes not just another LA douche. good on you bro !
You know, I'm really not a fan of Brenda Schaub, but he gained my respect after this
Good job brendan.
Why does he point out who is out of shape in his story?  Jokes aside, good on Brendan.  Hes a good dude.
Lol this poor guy gets abused  in the comment section. He gets no respect as a fighter, a comedian, OR a hero! He can do nothing right! LMAOO  That’s a bad ass Cleveland hat though
People think brendans stupidity means he’s. a bad person, not allot of moral people these days. shout out for the doing the right thing u big dummy lol
The mom was beautiful.. how did she end up with an overweight suicidal maniac?
Gas???
Brendan I love you man! You are a fucking outstanding man. Keep on doing what you do bro!
Brandon “the compulsive liar and exaggerator” Schwab
And let’s not forget the trauma the truck driver has to go through... sad situation
A true legend, the world is so focused on looking back retroactively at individuals and calling them hero’s. Brendan is a hero in the here and now so much admiration and respect for this man.   I wish the best for the kids and family involved, awful situation to learn about.
So fucked up! Wishing you a good night’s sleep Brendan ❤️
This is why I get scared when my mom talks about how she can't wait to meet Jesus soon
Good job big bro,  this is what cops are seeing all the time
Honestly most redeeming thing that Brendan could have done. I was never a Schuab hater, but my respect for him 📈
Remember when Khamzat bought food for a homeless man...his boy filmed it and posted it without his knowledge and Khamzat was upset?... Shaub, on the other hand, couldnt wait to drop that detailed play-by-play on twitter. I bet he wishes someone filmed it.
Ur the man and a true hero. And Fu I didnt want to cry today
Made me cry that a person would do that to their own family, Schaub is a hero.
I briefly met Schaub one time and the dude was really nice and respectful to me, he didn't have to be, he could have ignored me and walked away but he was nice enough to stop shake my hand and ask me, a grown ass man, how my day was going. I'll never forget that. Real proud of you, Brandon get some therapy and stick with it, best wishes to the kids and their family and you too Schaub. The fundraiser is closed.
Was a hater. Now my idol
Ders da breeze everywheh
Heard it both ways B
Holy fuck. Hopefully he doesn’t develop PTSD from this, I’m glad that he was there and he was able to think about the kids in that way while all of this was going down. What a hero man.
Unbelievable. . . thank you, Brendan! You were a hero for them.
Don’t mean to detract, but wtf is chb
I know you’re not religious Brendon… but I just wanted to say God Bless you my friend… you are an Angel to those kids buddy… and God Bless the kids you helped save …
😭😭😭😭😭 I had a very similar experience minus the Murder! Man I’m so sorry. Grateful you are able to help those kids in the long run. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
You are Captain America 🇺🇸
Damn, I almost started crying too.
Luis just gomez will crush you in a fight shaub... skanks owned you.
Nobody can watch this without crying.
So glad you stopped! In my country we are obliged by law to stop for any car that may be in distress, yet some people still just drive by. You did something great!
Much respect my guy
Heroic af
This should shut up all those brendan schaub haters.
How tf this got over 200 dislikes
Go Tribe
Here after the most recent episode of the josh potter show (one of the best yet) where he talks honorably about Schaub! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKeUYgqrTmY
❤Rip to the mother of those kids. I hope her memory will always be a blessing for them and that their healing is swift. Sending so much love to everyone involved in this, and so much gratitude to Brendan for being so brave, strong minded, and resilient in that moment. Fuck, that's tragic.
I’ll never talk smack at Brendan again man holy shit
Mr Schaub thank you for stopping. You are stand up dude. What you witnessed i hope does not stay with you to long. But don't be afraid to get help if you need to. I did after 25 years. Don't be a dumb ass like me. Two bad things stayed with me for years peace.
That hat hard AF
Imagine being Made at yourself for helping save people . Weird.
It was meant to be that Brendon was there. As a father that's a hard story to listen to.
Schaub is a good man.
Jesus I'm still crying😢😢 the father needs the firing squad😠😠
💔
Respect
Whoa this is just like that story Luis J. Gomez told on L.O.S.
Hero
Amazing job Brendan
Damn got me ballin my eyes out right now
Hero
Things got real
Champion 💯
Love how he threw his wife under the bus for not wanting to stop 😂
Schaub is nothing short of a hero. Those father instincts took over and he saved lives. And I desperately hope this doesn't haunt him. He doesn't deserve to suffer for a second because of this. But I know he will, and I just pray that it passes quickly
You we're put there for a reason. You did good on that
Legendary shit man. Fuck.
Brendan way to stand up and be a hero when those kids needed one the most!
I broke down Brendan. Man, that is intense. I am so glad that you went out of your way to help those kids. God bless you !
What an amazing human being. The whole time he's trying to save everyone else. Totally selfless.
This is so incredible sad. It fills me with rage with what happened. Well done Brendan 👏 much respect
Anybody that hates on Schaub is just a shitty human.. Dude is as stand up as they come. He did when very few people would have done.  Salute to Brendan
Brendan God bless you bro.
Bro you can help the kids out quite a bit. My dad left when I was 15 years old and it fucked me up for a long time.. You doing what you did  you you will be in those kids alive one way or another for a very long time.
Dude is an actual legend.
This is heartbreaking
Take that goofy racist hat off
Luis J Gomez has a better story
Damn that's a crazy story, life is fucking nuts.
Damn, Hero moment! Good on you for stepping in. So many people nowadays are content with watching or moving on.
God Bless Brendan Schaub
heartbreaking
'It's a kid. She said just keep going' . I understand not wanting the father of your children putting themselves in danger for some strangers kids but I still feel like this makes her a bad human
Did he just refer to the pch as chp
People who even doubt this story and went online to write about their doubt should go do the milk crate challenge and fall on their heads.
I didnt know this podcast still existed until I saw Brendan in the news. Good job Brendan! The only thing funny about this podcast was D'elia... remember him.
Ughh, cannot be unseen. Good Job Brendan, you did the right thing!!!
Gomez on LOS taking shots on latest episode?
Brendan is a Good Man. End of story.
Man hard to listen to.. Schaub is the man!!!!
True warrior Schaub  👏 💯
Does Schaub have a Panther head with Eagle Wings tattoo?!?!?!
I definitely respect schuab after this...Your A good Man!
Welcome to my life lol seeing that stuff in Afghanistan I still close my eyes and see bodies . Then seeing those things you close your eyes to sleep finally then see your kids the way you seen those body’s
Hey Brendan thanks man. Since you did your part I'll do mine and donate what I can. Please do those boys a solid and don't denigrate what you did that day.  Take credit because whether or not anyone would have done the same.  They didn't and you did.  For real man your a hero. 💪👍
Schaub i hope you read this comment. been watching you since your UFC show on Tv days. Were around the same age. Ive been through quite an ordeal myself. Understand something, god - whatever form/shape etc it is in - put you in that place on that day and that time. You were meant to be there because god knows you were one of the few who could handle it. Your brain and your heart combined was the only way you were able to do what you did in that situation for those kids. Take it easy.
You are a hero in my book
You did good Brendan. Those kids would have been dead without you.
I'm not American, but it's the second time that I heard a famous guy from Colorado get out of his way to help other people in extreme situations. Brian Shaw, one of the World strongest man, had a similar story a few years ago. If one day I go to america I want to meet Colorado, just because of these two heroes.
Im glad Brendan didnt know the dads crime - I am afraid of what he would have done to that horrible person - his focus was on the family which saved those kids lives - rest in peace to the mother - brendan is freaking hero
Brendan you are the man
i have always liked brenden what a wonderful person
Brendan Schaub is the fucking man. What a guy. His wife and kids should be proud of him. He’s not Captain America. Hes way better. He’s a real life super hero. God bless you Brendan.
oh god !
Brendan is a fucking king
OK Brendan, you get a pass from now on. Respect.
Much respect for Brendan. People run away from danger. But it takes a real special person to run toward it.
Sad, crazy story - good man Schaub, you were there for a reason 👏🏽🙏🏽
Damn Brandon. Mad fucking respect.
This is my first time to see this  and with all do respect to you Brendan... Good job and thank you for thinking about the kids🙏
Brendan, I'm sorry you gotta live with this image and praying for those kids
Please get back to us about the kids I hope they don't get split up
Hero
Ain't a father that just watched your tell your story big brandon shaub that didn't have a tear or 2 in there eye mate 🙏🙏
Can ANYONE say Brendon is NOT a role model. Well done Brendon..well done indeed. On a side note, get a touch of counseling yourself. If that event just keeps replaying over and over in your mind, please reach out to a professional.
Wow, this made tear up a little bit
Well done Schaub, you 100% did the right thing.
This shit made me angry and sad. Let’s all help those kids
Craaazy😳
How do you dislike this? I just don’t understand, must be bots
Is it me, or has brendan had a shit year ever since d'elia? What a horrific story, and what a tragedy for those kids man.
I cried to this
Anyone else alergies actin up
Brendan you may not be funny but you are a fucking legend bro.
Good on you man. This is what makes the world go around right here
Is this a true story? I saw in a few places he didn't really help?
Hero
Thank you Schaub, I look at you in a completely different light. God bless those kids and may their mother rest in absolute peace.
Schaub is a hero.
Holy shit Brendan, good for you. The world needs more people like this. Good on you.
Watching this made me cry more than watching Brendan's stand up.
If ever there was a time that it was justified for Shaub to cry during a story it was this one.
Holly molly i heard about this story, but hearing it from Brendan him self, i started tearing up. Bro you have my up most respect and love
God bless you Brendan, the world needs more people like you
He will have the scene in the back of his mind the rest of his life. Brendan you’re a good man.
70k raised!!  I wanted to donate and help out a little bit donations are closed :(
Well Schaub has at least mild PTSD now... The way his demeanor changed when talking about the mom tells you how much of a mental image is stuck with him. (I know from experience... That part felt way to real.)
I cried like hell man.
B-Don, you Angel
Oh man, was legit in tears watching this. As much as we like to slag off podcasts and other nonsense petty stuff, fair play to Brendan, genuine hero.
Respect Brendan and all the love for your act of heroism.
Damn man that's what we are supposed to do its dangerous but you cant just drive by when it involves kids you would never be able to live with yourself...
Respect
Amazing act of selflessness. Well done Brendan.
Crazy story. And F that guy.
This straight up made me change my opinion of Brendan forever.
Hope that piss of shit got caught
Who dude 👀 your a hero, sending love from Holland
Much respect, you were at the right place at the right time. God bless 🙏
Devastating. I wish those kids all the best for their future. Side note, it's important to involve people in your story and be respectful, I know Brendan is emotional here, but keep eye contact with others in the room, not just one person.
Dude you're a fucking hero
He finally has something interesting to add
so nobody is going to say that this seems like bs?
Anyone here from LOS?
I gain mad respect for Schaub
Ask Dana to chip in
For someone to do that is so amazingly courageous most people wouldn’t understand, myself included. Brendan is a true warrior in and out of the cage.
It is really hard to throw any kind of shade towards Brendan. I really disliked the guy but holy shit my guy just completely change my perspective on him.
Brandon almost gets stabbed, now this? Jesus. Guy is living a movie. Brandon is good shit.
Mad respect Brendan well done bro x
God said, those children of mine still have time of this Earth before Heaven, and sent an angel to protect them.    God bless you Brendan.  🙏
Not many people would of jumped into help, risking their own life’s in that situation and saving innocent lives. Proper hero, up most respect 🙏🏽
Dope man, i teared up listening to you getting choked up. I saw my brother die in front of me, i know how hard it is to play that over in your head, the tricky part is, you can’t un see it and it’s just a replay in your head everyday
Good job Brendan
Good work B.
That’s beautiful that out of something so tragic,   Kindness can find a way.
Brendan that was an absolutely selfless act and you sir are an amazing person. I hope those kids can get through this and they finally get away from that bag of shit father.
It IS completely different when you see things like this in person, it will change your life forever. I drove trucks for almost 6 years and one time witnessed an SUV a bit ahead of me blow a tire or something and lost control, it went off road then started flipping over and over, as illegal as it was I HAD to try and help. Pulled my rig completely off the pavement off the shoulder, got out and a lady was calling 911 so I ran to the SUV and it was hard seeing this mangled man in the seat, blood everywhere, had landed right side up but the roof was crushed in on him, there's no fires or anything so I decided I would talk to him until paramedics arrived because moving him I was worried I would injure him more and jaws of life were definitely necessary, he kept asking about his wife but was alone in there, I kept telling him she was ok and he was alone in the crash, I didn't know she was thrown from the vehicle when it started flipping and others were helping her about 200 ft behind us, when medics were 20 feet away I stepped back and told them what I saw as they rushed to him, so with about 6 people running to him I stepped away to let them work, later found out he never spoke with them and was unresponsive. I was last person this man ever spoke to, I didn't say a word to anyone for about 2 weeks after that, it definitely changed me forever.
If you didn't tear up then you're a fuckin monster. 😢 I'm a dad too.
Doesn't match with the police or the fire department.  Nice selfie though Brendan.
lol why is brendan calling the kid begging for his life out of shape he could've left that out you know that kids gonna watch this
Brendan you are a real MAN!!!! You get the MVP!!!!
I wonder how much of this is true.
Class act mr. Schuab well done 👍 sir
I found this video because I really like Brendan's take on stuff. I like him more now.
I can't get over how his wife wanted him to keep driving and then was like lowkey mad at him for going over and helping. I get being worried about your significant other, but damn man, I don't think i could've just drove off. Respect to him, he is a hero and I'll never say another negative thing about him.
Respect.
Wow, shoutout  &  Respect to Brendan!!  I saw this on the news as it happened...  didn't know he was first on scene or anything like that.,  Shows what kinda heart he has, stopped to help those kids & is still worried about there well being not just now but long term . ..👏👏👏
God bless u Brendan and I hope ur ok bro.
Wow why is anyone throwing Brendan a negative comment. Shame on you if u have. If u have you’re just as much as a dick as the loser who caused this terrible accident!
Bro, say what you will about Brendan but disaster brings out the true colors inside of someone, Brendan is a hero. These 4 kids now have a chance at life. Fucking incredible and extremely sad story.   Brendan, I hope you can talk to someone about what you saw and lift the burden you're carrying. You saved 4 lives and the Dad is going to get what he deserves, there is far more good in the situation than bad. Keep your head up bro.
Who would dislike this video only ppl I can think of are heartless petty pieces of shit god bless u brenden ur a good dude
"I'm not like ...Caption America or anything"... well, actually...
This guy is a straight fool. Brandon what does having to do with being a out of shape Mexican add to the story. Like if he was in good shape this wouldn’t happen. This guy is a fool
I never wanna see a human's head blown open.... I couldn't sleep properly for a couple weeks.... Never again. I'm not making that mistake again. I know we are capable of a lot but I don't want to grow desensitized to death... My dumbass growing up thought it would make me stronger. Nope. Not worth it.  So sorry he had to see all that... I feel for them. I never really had a dad and lost my mom a few weeks ago... All I do is try to stay graceful that I got to say goodbye.
Holy fuck bro….so sad
Good friend Bryan being an ear for Brendan 👍
Wow, thoughts go out to Brendan. What a terrible thing to happen.
Getting more & more mileage out of this clip
Can someone.. either you Brenden or Eddie or the Gracie family offer the kids Jui Jitsu lessons to help the kids mentally.?
Big ups to brendan, a real life hero.  hope everyone spares a few dollars to help the kids who had no choice but be in such a traumatic event, i have a 3 year old daughter myself and could not imagine any of this happening to her.
Praying for you and your family, and the family and everyone involved Brendan. You did a great thing and will forever be blessed for it, God doesn’t put anything on us that we can’t handle.
You got a heart of gold dude.. thanks man for doing the right thing.. it was brave
I ducking hate fathers
Imagine all the Firefighters that deal with this on the regular
Wow.
Branden smoke some weed you will sleep bro and not remember your dreams. Soldiers and PTSD. Shit you a hero son!
Not an emotional person but god damn I have some waterworks 😢 1 question tho, why the dislikes?
This video kinda tells me that brendans best trait is being himself and that might be what he’s goofed up with the masses for a while
Geezs too many brutal, negative comments here against Brendan. Lay off! he did a great thing!
Oh man this is heartbreaking.  Way to go Brendan you’re the fucking best.
I used to hate Brendan just because it was the popular thing to do. But after I just started to objectively watch his stuff he’s actually a good guy. I’m not a fan of his content, but that doesn’t mean I have to be a hater. He’s a good guy. Hope he does well.
Those babies..🥺. they were dealt a hell of hand at life and will definitely need that go fund me money.  I pray whom ever is in charge of that go fund me ..... Oh god please don't abuse it!  make sure those kids at least receive therapy, a  damn bank account of any amount of money the can access when there 18 for a fighting chance in this world. 🙏🙏🙏
Respect Brendan. Hero!
If only Brendan had his hands on that deadbeat
A real one
What an insane story.  So heartbreaking.  Thank you for doing the right thing for these kids. You are their saint.
Special place in the heavens for you brother. Good man. Stay safe and kiss your kids.
How does this have any dislikes?? Fucking trolls, man.
Hero shit to run towards danger . I witnessed a flip over in Utah once with an suv , he hit the median and flipped doing 50 mph , car seats flying out of the vehicle . Thank God their were no children in the vehicle . But me and my dad jumped out of the car to rescue the 2 adults . It was the most surreal 7am moment in my life running past mangled car seats to a scene with people with unknown injuries  . Both people were fine
sick situation.... wow.
We are very proud of you Schaub, take care of yourself bud ❤️ you my friend are BRAVE
Take that disrespectful hat off
God bless this man , honestly you are a true HERE. #CNN this are stories you guys have to cover.  God bless you Brendan again again again I feel your pain god will help you erase those images you witness. 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
his girlfriend said just keep going? tf is wrong with that b
Respect to you brother💪🏽💯
You did the right thing bro.  Thank you.
I will continue to clown the man but I will clown him knowing he is a fuckin hero.
Man... we take so much life for granted
Hats off to you Brendan
Man this is a terrible story.
This is some serious man shit.
I'm not a fan of Brendan, never been. But this was a truly selfless and heroic act. Respect!
whats with the indians hat/pin? not feeling the guardians?😂
Schaub 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Huge atta boy Schaub. I wish everyone could be counted on like you. Stud.
I both respect him and now pity him as his woman sounds like a real fucking prize.
Jesus, this is horrific. That little boy asking for his mamma got me big time. Massive respect to Brendan. I just hope them kids can go on and live a good life after experiencing such a terrible tragedy.
Just hearing him choke up go me tearing up
Jesus christ you saved not only there lives potentially, you also saved that baby from being even more traumatized, kudos.
A stoic man wouldnt produce this content. He already told this to his bros before the podcast. Yes he did a good thing but is squeezing it for the pathetic attentionhe craves.
ive always looked up to Schuab. bless him and my condolences go to the family
God bless you brother! 👌🏽
Brendan god bless you man u have  good hart!
God bless you Schaub
He wants praise for doing something anybody should do.
Brendan Shaub you are gonna get blessed'.....🙏
I’ve never seen this channel before but the story shook me to the core. I was in a very similar situation with a multi car accident caused by a semi who didn’t slow down and rammed into a line of cars. 2 were deceased, but there was one car that was so mangled and the few people including myself went to go help, and this lady was breathing in such a way that she was gasping. I was talking to her and I told her she would be okay, I stayed until paramedics came but she ended up passing away. It is something that haunts me everyday and just makes you realize how careful and aware you have to be at all times in a car. I will never drive in front of a semi again.
When things like this happen in real life it matters how you react and what you do
You’re a hero, Brendan. God bless you.
it takes a ton of courage and selflessness to run towards the scene of an accident like that
Adopt those kids !!
Went to the full episode to check out the GoFundMe...🥺It’s at $70K!!! But donations have ended so I’m guessing if anyone would like to help, check their (Brendans, Bryans etc) socials incase they’ve mentioned steps being made. We bow to you Brendan. We’re so proud of you. And the kids will never forget the GOOD man/men that helped them. You were put there in that exact moment for a reason. Again...Thank You, Brendan! 🥰💞❤️🙌
Shuab God bless you .... And that brave little kid so baddass
👏👏👏👏👊
Brendan my opinion of you changed! You did a great thing by helping those kids! God Bless you! 🙏
If this don’t bring a tear to your eye!!! Man Brendan you’re a real hero in more ways than one here you handled the situation perfectly!!
This is... Fucked up... B. 's a good man for sure.. We can tell there is a real trauma there.. just his voice man..and the kids for fuck sake... poor youths.
what a poweful story. wow.
👍
Brandon is hero
One day those kids will praise you Brendan. You sacrificed a bit of your conscious to mend a part of theirs. You’re a hero dude.
Aw shit Brenden is a Hero ! Solid one dude!
Tmz is actually creidible and they did cover this.
I don’t believe this is fake and I want to believe this is true. If it’s not a true story somebody provide some evidence
always loves schaub.  i don’t want to see anymore hate on him. You clowns can find another podcast if you want to hate. Hope you recover B.  prayers
Roll damn tribe Brendan Schauab
Fyi the gofundme is up to 70k
Just saw this and want to donate but the go fund me is close:(
What happened to the dad? Was he found?
I'm here because of you Brendan. Angels do exist in real life !
Damn it, who's f*cking cutting onions...
I see that the older brother of the woman who passed away had also started a gofundme. Hopefully no cherry picking is taking place. :(
Damn man. Car accidents are nuts. Please be safe everyone, just another second of thought on the road could save your life and others.
I went through a very very similar situation of helping out on a car accident. Watch it a million times on video but real life changes your life
He could t just dial 911?
Brendan….. I’ve been in the same situation. It’s horrible but you did the right thing. You’ll never forget what you saw, but you’ll always be remembered for what you did. You did right and that’s all that matters. You’re a good man. Don’t forget that.
So as much as people clown him Brendan is tougher than 99 percent of people, stronger etc and to see how tough this was for him like wow. I can’t even imagine being in that position. My dad raised me that like if things go south you run to help people before you run away and because of that I’ve seen some nasty shit but this would have wrecked me mentally.
Why does it cost $30,000 to bury a body? That’s the average YEARLY income for most American families. Like wtf
Life changer for B. Schaub.  Never know when you’re gonna be tested in real life shit.
So much respect for Brendan that is a terrifying story. Thank you for being there
This dude looks like such a big tough guy when he started crying I absolutely lost it nothing like watching a big tough guy crumble
Schaub is a laughing stock in this community but dude this is some avengers shit. Good job man
Just listening to this story almost made me sob. Thank you Brendan for your efforts and incredibly heroic actions. That man can't be called their father, scum doesn't deserve that title
Damn that’s tough man. It takes a lot of courage to get out of you vehicle and help people in an accident. The fear of what you might see is tough. Hope those kids have loving family members to watch and care for them. Peace be with you.
He is the type of person kids should look up to a aspire to be.  Not some of these athletes.
What he did was good, but all the capitalizing on it is a little gross. I'm getting Alan Jackson "where were you" vibes
As a former EMS, your bravery is outstanding! Your career as a fighter, makes your senses keen….probably more than the average human and most EMS personnel. The good samaritan law protects you. God chose you….embrace it!
How the hell did this get a thumbs down from anyone…
Oh ffs. Good job man.
That man is a demon who bared kids
I’ve said a lot of shitty things about Brendan Schuab over the years. Never again. He could shit the bed the rest of his career and I’ll support regardless. What he did was so amazing. Hope for those kids to have a great life. I can’t imagine their situation
um sorry brendan for ever talking shit about you. true Hero
An education fund.. after 2020 Brian is still spewing this nonsense? Good job Brendan. Now teach Brian how to be a man
I’m legit tearing up
Legend man. Absolute Legend. Running towards a leaking rig getting gasoline on you while having the knowledge in the back of your head that a mere instant can change the situation, you saved lives. Absolute legend. My best wishes towards those kids going forward.
Respect to Brendon.
Love him or hate him, you can't deny Brendan of his bravery and courage.
I’ve ran on the 101 freeway in Ventura outside the mall. An SUV flipped and was on its side. I got out and ran and was jumping into the SUV when someone yelled everyone had been removed from the car. I ran back to my car and drove off so I wouldn’t be late to work.
I have an image in my head of a bicyclist laying on the road with his brain matter out, this was when I was around 4 years old. Images like that haunt you for a long long time. R.I.P to the kids mother.
Brendan your a real hero.
I remember a similar experience where me and my dad pulled a lady through the windshield of a car after a bad accident, her husband was dead in the passenger seat and she was asking for him. It’s traumatic for sure. I can’t imagine trying to hide the mom from the kids though. Brutal stuff. Hope He understands that he did amazing stuff by thinking all that in the moment. You’re a hero Brendan.
Good shit Brendan, fuckin sad man
Jeez Schaub....nothing but respect to you here. You need to make sure your head is right also, that is some traumatic shit to witness.
this actually made me cry a little holy fuck
Drain that freaking ear.
This is a message to any women or mothers in abusive relationships. Dont stick around one more second for your sake or your kids sake gtfo
Schaub buddy, based on this it sounds like you might have PTSD.  Not sure how you're doing now but if you're still seeing that mother and not sleeping please get some professional help. And it goes without saying, good job brother.
I couldn’t donate anymore. Jeeze, praying for those kids now. And also that evil dad. I wish I could donate but the thing was expired. This was so upsetting. Great job brendan.
Damn what a story man.
I’m not crying.. you’re crying
The GoFundMe is no longer accepting donations, nice job 👍
God bless you....and those poor kids...
Didn't Brian Rape a chick? No shame in his game.
That dad is a POS. How could you man
This is so fucking sad. Brendan did well in that situation but you can tell how it's affected him. He could probably do with some therapy/councilling himself. 🙏
Whoever designs these studios needs to be fired!
All jokes aside Brendan is a hero!
That “father” is going to clean himself up…start another family and do the same thing. Women fall for trash can dudes like that all the time…sadly.
As much as I trash Brendan for his comedy this was a pretty amazing thing to do. He still has no business doing stand up but he's a real hero for this.
Thats sad. you can hear in Schaub's voice ..
Wow, that’s a lot to take in. Hope Brandon’s okay.
Is Callen back?
thanks Brendan for making a difference
Absolutely horrific...  you are a quality human Brendan - hope you are OK.
Bro.... All Heroes dont wear capes. Well done.
This is probably the most honest that he’s ever been about any story in his life.
God put you in the right spot for that moment.
well done Schauby
Brendan.. you're a badass in the ring and out of the ring.. those kids are alive because of you.. good job
Such a great guy...you did a great thing ...how life is the dad was supposed  to be the protector  but to them kids in only 1 minute  of their lifes you became the protector.....✊🤝
Thank you Brendan
this was tough to listen to & had me in tears but thank you. Brendan God bless you & your family. tame time off bro & recover from this mentally
imagine seeing Schaub after an accident “oh hey Schaub”
Brendan Schuab, as much as we clown him, is actually a hero for this shit. 🙏🏼
Brendan will forever be changed , never be the same after something like this. and those kids man.. fuck
those kids lost there mother :(
all the hate this man has received for what? when shit like this shows he's not a bad human, ppl really suck man
This would fuck anyone up having to go through some shit like that.
Good job man.
Out of shape people and his wife told him to "keep going" even when he tells an important story he's still a duche bag lmao
I don't fuck with Brendan much, but this story is nuts. Good dude.
Wow. This story touched my heart. Amazing.  Thank you Brendan
Hope all you Shaub haters feel some remorse... what an amazing human being, shame on you guys
You’re a hero B
God bless
Who will save us from his comedy specials?  🤔🤔🤔
He's gonna get his ass whooped
Life is fucked
Please someone tell me the father is gonna rot in prison !!
wait. the fighter and the kid is back?? :D
Shout out to Brendan and to all of those out there that would do the same. As a father, a child crying out for his momma is the most natural and essential thing they can do. The fact that she was no longer there for him and his brothers was heartbreaking.
I honestly never liked Schaub. But after this, I have nothing bad to say. He could have kept driving.....he didn't.
You were chosen to be at that place at that particular time.  Don't for one minute ever doubt or question that.  You were chosen by something greater than us, to show up for those kids.
I cried…
FYI The GoFundMe is not accepting donations anymore. It's at 70k and has some kind of message for the organizer to sign in for more details. I bet they can get a lot more if they open it back up.
Great job Brendan! We are all proud of you 👏🏻
Legend.
Who are the 243 poor lost souls that gave this story/video a thumbs down?... I just really dont understand it man. There really are just some complete waste of space and heartless assholes in this world. No joke.
My respect for Schaub 📈📈📈
Spreading love
You can say what you want about Schaub's UFC record but what you can't argue is that when it comes to fight or flight...he still and always will have that fight in him. God bless you Brendan. That was a selfless and heroic act. Cheers to you brother.
how did the mexican dude get away clean?
Damn...brendan is a legend for this and even trying to talk about it..respect mate respect
legit made up.  you fan boyz kneel down and say yes daddy I will swallow
Fking sad as fk
I know you and I don't see eye to eye on things.,..... whatever.....I wish you were there for all accidents like this. I couldn't have done that. I don't think I could...I don't know....thank you for saving them.
Wow. Props to Schaub.
Brenden gets a lot of shit but deep down he's a really good man in my eyes.
He has cleaned his plate of all the hate he got.
Go fund me doesn't have to be much but some helps
Not many stories make me just wanna cry but this one hit a little different , more then respect for you brother
Nobody ever questioned if he was a good guy... he's just about as funny as a dead soldier ... yeah great guy still sucks as a comedian
car accidents are horrible
“ the windows broke . I’m not fucking captain America “ 😂 why that comment had me dead
Thank God for people like Brendan
Fucking hell this is hard to watch. Respect brandan. I’ve poked fun at you before but I will never again. This is tough. This would be so tough for the kids. God bless brandan
Bryan shut up for once. God my man needs to sit back and listen sometimes
man this is heart breaking ... well done for doing all you could Brendan. No words...
Fucking hero man
Ahhh man shaub your a hero bro! You cop alot of shite as a public figure but as a man you've always seemed like a decent bloke to me, but this story just shows your a hero man, much love from Australia
Am I the only one who laughed (while simultaneously sitting her in tears  .. c'mon... I'm not a monster!) Then sat here wondering wtf is wrong with me? Not many people could cause such a conflict of emotion but Schaub.... Somehow effortlessly (and seemingly unintentionally since he was definitely choked up, serious and just trying to get through the story) somehow manages it....   And just to be clear ... I was absolutely not laughing at any part of the actual story... But at Schaub's natural disposition and way of story telling... (Ex:the window breaking & not being captain America)
Im in tears watching this right now. God bless you for this brendan.
Some of us knew this about B. Schaub, glad everyone knows now!!!
You're the man Brandon! God bless
Everyone should be grateful of people like
Thank you Brendan
👏👏👏👏 well done Mr Schaub...
Is this recent? I know it was posted recently
Only time I've seen Brendan Schaub in the title and clicked. I'm glad I did cause I appreciate his kind acts as a human
Much respect schaub, a fucking warrior
A true hero. Tell us more Brendan wow https://youtu.be/fbUc5nsAPTo
https://youtu.be/fbUc5nsAPTo
Good job Schaub.  Hope those kid will be fine at the end.
I putted myself in danger a few times to help complete strangers. And I'm a father of a 14 year old girl. I've talked about it with a therapist friend and she said some people don't have the self preservation "software" in them. They just react by instinct, altruism and concern by their fellow humans well being. Commonly people call these kind of persons "heroes." I don't think about that as something heroic. I think we are just built different than most people.
Brendan gets so much shit. When all his doing is trying to hard around people who suck.  This time it pulled off.  Good man.
Damn that's crazy.... Brendan usually says some goofy shit but this is deep. I hope Brendan gets some counseling as well. Seeing a dead body like that ain't normal and could affect someone bad.
That was heavy Schaub! I’m proud of you bro.
PROPS BRENDAN
Where's the dad
What a lad and what a story teller! Have allways been a fan og Brendan
Hero.
Fight Jake Paul in a celebrity fundraiser!
It’s crazy some people are claiming he faked it or saying  “it’s not a big deal anyone would have done it “, is just beyond crazy. Brendan went out of his way to do something and also help with the GFM, those kids lost their mother from a shitty father. Pray those kids find a way through all of this.
Best part is throwing his wife under the bus saying she was like just drive on after seeing a kid screaming for help! lol
He did the right thing at the right moment so people with a big heart ❤️ will always do the same thing they don’t call heroes they’re call awesome people with and awesome brave hearts 💕 cheers up (I will do the same))
the dude was driving the wrong way ??? in a freeway?  he must be prohibited from driving any CAR ever again
Schaub and Messican have nner plans. Drive by and see a horrific wreck with 4 kids and one of them waiving frantically for help! Messican tell Schaub to KEEP GOING!?!? I MADE A RUDE COMMENT IN THE TFATK SUB AND CAUGHT MY FIRST WeeK BAN..
Any gays watching this? .if so sup?
he has kids so imagine him watching this situation
this is why i never made fun of Schaub, beccause he was a guy who chose to step into the cage and put his body on the line in a fist fight. i'e never disrespect someone who fought in the UFC. FUCKING SHEEP
What idiots dislike this, wtf is wrong with you guys!
Brendans a bad ass! He may end up back in the ufc from this, I just remember rogan ripping him on the show it was savage!!!
Nothing but respect
Crazy I seen this accident on the news
Love ya man ! Good job!
Brendan I have no words, 06:30 in the UK crying hearing this story, Soo much respect for you.
GANG!!!!
Angels come in all forms. I salute you Brandon.
Man.. may God bless these kids. Shout out to Brendan. Powerful, moving story and reminder of what really matters in life..
I hope Brendan keeps on top of his mental health after this. A horrific scene like this and the PTSD that could follow. His mates have gotta check up on him down the track.
Such a Big Heart❤ God bless you Brenden🙏
When did he get on the jucie? Branden looking yoked
Always thought you were a legend, you just stamped it into history. God bless you man. Honestly. You’re a badass. Instead of crying, smile. You done what you can man and you should be proud ❤️
God damn bro i hope that man has a horrible life for what he did to that woman. Those kids deserve the best life man R.I.P Aimee
Respect brendan.
If Joe picky as fuck likes this guy. I got a minute for em.
Just wanna scream in his ear
Great job this is a man when it matters.
Sad
It has always been fun to troll Schaub - but he's a hero. A real one
Glad you're ok Brendan. All the best.
Holy crap
Brian is right when he said you did the right thing!! Those kids are so lucky you reacted  the way you did, you were there guardian angel and will be bound to those kids forever
Bryan's expressions while Brendan is reading are priceless!😂😂
Brendan’s wife told him to just keep going instead of helping?? Cool..
Respect to Schaub!
those kids need mentoring, get them in a gym. Hats off to Brendan. Solid dude.
Damn. I hope Brendan can make it thru in a swift manner. This sort of thing can really make life difficult to endure. My man has a good head on his shoulders. Be strong and fill ur life with peace and love. 🙏✌️
Brendan is a beautiful man
Cheers to all the heros like Brendan.
We all fuck with brendan but we have to admit the man has balls and he is a actual good guy.
Nothing but respect Branden!
Man of the Year: Brendan Schaub ❤️😭💪🏻
Jesus christ Brendan. Love you dude.
Brendan needs to keep talking about his experience it will help in the long run
Brandon GF correct never stop he was lucky his GF didn't get hurt people don't stop
If you seen the photo of the accident.. a collision of  gas truck  on anything is a no no for any untrained search and rescue civilian. Brendan risk his life for this. Salute
god bless you Brennan you did the right thing
Saw my mom like this. Haven’t stopped drinking since.
I used to make fun of you dude but this act of yours has touched my heart. You are an amazing human being, Respect!!
Wow..
I guess knowing that you did all you could to help would be the only way to battle the trauma. Respect the heaviness of this situation.
As if Brendan could act this good. 💯facts
Don’t like to use the word hero but there is no other word 👊❤️
I've hated brendan for a long time but fuck man I feel terrible now for what he saw this guy is a hero
That's some real hero-level action.
This video has boosted that gofund me to more then double what they were asking for!!! I hope he finds peace knowing how much he can help this family stay together! What a great man!
How long has Bryan been back
I’ll admit it, I talk a lot of shit about schaub but mad respect for doing that 👍🏽
I was in a similar situation. Much respect to you Brendan. It took me a while while to get my head right afterwards, but time does heal all. Just remember it's a small price to pay for the lives of those kids.
Wasn't this guy bryan metooed? What happened with that?
If you don't believe that the universe/God puts people in certain places at certain times, then this situation will change your mind. Brendan you are an amazing human.
Deleting this app. Can’t believe they allow Bryan on here. He sexually harassed woman
God bless you Brendan Schaub
Seeing something like that is really traumatising, sorry you had to see that but thankful you were there for those kids
You're a hero. God Bless you and protect those kids moving forward and provide them with all they need and heal their body, souls and minds and may God heal your spirit from the trauma.
I'll be honest and say I thought Brendan was a bit of douche.. NOT NO MORE BRO...NOT NO MORE.. RESPECT BRENDAN
Damn i feel for shaub and those kids
For as much as I have dogged on you for being Joe Rogan's shadow... Much respect Schaub. That's one hell of a good deed man.
I genuinely always liked Brendan but my respect for him has just gone through the roof. And as a fire fighter in the uk, you see some truly horrible things when you turn up to road traffic collisions, so respect my man ✊
Mad respect brother.
id divorce my wife if she said "keep driving" after seeing a child screaming for help. shame on her.
Hi guys, can y’all please get rid of Chappell. Bring it back to just you and callen. It’s too many people talking at once plus he just laughs really loud and interrupts a lot.
His chick is so typical fake online persona  she wanted to keep going and she's the one posting about being heroes on her social media  barf
never ever knew why people hated on big brown, hes such as nice guy. hopefully they see him for the good guy he is.
Why raise money? If it’s this close to home man bust out your personal check book you’re not broke.(when it comes to the kids)
Today made 4 Month's 1 of my Best friend was killed in a Car Accident, be careful everyone stay safe drive safe
Definitely can’t call himself a comedian. But he sure as hell can call himself a hero
It raised over $70 Gs. They stopped accepting donations.
S/O to the medics & fire boys doing this without a podcast.   Good on Brendan. Saved multiple lives. The nightmares will fade brother.
god put you there son, god bless you and your family.
God bless you Shaub you were there for a reason
well fair play hes earned my respect, he has a new fan
Mad respect to Brendan just to have that instinct to put those kids before himself✊✊ God bless
Having experienced two similar incidents like this, I really feel for Brandon. If you've never seen someone severely mangled, the images are like a permanent marker on your brain for a few weeks, or longer, depending on how well you knew those involved. RIP to that poor woman and condolences to her children. No one deserves to to suffer like that.
I know we all give brenden shit, mostly justified. But holy shit bro. You're a hero! I'll never feed into the meme again you've earned a lifelong pass from me.
Heavy Heavy story  Jesus
anyone would do this and not talk about it like a hero!
Brendan is corny.   But he’s a good friend and person I think we can all agree.
I was first on the scene of a fatal car crash when I was 18 or 19. I stopped my car and ran to the lady that was thrown from her vehicle. Without being too graphic, she was already deceased and looked like her face had been removed from skidding across the road. Shortly after that a guy walked across the street to the gas station close to where the accident happened, saw the car that the lady had been in and put everything together. It was his wife. I can see that lady's face and hear that guy's cry to this day, 20 years later. I couldn't sleep for a couple days, and couldn't sleep with the lights off for months for whatever reason. I don't know how first responders do that shit every day. It stays with you.
Brendan your amazing, heavenly job my brother, respect from your brother from Ireland.
I knew I liked B for a reason! Most people keep driving.
Respect
Much respect tho bro
You’re a hero dude. Bless those kids and I hope they stay together and get what they need to make it together ❤️
Good shit Schaub.  Big respect.
Idk who you are but I just clicked this video and I am speechless. I have a 9 yr old and cannot express how much I empathize with your concern for those kids.
Good Guy Brendan
Brendan done what was expected of you in that situation. He’s a good guy but still sucks sometimes and his comedy is cringe but he’s not a guy who has malice in his heart. Everyone needs to realise we joke about his comedy and not about him personally
Like Joey Diaz would say you went at it like a f****** Marine, I literally teared up as soon as the kids started waving at Brandon
Memes aside, respect for Brendan for what he did
always knew he was a good soul....as did most of us.
This great act of bravery just crushed all the little things I found annoying about Brendan.  Also made me realize how stupid I was for focusing on those things. What a man.
I’ve always liked Brendan and this makes me like him even more.
gangsta
Mad respect Brendan. Way to be a great person.
good for being there for them kids man , my heart goes out to them , life is crazy man
Schaub's girl is a bitch, won't stop at this scene with a kid begging for help
Straight up hero. He's still not funny.
Hero
Brendan you should get some counseling yourself after seeing all of that.
Brendan is a hero
You are a hero!..I’m glad you stopped!
Brendan = Hero
WTF
Ok, well I’m all choked up. Completely unexpected!! Fucks sake!!
Off course the bad guy lives, but getting hit on the freeway and walking away?
Wow, Brendon you are a hero mate. I’ll always see you in a different light now.
I’m never hating on Brendan again. 💯
Brendan Schaub is a national treasure
Brendan you’re one special human. I hope you know how much you helped those children. I cried the moment you mentioned the wreck… i couldn’t imagine witnessing this…  and to go as far as helping them, you’re a true hero 🤍
This really changed my prospective on Brendan. Much respect to him.
Diesel. Trucks burn diesel. Amazing job nevertheless
Always been a fan of bee stand up dude
Respect man !!!!!!!
Absolutely enourmous respect and admiration towards Brendan 👏 Ive always liked the guy and have been a fan of the podcast, and its not been hard to tell that he does carry a good heart. My heart goes out to those kids. Not just for the accident but also for what they have probably endured throughout the years. This is such a tragedy but Brendan should be proud of how he handled it and how he has every intention of going a step further by looking after those kids in the ways he mentioned. You are a good man Brendan, god bless your soul and Im sure those kids wont ever forget you for what you have done once they are old enough to understand the situation. It will mean something very deep to those kids. When it comes to accomplishments in life theres not many things that can beat playing the role of someone who has potentially saved lives and becoming (what will hopefully be) a person who can pull someone out of darkness and into the light. That is what you became that day Brendan.
Schaub is a good dude bless him
RESPECT to BRENDAN man... Wow... I'm tearing up over here... god DAMN!
Is that gofundme legit  ?
Wow, I find Brendan Schaub annoying as hell, but it turns out he's a really good person.   Well done to him, truly.
Am I the only person that’s glad to know the dad was hit by a car?
I had a similar thing happen outside my house. Truck hit a car then went into neighbors house, truck and house burnt down. I was first on the scene and found the lady driver dead in her car. Shit fucked me up.
The fighter and the kid diddler, more like it.
🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💯👊🏽
Your a good  Man .
I heard about this story on the news. I had no idea that Brendan was there
Honestly I wasn’t a huge Brandon fan, but after hearing this, love this dude. Heart of gold
God Bless you Brendan Schaub!
Brenden you had me ballin brother. God bless you.
My God Brendan your amazing seriously I know your humble and you could care less about praise but God bless you your an Angel for that family this story gave me the chills  they couldn’t have been rescued by a better Man much respect God bless you and your family 🙏🏼
Brendan Schaub made me cry…
Shaub for president !
What a good story
Glad he was able to help. Thank god he wasn't wearing Gucci Boots and Skinny Jeans...
Imagine being genuinely hated by the YouTube community as I was to him , and then being in the position and also taking that risk to save 3 lives , he may not be a good comedian but hes obviously a damn good person and I'm sure hes going to feel good about himself for a long time for that
Damn Brendan, I know you don’t know me but I’m proud of you bubba. Sorry you had to see that but glad you were there to save these kids lives.
Ive personally come up on 2 accidents with horrific fatalities. It never leaves you. The nightmares & constant visions randomly can be haunting.. if you let it. You did the right thing Brandon 👏
Heroes in real life aren't perfect like in the movies. My dad was a sociopath but I saw him beat the absolute shit out of 3 guys that tried mugging my mom. He did a year and a half in jail for it.
Wow respect brother you are incredible
The gofund me for the funeral is no longer accepting donations. You should make a gofund me for their college tuitions.
G Bless Schaub
Last year my Brother killed my Niece and himself. I’ll never understand why, or what could make someone do that.  This came out of nowhere and happen to come as my Brother was changing medication and I have no doubt it was the medication that did this. But he still put himself in that position.  My Daughter was the same age as my Niece and they were really close.  It’s been horrible. It’s still horrible. And sadly this happens all the time.  My heart goes out to this family and those children.
If you have ever had to pull kids out of a car or a dead kid or anyone for that matter …. It will scar you forever
Brendan is a freaking hero!
Bless you bro the universe put you right where you were supposed to be everything happens for a reason
Good ish
I have kids. This just ripped me up.
I’m not crying you’re crying
Fuck this hits hard.
Well the GFM raised over $70k. That’s some good news. I feel for those babies. Yes, they lived through their dad trying to end their lives and got saved by a hero, but who knows what kind of other stuff they’ve seen or experienced behind closed doors. My heart breaks thinking about it.  You made a great decision shielding them from their mommy in the front of the car. No doubt saved them from even more mental trauma. I hope you continue to be a consistent part of their lives, even if it’s just some video chats here and there. They possibly owe you their lives and you are their guardian angel.  Much love Brendan. Mad respect and I wish you the best in dealing with the after effects this has taken and will take on you as well.
Got kids my self made me cry 😢  just wanna give Brendan a hug looking at him getting all chocked up,brendan you a legend man them kids will remember you as their hero top bloke 👏
Brendan you’re the fukn man
Give it a week before everyone takes the piss out of him again. Respect where its due Brendans the man 😎
3:07 you were that day Brendan. You were that day.
Dam that's insane. Props to Brennan for doing the right thing.
Fuck man, you're a real stand up guy Brendan. Much respect 🙌
Fuckin nightmare man
Wow such a sad story. Brendan my respects bro you did a great thing.
God Bless bro Sometimes you get called to do work. You’re the man Brendan. Keep being a G.
Respect bro. I've been there. It takes a special kinda person to just do what you did.
what would have really killed the entire family is if they sat through one of his comedy specials
I need to know what happened to the father?
Good job Brendan!
I saw 8 dead bodies in the road in my first year of trucking alone.  The term "First Responders" is totally inaccurate.  All I saw were covered by whatever people could find, truckers, cars that pulled over used blankets, clothes anything just like you asked to be done to the mom to shield the kids.     You don't get paid to be a hero. Even if you are paid to, you're still not a hero, you have to choose to be it. Not many others stopped. You did the right thing, and avoided even more serious things.
Hey  Uncle ben   Close those stankey legs
Where’s the GoFundMe and the tears for Callen’s victims????
That’s a mans man
Brendan, I rarely say this, but you're going to Heaven. Our Master has many rooms for you in Paradise.
Respect.. frfr
It took Brendan a woman losing her brains 🧠 to stop being a stuck up, selfish, ungrateful sheep 🐑   Bless the lady 👩 🙏 🙌 ✨ ❤ ♥ 👩 🙏 🙌 ✨ ❤ ♥ 👩 🙏 🙌 ✨ ❤ ♥ 👩 🙏 🙌 ✨ ❤ ♥ 👩 🙏 🙌 ✨ ❤ ♥ 👩 🙏 🙌 ✨ ❤ ♥ 👩 🙏 🙌 ✨ ❤ ♥ 👩 🙏 🙌 ✨ ❤ ♥ 👩
Didn’t wanna cry at 10:35’am but I’m a wreck. Thought about my moms passing and how it fucked up us three. Thanks for being a real dude brother
Brendan officially proved he's a real one
My nigga Brendan pointing out all the out of shape niggaz in da house 🏠
Everyone hates on Brendan but at the end of the day he is a good dude.
Fuck man I hated Brendan and I’m bawling right now fuckkkkk. Respect brother 🤛🏻 😭
Much respect Brendan stay strong buddy
Well done! Tragic ;(
legit teared up watching this. brendan is a hero fr
Respect. Plain and simple. Respect for doing something.
Great story thank you for saving those children Brendan !
Why does every positive comment start with criticism for his haters? Lol just leave that part out, it hurts the overall sincerity of the positive part. Just my opinion
Good for you big Schaub, thanks for being the man those kids needed.    This comment section must be full of comments like this but what else can we do.. Gofundme time  Note: The gofundme page isn't accepting donations anymore, anyone know why? Or where to go to donate more?
I heard the guy tried to kill his family cause they said Schaub was funny
Foo Fighters "My Hero" starts playing....
“You did a great thing bro” now let’s completely forget about this and go back to talking shit.
Brendan so much respect to you men you are a hero bro
and just like that brendan stopped being the joke of the internet and forever the badass he is
Not a bad job. Good man.
That the diffrence in Texas. You are taught to stop and help at any car wreck!
Your are Captain America Brendan
Hey Brendan, one dad to another dude; what you did is what every normal man hopes someone would do if they got hurt/killed. You came to the rescue of the family. In today’s world with all the hate and division acts of humanity/ kindness aren’t the norm, they are the rarity.  Thanks for being a man. For being a dad. Thinking like a dad. Acting like the world around you matters.  I’m sure you’ve been told this but in the longer term you risk developing PTSD yourself; so the sooner you seek counseling the better. You don’t want to save one family but lose yours because you’re torn up inside.  Much love,  Jeff
Amazing those kids will always remember you
Everyone’s super gullible. Go read lafd report same with lapd, the authorities rescued them...
Extraordinary act Brendan. Haters of this man have to go away.
People who kill children should be tortured and executed immediately. Maybe people will think twice before they hurt children.
The fact that his WIFE who has TWO KIDS said keep going doesn’t sit well at all with me… I wouldn’t want to see her put in a situation where her own kids are in danger. Zero maternal instincts. Weird it’s not mentioned at all.
No one can dispute Brendan and his card, those kids will remember his actions for the rest of their lives.
wow...good man Brendan. That was a crazy story. Sad but thankfully kind people like Schaub were there.
Brendan is suddenly the greatest stand up.  True fucking hero.
I have a whole new respect for him.   Brendan you are a good man.
Good man.
He’s calling people out of shape when he is out of shape
This video might have turn me back into a fan. Definitely a rough one to listen to tho.
Respect to brendon for wearing a chief wahoo hat.
This brought tears to my eyes. There are still good people in the crazy world.
Even tho brenden is mad sus and silly half the time he did an amazing thing. Props to him, thoes kids are blessed brenden was around.
This is heartbreaking
Brendan, you a good man. This shit teared me up.
Over 70 thousand! I cant donate! Proud of you Brendan
Nowadays we need more super heroes....good shit
Over $70,000 raised!
Your a legend Brendan. Rest in peace to the mom 🙏🏻
Brendan is a fucking hero.
Goddamn this is hero shit
Legend....ary
No scrapes no marks huh
Your a good human .
Prove it
First time I didn’t hate Brendan. You’re a good guy, you’re a hero bro. Hella respect!
Dam Brendan shaub is a hero, much respect good sir.
That story sounds so familiar 🤔   oh well  •whats up skanks fans😂
Take the kids under your wing and train them. It will help them physically and mentally.
I worked in a wrecking yard.  I have seen the aftermath of fatal accidents.  It is absolutely terrifying.
Changed my day brother my hat off to you . My God my heart breaks for these kids .
Nice job.
Smh such a sad incident all around 🙌🙏 good shit B 💯😎👍💪
Holy shit
😭Respect
The idiots never die.   Shame
I’m sorry for all the shit i have talked about Brendan
Seriously horrible situation Hope the kids get better. Brendan is a great guy and only thing I wish was that crazy dad could’ve went at Brendan because that guy deserves to be hurt for what he did
He stepped up when most would not, running towards danger instead of away takes something most keyboard warriors can’t comprehend. Then to try and help bring more attention to the gofundme and to help the kids further is above and beyond.   People are always bitching that rich people don’t do anything for people or have the means to help but don’t. He didn’t have to do any of this but did all of it. You don’t have to like schaub but you damn well better show the man some fucking respect.
If callen is back then I will start watching it again without him nah
Terrible Tornado Tee I see you 😬
Does the black dood talk?
“That’s a kid”.    Your wife:  “just keep going”. Bro, your wife sucks as a human being.   Jesus. You’re a hero Man.  Thanks for helping the kids.
He is a good man well done Brendan 👏
Brendan is a real hero. The world needs people like him. God bless
Your a good man bud
I will never disrespect this man ever again. He forever will be a hero in my eyes ❤️
that mad me weep.
This is chilling
You did what you had to. The trauma you feel from doing something is minuscule compared to what you would feel had you done nothing. Sometimes heros wear Chief Wahoo caps.
We really need to come to grips with the reality that this country is full of people with untreated mental health issues, and if we don’t get a grip on it, meaning that we as a society should invest in a push to get help to the members of our society that need it, then we’ll continue to be at the mercy of whatever the next psychotic outburst the person next to us is having that day.
Seen that movie, it never leaves you..  Make sure Brendan gets Counseling too.  Put the gofundme on rogan.
As much as people poke fun at Brendan tongue and cheek  (and sometimes rightfully so). He’s a stand up guy deep down, god bless him.
:(
So much respect for this man. I had the honor of meeting him at a show before the pandemic and was a stand up dude. My heart goes out to those kids and hopefully they will get the help they need. Brendan is a good man and always will be.
I would have driven right past. Hope all good things for you Brendan.
Be their big brother. Y’all all went through mental trauma that day together. Work through it together. And it’s obvious they have a piece of shit dad so they need a good male influence in their life. The money will only change life short term, this would help long term. So sorry you had to see that, but thank god you were there.
So what happened with that rape case against Bryan callen?
Bless your heart, Shaub. We’re so fucking proud of you.
I am proud of you Brendan, you did the right thing!!
Cops see things like this all the time to put this into perspective. I know a guy who works for a sheriff's office and responded recently to a fatal car crash with 4 teens in it. Think about these things next time any of you chant defund the police.
God bless you Brendan. You rose to the occasion when someone was in dire need.
So sad man,.   Your a hero.  Bro.   Such a selfless act.  People like yourself. Make this world a better place. God bless you , and the kids who lost there mother,. Losing your mother is the hardest thing in the world to deal. With.  " Miss you mom everyday".    Be safe everyone!
Brandon, you are a hero
Branden amazing 🙏
Good man
What an awkward-ass setup...  Get a fucking desk to sit at/lean on or something.  Get some fucking chairs that let people relax and do something with their arms...  What the fuck is this set?
I can't explain what it feels like to be caught up in a situation like that. It makes you throw everything in your life to the side and only focus on the people in need.
He be on Rogan next week telling same story
He should get this kids into MMA and train them up from young. Imagine future champions, now that will be a hell of a story
Legend  ANYONE EVER WRITES ONE NEGATIVE COMMENT ABOUT BRENDAN EVER AGAIN…
How are there thumbs down on this video? People are fucking horrible man. The anonymity of the internet really brings out the idiots lol.
Didn't do his wife any favors by saying she told him to keep driving lol. Dude is a hero. I know it's fun to fuck around and meme on Brendan but dude is honestly a great human being
How do you monsters dislike this video??
So much respect for Brendan.
You did the right thing! I've been in that kind of situation before and I couldn't just drive by it, I had to stop and help. Those kids are definitely going to need counseling!
Did he have to clarify that it wasn't a funny story? Coming from him, thats a given
He is a solid guy one million percent 💯
This story is fake. Just like his career
Respect
Brendan going on a full press tour to tell literally EVERYONE how he did a good deed. Atta boy! Way to exploit a terrible situation!
Thank you brother
That was not date night,that was a destiny night,in time and in space an act of fate. God bless he who saves a child.
Respect. Good man .
Salute Brendan
Dam man.. this world is getting worse and worse. Brendan I'm not gonna lie bro I really thought you were about that bullshit but man your a good dude. Things happen for a reason no doubt. Dont loose track of those kids bro... 🙏
Brendan gets a good bit of shit but he’s a sweet boy n a good man n he did something heroic. He should be applauded for that
Sounds like bullshit.
Nothing but respect, we all hope we would act in the same way if we saw something like that but often people don’t. Well done Brendan
Respect Brendan
When men are men. Tremendous.
Brandon you did the right think, you were a guardian angel for that family that day!
It's really sad Brendan had to do something like this for people to say nice things about him. This should be a wake up call to haters to actually do something with your life.
Well boys looks like the era of talking shit about Brendan has come to an end.
They just raised over 70k and stopped accepting donations unfortunately
Damn ❤️ much love
Rip to the momma,..ur a hero Brendan
Brenden, you must have looked like an angel to those kids man. You did what was right. Your son will remember this and it will be a defining moment for him and his character.
If Brendan tried saving me, I'd start fighting him..
Way to go B Shaub.  I have been there, but not as horrific an accident, and I did not like it one bit.  Saw some ugly shit.
Respect big Brown. ❤️
They at 70k now raised for the funeral🙏🏼
Heroes are made from moments that are never easy and require sacrifice. God Bless You Brenden, and may God show these children Mercy in processing their difficult and complex trauma.
Jesus man this was hard
“if anyone saves a life, it shall be as though he had saved the lives of all mankind.” - Qur'an
Brandon will probably use this as content in his next stand up comedy special mark my words
Love you bro , thank you for being who you are
You are a Warrior Brendan and a hero.    Everything in our lives is preordained by God and for a purpose.  You were exactly where God intended you to be so you could help save those children.  I pray and hope this causes you to see both sides of humanity, the good and the evil.
Holy moly.  Intensely sad.  :(
Props to you brendan, you saved those kids from a lifetime of trauma, you are a true hero man, take any time you need for your own mental health

Fair play Brendan. Hero
🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👑👑👑👑
Helt hero hero hero. Why u guys talking like... Did Brendan do that isnt he a cant, a puzzy Know it is lives 1 on podcast and 1 on the way home.... CLOVS. Would rather have did this then win 10 UFC BELTS
Fuck man. So much for hating this guy anymore.
God put you in the right place at the right time. Thank you Brendan 🙏
Wow gained some huge amount of respect for Brendan. I can only wish I would be able to do the same thing..
I hate alot .......You are Real..... this got me in tears .......your a hero ...like for real
damn!!!!! youre great
Wow..! I know it’s hard, but try to get some sleep. Micro dozing THC edibles with CBD oil helps me with my PTSD. You’re the man Brendon. PS. You might want to talk to Rogan for advice on PTSD. His podcast was a great help for me.
After hearing this story I will never laugh at another shitty Brandon put down joke again. Huge respect for the guy.
Didn't Brian get canceled?
HERO
You are Captain America Brendan. Thank you for saving those kids and setting an example of good human things to do and importance on being a great father to your kids.
Respect you as a man forever Brendan I have three kids of my own💪
Damn this is the craziest story! I'm halfway through and I'm freaking out!
Hero? Well OK. Perhaps these days we have all lost our humanity, so helping some kids out of a crashed car is heroic, rather that the natural and normal thing to do if you see them. Have we become so separated, so uncaring to each other that we find his actions unusual, special and heroic? Wouldn't every one of you reading this do the same? If not, shame on you. Time to take a long hard look at yourself. Not taking away from him. He stepped up, acted like a man is supposed to, and did the right thing. Top man!
I was never that big on Schaub but after watching this i will always support anything this man is involved with. Big ups to you Schaub you are a real hero for what you did that day
Never been a huge fan of Brendan but massive respect to him for this
Dad will be judged. Believe me. God has a special place. I cried man, Jesus. You are a hero, you have no idea.
Even in a situation such as this , he still says “the window wasn’t broken , I’m not captain America” talking about getting the kids out of the car. Brendan can be a cringey guy sometimes , but few if any people on this planet has what it takes to do what this man dude in the situation he found himself In, nothing but respect to Brendan Schaub
Real HERO!! Captain America ain't got shit on you brother!!! Pray for that whole family! Great job!
Kids "oh no. We're in a tough situation and this fucking loser is the only one here to help.  I hope he doesn't exaggerate when he's telling this story"
Wow
Who thumbs down though.. Communists
Regardless of how you feel about Brendan's Opinion he went above and beyond to help those children. GOD BLESS the Children and  Brendan
Wow, incredible bravery. Massive respect  for that 👏👏
If my girl said keep going when no one is at the scene, imma have to break up.
Holy shit I saw this accident on the 101 just before the 405 near encino thurdsay night...Shit was the craziest thing I've ever seen...Jesus christ I can't believe of all drivers passing by, it happens to be one of my podcasts hosts that pulls out the kids..
Tells a lot about Schaub! He should've never stopped to think of himself. Another second or comment and he wouldn't of done anything. And he'll no I don't gain any respect for him over this. This is just what you do as a human being! Even still he finds a small ways to be a douche when telling it.
You are a hero Schaub. Thank God you were there at the right time.
❤️
You know what's crazy and kinda cool, the brain is constantly trying to tell Brendan to run and to save himself. Like his thoughts of he shouldn't be doing this cause it's super dangerous and that he has kids and it's not worth the risk. Brendan your a hero man, those kids have a second chance at life. Hope you take care of yourself and your family. God bless
Hang in there Brendan, you're a damn hero and an amazing person. To those children, you're superman
The kids now have a Go Fund Me or some sort thanks to social media/platforming and the Angel that God put there at that exact moment.   I just really hope those kids find help and prayers to the family. R.I.P Aimee G. ❤
God bless you Brendan
Funniest thing Brendan has ever said.
Couldn’t find the on go fund me. I hope they’ll be okay
The world needs more men like Brendan you have my respect forever
18 wheelers run on diesel
Man. This is so crazy, I was stuck in the traffic on the 101 behind that accident for about 2.5 hours. I knew it must have been a terrible accident, But I didn’t know just how terrible it really was. Thank you so much for stopping and saving those kids.
Brendan blocked me on Instagram awhile back but fuck man the guys a good soul
Wow just a truly inspiring story, very tough to fully take in
Brendan is hero
😳🙏I live in Hollywood n born n raised in LA.,    Saw this on our local news that night and I can’t believe this is how it all really happened.,     You’re a real G Schaub-      No bs man.  I think that mentally sick father was scared off by you….   Those boys had an angel watch over them that day🙏🙏🙏
The GoFundMe is closed for donations at just over $70,000.  Paths were meant to cross. I only wish for the innocent to remain so and alive. What happens to the person that’s willing to do that to their own flesh and blood? Seems fitting, if he were hit with a semi crossing back over the interstate, instead of a car.
im tearing up man, i hope that pos gets whats coming to him
Brendan God bless you foreal you did a very heroic thing. I’ll be praying for that family and for your piece of mind because seeing that must of been traumatizing
I know your busy Brendan but if you can try and check in on those kids whenever you have a chance
Jesus is Lord and King and Our Savior
I've never understood why all the hate for Bran. He is a badass. Full on B.A.D. ASS.
Us regular people don't get a chance to be a hero very often.  It sounds weird, but Be grateful.
Holy fuck what a story what a heroic act
Why does he remind me of token black
What a liar lmaoooooo water weed dune hair?
Life’s cruel god bless you
Wow that’s fucking crazy man honestly god bless you man I gotta say I deff respect you a hell of a lot more now that’s for sure fuck man your a real man brother crazy respect don’t ever be mad at your self bro you saved those kids life’s god bless you
Thank you lifesaver Brendon shaulb You were the gaurdian angel for that disfunctional family, got me teared up thanking you!❤Good man has my total respect SIR ... THE WORLD NEEDS MORE MEN LIKE YOU
178 dislikes? How awful of a human can you be to dislike this video smh
I usually think Brendan Schaub is a fucking clown but to see the emotion inside of him when he was telling the story was remarkable I've gained a lot of respect for you Brendan
We love you Schaub , this was heartbreaking to hear and heartwarming at the same time. Glad the family easily hit their fundraiser mark, prayers
Absolute MAAAD respect to Brendan.  What a terrible experience for everyone involved. Brendan showed his true colors here. Way to go bro. Seriously. Actual hero.
The Gofundme is now closed and is at 70k. YOU are a badass Brendan!!!!
When there proof you're bullshiting and you keep telling the story lmfao
Good dude brendan,. Good dude
I don't thibk Brendan is a bad dude, he's a bit of a goof and just tryna fit in is how I see it but this just proves the kinda guy he is.
It’s cute that Brenda is covering serious stories. She’s growing up right in front of our eyes
Honestly I wish this was true I would of respected this man he just gave me more reason to hate him and I’m actually pissed off right now.
Why lie about this? I don’t get it. They probably all laughing at him behind his back “hey Batman!” 👍
From a AAA driver ….you can put it behind you without ever forgetting….being brave sometimes involves being a little stupid …you already saved them ,you don’t need to fix the future too …great job !
I'm sure all the Brendan haters will like this comment, because if you really believe in something, they'll show themselves. Ain't it weird they aren't here rn
This guy people can say he’s a soft or gay dude but in a time of action where a man was needed he was there an handle everything correctly beautiful moment for Brendan
Speculating that he saved them… definitely made a good attempt to… could’ve easily got them all killed and in that case he would be a hero if he died but I don’t think he’s a hero… any good man would do this… if they were gonna die they would’ve died anyways man.. I learned basic first aid and trauma preparation for emergencies when I was 10yrs old I could’ve done the exact same thing and I would. I probably wouldn’t go talk about it on a Podcast like that.. he’s putting it together as a story so he can tell it…u can tell.. so yea he was probably scared and having flash backs of the octagon. Anybody would be.
Mad respect for Shaub💯🙏
So sad but great job helping them 😕💔🙏
He’s a hero ❤️💯💯💯❤️❤️😎🇨🇦
That’s mad props bro I’m so sad
When did callen gey back on the show?
Count your blessings may the souls that passed rest in peace
Shows your true character.   Your a hero dude
Hats off Brendan, your a real one for that 👏
Now we know why Brendan why he’s in this world. I kept wondering brendans purpose in this world 😂
Brendans the type of guy that sees an auto accident and …………      becomes a fucking hero !!!!!
I don't get how you can get in trouble in America for trying to help people?
that’s crazy man. thank god that man didn’t do anything to brendan after the accident
Man so many lives changed in a second. I hope that semi truck driver dosnt blame himself.
Im not crying, im weeping
Brendan, you are truly a great human being and I just came back to the channel because I heard Byran was back full time. I was very surprised to hear about this amazing act of bravery that you performed because I too have friends in Law Enforcement that have told me to never stop to help at a freeway wreck as it's the most dangerous thing to do but I'm glad the kids are safe and you didn't get hurt. I will always admire this act of amazing bravery on your part and will be a fan till the day I die. Great Job Brendan Schaub!
Good job, Brendan.
KEEP THINKING BOUT THE KIDS -Brenden Shaun 2021
Top man Brendon,not an easy thing to do.
Jeffrey Epstein “I was just thinking about those kids “
Schaub is an awesome human being.
Brenden Shaun in any promotional piece of his ever from now on “ I was just thinking of the kids”
How did the dad survive getting hit at 60 tho
No amount of counciling will remove this trauma and no amount of money will help Im not being negative just speaking from my personal account both my parents are gone mom was 11 pops was a couple years ago and I’ve never been able to fill that void I can’t even imagine these poor children and the kinda pain they’re feeling
Facts
Damn, just hearing Brendan choke up telling this I feel for him and everyone involved. So sad, much respect to him for doing the right thing and helping and being there
Well done, Brendan. I was involved in a similar situation 3 years ago. Myself and some buddies first first on the scene of an accident where 4 young men were killed. The images still haunt me. Make sure you get psychological help yourself. And remember, witnessing something like that, being there to help, is a blessing and a curse. You get to live knowing you did a good thing, but you also have to live with the horror and sadness. I hope you are able to reconcile it in your head. Congrats to you.
that was fucken heavy dude. good work by the Big Brown👍👍✔
Good man schaub
I'm sorry Brendan you had to experience that but you are a hero for getting in harms way and saving those children.
Schaub is a legend for this. talk all the shit you want about him but guarantee you you aint got the stones to do what he did. dudes a hero
Man fucking sad.. proud of you bro
You the man Schaub!!
I like videos like this because they put your "problems" into perspective.  Brendan a true hero for what he did.. messed up world we live in
Some people run away from danger some run towards it. My hat goes off to you Brendan.
I love Brendan for this man. So human. Made me tear up.
Police, firemen, paramedics, and tow truck drivers see this stuff everyday. Look how shook B is... if ur out there hating on ppl who support first responders or the first responders themselves .... ur a punk and that's it
That has got to be the oldest youngest man I’ve ever seen before
But where is the dad ?
You did what was right bro
Hero
Hero
Proud of you Brendan
Cheif wahoo for life
I just don’t get why Brendan didn’t just stand far away with the kids and wait?
The world needs more brave actions like this. We need more love on this earth especially these days. God bless you Brendan those kids will always remember your kindness.
Mr. Schaub, you are the greatest ! A genuine hero.
Damn too bad that dad didn't get killed by the second vehicle.
Huge respect for that. Those kids definitely need therapy and help. Brendan is a big man to do what he did and for how he's going about it.
Brendan those kids will forever remember big dawg. They will hold you in their hearts for the rest of their lives. I pray that you will find comfort in knowing that brotha. Blessings to your family and those young lives you saved that day.
Brendan you absolutely did the right thing. You’re a good man. The go fund me isn’t accepting any donations now but I’d love to kick in for those kids💜
You the man Brendan. God bless those kids
Thanks for answering the bell Schaub. You are a good man.
LA fire department and the news published a different story what do yal think? 🤔
I always loved brendan schaub, this just shows how you should respect people even though they are famous, this guy went out of his way to help that family knowing the dangers of American highways
Ive always defended him because i really like his podcasts and stuff but damn on a human level ppl have too take a step back saying hes fucking making this up! Jesus! The internet trolling and giving him shit yeh i understand its part and parce of the job and he knows that, and i do defend him because i actually like his shows but not his standup, but this is too far accusing him of lying.. and not just tht he clearly and rightly so was really needing too cry, but held it in prob because of all the delia shwaab shit which he deserved the trolling, for this he has every reason to cry fuck
Schaub is a hero
wow dude this man and those kids are brave as shit
Brendan, always liked you and your big heart. You’ve always come across as a good guy. This shit here, though…definitely top tier heroism. We’re proud of YOU.
Brenden usually irritates me.  Not today ..........thats all.
I call bullshit. Let's see a news story.
How are people still watching these cool guys try to climb the ladder? Just move on. The Rogan fight companion days are looooooong gone
18 wheeler with gas huh, really?
Damn just from posting this video the go fund me went from 20k to 70k. I'm sure after I post this it will get bigger
Brenden, I want to personally applaud you for your brave and heroic actions during such a traumatizing event. You are a true hero.
Heartbreaking
This is bad  But respect man Hope the kids end up ok
Diesel is not gas
While the story was surprising.. I was not surprised Brendan Schaub would do something like this. As much as people bust his balls... I knew he was a real one. Hope others can finally realize.
Respect brendan!
See those kids once a year and take them to a ufc event. Positive energy and real male role models is better then any college fund.
Hero!!!! Respect!
GOOD MAN
Great hat!
God Bless you Brendan you are real one a true Hero.
Ah man sorry that’s so horrible
You can hear the pain in his voice.
Fuck that guy... Shaub is a true hero.
Mad props to Brendan, I know we all love to clown him but he a real one.
If Brendan Schaub isn't fighting anymore and hasn't fought in years why the fuck do his ears still look like that?
B Shaub just became heavyweight UFC champ again off this alone . Big hero , big respect bro
Brendan you are one of the good guys in this world because of you Donations and thort are with those kids all the way from Australia so please mate keep doing you wouldn’t have you any other way truly great person
Schaub needs to start his own serious podcast, talks with soldiers actors anyone cause schaubs the man
Awh man my respect for this man just went through the roof. Hero. I rarely cry and this had tears flowing down my face - those kids, I just hope they are ok. Fuck :(
30 grand to be buried ????
Of course the shithead dad lived and not the mother. What a fuckin mess. Good on Brendan for stopping for those kids.
Classic Brenda throws his girl under the bus like he usually does to everyone close to him and lies about the hole thing and the only thing worse than all that is acting like ur crying what a psychopath
This is the only Video that on the internet that Has Brendan Swaab in it that doesn't have a 50/50 Like to dislike ratio.
Damn man that’s heavy 😔
Well done Schaub.
I found a new respect for this dude 🙌 God bless
real hero shit right here no question. those kids are going to look up to brendan for the rest of their lives.
God bless you Brendan. A true American hero.
Fucking hero man.
Good job brendon. I'll raise the kids. I wanna
Yup, dude is for real but the haters will still talk shit. Good on you Brendan.
I know Schaub gets alot of shit for not being the smartest or the funniest. But he does care and have a loving heart, and that's something very very hard to learn. I use to be one of the people that would dog and joke on him but mad respect and love. You are a true man and hero.
The father needs to be put down.
hero.
There are no words for this. I'm glad you stopped but I'm sorry that the kids and yourself went through this.
*diesel
Police report says otherwise
So much respect, it's a lot of things all at once. Focus your mind on what you heroes did that day, rather than who caused it all... there are no answers there. You were called upon and you were up to the task.
damn
“If not you, who? If not now, when?” I love that quote great job on Brendan for stepping up and being a real hero. I swear to you there will be no more Brendan slander from me
Never had an opinion on Schaub either way, but this is the kind of thing I hope I'm able to do if I ever come across a scene like that. Much love Brendan, you are one of the good ones.
In all reality WHO’S DISLIKING THIS!!!!!
I’ve been the first on scene to an accident where the driver was DOA and it’s horrifying so I can’t imagine how tough it was to have the children there and keep them separated from seeing their mother! Kudos to Brendan I truly have so much respect for you hearing that you stopped and helped! I really hope that you can get over the trauma of this experience
Yeah that's cool and all .... but can you stop doing stand up — please ?
Dont forget his misses said "keep going" past the accident with kids in. Let that sink in, what that says about her.
Not a Brendan fight fan. Not a Brendan comedy fan. Not a Brendan podcast fan. This tho, did make me simply a Brendan fan. Big props bro.
idk i feel like brenden lieng....he lies alot so its hard to tell whats true.....and whats a lie...but if its actually tru then good for him for being a hero and im glad hes helping those kids with money and funeral that is awsome
Thank you Brendan for doing such a wonderful thing and keeping our faith in humanity. You represent how real men should respond. God is in you bro! Your life will now have a new meaning. God bless!
Hat's off to Brendan, ..gives hope to &  for  humanity!!
Hero you’re a hero
Props B. Respects from Miami 🤜🏽💯🤛🏽
When he said it wasn't a funny story I busted out
Holy shit man, that's really really really sad
Schaub is a good dude.
idk how some people dont like shaub,  a family man  and u can tell hes a positive person to be around.
I always liked this guy. Why do people hate him
Respect to Schaub. I always wondered how id react if saw something like this. Sorry their mom passed but it could've been worse... I guess I need to quit hating on Schaub
There is A LOT of hate for this dude out there in the world. But, I can only imagine how many of you edge lords would get out of their vehicles to save a bunch of kids. Schaub is a real one for this, remember this mans actions next time you feel like being critical of him.
Brendan is a badass, he is a hero, and everyone who hears this will be proud of him.
You did a good thing man. Idk you, you probably won't read this, but I'm proud of you man.
All Jokes aside... y'all wish you were Brendan.
Maybe the Fighter and Kid subreddit can finally calm down and realize B ain't a bad guy lol he's just trying to make it in a cutthroat industry.
Thank God for brave men like Brendan!
Sad story may she Rest In Peace🕊…. But let’s not missed the fact that Brendans wife wanted to drive away when she saw that 7yr old yelling for help
Brendan the fact that you didn't let those kids look at their mom like that really just proves that you have the heart and mind of an amazing human being. Tears came to my eyes hearing this. You saved children's lives!!!!
You're a good man Brendan Schaub. Sorry you Had to deal with that man.
Thank you Brendan your a badass man keep patting yourself on the bsck for this one
Sang Schaub, nothing but respect. Your a honest guy. Your a good dude.
I was waiting or the punchline ..  it never came 😑
This shit had me in tears.. I can’t even imagine 😭😭your an absolute legend dude
Get them around the men you know so they have a community to fall back on
Damn bro. You made the difference. That's all you need to remember.
Never did I think Brendan fucking schuab would get me so emotional damn real shit
They should of left the gofundme open
Gay
Blesss you schaub
Good on you Brendan ! true fucking hero mate
Wildddd. Sometimes I see confrontation and/or fights with other people but it's so easy to be like, not my business cause shit can go way bad for you just trying to help. So Shaub and guys like him foreallll run towards the fire. 👍  When I was a little kid I got caught in a rip current in Baja Mex., nearly drowning and this random guy came to pull me to shore. Never talked to him afterwards and it was wild cause no one was at that beach that day, just right place at the right time.
He’s a fucking hero. But this is probably something he is going to carry for a long time. The kids will carry it even longer. Thoughts and prayers for all of them (and the trucker too). I hope the dad falls on a shank in prison
Holy fuck, poor fucking kids. No mom, horrible dad, physical injuries, extreme emotional trauma, unknown future, etc.   Good on schaub for entering that genuinely extremely dangerous situation to help me out, and after the fact help  Truly traumatic shit
*Schaub is a tool all he did was copy other guys already helping and now he's virtue signaling lol that's what fake people do*
This was heavy but thank you for sharing your experiences 🙏
Cool story, but you're still not funny.
I wanna help. Keep us posted please
This is why I always liked Brendan all these years. Yeah say what you will about his comedy, but at the end of the day he is a good guy. He's a good natured guy, who cares about others.
Im fucking crying that’s so messed up man ughhhh
That black guy on the right is like non-existent. Brendan literally never looked his way even once. hahahaha
This was the work of man powered by god.
Dude that story fucked me up. Good job helping out
Your a hero Brendan, you did the very best for those children in that situation. You were sharp under pressure and you spared those kids from even more trauma!  So proud you! 🙏🏼♥️ Everyone donate something, even it’s small it’s going to a good place!
Well done Brendan
Good job Brendan
You're a hero bro. Those kids are good because of you. Life will bless you even more because of this now.
I love you dude, your such a good person. This shits real out here and people like you, despite notoriety,  you as a human are whats right in this world. Thank you for your selfless act, you put hope and light back in this world. Thank you Thank you thank you.
All respects to you Brendan. You risked everything to help those kids. There's not a more noble sacrifice than to risk your whole world for others. I pray you and the kids find a healthy way to coup with what you witnessed and experienced. Even though they've suffered the great loss of their mother, I'm glad they gained a guy like you to look up to and to strive to imitate. I know you'll find a way to stay in their lives. We need more genuine men like you.   As for the father of that family; I truly hope they DONT give you the death penalty, you may have succeeded on murdering your beautiful wife but you failed at taking your own and your kids, I want you to live with that for the rest of your life. I hope you get pumped daily by your fellow inmates, I hope they pass you around more than a Baptist collection plate. Hope your reminded everyday that your there because you were to big of a coward to face your problems like a man, and that you're a even bigger coward for trying to take out your family along with potential strangers. I would gladly fork over tax dollars to keep you alive as long as possible. May you live a long life in prison.
Brendan you’re a genuine hero. I’m praying for your peace brother.
Wow, you are something else Schaub. You did in an incredible thing. Every move you made in that situation was THE move to make. From pulling over & sprinting to help, to the way you talked to the kids after pulling them from the wreckage. AND you guys got a great idea going raising money with a stand up show or something. You’re a real one B! Gonna donate what I can as well
So sad, such a beautiful lady and so sad that people have to deal with domestic abuse. It is one of the worst things to deal with. Getting those kids out was the right thing to do dude.  You did the right thing.
Props to Brendan!  Go CU!  Bigger accomplishment than beating Mirko Crocop
Thanks for getting in there and being a good example for everyone, and thank God for putting you there. My girl would have said the same thing "keep going you have a family" but you were needed.
Brendan to the rescue. All the Schaub haters could never have the heart or courage to do what he did. Y'all better start laughing at his jokes regardless if you find him funny or not.
theo wouldnt of done this.
That's crazy, some sick bastard that father of the kids is. Big respect to Brendan and RIP to the mother.
Good Job Brandon!!!! A fathers instinct is spot on if youre a father he is. God bless the kids!!!! Terrible situation!!!
Your a great dude Brendan great dude I’m sorry you had to deal with that but so glad you did
I’ll never talk shit about Brendan again.
literally putting Gofundme in the title... lol
I did not liked you since u KO’d Mirko Cro Cop but now i love you man!!! REAL HERO!!!!
Good shit Brendan  Literal life saver!
Got me welling up. Damn. :(
Got me welling up. Damn. :(
Brendan "a hero & a goofy weird guy" Schaub  Much respect for you bro 🙏🏾
That's a bold self less act my guy we need more people in the world like you and the kid. Makes me feel even better that I'm a fan of both of you
Any update on how we can help the kids
Damn that’s absolutely wild. Huge respect to Brendan for the heroism and putting himself in harms way to make sure the children were safe. Extremely brave and well handled by Brendan. Glad to know we have good hearts out there amongst all the evil
Good on you Brendan. Not just anyone could do that. We’d like to think so, but most people are selfish when it comes to a life or death situation and would just think of their own safety. True hero
This set is horrid
Real hero man. Good job Brendon
Ok anyone else bothered by how Shaub never once looks at or interacts with the guest lol
It truly is a sad fucked up world out here.
Damn hella emotional story... Brendan is solid as fuck and those kids will have a hard life but they truly got lucky to have been saved by someone like him who will continue to help raise money for them and pay for the funeral and shit
Bro. Shit got me over her like 🥺😢. Love U Schaub
Damn I chocked up for a bit.
Give Brendan a fucking break. Geez.
PTS can last year's 😥
Brendan is an amazing human being and as a 23 year old truck driver this shit is so scary that man is a monster who did that to those children and that poor woman Rest In Peace.
Brandon you will forever be those kids’ Superman
Wow I've been a fan for a while but what a hero Brendan has become wow
Ok brendan you are off limits now
This made me cry. You are a good man Brendan
Schaub is a real life super hero
No more Schaub jokes
u have a wife but no ring?
Brendan is a fucken beast for doing this!
Get some therapy Brendan I'm an ex soldier and it works mate well done for your brave actions you saved those children
Wow,  thank God he was there at the right time, a true hero at heart. pray for them all, and hopefully  brandon is OK because  that could be a very  traumatic  event for anyone to have to endure.  Best wishes go out for him as well.
What a bore!!!!
That’s very admirable brenden❤️
I was a truck driver. I've been through a similar situation and it's weighs heavily on you. I got mad respect for this man.. stay strong and God Bless 🙌 ... I know you would say your not, but you are a real hero..
That's sad bro thanks for helping and doing the right thing in the moment 🤘
Lies
Debreez
Jokes aside… I’ve always really admired brendan, he’s a great person all around. But now, the dude is legendary.
“Babe just keep going” worst type of human
Good job Brendan! You are the real one
30 grand for a funeral! And that’s just basic. Don’t be a burden to ur children, go on a cruise and jump in when it’s ur time.
You’re a true man and I respect you so much
Tears rolling down my cheek.. My heart goes out to those young souls🙏🏽
Hero
i used to hate on you mate . that will never happen again . much respect
He’s a damn lier how u gna be driving and not notice the 18wheeler first?
True heroes rise, even in the face of danger they rise. Bravo Brendan 👏
These comments are usually filled with Brendan haters. Maybe no more trashy people.
Love how he threw his wife under the bus on her thoughts to not stop and help.
Never was a big fan of you Brendan but now, I have so much pride and respect for you sir!! I am now a fan of you sir. Well done you have just help changed those corse of those babies lives. Proud of you dude 🤙🏽
Brendan is a legend
Weird how his wife was like, "keep driving keep driving". As she saw kids that needed help. Jeez 😳
Hes one of the few that would help you if you were dieing on a side of a highway everyone else would just drive by slow to just look at u this is a human being that matters even more .
I think it's a bit more complicated than the guy trying to kill his whole family is an idiot.
For as much as this guy sucks at stand up, he’s a hero. I can’t make jokes about this guy anymore because he did something basically nobody else would do aside from first responders. I know I’d have stopped in my tracks the moment I smelled the gas.
Shaub I hope is gonna seek some trauma therapy after this. Glad he didnt listen to his girl when she told him to keep on driving.
Fuckin story got me in tears. Damn dude. Brendan is a hero
What a story- holy shit Brendan. Respect to you man. Huge respect. Massive. Love you man
I've always liked brendan I was rooting for him in the ultimate fighter against big country Nelson and all that
whoaaaa WAIT A SECOND... TFATK is back!?!? Omg I’m so happy
Nice work Brendan, maybe you should do that for a living instead of comedy?
Hopefully people can finally give this man alot more respect after this
You're a fucking hero Brendan Schaub, bless you friend
Never look at this guy the same again. Brendan you're a hero buddy.
Honestly dont know anything about this guy... but im so glad he was there that day.
70k raised, fuck yeah…
Holy shit
🇨🇦 Brendan love from Canada . Way to step up and do what any real man would have ..🇨🇦👍
It broke my heart to read this, I can't listen to it, it's so heartbreaking.
damn i admit i had a negative opinion of this dude just because of what ppl say on the internet even though i barely know anything about him. this dude is a hero 100% respect now
This vid made me subscribe . Real hero
I'm in bits. Absolutely awful.
❤️
Throws his woman under the bus for extra credit .. Slimeball.
wow....all new level of respect for b Schaub. thats a real hero right there ...and you can tell hes feeling it. what a great guy
People talk shit but Brendan is cool as fuck!
Brendan  is a great dude and he did a great heroic thing. Did he have to call the one kid fat tho? Lol  ,just playin
Brendan! You have a beautiful heart. I’m in tears listening to this. Always wishing you the best
Great work, Brendan. Some of us can’t help in those situations (I’m paraplegic in a wheelchair), but wish we could. You’re a hero 💙🙏
Great guy. His comedy is still ass.
Brendan is a man that every guy should aspire to be like. He is so brave.
Hats off to you Brendan.  Good stuff.
Look man, not a huge fan of Brendan Schaub - but this...this was incredible - full respect man. That's a tough ask and you saved those kids life.
Wow that's horrible god bless that family and u Brendan
The fighter and the rapist or is it the rapist and the kid? - pending the outcome of the lawsuit
Yeah no.
What an absolute hero man.
Respect. You see kids in danger, you stop and you help. Well done Brendan.
Schaub got me crying
Not gonna hate on Schaub anymore
U say your  not captain American but u save those kids.  that’s some hero shit right there man  god bless you bro
🙏🏼
Good man Brendan
On thing I remember Brenda saying is he couldn't respect a man who didn't stick around for his children no matter what, after he had his first kid
Wow is TFATK back?
I find his hat externally offensive to native Americans
What a hero Brendan! May your good deeds be multiplied ten fold! Thank you for being a hero!
Respect to Brendan
just a glimpse of what first responders see through an entire career
Brendan’s life has changed forever after this. He’s going to do right by those kids, and he’ll most likely have a relationship with them going forward. What he did was brave, and my opinion of him will always be that he’s a great person. Kudos to you, and I hope those kids are okay going forward.
Fuck now we gotta like this guy… mad respect! Rip to the moms and I’ll pray for those kids 🙏🏼
I totally respect you now schab you're a hero man you are.
God Bless you my man praying for all families involved.
Ayeeee when did Brian return ??
I’ve given Brendan a lot of shit for not being funny. But god damn it I love him now
Good shit sir 👍👍
You did a good thing schaub, dont beat yourself up for any reason you, priortized those kids as you shouldve.
Anyone else crying on the toilet ?
Brendan, you are a hero. I'll never hate on you again.
Thank you Brendan !!!!
Schaub is the man. Thank God you were there to help those kids.
Brendan...thank you for telling this story. I can tell how hard it is tell this story. Hang in there dealing with this experience. Those children received a blessing that day...YOU! find comfort in THAT!!! I pray for those children and for you to find some peace.🙏🏽
Fair play pal tragic absolutely tragic
RESPECT Brenden
Brendan is a great man! And he’s pretty funny too!
They just gotta stay out of the system
Used to really dislike Brendan because of all the obvious reasons and never really gave a shit to listen to him but he is a hero for this and I have to respect him for it
Respect to schaub, even if he's an annoying twat at times much respect to him for this hope they raise loads of money for them poor kids..
All respect to Brendan, true inspiration
Brendan is a hero
Respect to Brendan man.
Well done Brenny.
I hope he adopts those boys
Wow inspirational little faith back in humanity
Respect to Brendan
I think even the police would have liked brendan smashing that guy given how he injured one of the cops   I wonder if this is drug and mental illness related its just really fucking weird
Pos is back. Awww.
Respect
Man, why’d  he have to throw his wife under the bus like that?
i dont want to hear anyone talking shit about Brendan anymore, he knocked out cro cop too.
You’re a good man, Brendan Schaub!
What an incredible man with such a big heart kudos to you Mr. Schaub God-bless you your family and those kids and their family kids and their family Just heard this story on the way to work it's 8 at work as a father of 4 got me teared up
Brendan looks like the type of guy who pulls over on the highway to save an entire family in a car crash 👏🏼
Brendan, you did an amazing job, and you are helping these kids have a future.  You helped change their history and the day that was the most horrific day of their life, where they saw all the evil in the world in their own father, they saw bravery and love from a complete stranger who cares not only enough to help them that day, but throughout their growing years.   You have no idea what type of impact you have for the children yet, but I hope one day you can let go of the pain you are carrying and be as proud of yourself as we are of you.   On a different note, I just retired from 28 years of policing, most of it a violent crime detective.  You have PTSD right now.  Anyone in this situation would.  I never knew I had received so much until I retired and was able to let it all out.  Take care of yourself, and I am sure your family in law enforcement can help you take care of yourself after this extremely traumatic incident.   You truly are a hero, and have a huge heart.  Take care of yourself brother.
Brendan the type of guy to be a fucking hero.
Brandon thanks bro.
"I'm not like fucking captain America"  To those kids, you are.
Respect man.... So sad
Diesel*
What a tragic story. The poor kids lost their mother and have to live with that memory. Thanks for being a hero when it really counts
Good man
Ive always kind of shit talked Schaub. Not for any real reason, but never again. God bless you Sir.
Brendan should have given that shitty father a big ol dose of surf n turf
what a good guy. my only knowledge of schaub is when he's on jre, but he's a top lad.
When I was in 10th grade I was on i75 in Florida. Up ahead of me was a 18 wheeler with an excavator on the trailer. I’m maybe 50 yards behind it. The excavator arm hits the overpass and rips it off the trailer. Smoke and dust everywhere. I go down to the median and around it all. An old man maybe 85 his the arm directly. His engine was in his passenger seat. He broke his arm bad and was dazed real bad. Had to smash his window to get him out. Me and 2 other guys. Broke his window and peeled his door down enough to help him out. Crazy happened at maybe 7pm. Sat out in the middle of i75 for a good 6 hours. I was barefoot at the time also. I had a friend and my little brother in my car. I have my shoes to my little brother who didn’t have any at the time. Crazy time. It takes a special person to run towards a car accident that is on fire. You did awesome brendon.
Is wife said keep going ???
bless you brendan your a good dude
Heartwarming story now back to the point. Who's coming to Brendan's next show. Buy your tickets now before they're sold out.
Well done, Mr. Schaub. These are the actions of a hero. Don’t listen to the typical moronic haters. I think it’s great that helping these kids in the aftermath of this tragedy. It won’t erase the trauma and the loss of their mother, but raising money to help set these kids up, will give them something long-term to make their lives a little easier after this horrible nightmare. With your platform, your name recognition, as well as your many high profile celebrity friends, it shouldn’t be too hard for you to raise a lot of money for these kids up pretty easily. Like a college fund or some kind of a trust, to help them out when they get older. Not having to worry about money is a big burden to have relieved. I have a feeling a lot of people will donate to a cause like this. Bravo, sir.
Shapel hung in there, playing the master like a pro
70K raised for the mothers funeral. Well done TFATK army.
129 ppl don't have lives smh
You're the man brother. Well done
Atleast the roads are safer now. P.s. how do you know the mother wasn't in on it?
Proper champ Brendan, most men wouldn't of even pulled over. Hope your okay dude
Brendan, you did a very brave and selfless thing that is very inspiring. Now it is over and those kids are safe, make sure you also take care of yourself! You were worried about not getting back to your own kids when you were on the scene. The danger is not over, PTSD is a real thing, don't let it take you away from your family.
I've seen the horrors.brendan your a hero
You're a gem!!  that was extremely brave what you did.
I'm proud of you.
His wife telling him to keep driving when there's a kid asking for help. What a POS
HERO all day. Wow. Now that was a crazy situation.  LA crazy as hell
Hes no comedian. Hes a fucking hero
Damn, Brendan. 😔
When he mentioned seeing the mom for the first time the whole atmosphere of the room changed… like he’s channeling something really sinister yet meaningful…
Your a ledgend schaub!
I dunno if Brendan will ever see this but I really hope that he goes and talks to a professional about this. My dad was first on a scene with dead kids and it seriously messed him up for a really long time, he's still dealing with it years down the line. No one is too tough to seek psychological help.
Hero
You did real good what a man I was crying too..
I can say from personal experience he is absolutely correct when he said you can watch all the movies and think about what it is like but when you do see it in person you are never the same after.   And making a point to where the kids did not see it was the reason I believe he was put in the position.   I think someone else may have stopped to help them.   But having the forethought to say run in the potentially more dangerous direction than even take a chance of the kids seeing their mom for the last time like that is some real hero shit.  That’s the stuff that people don’t think about normally and the fact that he did is outstanding.
Brendan the size of a 18 wheelie
Holy shit!! Fairplay Brendan.. keep us posted on fundraisers for the children!!
Acting in the face of fear, true courage, love Schaub, heroic.
this is probably the funniest story brendumb has told. water we doin here
Diesel aint flammable on normal atmospheric pressure FYI so don't worry about it, shout out to the big brown though God bless you brother
respect
Who's the black dude? Did he win a competition or something to watch the show live?
you might not have been a champ in the ufc but you're a champ in life brendan!
Big up to you Brendan🙏🏼🙏🏼
Anyone’s think he’s telling truth or lying ? Bit off both? https://youtu.be/hxOjZqeZPuI
Rest In Peace to the Mom!
GOD Bless You Brendan! Those poor kids! That evil lunatic dad... so many evil lunatics in the news lately...wow
You might get some shit for being a bit of a potato sometimes Brendan, but I don’t think anyone questioned how big your heart is, or how good a person you are.   I hope you’ve slept easier since you’ve talked about this. A lot of people would have stayed in their car. A sincere well done, you big lump.
Awesome job Brendan. Hats off to you brother.
What a legend emotional one man
brendan schaub is a hero
Unreal
He's lying
Your a fucken legend Brendan honestly brother don't no you or those kids but thanks for doing what U done and are doing for the family
Jesus Christ..
wait the alleged rapist is back? Thought he got canceled.... Never heard Rogan mention it or speak up for his friend so leads me to believe it was true.
This is low even for Schaub... Paying a guy to try and kill his entire family just so he can have a story to tell on this failing podcast. Low as fuck!
Way to describe the one kid as an "out of shape child" classy
My eyes teared up.. you’re a hero Brendan 🙌🏼
bring back callen. get rid of brandon and chaplain. but bring back brianna
Brendan well done mate. That kind of character is what the world needs. So proud of you and that little boy too
God bless you Schaub. Heartbreaking story man. Fuck….
Give them a porche gt3 lmaooo
Hit up Steve will do it!
Fuck man that's rough..
Good man
Brendon 🙏🙏 Real life hero...
:(
Good man Brendan that’s crazy not many would have done what you did
What a hero
If anyone is a Tire Salesman.. I have a lead for a guy looking for 18 new tires hmu
Holy Shit! That is a crazy ass story, and Brendans actions were nothing less than heroic. Your a good man Brendan God bless you. 🙏
God bless you Brendan
looks like the crew from tropic thunder  trying to outrun each other with emotionality. jk love you guys
jesus man, those images will be with you awhile....talk it out until your red in the face, dont bottle that up. incredible act of courage and true heart!
Now all of you assholes that give him so much shit can understand why I always took up for him. Schaub is good people. I guarantee you that thousands passed that accident and couldn't be bothered.
Calling bullshit
Make sure that dad never has contact again
I bet all the schaub haters feel a little bad after this one
🙏
Respect to Brendan but more importantly let's get together and help those kids now. Brendan don't forget to look after yourself either after being through something like that it can be hard, I know the crew has your back.
Jesus
Holy shit dude....
Keep us posted B. The go fund me is closed. We got this tfatk army.
I know we shit on brendan a lot, but deep down he's a good guy
You're a real one Schaub!
Much respect, Brendan. 💯
I usually got annoyed with Brendan's interrupting but because of his actions I'm going to never complain about him again. Good shit Brendan
Damn good shit brenden....everyone clowns on him but he did 👍
I always talked shit on Schaub, I like him now. Still don’t think he’s funny but he is a genuinely great person.
Fuck. I guess I like him now. Good job dude!
good man
Dude so much respect. Maybe consider talking to a someone tho. No matter how tough you are PTSD is a real thing. Much love bro.
Holy shit. Damn Schaub you got a big fucking heart.
Cant even imagine what those kids are going through at such a young age. I was recently in traumatic car accident breaking my vertebrae and with the support of friends and family I have recovered tremendously and have gotten over the mental block. They will most definitely need as much help as they can get. With car accidents its tough because they occur so often and it can happen to anyone but the fact that it was the father who caused this on his own family just ruins me. Everyone should always hope to make it home safely, nobody deserves this. Huge kudos to Brendan for helping not only was that kid courageous but you were as well. This hits home a little bit and I am a fan of yours for life now.
God placed him in the right spot to help those in need
If Schaub knew the dad was a piece a shit….
Bubba, tfatk army came through as much as they could.
Great job man. I think I would have done the same, seeing kids in distress there is no way of not interceding. You have a good heart and of all you did I think the talks you had with the kids may be the most impactful. Trying to process anything their heads must have been going haywire. Such a sad story.
Let’s help those kids 🙏🙏🙏
H-e-r-o.
So in this version of the story he’s covered in gasoline…
Tell me more Brandon
If he was going to gain my respect he’d say he didn’t really wanna talk about it, but of course Brandon is not that type of person
Great job!
Now everyone is suddenly a fan and always like Brendan. Oh fuck off.
Bro he's downplaying himself as he tells the story of him saving kids life bro. It's insane man
Being a fighter=good Being a comedian=Eh Being a selfless human=priceless No words for you Schaub.  (Can’t stop crying)
Idk who you are but you solid
Brendan you're such a legend ! THANK for that kids 🙏
Holy fuck Brendan Schaub is so strong God bless him. Brendan if you're reading this the whole world is so proud of you and you deserve everything good that comes to you and your family
All that donated.... Thank you, this fanbase is so caring. I donated as well before anyone trolls me. They're over 70,000, true hero's in my book. I saw so many TFATK fans, I love Ya'll
Why would you come on here to tell the story Brendan, even though the police said police pulled the children out. Say the story is legit…when you do something to help someone who truly needs it, it’s unnecessary to go shouting it from the roof tops bro. A narcissist feels the need to tell a heroic story.
You are a fucking hero, sir. Much love to the family. Respect ✌
Good shit my guy you’re a saint
Sorry I miss judged you Brandon. You're a n absolute fucking hero
You’re a hero Schaub. We love you man!
God bless you Brendan! 🙏🏻💪🏼
❤️🙏🏻
Atleast it was diesel. You can throw a match in diesel
Way to go Brendan
What a legend.
Bawling my eyes out rn. I hope those kids are fine.
Much respect to you Brendan.
Anti Jon Jones
Holy F man. Super hero
Wow this is sad. Those poor kids…poor Brendan…
Respect.
Hero
Superman for real!!!!
Dam, all the Brendan haters should be silenced after this one.      What a tragedy
This made me cry
I am so sorry to hear this story.  I hope that everybody envolved will keep it together. That those kids gets there childhood whom they deserve. Brandon get some professional help you sound you are in survival modus. You did the right thing, thanks.
Me being a semi driver have had ppl do that wanting to commit suicide by truck it's a horrific thing and scary. Brendan u are a good man
We love ya Schaub ❤️
Damn this is a crazy Respect man that’s some Traumatic shit
Got damnit Brandon I love you man your such a good man and will always will be!
Life is a ruthless, cold hearted bitch. Hang in there people.
Brendan, I know you probably won't see this but I hope you know that those boys will forever remember the man who came to their rescue at their pos dad ran away. You are a superhero to them.  I hope you understand that this was a real trauma for you too and I hope that you do not hesitate to seek some help.
I'm so grateful people like Brendan exist.
Good on you , Brendan.
Nothing but respect for you doing this Brendan. Prayers up for the family.
Schaub did a good deed here, but he still sucks as an entertainer. Can’t we hold both of those thoughts?
You can tell Schaub's heart rate is up as he's telling this story, there most have been so much adrenaline
It’s a crazy world we live in right now. When human instinct kicks in and you leave caution to the wind, your heart is open and your mind is clear. You did an awesome thing mate. You should be proud.
God Bless you @brendanschaub If every one of us could go out of our way in the slightest way to help our neighbors when in need, the world would be a much better place.   We are all proud of you over here brother.   “In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭5:16‬ ‭
Damn bro, prayers up man.. def seek some help to cope with this bro, I seen a bad highway wreck too, fucked me up till this day
Lies
Damn Brendan. That is a gnarly story. I'm so sorry for you to have to carry that trauma, but know that the good you have done will pull you through man! Forget the movies people, this is what Superman looks like!
Damn dude killin me right now !! I cant even imagine much respect to you !!! Schaubs on another level with me after this .
This hits a little different 🙏
Everyone says they do something until they’re in the situation and most don’t. Brendan, you seriously did something so brave it’s hard to put into words. Your true character shows and those kids have another chance because your actions and swift instincts! You risked your life and I hope you recover from this and stay strong mentally. I hope those kids get through this and Rest In Peace for their beautiful mother. You’re amazing Brendan
Brendan my god bless you and your family man. You did somthing fucking amazing, you're a real hero man!
So proud of you for this. Amazing and beyond brave. Fight or flight and you stepped up big time bubba. 🖤
Brandon you a damn good person
You ABSOLUTE LEGEND, Brendan
Thank you for being a hero Brendan!  Will pray for their family as well as you and yours 🙏
Fuck. That hit me right in the feels.
Brendan is a clown and many other things but he is no coward or a bad human being. Respect.
Brendan Shaw you did a good deed and a hero I wish more people were like you.
A great man Brendan is. Very happy his kids can have a father like that and your a role model Brendan.
And so it was, the 18th of August was to be forever known as Schaub day, the one day of the year we don't pick on Brendan and we delight in his heroic deed.
real hero
Fuckin awesome always admired brenden real recognize real
Bin there buddy shits crazy
Remember seeing my cousin with his head shot when I was like 13 and I haven't been ok since its traumatizing
good work Schaub. Welcome to the world of first reponsders. take care of your mental health after this experience sir.
Fucking super hero dude
Definition of a HERO!
Everyone only hated Brendan because a joke he made about Rogan slinging dick lol or maybe they're still mad he knocked tf out of Mirko Cro Cop
I'm so sorry this happened. My heart is so broken for these babies. God bless you brother 🙏🏻 ❤💔❤
Thank you for sharing. This is heartbreaking. ❤️
Wow. I’m deeply moved by this. Thank you for sharing.
Brenden your awesome guy 👍🏻
What the fuck is this story?   Not really like a female to say, "Just keep going" when a child is waving in distress. And, how come it sounds like he's running a full block and through gas? And, the father immediately after getting hit by a car moving 60 mph, gets up and stares directly at UFC's Brendan Shaub? And, why doesn't he comment on the waving kid when he approached the vehicle? Did he help him down and whatnot? Or, did he just disappear? And, why ask if there's anybody else in the car? You didn't see a dead woman in the front seat? And, why does he say, "Take these two kids and run that way"? It was only after Callen asked about the third child that he then had some story about encouraging him. And, when did he tell him he was a "badass" when he apparently sprints back to his car immediately. And, where was the fourth kid? The news reported four children being in the car. And, why would a woman argue about what direction to go, she wanted to run back through the wreckage? Really? And, where's she supposed to be taking them to, the next county? Tell her to distance the kids from the accident and stay put until help arrives. "No, don't go that way! The mom's that way!" Sounds like a poorly written script.  And, when did he have this conversation with the trucker. Head on collisions happen lightening fast, there's no "I swerved left he swerved left, I went right he followed right". More like, "He just cut right into me before I could even react!" And, especially when a death is involved, who in the fuck leaves the scene of an accident. A person willing to go through all that will usually feel obliged to stay until the cops and paramedics come. Too dangerous? he says. Distance yourself from the wreckage and wait. I'm thinking "date night" was more important. If he's confused about what happened, fine. Traumatized? Understandable. I just hope this isn't another embellished story because that would be fucked.
Respect to Brendan, sorry for the kids
I would love to donate but they are no longer accepting donations!! The people on this channel are amazing!
And to think that his girl, a mother herself, told him not to stop . . . smh. Good on you, Brendan.
Respect
What a hero
Thank you Brendan. Seriously thank you.
Respect 👏
You done well. You did what you had to and put yourself in danger in the process. Hope you get through this ok. It’s how you come through this that will show what your made of ❤️
Shows how delicate life is. Also much respect to those first responders who see things like this all the time
Respect to Schaub man🙌🏾
I was hearing this podcast  while at work , and I starting crying   While working , every one was like what up with you lol
Is there a go fund me anywhere where I can send some cash? This is one of the worst stories I’ve ever heard.
You’re a true hero, Brenden .  All this talk that we do every day about politics and other things that do not matter, this is real life. You are going to be responsible for changing the course of these kids lives. That is awesome.
Thank god for you man.
I hope someone close to Brendan keeps him from reading comments right now, he did all the right things and he has a lot of haters. Dudes just gotta get through this right now God damn is that heavy.
What an absolute hero of a human. Hats off to any first responder. It's a damn shame they don't get paid good for what they do. Last March they said I was passing a car on my way too work and had a head on collision with a fully loaded box truck at 70 mph. Crushed my legs, 18 broken bones, my face was peeled down like an orange from my scalp to my left eye, had severe trauma to my eye, and was bleeding out internally. The last thing I remembed was helping my gf decorate our kitchen for her daughter's bday then going sleep. I wake up for work but im not home I'm surrounded by people telling me I was just in a car accident and I've been in a coma for 3 weeks. I'm very happy that I don't remember that gnarly hellish of a morning but I'm sure the emt's will never forget it. Brendan, the world is a better place with heros like you living in it. 👍
you kind of are captain America, bro. prayers to you and your family.
Lies
Man this got me really emotional. Good thing you stopped Brendan
Fuck.. Not all heros where capes
They gotta stop hating on Brendan. He did the heroic act, and even more he shielded the kids from seeing their deceased mother. Tons of respect ✊🏻
Respect for you brother 🙏💯.  Good man
The fact people disliked this clip shows how fucked some people are in this world.
Honest to god Im not a huge brendan fan. But this is a incredible act of selfless heroism. Truly. God bless
What is chp?
Reminds me of a similar story I have driving down the New Jersey Turnpike where a crew of sports bike guys are flying through the traffic easy pushing 120 mph (we were going 80 and they smoked us) however they are weaving through the cars. We see the last guy come through, a gust of wind blows up his jacket and we see him slam full force into the back of a van, his bike explodes, and his body helicopters across a few lanes against the median wall. I’ve never seen anything like it, so close.  We stopped my dad got out and went to try to help. I got out to help move debris, my mom screamed at me. My dad telling me to get back. The bike guy was on the ground after that collision and presumably dead. My dead held his hand while others also helped. He didnt make it. We all saw his life leave him that day. We saw the van a little down the highway after the back smashed in as if it was hit by a semi not a human body. There were kids crying in the back. Just heartbreaking and terrifying. Good for you Brendan. You reminded me of my dad (who’s no longer here) I hope you are okay, man. That stuff is hard to watch, comprehend, etc. yours is even more extreme and I can’t believe you had to but continue to be this good man and thank you for sharing, brother.
Imagine raising 30k for a funeral and not thinking about the kids first
Yeah he’s so incredible… that’s why he had to expose that poor kid who this happened to, and “tell his story” on his fucking podcast.
He's gonna talk about this shit all the time now.
You saved those kids bro👌🏼
😮
Salute to you Brendan. RIP to the mother ❤🙏
Respect
Horrible person to do something like that.
Keeping this fam and Big Brown in my prayers tonight 🙏.
Brendan your a great man and honestly your a hero to those baby’s good shit brother
Goodshyt dude.   Much respect.
Shapel...it's time to remove yourself. You slow down the show to have things explained to you too often.
How can you be mad at yourself man for helping those kids what if that was your wife laying in the seat and your kids alone with there dead mother. The fact that you thought about yourself in that moment said alot about you.
Damn Brendan!  I'm sorry you had to witness that,  but also thank God you were there to help those poor kids out!  You're doing good work my dude! 😁🤙
Brendan is a good guy!!! Anyone else would’ve just kept on going
Is Brian officially back?
It’s called diesel fuel not gas 🤣
Wow. Schaub a real one.
Much love and respect brendan..what a man
Good thing Brendan mentioned the kid was out of shape
Only started liking him when he took rogans advice.. #respect.. He saved those boys
Awesome. Everyday heroes!
Brendan is a boss. I never understood the petty hate people throw at this guy! He has a heart of gold. Not only did he put himself at risk for this family but he’s going to help pay for the services and raise money for these kids. This isn’t the first time Brendan has done this. Does anyone remember Rat Borgs story with his son and all the medical problems he was having with his son. Brendan does t even know the guy and offers to cover the medical expensive. This is the def of a human being that deserves what he’s worked for and through it all he’s the first one to reach in his pockets to help others. So think about that shit when you talk shit. Good job Brendan! Your a fucking G . Forever a fan!
I retract everything I've ever said about Brendan Shaub and I hate that guy. The man's a fucking hero. I am a lesser man.
That hat is elite
Big up Big Brown Fucking respect
This is a wonderful exhibition of inherent human goodwill. We all have fights of our own but it’s amazing to see everything be put on hold for the purpose good. While the kids might have a hard filling the void, I’m sure help will be accessible. They will be alright. Never mind the belt never mind the notoriety; Brendan Schaub is champion of an entity that cannot be defended. Happy for people like you Mr.Schaub. Thank you on the behalf of fight fans on the behalf of the kids on the behalf of humanity. Thank you.
You’re a fucking badass too Schaub, even in the slight moment amidst all the chaos surrounding those kids you were their glimmer of hope, and though it may not seem that way now or in that moment, you made such in impact on them and their futures. I tip my hat to you. We got show the youth what real men are cuz it’s a character near extinct, but you did it that day. ❤️🤜🏼🤛🏼
A true man defends on instinct, ya can’t be mad brother cause you set an example for who else saw that tough ass shit. And them kids bro, you just became their favorite super hero. And their gonna grow up always remembering what you did and more than likely will probably save someone’s else kid one day.
I love you Brendan.
What complete scum are the people that disliked this video???
hero
God bless you bro ♥️
No matter how many dumb stuff brendan can say or do,he isnt a bad guy whatsoever,respect to the fullest🔥
What a fucking hero man! He said he’s no captain America but idk. What he did feels pretty close to it.
The gofund me ended at a little over $70,600. Thats pretty cool to see.
God damn that’s so sad 😥😥 Brendan is a hero for saving them ❤️
Teared up hearing this story ngl. Respect ❤️
Respect to Brendan Schaub! 🇮🇪
Respect well n truly earned. I pray for those children
Bs
Brendan is legit. You did great.
HERO
Born a fighter in every term of the meaning !
Moments like this you find what you're made of. This will be the worst day of these kids lives and they'll never forget you Brendan
Crying in the club rn
Much respect to Brendan. Great human being
Can’t not be a fan of him now
That is exactly what to do you always try to save the kids brenadan your the man
Ohh shit they’re back ...nice to see brendan man ...these cancel culture is really a cancer to society
I'm a diehard Brendan fan I'm always defending him in Reddit it may be easier now
This is so intense
Everybody does not deserve a fucking family. Fuck that guy! Fuck that guy! I hope those kids grow up to be fucking warriors. Stories like this hurt me so much. Being a hero doesn't mean being the strongest guy it just means being the bravest guy. Always been a big Brandon Scaub fan for these exact reasons.
Fuckin hero
Respect Brendan!!
May God bless you my brotha....ive been in a similar situation and it did traumatize me for a long time. .. God bless the families as well🙏🙏
My respects to you, my guy!  You did a good thing.  I pray Gods peace over you mind, body and soul.  AMEN
Awesome job Brendan
You will live with it forever. Great job in doing what you could for those kids. God bless.
I could always tell Schaub was a good person. Damm dude. Gnarly stuff.
After Callen gets locked up in prison for his sex crimes Brendan and Steve Rannazzisi should do a podcast together, they are both LIARS. This story is completely FAKE!!!!
this dude comedy ain’t for me but you have to respect his actions. i damn near almost teared up.
I'm shook after hearing this...  Props to you for helping the kids.
respect
I always knew Brendan was bad ass but he sure does have a good heart. Love you B
Straight up, where's all the Brendan haters now.
Brendan Schaub is a fucking hero.
Diesel not gas
Out of shape kid 😭🤣
Best of luck processing that experience! You’re brave, heroic even. Never change.
Holy shit dude
Brendan your a good guy bud
Brendan you’re the man. Respectfully, find and talk to someone that deals in crisis situations for you to talk to
🥲😭😭😭 fucken hero!
Much respect Brendan i cant even think how crazy that situation is…
We all hope we can do what Brendan did in that moment. Sadly, few can. All respect to the man, THAT'S a hero...
good shit brendan 🤍
Brendan is a real human being and I feel for him when he said he wishes he knew how much of a piece of shit the father was for obvious reasons but I also feel i could hear his voice almost break more than once recounting this it's hit him emotionally quite hard , I thought that he was close to crying more than once during this vid
Jesus Christ
Brandon I watch your show from time to time for what you are doing I hope there’s a lot of blessings in your life not enough people like you in this world
Brendan youre brave and a bad ass. Im proud of you. Rip amy
u might be a crap comedian but you are a total legend of a human being.
Thank you Brendan.
Big respect to Brendan for saving those kids. Takes a lot of courage & bravery to run into an accident site and save people. Most of us are just shocked at seeing something like this.
Say what you want about Brendan but the man has a heart of gold.
May God continue to bless you and your family Brendan Shaub damn I could only imagine what you would have done if you would have known that he was trying to do that to his family. Khabib voice: I want to change his FACE
Been a fan of Brendan forever those kids will remember his act of kindness and selflessness and bravery that day god speed brother
Brendan ur the fukn man!
Holy...
CTE or not, that was some straight heroic shit, good on him
All these bitter losers on here, trying to save face. No one cares that you "respect" Brendan now. Check yourself.
heros work, but still a big racist
The impact of what Brendan did moves mountains. Being a proactive bystander in major incidents like this is so important and hopefully, this inspires others to follow suit. Such a tragic story of loss, but those children and their family will be forever grateful.
Wow.. He is no longer in UFC but he managed to get the real life BMF title
Always respected Brenden
Schwab earned his respect for this one
The perfect story would of been if the dad was the only one that died in his stupid plan to go to heaven. And then he ends up in hell.
Damn thicc boy. Way to go
"I see a guy with no shoes on, he's like a wife beater kinda like an out of shape Mexican"
We make fun of him, but Brendan is a legit dude!
waiting for the news story. i heard cops pulled them out but we will see.
There goes my hero. Watch him as he goes!!
Your a real one B Schaub
Straight up dude handle it 💯 correct, respect B. Overall a very sad situation. Guys always remember being kind to strangers; we never know what people might be going through. I hope these kids stick together and everyone show them love. Lost their mom and family just like that. 😥
Shaub, you're one hell of a dude. We're thinking about those kids but I hope you're okay after what you saw.
Good work B
Have my respect forever
I get messed up flash backs. We are all heroes when the the time comes. Trust me.
Respects Brandan. You are the hope we need in the world now a days. Thank you for sharing and caring. God Bless you brother. Would be an honor to meet you some day. Please send my best wishes to your wife and kids as well for your their support and consideration for what you did. You wife is an amazing women, do not forget that. For peace of mind, you FLICKEN did something Brandan, now a days 99.99% of the people in this world would NOT had stopped. You DID, give yourself that please. You are my Hero Brandan, Thank you Thank you
Brendan your a hero bravo sir bravo 👏
Brendan's the man!
Amazing, what a hero.
Much respect brendan
Cold chills!
I m a dad and you make me cry man only by hearing the sad story  The gofundme is closed  😢
Good job Brendan. You did good. You did really really good.
😢 Brendan got a big heart man what a legend true hero ❤️
As someone who survived two horrific car accidents as a child, I just want to say thank you to Brendan. What you did for those kids in that moment means everything. Thank you for being one of the few people who actually did something in that moment to help those kids.
This dudes a g hands down mad respect Bryan
It’s pretty awkward the way Brendan only talks to callen
Schaub became the actual goat
I'll donate for the kids
Yo Brendan, get some photos of the mum through her life, it will help forget the last image you saw of her, helped me man. Much respect dude
Respect.
That Indians hat🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Schaub, a legitimate hero, that’s a unique human
Respect to Brendan for this.
Man I’m crying watching this.
I miss the old guy, where he go? Why he leave? Fuckin Goldberg’s sucks now without him
Why dislike this shame on you
I hope Brendan can find some solace that he literally saved the children's lives. Anything could have happened if Brendan didn't stop. Brendan is a legitimate hero.
Well done Schaub! Just checked the GoFundMe was closed at 70k. I wish the kids all the best.
Respect bschaub
OMG. Im a grown arse man and this had me in tears. Your a brave man Bredon. You should be so so proud of yourself.
🙏🙏👏👏
Wow ⚡️⚡️
Love that Terrible Tornado shirt
Brendan is a fucking hero 👏
Shapel just sitting there as B tells Bry the story. His days are few.  Go to Maliks pod
Bad dude Brendan.
Brendan: I’m not like Captain America  Me: I beg to differ
Hero shit man seriously
I can't help but think maybe that dad was going to pull those kids infront of a car with him or hurt kill them someway but you may have scared him off to where he didn't get a chance to hurt them further. You did an amazing thing and I would hope anyone would do the same in that situation.  I understand it's dangerous but those are kids man. And I can't believe the lady you're with told you to just not help. I really can't imagine.
Goddamn this is heartbreaking
Great respect to Brendan 🙏🏼
Wow thats such a sad story bit good job Brendan for helping them out words cant describe how honorable that it. Mad props to lil man who waved B down for help. Man that's such a bummer
Respect
Just WOW...Love you man
Good for you Brando. Also, diesel fuel has a super low ignite point, so it being all over the place wasn’t too big of An issue. No one would be thinking about that in the heat of the moment but.
Anyone in a situation like this let people know. Let me know. Well be there and nothing else matters.
This is so real of him it’s crazy
I have to like Brendan now, how frustrating. Heroic, great morals and happy you can help them kids.
I think this is why I have never shat on Brendan. Ok he isn't the greatest comedian of all times but he has always seem like a good dude. And obviously the UFC fighter becomes a real life super hero when the shiit hits the fan.
“Then I heard the voice of the lord say|whom shall I send? | Who will go for us. | and I said “here am I lord, send me.” Isaiah 6:8
If not you who? If not now when? - Beautiful sentiment and a beautiful human being - Thank you Brendan
Damn this could be a start to a great movie, very heroic, props to schaub.such a sad situation:(
You are a GOOD man B!!
That was rough to watch sheesh
Nice hat though they fuckn up my team
You are a hero Brendan. Praying for you buddy, that was a traumatic experience to be apart of.
His wife said keep going tho??? Lol
Damn
Hero. Legend!
hero
Damn, Rest In Peace.
unbelievable schaub, you are the man.
You can hate on him for dressing like a f#ckboy, his stand up and all the other things he gets slated for. But let's all recognise him for this. Mans a legend. Well done Mr Schaub Big love to the young boys you saved.
The word hero is overused in today’s society , yet ….. this guy is a HERO !!
God bless Schaub
Brendan, all the love and respect to you my man! you done an incredibly brave thing and literally SAVED lives! my heart goes out to those kids
This is the best thing that could’ve happened to Schaub. Now he has something people want to hear him talk about.
Brendan is actually a really good person. I'm not surprised at all he did this. In the past he helped pay for a big surgery, for a child of a UFC fighter. I don't think Brendan even knew the fighter that well.
Fuck that was crazy
I’ve shit on Brendans vast lack of comedic skills and I will continue to do so, but props Brendan you’re a good dude at heart.
✝️🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
What a heroic act, he could have drove past like most other ppl probably would have 😔 he’s clearly still suffering from what he saw that day
Mad respect schaub! 👊🏽 🇬🇧
I love Brendan always have. Big fan from when he was fighting, know people tease him for his comedy although sometimes I find him funny but all that aside he's a fucking great guy and hero. Thank you Brendan for being the great man you are. This story was very emotional for me.
PRAY for these KIDS, I hope they end up in good homes.
Hero right there
Brendan is a good man
Damn Brendan, I respect the hell out of you for doing what you did.
She was a smoke show too
I can't believe have given this video a thumbs down,  wtf? Brendan saved 3 kids that could of died in an explosion.  Be proud of yourself Brendan you've done a selfless act of kindness. You're a her mate.
They need to reopen the donation page. Brendan is the man.
Good thing he ignored his wife
Callen sitting there wishing it was him that rescued those kids
Holy shit Brendan.
Good job but you don’t need to worry about an 18-wheeler leaking fuel. Diesel is very hard to ignite.
Brendan offers to pay for the Funeral: *Everyone Liked That*
Mad respect to Schaub. Great human being.
They raised $70k for that woman. Now they can give her a beautiful service that she deserves and then some. God be with those kids and God bless Brendan for that selfless act.
Lump in my throat with this.
Love Brendan for this
What a fucking hero, respect man
🙏🏼💯
i'm never making fun of brendan schaub again.... this guy is a real hero.
Just keep going imagine that’s your wife lol
Much respect Brendan. You’re a great guy man.
Officially never clowning on this absolute unit ever again 🖤
Bro I was never really a fan of Brendan, but man I now have another level of respect for him
Much respect for what he did ....hes still not funny though...gotta keep it honest.....hes not a funny comedian. But atleast hes good at being a person
Holy shit this was all over my local news! God bless him man
The stress and pain you feel is what you saved the kids from … as bad as it sounds it much better that you deal with it then them. Big props for helping them and avoiding some of the pain that they would have felt by seeing that shit
Respect man. You’re truly an amazing person
Good guy Schuab
Respect Brandon dam I'm truck driver and this happens alot more then people think fukn horrible
Damn. His comedy still sucks but that’s a super selfless act. Good on Schaub
Fuck!!!! That story is crazy. Can't imagine seeing the mom like Brendan described
How can this have dislikes
Those poor, innocent kids. And not for nothing, poor Shaub. When you see shit like that, it never leaves you. B is a hero
Brandon is a saint man what an act that’s some hero shit right there
Touching man...just touching. Thanks for your heart
I applaud you Brendan 👏
Bless you Schaub
Fucking hell
I’m a Brendan Schaub fan for life.
Not all heroes wear capes. Sometimes they have cauliflower ears
Say what you want to about Brendan, he’s a hero in my book. Respect🙏
One of my best friends growing up his dad was a tow truck driver had his own business. He would take us on calls sometimes. He brought us when we were 15 to a call where a lady had been drinking and driving and crashed into another vehicle with a family in it. The drunk lady wasn’t wearing a seatbelt and her head was smashed into the windshield. His dad had us both look so we would be so scared of drunk driving that we would never do it. It worked I’ve never done it and I don’t drink at all.
Nice work my man!!
respect to brendan
Thank you for what you did Brendan.  This a a true showing of your character and heart.  I will donors the go fund me, and any other fundraisers you promote for the family.
Much props to Brendan 🙏🏼💯
Some of you might not like Schuab for whatever reasons you tell yourself. But he’s got a heart of gold and he did more than most people would in that situation.
God bless them, and good on your Brendan true man ✊
Dam gave me goose bumps insane
Is this legit?? Jesus
Who are the 90 pieces of human garbage that gave a thumbs down on this, the psycho dads friends?  Ffs.
Not Captain America Big B. You're a real hero.
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿
All the respect in the world, to Brendan, not a lot of people would do that.
Shaun, you keep working on your comedy. As a Man you are great. I have so much respect for you.
God bless you ! 🙏
To many people forget that athletes are people too. Way to become a hero to those kids.
I will never talk shit about you EVER AGAIN!! RESPECT!!
Dope! But come on, some stuff doest always need to be made public. Brendan, this is why you get all the hate, similar to the Ray Borg thing and other stuff. Some stuff may seem like an amazing story but dude... come on. But legit, good on you for real. them kids are lucky you were there.
Brendan your a Bad Ass! Everything happens for a reason! You are an Amazing Man..
God bless Brendan. Hope he doesnt have any trauma issues
Keep those kids in your life. Stick around, show up every now & then. Annually, if not more often. This is what it means to be a role model, what serving your community truly means. They need a father figure now, MORE than ever. They will NEVER forget you. Show up to the funeral bc you're a Tio now, Brendan 💙✊🏽💯 C'est la vie.
This is why it bothers me when people hate on Brendan so much. Whatever about his comedy or career; I used to hate on him too but a long time ago I realized the dude's a really good, generous, and caring guy. I'd rather have him in my corner any day then Bryan or Any other Comedian/Podcaster...
You the man Schaub
I'm fukin crying bro!!
You are an angel to those kids brother
GOOD STUFF BRENDA!! THANK GOD YOU WERE THERE. THANKS TO YOUR WIFE TOO.
🖕86 who disliked this! Good 👍 on you Big Brown!
Brenden, welcome to learning you are a good man. God called you to answer that child’s cry and you chose the right path. Your family is safe. The children are physically safe. Follow through with helping the children. Use your platform to raise money that the kids can use in their future and not be stolen by relatives such as a trust. This is why you were chosen to be the one on scene. You posses the courage, humility, and love needed of a true man. Be at peace, you can only do so much, and do not allow anxiety or 20/20 regrets to fool your good judgment. Do not be angry with your wife, I’ve rarely encountered a woman partner who encourages self sacrifice in situations like these. She is simply programmed to care for her own it is not necessarily a negative that her needs are different. It’s normal, people panic. Yes you left, but you tried to balance your needs with the needs of others and there is no shame in this. The woman who helped you was also called at the right time. Death is hard, explicit death is even harder because of the visual impact of our morality on display. I don’t know you, but I am proud of you young man. Peace be with you.
Always loved ya B. Been in a similar situation. Good on you Brother 💪🏻
I know Brendan was talking about getting counseling for the kids but he should also take that up as well. It’s not good to have those things crawling around in your psyche.
I sobbed for about half a second very early in the video and caught myself. If you compare this to Jussie Smollet or claim that he’s exaggerating for clout you’re lying to yourself and need to look in the mirror. You don’t have to call him a hero to admit this was a heroic act that should be commended. For once, either because of his CTE or despite it, he served the community in a way that few could, and even fewer would. Give this man his due respect!
Hats off to you Brendan, 💯 Respect!
Wow god bless you Brendan 🙏
Never liked schaub. I now will never not like him.
Brendan I know you don’t know me but you’re a legit real world hero, feels strange to say this to a celebrity/stranger but I’m really proud of you. This story has restored some of my faith in our species, thank you for what you’ve done for the human race within this situation and take good care of your health as you have done a very brave and commendable thing. Thank you sir
Sounds like she might have been dead before they got in the car.
Fucking Brendan man ❤️
He didn’t had to stop and help, like he said he was with he’s family, but that just shows how great of a soul Brendan has. Respect
Used to hate on Schaub but this is different. Great job Schaub you're the man, saving kids without regard to your own safety now that's heroic
Brendon is a real man for the way he handled those kids. Those kids will never forget him, if there is any way for him to get to see those kids it will help a little. For what B. Saw he will never forget it but there is ways to help work out what to do next.
Fucking weirdos everywhere keep saying Brendan lied about this like wtf. In the picture that has been circulating you can even see the blanket over the passenger side of the vehicle like he said and on top of that he has 0 reason to make this up as there were probably dozens of witnesses..
You are incredible person.I am so sorry  You had to experience this
always respected brendan. mad respect
Mad respect for you Brendan. Youre a giant and supposed to be there. Get those boys involved in the years to come. At your gym or with trainers or something. They are going to have terrible demons.
TFATK is still a podcast?!  cool :)
The world needs more people like Brendan, that's truly heroic.
Brendan well done sir
Jesus christ , what a situation to come across , fair fucking play Brendan , 100 percent you saved the kids lives and should be proud .
Dam bro...dam..do your best too help raise them..god bless you guys
Respect Brendan !
Respect ✊🏽
There’s a lot of people who hate themselves in the comment section
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Damn that’s hard. Life is real.
Nice work Brendon. You are a force for good in this world. 👍
🧢🧢🧢
Out of all of Joe Rogans buddies I’ve watched over the years when they’re watching fights I always knew Brendan was one of the rare good guys you’ll see or watch. This video cemented my thoughts on that… 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Fuckin love you B❤️❤️🙏🙏🥺
Should set separate funds up for each kid. Where they can’t have it until they’re a certain age for school, or a car maybe a house payment.
I’m praying for everyone involved, including Schaub because I can only imagine how traumatizing that truly is for everyone
A lot of guys hate on Brendan but hes a fkn good guy! Such a fkn sad story poor kids hope that father gets fkd up inside fkn coward
Shaubs always been a solid dood so this act of kindness does not surprise me
Just crying man
I joke around about Schaub a lot but damn he’s a good dude, I don’t think I’d of been brave enough to do this, but who knows in the moment what ur capable of. He’s a good man for paying for the funeral and helping out the children.
We can make jokes about Brendan and he may not the the “smartest tool in the shed” as he once put it but the man is brave and good.
Thank you Brendan!!!!
Mad respect.
I cant stand Brendan Schaub and the reasons why are a list a mile long. After this story and the fact he did this I cant not help but say the mans a hero. He is simply a hero here. The dude did what I admit I wouldn't be able to do. For one Im not a beast like he is, and two Im like those regular donks that just keep moving on. Brendan may be a poop comedian but the mans got bigger balls than I do thats for damn sure. Good job Schaub. That was painful
Horrific 😔 Praying to Jesus for these kids.
We joke on him alot but Bubba really does have a heart of gold
Good man schaub
Schaub got me in tears listening to this...
Wow.....I can't stop crying bro.... What the fuck is wrong with people...dammit man... I'm sitting here listening to your story...BRAVE MAN BRENDAN. What more can I say
WAY TO BE A FUCKING HERO SCHAUB.. MASSIVE AMOUNT OF RESPECT TO YOU BRO.. I HOPE YOU YOUR DOING OK MAN
Now nobody is gonna hate this guy.
That’s some real hero shit big dawg…. Brendan showing real heart and compassion.
Brendan said “I’m not Captain America”: Well, if what he did—doesn’t make you a Superhero, then I don’t know what does.
Brendan is a hero idgaf what y'all say
Guy seems like such a toolbag on the surface, but is as pure of a person that you can get. Good fucking work
Welldone big man❤
You are a hero Brandon 🙌🙌🙌  respect man
Hero.
God’s soldier blessed
I was in a sea of gas but I was running so it smelled like gas 😂
Schaub. Man. You did a good thing. 🙏🏼🙏🏼
Not only is Brendan a hero but because of his platform, he’s gonna be able to help those kids even more! Good work B!
This might have saved schaubs career
The hatred those boys will have toward their father as they come of age.. I can’t even fathom.. prayers out to those little fellas man.. hope their healing begins sooner than later & RIP to their mama 🕊
Ur a hero Brendan u don’t know me but I’m so proud
Schaub just became the man.
Salute to Mr. Schaub
YOUR A HERO
Of course leave it to some loser to try and kill his beautiful family..
You are a good man big brown. Huge respect for helping.
Respect Due !
Shaub has a huge PP
Respect big brown. Great man
Good job schaub
Respect
Jesus Christ, awesome job, big respect.
omg so terrible.  good on you Brendan
I wonder how credible the reports that he was never there and that the lafd was the ones that removed the kids from the vehicle and Brendan was not on the scene. I'm going to keep track about it just because I'm curious now lol
Jesus Brendan.... god bless man....
Will never make a Brandon joke again👍
To the homeless cats who believe they have found shelter in bapas arms… YOU WILL BE BACK, B.
Ok I’m usually hating on this dude, But bless him man this was selfless and heroic.
Schaub is a hero. Real one for sure
Thank you Brendan
Way to Brendan 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
you the man.
Lord heal those children and keep them safe. Let us all react in that manner. Good job B
mf'n gangsta!  idk how u held it together telling that story bro..bless u and the family 😔
Legend
God bless you big brown! You’re not a hero, you’re those kids angel!
Thank god you were there Brendan thank GOD!🙏🏿🥺 Phil Defranco brought me here. I believe nothing is coincidence you were meant to save those babies I'm so happy you didn't just keep going. I'm donating to the gofundme and let us know how to help the babies.❤
Man these things happen every single day. Prayers to anyone going thru domestic abuse.
Well done Brendan 👏👏👏👏
Godbless you're safe. Sending love to those kids... oufff
I see a lot of critics of dude since he was doing stuff on Joe Rogan . You can say whatever you want but i always liked him, just a fucking angel man
While Schaub may not be a great stand up comedian, he is a great entertainer and his podcasts are funny / silly . He has always come across as a stand up guy, the Ray Borg situation was amazing and he clearly isn’t telling this story for clout. Hats of to Brendan for stepping in when many others would of just walked on by. What a brave human being for stepping in and he’s still clearly emotionally disturbed by it. Hats off to BS, much respect from a fan in the UK
As much as I give Brendan shit, he's a real one for this l.
smash
First Class Brendan!
Good man Brendan 👏
Teared up watching this, thank God for a man like Brendan!!
I drove by that accident going north on the 101
What a story...godbless.  On another note, anyone know what what he's wearing?
Jesus that’s horrible wow I can’t imagine thank god someone like Brendan was there
Brendan Schaub just made himself the new MMA GOAT
I fuckin  love Brendan. He brought tears to my eyes. Big ups ALL OF THE THUMBS UP TO THIS HERO! 🙏 🙏 ❤
Hero
I fucking love Schaub
Coming up on a scene with kids and violent traumatic death is rough. Especially rough when it is not something you are 'familiar' with. People in emergency services, who go to these scenes repeatedly and have deal with such horrors are kind of special in that way. Brendan was just trying to go to dinner. There will be lots of what-if's that go through his head for a long time, but he made the right decisions and that helps with those what-ifs.
Not all heroes wear capes
Your a legend brother,
Good man. You were relatively safe around that gas since it was diesel.
Sad people really want go around calling him a liar smh
Well done Brendan dude top guy.
Youre my f*cking hero, Schaub! Good man
You are the hero of the week Brendan
Let's all forget about the allegations against these creeps because they talked about a car accident. Right.
Alright no more hating on Brendan. Much respect sir
Some people are built for it, most arent. We see you brother👁
If I never seen Shaub’s face or heard another word come out of his mouth, I would actually believe justice exists. The WORST. Love ya Brian.
Holy shit. You're a hero. I cried on my lunch break. Great job man.
Brendan thank you for saving and helping the kids!
Jesus fuck Brendan is such a good guy I was tearing up hearing him talking about it
Mad Respect. I’ve been on Fence even have poked Fun at Brendans talents etc. But? that’s over. When the opportunity came?he didn’t run from the Fire he ran into it. Until that happens to u you don’t know if your a bitch or a Man. Brendan Passed that test.
Love you Brendan. Total G.
I hope schaub talks to a professional about this.
Brendon may be a idiot and I may give him a hard time but he is a good dude. Much respect for his actions..
Unimaginable.
I've always been a fan of Schaub I cheered for him in the ufc, laughed with him the past few years! Iv'e even slept with him talking in my ear listening to his podcasts! But he has never made me cry! He is the goat in my opinion! Not many can do it all and still be a hero!
Brendan definitely needs to got to therapy after seeing something that traumatic. My old lady and me drove up on a accident on December 20, 2019 where a 11yo boy got hit by a car on the highway. She did compressions and I gave him breaths off and on for 20 minutes while waiting for EMT's. He got airlifted to the mayo clinic, and was stabilized early the next morning. The next day he started seizing and was put back on life support. 8 days after the accident he was pronounced brain dead and pull off life support. We went to a the accident debriefing with the police, EMT's, and fire department. Everyone poured their guts out, cried, and talked each other through the experience. We felt uncomfortable expressing our emotions to people that we barely know and didn't let it all out at the debriefing. Two and a half years later we're both still having nightmares, and are fucked in the head from not talking about it. Traumatic events never go away and you can never forget them. The best thing that you can do is talk about it and learn to cope. The sooner that you offload your emotions, the less likely you'll be to develop PTSD in the future.
I'm really proud of Mr Schaub. That man was raised properly. Jesus.  I can only hope our unspoken social contract with the incarcerated "Harm those who harm kids" Is enforced on the Sperm donor coward, who left his kids to die.
Respect
I cannot wrap my mind around how that man didn't die.  That is insane, after the head on crash and getting hit by a car at freeway speeds.. That's unreal....  hearing that just F***ed me up, how is that possible. One of my best friends purposfully ran infront of a pickup doing ~45, went up into the air, and was dead before he hit the ground. It was over a ridiculous argument about beer. He was a very impulsive kid, 15 at the time but looked more like 21 year old.  his older (but smaller) brother was holding him back from running into the road but he squirmed loose and said "F**** you guys" running at the truck with his arms up.   But this man f***ing survived what the actual F***
We're never making fun of Shaub again
I'm a pretty stoic guy.  I didn't cry when my Dad passed this January.  I have three kids, though, and was sobbing halfway through this story.
What kind of car were they in?  This dude tried to kill everyone and failed.. this must be a safe car
Atta boy Schaub. No words to describe your actions. Selfless act knowing you have kids of your own. Thank you!
This is just fucking sad. Props for this, man
Your a Good Guy Brendan! Anyone that ever says otherwise, send em to this video. I’d love to see you and that Dad locked in a room for an hour! I’ll be donating what I can!❤️❤️
Great job and all good citizen, but why wouldn’t u hang around look after the kids u leave 3 kids with one woman and a truckie, I’m sure ya missus could of driven off the hwy and be safe etc… strange reaction!! But all in all good job!!!
God bless you man!
Don't care what he did...still a douche
I feel you man
Everyone always clowns on him but he's always seemed like a decent guy. Turns out he's more than that...He's a hero💪
Heartbreaking . Brendan your a gd dude man ! 🙏
The fact people have to question whether this is true or false should tell you everything
Brendan please take care of yourself as well, it seems like he hasn't been sleeping well, I'm sure a scene so traumatizing like that happening all so suddenly is something nobody should ever have to deal with so instantly.
Man I Never Understood Thishate This Man Gets Yea Sometimes He Has Shitty Takes But This Just Made Me Have A New Found Respect Goid Shit Shauby
Let's hope these kids get all the support they need
How did he get to the car before the truck driver? He loves building up his part in this story for sure, he made his part sound like something from Bourne...
This is heartbreaking
Yeah he's obviously a good guy he's still not funny tho
RESPECT ....Thats a traumatic story, I hope those kids get to grow up knowing they are loved
Well, i used to love brendan and then got mad at him over the snitch stream schaub thing when he told on the website. That is so petty to real life things. I will support this guy forever… Great job my guy, you are a hero and a real one. Now, i see it more than ever.
You are a bad ass Brendan. Thanks.
Fuuuuuuck man. I got frogs in my throat
❤️❤️
Respect to u b showerszz..but  id like to think that we (all men reading this) would do the same . Good shit Brendan!
Wow
Brendans shoes are 🔥
Heart Breaking story
B-Rad is my hero 👏👏👏
I’m a Brendan fan now! As a father this hits hard, and as someone who mother was murdered by a drunk driver. This is woah.
God Bless you B
Jesus christ the chief wahoo hat lol
Brain matter everywhere? Was she shot in the head ?
To be able to move and think in time of chaos  Is a gift  You’re a hero B
is he a real one tho? cause the details from the news and any other source are different from what he says
Good job Brendan. You did the right thing.
hopefully brendan gets someone to talk to  this is gonna have a long lasting ptsd effect
He’s a good man
Schaub wtf man. I haven't cried in a long time before this.
Brendan, You did good !!!!
I just gained SO much respect for Brendan. good on ya mate.
Good on you Brendan!!!!
Brendan is Hero!! Put some respect on his name!! He can be a lunkhead but he has a good heart.. God knows how long that kid was on the car and he stepped up!!
Good on you Brendan
God damn man. Cryin this early in the am. Hats off to you tho man. Such a good dude for helping.
Brendan's a hero. Not Captain America my ass.
Fuck man, that eats the soul. He handled this incredibly well. Big ups to B.
Got to respect the fact that Brendan treated those 4 stranded kids like they were his own. Imagine if that stupid ass father got to those kids before Brendan helped them. Man, what a real tragedy. Thank goodness for Brendan getting them out of the way.
Thanku Brendan, we all know ppl jus like to break ur balls, Thanku for helping those kids🙏💯
I usually give Brendan stick but damn man if you have anything negative to say about him or this AS A PERSON, i’d have to question you now. Dammit man.
Great guy. Heroo move
It wasn’t a coincidence that Brendan was the one to be there. Hopefully he can help out those kids. 😢
I always thought Brendan was one of the good guys. You can tell by listening to him talk he’s a cool dude and cares a lot. This is just heroic. There’s not really any other way to put it but that. I know it’s probably hard right now dealing with what you saw but eventually you will realize just how great what you done was. You saved those kids. You’re a fucking hero man!
Wild story good for you Brendan
You look like a mechanic from Nordstrom Rack that runs towards accidents.  Good on ya, Big Brown.
Sucks that the man has tbi from fighting and now he’s gonna have ptsd on top of that.
Powerful
I came upon a motorcycle accident once. The man was on fire. I had to put him out. I will never forget the smell or the way his cooked body looked. He died. But the main thing that stuck with me was how much he loved his wife because he just kept screaming her name and saying "my wife!!!".
You sir have earned my respect. God bless you!
That’s why you never ridicule a family man, a man who provides for his family, a man who works hard to get what he wants. Those men are honorable men
Good Man!
Brendan you did the right thing
The only thing that bothers me is his wife said just keep going she’s a self centered person.
It's diesel fuel & it's non flammable, only combusts  in the engine!
Good stuff Brendan. You might have trouble sleeping right now, but regret is worse. You'll be glad you did that until the day you die.
Yeah I  respect the he'll out of Schaub. Running thru a pool of gas to save the kids.. fucking hero
Truly amazing job Brendan 👏!! You could have kept driving but you stopped and helped shows the heart you have. Great guy!
Salute
That’s crazy
Well done sir
Im not a fan man, but mad respect to Brendan! 👍
God bless you brother
Boring
Weird to put funeral costs and not cost to raise kids as main driver of go fund me
Can I still make fun of schaub??
You’re a real man Brendan. Thank you for what you did true hero
HEEEAAVVYYYY
I can't even hear any of this story with that incredible racists hat
God bless you Brendan
brandon kinda always sucked but he is the mO fo man from this day forward. good job bro.
You’re a great dude, Brendan
I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his comedy chops—Éomer
Being brave means knowing that when you fail, you don’t fail forever.
Nice hat
Much respect
What an incredible act of heroism, every man would like to think they’d do something similar but that takes a special kind of bravery and selflessness
Damn, hope Brendan also recovers from this as well. Seeing stuff like that in real life is no joke, can really mess someone up mentally seeing jarring imagery like that and experiencing seeing such levels of gore.
Gained a hell of a lot respect for Brendan today
love you big brown, your story got me teary eyed real good. Love you bro
Damn... Schaub... well done. you are a good dude
Get some therapy, B. ♥️ you did a good thing now you need to heal from that horrific shit.
Who the fuck are the 66 people to give this video a thumbs down.. something is wrong with you all.   Man, Brandon you probably saved 3 young children’s lives! And to then go on to arrange support for funeral costs and support for the family.. that’s something to be proud of!  Well done dude ! 👏🏻
I just read this on TMZ this morning. Nice work man. Not a lot of people that have your amount of success and status would even get their shoes dirty to help someone.
Leave that girl
Well done Sir
You’re a great man Schaub 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Everyone go donate. Let's give those kids as much money as possible
What a legend!
Not the biggest Shaub fan but I have much respect for his actions in this horrible situation
Holy crap. Never been a fan of Shaub but I sure as fk am now. He is a real hero and he deserves like a Purple heart or something for that. Bro you're a champion. To be able to act so fast and stay composed and protecting those kids both mentally and physically is fking inspiring. Brendan you're a Saint and those kids have a future because of you. Will always watch ur show from now on. Respect from the UK
So proud of you bro!
Wow just wow what a hero!! be kind to each other, love each other!
Raising money for those kids is a great thing. They will need it.  But who was asking for 30k for the funeral? My mom passed recently, full funeral, wake, the whole thing, was $11,000, we live in NJ.
Brendan showed those kids that not all men are total pieces of shits. I hope those kids grow up to be amazing people.
Just donated. Looks like a ton of people have based on the comments and amount so far. Props to Brendan!
This is a once in a lifetime event. God bless him for his bravery. Those kids will never forget the man who helped them in a dire time of need.
Good fucking shit Schaub. You may not have been a UFC champ but man you're a HERO!
Mad respect for Brendan Genuine dude. I feel for those kids man I have 2 little ones I can’t even imagine. 60 k on the gofundme that’s real cool y’all.
I respect this deeply.  Great job B
Brendan you are a hero. I’m not religious but god bless u man.
God bless Schaub
Mad respect brendan. God has a way of putting people in the right place at the right time. The things that couldve happened if you didnt stop..
Great job B!
Shit made me cry
"We're all going to heaven today"
I think that all of us like to think that we’d do the same thing but deep down a lot of people know that fear would overpower them in the moment and they couldn’t do it. This is a truly beautiful thing he did for those kids, I’m so sorry for that Mom to have lost her life because of that abusive piece of shit and it’s horrible those kids had to live through all of that. We need to raise money to help better those kids chances at having a great Life. Also props to the kid for getting on top of the car and waving them down, he saved his and his siblings Life that night too.
Thank you for helping Brendan! Respect!
Damn Brendan you're an actual hero man, even after pulling them out still looking to help.
Those kids will never forget the angel that rescued them from a demon! Thank you for sharing this story. I can’t imagine what you must be going through, let alone those kids!
he?
What a fantastic act of bravery. Well done. God put he right person in the right place 🙏
I take a lot of shots at Schaub, all jokes really, but taking no shots here, fucking bamf hero work here, nothing less.
Tough to listen to first thing in the morning
Respect!
God bless you and those children and the surving family. Saddening and Spirit put you there for a good reason. Your outreach will be impactful
His emotions are closer to the surface than my sweet mothers 😢
So Brendan thinks he’s Jordan Peterson?
Waterworks started as soon as the bigger kid said I don’t want to die. Mad respect man your there guardian angel
Protect Brendan Schaub at all costs. A true hero ✊ RIP to the mom
Imagine being such a piece of shit, you want to drive past them.
You're a hero bro
All love for Brendan and that poor family. String the fucker who did it up.
When b said he was proud of the kid and was brave I melted and lost. I've always loved you Brendan and now its an honour to share this world with you
Thank you Brandon
Damn that was rough I’m sorry bro
Brendan is usually doing or saying something worth valid criticism... But here... Here he's done something amazing and heroic  Spectacular job, Brendan
My God. I give. Brendan shit as much as anyone. Dude is a man’s man’s though. Thanks for saving those kids.
Brendan needs to keep talking about this and work through it. One love.
Mad respect Brendan, don’t ever regret doing something in a situation like that.
I met shaub at an airport in seattle.  Thought it was cool, BUT NOW im proud to have met him.  💪🏼🖤🙏🏼
Brendan, you're the man brother
Brendan schaub vs jacked Dana white? I'd pay for it.
There will be ZERO Brendan Schaub slander accepted from here on out. None. Zero.
You’re a badass Brenden. Incredible.
I cant sleep because of my own issues.. that has to be tough all around.. Fuck Yeah Brendan you do what you gotta do in the moment. Nothing but good intention and that shows your fucking heart. Fuck the Haters
I wasn't a massive fan of Brendan but your great human and a heart of a lion. Good man
Unreal Brendan. Real life Hero man ❤❤❤
Turns out brendan was lying
I don't like Schaub for the Hollywood wanna be persona that he took on... HOWEVER Schaub showed he is still a real 1 here. No true Holly'weirdo would ever risk themselves like that
YOU HELPED THOSE KIDS MORE THAN ONCE.. you’ve helped those kids for a life time not letting them see their poor mother!  So sorry you had to witness this but you was there for a reason.. you saved those kids!! Respect yo you brother I couldn’t imagine being so calm and making so many correct decisions in a state of panic. You’re the man!!
Dude, that's some heavy shit right there
Respect
I've always had respect for Brendan, this is just a whole new level, he's a hero 👏
Thank you for sharing your story, there a lot of people in this world effected by both sides of incidents like this. Thank you for opening up
When are we gonna find out if this is real or not
Send this to IN THE POCKET MMA's page!!!
Never talk shit about Brendan. He's a good guy.
I have a new found respect for Schaub. Truly a hero
Has Brendan had plastic surgery? He looks like he’s been stung by a buncha bees.
Sorry Brendan, I'm part of the groupie that Hates you no matter what cuz we're losers.
Hey I'm man enough to say he gets on my nerves at times but wow dude you're a hero should be more people out there like you total (RESPECT) and you will remember this the rest of your life but also remember you saved them kids 👍
i'm still gonna hate his comedy lol, but props to him saving the kids
Great job Brendan! Always help others
Respect❤
Well done Brendan, wish we had more like you. U earned my respect 👏🏼
I respect him a little more for wearing a chief wahoo hat.
lol this has just been proven completely false, Schaub lying out his fucking pants again with the most exaggeration ever. See the police reports
Massive credit to Brendan for this.
Wow. What a crazy situation to arrive first at
you are a true hero b I bet if u caught the dude he would definitely be I heaven pice of shit coward
As heart rending as it gets. Full respect and admiration. Hope he and the kids gets some counselling tho, will be needing to process that trauma.
Good on ya Shaub. So much respect for you and what you did. Unreal brother. God bless you! Fuckin-A.
Isaiah 6:8 "And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, 'Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?' To which I replied; 'Here am I, *send me* .' "
Jesus. Heard this on DeFranco. Good on you big brown. I don't know many people including myself who would have gotten out to help.
Well done man. You are a hero
BUBBA, WATER WEED DUNE HAIR?
I doth my cap to you sir.
I promise to laugh at some of Brendan's mundane jokes for this. Real champ Brendan.
Brendan "Superhero" Schaub. Mad Respect for his selfless action.
"Im not Captain America" - True, but Captain America isn't real and wouldn't have been there to save those kids. It isn't a "thank god", its a "thank Brendan". Huge respect.
Well done brendan that is amazing. Who the fuck disliked this story?????
Schaub you fucking legend
Donated 👍
Damn Schaub you’re the man
Hero
We love you big bro. You a real one 💯
What is CHP?
This made me tear up. So proud of you Brendan you’re inspiring, that fatherly instinct kicked in. Thank god you did what you did.
great jobb Brendan !!! i swear a tear came out
Well for sure respect him now. Still dont like him but i can respect him...
Brendan, that's some stand up stuff. A real hero!
Who the fuck is actually giving this a thumbs down? Yall need Jesus.
Wow sorry to hear you went through that Brendan, true hero shit mad respects, that takes true balls
U THE FUCKING MAN BRENDAN!!!!!!
Holy shit this is heartbreaking, mad respect for Brendan, absolute hero
What an insane story
Wow, This  shit is so fucking sad. :(
You the fking man bro, respect and Apologizes for trolling you here and there.
This is insane …. And so incredibly emotional
Brendan is a very kind man. Hopefully he looks after his own mental health after that experience too.
The donations TFATK watchers are contributing is amazing, go team
Remember guys, be a human being first. <3
I BETTER NOT HERE NO MORE DISRESPECT TO BRENDAN SCHAUB
Why why do the killer always survive. 😡
😭 poor children
Respect bro ❤️
I'm not a Brendan hater by any means, but NEVER again will I complain about Theo not being on KATS. Wow. What a fucking man.
I will never say a bad word about Brendan ever again. I never thought he was a bad guy, just a bit annoyed by all the dumb shit he says. That's over now. Absolutely heroic and also very tough to witness something like that.
Holy fuck, Brendan. Wow.
Brendan you're a true hero man. This world is lucky to have thiccy heroes like you B
Seriously all credit to him. That was an incredibly brave and heroic thing to do. Witnessing it all, being covered in gasoline then still choosing to save those kids. My one question is how was he able to tell his girlfriend that there was a CHILD on a car, that was clearly involved in a serious wreck and her response be “no just keep going”? Just keep going?!
honestly... I'm crying here. Wow Brendan... what an heroic act!!!
I Fucking hate Schaub and his opinions but fuck! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 I git nothing else to say. God will remeber what u did for those kids!
Just awesome brother!!!
Big ups to Brendan Schaub!!
All the respect in the world Brendan. Sorry for everyone in this terrible story. Except for that piece of shit dad I hope he lives in pain and regret for the rest of his life.
That’s a crazy story. Honestly a lot of people wouldn’t have stopped
Brendan is such a beautiful soul, such a big caring heart. He literally saved those kids lives and from alot more trauma having the mind to make sure they didn't see their mum like that. Comforting the kids, telling that one kid how proud he was of him for doing what he did. Then ontop of that, uses his spot he is in to get donations and donate himself to not only the funeral but towards a fund for those kids lives. I hope that 1, brendan gets some help for his trauma going through that and 2, people stop the bullshit hate on this guys character. He's really lucky to have someone like callen there for him, propping him up and making sure he understood that he did the right thing and that the world needs people like him in it. Never, ever change B.  All the love ❤
You think the father was on psychiatric prescriptions that made him flip?
That dad is an absolute scumbag. And also shows how much of a dangerous position Brendan was in with the dad still running around, he could of attacked him with a weapon. Not forgetting the other cars and gas etc. I've given him a lot of crap in the past but full respect Brendan.
*Good Job Schuab!!*
You're a hero bro. The world needs more people like you. Hope you're alright man and remember you did a brave, incredibly selfless thing.
I can't believe that there are individuals trying to besmirch Brendon's name in relation to this accident. Your sources are a reddit string? a goddamn reddit string?  Brendon you are a bonafide hero. Big up Big Brown. Top man.
Good shit Brendan. Must’ve been hard. Takes a real man, especially thinking about your kids and wife at the same time. Love how you took care of talking to the kids. Good fucking shit bro. Wish I could talk to you about this in person and salute you bro
Glad you didn’t get burned up brotha
BRRROOOOOOO... You legend!
you can see what’s inside someone’s heart when they act without thinkin… massive respect b. all my thoughts n love to those kids also. 💚
All the fake love Brandon is getting they will hate him tomorrow
Good shit Brendan ❤️ Fuck the people saying he’s lying - you’re brain dead
Brendan respect bro. What a real man.
You're a good man Schaub. I know you receive a lot of hate but please know that you have fans too.
Schaub.... dude. I’ve been a fan now a decade or so through your fighting career to your rise in comedy & the podcasts but this!!! Fuck me my man... Callen said it “If not you, who? If not now, when?... man my 🧢 off too you my guy & too the young kids & family of this Girl who lost her life.... 🙏❤️   What a fucking hero dude!! I’ll put what I can to the go.fund.me...    Thanks for being a Real One.    I’ve seen a similar visual & it took a loooong fucking time for me too process it....   I understand the feeling & shock your experiencing right now, it will take some time too get through but those kids lives you most likely saved never mind keeping them from those visuals of (mom)....   That’s what you’ve done my man & that’ll eventually be what gets you through!
De breeze everywhere. Even in windy conditions my guy Schaub got you covered. Respect.
Debreeze evrury where. Liar shutup, we know the truth now.
Respect to Brendan man holy shit
Gotta go to work in three hours I can’t sleep and now Brendan got me crying. Hell of an act man.
🙏🏻🇺🇸 great man
Brought me to tears this world is such a fucked up place sometimes, poor babies will forever have to live scarred because of there father's actions! Not only did they live through all this trauma but lost both there parents the same day! As a father of three myself I couldn't imagine doing anything to hurt my kids or wife! Even on accident Brendan will forever be a hero in these little boys life they will remember him forever you were an angel that day B! Right place at the right time and acted on it!
Prayers for the family and you Brendan 🙏
god bless brendan schaub
God bless you Schaub.
My hero
God Bless you man, your a hero
Jesus Christ Brendan god bless you
Brendan YOU da man!
You telling the story and keeping strong 🥺
Brendan trying to not cry just shows what an amazing man he is.
Good on you man.
Never talking shit about you ever again Brendan You are a fucking hero for that
Brendan always been a real one
That's horrible
But did he have to mention he’s going to pay that 30k
Okay, no making fun of Brendan today.  We all know when the shit hits the fan, he does the right thing.
This made me cry dude
Oh my god Brendan was meant to be there that day
It’s a good thing Brendan didn’t confront the father when he showed up on the scene or else he would’ve got knocked out in spectacular fashion.   Brendan that is.
Hey Brendan, you are a super hero Bubba!
Dang bro you got a Fucking big heart.
yup...i have new found respect for this teddy of a man. respect mr.shaub
Until there are men like you, there is always hope. Humanity is never truly doomed by a thousand act of hurtful genocides, but it is bless by the kindness of one. Thank you Brendan!❤️
Schuab might have his flaws we all do and people make fun of him but all the training and joe rogan lessons made him into someone that when shit hit the fan he didn’t just call 911 he got of the car and helped something most wouldn’t have done he tried to save lives knowing he might die this is very admirable, there’s a place for good souls like this.
Brendon saved that child from a lifetime of horror. No one truly forgets their own mother decimated before their eyes. Much respect ✊🏼
Brendan gets shit on so much but I see nothing but a highly motivated, successful guy who helps people in many different ways and I'm not surprised he acted so heroicly. Buzz Buzz
Hopefully all of you haters of Brendan can finally respect this man. He’s an incredible person..
Praying for the kids and their family. Brendan praying for you also, you should also find help. That's a lot to go through....
God bless you, Brendan.
his gf kinda a tool
what happened to the other black guy?
Brendan you are a hero I’m so sorry for those kids but there is a reason you were there:
Brought tears to my eyes.
Schaub is a hero❤️
My heart hurts for the kids, the family, and Brendan.. couldn't stop crying and shaking just listening to his experience...  I am so proud of him and that brave little boy. ❤❤
oh man this kicked me square in the feels my guy!!!
Apparently this entire story is BS and everything Schaub says contradicts the police reports of the incident (according to a reddit thread). Not saying that's the case but just thought it interesting.
Brendan you a real man bro!
Shaub is a no talent comic. Not a punch line in the whole monologue.
I’m not crying , you’re crying.
incredible schaub. be proud and keep talking. x
Prayers up for everyone involved. 🙏🏽
even if i dont respect his comedy or opinions....gotta respect him as a man hes a really good dude
A true fighter, in any walk of life, helps in times of necessity; when the fight or flight comes into play. You made their time of need and memory of it better because you were, truly, the fighter. God bless, to you and those kids. Good job man
Damn that made me tear up a little. Bless up man. All love
The story no one saw coming… fuccn heavy
Your an absolute super hero! Not only have you help save those kids from the accident,  but you have helped them with the rest of their lives. Bless you, it's small acts of kindness from people with the ability to reach the masses that can make the most difference. Thankyou..   I sit here crying as a mother of 3. Thankfully in an amazing relationship, but I too would stop to help. Don't forget to look after yourself and seek some counselling. You too have witnessed an extremely traumatic event. Stay safe and please look after yourself. 💛🌻
Schaub takes a lot of flak but what he did was an incredibly heroic act and he has my upmost respect for his bravery
Although Brendan is suffering from ptsd from seeing the dead mother and the traumatic experience, he should remember that he was the man that he would have hoped would have helped his own kids if they were in the same position. The kids involved could have died. Be proud Brendan, you made the best out of a bad situation.
This is fucking nuts man. I've seen the horrors..the horror in this world man
Good man Brendan
Brendan is such a good man. Legit hero. Y’all talk all that shit you want, cause you ain’t shit, will never be shit, and that’s why you talk shit. Judge yourself before you judge others. Jealous fucks. You the absolute fucking man Brendon, don’t let these cowards tell you different.
King Brendan 🙏
Stop dissing Schaub. He is like a brother to me and does good shit for people
Brendon is a damn hero. Dad strength 💪 ❤
GoFundMe is almost at 60k rn. You were their angel that day B. You're a real one
So many losers saying he's making alot of this up, this is not the way a man tells a bullshit story..
CONGRATS TO YOU Brendan , but seriously , I was shocked to hear that your wife said  to you , KEEP GOING . That's something that you did not have to tell the world , you did , and Im glad you ignored her . 100% true humanitarian.
Much respect and blessings for the big homie Brendan Schwab!
fair play brenda! you done good. respect
Good shit Schaub
people really believe this even though there is zero evidence to back it up? crazy
God reached out to Brendan at the right time!!!! Time to be grateful, and time to be graceful…  JAM UP BRENDAN!!!!
Good on ya mate!. Why did the dad think to off the whole fam. Cowardice. Selfish. Sickening.
Why does everyone have to b out of shape!? Lmaoo who cares! God bless u shaub!
Respects schaub
Bro mad respect for my dude Brendan  Not a lot of ppl would do such thing
Lol all the daily hateful commenters switched up real quick for a day. 🤣🤣losers
amazing
Not only did you do what was right.  But with good intent behind it no one can ask anymore of a person who happens apon something like that.rather we would all do that or not but to really be the person in that moment in that situation and to respond like that.. Tremendous amount of respect for that Brendan.
Rip to the mom.  Seriously mad respect for Schaub.  Fuckin legit human being
Look it don’t matter if he got A few things mixed up the fact that he help in that situation is enough for me respect b
That's fucking horrible. Good for Brendan for helping those kids
im putting all my bs hate aside for this brendan i commend you
Good for you man..... fucking terrible but those kids will always remember you.
I have never had more respect for a person in my life.
That is horrifying , glad the kids are okay , hope Brendan can also recover from this experience
Brendan’s wife told them to just ignore them and keep driving. Wow isn’t she nice lol
Very sad.
You acted like a true hero, Brendan.
I that guy pays! What a scumbag. Props to Schaub. Unbelievable
I am absolutely in love with Bryan and Brandon. Epics folks. Nothing but love for his bravery
I feel for him. I was surfing once in Ocean Beach (San Diego) and sunset cliffs. St. Patrick’s Day in 2014. I turned around to catch a wave and I saw a car fly off the cliff. It was like out of a movie. It somehow landed upright in waist high water. There were only 6 people out, I’m a combat veteran with trauma training and there was an ER surgeon as well. The guy was mangled but alive and missing limbs. We stabilized the guy while on-lookers just stood there shocked. We saved the guys life but he was paralyzed from the waist down. Later it turned out he tried to kill him self. I never bragged about it or really told anybody, I was just put in a situation where I had to act and I did. But the fact he tried to kill himself by Almost taking out a bunch of surfers in the process still leaves me angry.
Looks like the father was charged with murder as well as other serious charges
Why all the thumbs down on this, guy risks his own life to save some kids, your a good man Brendan

that story was HEAVY.  I have 4 kids 11 and under and I lost my parents young and that pain never leaves.  The sad thing is those kids probably still love their dad because a childs love is unconditional.  They will have to rely on each other for strength and for that, they must stay together.  May their mom rest in peace.
#respect
Fuck big brown your such a great person wat u did for this family is such an inspiration thing hopefully wat u did will inspire others to help out people in trouble instead of just driving by my hart goes out to the kids and family rip for the beautiful mother that lost her life big hugs and props from your brother from down under love u guys😥
Well,, it's diesel leaking from the 18 wheeler isn't as explosive,, still no joke..  Not trying to take away from the credit he deserves. I was a Firefighter for 6 years, this is a Tuesday afternoon. It you say "gas" vs fuel you get reprimanded hard. Maybe I'm just morbid now, that that is my take on that story..
Wow all the comments took a 180.  Great job Schaub u r a good guy.
check the fighterandthekid subreddit for more info
All those fuckers who always talk shit about brenden are real quite now huh? Hashtag hero shaub!
You are a good dude B.
So fucking sad. You're a hero Brendan
😓 good job Brendan that's some hero shit
God Bless you, Brendan.  You and those kids are in my prayers.
I could honestly say that if he knew how much of a Piece of shit the dad was, He would’ve probably killed him on the spot
Wow
Could you imagine being one of the sad sacks that downvoted this...
Such a tragedy. I hope those kids get the best care possible.
The definition of selflessness & bravery.
Jesus.. hopefully Brendan can manage to suppress that image of the deceased mother. What an incredibly terrible thing to have to witness. RIP
Brendan you amazing dude.
I’ve said my share about Brendan in a goofing way but his true character shined through here. I have nothing but the utmost respect for him as a man for this.
I REALLY hope that POS man who calls himself their dad NEVER tries to get those kids. Thank you for stopping...peace to you and their family.
Crazy story. I Like how they made the circus background to welcome back old wrinks
tough to listen to #respect
There was only one wright thing to do in that situation, and you did it B. Respect is the only thing that comes to mind. Hope the family gets their peace now..
Wow. Much respect to u Brendan for what u did. I think it was the right thing to do
Holy hell. This had me bawling. Good on ya, Schaub. Way to step the fuck up and do what you did. Ugh. Poor kids.
wow, that was a powerful story. so happy you were there at the time Brendan, dont usually get moved to tears by a story, but this one fucked me up. thank you for what you did, thank you for keeping those children safe and quickly thinkjng and reacting in a dangerous situation. not only do i hope the children can get the care they need, but i really hope you can get to peace with the whole event, im sure you are in a lot of emotional pain rn. thanks for sharing this story, and thank you again for all you did, are doing, and will do
Put him in the hall of fame. Idgaf how his career went. He’s now the GOAT
Brendan ik he wont read this but youre such a god damn hero. You WERE those kids captain america man.
What an incredibly gripping story. Brendan is an amazing guy.
Shaub is a legit good human being.
Wow
God damn it I used to make fun of Brendan all the time for his stupid comments and observations. Never again, the man's a hero.
Killed my vibe at work but man he’s a real one for that 💪
Omfg fucking hero
Good lord..
I watched my mom die in front me 11/10/06 the day after I turned 11 in a car accident. Was my father's fault during a drunken rage as well.. Shit is rough and has stuck with me my whole life. Thanks Brendan schaub... you fuckin did a lot for those kids man. Youre a hero of mine buddy. Love ya. Rest at night easy and calmly man, you did your absolute best that day
Clicked on this video ready to read comments going in on Schuab… then this happened. RIP to that mom.
I watched this on the full podcast and had to come here to comment as well. This is absolutely amazing. I hope he stays to what he’s always said about posting and getting out. All the things I’m seeing are effecting me just following this guy for so long. All love for you B.
Schaub what a hell of a guy
Get this man a cape! #hero
I had no idea who Brendan Schaub was before this video but I'm a huge fan now.  What a stud and a beautiful human being.
Good thing that them truck run diesel
Good job ShauB true hero
Wow Brandon,  Your a Good Ass Dude for knowing in your heart to stop and help them kids get out of danger like that,  dont beat yourself up for anything you did. you were there to keep them kids from seeing that mess.I hope you find ways to be able to clear your mind of what you saw, and will find peace to sleep again. I will pray for your peace.
Not trying to come across as a hater but I just read multiple stories about this and ALL of them say:  First responders rescued the children  The car was intact (doors were not mangled) Multiple people were at the scene not just two guys There was no oil all over the ground.  Im sure Brendan was there, im sure he got out of his car to help. He’s nearly in tears. So I believe that he was involved.  But multiple statements from the media and LAPD are completely contradicting his story.
What a selfless act you did. Your physical reaction as you speak about it shows the amount of heart and love that we all can only hope we have in a situation like that. Remember to take care of yourself, you witnessed a terrible scene and it will stay with you for awhile. We have so much respect and love for what you did and continue to do for the children. That kind of action you took is what everyone of us hopes another would do for our own family. Please follow up on this later and let us all know how you are doing and prayers will be out here for you and that family. 4 kids below the age of 8 will definitely need any and all contributions that you can get, your very name and popularity will ensure a future for them. Thank you for sharing this, I could hear how hard it was in your voice. Such a brave act.
Never rip on Shaub again. Thats that. Hopefully the worst day of their lives also turns out to be the best - or one of the best - days of their lives now that they are away from that monster and have their education paid for.
Schaub, you are a fucking hero bro the entire TFATK fan base is proud of you man!
who is cutting onions?
Schaub has always been a class act; this doesn’t surprise me. Nothing but Respect for him for this selfless act….
Good on you bro, you did exactly what so many other people should have done and stopped to help instead of just driving by and ignoring it. Sounds like you need a new old lady though, your girl should bring out the best in you not encourage you to be a part of the problem.
Was never the biggest Brendan fan but after this, this man is truly a hero god bless his soul and those children
Incredible mate
Much respect big bro. I feel for you having to see the mom in that condition, but your actions saved the kids from seeing her, and likely saved their lives. Courage doesn't mean you aren't afraid, it means you take that step forward despite the fear. You went when others wouldn't. And because of that, three children are safe. You're a real hero my guy. Never forget it.
Alot people sh*t on Brendan, but must of y'all would of never done what he did. Much respect to Brendan. And God Bless those kids. 😑💯
I will never call him Brenda ever again  Will never make fun of Brandon again....................maybe a little bit   But nah all jokes aside good for you Brandon, good representing the sport and your self
Much respect Schaub. Running into the face of danger, disregarding your own personal well being and safety, to help people, I am truly humbled and honored to hear your courage and heroism. You're a good dude and a hero. Much respect
so sad that there are people like this in the real world. bless you mr shaub, was never really a big fan of yours but i have much respect for you after this
Who are the 28 pieces of shit who would dislike this? "Boo, Brendan saved some kids and wants to help raise money for them. Boo." Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
Schaub most of the time you are a dummy but man much respect to you!!
Brendan is the man, I like to knock on him but you can tell he's got a good heart.
Brendan is a good guy. Much respect 🙏
Anyone alive would have done the same... Let's not act like this dude is a hero.
Bless u Shaub.
God Bless you Schuab
Im not gonna watch but seeing these guys w fake teary eyes for views is sick.. I hate these guys.  Brendon is the biggest tool on the internet.  He's trying to make money on people dying.  Some things are better unsaid
The dad is a piece of shit, brendan youre a hero. That dad deserves the worst.
Respect to you Man you’re a hero and I don’t care what anyone says.
The best and worse of humanity. Evil exists but good people are here to stand up to that evil.
Well Done Brendan lots of respect, RIP to the young mother thoughts and prayers are with her and the kids 🇮🇪❤☘ 🙏
Good job. It’s one of those moments where everybody says they’ll do the right thing if it happened to them, but Brandon got to prove it. Didn’t lock up, didn’t keep driving. ESPECIALLY after seeing a dude get smoked by traffic
It's mad that cops deal with horrific situations like this every day involving kids then they get called racist,just coz.
Wow
Love you Brendan your a great man fucking love you
Schaub YOU ARE THE MAN!  Forget fighting, you are a real man
Got a new fan after hearing this thanks for your gracious act!
Whatever he did or saw, I don't think he could act out the voice crack when he's talking about the mom.
God bless you, Brendan Schaub 😥
You have a good heart ❤  hope the children gonna be good 🙏
Bro mad respect for brendan, this shit is fucked
Extremely unselfish and beautiful, Brendan. Nice job!
God bless u Brendan !!
Adopt those kids that now have no mom or dad.. you are the reason they most likely felt safe in that moment. I remember this story when parents were both killed a police officer adopted the child who was an orphan.
It’s beyond comprehension how someone could be that evil ! That scumbag deserves the worst!  Thanks to Brendan Schaub and anybody else for being there for those poor kids ! They’re going to be traumatized forever 😭
You’re a Hero Brendan… ❤️
I fucking dislike schaub to the max, but nothing but respect for what he did here.
Respect to Shaub
Proud of you Brendan, I hope those kids end up okay ❤
Damn it now I'm forced to like him.
If schaub can be a hero, we all can, stay vigilent my bros!
🙏🏻
Brave man, heroic.
Have to give credit to one of the MMA News YouTube channels for mentioning this. Went out of my way to look for the story .  it hit a lot different hearing it from Brandon  himself. That's  heavy duty stuff . can't believe something like that just happened yesterday. Good man . I don't know anyone else that would have stopped .
RESPECT Schaub!
God bless your soul B 🙏
Brendan is fr a hero
when I was 8 i saw a biker get hit by a car and saw brain matter. 25 and i still remember it. that’s a scarring memory
good man
God man when he was describing the dead mom I just imagined she looked like that Porsche girl who crashed her car and her entire head basically exploded
i guarantee people will still find ways to hate on this
You are too man!!! Respect to Branden!!!
And people were shitting on him smh, not all heroes wear capes. Good job Brendan your kids will hear about this story one day. 🙏🏼💯
that bitch girlfriend wanted to leave a kid alone in an accident?, good job Schaub
100% luv and respect Brendan. You are now LEGENDRE STAT'S BRO  .
He said he told his girl .... isn’t he married ?
Your the man Schaub good job
Put the go fund me in your description box
Yall better put some respect on Brendan's name from here on out.
39 years old and im fighting back tears listening..
As a truck driver this is my worst nightmare.
The story just kept getting more and more horrific, then to see she was only 26
Wtf is wrong you people downvoting???
Hmmm.
It really puts into perspective what our first responders have to see on a daily basis. The mangled bodies, accidents etc. We need them and we need to be there for them afterwards. What a hero Big brown is. Fucking rights man
Kudos Brendan!!  Here’s the quote Bryan: “If I am not for myself, who is for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?” — Ethics 1:14
That’s a tuff story hear!  Glad you stopped to help
God bless you my boy. You’re a hero bro. 🙏🏽💔
schaub is a fucking hero, sorry the mother couldn't get the help she needed. fuck that dad
I'm kinda torn between, should that guy have died when he got hit or should he die in prison say 50+ years from now
Like this story sounds exaggerated lol
Bro after years of findng Schaub annoying now I can't help but like him. Respect man.
mma twitter better end all Shuab slander immediately
Im a funeral counselor and have to see stuff like this on a daily basis it is so hard  Good job brendan!   Its always harder when kids are involved
Notice how Schaub didn't ask for the title to be 'Brendan Schaub saves three children' for more views or attentikn, Schaub is a real hero and doesn't even want the credit. Props to him 👏
Let's just ignore the fact that everything he said in his story contradicts what has been reported.
Brendan you’re a hero.
Brendan Schaub lately has been on point with his MMA talk and I was really following him again and now hearing this is fucking heavy man. Wish you all the best man
You're a special person Brandon.
Brendan is a solid dude man, he gets too much hate for being a great person, let alone a hero
There’s a bunch of inconsistencies in the story between his version and the news. Including a 4th child actually being in the car that he never mentions and the guy never getting hit my a car going 60 mph.
EVERYONE GO DONATE AT LEAST A DOLLAR !
The Go Fund Me is now at $51k. 👌
Well done. Brendan shouldn't underestimate his personal trauma in this situation
Damn Brendan. Respect
i have a feeling Shaub is gonna have an eye on these kids forever
I met Brendan in a restaurant during a ufc event once while he was still actively competing. Me and my wife were sitting having lunch and he was at a table sitting having dinner adjacent from mine. I didn’t notice he was there but I heard a ruckus and turned around and some fan was just yelling at him and talking shit to him and the security escorted that fan out. It all happened within seconds so I was just dumbfounded. When I turned around me and Brendan locked eyes 👀 and he said “that dude was a total dick wasn’t her?” And I was like “yea dude, you must’ve ordered the last steak” he then called me my wife and my friend over and we shot the shit for a while took some pics and I remember him being one of the most chill people I ever met. It doesn’t surprise me one bit that he would be this selfless and this much of a bad ass dude. My heart goes out to those kids. I’m glad I got to meet a real Life hero like Brendan.
You're a hero dude and the title is well deserved. Awesome job!!!
Brendan, I have no clue if you’ll see this...but what you did will be remembered in that family forever.   You’re a good man.
Very noble act Brendan.
Those kids will grow old, and Shaub risked his life for them. Proper Lad !
I swear im never making fun, bantering, or ever saying a single negative thing about Shaub ever. Just a hero, one of a million, so grateful for him. Blessings to you and your family man, those kids will grow old and can thank you for that.
The father was a sick fuck and now those kids dont have parents. I am sure that scene will mess up Schaub too. Props for him helping out.
Brendan is a good man, I think everyone knows this deep down. Great job big brown, you're a real life hero
I’ve always been a fan of Schaub but he jumped up a few spaces after hearing this story. Thank you for being a good man.  Had me a little teary eyed.
watery dune hair?
Legend
How funny that you took off before any help arrived to avoid being a witness to a crash like you did in Beverly Hills a few years ago. You aren’t shit.
you can not like Brendans comedy or podcast or think he wasnt a good fighter or whatever but you cant deny that hes a good person. not every one would do what he did good on him
I feel like such a piece of shit for making so much fun of Schaub nonstop. He’s actually a good guy.
i saw the gofundme on twitter without knowing the context behind it, well now the context has me tearing the f up and praying for those kids. glad b and the internet will be able to help
Brendan, get to therapy as soon as you can dude.
Dude this was hard. especially as a dad myself.
NOT ONE DETAIL OF BRENDANS STORY MATCHES WHAT WAS ON THE NEWS- Crazy how in the pictures the back door isn’t bent, the kid isn’t fat, the guy was in a black shirt, not a wife beater, they weren’t hit by a durango going 60mph, ZERO blood or oil on your shirt for the selfie after the accident , multiple people were helping along with the rescue team, and to top it all off the go fund me was already at 30k before you said anything, don’t take credit for it going to 40k, ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU DIDNT EVEN DONATE YOURSELF. You said you saw the dad run and get hit by a car before the cops get there when the helicopter footage shows him running and behind apprehended by police. Schaub apparently witnessed all of this yet didn’t stay around to be a witness for the police.  Bloated lying loser.
Yo look at chubs on the right.     Damn dog !
God bless brendan schaub
You absolutely did the right thing by stopping. Never doubt your actions.Thank you for helping the family!  God Bless those kids and the family of that poor young woman.
Why would you leave the kids? I hope he isn't lying and is a badass.
I bet 99.9% of the people who are making fun of Brendan in the comments would not pull over & do what he did.  Brendan deserve all the respect in the world for what he did.  #respect.
God damn. Schaub, you’re a winner. Thinking about all involved
Omg this story was heart breaking. Thank god you got them out. Thank you. God bless these kids.
Dude is a hero
If schaub is lying about this its over for him. Theres already some inconsistencies with whats being reported and this video. Dicey dicey
Hero
Schaub made a sacrifice. He will be haunted by this for the rest of his life for the sake of those kids. God bless you.
Wow you really threw your wife under the bus on this one.  “Hey babe, there’s a kid that needs help”. “Fuck that kid, keep driving!”  But also, good job dude, real shit.
Wtf!!!! Brendan is a hero. Holy shit!!!
This broke my heart :(
Schaub at least got a free pass to heaven that day. What a fucking badass.
Craziest part is the fact u n your girl especially document everything yet theres not one vid of anything from you guys, juss a whole lotta bullshit
You the man buds . Always watch your shows and truly always seemed like a good dude  . Well we sure as fuck know now eh.
*Please stop at the lights and quit talkin about traffick death ... how many times do i have to warn you Brendon ... just give it a rest O.K. ... big guy !*
W for Schaub
Legit hero.
I did not expect to tear up today, damn
Needs to be more people like this instead of people taking phones out and taking video. I mean the  people at are the scene first.
Literally first time seeing this channel. Immediate sub.
Thank HIM!!??
You're an amazing man Brendan
Well done man.. Hope you're alright too. That's crazy stuff to just come upon unprepared.
Ive never cried that fast and that long in a video...it really hit me different. you're a fucking hero schaub. we all like like to make jokes about schaub, but this is some extremely honorable shit, most people wait for someone else to help.
People give Schaub a lot of shit but he’s legitimately just a good person
You’re a hero Schuab
My goodness man
There ain't nothing more rewarding than saving lifes!Huge respect to Brendan for saving these kids!🙏 💜!
👍🏾🙏🏾
Brandon you’re the man.  I once saw a man literally blow up 10 feet from me after being slammed by an 18 wheeler in the highway. A suicide. Couldn’t sleep for a few days and you don’t look at shit the same after.  God speed.
Good thing on you Brendan and Rest In Peace to the mother very sad that happened
Holy shit I'm glad this popped up good man Schaub
We clown on Schaub a lot, but he’s a good dad and a good dude. Those poor fuckin kids man
Wow. Nothing else I can say.
This is part of the reason I never understood the hate for Brendan, I don’t know it’s his ok comedy career (let’s be fair, it’s still in its infancy) or his ufc career which btw is not bad at all, he was a top 10 in the scariest division ko’s cro cop and mind you cro cop won a lot of fight after that loss so he wasn’t very washed up yet, but I digress, this is why I never hated on him cause you never know who a person really is and Brendan shown with this story how selfless he is and his warrior mentality. B is a solid dude. But I would like to also add that Brandon does Seem like the kind of guy do shut the refrigerator door with his hips
check tfatk reddit
you're the man Schaub!
You're a good man, Brendan. A good, good man.
Wont ever say anything bad about Schaub.... hats off to him... tragic story
❤️❤️🙏🏻🙏🏻
Proud of you Brendan ⚡️ legend
A very selfless and heroic act by Brendan
Jesus Christ. That's a horrible story.  Poor woman and poor fucking kids.  You did good B. I bet you you already do, but therapy is a good thing for these kinds of things.
God bless you Brendan. Praying for the kids.
Brendan I hope you can stay in those boys lives as they grow into young men. I think you have a place in those boys hearts and they have a place in yours. I think you can have a tremendous impact on them as a positive male influence and we all know how good you are with the young bucks. So much respect to you man. I thought you were the 🐐 after the Ray Borg situation but this is just wild man cannot imagine seeing something like that. You’re a good dude Brendan heart of gold
Hey guys lets try to use all our forces as the MMA community and get these kids college scholarships and as much money as we can!
God Bless
I donated $10. I literally cried when he was telling that boy he was Brave for getting on the car and waving somebody down even with just his presence. You are a brave boy and you saved your brothers. My heart cries tonight for your loss.  Thanks Brendan so much for what you did! I know you'll probably never see this but from one person who always wants to save everybody to another. You done good brother
Respect
How did the guy know where to enter the highway to hit them? Doesn’t make sense..
Sucks this shit still happens. I hope you genuinely help the fam. Train em?
Fuck man🤦‍♂️
everybody hates on Brendan, and gives him shit... but can we all agree that the guy is a legit hero for this....
Definitely sharing this story... 🙏❤️
😤Only a straight bitch would want to kill his family … RIP to the mom . God bless those kids.
Wow, what a heartbreaking story. You acted in the most stand-up way a stranger could, much respect and RIP to the mother.
Respect B.
Yo, Brendan is a fucking hero. No jokes. You did one a lot of people wouldn’t. Love you for that homie. You genuinely saved these kids. This is a tragic, and fucking horrible situation. Condolences to the children, and Shaub is legitimately the most empathetic comedian I’ve seen. R.I.P to the Mother. Donate!!!
Anybody in the comments thinking he lied or bragged about it or took a picture after the incident just so you know the pic was before the incident he didn't lie and he didn't brag he spoke about the experience he had, he wasn't bragging and also he would not be as shaken up as he is if he wasn't some way or another apart of it not to mention he helped fund money to the funeral and is working on funding money for those poor kids. The sources for his story are to credible to be called a liar and anyone saying otherwise doesnt know enough about the situation or is hands down a pile of shit human being starting conspiracy theories that Brendan is some Psychopath. Just please stop the drama there is a woman who passed a way and kids who don't have parents anymore, think of them and have some respect.
Fair play your a hero
Just horrific man. At least there was someone there to help those kids. The big fella is a damn hero.
Hero Brendan
Real hero man. holy shit.
Love you Brennan. Rip momma!
So sad
Brendan gets a lot of hate on here. This puts it all in perspective. Guy is a hero always was and always will be. RIP the Mom. 🙏
Holy shit when did Bryan come out of hiding?
Schaub deserves all the respect in the world for this. Legendary
Why is it important to say a guy is "out of shape" Fuck him.
Thank you for spreading so much love Brendan. Your a hero and a pillar in your community and so much more.
Pro tip, if you are going to kill yourself, don't kill your kids, kill this dad POS.
He is lying, LAFD saved the kids, it's in the police report
Respect man!
Fake Comedian Brandan Schaub..
For just one video can we all as a community not make fun of shaub. RIP to the mom.
Having seen a 3 yr old die from a rollover and a pedestrian get hit by a jeep doing 60, I can promise you that you'll question what would you do if something happens?  You'll never have the foresight to think about how shit like that will fuck you up.    Even movies don't do a car vs pedestrian justice, I've never seen a body twist in so many ways and I never want to again.    My man's gonna deal with this for some time.  I'd highly suggest therapy and getting something to help you sleep.  Just understand, some people are flight and some fight.  If you ever happen to be where you can render aid, it's usually required if you can safely.  Good Samaritan laws are different everywhere.  The fallout is absolutely real.
say prayers for schuab too, couldn't imagine living with that imagine in my head
I'm usually pretty quick to shit on Schaub for his internet persona, and celebrity shit, but... 1000% dropped for this one. A real situation with a real response. Threw himself on the line.
Man…. So much respect for you 🐝…. You were exposed to things most people are fortunate enough to never see. God Bless you.
I can’t lie I started tearing up watch him talk about this. Just thinking about those  kids and losing their mom that young is sad
Hero. Hope those children find a good home
The dweebs on the tfatk reddit are already trying to discredit this.
Damn I started tearing up as Brendan was speaking …you’re a hero schaub
Hug your loved ones , tomorrow ain’t promised. Say what you will , today Brendan done good
Every time i see things like this i hug my family because it can happen to anyone
As a tow truck driver you are the hero in this story there is nothing to prepare anyone em for what you did
We need more people like this
damn so his girl wanted to keep going and ignore that kid yelling for help???
What a fucking hero. YAWN!
Brendan Schaub is MY HERO!
This guy is a legend
Damn dude, initially when I heard the news I thought Brendan was making this up. Turns out it's all true.
You know what people give Brendan alot of shit. But  he's a a great person.  You are hero Brendan for stopping and helping. Those kids. I hate that the mom passed away that's so not fair.   I hope the kids get to stay together And have the best life possible.  Brendan I know your a tough guy but no one is ever prepared to see a accident like that especially a human being dead In such a horrific way  that can absolutely fuck with you, get counseling if you can't  move past this.    Those California freeway are so so scary for car accidents.   My dad lives in California and I will never forget when I was like seven a guy in like a suv was upside down  and my dad stopped told me not to move and went and broke the driver side window and had to cut the dudes seat belt and pulled him out the window. A minute later the car  was up in flames in didn't blow up. It just was on fire but it spread so fast.  Car accident are terrible.  I can't believe that guy did this on purpose
Much love Brendan, always! You don’t get enough praise on the regular, your friends and family are blessed to have you in their lives and so are we the TFATK, And Company family! S/O to you Brother. ❤️✨
Bro this shit litteraly made me cry. Its not fair how kids and women are treated .
Man that's a fucked up story! Couldn't imagine walking up and seeing that!
I’ve been saying for a long time, enough Schaub slander. He’s a solid dude. I’m here for the funny jokes in jest but he doesn’t deserve the cruel and mean spirited hate he gets online. Love you Brendan!
Good shit brendan
Brendan is a real one. Guy put himself through a lot of physical and mental stress to help those kids. Good for him and hope those kids are alright
Bbbbbbbbbbrrrrrrrrrrrroooooooooooooo
Good job brother
Ima go ahead and apologize for any snarky dumb stupid joke I’ve said about Brendan, this story shows what a great dude a beast of a man and a damn hero he is
Brendan you are a hero. Sending love.
“debris, iowa”
Brendan, take care of yourself. This is legit hero shit, but you need to talk to a professional and make sure that you're okay. Reach out to your cop/vet friends, they usually have good resources for traumatic incidents.
Seeing a dead body like that will change you forever. ☹️
Lyin Brendan made the story up
G shit man
Dana white needs to get involved the whole ufc needs to
I had a very similar thing happen to me a few years back in AZ. Car cut off a semi and the semi went straight into a wall at 70 right next to me. I won’t go into details but i was the first guy up to what was left of the truck and helped remove the driver. It was a life changing experience. I totally sympathize with Brendan on the sleepless nights and the trauma he is gonna have to deal with from just doing the right thing.  Brendan has all of my respect, and the victims family have all of my sympathy.
This is the problem I have with Brendan, I'm pretty sure he's a great and cool guy, but he's just constantly has to be the biggest and loudest person in the room, but hearing this story, made me have massive respect for him. Most of us would not have stopped and helped
Brian gets so awkward when it’s real talk. Lmao
great job, Brendan. Truly. Wow, prayers for those kids and victims. :(
Please go to therapy man even if it’s only a few sessions, this situation will stay with you for the rest of your life no doubt, but it will be about how u handle it.  God bless b what u did was nothing short of amazing.
Much love Schaub, you are a Hero now ❤️
Brendan is a fucking hero
Usually i like to clown big brown because its fun, but he really is a good dude. Always looking for the positives in someone, always helping out, just a really good dude. God bless you and your family Brendan
I'm a truck driver, this is my biggest fear on the road. This fear keeps me alert at all times. Prayers to the family 🙏🤲
There are very few times in life where things happen and you can be the person that makes a difference. Just is what it is. Those kids will have this to watch in their healing process.
It took me years to be able to watch the 9/11 attacks. It’s normal not to know how to feel.
3:35 heard it in your voice
God damn.. rip to the mother. Shaub is captain america in my eyes for this man all respect to the man
Respect schaub!
God bless Brendan
✊🏼
Much respect to Brendan.
The only good thing that happened to those kids that day was meeting you man. Not all heroes wear capes. Some wear Cleveland Indians hats.

Schaub - straight up, try to get some professional help to deal with this trauma... It's heavy and something you don't want to carry by yourself. Much respect for doing the right thing and saving those kids... You are a good man

Honestly who's giving the clip thumbs down... It really goes to show the world has pieces of trash, that will dislike a guy saving kids from a car crash....
Brendan's a hero
Damn Brendan is a fucking good man.  Teared up watching this.
What a guy mate one of a kind you lad 👊🏼not many people would stop and do what you’d do lad
Schaub you are amazing man I really mean it. Hero
Say what you want about the show, the pettiness of Dana towards Schaub, or any other keyboard warrior vapidness.  Brendan is a man!
You’re a good man, Brendan. Hell of a lot of strength, bravery and courage to do what you did. The world is better for it.
Credit to Big Brendan Schaub.
I think the aunt was of the mom who died.  So that would be the kids great aunt.  Wonder if the kids grandmother is still alive?  Very sad story.  Heart goes out to the family and thank God Schaub was there to help, any type of spark and they would have burned alive.
God damn it now I'm a true fucking fan of Brendan... where do I buy a thiccc boy sweater
Real hero bro! Respect!
Brendan is a fucking hero respect , warms my heart
I already loved these guys and God bless the family and tfatk
Respect to Shaub
moratorium on schaub slander for at least 72hrs.
one crazy story. Gotta give Schaub credit where credit is due. That was brave
Made respect man. Stop all your shit talk now and help donate
My heart stopped when I heard this. My prayers go out to those poor children and their mother. May she be seated at the right hand of our Father 🙏✝️🕊️🙌 You did an amazing job Brendan 🙏
Put some respek on Brendans name for once. God bless him and all those affected by this tragedy
I'm absolutely heartbroken to hear this story. God bless you Brendan for helping at the time of the accident. Also helping the family in their time of need.
Bren man... I been watching you for years.  This is something that speaks to the type of man you are.  Bro you did such a noble thing.  I know you know how it all went down.  You were though one of God's angels bro.  God bless and may those kids be able to find their peace
I know that Jesus protected those kids and used brenden to save them
It took Brendan saving kids to get y’all to like him 😂😂
Massive respect big brown ❤
I used to make fun of Schaub. Never again. Donated.
Pathological liar
Chills. Stand up guy.
much respect for Brendan.
Brendan is a real dude
i saw the accident and it was dead stop traffic for hours for only a few miles
Good Job Schaub
schaub is the man
Your a great person bro...thanks for sharing
You are a real life hero brendan 🙌  I’m so proud of you man
It would of been great if his wife wouldnt of went on social media gloating about his good deed! Good people dont have to tell other people about their good deeds
❤️❤️❤️
this is fucking crazy. Schuab, I’ll never fucking disrespect you man. too real
Respect.
Respect man rip
🥺
Good man Brendan 🙌🙌
Parents get term life insurance TODAY bc you never know and your kids depend on your support.
I just gained a whole lot of respect for Schaub for this one, way too many others would have and DID drive on by, he did a good thing here for sure! ❤️🙏
How tragic. God please hear our prayers for this land. Take care of these children 🙏
everyone say a prayer for this family
❤️❤️
God Bless you Brendan
Well done Brendan
Lol at all the gullible people here believing this story. He drove by with his Porsche.
You’re a hero
I had a similar awful story when I was in junior high.  My parents and I were the first or 2nd on the scene of a horrible interstate car accident.  We were helping a young woman calm down and see the extent of her injuries as she had blood all over her.  Even though it was nearly 30 years ago, I remember vividly her crying in our car asking how her fiance was doing knowing full well that he died in the accident.  Truely heartbreaking and I pray she was able to find inner peace and happiness since.  Same for these poor children in this story.
I like Brendan a lot more after this story.
I know we all make fun of Schaub, but I have new found level of respect for him. You can see how impacted he is, and just the fact he stopped... man. Good job, Schaub.
And people who 1 don't fight and put their image/health on line and 2 would never even fathom helping others in a situation like this,still have the gall to make fun to f Brendan for losing fights and being a meathead. MMA fans are the worst fanbase of any sport.
Respect.
Domestic violence is not something to f**k around with. This is tragic, and so many women end up dead at the hands of their significant other. Thank you Brendan for helping the kids. I can't imagine what this family is going through. AND F**K THAT GUY. I hope he never sees the light of day ever again.
Great job Brendan.
Schaub did what 99.9% of people would not do, including me. Big heart ❤️ he's a real life hero
This is truly amazing and you are a hero. You saved them and helped ensure they didn't see more of their mom like that. You are truly a great man. Let's help those kids and keep them ok
Cue the “I don’t like Schaub but…” comments
Respect
schaub is a fucking hero!
this is funnier then schaub's comedy routine
I talk a lot of shit about Brendan but he is a badass for doing this
I grew a lot of respect for schaub after this
Props Schaub. Forget the jokes, I’m proud of ya bubba. Praying for all those involved in this insane situation to have the strength to carry on.
Kids basically lost both parents in n instant. Prayers for sure!
Brendan you’re so full of shit. You didn’t say or do half of this.  Quit lying bro u just called 911 and kept driving
I hope there is a hell for that pos father...why someone thinks anyone else's life is there's to decide for is beyond me.
Brendon you already helped those kids out
Damn. Wish  Brendan was the  one who got hit instead
B, you won my respect back, you dumb but you got a pure heart
Holyshit…🥺🥺
Real men deal with real problems . Well done 👍
This is why ppl need to chill when they take there shots at the guy when he's being slightly shitty..cuz at the end of the day he is a father a son and a good person
Am not crying you are. Rip to that poor women and I send all my love to her poor children. You did amazing brendan my man
Jesus... Rip🙏 to the mom 💔 ... stay up schaub u did your best💯🙏
I shit on Schaub like a lot of others but truly a selfless act by him. Those kids are so fortunate you stopped. Hero shit.
To reiterate what Brendan said... "Look at al these pussies, driving by, doing nothing."  💯
Definitely a MOVING episode wow. BRENDAN🙏
Man, alot of the people that talk all that shit, sure are singing a different tune now, huh? All joking aside, you're a hero to those kids, sir... Respect.
Not even a Schaub fan but soooo much respect for him.
Made me tear up a little. Thanks for being a good man.
❤️
This is one of the most selfless acts I’ve ever heard of, this is so inspiring thank you for being a hero B

You have redeemed yourself in my eyes Brendan, respect 🤜
We will be Praying for those kids tonight. Good work B you’re a helluva a guy to do that act of kindness. You should be proud of yourself today.
Brendan, You are a real one with a real heart. Thank you for what you did for those kids man. They needed you more than ever and you risked your life for them.
Good job B👍🏼
i'll never hate on B again.  its ok if i got to hell... but not for that.
Jesus Christ. This was chilling. RIP to the mom
wow his girl said "just keep going" what a useless piece of trash
Crazy as it seems, I actually have a new appreciation/respect for mr Schaub
Damn all Schaub jokes aside he's a damn real one for this, legitimate hero.
Such a beast that kid thank god
Sorry you had to see that B. No one should ever have to experience that.
Those poor babies . At least now they have someone who’s gonna make sure their lives are somewhat better going forward so they have a brighter future.
Thats fucked up. I witnessed a crash about 10 years ago. Young lad had his head caved in man I still see him now. Worse thing I've ever seen
Damn man. Legitimate heroic behavior. Good fucking stuff Brendan.
Fuck man... 😔
If this story is half way real, Brendan is the Shit! all catzs cheeto fingers needs to STOP. I'm the first to rag on Brendan for his  idiocy. Dude if this a correct recollection of what happened then this podcast should rocket up to 10mil. All love to you Brendan and what you did. Xxxxxxxx
Good lord. B please get some therapy man. Please! Love ya man
Fuckin hell. That's so heavy man. Good on you for keeping a level head and actually helping instead of just fuckin rubbernecking.
