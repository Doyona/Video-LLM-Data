The fact that a wealthy adult can be that stupid is quite concerning. Theo’s vote counts the same as everyone else’s btw
ive never been truly baffled by stupidity untill i heard randall speak....
SOS originally didn’t mean anything and was just easily distinguishable via Morse code.
BAKEEERRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Theo managed to miss 17 50-50s in a row...
I'm done watching anything with Theo in it. He's an egotistical poor sport.
Racist Road is a real place
23:21 Kon humping😂
I love how Randy is just doing this 😊 for 38 minutes.
The fact that theo is confused about fighting on foot when we still fight on foot is quite amazing lmao also they had cars and trucks in ww1 they just didnt have canons attached to tractors with 20 tons of armor plating that England pretended were water storage tanks aka “Tanks”😂😂😂
Kon is such a good person bro he’s a goat
Harrys done an alabama hotpocket😮
Is Australia in the Pacific Ocean  Randy:no
just pointing this out con got the russia question wrong in this video and the latest one lmao
Randy and Kon wow👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 the weight loss this year
cus theres 3 in the Kardashian group they can be nicknamed the KKK
Hahahaha Richard Dick is in politics over here in Australia 🇦🇺 hahahah
Where’s Harry’s hoodie from ?
This video makes Kon's glow up even more insane 🤯
What dick short for Richard? Cos he wasn’t blessed
.
Love to Theo but he’s so wrong about everything bless him 😂
Harry’s general knowledge is mental
L KON FOR THAT LOL
Man, you are in the presence of a master. Kon you are a unit indeed!
They all set theo up with that chocolate sunrise explanation 😂😂
24:29 saad maan exists, he is an iraqi military officer
0:35 KFC would of been an elite name
26:16 WTF harry that’s disgusting 🤢
Harry and Randy straight up confident that Australia isn't in the pacific
I love these gameshows
26:12 WHAT
saad maan is a real politician in iraq
"so Germany invade France.............................. by feet?" fucking jokes lmao
Theo mannn plzz stop Youtube and go back to school mate. you so dum 🤣🤣
Bog answered 14 questions correctly btw
We need a Pt. 2 FRFR
29:16 WAHGHAHH
9:40 BY FEET?????
Harry came clutch at the end. Heck yeah lol
Oh god. Thought the alabama hot picket was what Harry calls his sister
People who played impossible quiz know about bitchfield
Poor Kon, Harry stole his Dick Swett joke right in front of him 😂😂
Theo is well funny 😊😂👍😋
Where did the term SOS come from? The expression “Save Our Ship” was probably coined by sailors to signal for help from a vessel in distress.
35:39 that’s why he is the goat
32:10 that picture of harry is foul😂
Tiverton is in Devon, not Dorset.
Cold Lunch  Harry: that’s foul  Also Harry: I am a victim of a Alabama hot pocket
30:41 Ahhh so that's how JJ got that scraggly looking beard
Maybe I'm just american but why tf did Randolph sound so weird saying Lebron at 3:00
I've literally only just realised I walk under Tickle Cock Bridge every week to go to my local rugby club, Castleford Tigers🤣🤣🤣
Best part is that Russia is in Asia not Europe...
The tank question killed me on the inside, the UK literately named the thing a tank so people would think it was a water tank on tracks.
Harry straight-faced through all the questions and answered all of them correctly. He is way more than "drugs"
A tank is called a "tank" due to them wanting to be secretive and the original rhombus design resembling a water tank.    The name stuck ever since
Theo Baker!!!😂😂😂😂
Harry's trivia run was insane
Theo is such a manchild, Or he is too curious about everything xD
Bro this video had me dead the whole time 💀💀💀
Saad Maan is a real person
We need more of Harry answering quiz questions this is elite
can we please get this game show back!!!!?????
37:53 Baker -2022 charity match
Harry was incredible in that last round
9:33 "why not tell them to fuck off?" bruh harry's too much 🤣🤣
How are you guys mentioning anything BUT Cal not knowing what months the semesters are in..
need this series back ASAP
How is no one talking about the sec position Harry said he was in 😃
bro harrys quick fire knowledge is wildddddd
Mate Harry is actually so smart
Calling someone a moron than being completely wrong 33:58
That last line by Theo aged well lol
9:03 theo said good knowledge, germany invaded belgium and then the UK got involved, France wasn't affected at all
I lost all of my remaining brain cells listening to Theo talk about ww2
:)
Harry! My guy!
For the videos after those on different channels they were saying "OMG theo so good at golf" But Harry really popped of and it was over shadowed by theos tantrum Then again nom of this matter especially in Sept 2022
Are we just not gonna talk about harry and the Alabama hot pocket thing
My name is saad lol😂
I’m kind of sad they didn’t add Harry Baals to the politician list
Wilma Dickfitt is a great drag name
Why has Harry fell victim of an alabama hot pocket? Many times!
Harry’s general knowledge is elite
Harry’s general knowledge is elite
“ so Germany invaded France… by *feet* “
Britain invented the tank !
He put in 5 balls in that’s 10 and the had 15 + 10 is 25 so ended in 26 and 25
👎
Bro how do u not know the 3 months of winter?
this really teared me up, nice video!!!
“Where was captain James cooks ship” Every Australian: PACIFIC GOD DAMNIT
21:54
Theo makes these videos so funny! On all of the game show games he makes everyone laugh so effortlessly. Big up Theo!
saad maan is a real person btw
saad maan is a real person
feltch ln does exist tho
Saad maan is actually an actual iraqi military officer. Not quite fake.
I done a cold lunch to a girl once in a nightclub....not on purpose mind u. By the time I'd finished vomiting shed gone which saved the embarrassment lol
23:12
9:42
When you see that the kamasutra positions was the most replayed 😳
Theo loves to act smart lol
17:20 "Shitterton is next to Tiverton, in Dorset"  As someone from the Westcountry, no it's not. Tiverton is in Devon
theo once again proving why he should shut up and just kick balls about. Compensation for lack of hair tbh.
As soon as I saw the guessing the road and fanny hands lane come up I knew it was real because my brother has a photo with the sign 😂
Do another one wit same people Simon you nerd
The fact there's names for the sex acts, shows a lot of people do them, I am scared.
Big up impossible quiz for Bitchfield
fun fact: Australia borders 3 oceans, pacific, indian and great southern
Richard  Rick Dick that’s the connection
I think Theo has his world wars mixed up
Damn Harry smashed that
THEO carried
26:14 was jokes🤣🤣🤣
harry GOAT
harry..............alabama hot pocket🤮🤮
Theo is jokes 😂😂😂
theo is the biggest waffler of all time
They need to make this with filly😂 would be mind blowing
29:55 the scoreboard made a dick on the sex position
23:20. "Barrbara😂😂😂
Cals face @29:18 is killing me
"Envision them dating..... - nice..."
30:32 wtf why
Kirsty must be a really lucky woman in bed with Kon
The James Cook question lol he came to Australia you guys should know that
23:18 man i feel sorry for theo lmao
Is Theo the one in the zebra stripes? He went all David Brent after the putting.
23:58
There's always that one person who is in the toilet doing drugs and then is late to everything 🙄
Fun fact: a lot of those instagram siblings or datings will purposefully grab sibling photos and just label them as dating anyways
Yeah the albino guy should have just left
Get him to 10 m
It’s because it rhymes or sounds similar . Dick Rick Richard. Jim jam James. Tim Tom thomas
Theo is so annoying… and dumb…
All I got from this is don't listen to Theo
Theo is actually so… i wont say dum, but he is…
theo is the british jake paul with his dumb.
This vid was alright until Chris turned up
Baker was livid at the end 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Test
Harry was un real! I’m this.
Yeah no Theo is annoying in this one
Harry should play beat the champions because he knew so many questions immidiately
Harry is such a catch, brains and beauty 😭 more people needs to realise this
March is still winter until the 20th. Every season is within 4 months but only two full months. December isn't winter until the 21st.  But Freezy was way off and that's just unforgivable. Into the snake pit!  Not really, that's terrible.
Some of the wrong ones could be names of someone, just not politicians in the US or UK.
They're coming for you, Barbara!
Great video, props to Harry man what a guy
This is the only way Harry will colab with Simon
Theo is definitely a confirmed virgin now (no hate only jokes)
Stop crying Theo
I've watched 8 out of 10 cats does countdown and I remember where they played something similar. So I knew Lady Garden, Dick Sweet, and Butch Otter were real people. lol
5 seconds in and still got the title wrong
Australia is in the pacific hahahahahaha
no one talking about how harry shat in a woman’s hole (alabama hot pocket)
23:13 He got shOt dOwn 😂🤣
Did Randolph call propaganda, Perineum?XD
O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.   (1 Corinthians 15:55-57)
Harry's General Knowledge>>>>>>>>
i thought sos was system of safety ;-;
Theo's face when Simon explained Harry's experience 🤣🤣🤣
Chris MD😍
"I think they had really good boats cause that's how they did it they didn't have cars so they had to have boats right" lol
bra russia isn’t a country💀
Randolph didn't do anything in this vid ahahah
Harry was on smoke in the last round
russia is part of europe?
shout out my guy mike hawk
Theo getting mad at the end is hilarious, he was talking the entire time Chris was putting lmfao
Wow Harry really impressed me
You're a wizard Harry
Enjoyed this video a lot!
Harry's knowledge is surprisingly good
how many drugs does callux take daily
29:18 Cals in a different world
WE'RE NOT SAYING WILMA DICKFITT
“So it’s not siblings or dating it’s just dating killed me off”
Zawful
NO ONE CALL HARRY DUMB FROM NOW ON
I don't think Theo realizes an A in GCSE maths is not much to write home about lol
Theo is actually so boring and cringe
This is A GREAT LOT you know. The perfect assortment of personalities for a video. Good one lads 🙌
Pog
Harry was on fire in the last round🔥
Theo is so stupid
This is a Sidemen Sunday quality video, well done big Si!
"auzy isnt in the pacific" wtf yall are dumb
when you get Ernest shackleton confused with James Cook lol
qer32reewmreqkfkewokppljojj2h3eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
This theo guy is pretty annoying you shouldn’t have him in vids
Theo was so salty at the end I love it
This was the next best thing to Sidemen Sunday😂
Harry 💯🤴
This should be on trending
Not long to go now. Been here since his Your ultimate team series and I will be happy for Simon when he reaches 10 million subscribers. A very good YouTuber who puts an insane amount of hours on a number of platforms and uploads on avg 8/10 content. Anyway this was a really funny video, thanks.
Actually as fun to watch as a sidemen video
Harry on fire fam
How is Theo so confident in the answers he gets wrong but doubts himself when he's right. he honestly makes this video so much more entertaining
9:42 I think Germany could maybe also use vehicles that arent tanks, no? just maybe
Simon got me jumping with the f1 question 😂
Harry actually smart as paint. (Treasure island reference)
Not to take anything away from Harry....but everyone saying he's got immense knowledge or whatever....they were fairly easy questions.
300k more sub
We want more
I live next to ticklecock bridge lol 😂
i dont think i've seen anyone mug themselves off as much as theo lmao some of his answers are so stupid its jokes
Brilliant video
theres a cockfield near me 😂

Not a fan of Theo here
I may not have gotten every question but these lot are dimmer than Viks basement full of children. I cannot continue
😍
HARRYYYYY ON THE LAST ROUND
“She has no top lip” - Randolph 2022        😂
Germany invaded France...... by feet. What a line 😂😂
I've been to Wetwang
This is better than most sidemen sunday vidoes
ChrisMD? oh I didn't know it was Chris's Missing Day
Do a one word interview with filly or chunkz
The trick with Siblings or Dating is if they look the same they’re dating lmao
Would you rather Theo’s ball knowledge or general knowledge ? 😂😂
i should not have looked up alabama hot pocket
I couldn’t tell if Chris was ever gonna show lol
see randolf, click off.
The reason dick is short for Richard is due to rhyming  so with rick being the real one they rhymed it with dick lol
Getting closer to that 10 million mark keep grinding and you’ll get there.
Shouldn't have googled the Alabama hotpocket
Theo IRL i bet is a right dickhead, he's actually really annoying to watch.
They thought it was a WWII question.
Best gameshow on Youtube!!!
Elite
28:21 Chris what the fuck
Randolph was really helpful at the end
Racist road 😂😂😂
That 8 right, 8 wrong rounds were HILARIOUS!
Kon’s insistence with Wilma Dickfitt KILLED ME!
BIG BRAINS HARRY
Bro, hated the reacting to JJ, or others moves.... but love this! keep it up ;)
I saw Willy Wells on the board and was impressed they found that since it’s a small rest area in Arizona near me. Then they said it wasn’t a real place 😂😅
Wilma dickfit : every indian ever
I knew of bitchfieldcoz I've been there a lot
Hey guys I’ve got some really great news to share with you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died and resurrected on the third day so you may all have eternal life. If you repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Thx for reading.
Cal's face at 25:57 has me cracking up
Pacific ocean isnt australia  Me 🤦🏻‍♂️
Simon Shirt ID ???
Randy has clearly lost some weight, good on you bro!
2 mins 10 seconds before i stopped watching ......
bro wtf harry pulling some vik smarts
harry general knowledge is mental
30:15 how does he manages to get everything wrong. The for that is so low probability and he still manages it.
Theo fuckin cracks me up lmaoo, cunts hilarious
Theo is quite the intellectual
Harry smashed it
"are you actual morons? It was 1912!" (when World War TWO ended LMAO)
Bruuhhhh harry is soo smart wtf
The shot was a bit over the time so Team Helmet really won
Proud to say I have been to Tickle Cock Bridge
Lol I’m American and Young Boozer was the only name I recognized
It’s Actually So Mad I Genuinely Didn’t Know Harry Had That Much Brains 🤣🤣
Theo low key saves videos
love how they completely ignored racist road until the last part🤣🤣🤣🤣
even tho we get a vid every 6 months, this channel still bangs
SOS doesn’t actually stand for anything it’s only those letters because it’s easy to remember that string of dots and dashes
Harry actually smart lol
Right, very random question but do you think if the sidemen and beta squad combined eould it be good?
Theo is bare annoying
Theo is low-key a karen
Theo was thinking of ww2 not ww1
Fucking hate Teo the mug
is it just me or is the letters moving in a slight wave  @19:18
This is the Sidemen in a alternate reality
Harry went at it in that final round. Exceptional general knowledge
Theo talks way too much
32:09 wyd harry
Harry is an animal!!
Randy's no hesitation when he states what SOS stands for 😂😂
simon, the three months of winter are november december and january, not feb
SOS stands for save our ship
Harry does most of sidemen reacts videos it seams 😂
10mil is so close,  proud of you Simon
24:30 simultaneous head movement from cal kon and small man
Quality, Harry’s GK on point
Theo made this hard to watch, doesn't add anything just really annoying
Harry is the ultimate goat
minter is really good at hosting sheeesh big up
Best one yet.
Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.   (Ecclesiastes 12:13) - It's a short-lived journey through life. Believe in Jesus, repent and be saved.
Bring back Harry's Fun Facts
Russia is not part of Europe
Fun fact for Richard and James nickname were because dick rhymed with Rick and Jim was better way of shortening the name instead of let’s say  jam when it came to James
Why didn’t they tell them to fuck off 😂😂
i agree harry is knoweledgable.. but can we talk about the sex position bit alabama hot pocket and he said hed been a victim of it 🤣
Theo’s actually stupid bro. Lmfao he got every question wrong
Why did Theo get so rattled at the end💀💀💀
Theo is lost😂
really enjoyed this I hope this gets decent views and he does it again
Kon is definitely an absolute unit in the bedroom
Simon saying the country with the biggest population in Europe is Russia, made me question whether the answers of these gameshows are correct.
Great jersey Theo
harry 'is Australia in the pacific' theo/randy 'no no nooo'  err
😂😂😂
the editing quality for the main channel is insane
Butch Otter representing Idaho strong!
Harrys done alabama hot pocket?🤮🤮🤮
HARRY IS ACC SO SMART OMG
Nobody talking about how Harry’s done the Alabama Hot Pocket multiple times…
Russia isn't part of Europe G
Hey Draco. Tiverton is in Devon! Not Dorset  🙄🙄
Simon: largest population in Europe Con: Germany? Simon: Russia 🇷🇺  Russia = Europe
Im 99.9% sure Theo is a virgin 🤣🤣🤣 his sex positions answers were mad.
Hi mate you remember that time you uploaded several racist videos and did blackface?
Mad how Simon has borderline SDMN level content on his main channel
Theo was chatting to chris when he was playing golf. What was he on about lmao
This is hilarious there was some proper “compilation” worthy moments 😂😂
Simon: Which luxury car has a prancing horse as its logo? Randy: jAgUaR  Love Randy 🤣💀
25:20 Theo was gagging for it, followed by Wilma Dickfitt
Minimums
34:04
country with the biggest population in Europe... Russia?! Europe... 😅
Anyone know what Chris said at 14:09 😂😂😂 I can’t decipher it
Whats the guys name that was doing golf? Hes such an annoying person
There is a place called the gloryhole near me in Lincoln it’s legit a ally way 😂😭
harry oh my god
The title is click bait 😂

So Germany invaded France... by feet? 9:42
Theo is so cringe

Theo carried this video, got me crying
Harry is so knowledgeable 🐐 🤩
i swear saad maan is a politician
I’m gonna be honest Theo is so annoying
Ayo Kon.....that was some serious practical knowledge there.
In the next sidemen tinder I think we all want to see the beta squad. That would be so funny 😂
Theo is fkn funny 😂
you are really trying so ill sub
the real or fake place game had me DYING
10M is pending…🙌🏼💪🏽
I never thought Harry was the dumbest. I never thought he was the smartest either. But he does know some stuff
What a sore winner. Ungreatfull punk just wow.
This video had me dying laughing great video!!
anyone else questioning team kardashians about how they were talking about events that happened in world war II, when the question was about world war I
"We'll go with Baker..."  "You should stop!"   Hahahaha, poor Theo isn't coming on a quiz game show again 😂😂
lit ep.
Randolph sounded sooooo certain that Australia isn't in the pacific ocean. 😅 Poor Harry.
Wilma Dickfitt

the editing is cold on this
Theo makes my head hurt
We love randy and this show absolute unit
29:15 funniest thing
Fuckin harry lol “it’s just one point if he’s tricked us fair enough”  🤣🤣
This was a really good video
Saad Maan is real btw. He was Director of Media relations for Iraq from 20011-2018
That would be world war 2 theo
40.16089° N, 90.76611° W coordinates to feltch lane so it is a real place Simon minter
Theo is the best, very entertaining
Tiverton isn't in Dorset theo🤣 it's in devon, close tho.
you should get chunkz filly and hp
Isn't Russia in Asia. How is it the largest populated European Country?
i was convinced chris wasn’t there when he actually was i thought he was still edited in
Hello good evening thanks good bless you Hola feliz tarde Dios les guarde siempre gracias
Harry actually smashed the questions at the end 👏🏻👏🏻 well done w2s
Great game show!
Theo is a class A victim. What a lad
this could easily be a sidemen video, unreal Simon
>>> sidemen Sunday
i think its obvious its not fine with theo if they want to "cheat"
38:14 Did you  notice that Kon just stole the airpods by putting them under his hoody
This is such a quality video, Sidemen level stuff, big ups to Simon and the production team as well as the competitors for coming out and entertaining (Except Chris, he didn't do much).
Harry is so smart but also VERY dumb dunno how
15:10
Russia is not in europe wtf?
lovely vid simon
Lol, we don't make a big deal about much freezy. Have you been to Can🇨🇦ada 😆 🤣
Harry knows stuff
Nearly at 10 mil🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Haarrrrryyyyy! Brother. Gheeeez. Where did that knowledge come from 💪
Helmet Brothers but no Helmet boy. HELMET BOY ORIGINS
Theo is ……… errrrr
The ww1 question made me mad
Bring back the football videos!!
I swear Theo is confusing ww1 with ww2.
bless you guys this was so funny deserves 10 million + views 🤣🤣
well would you look at that🤣🤣
I regularly visit buffets in different cities around the states. Before I go to a buffet, I will place 6 corndogs in my jacket pockets. After entering the buffet, I sneak the corndogs into some of the fried food section trays. It is such a joy for me to see other customers of the buffet eat my corndogs thinking they were part of the buffet.
i love how at 30:21 the right answers make a peculiar shape in correspondence to the questions LMAO
I'm 100% sure there is a middle eastern politician called saad maan
Harry is smart wtf
Theo is honestly a child
that retention/participation though 0.o always happy 4 ya m8; but bro if someone is going to spoil the prize pool thats a red flag or in the very least edit it out?
theo so racist these guys enterain it
these teams are elite
When you choose to give vent to uncontrolled energies, to the mouthings of the evil spirits who pronounce their cursings with every other breath - mind you, the breath of the holy spirit - you are choosing the way of bondage. And if you choose that way, a muddied path in the swamplands of life, one day you will look up and see the pilgrims spiraling up the mountain on the path of freedom and you will wish that you, too, had taken that journey in the sunlight.
Anyone else see the letters in "Boobly Dingle" moving at 20:05 ? Hahaha
Russia isnt a part of Europe so it cant have the biggest population in Europe!!! Absolute robbery of a point
Minter gameshow
that guy doesnt have enough knowledge to know he is bald
'What's he on about?' 'his big cock'   🤣🤣
Theo seemed just slightly a bit too bothered at the end there and even went on his phone, real rage?
There’s a place named mount little dick where I’m from
Theo's existence is just pure waffle
"Team....Helmet....Brothers" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I bout choked
Buster cherry 🤣🤣😭😭🤣🤣🤣
harry carried in the end tho
we need behzinga harry and Theo on a team next time you do this
The lack of basic knowledge hurts.
prompts to the editor , i love the content no matter what but editing makes it so you want more
7:52 "im in the room" lmaoo
Love when they confidently explain their reasons for a wrong answer haha
"SOS" dosent actually stand for anything it's just the easiest do say I Morse code
Harry is actually very clever🤯
Harry’s fun facts paid him off well
Id say this is better than a league of their own
Russia isnt a country its a terrorist land
😭😭
Plzz
Theo is full of nonsense!
Absolute morons dont know James cook cames to New Zealand 🤣 my country OMFG boys
Wait so harry has been victim to the alabama hot pocket mutiple times?!?!?!
Funniest game show??? At least the participants are amused.
this video lowkey funnier than the last sidemen vids
Harry was a beast on that last round my word. I'm sure Vik was caught shaking 😂😂😂😂
Romans 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
Harry Fun Fact: SOS doesn't actually stand for anything, they just chose those letters because they are easiest to do in Morse Code.
Please do more of this
Theo was legitimately wrong about everything lmao.
Kon tries to hard to be funny
THEO LYING THE WHOLE TIME HAD ME IN PIECES LMAO
Get this man to 10 million please he will buy me an iphone 13 inshallah
Really thought Theo would've matured out of being a tryhard LOL
Harry Fun Fact: SOS doesn't actually stand for anything, they just chose those letters because they are easiest to do in Morse Code.
Mad how Harry just flexed the brains and they didn’t bat an eye lol big ups the mega mind that is harry  982 2
this was better than the last sidemen sunday
Theo's knowledge of history sucks but I appreciate the follow and will always have your back.  Your history still sucks lol
Harry- 'is pacific where Australia is?'... all collectively say no... *facepalm*
SUB TO MINIMINTER CUS WE NEARLY AT 10MILL - SUI
Russia isn't European its Asian! At least 75% of it is.
HARRY A WHOLE GOD
Ephesians 5:16 NIV  making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.
Theo made this a great video instead of it being a good video🙌🏻👏🏻
Harry’s quick trivia ability is mad wow, that was impressive
What a squad <3
Why is Theo wrong about everything😭5:49
29:57 really that shape of green boxes in that category🤣🤣😂
theo is the loss-condition
Tommy beat you to 10 million
SAAD MAAN Wtf😂😂😂
27:07 Chris describing Kon's classic overcompensation went unnoticed 😂😂
theo is so funny in these lmao
harry: its not even a funny knock name. lol
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT HARRY AND THE ALABAMA HOTPOCKET
Randy is amazing, crying with laughter.
Keep on going simon 🔥🔥🔥
Tbf about Theo and James Cook, he did explore the arctic, but that was a different time
love it simon more of this n bring back rap or crap pleaseee
WE GOT #1 TRENDING!
harry killed it!!!
Big up Theo
Oyi do your research saad maan is a solider
I recommend not going the racist road 😌 19:42
Bring back Harry for another one of these! What a legend!!!!!
What are the months Winter?
7:43 Fastest comeback ever
Theo Baker, go cry on your mum's shoulder!
2 minutes into the video and Theo has already flexed his A in GCSE math, must be a record
77% of russia is in Asia while the Eastern 23% of it is in europe...so i think the last quickfire question for team helmet brothers was answered wrong by simon 🤣🤣🤣
Those weird names on the places, you know they are going there in the future
I remember bitchfield from the impossible game
Amanda D.P throat
Let's all appreciate the amount of effort this man puts in his videos, amazing. Keep grinding bro, I love the videos
Harry is a beast I am so happy
This video is 🔥🔥 best I’ve seen in while from a non group channel
great content simon!! loved the vid!
south africa from theo is so poor 😭
I love how during the tank question they was talking bout ww2 and the question was about ww1
So close to 10 mill
Oi …. Harry toggled at the end
@miniminter The camera should not be positioned in front of the players' table. In my opinion, it should be further away from you so that it catches them more from a certain angle. The other team should be at the same angle, but from the other side. This way it is easier to imagine the studio and the camera jumps are not so drastic (and there are quite a few of them and they are disorienting)
Finally no more of boring ass tobi
Damn Harry really popping out those quickfire questions XD go on lad.
Freezy had a good night before this video 😂😂
Theo was on about the endurance and Shackleton on that question lol
Harry was the definition of clutch in the last round. His deep knowledge of fun fact was finally helpful
am i tripping balls or is the text moving at 19:42
'Wilma Dickfitt' had me dead all day lmao. XD
Great game show Simon! Loved watching it
Humanity is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty.
Theo is so white he is probably developing cancer from the studio lighting
Team Kardashians FTW!
get simon 10 mil ❤️
I’m fucking eating then the sex position quiz comes and now I don’t want to eat anymore
Cool
This channel's turn into a joke, simon another stinker 💀💀
Russia spans over 2 continents . . .  it's pretty big
monthly game shows would be the one,
Has anyone clocked on calling Randy "Randad" yet?
This game show is goated
🔥🔥
yo
1. Theo is such an underrated YouTuber. Funny as hell. 2. Harry genuinely is so smart.
POV: Your name is Richard
🐐
The editing on this was insane

SOS, does not stand for anything. It is a distress signal in Morse code, 3 dots (S) 3 dashes (O) 3 dots (S) the abbreviations are just backronyms

Harry: "IT SPAN IT SPAN" Also Harry: "im quite knowledgeable"
The amount of brain cells I just lost watching this video 😫. It hurts!
This Theo guy is super smooth brain, good lord, its embarrassing that out of all of them he's the one to take it so seriously that he got lowkey flustered at the end.

Thought vik was the big brain of the sidemen, turns out harry has a bigger 🧠
bruh
1 on trending
This vid will prob take you to 10 mill so congrats in advance
Low-key Harry’s smart as fuck
That's bad form Chris.1 being late, a good man is never late. 2 bad sportsmanship, distracting and cheating. Theo was right to have a go at Chris.
'is australia in the pacific? no..."australia is fake confirmed.

How does Freezy and Kon not know the 3 months of winter😂
since when did Germany invade France before the UK got involved, Germany invaded Poland before the UK got involved. Theo clearly didn’t take history in school
Saad Maan is an actual politician though
Harry just flexing on em on that quick fire round.
23:23 SAAD MAAN    S   D M   N
Get this man to 10mil
The Slippery Simon is definitely covering yourself in oil then shouting “time to smash it”
Brave from Theo piping up about Cal not knowing a history question
Love game show videos sm This was fun to watch. Cheers Simon
GOATED VID
It span…It span😃
Road to 10mil :D
This vid is a banger
wetwang has been in a sidemen geoguesser i think
Theo not mentioning Wafflin was slyly heartbreaking
Theo is so horrendous it's painful lol
Simon lad these are funny as fcuk laa keep it up !! Wallahi
Germany invaded France during WW2. They weren't able to invade them back in WW1.
They shoulda put AMR's Mike Crack on the names round 😂
Theo the artic ship they just found was caption James Scott not James coook
33:34 ....cal does not look impressed by winter being in dec jan and feb 😂🤣😂
I swear i don't always see his notifs even if its on
Simon could make this a big series or maybe even a TV ceries
I'm sorry but 14:40, there's no way in the world that they aren't siblings
“Is Australia in the pacific?” “No” “No”  🤦‍♀️
wetwang is east yorkshire ahaha not far from me
Harry is just OP
The fact that Simon was petty enough to put Chris last in his links just cause he was late
Shitterton is next to tiverton in dorset 🤣 Pretty sure they're in somerset
I’ve watched this twice 😂
Harry really said Australia isn’t in the Pacific
question about ww1 meanwhile theo describing ww2
Bring back rap or crap
How thick is Theo by the way
anyone know where to find Simons shirt?
How did he not include the town of fucking
10m soon cmon bud
Harry went genius mode at the end 😂
Cmon guys just subscrib to this poor guy he has been tryin to hit 10 mil for a long time .its kinda sad
As a lincoln yellowbelly the tank question just hurt so much because my home town was the birthplace of the tank
theo just waffling is so funny 💀🤣
Harry pulled out the Autism card on that last round. Quick fire knowledge champion
Theo’s logic is mad fucking donkey
simon is so close to 10 million!!!!!
Harry got fed up with theo lol
*Your consistency and quality of content never disappoints !* ❣👍👍👍👍👍
This was my favorite gaming video lmfao. I rate the production on this minter never misses.
Theo is psycho
Simon is struggling getting to 10 mil lol
hi
Could we appreciate the Editor!
russia is in Asia what the actual fuck
why does harry act dumb. he smart as hell.
This video is so good.

Theo’s team completely abused him in this 😂
Kon and Cal should’ve named themselves the McCanns
Nah this video has me crying I can't lie 😂
nice knowledge...
harry is smartttttt bro wtf
40k away from 10 mil
Bro number 1 trending on gaming!
harry is on every channel but his own
theo gave ksi his salt
Harry CARRIED the Kardashians
Nobody deserves to hit 10k followers more than Simon
Segment on the real/fake was hilarious
I see Harry so I watch
Baker's ball knowledge is horrendous
The fact that he put two unskipable ads
This is the best gameshow on YouTube
This video was a banger!!!!!! Loved it
Theo said globes are false and Randy said is Russia a country or a Federation funniest thing ever
Harry really surprise me with his knowledge on the final putting round! Congrats you silly buffoon
Theo would make a great MP Chats pure bollocks anyway  lol
You should have a fan on each side aswell. May give some knew flavour to it
Is the blonde balding guy acting or is he actually that daft?
its scary how Simon's production quality is reaching the level of Sidemen's.
simon with facial hair is just a nonce.
Great video 😂
i absolutely rate the challenges in this gameshow hahahaha so good!!!!
This is a whole ass sidemen Sunday😂😂
harry in the quick fire questions omg
man harry is fokin genius
17:34 i dont want to be named Argyle if im just gonna be known as “The Bastard.”😔
40 minutes well spent
Yo Kon, that was mad. "Helmet brother #3, should be coming soon *smirk*"
As a Canadian I feel attacked by Cals comment about our country size
I love how Freezy tries to explain the peepshow. It’s creative for sure, someone just needs to tell him that what he described is actually called the Abraham Lincoln. Used to be my favorite but I may have been swayed to the Alabama Hot Pocket 😂
Theo carried at the end. The guy is so much jokes whenever he features on anyone's channel
Theo baker is the dumbest person to seem smart ever
Theo’s general knowledge is actually terrible
38 minutes of Theo's own brain gaslighting himself
SO CLOSE TO 10 MIL
when will this guy ever get 10 MILLION !!!
ticklecock bridge is right next to my house lol
Get this man 10mil
"Who's the King of Pop" "Michael Jackson"  Theo: "Of course you know that you nonces"💀💀

Theo is a bonafide superstar
Let’s just get this man to 10 mil he deserves it
9:03 THEO!!!!!

Harry was the GOAT in the last round. Apart from the Prime Minister one and the FA Cup one he was rapid.
I swear Russia’s a continent not a country?
Harry is a fucking beast at that last round, Jesus Christ
40k away from 10 mil
How the FUCK did Harry get all those quick fire questions
34:05

368057th
Kon's missus is a lucky women. Mans knows his stuff. Guys experienced
When randy spoke about SOS being related to ships; the nautical term for lives lost at sea are 'souls'. So he is right to an extent.

W2S loves a hit of the Alabama Hot Pocket
Harry is mad trivia-smart
Chip would be great in this game shows
It was all going so well until the World War II question…. Embarrassing. I rate Freezy, but that’s horrendous. 😬
Theo crying at the end😅
Did Randy really say Australia isn't in the Pacific Ocean 😂😂😂 Stick to being funny bro.
10 MILLION MINTER SOON
Siblings or daiting going mainstream!
harry’s a genius

Harry knows so much bruh
Istg the lack of knowledge on the question about tanks in WWI was so hard to watch
*#1 ON TRENDING ON GAMING* let's go boys
Still amazed he hasnt got  to 10 mil!
Theo should stick to physical sports instead of mental sports 🤣 Mbagge was fire 🔥🔥
clearly freezy doesn't know canadians
Theo was so fuckin dim in this. The lightbulb is screwed off
harry actually crushed that quick fire round
My goodness Theo should’ve listened to Harry more 😆 Makes for a good laugh though 😂
every Australian is fumung right now when Theo got arctic ocean
Finished on 32 points
Get harry on a question of sport asap
freezy looks 10/10 in this
I actually live near fanny hands lane!
Theo is just pathetic
Bring in actual prizes for the winning team. But if an incentive would be fun
The Boa "Kon" strictor
wait so harry has done the alabama hot pocked
What a video line it
Harry got knowlege from all the fun facts lmao good job!
You are a goat miniminter

Calfreezy and Theo are butters
My autistic tendencies came out at this  3:44 ESPECIALLY WHEN I LIVE IN AUSTRALIA.

1:42   3:51      6:58.   9:30   21:35     28:50        34:05
Someone get this man to 10 mil
28:09 Kon is funny af
Are we gonna ignore the fact that Harry was made to do Alabam hot pocket multiple times? 😂
Great video btw
Why doesn't miniminter do his skits anymore
before 9:56 this tank question pissed me off lol
26:16 I just got my food and decided to watch this video while eating AND NOW IVE LOST MY APPETITE🤮🤮🤮
get this man to 10mil already
Saad Maan is actually a real name, he is the spokesperson of the Iraqi Ministry of Internal Affairs. So u kinda got that one wrong.
They need to do a podcast crossover ep and call it “what’s good fellas”
Alabama hot pocket!!! Really harry 😂🤢
K2S in form here
Tiverton is in Devon
They didn’t know Britain invented the tank? Fuming
I’m just annoyed the human centipede wasn’t one of the sex position options
25:56 Calfreez.exe has stopped responding
I knew that Bitchfield is real because of the impossible quiz- its in the road sign question-
James Cook discovered Australia which is near the Pacific Ocean
16:00
I feel sorry for Harry being a victim of the Alabama hot pocket not only once but multiple times
this video is goated! more these people please!
I'm incredibly curious on wanting to know why on earth Harry was doing Alabama hot pockets
That podcast question where theo said what about pitch side what about wafflin theo 😂😂😂😂
How’s this man not on 10m yet the content he gives us 🔥
Harry *plays mediocre or bad the whole game*  *does good on the last round*   The Fans: Ayyyy! Harry is mad smart you know, really showed off his knowledge.  ☠️
24:30 Saad Maan actually is real lol
9:50 wait till they find out about cars lol
“I love when Theo does this cuz he’s always wrong” 😂😂
Wot
Tiverton is in devon
I remember the teacher telling me about shitterton and we also made jokes about the place.
Someone get Theo a stylist
Kon is proud of being russian in the current times, aight then mad
Theo Baker is just cracking me up
No mirrors in Theo’s house then🫣
This video was a banger awesome 👌❤
Harry deserves to go on a proper game show wow 😂
nice
Holy, Randy's bunny cheeks are shiny today.
These gameshow videos are goated
Harry was quick with the answers in that final round.
30:10 Every Harry Maguire peformance then being picked for the starting line up
Saad Maan is actually the name of the director of department of media in Iraq
U so close to 10 mil
Harry is insane
randy talking about the 1700's " I reckon they did have good boats, because that's how they did it! they didn't have no cars then so they had to have boats right?" cars, planes. they're same thing really....
Randolph the GOAT
IS IT JUST ME OR DOES CHRIS LOOK EDITTED IN?
Russia is in Asia
How do you not know the winter months? 🤨
Harry in the last round was brilliant 🔥🔥
Theo’s attitude stinks. He has no banter, thinks he knows everything, and is arrogant. Harry and Randy were great together, the other team worked well too. Shame, I used to think Theo was ok.
Applauding russia… slava ukraina
Harry is actually smart as fuck
Why didn’t you show the whole round for some?
wetwang
Still going, team cats
Is australia in the Pacific? No🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is good enjoy Simon’s video

Harry Big Brain🙌
Fun fact: Butch Otter has appeared in a previous sidemen video similarly as another “which name is real/fake” question. Why do I know this? Because I live in Idaho,USA and he was our Governor.

Richard - Rich - Rick - Dick
I seen the names of places that could be real and it reminded me of a town about 2 hours away from me….it’s called Dildo in Newfoundland. Jimmy Fallon is the Mayor actually🤣
This was so fun
Something is up with theos brain
Theo had me in bits on the tank question
Simon this shirt is heatttttt 🔥🔥🔥

Harry is absolutely brilliant 🙌🏾🙌🏾
They should include Theo in the next sidemen mini golf, he’s too good and jokes.
I almost cried in the politicians names
Too funny 😂
This should be a long series. Awesome vid.
Harry and his fun facts are GOATED as vikkstar says! My man was getting right almost every question during mini golf.
Can we get this man to 10m please 😭

Why did Chris still looked green screened in after he arrived! Or am I buggin 😂👏🏻
Harry killed it!! dang impressive
Theo said it with so much confidence but he’s so wrong, Shitterton is in Dorset, but Tiverton is in Devon, 70 odd miles away 😂
This video will get Simon to 10mil subscribers, mark my words (currently on 9.96 mil Subscribers)
Theo is a numpty

Minter’s gotta involve alcohol in these games , they are so fun!

Why Theo talking about World War II when the question was about World War I😂😂
