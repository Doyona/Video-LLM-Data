5:24 the foot thing would only happen on Nickelodeon
I watched it when I was 6 and couldn't get enough of it lmao My favourite episode was the cheese and jerky song.
0:31 Did Bro just invent 67
Dude, you’re the most hilarious dude in the whole planet
If it was a Nickelodeon show the feet thing might have happened
NOOO DYLAN IS ONLY 20!!!
"Ya I heard she was kind of a bully" was diabolical 😂
i love coming back to rewatch this. i really want him to watch the movie though
I applaud the boldness to tell a Scarface joke that references the plot of the movie you for sure only half paid attention to like 8 years ago. The commitment is what we come for Dylan
Lmao the first and the last . I was obsessed with this show as a kid and watch all the seasons. The last episode is very different because she’s 17 and turn 18 after the last episode was filmed
Dylan flames the same kinda jokes that he keeps on making like i am damn sure that he were to watch his own content not knowing that it was his, then he would be flaming it as well, so basically that makes his audience(us) just kids
I hope you’re aware now that Honey is a scam 😂
the fun Dylan would have had when she drops the secret and gets cancelled for literally killing Hannah
The honey add DOES NOT age well
I hate clickbait there is no way this is a 30 year old
I want a tall glass of English breakfast tea.
You should do a first and last for Brooklyn 99
LMAO I SKIBIDIED THE PART AT 18:00 were the card busted in her hand!!!!!!! 😁😁🤣🤣❤❤😂😂🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂👍👍😁😁👍👍👍👍
I watched this show when it first premiered, and the only joke I really remember is the in fact, the ketchup one.
Ok so I just had your YouTube recommended to me and I am loving it but tell me why I believed you were 20 lol so just so you know, you do look like you’re in your 20s if you’re not!
Thank you for posting this Dylan, watching you react has been such a healing pastime 💕💫🥰🤟
9:32 How is that unintentional😒That’s one of the most obvious jokes in the episode
Child makers 😂
Please please watch the movieeee
Dylan is the only guy that doesn't promote stuff having a big makeover or unneeded dresses. Thank you, Dylan!
This is why we all rewatch reactions or old shows...i never knew Lilly had such cool punk jeans🎉
Naughty Dylan having a Honey sponsor !  ;)
girl its an all expenses paid trip to paris go to college next year
I'll never forget running up to  my room after school waiting for the show to start. I was literally me and my beat up hannah montana wig jumping in the bed and signing the intro. Times were good back then.
do sex and the city
4:47 fun fact for those who dont know. He plays the main character in monster house. I love that movie
When I watched this, I knew the sets were fake but I suspended my belief so hard, I believed they were where they were
The title of this video is misleading, you're clearly 20
PLS PLS PLS DO AUSTIN AND ALLY I SWEAR ITS SO GOOD...🙏
You should watch the Hannah Montana movie
4:45 that would 100% be the plot line if Dan Schneider was in charge of this show though 🥲
Daily Reminder: JESUS LOVES YALL ❤️ 💝💗💕💛💝💖💚💓💕❤💌💛💖💝💙💌💓💖💝💗💘
Jackson went on to own his own karate dojo
It only works if you watch it as a kid with no possibility of rewatching it or watch it in one go. There was something magical about running back home from school just to be able to catch new episode. That's why I am afraid to rewatch it as an adult, don't want to ruin that nostalgic feeling when thinking about HM. Also the jokes were landing just fine while watching it as a kid, the transition from one scene to another was smooth, now its's kind of...
Hannah Montana was one of my favorite shows when I was growing up but it really fell off as the characters got older. That’s how I personally feel anyways.
It was good at the time lol. I got teary eyed at the end all over again…then annoyed when I thought of her love triangle lol
Corbin Green got me I was dead on the floor😂
The sponsored bit didn't age well
For the feet thing, I’d recommend a Dan Schneider show. 🤪
I wanna know what Dylan thought the punchline to the Jackson has no skills joke at 23:29
Dylan forgetting and then remembering this is a kids shows is so funny to me😂😂😂
I understand Miley. Because it's the best of both worlds being famous and also living a normal life.
Ur reactions are so good “😮”
I wish Dylan did more shows like this it's a little more light hearted
DYLAN IT WAS IN THE FREAKIN SONG THAT YOU THOUGHT WAS SO CATCHY LOL 😂 she wants the best of both worlds
I desperately need you to watch Henry Danger
This ad read didn’t age well 😅😂
omg lily is actually so annoying
Hannah Montana is suuuuper cheesy, but it is a lot of fun. These admittedly...are not the best episodes. You did not really get the Hannah Montana experience with just these episodes.  The earliest episodes had like NO budget to work with, and they were all so young and...not good at acting whatsoever (although that kind of has its own charm and entertainment factor). It takes a handful of episodes before it really finds itself. The middle gets a lot better...seasons 2 and 3 are the best. Season 4 kinda switches it up...they changed sets, changed the name to "Hannah Montana Forever" and while it had some good stuff, it lost a little bit of the charm and heart that gave it its appeal. Season 4's biggest redeeming factor is the climax of the show when Hannah finally reveals to the world that she's Miley, and the few episodes afterwards where she deals with the repercussions. I have to say I ABSOLUTELY LOVE that they didn't do it in the last episode because the episodes following are some of the best. It really shows WHY she didn't want all the fame and attention and the benefits she got from her normal, incognito life. It shows how it even affects her friends and family. She can't even go have lunch with her grandma without being swarmed.  I know this video is 2 years old, but...just know that these episodes were NOT the most representative of the series as a whole aside from giving you the general premise. You kinda get a feel for the characters' personalities, but even then...eh. On the off chance you ever decide to give it another chance, some of my favorite episodes are: I Am Hannah Hear Me Croak, Song Sung Bad, Ready Set Don't Drive, Don't Stop Til You Get The Phone, and Knock Knock Knockin' On Jackson's Head.  The guy who played Jackson may have been older than his character, but he's honestly the funniest character on the show and definitely underrated. He plays the part SO WELL and he doesn't come across as being much older. I don't love all his plotlines, but his sibling-chemistry with Miley is UNRIVALED. They squabble and rip on each other and get on each other's nerves in only the way siblings can, but also defend each other and clearly appreciate and love each other. Best relationship on the show by far.  But I really can't stress enough that this show's quality is kind of a bell curve. The budget kept increasing and for a while that meant the quality rose with it, but after a while it kinda started losing what made it so good, and it was clear Miley didn't want to be doing it anymore, and even though the production was better, the quality dipped back down again. (Although it was always Disney-level quality. The acting/tone/production in the movie is much better and less Disney Channel Cheese, but the vibe isn't quite the same.)
The sad fact that Dylan will never know about Roxy the incredible body guard 😂
Jackson was my favorite character. I also didn’t realize he was in his 30s until much later
for me the movie is the real ending honestly
Have you already seen the movie? Because THAT is a masterpiece for me
Aw geez, anyone watching this in the future don’t download honey
Lol watching this after the great honey scandal XD
You dont need it to be super complex to make it for adults. We adults also watch simple stuff
You dont want fun, you want crime tragedy happen, psycho
I ❤ that you did this. HM was one or my FAVE shows & it ended up being less cringy than i thought it would be 100 years later. Im shocked that it was only 4 seasons. A fun show all around!
You're hilarious!
does dylan have a patreon?
dylan: the emotional scenes are hitting  *me watching this episode for the 100th time and still sobbing just the same as i did when i was 9*
Giiiirl honey being the sponsor of this video aged baaad
Dylan: “The show sucked so hard” Also Dylan: skips the meat and potatoes and all the good parts of the show. Hahaha 😂
Honey is a scam. For anybody who doesn’t know by now. It doesn’t search for the best discount. It gives you their discount which is usually way worse that any one you would find by just looking for one yourself. They also scammed the people they sponsor too, I don’t remember how though.
You should watch het movie
Contrary to their show counterparts, BTS Miley and Lily did not get on at all
dyland once again got scamed
Honey is actually a huge scam. Please look it up real quick, because honey is actually taking YOUR money, too. Love your videos!
rewatching this hits different after the honey scam haha
I genuinely thought he was joking for a second when the honey sponsorship on account of recent events but this video is two years old lol
I was really bummed when I recently tried to watch Hannah Montana again, because I loved it as a teen. But man oh man, is it terrible... at least the first episode was. It does seem like things improved, as far as the quality of acting and Lily not screaming all of her lines. But that first episode was soooo hard to watch. I couldn't get to episode 2.
This is when Dylan vs Disney space bar war started
I didn’t remember the last episodes being so bad 😭
"this was not a far leap. i took one step and then i was here" 😭😭😭🤣
"Get a different set" .... it IS a different set lmao they moved like a season before the show ended I think, or at the very start of the last season. Totally different beach/waterfront and totally different house!!
bro watched 2 episodes and is complaining about how he isn’t connecting with the characters? like duh
The start of the show is bad because they're too young and the acting is bad. The end of the show is bad because the people who grew up with the show are too old for it and the youngens are too young to know all of the lore.
I don’t like hearing you say my name or nickname, too weird man
Having watched this as an actual small child, HOLY SHIT Miley was young, in my memory she's like,  almost an adult (which she was in the final season I guess) but she's like, also an actual small child in the first episode.
I actually thought he is 20/21 cause in so many videos he said it and i always thought he looks way older not 20 but here it says 30... is he lying ?
Why does Dylan keep saying college is a scam? Is there a story about it?
I just found these videos today. Second one and I am very entertained 😂  I loved Gossip Girl and Hannah Montana and love you hilarious commentary 🤣
I wish that's what Hannah Montana was about lol
What if you did a first and last of sweet life on deck?
We need Wizards of Waverly Place
U r being cringe right now copying the character
I definitely agree that Jackson was the best character on the show 😊😂
Amber and ashley are al lot in HM but U watch only the first two and the two last episodes so how do u wanna know it?
Can't believe he won't see the episode with Larry David
i have such a big crush on Dylan
Seaview Middle School.. no way!! That’s the name of my school I went to. Way before this. That was wild seeing that just now
Please do a review of the entire show 😂
If you want that successful payoff literally the same plot is used for the ending of Alexa and Katie where they have to choose and it works out so well where we see them go off to their different colleges and come back for holidays and be happy. I like that ending as sad as it can be.
Was that Mandy from young Sheldon?!?!???!!!!!!!😱😱😱
4:50 It's horrible to say but if Hanna Montana was a Nickelodeon series... That's what would have happened 💀
does anyone else rewatching it now notice how mean miley is to lily all the time?
i love it only bc of nostalgic reasons like it came out when i was 6 and i instantly loved it & love to sing so she was like my first idol in a way lol but i would prob not like it either if i didn't watch it back then. i think the earlier seasons are better tbh
“I’m not connecting with this” sir you are a 30 year old man
I know I’m late to this video but I just realized I never finished Hannah Montana as a series even though I was obsessed with it when it first came out but aged out like 2 years in 😂😂
You should react to weird and ridiculous commercials
also watch gilmore girls next please
this is just one of those nostalgic shows that are fever dream adjacent w a full prefrontal cortex
i need u to do wizards of waverly place
i hate the last season I've only tried to watch it but its so cringy but the first 2 seasons were actually so fun
First and last steven universe?
To be fair the last season and probably half of the season before that i stopped watching. I became very busy and didn’t have time for my childhood favs but i remember my friends talking about it and i thought maybe I’ll finish it but i just found it hard to finish. Ofc it’s a kids show and cringey but earlier seasons were more fun. Like the long fast talking bit Miley does was not originally that long and so it was a lot funnier
27:30 “I wanted to be a part of it” WATCH ITTTT ALLLLL
Watch the movie now!
10:50 I think what she did is genius. She IS famous AND has privacy and freedom to retain her childhood. That’s genius.
This makes me wanna rewatch the series 😭😭
Lily was really funny and it was thanks to Emily Osment, she did great.
A kid becomes famous will be a big thing because that kid may can not have a normal life like other kid
6:43 WHAT??
I love hannah montana ! the ending made me bawl !
I know I'm 3 years late to the Pretty Little Liars episode and 1 from this one, BUT, I can't believe no one called out that the girl who played Jackson's girlfriend was the blind girl from episode 1 of Pretty Little Liars!
Hey everyone Jesus loves you and you are not alone
Him not being the “say what” joke killed me😭
I love the "Firsts and Lasts" videos but it's also so frustrating because Dylan only gets to see the Phases in which noone had any clue yet on what they were doing and those when they were all doing such a bad job that the show had to be cancelled. The best part is just missing
awweeee, baby Mileeyy <3
Dylan's laugh is so infectious <3
Fun Fact: Hannah Montana & HSM premiered on the same day
Y’all know Disney wont let them cut the belt buckling 😂
The foot pic rant was hilariously weird
You should react to the most popular episodes & the movie! These episodes did not do the show justice
you should watch lab rats its my fav child hood show LOL
Modern family next please.
i’m surprised he never commented on the fact that oliver and lily were together
You must be a Gemini. To describe and critique the acting, cinematography and have a great eye for detail orientation screams Gemini to me. New subscriber here!! Found you with your Saltburn reaction and “Friends” review 😌
Wait... does Dylan not find out that Miley revealed her identity as Hannah to the world???
I remember watching the first couple episodes and then it was taken off whatever channel we had and I never saw it again. And I'm totally fine with that bc even the conflict of the first eps was so unnecessary to me as a child I didn't even care for it. 😂
do wizards of waverly place
Please please please do LOST or BEEF or DEATH NOTE.  hi from berlin
This is so random but I heard about the Disney kisses. They’re only only allowed one per season so I guess they were saving it for Hannah.
um no, you haven't watched the whole thing. you watched a couple episodes of some of it. I loved hannah montana it was definitely my childhood. and i've re watched it about 4 times now. and watching you watch it, actually makes me want to watch it again for the fifth time now. also i'm watching dog with a blog, suite life of zach and cody and just finished wizards of waverly place and K.C. undercover. also finished Austin and Ally. and i'm starting to watch good luck charlie.
its a new house. yes
Hannah Montana was a big part of my childhood but like it can stay there (although some of the music slaps)
The thing with kids shows is that they are made for children. Well my momma did like “Hannah Montana”, because it had Billy Rae Cyrus and she thought it was funny. I’m 21 and it’s still one of my favorite shows, because I loved it growing up. I still rewatch it every now and then. I’ve tried to watch kid shows that just came out with my cousins and I hate them. I hate them, because I didn’t grow up with them.  Also I’m surprised Dylan didn’t comment on the fact that Oliver and Lily got together.
I hope in the future Dylan does a movie commentary for Hannah Montana: the Movie 😂
the ads part are smoothly done.
i hate the main plot of the last two episodes like why tf would lilly be so selfish? she gets pissed that miley won’t turn down probably the biggest career opportunity of her life (so far) to go to college with her when she could just take a gap year and go the next year if she wants but either way if she doesn’t actually wanna go to college for herself then she shouldn’t go just bc her best friend wants her to ? when you’re in college you can still hang out with friends outside of college ? and then when she invites her to paris she acts all excited just to end up not going 🙄 like if she was a good best friend she would be excited for her best friend getting a huge career opportunity not get mad that she won’t go to a college with her that she doesn’t even want to go to i hate that miley ended up dropping the movie and going too bc like dylan said it showed they can live independent lives and have different dreams and still be best friends instead of being codependent and forcing one of them to give up on their dream so they can live out the other persons dream
I enjoyed the show when it was on. I was surprised when I found out Miley and Emily didn’t get along in real life.
Hannah Montana is one of the only shows that still completely crack me up
It’s not possible to love a show by only watching 4 episodes. That’s just my opinion. 27:26
It that theplace where lucifer jumped of the ledge with Charlotte
There are definitely better episodes than the first and last ngl, it would be great if we could reccomend some for you to watch 😂 THOUGH WHEN I WAS WATCHING THE LAST EPISODE, I WAS FRICKING BALLING MY EYES OUT AT THAT SONG
I can understand why Miley wanted to keep her secret from her close friends. She wanted to have normal relationships that didn't have the risk of being about fame and money. But after Lily finds out, I no longer see the point in the secret.
i rewatched the show after a while and i realized the same three conflicts happen EVERY single episode, rendering for the show to be hella repetitive
His just laughing at everything lol 😂
Dylan notices that guy laughing hysterically who he says is in the back row, because that was him, sitting in the studio audience.  I've watched plenty of Dylan, so I can see the differences between his on camera identity, and Dylan in public.  That's right Dylan, I know about the wigs.  I also know about your fake mustache, and I know we both remember the sideburns.
Dylan is so fun
I’M SO GLAD SOMEONE AGREES THAT CORBIN BLUE IN ANYTHING BUT HSM MAKES HIM CORBIN GREEN
4:50 if it was nickelodeon I bet thats how they would  have done it 😭
Lola luftnagle
he needs to watch the movie aswell.
You should do alexa and katie
You expect so much from Disney kids shows😂😂😂 they don’t care if it looks like shit because kids won’t notice
It’s the way you call yourself a narcissist, that proves to me you are not a narcissist 😂😂😂
I think you’re right that college is overrated but I also think it’s realistic that girls would rather go to college with their best friend than do a movie
1:27 nose ring 10:37 honey
Can you do first and last of One Tree Hill sometime? 😂
You should do Wizards of Waverly Place
No no no no you fucked up, season 4 is the worst, I never watch it. Season 2 is where it’s at, it holds all the good jokes and ya missed the whole thing 😂
Dylan’s feet plot for finding out Miley is Hannah Montana would definitely happen if it was made by Dan Schneider and on nickolodeon
"Kids are enjoying this" Yes, i did. I was obsessed as a kid😂🥰
Jason Earles is clearly the best part of this show, just judging on these episodes. But maybe that’s because I know and love him as Rudy from Kickin It
Sooo wizards of waverly place next??
The earlier seasons were funnier in my opinion and I'm 24yrs old
4:50 If Hannah Montana were on Nickelodeon 💀
I never realised how much worse the newer hannah Montana was...I think I stopped watching after the third season...which was a good choice.
Top 10 Hannah Montana songs of all time:    #10 Need A Little Love  #9 Barefoot Cinderella  #8 Don’t Want To Be Torn  #7 Love That Lets Go  #6 Butterfly Fly Away  #5 If We Were A Movie  #4 See You Again  #3 Ordinary Girl  #2 Just Like You  #1 One In A Million
My partner is a video game tester. He's one of the best and YET still gets paid fucking peanut's compared to all of his colleague's. Thank you for even noticing the plight of game testers. They're very necessary and yet are seen as some kind of extra that isn't needed.
Honestly the last episode wasn't that good as the first one and rest
28:06 O my God she was just struggling with thoughts. She didn't feel like she should be in Paris
26:33 Doesn't feel impactful. You have to watch the whole show to feel the emotion
14:28 I thought you watch first and last
10:57 I get it. She would not have any privacy at school
Jackson is the funniest character from all
9:40🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:30 I just laughed immediately after hearing Jackson
0:24 what are you talking about?
16:46 that face 💀 when Dylan becomes dead inside
Next the wizards of waverly place
WAIT YOU'RE 30???
Been bingeing his videos for days get out was great….we continue
After bingeing your videos, I finally feel like you're a familiar friend. I've learned so much about films but also about you - like how you appreciate cinematography. And feet. You appreciate the intricacies of sound design, constraints of film budgets, the number of toes on a foot. It's really nice to get to know you, even if it's parasocial. Also, I really love that one joke you did. It was great.
Ahh the iconic closet as a kid it was all i ever wanted 😍
the point is she gets to keep the best of both worlds duhhh
Thanks Dylan, hilarious 🤣 also I got the honey app 👍
I did a rewatch of some Disney shows - and the only shows I could rewatch as an adult and still find entertainment in was Good Luck Charlie and Hannah Montana. I tried watching Suite Life, which was my favorite show as a kid, but those jokes did not hit and I got bored (although Brenda Song was so underrated, same with Mr. Mosby).  The fourth season of Hannah Montana is definitely the worst - the crew thought they were ending on the Hannah Montana movie, but was renewed for the fourth season (hence the new location and why Oliver wasn't there - he was filming a new show). It's good for closure, but besides that, Seasons 1-3 remain iconic and good and the 4th season is meh (although, I'm glad they rectified the Jesse situation).
I love you 😂😂😂
I Love this Man 😭😭
respect to Dylan for dying but still managing to choke out a "that's what she said" joke
he needs to do this with riverdale
The only way to stop bullies is with more bullying.  😂😂 no lol also the hey bitches im hanna Montana 😂😂😂. The excitement about the dead mom lol 😂
They look way older in the last season
You cant love hannah montana if you didnt actually watch hannah montana 😂 you missed the best parts
Honestly more a fan of the movie than the entire show
There’s a reason the emotional parts between Lilly and Miley don’t feel impactful. From what I understand, the two hated one another outside of the show
I grow up watching this show have a blanket and pillowcase also had a poster
Wavery place please
You should do this with Austin & Ally
GOOD JOKE CORBIN!
Hi Dylan I love your videos 😍 I am ismahane from Algeria ❤ you're amazing keep going
28 years old is young age,this is not old AT ALL.
U and MID remind me a lot of each other
as someone who did video game testing for like 2 yrs it pays great. they try to low ball you but dont accept those i took the ones who paid 200+ for a few hrs or 1500 for 6 days 8 hrs
its not charizard its JURSURD LMAOOOOO
Plz do la casa de papel
Dylan you are goddamn cute ❤️🥰
Rico and Jackson were hella more entertaining than the main characters
I didnt have Disney Channel growing up, but a little while back my younger sister wanted to watch it with me on Disney+, and all i ever did was cringe at it and make fun XD I didn’t even watch the last season lol
watch twin peaks
This is exactly the kind of show that starts slow and gets better, it was neither good in the start nor in the end. All of the series good hold was somewhere in between ig more of in season 2 and 3. Season 1 was bad there was no plot and actors were rlly kids. But then in 2 and 3 was dramatic there were more plots and story lines, the jokes were good my jackson and rico moments are hilarious. And I remember how stressful I was over miley choosing the right guy lol. Season 4 was just bad, non fuuny and miley seems very uninterested in it as she did not wanted to return to the role.
I loved Hannah Montana as a kid but I did not watch the last season it was a bad spin off thing they tried
Dude that intro song really brought back some memories haha. Hannah Montana used to be my bread and butter when I was a kid
A separate murder mystery show for adults to watch where they investigate the deaths of all of the dead mothers of Disney kids is genuinely genius
haha i was ready to laugh and cringe at watching hannah montana again but the second the music started i got soo excited and i am not embarrassed! this was THE SHOW and I'm not Sorry!
I stared watching Hannah Montana on Disney channel so the first episode I watched was somewhere in the second season which that and season 3 were the best of all
The brother looked old as hell, wow. What a dumb show, lol
I watched Hannah Montana on Disney Channel as a kid but I never looked up the last epsiode until I was an older teenager or adult, don't remember when I watched it. Disney Channel was the best back then, they even did cross overs episodes. For example, Miley would be seen in Sweet Life on Deck. It was great! I think Hannah Montana got better when they actually started High School. Fun fact: the actress who play Lilly actually auditioned to play Hannah!
Ok but what about the movies lol
Okay is it just me, but I watched this how daily, each episode at least 10 times and I have NO recollection of the finale? I always remember it ending with her taking her wig off and something to do with Jesse?
You should watch Alexa and Katie
No because I'm also watching Hannah Montana for the first time. I secretly enjoy it
it's definitely a show you need to grow up with and watch from start to finish. I personally was really happy with the ending because lily and miley have been best friends throughout the entire series and it was nice to see miley choose lily over a big opportunity like that, really shows how much she loves lily and she didn't seem to regret the decision either, it felt like she did what she felt was right.
i know i’m late and i’m corrupting the no recommendation policy but you should watch the hannah montana movie because it’s, in my humble opinion, much better than the show. probably you’re not reading this but just in case i just need you to know that ever since i know you, which is honestly a lot of time, your videos have not once failed on making my days better and making me laugh and smile sincerely. you surely know this already but you really do an excellent work on just commenting anything and being naturally funny
Where is he watching this?
I was so proud of the show for ending with the two adults living separate lives but staying friends... and then Miley showed up at college 🙄
no hannah montana slander
😂 the song is catchy
you laughed all the video, you loved it.
Not me coming here to watch a silly video but having my occupation attacked instead 🤡
Some shows become classics and some should remain but a fond memory😂 Hannah Montana really defined my early teens, as a kid I truly truly loved it but I never had the urge to rewatch it and this video made sure I never will.
Dylan making fun of tv that girls enjoyed growing up is stale lol
you randomly popped up on my home page and i'm enjoying this so much. thank you
Bo you shoulda gone for Charred-Zard
honestly cant complain enjoyed the show as a kid but its so funny to hear ur reactions lmao this show really was pure cheese lol
you can't really connect with a show only watching the firsts and last episode, but i know this isn't for everyone
Wait wasn't the last episode where she outed herself as HM or am i wrong
Crazy how he acts like he hasn’t seen any of these shows before not even once. I’ve seen a couple of these videos where he “hasn’t seen or heard of the show he’s watching”
Should do Avatar: The Last Airbender for the First and Last series! Such a good show and the last episode is technically ~1h30 minutes !
You need to watch the episode where she reveals her identity
Please watch a couple episodes in the middle I promise the first 2 and last 2 don’t do it justice 😭
Dylan: "dead mom YESSSSSS"
That ending wasn’t emotional? I’m bawling every time i watch that scene. I teared up watching it just now on your video. You just didn’t watch enough to get attached to Hannah Montana. Hannah Montana is my comfort show. I know every episode by heart. I’ve rewatched it 3x since Disney+ came out. And will probably watch it a 4th time after I’m done with everybody loves Raymond. Amber and Ashley were recurring characters. So was Donsig (the cranky neighbor). Rico and Jackson were toxic with each other and a dynamic duo at the same time. Jesse (Miley’s bf)…there was a whole story with him and how she ended up with him. And yes, they moved houses at the end of season 3 and the start of season 4 Hannah Montana forever. You just don’t appreciate Hannah Montana.
dylan you have to do this to modern family. wed love to see your reactions
6:46 this had me wondering… how did she die? ITS NEVER BEEN TOLD
No you need to watch the first and last episodes of the other seasons
The last episodes sucked the first ones were ehhh in the middle it was great lol
Jackson was definitely the funniest in the series, I wish Dylan could’ve seen more of it
pls don't make fun of our childhood sir, you don't know the impact that this show had on us growing up.
Miley actually did the right choice to live a double life. Hannah Montana could get all the advantages and joys of being a celeb, but once she get overwhelmed and fed up, she could get privacy and live a normal life as Miley.
Anyone else realize he typed 30 year old and not 20 lol🤣
I don’t think you understand how many times I have watched that episode
This is around the time Billy met his current wife.. that’s slowly sinking in
I don’t know, I do agree with you on a certain level but I think when you grow up with a show you just have a different emotional connection to it than when you watch it later on. I do see the cringey bits when I watch the show now, but the last season and the movie still get me extremely emotional :) Maybe that’s just a bond thing, like I said, but I watched it with my friends when it aired in real time, people I’m still friends with to this day, over 10 years later. This show made my childhood a whole lot more happy!
"A 30 year old"...Dylan, don't try to fool us, we all know you're 20
So Miley’s always had that nasally voice🤦‍♀️
I used to watch this episode all the time and I still say “oh yeah, she wants me” all the time 😅
Yep watching Hannah Montanah as a kid is a whole different experience Dylan
are you 30 or 20?
are you 30 or 20?
I’m so glad I found your channel :,)
Dylan stop your nonsense lol this show is sooooo good
honestly i feel like you would've possibly liked it if you were a kid when it was on. hannah montana is considered like one of the god tier disney shows by those of us who grew up with it especially. it's also considered part of the "golden age" of disney channel. I absolutely adored the show and I've rewatched it when i was a teen and still enjoyed it despite the cheesiness. but i think part of why i enjoyed it was because I have that nostalgia of loving it when i was a kid. i mean i went as hannah for halloween at least twice. so yeah i get why you wouldn't like it as an adult watching for the first time, but as a kid, man that was peak television
As a kid, I was a huge Hannah Montana fan. I literally bought the magazine every week with my pocket money and my walls were full of her posters. If still probably never show it to my child. There is so much bad influence in this and just wrong messages they could take with them forever. I learned from that show that women aren't supposed to have body hair because she intentionally grosses people out with it and that's only what I remember. Also, damn, they look really young in this.
can you do chilling adventures of sabrina!
DYLAN IS NOT 20? I'M-
Hannah Montana was never one of my favorites... It is a really bad show... way too loud and campy not in a good way. I always liked Suite Life of Zack and Cody, Kim Possible, That's So Raven, Lizzie McGuire, Evens Stevens.... But I mostly watched the disney channel for the DCOMs. This was hilarious though, thanks for the laughs!!
i only just realized that they changed lola’s last name from lafonda to lufnagle
“They compare Hannah’s feet to Miley’s feet and that’s how she’s figured out.” Now that’s a Nickelodeon plot line for sure
I am watching Jane the virgin for the first time and all I can think of is Dylan’s potential commentary 😂
Still enjoyed the show since I grew up with it and saw the characters grow up too. But it was interesting to hear your intake on it all!
4:51 if Dan Schneider directed this show it would’ve gone that way.
I think Dylan clicked the wrong key when putting the title.  He's clearly only just now 20
I'd love to see you do one on siren
Say what you will, that opening song is incredible
"I HATE the way kids talk ... This is why I want to beat them up!" lmao 🤣😂 quotes from Dylan
The funniest thing is seeing Corbin bleu sitting with actual kids pretending to be their age
I think Dylan should watch H2O just add a the water, it would be legendary
I have a friend that sounds like the guy in the audience when he laughs. We had a q&a for a film that we got to see pre-release and you can hear my friend in the background whenever someone says something funny. We keep telling him he should get on a laugh track
You need to do this with Jane the virgin if you like violence out of nowhere
This was fun to watch! Can you do a first and last of Wizards of Waverly Place? That was my favorite show ❤
can you watch secret headquarters
Well, at Nick it would've definitely been the feed thing 😂
oh god i forgot how good and cringy hannah montana was
Ngl i feel like the last episode was a cheap way to tell kids to go to college lol
the 'stache comment really brings me back to my 12yo bullies, yup
Hear me out, do the jake vs Jesse segment of Hannah Montana. I swear we were all watching on 7/8pm central for that last episode to see who she chose😂😭
"I kinda wish she was caugh by the feet thing", it would have happened this way if it was a nickelodeon show fr omg cause dan-
u should watch the movie
as a kid i used to love this show.  ofcourse, as an adult it is cringe like many other kids content.  but i have such good memories attached to this show that even when i am cringing, i find it endearing
I wish he would have watched the episode where Rico and Jackson are doing all their commentary
can you PLEASE do Shera and the Princess of power??!!! PLEASEEEEEEE!!!! :D
As a child I loved this show buuuuut last year when I tried to rewatch it I had to stop at like ep 2 or so and just watched the episode with the Jonas brothers and went back to watching the Wizards of Waverly Place 🤷‍♀️
Season 3 was where it was at though
I remember when I was a child that guy's laugh was even funnier to me than the actual jokes like I would laugh hysterically because of him 😭😭
watching this and haven’t watched hannah montana since i was a kid and i’m like how tf did i ever watch this?
Dylan cracking up during the transitions gives me life
DYLAN!!! PLEASE READ fun idea: BEFORE YOU LEAVE, THIS IS N O T A SHOW SUGGESTION 😂 So, I was thinking… something that would be really fun, for you and the Trouble Makers, would be for you to add into this series - you also looking up the most loved/watched episode and also reacting to that as well.   There’s a lot of reasons why I feel this would be a good and fun idea but I think you could put together why on your own.  LOVE YOUR VIDS
Dylan, I'm begging you - please do "Watching ONLY the FIRST and LAST episode of *THE OFFICE US*"!
man, i know u need money, but the ads are just... mmmm... a bit too much :')) im sorry
dylan said corbin bleu doesn’t sound right unless its high school musical like that isn’t corbin bleu from jump in 🙄
i would watch some movies with you dylan
I love this guy!
please watch the alternate ending it's like what ????
I know I’m 6 months late but game and rich are dif
Hannah Montana was everything to me, little homegirl me IDOLIZED THIS SHOW. Rewatching it here and there I only care for certain episodes and sometimes cringe at the Disney jokes 💀 but it’s very nostalgic for me
Hannah MOntanta is a great show, but with the first and last episodes, it seems bad. BUt I definitely did not like the quality change in that last season
Wait, wasn't the episode where put wig off in talk show and are accepted to college only after she tell she's Hannah Montana, the last episode???
...because Hanna Montana doesn't pay taxes. Saves way more money than free stuff...
never realized how guilt trippy lily was BYE
I've been here for like how many times already, and I wish you do more Disney Channel/NIckelodeon Sitcoms, like I would love for you to watch the first and last episodes of Wizards of Waverly Place, Suite Life or Zack & Cody, Good Luck Charlie, Sonny with a Chance, Big Time Rush, iCarly, Victorious and more!!
I am so confused by the title, didnt he say on multiple occasions that he's 20?
the weave Miley had in the last season 😭😭😭
YOURE NOT GOING TO PARIS- Michael Scott
I like that it’s assumed Miley wears her clip in extensions to bed
Why is he so good at transitioning into the ads and sponsor parts. its honestly my favourite part of each video
why are his advertisement promos so clean
I never got tired of fangirling Hannah Montana when I was in middle school but then I happen to see the last episode and I realised the show was stupid to begin with. Yours reaction was exact the same as mine. 😭
I think Buffy the Vampire Slayer would make a great First amd Last! Thanks for making this fun series - I watched them all in one day.
You’re the most unfunny Youtuber
He says 30 in the tittle was that a joke because in his recent video he says he’s 20🤔. How old is this man!
u not seeing the drama of the love triangle ughhhh
ms emily got much better with line delivery in dead end paranormal park
Do one for RAGS the Nickelodeon movie but reminds me of a Disney movie lol
I would love to see Dylan react to wizards of waverly place it’s a amazing show and is funny
4:07 that is too perfect
shes still famous, rich, and worshiped....but also gets privacy. hence the whole best of both world thing
It's funny how younger me thought the actors were so much older, and now I see them as babies lol
listen dylan it seemed great when i was 8 years old
Honestly it makes no sense that Miley would go to college like girl why you already have an established career you don’t need college. Lilly needs it because she needs to find her passion
when he started his punchline for the sponsor, i was like LMAOO GET OUTTA HERE while swatting the fking screen and Dylan just hysterically laughing XD
Prepaid laugh 😂 you’re killing me dude
Can you watch Jonas?
Why did I never realise tammin sursok was on hannah Montana😭😭
dylan you have to watch amazing world of gumball, its so unpredictable that you might be able to predicte it xD
Okay you may have a point..or several
PLEASE watch the first and last of Gossip Girl Feel like I would die
I think the episode that held the most emotionally impactful ending was when Miley reveals that she’s Hannah, her saying goodbye to Hannah Montana was devastating for me as a child.
Could you do a commentary to Pair of Kings or Wizards Of Waverly place?
I know that Dylan don't take movie commentaries but I would love to see his reactions to "Now You See Me"
i'm french and at 25:23 you just know that the person who wrote the line wasn't french at all 😂
Omg am I the only one dying with him he’s got me laughing so hard 😅😂😂
You had me dying with the gossip girl episode, so I subscribed 🙂5Am can’t sleep vibes :)
Will you do a first and last of Riverdale
Not Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia commercial play while watching this video...
i didnt really watch hannah montana on a daily base, but after watching your video i think it would be a way better ending if they just went their separate ways and did what they always dreamed of but showing, that they are still best friends. feels like this would have been a better message xd
Dude, I knew my parents and my friends parents would actually see hannah montana on, and be interested in watching it with their kid coz they genuinely enjoyed the show. it had a charm. Is it perfect no. But it's watchable.
You should do first and last of Gilmore girls 😅
Why dont you just get your nose pierced 😂
you should've seen when she reveals to the world she was Hannah
well she does wanna be Hannah but she also wanna be a normal person, that's the whole point of the show, even the intro song, she wants to have the best of the both worls, being a superstar and a normal girl
Hannah/Miley's dumbass disguise makes Clark Kent's/Superman's look like a fucking camouflage. At least Clark can differentiate between the personas of Clark and Superman and not everyone has seen Superman up close and Clark isn't well known figure. With Miley, she still keeps her southern accent, both of her personas have been shown public figure. People never put two and two together.
Now do the originals... Santa has a major role in that one... and after that, do legacies... Santa's daughter has a major role in that one.
You should really watch first and last episode of the good place, because all of the seasons inbetween are a big rollercoaster of things happening
The only thing is: How dare you not have watched Scar Face.  I thought it was overrated, but it really is soooooo excellent! You really really should watch scar face. It's a blast!
I remember watching it as a kid until season 3 then it just got so crappy. Now I know how it ended with two girls being co dependent. Oh man your reactions were mine lol.  Thank you Dylan Is In Trouble!!
Why am I so obsessed with him? Like me being a girl of many celeb crushes he's definitely in the top 10
I feel like TV shows produced when this was written and aired aren't comparable to "regular" TV shows. The divide between Disney shows and regular shows is noticeable these days and 16 years ago it was huge. A lot of what makes this awkward or cringey comes from that. Not that "teenager puts on a wig to be a superstar and nobody recognizes her with the wig off" is a realistic storyline that doesn't require suspension of disbelief today as well, but a show created today with that storyline would've gone a lot different from this one, even if it was made by Disney as well
React to Encanto
How did I not notice Jenna??
you have to watch friends!!
27:11 unless it burns down huh
FIRST AND LAST RIVERDALE
where can i find his @s
8:53  That squeak tho 😆😆
15:15  what Dylan said reminded me of ‘The Song of Achilles’ just wanted to mention it
Do it with "the originals"
"Ah It's hard to swallow" "that's what she said" even when he could barely get it out
This is one the shows that were a huuuuge part of my childhood. Watching it now, it's not a good show but as a kid, I loved it. And that's fine, I guess.
I didn't like the season 4, I think it was awful, the movie was so fuc***g good
wait why does the title say he's thirty I thought he was barely twenty my life is a lie :0
Dylan, you're a child.
My concern is that Dylan is in fact not 30. I'm real confused
Am I the only one who thought this dude was way younger.
Ah the show that the second it was on I’d immediately change channels. 😂
bruh I wish we could send Dylan specific Jake and Miley episodes to react to, I feel like he'd have such a time with those; specifically, the He Could Be the One episodes
Season 2 was the best . U watched both the weak parts of the show.
U just didnt see the good eps bro HANNAH MONTANA IS SO SPECIAL. my childhood❤ The thing with hannah MONTANA is u need to watch a few episodes to actually fall in love with the show. Coz its actually preety funny n has good emotional moments too.
30 yo? I thought you said you were born in 2002?! I’m 30…. And was not born in 2002.
Please do big time rush
Watch victorious
Wait, how old r u?
10:38 but that the whole point. She’s still famous and gets all those things, but she also gets to live a normal life. “It’s the beeeeest of both worlds!”
Is that Jenna BLIND Marshall from PLL??!!
There’s a Rug
I've watched the series was OK back then...now it's 🗑...Dylan Rosting it was fun...
What do you mean you’re old you’re 20
He thought he was going to understand the whole Hannah Montana movement by watching the First & last episodes? And now he's disappointed at the show? 😂
WHY???
WHY???
not me crying at the final scene, while Dylan is making fun of this xD
I loooove this, you always make me laugh
And that is how you make me click on a video
It’s a whole different house
dylan can you do wizards of waverley place
lmao watch miley and kenan thompson's disney school snl skit and you'll understand why lily yells so much. it's funnier watching it back now.
Wizards was funnier lol
Hannah is my childhood. Nothing and no one can destroy this.
I was just thinking about how this dude doesn't bother me with ads and then I got hit with the Honey ad oh my gosh 😭
I literally used to own a 1981 Volkswagen Rabbit convertible and loved it. I know wonder if people thought 💭I was driving a women’s car.
please react to Jurassic park! its a fun movie but really old. (also because of your policies you are now not allowed to react to it whahahahahhahahaha)
I swear, Dylan is going to die while saying a "that's what she said" joke .
ok so in my opinion, if you are gonna watch something hannah montana, it should be hannah montana the movie where she goes back to tennessee
We use Honey all the time. The best!
I loved this show. I watched it with my daughter and then we went see her in her concert with the Jonas Brothers. My daughter was 9 and her first concert. Then in 2019 we saw the Jonas Brothers again. Crazy good! Insane! Best time ever again!
How many times have i come back just to rewatch Dylan scream at corbin bleu? yes.
he sounds like hiccup
The fact that i know i watched hannah Montana, but i remember nothing
You should do a first and last on LOST
u missed the cheese jerky song😭
It was always cringe but so was I 😅🤓
🤐🤫🥱🤦
Fanna montana made me laugh more than it should’ve
As an adult I did watch this series because it had a concept I really enjoyed (dual identities). I feel like if this series wasn't controlled by Disney and a low budget, it could of been really good. It was pretty fun even though there are way too many unbelievable occurrences in the series. Then there's the movie which had promise but also had too many unreal things.
Jason Earls was my favorite part of this whole show
I love seeing Dylan’s pleasure when he fairly seamlessly starts his ads 🤣
When Corbin came in shot !!😭🤣🤣🤣
DYLAN I BEG U PLZ WATCH WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE!!! you’re definitely gonna like it so much better
has anyone told you look like pewdiepie
I love that’s what she said Dylan edition so much
You missed the best part of Rico and Jackson going from enemies to friends. And the Olly and Lily story. 😍
never watched a vid of him before but i laughed a shit ton, also he got the entire show with just 4 episodes but kept thinking he didn’t 😭 like amber and ashley
Wrong network. The feet thing is nickelodeon
I would pay to watch you watch this entire show
I might have been too old to follow this show, I’m in my late 20s now, but it was always super cringe to me, haha. I see how it was probably fun for kids though
Me being pleasantly pleased with Dylan hating the show 😂😂😂😌
Dylan: Only watches the first and last episodes of the series. Also Dylan: “Even the emotional beats just don’t quite hit” in the finale of a series he didn’t watch
Next up should be Wizards of Waverley Place
I just realized I’ve watched about 100 of your videos and hadn’t subscribed but I am now!!
Honestly as a kid, really liked the show. I didnt see them as extremely cool or anything i just liked it a lot.
I just love how Dylan presents de sponsors JAJAJAJ always so good
Imagine college......being ur dream.....aint no way
As someone who only watched a handful of random episodes as a kid when nothing else was on, gotta say, I'm glad I didn't get invested in it lol. It's so bad 🤣
I was so obsessed w Hannah Montana and I didn't even know there was a 4th season. I thought there was a finale in the third season, or the third season lead into the movie kinda? Like they look older here than in the movie so I'm not sure what happened lol
Does Dylan not realize that that’s Oliver?
3:38 fun fact, hearing characters from Hannah Montana mock someone for being a girl and having a "mustache" made me self-conscious about my own "girl mustache" when I was only 5 years old. My brother said "Oh, [my name] has one too". It has become even more embarrassing as I got older and removing it was a terrible idea because it only got worse. So thanks Dylan, I appreciate you pointing out that it's bullying and isn't okay. The writers didn't care and just wrote it because that's just kids being stupid, but it did cause people to make bad decisions because of a single line in their TV show.
dylan pls pls watch girl meets world/ boy meets world im begging on my knees
You have to watch the Hannah Montana movie!
Bro literally Missed out on a whole plot of Jason pretending to date Hannah Montana😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
That guy in the laugh track is David dubrik literally
I guess he needs to watch Hannah Montana the movie if he wants to know why she doesn’t reveal her identity 😂😂😂
It’s me never realizing Jenna (pll) played in Hanna Montana 😭😭
Now what exactly do I do with the knowledge that I NEED to see dylan react to Chad *Dylan* Cooper....
i want him to react to her seeing jake's face morphing into jesse's when she's singing He Could Be The One hahah
8:58 it’s a laugh track, I’ve heard his laugh in several shows.
PETITION FOR DYLAN TO WATCH THE FIRST EPISODE OF SEASON 2 AND LAST EPISODE OF SEASON 3! Best Seasons of the show
$4 an hour feels like a dream to me😓
About the whole not wanting people to find out she's famous thing, I think Ronaldo said it best - being famous gets boring. You can't even pick your nose without someone catching you in 4k.
They recycle the laugh tracks
You need to watch the reveal episode!!!!!!!!!
Can you do one tree hill but only episode 1 & 6
Why do you remind me so much of Felix, but with a more reasonable amount of cussing? (Nothing against Felix sentences are just smoother this way in my view)
The real drama is in the episodes when she cheats on her boyfriend (not sarcasm)
It was my favorite kid show when I was 15
Yes
you should watch the whole show just so you can experience the glorious bucky kentucky
Just watch Scarface, man.
I PHYSICALLY AND SPIRITUALLY CRINGED AT ALL THE JOKES.
i need him to do an iZombie first and last oh my gosh
Official button for dylan to color his hair black
There’s some gem episodes in the show :) The bone dance is a bop
u have to see the part where she reveals her identity
Do iCarly now xD
The way Dylan cringed with fear at seeing Corbin Blu 😆I had to pause the video for a bit to laugh
i recommend watching the movie if you haven't already lol
Sometimes I expect Dylan to comment on the ads as well. Kinda wish he would 😂
Barbie movies when???
YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE MOVIE!!
I think there was beef between the two towards the end of the series.
I just really want him to react to the first episode of "Gilmore girls" and the last episode of "Gilmore girls: a year in the life"
Dylan vs the spacebar a never-ending saga
YOU SHOULD DO A VIDEO WITH THE SHOW VIOLETTA
I love how he misses the whole point when he doesn't understand why Miley doesn't want people to know she's Hannah Montana, because there's so many perks to being a celebrity. That's why she's got the best of both worlds! Because she still gets the perks of being a celebrity while also getting her normal life and not being bothered by being famous all the time, she's not missing anything 🙃
ok you know what i wanna see you react to wizard of waverly place so bad now
Those girls stay tbh lol
Disney only allows one kiss per season so to insinuate that it happened they’d always cover them with random things when characters would kiss
You should watch That’s So Suite Life of Hannah Montana, it was a cultural reset
you should do the hannah montana movie!!! there's some good old third act misunderstanding and it's fun even though it's not even canon lmao
We need u to watch Bridgerton 👀
You should react to Hannah montana the movie
do wizards of waverly place now 🥳🥳
Creepy.
the best show ever idc what anyone says, specially u that u wat hed 4 random episodes and talk shit about It💀💀💀go watch ur euphoria and boob shot vids and leave miley alone
The fact that Dylan DIDNT talk about how his collage was a scam just flabbergasts me
thank you 2.0x playback speed option
ngl, watching this kinda ruined it for me haha but I was like 10 when I last watched it, so I am not surprised this didn't match my memories of the show
Dylan you must react to legally blond
The best thing on this show was and is still jackson
Wizards of Waverly Place next!
You should try watching “Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.” Not only is it the worst movie i’ve ever seen, but it makes up for lacking any plot with an abysmal performance from Lindsey Lohan :)
I haven't watched this show for many years but I do know that you have to watch more than just the first 2 and last 2 episodes to really get anything from it. It took me until season 2 to really start enjoying it and to me, the last season sucked so bad lol especially the last few episodes. They all felt so forced
See, the reason it's apart of so many of our childhoods is because we were children, we didn't see how dumb the show was.....
Should do Wizards of Waverly Place next it’s much better imo
Lol
The nostalgia I felt when I heard that theme song
Hi dylan please do a first and last for the nickelodeon show 'henry danger'
PLEASE WATCH SCARFACE
DO THE MOVIE! for your own critical perspective! definitely not recommending btw just pointing out the opportunity for content
You should watch, "That's so Raven"
you are 30. not 130
everything in the show is great value lets not lie
He said the "say what" joke didn't work cause was too long but he doesn't know it's a running gig and thats the longest one she ever said. The joke works when you know the consistency behind it.
Loved the show the songs are timwless
I could've don't without the joke
That's what's she said through the pain 👍🏿
PLEASE DO A THE ORIGINALS SERIES MOVIE COMMENTARY
He should have watched the interview episode
You are a narcissist? My grandma is a narcissist and she is awful. She got disowned by her own daughter, a.k.a. my mom.
Miley's friend is the same actress as Creepy Connie from the TV show Jessie
Spit take at "Good Joke CORBIN!" 🤣🤣🤣
That into is engraved in my brain forever
Please react to Ginny and Georgia it's just about the cringest show you'll ever see
next up...the hannah montana movie!!!
Did older Hannah wear fake teeth? Her teeth don’t fit her face, it looks like they gave her a fake set to make them whiter or something.
"i like him struggling to find what he's good at cause he's not good at anything... she got all the talent!" this was so funny
U had the AUDACITY to say that this was for children. I'm 24 and still watch it and regularly listen to the songs xD
the hannah montana show isn’t great in my honest opinion, but the hannah montana movie? brilliant. not just the storyline, but the scenery, the acting, the music, the character development, etc. kinda wish you watched the movie instead.
Anyone else see a personal preference from Dylan a little more this episode? 😂
Dylan I know it’s no recommendations, but there’s a show called pair of kings that was a Disney xd show and I think a first and last comparison would give you whiplash
Plz do season 3 of Stranger Things!! Part of the final 4th season comes out next month 🥲
OMG THIS VID JUST MADE ME REALISE LIKE OK SO I WAS WATCHING PLL AND I THOUGHT I KNEW JENNA FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THEN I JUTS SAW THAT ITS BECAUSE SHE PLAYED JACKSONS GIRLFRIEND OMG WAIT AH
You missed the very last scene. Emily/ Lilly add libbed the last word of the show
Try to watch Sonny With A Chance.. it's also a disney series like this.. Demi Lovato is on it...
btw, jason earles (her brother) was 28 in the pilot.
I never realised how loud Lilly actually speaks till Dylan pointed it out 😭
nah you missed out you didnt even see jake :(
Hanna Montana wasn't part of my childhood. Thanks to you I know now that I didn't miss anything ^^u
go watch wizards of waverly place
Totally correct. Hannah Montana is definitely a sequel to Scarface.
Watch the movie!!!!
I always binge ur content i love it so much
If you haven’t already you should react to the movie. That’d be great!
You should watch the first and last episode of Shameless it’s my FAVORITEEEEE SHOW I’m not sure how much of it you’d be able to get ont YouTube tho😩
"Oh, dead mom? YES!" is the moment I was sold on your channel.
Watch the movie Dylan 😀
i'm glad i watched this as a young teen, because now, i would honestly not get in to it anymore. ALSO Dylan you should watch wizards of waverly place
Not gonna lie. The pilot is awful. But it Figured it self out through out the show. The last season was unnecessary. And yeah not a great way to end the series should of ended with the movie
Do it for ‘Wizards of Waverly Place’
I just like one specific era.....
just finished Never Been Kissed on Disney+ and it’s definitely a movie you’re gonna want to criticize🤣🤣
This laugh track with the one loud guy is used in so many Disney shows lol
react to heartstopper
The long joke only works if you have seen the other seasons, because she does that a lot. It like a recurring bit.
You will never know the show unless you grew up with it
might just be the nostalgia factor but i rewatched every episode over the summer and it still held up. it is better in the middle of the show. and the love triangle was a big part of it.
Could you do this type of video with Shameless US ?? 😍 Really fun series !
Watch the first and last of scream queens
Modern family next pleaseeeeeeeeee
When I was younger my older cousin told me that Hannah Montana was going to suck my soul out of me.
Honestly Jackson, Rico and Oliver carried the hell out of this show😂
Dylan can you please watch Victorious the show’s literally my childhood
okay Dylan I have to say this, I am obsessed with your videos. This last 2 days I have not seen my series because I'm seeing your videos and honestly I'm a little concerned because this can't be healthy. Also I think I am more fluent in English because of your videos I didn't know but I was this good in English because I understand every single video
Odio que en español nadie reaccione a series de disney, Solo conosco a un youtuber que hacer criticas :c
I think the hard part of show like this, the end is always gonna be bad because they need to finish and tie the show and the put humour on the back burner
There was honestly so much better episodes than that throughout the show
Video game tester(QA) the only job with worse pay for work and treatment than being an actual game developer.
I remembered Lilly being pretty manipulative from when I washed the show as a teenager and this reminded that she was worst. The moment Miley's narrative didn't fit hers, she got mad. And I know she did good things as a friend, but that doesn't take away the fact that she was rough around the edges
You should watch Bluey
Should do first episode of suite life of zack and Cody and then last episode of suite life on deck
the middle is the only good part of the show though, beginning<middle>end
20:06 “You like this chain? 3 dollars 😎”
This man play with my childhood. Hannah Montana middle season were amazing. The beginning and end aren't
Okay,but these: Starstruck, Cloud9, Save the last dance, 10 things I hate about you and Down to you 😌
The 'feet' plot line might've been a thing if Hannah Montana was a Nickelodeon Show. Just saying 🤷‍♂️
I will not stand the Hannah Montana slander.
i actually remember my friends reacting to the final episode of this show. we were young girls in the EXACT age demographic, and even they were like; what was the point of miley going back. they definitely should have ended up following their dreams separately since that was the payoff of the whole arc and the way to satisfyingly conclude the show (but said like how 12 yr olds would say it). like they found it frustrating that miley went to college, even though it’s SUPPOSED to be the fanservice-y ending for the kids  kids arent stupid. we might not know when we’re watching WHY something feels off on a scriptwriting level, but if it’s done badly that still comes across
It's been so long since I've seen this show (probably since it still aired on Disney Channel), but I remember really enjoying it. Seasons 2 and 3 have more development and is all around higher quality. Not gonna lie though, these episodes brought back a lot of memories.
I'm sorry, but I just LOVE Dylan's sponsorship videos... He has the most unique ones I've seen so far.
Dylannnnn Watch The Movie🙂 Its really fun
That’s what she said 🙄
i agree, the middle is the best part... jake, cheese jerky, oliver jackson and rico XP so funny!
Please react to Heartstopper!!!!
You should watch Pirates and the Caribbean. Justice for Johnny Depp!!
Has Dylan ever watched Smallville on this channel? That’s another CW show I would love to see hime talk about
COMMENTARY SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS!!!!! PLSSSS
watch ant farm
If you want to watch a crazy movie, Slither is one that gives me nightmares every time.
Lily and Oliver's kisses were never actually shown on the screen/wee blocked which made it a running gag that was really funny
I Heard it I heard the guy's laugh
Please react to wizards of Waverly place next.
Hey Dylan love you and your videos, very entertaining fun and funny to watch
This is really random but can you watch the movie “ready or not”
watch wizards of waverly placeee
Watch stranger things season 3 !!!!
Dylan… you have to watch The Ultimatum on Netflix. PLEASE
Dylan Hannah Montana is the second best Disney Chanel show ever, you gotta watch the whole series
PLS watch the hannah montana movie
Dylan I beg you to please watch black widow or encanto
Watch the first and last episode of Revenge!!
I feel like this show is best and most nostalgic in the middle tbh. oh well haha
We need a heartstopper commentary!
you should watch heartstopper
There's a new Netflix series called Heartstopper. You have to watch it.
I was a kid when I watched Hannah Montana. I only watched it for the women on the show.
Wizards of Waverley Place was and is the best show on Disney channel. I had so much sass growing up from Selena Gomez. I feel like Dylan would fall in love with Alex Russeo 😂
I hate Disney+ interface, glad to see I’m not alone.
Can’t believe he missed the epic crossover with the Jonas brothers.
Ok but like the movie is actually kinda good. It’s the only movie I’ve seen with my dad in theaters where he hasn’t fallen asleep and after it was over my brother and my dad looked at each other and said “hmmm that wasn’t actually that bad.”
Season 2 & 3 were the best. This show was my childhood
Why did you go from season 1 straight to season 4? :/ You missed out on the best parts lmao.
Dylan, this show's audience makes up 90% of your fanbase
I think u should watch Brooklyn nine nine, Cause I bet u will like it!
NAHHHH!!! YOU REALLY NEVER WATCHED HANNAH MONTANA?!!?!! It was(&still is) the ONE OF THE BEST SERIES TO WATCH
You gotta watch all of it 😂
Can you react to the three idiots?
Man, he completely missed the cheese jerky song that Jackson and Rico did and it's very upsetting
The show is independent and not a sequel. Also her name was not originally Hannah Montana.
You basically watched the worst episodes 😂😂
Try the films hannah Montana
dYLAN you have to watch Enchanted, man
Dylan watch the "legend of the seeker" it's a nice series
PLEASE DO PRETTY LITTLE LIARS FOR YOUR NEXT FIRST AND LAST you will be utterly confused
You have to do the movie
Can you watch shadowhunters? But  like you did it with Harry Potter?
I forgot how powerful the Oliver glow up was! More power to him!  Dylan guessed the running gag of Oliver and Lily never kissing, but missed the context clues. Classic Dylan! 🤌
Lilys a bad friend convince me otherwise.
Can you please watch the book of Henery on Netflix
watch the hannah montana movieeee
PLEASE REACT TO DIARY OF A WIMPY KID!
i haven’t watched a single episode of hannah montana.....
not you saying the longest "say what" joke ISNT FUNNY!!!!!! bruh that's an iconic moment
Please i loved this show and still do bc of nostalgia but now I'm realizing  this codependence thing did influence me. and also there was a  lot of yelling on this show lol
You’re right, he is quickly gone after the first few episodes.
Bestie we need you to react to Bridgerton season 2 ✨
Hannah Montana is only enjoyable when you're way too innocent. This is spicy for innocent personalities. I had one. Had.
the corbin comment sent me XD
I need this man to do a review for the venture bros
You should try and watch True Blood it’s a pretty good vampire show
Bro 19:50 Dylan everybody who grew up with Hannah Montana knew that those musical transitions were iconic 😂😂😂 me n my sister still use them to this day.
can you do a commentary vid on Cruel Intentions please?
I think u should watch the first 2 episodes of Cobra Kai and the last 2. It's 100/10
The hold the Hanna Montana theme song still has on me…
I am French, and I can certify this "not pregnant" woman is not
Best add transition by far💀
You show do all of the Star Wars movies
"the emotional parts don't hit, something's off" hmmm maybe the fact that you skipped 4 seasons???
Hi Dylan! Can you do Brooklyn 99 because I feel like you will like it?
Damn talk less please
You should do shows like suite life of zack and Cody and or suite life on deck, boy meets world, wizards of Waverley place, I Carly, Henry danger
Shadowhunters first and last !!!
Hey can you react to Pirates of the Caribbean ???
This show is still my childhood I was OBSESSED with Hannah Montana. I had a WIG a Barbie doll. A Hannah Montana one and a Miley one. I had a blanket. I was all about it
I watched Hannah Montana as a kid, and I tried going back to watch it for nostalgia, and it was soo bad I couldn't get through the first episode lmao
You better watch the Hannah Montana movie too! I loved it as a kid. Not sure how I'll feel about it now though...
I didn't even knew, that this was the last episode. I thought the take off wig in the interviev was the last one
40 year old tries watching Jessie 😂😂😂
NOT a recommendation but I think you’ll love Hannah Montana the movie 🤣
Wow those kids grew UP. I kind of remember having a crush on Emily Osment as a kid because of this.
trust me, it is that hard. I live in Nunavut LOL
wizards of waverly place>>>>
nah the way she went to college just because of lily?? bruh if this was real life, there would've been so much resentment and stress built up over the four years. especially if miley hadnt even vhosen a major she wants to pursue
I haven't watch the video yet and just liked it
Okay, don't judge me but I remember being 14 waiting for the new episodes to air on Disney like super hyped 😭😭
Dylan first two seasons were so funny lit and teaching lessons for children and teenagers after that 😑
Do Zoey 101….. pls
you should watch st.trinian’s xxx
you should react to hannah montana the movie
Watch the Hannah Montana Movie!!
PLEASE DO "The Lost City". Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum are fantastic in it.
WATCH THE MOVIE
This feels like watching my grandpa analizing a kids TV Show. Cringier than the actual show ever was
Plz react to first episode of mako mermaids
Please make a Reaction to how to train your dragon 2!
14:49 ...I just love that you actually know how a fetish works, Dylan😏
i beg you watch good luck charlie 🙏🏼
Dylan please watch Korean drama boys over flowers
the problem with this show (and pretty much every other disney kids show) is that if you didn’t watch it as a kid, you’re never going to enjoy as much. to me it brings the biggest wave of nostalgia and i could shamelessly watch all 4 seasons just because of that feeling.
It's part of my childhood for a reason
1:54 I can still copy Lily‘s lines, down to the squeal Lmao 🤣
You should try Wizards of Waverly Place 🙏🏽
Does anyone remember that scene they filmed when the show ended in that girl dreaming the entirety of Hannah Montana through her Barbie’s??
just found out about this channel and you got an instant sub! Used to watch Hannah Montana when it was first airing(ages ago), now i'm  almost 29 years old and am watching this 30 yo watching it for the 1st time haha xD HM is cringe but don't care, growing up sucks =')
"it doesn't feel impactful" ... it might've meant more to you if you'd watched the whole series
AHaa CoRbIn
you should watch first and last of Make It or Break It. currently rewatching it and its fkn wild
Arthur and the minimoys!!!!!!!!
omg is he 30
Why did they voice over lolas name wasn’t it lola love handle or lola love good or something
To be honest, I know a lot of the shows that were a staple for my childhood are gonna make me cringe- it's just different watching it when you're a kid and when your older and can understand things you didn’t before
this show is so much funnier and better in the middle, I would so recommend
I'm not here for the Hannah Montana slander sir.
Is anyone gonna tell him about the episode where miley talks to her mom's ghost 😂
Do Suite Life of Zack and Cody next pls!!
Do wizards of Waverley place!!!
I kinda like how he's not even phased about Lily and Oliver being a couple cause last time he saw Oliver he was just getting over Hannah
im so sorry………. but how rare is a 100% tomato score and a 100% audience score on rotten tomatoes??? cos Heartstopper, one of the best things to exist ever!! has that! and it’s british so you can make fun on the voices
Thankfully I've seen (not really watch) this show in dub and not realized how annoingly loud this Lilly girl was!!
Honestly forgot how bad this acting was
I like Hannah Montana but it's no Suite Life of Zack & Cody or Waverly Place. The superior 2000s Disney shows imo!
You should watch the the movie
this show shaped me so I’m too biased, im glad you watched this 🕺🏾
MAKE A MOVIE COMTRARY ON FRESH
my covid induced near delirium makin me laugh twice as hard at dylans commentary lmao i am cacklingg
I’m so glad he commented on how loud Lily is in the pilot, makes it so hard to watch lol
If you want to be a part of it, don't watch the first and last episode because for shows that drag on longer than they should always have the worst beginning and ending lol. The good stuff is always the middle
if im not mistaken, the show was originally gonna end with hannah montana: the movie but then they managed to convince miley cyrus to do one more season, which is why s4 feels so off
Hannah Montana movie react pls
i have just come to the realization that you have never reacted to DUFF and I think that's a crime
hey Dylan how abt instead of watching crummy stuff, u can watch some anime? I highly recommend Your Name😊😊😊😊
You should watch wizards or waverly place
Try watching the Hannah Montana movie! It’s much better than the series.
it would be great to see dylan's reaction to "the wizards of waverly place"🤭
Used to binge this show as a kid, hilarious! Even remember going to see the movie. I love Miley especially in The Last Song.
Can u react to the second how to train your Dragon movie plsss
this was hard to watch lol
the do it made me get honey!
Was excited to react to the movie 😢
I'm 29 and I just finished rewatching this and I still had fun with it 😂 The last season is the worst one tho and it kinda lost its charm there.
“Miley, don’t make me go see my favourite singer without my” *inhales*  “BBBBBBBEST FRIEEEEND”
so like we're all in love with Dylan?
Dylan watch the movie Fresh PLEASE
Dylan you have to watch Encanto!!!!! its the new best disney movie. BETTER THAN TANGLED!! your next reaction better be ENCANTO!!
WATCH EUPHORIA ✨
"I know it's a kid show so it probably won't go that route" 30 seconds pass "I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO HIT HIS HEAD ON THE ROCK AND DIE"
I want to see you do this with Boy Meets World and Girl Meets World
@dylanisintrouble review Wizards of Waverly Place Selena Gomez does a better job at acting 🎭 delivery
@dylanisintrouble review Wizards of Waverly Place Selena Gomez does a better job at acting 🎭 delivery
@dylanisintrouble you should definitely review Wizards of Waverly Place I was never a Hannah Fan
@dylanisintrouble you should definitely review Wizards of Waverly Place I was never a Hannah Fan
@dylanisintrouble you should definitely review Wizards of Waverly Place I was never a Hannah Fan
5:25 The self awareness that I’m here for 😂
Dylan you need to watch Sonny with a chance and Wizards of waverly place!!! you will really enjoy it
dude I almost shot salad out of my nose when you shouted at Corbin 💀☠️
Bitch the movie was iconic
I think it's more of a nostalgia thing. I didn't watch Hannah Montana, my husband did 😂😂. Anyhow, I watched the entire series of Lizzie McGuire when Disney+ first started because I LOVED that show in middle school. But now I'm more on board with her parents 😂. My mom is showing 🙈🙊.
you would love wizards of waverly place
You like this chain…?  3 dollar 😎
He needs to see the alternative ending, I'll love to see him commenting on that
I was too old to deal with the bs drama of the show. But yeah that ending is toxic. Never give up your dreams for others.
Dylan surprised he doesn’t fit the community of 10 + yr old girls in 2000s
The first concert I ever went to was a Hannah Montana concert when I was a wee lassie in the third grade. Was the most popular kid in my class for like a week
Please can you do "wizards of Waverly place" and *good luck Charlie"?
Dylan HAS to watch the Hannah Montana movie. it is TOP TIER
It would be nice if Dylan did That's So Raven. (Not a request because I know he hates those 😁)
I know you hate recommendations, but honestly I don't give a fuck, you should watch the cheetah girls movies
Both a cringy and funny show 👍
This dude must have been living under a rock to be THIRTY YEARS OLD and not have watched this show when it was on the air. And Jason Earles looked very good for his age. Many didn't even know he was as old as he really was in reality so the fact that you suspected that by the first episode where he looks really youthful is skeptic as hell.
u gotta watch the one were she takes the wig off
I feel like one of the most memorable ending episodes was when she went through her closet looking at all her clothes. With I'll always remember playing in the back. it gets me everytime. Way better than the real finale
Just a cool idea- you should watch the first and last episode of Jane the virgin. Your commentary would be hilarious.
dylan’s “ew” after the “✨hugs✨” is killing me 😂
It was emotional after growing up watching it trust me
Dylan: I don’t understand why Miley doesn’t want people to know she’s Hannah Montana Theme song: Do I not exist to you?
Now do That's So Raven and Suite Life!
Dylan, you have to watch The Hating Game. It's based off a book and it's basically like a fanfic with Lucy Hale. The acting is bad, the writing is cringy and the characters are weird. I would love to see your reaction.
WOWP is superior
THE IMPACT Hannah going back to college with Lily was way bigger in mi head...
I will always love this show because of the nostalgia and the good memories I have of being obsessed with it as a child. But I get that watching it as an adult, it's not going to have the same effect, especially if you're watching for the first time.
Omg it's jenna from pretty little liars???
The way Dylan was definitely an Oliver in middle school 💀💀
Why are my childhood movies and tv shows better when I was younger.
Ummmm, DYLAN IS 30?!!?!?!!!?
I think it’s shitty of Lilly to get mad at Miley for doing things for her career 🙄
THE WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE IS MUCH MUCH BETTER BELIEVE ME
He most definitely should watch Danny Phantom, but he shouldn’t watch Phantom Planet. He should watch the Ultimate Enemy
Hey,can you react to fast and furious ??it doesn't matter which one .just one movie if you can,please!!!!
It might not be the same to me anymore but I will always remember the feeling this show got me🥲
Please do the Hannah Montana movie
"oh yea this is a kid's show" proceeds to completely forget that it's a kids show
Haha, they would totally do the foot plot if it was a dan schneider show ;)
10:26 “yeah see yah bitch” 💀
The hold this show had on me though. It ended when I was the same age as the characters going off to college. The nostalgia is so real
Let's make him watch Wizard of Waverly place people. LETS MAKE IT HAPPEN.
He should’ve watched good luck charlie😂 way better
10:19 lmao😭😭
Watch batmam
Dylan joking about that one dude in the laugh track getting his life was so funny, but Dylan becoming the dude laughing and hating himself for it was even better.
The movie is so much better
Yeah you ruined it for me🤣🤣🤣😭but it’s all love Dylan✋🏾♥️🤣🤣
PLEASE do this with h2o
Why is lily also missing a tooth in the first scene when she skates in. These people are like 14/15, why are they missing teeth
Dylan's be like "You like this? You like this chain? 3 dolla!"
I think you are full of it... You have a good time watching and complain it's bad in the end. Hmmmm. The ending wasn't amazing. But the plot of sitcoms isn't what makes the sitcom good 🙄 stop the crap. You saw worst then this
So you definitely have to watch the Hannah Montana movie now
hannah montana was everything and i've loved miley since 2006 and never hated her through all her eras <3
You bet I knew when to close my eyes during the second episode.  That blue gum gave me nightmares
You need to do the same thing for wizards of Waverley place!!!
I think the dude on the laugh track laughing super loud is DAN SCHNEIDER. Run!
U CANT TELL ME U ARE 30 BUT HAVE NEVER SEEN THE SHOW B4 I thought everyone around that age/my age would have at least stumbled about it and stopped a little ONCE IN CHILDHOOD xDD
You missed the two boyfriends drama episodes wish you watched those too😂
REACT TO HANNNAH MONTANA THE MOVIE!!!!
Dylan I feel like we were all watching this when we were pre-teens so we didn't know anything about plot or character development 😭 I think it's fair that you don't like it because you are like 30 LOL
24:42 I mean, Dylan is basically Jackson of Hannah Montana, what can I say... So Dylan is two Disney characters combined now: Flynn Rider and Jackson Stewart (Miley's brother). Lol.
Can you please watch H2O just add water?
DYLAN PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE watch some of the middle episodes 😭😭 Watch the Jake v Jessie saga pleaseeeee
Please, Can you watch h2O (just add water)??
The fact that you don’t know it’s a laugh track and not a real guy laughing in the audience, is so cute!! 😂😂😂😂 To be fair the guy was busting up, about 70 years ago when it was recorded lol
I remember that i cried in the last scene when miley and lily hugged eachother but i was mad because i couldn't see the big kiss between oliver and lily 😂😂
DO THE OTHER TRAIN UR DRAGON FILMS
I did not watch did show. Zoe 101 is the real thing :)
You should definitely watch the Hannah Montana movie!
this is a definition of Hate Watch
You still need to watch the 1st and last episodes of CHUCK. 😁
React to Wizards Of Waverly Place!
you need to watch the movie now
5:59 😭😭
The best part of Hannah Montana is their daily life situations
You should do The wizards of Waverly place <3
The last season was actually terrible, the first few seasons were the best ones. I even feel like you were laughing more with the first 2 episodes but the last 2 fell short, it was definitely rushed. Like they had to figure out how to end it nicely but quickly.
I loved this show when I was 7 years old but I only ever watched the 1st and 2nd season I think
I love the fact they're was actually 30 seconds of Dylans video left when he said there was 30 seconds left of the last episode.
I’m rewatching Hannah Montana as we speak and so many nostalgia feelings are coming to the surface! 🥺 this show still holds up to this day! IMO! And I don’t know about the rest of you, but to this very day I’m bitter how things ended with Miley and Jake! HOW COULD THE WRITERS RUINE SUCH AN ICONIC DUO BECAUSE HE CHEATED ON HER! 😒🥺
I'll always love Hannah Montana don't know why just will and do lol
i know you hate this comments....BUT PLEASE WATCH THE MOVIE
Honestly didn’t really just how bad this was 😅😅😅
PLEASE react to Phantom of the Opera it's one of my fav movies and I cant find any good reaction videos on YouTube
you're allowed to show that you're a nice person
honestly the last season even my child self didn't like it, it really showed that Miley was over it at this point
Please watch the Lizzie Maguire the movie
The funny thing is that I haven't watched Hanna Montana in years but I still got hooked to watching it from Dylan's video like how I was back when I was a kid. This is my childhood right here.
The first half of the first season is not as good but the back half of season 1 and the rest is stil hilerious to this day im 26 and stil find it funny its just this 1st couple of episodes thats just not doing it
Free Dance 2018 plz!!! It’s worst movie ever
I think the 4th season was a little different from the rest, the last episodes of season 3 could also be watched as the end of the show.
First time? Rlly?
You should react to Drake & Josh😭 it'll be hilarious
Wizards is so superior that I can’t even
The emotions don't hit you BECAUSE YOU SKIPPED THE WHOLE SHOW!
I was obsessed with Hannah Montana, I dragged my dad around the mall looking for the Hannah wig, just to be disappointed it looked horrible and wasn’t even how it looked on her head. Had all the CDs an posters, listen to the songs on road trips driving my family crazy 😆 watched her concert dvd of her touring on the road with her family. I remember when her CD had real developed photos of her as Hannah with her signed signature
Since when is Dylan 30??
Hannah Montana was one of my favorite shows when I was younger, still to this day the Hannah Montana movie is a fav of mine lol
memories memories !!!soo funny watching this older  and  with you😆For next time can you watch the wizards of waverlyplace please 😁
*off key* woooahhh woah woah woah HHH Also imma need you to react to the achy jakey episodes.... Maybe that will turn you to be *chants* one of us! One of us! One of us!
PLEASE watch bridgerton! S2
WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE NEXT!!!
THE VOICEOVER LMAOO
Watch the Hanna Montana movie, it’s more watchful
watch wizards of waverly place, that show was my childhood more than hannah montana lmaoo 😭
Have you done wizards of Waverley place?
He didn’t even get to see the the better parts of the show
If you have the opportunity to go to college before a recession, take it.  My mom and I went when the job market was awesome and than when we graduated, the jobs were scarce.   Go when you know you will a better opportunity at a job when you graduate.
I loooved Hannah montana growing up, my mom took my sister and I to see the Hannah montana/Miley Cyrus tour lol but I’ll admit, prob wouldn’t go back and rewatch the show 😂 it’s part of my childhood and that’s exactly where it’s gonna stay lol
You should watch young and hungry.    Lily in this show also plays in that show and I personally love young and hungry 🤤 😭😩
This just made me miss the show... I really shouldn't start rewatching it.......
This just made me miss the show... I really shouldn't start rewatching it.......
I’m glad I’m not the only one that wants to throw their laptop across a room when the space bar doesn’t work on Disney 😅😂
You completely skipped over the essence of the show. I lived for the Jake Miley Jesse drama
Dylan you need to review Everything Everywhere All At Once when it's out digitally next month
Watch Young and Hunger then. I do know you have a long list…
it was way better when I was young. watching it now... it sucks lol
watch Wizards of Waverly Place please!!
17:12 😂😂
Dylan hear me out the Hannah Montana movie I need the commentary 👀🤍
Please watch “vacation - we are the griswolds”   I nearly died of laughing!🤣
When I was watching this as a kid, I used to think Hannah looked mature. Now as an adult, I only now realize how tiny Miley was :o Also apparently Hannah Montana was supposed be called Alexis Texas, but the name was already taken by a porn star 💀
TV show: intentional humor Thus guy: this is like unintentionally funny.
Watch The Batman
Watch that’s so raven!!!! Way better
i almost couldn't watch this bc i didn't know if i could take dylan making fun of my favorite show
Watched this video and immediately got an ad for Nintendo Switch that read "testers wanted" lmfao I can't
why did u not watch in order consecutively this ruined my week
8:54 dylan i love you
The pilot was better than any of the other eps🤧
Ok now so the movie
I love these videos and Dylan if you ever just wanna fully watch a show I’d be down to watch that too. Not sure if it’s something you’d be interested in but these videos by themselves are great.
DYLAN!!! THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. ok sorry for the all caps but is this a Mandela effect or something I swear you've done a comintary on the devil wears prada but I can't find it. Please tell me in not crazy
I was so obsessed with this show I was convinced I was gonna grow up to be hannah montana🤣 I had all the merch on the market and I still know every song by heart🙈
Iconic video moments:  The nose ring 1:30 That’s what she said 10:16 Honey sponsor transition 10:45
I'm not gonna say which I'm hoping Dylan will do next, because then he'll never do it, but the other Disney Channel classic would be so good
Hanna Montana walked so Miraculous Ladybug could run
I will always think that Hannah Montana: The Movie could have been the perfect ending to the show. Not only because the last season was my least favorite but it felt more emotional, had better production and storyline, I liked Miley's love interest in the movie more than who she ended up with in the show... But what is more important to me is that I HATE how the movie it's not cannon to the show. I mean, what happened to Travis? The dad's girlfriend? How everyone kept Miley's secret and no one revealed anything or sold out to the press? Something that really bothered me was that.  When she took off her wig and revealed her secret to everyone, it was more shocking than when she did it on the show. It's definitely something they shouldn't have done twice because it took the magic away from the most important plot of the show.  IMO it should have ended there, but if Disney wanted so much to continue the series after the movie, they should have done what they did with half of the 4th season and show what Miley's life is like after everyone knew her secret, but the fact that she took off her wig for pretty much the same reasons she did in the movie was meh, especially since it worked out so much better in the movie.
When I got Disney plus I started the first episode of every show I watched in my childhood and the only one where I actually made it through 4 seasons was Wizards Of Waverly Place (oooh plot twist). Now that show still has plenty of cheese and cringe but the others had so much more I— 🥲  I honestly believe the reason Hannah Montana is still talked about today is because the majority of the songs, if not all, that came from the show were absolute bangers (no pun intended😂). He could be the one was one I played on repeat as a tween girl with a middle school crush. I digress. The songs were the show flat out— hence why “Hannah Montana” performed actual concerts in real life and not just not just in this fiction show.
Can u watch star wars??
I definitely liked the movie the best, it was much better than the show and a huge part of my childhood.
Dylan u just don’t get it 😪🤷🏻‍♀️
You should do a commentary on Encanto.
DO WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE
dylan pls react to bridgerton :)
the fact you missed the whole jesse v. jake thing really upsets me
cmon this was a first and last ep
Me from San Antonio 😳
Ok, who's up for Dylan reacting to Wizards of Waverly place!!
I've been binging this show all week
No but seriously, the rage I have for the stupid site is beyond what it should be. They are literally a billion dollar company AND THEY CAN'T EVEN HIRE A DECENT WEB DESIGNER---  also I vowed to never watch my childhood shows (mostly disney) because they are just so cringe so this'll be fun
Review life with Derek 😬
okay now watch the first and last episode of euphoria but do it with both seasons!
ngl you ruined hannah montana for me..so many red flags....
I think the thing that makes a finale satisfying is all of the things in the middle. So, yeah. Oh it's own did that finale feel unsatisfying. Sure. But to me, it was, and still is, the cherry on top of a journey of found stories and memories.
Try using the 'K' key instead of the space bar, that should help with the frustration 😂
I feel like you would love the series Hannibal. Very twisted, very dark, well-timed urinal joke... perfection
Ummmm  watching this as an adult, Lilly is kinda a hella toxic friend. At first glance that thing she does when leaving is kinda funny, but when you think about it it's kinda manipulative, not to mention shes one of those crazy fans that breaks into celebrities dressing rooms, shed probably show up at Hannah's house if she knew where it was. Then in the last few episodes shes clearly not thinking about Miley's happiness so it doesnt seem like she gets better over time.
I never realized I didn’t finish Hannah Montana until recently lol
It must be so awkward to secretly be a celebrity and your best friends are your biggest stalkers
Hannah Montana was a character to clean the family money all along? How did I too get hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hood winked, lead astray!!!??!!
I feel like bullying a bully is just self defense
Do Umbrella Academy S1, the family members are lowkey savage to each other
I hate kids...it's why I want to beat em up 🤣🤣
please update your picture
He literally watched the episodes that are the least indicative of Hannah Montana as a whole. That's hilariously sad.
Dylan, you don't look 30. I would say at least 25 years of age.
Thanks for watching it so I don’t have to! I didn’t have cable as a kid so I saw like two episodes max growing up. Now, wizards if waverly place, on the other hand, I have binged as an adult. Best Disney channel live action show
❤️❤️❤️
"I feel like every kid show should have an adult version with like a murder mystery" Dylan you KNOW the CW exists don't steal their content 🤣
Ok but if dylan only knew about all the singing transitions
Daily Reminder: JESUS LOVES YALL ❤️ 💝💗💕💛💝💖💚💓💕❤💌💛💖💝💙💌💓💖💝💗💘
lowkey want him to watch jessie
i thought hannah montana was a movie? theres a show about it to?
Literally i hated how the dad favored Miley the whole series. And the random cameo by Corbin Bleu? This whole series was insane.And i also knew that Miley would NEVER sacrifice anything for Lilly because the whole series had her as her priority. Lilly deserves better than Miley.
Hannah Montana will forever be my favorite childhood show
Literally beta testers get paid horribly, have forced crunch times and don't have any job security. The equivalent of a temp. xD Not Disney going "HEY THIS JOB IS THE SHIT. CONGRATS, JACKSON."
I’ve never seen Oliver and Dylan in the same room now that I’m thinking about it 🤔
King Julian took over Dylan 😂😂
do wizards of weverly place
I mean now listening to alot of those jokes as an adult alot of them are really bad. But again kids from all ages were watching so... and it is a really good show but I'm sorry with this just only watching the first and last episode obviously you're not gonna feel anything for it. And alot of those jokes are funny to kids. But again as an adult I was cringing bcuz now understand some of them and others that weren't that funny anymore now being adult. Bcuz I watched every episode of Hannah Montana back every one. I loved it! But that's why I can't watch most cartoons now bcuz my brain just can't do with the really stupid stuff. I only so Anime but I don't consider Anime as cartoons though they're so much better and even though they make some more kid like that are on nickelodeon or whatever but of course the more adult like anime
i would love to see him do a commentary on starstruck the movie
This came out when i was starting to outgrow these kinds of shows. I grew up prefering Thats So Raven 🤷🏻‍♀️
lol i get nostalgic and watch it like once or twice a year. if you watch it all the way through you get to see the character development but other than that, it's not anything but a corny kid's show. the value is basically just.... in the nostalgia. especially for pre-teen girls at the time lol
I want to see you react to santa clarita diet, come on, two episodes...
2:23 I WASN'T EXPECTING FOR THIS SHOCK, i'm dead, that was so funny
i really need you to watch killing eve i feel like villanelle was LITERALLY made for you
I hated this show as a kid for reasons that will be obvious if you read my name, seeing it again years later didn't do it any favors 😂. The only thing I remember liking is her dad.
you should watch pretty smart from netflix the actress who plays lily is in it and it's sooo silly
8:42 Dylan fangirling over the loud laughing audience member is my favourite thing ever
dylan...watch the fifty shades of grey movies
Hannah Montana is top tier. I still cry instantly at the last 5 min of the episode
Once Upon a Time would be extremely funny with the first and last episode 😂 or more like first two and last two 😂
This show was fucking awful beginning to end, and you bet I watched every episode of it as a kid lol.
“see ya bitch” 😂
Her mom's played by Brooke Shields
Dylan is playing  with  my favorite  childhood  tv show
Dylan is 🥵 and he wasn’t along for the journey so my 8yr old inner me is outraged with this commentary but me now respects this commentary
4:51 maybe if dan schneider wrote this show
“I hate this guy it reminds me of me” Dylan nooo 😭
Dylan, in response to Lily talking really loud you should watch the Disney Channel acting workshop on SNL!
Corbin Green lmao
POV me skipping the ad "with honey.." skips ad "do it" 😂
yas dylan! i love that you did a Disney Channel show!
Never watched hannah Montana, watching Dylan reacting to it is hilarious, one of his best commentary
wait until Dylan finds out the laughing audience is edited in
ok but what did dylan actually say during the voiceover
I'll always love this show because I grew up watching it. It has a special place in my heart and honestly the music is good LOL. hannah montana, wizards of Waverly place and suite life were my shows. Now that I'm 24 I can still binge them and enjoy them. I also loved Lizzie Mcguire but that was a bit earlier.
honestly I like Hannah Montana but it wasn’t my favorite show to watch growing up. Wizards of waves place was my favorite and I think it was better
Emily Osment (Lily) was in an ABC cyber bullying movie. Just fyi
You must react to wizards of waverly place
Season 2 and three are like the best seasons
Dylan if you are 30 and Miley is 29. This should’ve been your childhood also.
Stop giving me vietnam flashbacks from your location all the way to Germany here please, thanks.        _jk_
Maybe we don't want you being a part of our childhood after all.
me just noticing Jason’s gf is Jenna from PLL HAHAHAHHA
You should watch euphoria 😂
The rewatchability of the movie is MUCH MORE and holds up better than the entire series as a whole
NOTHING WILL BEAT THE MOVIE THE MOVIE IS SO ICONIC
First episodes were funny cringy but funny . Last few just, weren't. But pll jenna is here :)
You’ve never seen Scarface??
What is Miley even going to college for???😭😭 You're a pop star. You have enough money. 😂😭
Child me definitely saw the show through rose colored glasses lol I know you don't take suggestions but eh, been curious what would a foreigner opinion on Monica and Friends (on Amazon) bc I think it's going to be barely understandable for people who didn't grow up with the comics (and cartoons, manga, etc) lol
Please make a commentary on the Hannah Montanna Movie,   It‘s going to be so much fun! 🌚
How DARE you skip the intro
YO DYLAN WHERE GONNA FIGHT!!!!1 THAT'S MY SHOW YOU'RE CRITICIZING
hannah montana is a sitcom so there is no ''flow'' between the scenes.. just saying
please watch wizards of waverly place
I don't get the "oooooOooOooYYeeeEAhhhh" sound effects for EVERY transition. I don't know how my mom put up with mr watching that religiously. As an adult now, that would have made me want to die. 😭😂
That Scarface joke right in the beginning made me laugh way too loud 😭😭😭
I think Dylan should watch disney channels ZOMBIES next because it would be hilarious. I think he would actually love it
such a shame he's not gonna see the cheese jerky episode
This was my favourite show growing up, it feels so nostalgic watching it now.
I never noticed that Miley had her nose pierced in the later episodes I’m surprised they let her have it with it being Disney
My favorite part of the show was Miley’s love interests
I think it was actually quite smart for them to cast jackson as a character. He was able to film more, so him having his own moments with nico probably helped with filming and allowing the younger cast to get breaks.
Te quejas de que la broma no funciona, pero es que tampoco te viste la serie!!! Es parte de toda la serie 🥺✨💜  Y si. Me arruinaste Hanna Montana 😡
Never seen any of this and now I don’t have to! Thank you Dylan ❤️
Dylan: It's hard to swallow Me: hehehe thats what she said Dylan: THaTs wHAT ShE SAiD Me:👁👄👁
Now you have to watch the movie
Dylan did you know that Miley and Lily hated each other in real life, it’s probably why the acting feels so forced
i LOVE HANNAH MONTANA
You really watched the worst parts of the show lmaooo i can't breathe  EDIT: Dylan please watch the Hannah Montana movie please it's iconic and a lot better than the episodes you just watched 😭 would love to see you react to it!
It definitely is harder to watch as an adult but I absolutely loved the show as a kid. The Hannah Montana movie still gets me but the show I'm not as interested in
Where was this kid in His childhood? He has not seen anything
I remember to like Dylan's video immediately after the sponsorship bit because omg wow lol   😂
hold up, it said continue 😏
She was like 11 in this with all her baby feet still falling out haha
I love Hannah Montana but as much as I love the finale ending it would have been nice to have a more mature ending and Miley and Lily go their own separate ways but the show ends showing them still staying in touch and deciding to visit each other or just staying in touch. Lol
So six months after this show goes off air, he becomes a karate Sensei on the show Kickin' It and he seems pretty successful lol
Dylan can you please react to Zeke and Luther.   If it's ok with you ☺️☺️
I’m sad that Dylan missed out on all the music. Nobody’s perfect slaps.
I remember watching this when it came out and I was like 5, so for me I love it because that’s my childhood. Watching it back, it’s cringey as hell, but I still love it because when I watch it it brings back how I felt all those years ago. I also used to have the Hannah Montana wig and pjs and stuff, so it was my shit.
Dylan I need you to start a choices series please I binge watched love island the game and I loved it 🕺🕺🕺
This show was my childhood. And it's all about Miley having decide does she go the Hannah way or the Miley way and all her closest friends and family have to suffer with what ever the teen decides... Up until they need to be two separate people
DONT DESTROY MY CHILDHOOD
It's not impactful because Mileys character was a spoiled child that got everything she wanted all the time and never earned it. You're probably feeling that shallowness.
Dylan should try watching Barbie movies
This finale is still as frustrating as it was years ago when it aired 😅 I feel like they should’ve learned how to be individuals FINALLY 😒
Watch fresh
did anyone else have the exact same reaction as dylan to corbin bleu entering the scene😂?
Dylan skipping over the most emotional part of my childhood has ripped me apart
I’m binging HM rn and its crazy how Miley truly never learns ANY lesson 😭😭 shorty is so childish and selfish its crazy
why does YouTube go 🥳 when i leave a like wtf is this now
You’ve gotta do TWD when it ends this year
this show always sends me back to the 2000s watching this on my friend’s box tv
Oh no I thought u were watching the movie !!!
Watching it now with Dylan I can see the loopholes but I loved it then and will always be a great kids show
Jesus what DID u watch ?
I think it’s obvious that Miley and Emily didn’t like each other by the end of the series
i died when Dylan recognize that fellow's laugh in a background, so hilarious
please do Zoey 101
like everything else on TV, Hannah Montana started out good and just grew boring and uncreative over the years.
game tester here: I suppose what you said is true, but depending on the project you work on, and your managers; in my case, it felt weird at first how our managers and higher ups would explicitly tell us not to stay overtime, unless we sign up to work overtime during milestone weekends (and even then, nobody was obligated to sign up, I never did, and still got promoted)  the pay does suck, but it's alright in my country, and a good job for students or young people, plus if employers see a big name game company on your CV, they'll jump in to recruit you for themselves  personally i'm having fun so far, only worked for a year now, got promoted in under 1 year, and the team is fun, plus I get enough free days to rest, and the company respects the holidays period
unfortunately, that's the humor I was growing up with :'D So I still think it's funny xD
Remember that being famous means no privacy and it’s probably really hard to trust people.
my brother and sister loved it so i'd watch it, but yeah, it was definitely my least favorite disney channel show
plz reactad 2 south park "bigger longer and uncut"
The problem with the last episode is that it's about fan service, not storyline.
DEAD MOM?? YESSSS!
Dude watched the worst parts of the series as later in S1 and S2 are way better, ppl didn't connect with it initially but aa it progressed it got better, the worst was the finale, the real finale of hannah montana was s4e9 not the actual ending, I'd recommend another episodes of the series and not those watched, hannah montana is the show that aged better from disney alongside that's so Raven and suite life but you gotta watch the good ones not the worst ones
It so weird seeing Miley Cyrus and Emily Osment so young again
Omg do wowp 😭😭
this show sucks compared to others you should watch wizard of waverly place that show which im currently rewatching is soooo funny
Try using the "k" button for play/pause
The show had some good moments but def aged oddly. The music is great, mixed up, don’t wanna be torn, I wanna know you, I miss you 🤟
I don't remember watching the last episodes, but back then and even now I really loved the first seasons episodes, like the first seasons and the movie are my childhood and I remember rewatching some episodes with my little sister but that's the magic for me, never getting to the final episodes😂
His reactions to the transition sounds 😂
Try watching Good Luck Charlie. I recently rewatched it and it holds up surprisingly well compared to other Disney Channel shows.
“Dead Mom, YES!” 😱😂
Please react to more Hannah Montana
u HAVE  to watch Wizards of Waverly place now. In my opinion it’s better then Hannah Montana.
My little sister was obsessed with this show when she was growing up. I never understood the draw to be honest, I always found it to be super annoying.
i'm sorry but dylan's scream when he saw amber and ashley is the highlight of the video why is no one talking ab it
i feel like the real finale was when she revealed she's hannah montana
wizards of waverly place next? 👀
WHY DID I NOT SEE THIS ON MY FEED
i liked it up until she revealed herself and then it was bleh
When your name is Montanna so the video is really awkward for you because you have to listen to your name 24/7:
Not gonna lie with the glasses and hair I would have no idea shes Miley 😭 🤚
I wish he would’ve watched the last 4 episode bc the REAL finale was the last 4 connected bc you got to see her struggle and finally realize she has to tell the world her identity
BEGGING YOU TO REACT TO HANNAH MONTANA THE MOVIE
YOU SHOULD WATCH FHE UMBRELLA ACADEMY
Dw you definitely ruined it 😂😂
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!!!!! You NEED to watch the movie frequency with Dennis quaid!!! It’s one of my favorite movies and it’s a nice suspenseful thriller/mystery!!!! Or do a pirates of the Caribbean marathon!
You should watch the first and the last episode of Once opon a time
Yeah never got the hype for Hannah Montana, the one Disney show I was really obsessed with was wizards of a waverly  Place. So good
I remember when I was in middle school I said that Hannah Montana wasn't really my thing and I didn't enjoy it and a teacher yelled at me for just being a contrarian to be cool. Like bruh, maybe I just don't like Hannah Montana. Never said it was good or bad but now I really don't like it.
you should do the movie pleaseeee, I think you would like it more
the idea that he had a Scarface correlation is funnier than the video 😂😂😂
Thé prison épisode is one of the funniest Disney episodes ever
React to Hannah Montana: The movieeeee please
As a 13 yr old girl who’s younger self was obsessed with shows and movies like Hannah Montana, even my 5 yr old self suffered while and when watching the movie. And I continue to suffer through it. I’m now currently an emo so I think it’s going good <3
dylan: you're stupid enough to get scammed also dylan: literally went to a scam college
If you didn’t watch Hannah Montana as a kid, you already missed the Hannah bus. Like you said it could be better. The jokes were lame. And It’s definitely nostalgia that makes it good.
I’m really confused. Does Lily think she can’t take a gap year? Why on earth would you miss out on an opportunity to live in Paris for a whole year??
<3
real talk tho hannah montana was good but its one of those shows i would never go back and watch
omg it would be amazing to react to austin and ally 😭 because till this day dez makes me laugh, he really had something against ally 😭
My sister and I would watch this with our baby sister and she thought of this show so seriously and while we enjoyed it we would find the deliberate humor as cringe and the accidental jokes were so amusing to us. The scene on the rotating closet 👩‍🍳😘
The show is def funny when you know the context, although I do agree the first eps are not the best. But it def has funny AND sentimental eps. Funny enough, Oliver and Jackson were some of the funniest to me and still are, but again you didn’t watch their best eps.
The third to last ep would have been better than the last 2. Bc that’s her big reveal. The last 2 eps are too relationships based and small call backs for fans, which you do not understand bc you didn’t watch the show.
Dylan forming a 1 sided friendship with someone's laugh..
Please watch 50 shades of gray………….
Hannah Montana was one of the last Disney Channel shows I watched before I gave up on the channel. Nothing Dylan or anyone says will ruin my love for it.
THERE IS NO WAY YOURE 30
in 20:07 I just became the person in the audience with the distinguishable loud laugh and maybe I'm just on a dumb mood today but other BTS ARMY will get why I laughed at the 3 dollar chain comment lol
YOU RUINED IT FOR ME. XDD I haven't watched the show in ages and  you made it soo lame  lol XDDD
Does this mean he’s never reacting to the movie😭
I always preferred the movie over the tv show.  I wasn’t a fan of the show.
Dylan! DYLAN!! Can you pretty please with a cherry on top, react to Fresh with Sebastián Stan 😃
Wasn't there a finale season after this called Hannah Montana Forever where she reveals her identity finally?
Dylan!!! You missed the Jake vs Jessie triangle drama!! Gotta watch the “He could be the one” episodes!!!
27:09 Celebrities taking a break from fame and going to college isn't that bad. The Sprouse twins did it and they're still famous
Jackson is the best character of the show
I'm starting to think Dylan's college was a scam
Can you watch all the maze runner movies?
27:40 and that is the reason why Liv and Maddie beats the crap out of Hannah Montana
I liked the beginning of this show, because they committed to the ridiculous humor. The latter seasons just didn't work out for me because they tried to a have more 'down to earth' aspect rather than just leaning into the comedy.
There’s a movie of Hannah Montana
“Lily” became a better actress later in life despite all the goofy movies and shows
Yeah all the bad jokes and such sucked but I will never forgive them for the extensions they gave Miley in the last seasons
YOU SHOULD WATCH THE CROSSOVER EPISODES
I just KNOW if he saw all of it he would actually enjoy it.
Jenna.??????!!!
Get on a Wizard of Waverly Place train 🥰
I think the reason they added the last part where Miley goes to college is cause through out the entire series we see Lily going along with Miley's dreams and I guess this time it was Miley's turn to go along with Lily's
Daily Reminder: JESUS LOVES YALL ❤️ 💝💗💕💛💝💖💚💓💕❤💌💛💖💝💙💌💓💖💝💗💘
uuu
You should watch Kickin It. It has the same actor who plays the brother. He owns a dojo.
Disney humor is just lele Pons humor glorified
I was legit obsessed with this show from like 6th-9th grade. Looking back, you weren't wrong about the characters honestly. I rewatched the show back when Disney+ first came out and it wasn't as good as I thought it was at the time but I did laugh (though mainly at the cringe factor vs the jokes). Overall it's a show that definitely isn't 'great' but I agree with your assessment that it's cringe but also a bit endearing.
I think the show was a better drama than it was a comedy. Jackson was the only REAL funny part of the show
Not Dylan missing the whole “you get the best of both worlds” thing
Just watch the movie 😂
Dylan Dylan Dylan you should 100% try and watch “everything everything” I think it’d be hilarious
You should react to emperors new groove
do zack and cody
No Dylan you ruined it for me 😂😂
Just remember that Miley was twelve when this show aired. Also, they moved. 😂
If Dylan doesn't find a away to insert how college is a scam in his videos, he can collapse 😭
Why was he itching for that dead mom back story? Finally his blood lust is satisfied 😂😂
That Oliver foot discovery joke would've totally worked if this was a Dan Schneider show
Dylan saying he didn’t see the appeal even though he watched biting of it 🤣 most of the popularity of Hanna Montana it’s the nostalgia and following the growth, like Miley and Jake vs. Miley and Jessi
At this point i've seen him watch so many shows he has never watched before, I kinda want to know if he even had a TV as  child.  No, but for real, it would be a cool thing to see shows he actually watched.
It's crazy how much i remember from that first episode  O.o
Dylan getting excited by a laugh track... lol
Next you should react to wizards of waverly place. Alex’s humor is gold
Do a marvel movie for first and last 🤍🤍
I just realized there was an end to this show and I never saw it. I googled it, apparently, it ended in 2011 and I'm like ah yeah that explains it. I was 17 years old I wasn't watching much tv by then. wow.
Love this series
Jackson and Rico were literally the best duo in the show and Dylan didn't even get to see how iconic they were
HOW HAV U NOT WATCHED THIS HAV U NOT WATXHED THE OTHER OG SERIES EITHER??? i’m shook no way
Hannah Montana was my *CHILDHOOD* but I never realised how cringe it was 💀
I know you hate recommendations but there’s this one movie named Thumbelina that seemed to be right up your alley sorry
I was thinking “oh yeah I’m gonna love this” and i ended up realizing it wasn’t as good as I remembered. I used to you adore this show lol, thank you dylan😂😂😂❤
They should've ended the show with Miley telling everyone the truth. They could've even kept the college storyline. It will always baffle me why they made the decision to have Miley's secret exposed as a mid-season storyline instead of the series finale since the entire series was based on her secret! Doesn't make any sense. Many of the episodes don't hold up anymore but the show was really in its prime in seasons 2&3. I think what really stopped this series from being a miss was the father-daughter aspect, the music, and the endless merchandise opportunities.
watching the world find out hannah and miley was the same person shaped my childhood
ok, but now you need to watch the movie, it's sooo much better!!!
Can you watch the movie fresh?
Watch the movieeeeeee
You should watch the Hannah Montana MOVIE! That is better
Best of both worlds is a certified banger.
Dylan PLEASE turn up your sound, it's so low compared to every other channel --- like if you want him to see this
It probably sucked to you because you haven’t watched the whole show. You didn’t watch it through the years, so the ending obviously would not be impactful to you, but great reaction!
Thats so raven is funnier 😂❤️
Dylan now you have to watch the movie 😏
you should watch the cross over between zacl & cody, the wizards of waverly place and hannah montana!! its so good
Movie Request: Hey Dylan, I just watched this movie a while ago and was wondering what you thought of it because... Anyway, It's called 'I Am Mother' on Netflix, maybe check it out?
is that a new shirt i see dylan wearing?!
Lily was a selfish and jealous  friend
Dylan should have watched the episode where Miley reveals to the world that she’s Hannah. That was the big emotional payoff in the final season.
Pleasseee watch the movie it would be iconic
"I'll never be able to go to college with my best friend again" like... you still can, just start later than her!
the mistake this final season made was repeating a plot line that we already had (revealing her identity in the movie), and then adding a month's worth of episodes past the "reveal" that didnt really amount to anything 😭 it should've ended with a TV movie instead of almost 7 episodes of nothing
Dylan that ad for honey was smooooth, like damn.
Hannah Montanta was such a weird show for me, because even watching it as a kid the humor was so cringy, and I would not admit to anyone that I watched it because everyone knew it was bad. And yet, I watched every episode (except for the final season) multiple times. I thought the premise was a lot of fun
Just the fact that Fabio did not come back from the pilot still hurts me
Please do Cruel Summer 🥺💗
He is the best. Because of him not bowing the plot his guesses are well there are no words
I actually think because this show is geared towards children, that they felt a need to end the show with the idea that school/education is important, more important than the cool/fun thing to do. Like realistically, Miley has a career already, she doesn’t need to go to college, but kids watching are gonna think college is not necessary and parents/adults/schools don’t want that message pushed.
Like a month ago I got stoned and watched the first like 5 episodes for the first time & it was transcendent tbh
Can you do wizards of waverly place ?
You’ve got to watch the best film ever made now … the hannah montana movie
Dylan, you can only love it if you saw the whole thing lol, its a slow burner, 3 episodes wont do that..
do icarly please
Omg you should watch the Hannah Montana movie👏🏽👏🏽
I used to be obsessed with the show as a kid and oof, it's so much worse than I remember haha. Like Lilly's voice was so high pitched it was insane!
I feel like Dylan would love Austin and Ally and Sonny With A Chance, like Dez and Chad would be his favorite characters!
20:20 his disbelief 😭 he looks so bewildered 😂😂🤦🏽‍♀️😂 And the second episode with her chewing the gum and her teeth and lips coated in black BROUGHT BACK FLASHBACKS. I loved that scene as a kid, coz I was mean to all my little boyfriends in school at the time and she was being mean to him and he was being needy and I was like... SHE IS JUST LIKE ME. I loved it🤪 I WAS LIKE YES BREAK HIS HEART.
Ok, I don't know if you've already done this, but you should do the Suite Life of Zack and Cody!  It's kinda dumb, but I grew up watching it, and would love to see your take on what sort dumb shit the get into.
low key season 3 is the real ending, watch those final episodes dylan!!
The excitement for the dead mum 😂
The fact that Dylan is so good at sponsor transitions is honestly so frustrating. I’m flabbergasted every time
I hated Hannah Montana growing up mainly because I was a wizards of waverly place girl. But I will admit she had good songs and the show was okay
I laughed way too hard at “Corbin green”
It's hard for me to believe Dylan didn't watch this before.highly suspicious
i wish you can also react to the movie
DEAD MOM??? AAAUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHH! 😩😩
I thought of this while I was half asleep but you should watch the first and last episode of Merlin
if hannah montana was written by dan schneider: 4:39
now watch the movie
"Give Sanny a chance" is muuuuch funnier xd Personally I don't like Hannah Montana too:^
You missed the best arc of Hannah Montana when I actually was obsessed w the show with Jake Ryan and her
This is my dream come true.dylan watching my fav show as a child.its gonna be so cringy now after all these years
I don't think they've ever showed the last episodes or season in my country lol  Should've ended it after the movie or something. Not sure what happened afterwards
So FYI Stanford does not like their name used in media. They famously turned down the producers of Legally Blonde for the movie to be set there, which is how it ended up being set at Harvard instead.
Ugh, WHY?
As someone who was the targeted audience when this show came out, I can say I stopped watching Hannah Montana in real time when the last season aired. It felt like too much change and I just was not interested. And it seems like I made the right call.
dylan neeeeedss to watch the movie omg
Scarface👀
I loved it when i was a kid but it is dumb obviously 😅
I’ll just say. I always liked Jackson’s story more. He feels more like the neglected child, never gets a win, always gets made fun of. It’s kind of sad really.
It's a kids show Dylan. It's not that deep
I wish you react to Wizards of the Waverly place because that's my favorite childhood show and I like it even now when I'm 22 but you probably wouldn't as you hate recommendations BUTTTTT it's your life Dylan, don't let recommendations decided what you don't watch (stolen from Lilly ehm)
Even i haven't seen till s4 so I have no clue 😂
I loved this show, it was silly and cringey, but in the best possible way!!! I was a nanny and was introduced pretty early on, but I definitely continued watching on my own! Lol if I was ever sad I would put this on and just laugh and feel like I was young again.
Wait, i thought Lily & Oliver were siblings!!!
Jerizerd?! I can’t believe you didn’t say Charitard
The fact that there is no reaction to Oliver and Lily dating! IT’S OLIVER!!!! C’MON, HAVE A REACTION
DYLAN
OKAY NOW IM WAITING FOR DYLAN'S REACTION TO "THATS SO RAVEN" !!!!
Dylan is slowly ruining my favourite show ever for me. How is the "Said what" joke not funny??? It was even her longest one!!
the designer is her teacher for the rest of the series but no one notices for some reason? maybe theyre twins
2:23 Dylan's face when he sees Corben is priceless😂🤣
Is Oliver Ned from Nickelodeon?????
Do Gilmore Girls :D :D :D
Dylan watch the episode with the Jonas Brothers 😂
Please watch wizards of Waverly place it's the best Disney show
Do the Hannah Montana movie Dylan! 😂 Then do Wizards of Waverly Place next! and the WOWP Movie 😂
dylan: "I would absolutely love to hear [that I've successfully ruined Hannah Montana for you]" xDD
You need to watch and comment the movie as well. PLS!!!
This show isn't for everybody, that's true. But I've seen it through the eyes of a 6 yo who grew up with it and idolised being a teenager and having the kind of life depicted here. It's one of the best parts of my childhood and it holds a special place in my heart.
Yeahhhh this show wasn’t the best and kinda never made sense with the whole wig is a complete disguise thing but it’s such a staple in my childhood that it’s almost inexcusable.
I've never seen "Hanna Montana" and, I'm montanadiana for 20 years, now. I will skip further posts from this irrelevant site. A bientot.
to be honest hannah montana was not my fav as a kid.... i was more of a wizards of waverly place kinda gal 😂
I use to love HM growing up I'm now 26 and haven't seen it in yrs!!! This has just pointed out to me how stupid and un funny the humor was back then. So YES you ruined HM for me but really it ruined itself. No wonder I would mostly watch water book repeats of Avatar the last air bender hoping and praying it would be a fire book episode!!
i only watched it cus i only had disney channel as a kid. even tho i liked cartoon network much more. my parents didnt have that cable plan, so i would cherish being at friends house
Oh my god please watch the Hannah Montana movie !! It’s actually so good!
i personally really liked seasons 2 & 3 – the characters were fleshed out, the jokes were funny, and the plots were good too. season 1 was definitely the most boring season & my least favourite of the 4. i think part of the reason for the bad line delivery is because miley & emily were very young (13?) and were just starting to find their voice in acting. in seasons 2 & 3, they start to feel more comfortable with their roles and the acting feels more natural than forced. season 4 is definitely on the boring side, but it was intended to be a sort of nostalgic closure for fans of the show – that part i think they achieved well. i remember tearing up a lot when i watched the last season because they did a good job with the nostalgia of it all and kinda tied up everything in a nice little bow. plus, the season 4 soundtrack is STELLAR – absolute favourite album of all the seasons. the acting feels off because at this point, miley was trying to break off from disney (this was her "can't be tamed" album era) and create her own path in the music industry – she also said that she felt disconnected from the character because she had matured a lot and felt uncomfortable in the role of a teen girl in a kids' show.
The closest just reminded me of chronicles of Narnia.. I am gonna go watch it RN 🤩
Please react to Wizards of Waverley place
Dylan laughing at his jokes are equivalent to AOT Sundays
So, I'm from Mexico... $4 USD per hour for testing games sounds so much better than... well, the best paid job I've ever had
Please do wizards of waverly place!!!
lol I love this show and completely understand and agree with most of your criticism
to be honest i dont even remember there being a season 4
I was obsessed with Hannah Montana as a kid but upon rewatching as an adult, yeah the jokes don't really land much.
time for dylan to watch the hannah montana movie
i never know what to expect from  these videos but I'm never disappointed
His reactions lol
We both said “that’s what she said” at the same time 😂😂
23:05 wow....I really relate to Jackson a lot now that I'm older....
omg you have to watch the hannah montana movie you gottaaaa
Imagine if he saw the episodes with the Jonas brothers or the Jesse and jake choice and Roxy
looking back now I'm very confused as to why Hannah Montana is just performing in the same place once a week for the first season, like did they give a 13 year old a residency??
I can't believe how easily I am tricked into watching so much of Hannah Montana........ you better make up for this Dylan. You should watch--just kidding; I know the rules.
Everyone in school called me Hannah Montana in school🙄hated it. So glad this show disappeared lol
Oh my god YES
Dylan please watch the Hannah Montana Movie!!!
he needs to react to that’s so raven it’s SO much funnier
Season 2 and 3 were top tier.
Do Wizards of Waverly Place
I liked this show to an embarrassing degree XD like I had a Hannah Montana bike helmet with her face plastered on the helmet
I honestly don’t remember watching the last season and I wonder if my brain just decided to eliminate the files, if that’s the case after watching this I can understand why lmao, but the first seasons were icon tbh, they’re dear to my heart, especially because Hannah Montana and The Suit Life were my favourite series of Disney
Jason Earles and John Cena are the same age. That always blows my mind.
Superior show
The girl who plays Lilly is actually pretty great at comedic content…there is another sitcom called “Young & Hungry” and it is great! I mean it still is cheesy at times but for a modern sitcom it is nowhere near as cringe. A lot of the storylines are actually pretty fun and the jokes and cast are great highly recommend giving it a try.  I honestly was absolutely against watching it because having grown up in an era of sitcoms I was sick of them and found them extremely annoying, cheesy, etc…But I’m soo glad that a friend who kept telling me to watch it put it on one day when we were just hanging. And I ended up getting super into it.

this is my childhood you're playing with Dylan
next reboot is them trying to break her out of Scientology
for me these werent even the last eps lol also the midle seasons were 😚👌
This guy sucks even more than the show he is condemning.
I was too old for the whole Hannah Montana movement…so I was a hater and made fun of all the Hannah Montana merch and songs and this and that. I mean there were even full grown adults into Hannah Montana which is weird but her too each their own as long as you aren’t hurting nobody what do I care?!  BUT NOW LOOKING BACK I think Miley Cyrus is one of thee most talented people to ever have come out of Disney. I think she is hilarious in real life and my god can she sing!!!!!! I don’t understand how someone can hear Miley Cyrus sing and say nah she sucks. I mean you can just not like her style of music or singing or voice BUT to say that she can’t sing or whatever is ridiculous. She has a massive range as well as a range in the genre of songs she can sing. And is just such a powerful singer with an instantly recognizable voice.   I haven’t been a Miley fan forever but I first started coming around to her when she released the controversial Bangers album. I loved it! Was is thee highest brow music choice…no but was it catchy and did she sound incredible hell yeah. After that she has only gotten better and better vocally.   And is a really great live performer who sounds just like the studio versions of her songs if not better at times.   Ok I’m done being a simp hahaha… But as far as Hannah Montana goes I think it is that era of Disney where the writers said the cheesier the better. Not that previous Disney content wasn’t cheesy…just that it was slightly less cringe than that era of Disney Channel originals.   But nobody can deny the intelligence on both Disney and Miley’s family’s parts…they made soooooo much money from this show and character. I mean Hannah Montana sold out arenas. What other character from a kids show is doing that? I mean I’m sure there are some that sold out shows…but I doubt anyone comes close to the sheer money printing power of Hannah Montana.  I think that that honestly sort of f’d with Miley for a while. Because she was still just a kid and wanted to be one but I’m sure she couldn’t most of the time because of the fame, responsibilities, and rules and regulations put in place by Disney to uphold her contract.
Hannah Montanna is epic for those who grow up with it, like me. I'll always remember how emotional it was to see her reveal herself and to see the movie... it was amazing. Also, I would LOVE to see react to Sonny with a chance (I believe that's the name in English, I'm from BR), it was my fave Disney  show as a kid
YOU HAVE TO REACT TO THE MOVIE NOW
The reason why she doesn't want to be known as Hannah is litterally in the Theme Song: You get the best of both worlds....Aka she gets to be a normal kid while also living any child's dream, being famous!
why was it this video that made me think drew roy (jesse) kinda looks like adam brody
that transition into the sponsorship ad was smoothhhhhhh
You get the limo out front...
I recommend Wizards of Waverly Place. The humor is kinda better
imagine how he would react if he watched the alternate ending
I know you don't like recommendations but you already watched How to Train Your Dragon. Please watch the sequels!!
Why do I keep letting him do this to me ?
"it's not a real school" I wonder if dylan can relate
Fun Fact: The kid that plays Miley's best friend is the same kid that plays the lead role in the horrible movie Cyberbully, and the plot is pretty much the title. It's about a girl who gets cyber bullied so bad to the point that she tries perma-ban herself from life  I didn't realize it was the same kid until 7:06 when I got a clear view of her face and went "...wait a minute-"
I never liked Hannah Montana as a kid, I tried to watch it but couldn't do it, because I was an overly critical brat and thought it was so bad  I still think it's bad but now I'm an adult
My thoughts: I’m realizing now as an almost 30 year old millennial that this was a great example of how badly the “you NEED to go to college” idea was pushed on us constantly. 🙄
I remember watching some of Hannah Montana as a kid. But it was something that I lost track of over time. I guess I didn't really vibe with the drama between her double life as a pop singer and teenage girl.
corbin was actually in a few episodes of the show  i loved him on the show
Dylan needs to watch wizards of Waverly Place he would probably like it and the finale is way better.
Please watch velosipastor
Thanks for ruining my childhood! No, seriously, thank you!
6:38 somebody tell Dylan to watch the Beetlejuice song "Dead Mom" 🤣
This show was so cringe.  Also, she could have filmed the movie and then join her friend for college. How long does a movie take to shoot? 4 months no?
PLEASE do wizards of waverly place
I get what you are saying but growing up on Hannah Montana is the best
Please react to Zoey 101  !!
omgg i love his sponsor transitions lol😂
Thank you Dylan, this was priceless!! XD  The middle episodes are the best. Please watch Season 2 Episode 9: the cheese jerky episode.  And Season 2 Episode 13 shows the heart of the show really well. Bonus: Selena Gomez plays another popstar who ends up being enemies with Hannah Montana  Also Season 2 Episode 20 has Dolly Parton involved in a full-on brawl.  Please give the show another chance!! I'd love more commentary.
Everyone basically said everything in the other comments but I wanted to feel included and so here I am...
I use to love Hanna Montana when I was a child when I tried rewatching it a year ago I realised how horrible it was IMO wizards of waverly place is much better and funnier
to be honest this doesn't feel like art, like a series where a director and the cast wants to tell a story, this just looks like it is, a disney product design to sell garbage to kids. I'm glad Miley Cyrus could escape this and create her own brand doing art.
DYLANN! You should watch CODA. Good film, won best picture at the Oscars (; would love the commentary
Dylan you should watch Anastasia. A Disney animated movie
you didn't ruin the show for me because i tried to rewatch it a few months ago and that ruined it for me
Ok, but the songs are still bops, I’m 24 and still turn up to Nobody’s Perfect, Who said, One in a Million, This is the Life, We Got the Party, etc, etc 🔥🔥
People probably mentioned it before me but there is an episode where she wishes she was just Hannah.  Also the movie made me cry so those emotional beats hit? But I was also nine when it came out so.
There was something about watching the whole thing and waiting every week for the new episodes along with the occasional drama. Def corny but I could see myself rewatching and still enjoying it
Is Dylan telling me that this show was filmed in front of a live audience
This show brings back unwanted childhood memories, like the theme song my life flashed before my eyes
If I have a logo design for you, Where do I go to reach you? I have no idea how to get ahold of you if even possible 😂
WHY IS SHE YELLING???
tbh i spent more hours playing the ds games than watching the actual show :|
Do Wizards of Waverly Place!
now you have to watch wizards of waverly place!!
Watch That's So Raven next
the portions leading up to your sponsorships are so great lol
The way I stop everything to watch your videos
I watched all four seasons in real time and never realized Miley is actually kinda a bad actress…
Plot twist, dylan is the audience member who's laughing
plz do wizards of waverly place😌
PLEASE react to wizards of Waverley place you’ll love it so much more
wizards of waverly place>>>>>
This bish has been 30 for 5 years
thanks for ruining my childhood
not even 30 seconds in and I'm dying lmaoooo "hannah montana is tony montana's daughter" XD
the ad transition is always so seamless
When I was in 5th grade my older sister (who was born in 1998 and grew up watching the show), really wanted me to watch this show. I didn’t want to watch it at first, but I eventually did watch it. 7 years have passed since then, and it’s one of my all time favorite Disney Channel shows. And I love watching it with all the people I know, my best friends and their mom, my Dad, and my older sister. And you can tell that my Dad really likes this show, and that he’s not just watching it because I’m watching it, because he’s been watching it for 16 years (since it first came out) and he still laughs really hard every time. And the music, I love the music. I dressed up as Hannah Montana for Halloween one year, I read one of the books. And I know this comment is already really long, but I got to once again mention my best friends that I like watching the show with. You see, their names are Hannah, and Emily (they’re sisters) and not that I was there to see it, but Emily dressed up as Lola (Lily’s alter ego, Emily Osment’s character) for Halloween one year. 😊🙂😊
Do wizards of waverly place next please. Best Disney show ever
But the Jake and Jesse episodes!!!! 🥺
U gotta watch the movie
please watch wild child
This was not the end, the end is on another series called Hannah Montana Forever
i still love the snow because of the dubbing
I got a add for perfume done by Miley Cyrus half way through this! Lmao
The weird thing about this lore is that Hannah Montana exists in the universe of the show, which we are watching, but after this became a hit show, Miley Cyrus did tours as Hannah Montana irl. It's inception and we're just the extras.
it actually bothered me that dylan spoke about the one guy being in the “second to last row” and then proceeded to edit said guy into some row in the middle.
Why?
The honey sponsorship introduction was AMAZING I COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING
LESSS GOO MY FAVORITE SITCOM
“Oh he’s the kid that died in that one… ...I love that one” 💀💀
You need to watch liv and Maddie first and last
Wizards of Waverly Place >>> Hannah Montana
Honestly the last season of this show was a fever dream. The movie was honestly good though. I mean maybe not good, but definitely better than the the last season. Lucas till was also 😘🤌🏻 Also the girl who played the bully character “The Cracker” went to school with me. Her sister was in my class.
I thought I was the only one with the Disney+ space pause problem hahahaha
Nearly spat water all over my phone when you shouted Corbin! 😂😂
me shouting "YOURE SUPPOSED TO WATCH THE WHOLE SHOW DYLAN" at my screen whenever he gets disappointed by something 😭😭💀💀
16:45 the joke works you just havent watched the whole show :)
Dylan needs to do this for One Tree Hill!!!
idk why people liked it so much... the show was absolute garbage
Dew it
It's because that was the ending of "Hannah Montana 4 Ever". I think there were thirteen extra episodes about miley living life exposed as hannah, but really, the last episode was when she took off the wig, they were prepared to end it, it really had good closure, but I guess kids wanted more and that didn't work?
He should watch pair of kings it’s soooo funny bruh ☠️
Best show in the world sorry
I miss you so much
I feel like as kids it was more emotional cuz we watched all of it and it was ending, but looking back im like, she should have done the movie 😭 and they should have prolonged the Hannah Miley reveal for the last or second to last episode
Every time you transition into a sponsor I have to take a deep breath. Take from that what you will. 🙂
I plan to wear my nose ring until I die. Mines real though….
I haven't seen this show since it ended but I do remember loving it and being moved emotionally by it. Not so much by the season finale but the later episodes when Miley decided to hang up being Hannah. That plot was interesting. Then, some of the jokes you'd have to had seen in earlier seasons to appreciate them or get the relationship dynamics. For example the relationship Miley and her dad or with Jackson and Rico. Then we had the seasons with Jesse and Jake, etc. Overall, the show wasn't perfect but watching it as a kid it was pretty entertaining.
Lily’s alter ego used to be *Lola Lufnagle* and idk why Disney changed it to *Lola Lafonda* but that’s not what she said originally.   This is the first I’ve seen of that, but that’s why it’s got ADR (voice over) on it.   Wonder why they changed it?
oooo tssssss 😂😂
well it wasn’t cringey when i was 8
i watched the whole series as a kid and you weren’t missing much except the Dolly Parton episodes lol but by the final season, Miley Cyrus was basically 18 and wanted to get tf OUTTA there so she was phoning in the last season to fulfill the contract
I forgot at least half of the jokes from those episodes 🙈 Gotta love Dylan being done with the humour in this 😆  I've been a huge Hannah Montana fan and I still love it whenever I watch it, but I started watching when I was 12 and I'm not that sure I'd like it as much if I would have watched it now. It's mostly about the nostalgia at this point 😅 But it made me a Miley Cyrus fan which is what I'm especially thankful for 😄
Dylan you're thinking from an adult POV, imagine seeing this as a 15-18 yr old it's def more relatable, because we don't have that foresight that we have as adults , and because of lack of experience and all
you should watch hannah montana the movie
I shamelessly rewatched Hannah Montana when I was in my late 20s. It's so over the top but it is hilarious. It gets a bit stale in the last season, it was definitely time to end it at that point.
Tbh when I was little I wasn’t allowed to watch this show and when I tried to see what the fuss was about when I was older (like 15-16) I had kind of a similar reaction to Dylan but I think I’d just outgrown the humor by that point
As someone who was literally in a Hannah Montana fan club as a child… i know it’s cringe… I think one of the biggest appeals to the show was growing up with it and getting to know the characters as they grew up while they were about 5 years older than I am. Something about a lighthearted show was nice to relax and watch after school
i am so excited for this
I mean of course if you watch it as an adult for the first time you'll hate it, but those of us who were OG fans still love it 😅
Omg do modern family plsssss
the point is that her rambling joke was supposed to be long lol. they were shorter earlier in the show then they continued to get longer
It's charedgared
she still gets all the perks of being a celebrity when she’s hannah 😂😂 she just likes the ability to go back to being “normal” and not always in the public eye and people only wanting to use her for things
Teach me how you screenrecord for these commentary’s pls
pleaseeee react to wizards of waverly place
“You’re getting scammed you’re stupid enough to get scammed” a little ironic coming from you Dylan
WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLAAAACE
You look 40
dylan is a more talkative version of MGK to me 👀😂😂 also 2:25👌
Of course you don't see the appeal, you missed the tussle between Jake and Jesse 😂😂😂😂 The whole show has some great songs and I deffo cried when the last ep first aired cause it aired on my last day of primary school. It really felt like the end of an era in my life and theirs 😂😂
Oliver being Dylan just makes so much sense

"if I was Hannah Montana I'd be like, 'hey bitches i'm Hannah Montana'" - dylan 2022
The fact that he didn't hear cheese jerky is the worst part
Yeah I remember watching Hannah Montana I liked it when it came out I took me awhile to watch last season cause I stopped watching show forgot why than finally watched it was one of fave show when young not top 5 or 10 but I liked it
Please react to Wizards of Waverley place its one of my faves I would love to see your reaction when you have time Dylan can't wait
The oOououOuou yhEa are the best
I feel like I was meant to see this cause I just started rewatching Hannah Montana for the first time since I was 9
There’s so much that goes on in between lol
Of all Disney Channel shows, Good luck Charlie has the best comedy
Dylan I feel like you'd connect with the humour of "WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE" more lolllllll
Drake and Josh next!
I definitely can’t stand re watching the first season of any childhood show but I definitely enjoy the other seasons. Usually in even good shows the acting in the first season is absolutely terrible but as they get comfortable with each other it just flows better
dylan: *struggling to swallow and speak*  also dylan: *makes a “that’s what she said” joke anyways*
Dylan is that a new shirt?
Dylan this is why we say it's our "childhood" not adulthood LMAOOO
The jake and Jesse drama was the best part
I have a crush on Dylan i can't 😭
im the guy on the laugh track
PLEASE REACT TO MODERN FAMILY
I think you should do Zoey101 next  That show was great
I love this, but now I can’t rest until he’s done all the Disney iconic shows like wizards of waverly place and suite life
Lol yea one girl learned the lesson that finale was smh
Hannah Montana was the childhood show i grew up on I loved it when I was younger and now that I watch it when I am an adult I really really hate this show it is so cringy i couldn't even get a good laugh out of it and I love comedy because I love laughing it feels good to laugh but this show was trying too hard and it's sad 10 year old me would slap me if I said this but i don't care lol any show that i watched when i was a kid is super cringy or is really stupid and makes me hate myself for watching it
I enjoyed this commentary. But i still love Hannah Montana. I got emotional at the ending haha, but i gues that is because i have seen the whole show and that was a pretty big moment for the two of them. + yes, its very nostalgic as well. This is one of those shows i will love forever.
I didn’t even watch the last episodes. The show got so bad the last season
20:07 THESE CHAINS? TREE DOLLA OMG PLEASE TELL ME SOMEONE GOT THE REFERENCE HE MADE WITHOUT KNOWING
Haha love how Dylan is watching Hanna Montana and is more focused on the audience laughter than the show
thats why wizards of waverly place is the best disney show
noo you need to watch the movie!!! it's iconic
only watching the first and the last of something is a terrible way to do it if you actually want to like something
You missed out, should have watched the episode where she gets hit by lightning and thought her legs turned into a table 😆
See now i need suite life of zack and cody sorry
Dylan you got to watch the Hannah Montana movie now!
3:57 so violent.....so hot
Not missing a chance to point out scam colleges again😂
Almost sacrificing yourself to say “that’s what she said” you are a true comedian dylan😂
please react to hannah montana the movie
I'm honestly impressed with how many things about the show you glean from watching just the first and last eps. You are so on point sometimes. And honestly, I think the first couple of seasons of Hannah Montana were the best. I don't even think I watched the fourth season cause by that point I'd out grown it, but watching this episode with you it really doesn't feel the same as the earlier seasons. That's not to say the show was /good/, but there was a charm to it in seasons 1 and 2, and some of the plot lines were really innovative. Also Oliver gets better ok jhfgdk I loved him haha
Dylan says “ Get honey “ Daddy Dylan says “Do it”
Wizards of Waverly Place next pls!!!
Dylan, I’m 30 too, hmu 😉
Literally going through the worst period of my life and Dylan can still make me laugh and smile!
"theres a way to save yourselves some money and thats with honey”  our rap king 😭😭
dylan should do a shein review
I never got into this show but granted it premiered when I was already 18.  Watching you watch this makes me kind of glad I never did… acting felt very flat and the ending wouldn’t have been a good pay off in my opinion.  But I digress, as usual great commentary and perfect ad placement 👌🏼
I loved Hannah Montana so much, I watched it all the time. Watching it now I feel a mix of cringe and nostalgia...it was definitely better when I was like 7... I remember we had the first season on DVD and I know like all the lines still, but I saw it in Swedish tho. I think the best episodes are more in the middle, YOU SHOULD'VE WATCHED ONE EPISODE FROM EACH SEASON! The last season sucks and the last episode is so anticlimactic...it should've ended after season 3. The movie was incredible though. Jackson was hilarious and the only one with good jokes, but only real ones knows that Roxy is the goat. Dylan will never know...
Dead mom?!! YES!
You are such a cringe 30 year old that it’s inspiring.   Much love from a cringy 34 year old.
Lol I remembered the ketchup joke from the first episode but didn’t remember a single thing from the last episode besides the song.   PS look at that straight up toddler sitting across from Corbin in the 1st episode. Thats hilarious
I always thought that wizards of waverly place was the superior disney show
I’ve never seen the finale before, but it seems like they just ripped off the Friends finale…I feel like they should have gone even further with it and have Miley say “I got off the plane” haha
I think you would like Veronica Mars, Dylan 😊
When Miley had to reveal her secret and I’ll Always Remember You while she has flashback moments in the closet plays I still cry😭😭😭😭😭
I would pay so much money to see Dylan do a "first and last" for Buffy The Vampire Slayer. I feel like it'd become his favourite video ever.
The thing with Hannah Montana, is you have to watch the whole series to fall in love with the characters and to get the fourth season (which was a little more emotional than the first 3, even changing the name to Hannah Montana Forever) Also you had to have grown up with it
Dylan’s comment on that one guy in the audience made me choke on my Pringle,I was laughing that hard 😭😭
i hope he reacts the the movie one day that would be hilarious lmfaooo
I love watching Dylan scrambling for his nose ring 😂
Loved this show but the ending sucked and miley had far too many lovers
You can’t really appreciate this show unless you’ve actually seen the whole thing. Just watching the first two episodes in the last two episodes isn’t going to do it, and it’s a little unfair of you to mock the jokes when you don’t understand the whole show set up and how the jokes work. Just saying.
The way the show ended, with the girls almost learning a valuable lesson and then taking it all back in the last two minutes of the episode, was the theme in all of the later episodes. I really liked Hannah Montana for the first couple seasons but eventually stopped watching for this reason
i feel like some of the best episodes on disney shows happen mid way through. like the jake/jesse/miley love triangle was so great but the beginning and end was just ehh
“AHHHHHHHH Corbin” 😂😂😂😂
Oh I hated this show when I was a kid, never understood the appeal of  it. I would always change the channel whenever I saw it on, the jokes were very unfunny to me and the plots were silly so I never got into it.
Ok I’m not the type to comment on YouTube or defend HM of all things, but this show had certain episodes that SLAPPPPED lol the hype had subtle weight behind it. Alright I’m out.
and thats why wizards of waverly place is better
You should watch the movie. Its a better take at the life of keeping Hannahs identity a secret but still having he struggle of keeping up with both Hannah and Miley plus the usual friend and romantic drama.
I can't believe the guy that played Jackson was 28 when the show started. I even double checked and Dylan was right. WOW😲... that's kind of weird. 🤨
For Jackson who can’t do any job… in uh some serie on disney, like years later he appears as a manager and he tells a girl he can change her identity and no one will know that, and that his sister had that too….. THAT was the best of Jackson. Him returning somewhere undercover just talking about this😂
Oh my god it’s happening!😃😃
And now I’m subscribed cause he said “That’s what she said”
I NEED this for The Suite Life on Deck
Dylan can you do a video watching the maze runner movies!!
React to wizards of waverly place
you gotta watch it when you're little or it'll never make sense obviously.
I hate this show
at least he admitted to being a narcissist
do arcane...you might actually like it
The way he slides in the ads is always so smooth 💀
i think one thing that makes hm still classic is the songs and episodes actually have some good messages
It's officially Hannah Montana week huh? best time to be a Dylan, Trin and Hannah fan
'it doesn't feel impactful' me as a 7 yo child : *bawling my eyes for days*
This series is so nostalgic for me I was like 'what is he talking about this is hilarious' the whole video 😳
not you spoiling 5 feet apart lol
This was one of the best Disney shows you did show me a lot I missed when I was a child but the nostalgia will be there
Disney really was promoting college education propaganda. Miley was literally a millionaire who already had an established career not only in the story on the show but also in real life. Disney really wanted children to know the only way to succeed is by going to college LMaooo
Ok, now try wizards of waverly place. Alex russo is a complete mood. Wizards to me was always better bc the characters were more fleshed out
As far as Disney shows go i'd say this one holds up the least. So cringe and dumb lol But the music is bangin, and it was still my whole childhood
I'm not really sure if he already tryed it out before, but I think a reaction to the first and last episode of "Henry Danger" would also be funny and nice to watch (:
This show has its moments and the songs were good
disney player on pc is trash
21:26 R.I.P headphone users lol
Dylan not missing the college scam mention , it’s become vital in every video really😂😭
Definitely should’ve watched the true ending in everyone’s heart of the show where she reveals herself or the movie.
Trin this you?
Just finished crying for 13-15 minutes... Good thing i held off of watching this first cause i need this right now. Thanks dylan
Dylan, this isn’t a spinoff of the remake of Scarface with Al Pacino, it’s a spinoff of the original 1938 film with Paul Muni. Please do your research just a little bit more before jumping into these things and making these claims!
That was such weird episode. I loved Hannah Montana as a kid and the songs, and I actually liked the movie but I actually thought the show ended when Miley revealed herself as Hannah Montana. This was so awkward to watch lol
Do you guys think Dylan got scammed at college?
I still love this show so much!
Ahh I literally downloaded honey two days ago. Wish this went up before!
<3
The show never hit as hard as the movie in my opinion :/
You and welchy should do a collab
You should watch The House Bunny
The movie was better
WARNING: This comment may resemble a rant, but I have strong feelings about this: The ending of Hannah Montana has always annoyed me. Miley goes to Paris to do this movie thing, and I'm no actor, but I do believe there are some contracts involved. Like, if she was already on location, it meant that they were ready to start filming, so you can't "just" leave. It doesn't matter how famous you are or how much you miss home or whatever, that's just disrespectful and, frankly, unacceptable behavior. It's bound to have some consequences - especially when it's her first movie. On top of that it seems that the college has a very vague and confusing admissions process. And that frustrates me a lot because I don't think it is alright to take education so lightly. I'm not American, so maybe I've missed the whole meaning of "college" completely, but I'm under the impression that it is a school before all else. In addition to all of this, it's very immature to not accept that your best friend might go in a different direction than you. Y'all can still be friends. Like daamm, girls. You have phones. It might actually be easier to make new friends íf you don't know anyone. The whole last episode is just idiotic to me. Sorry, Disney...
I remember watching the first episode on the phone with my best friend in 4th grade 🥹 we were obsessed. she passed away 3 years ago but every time I see the show I always think of her haha
the jake drama of miley comparing his life to her life was probably my favorite part of the series
This makes me scared if I ever rewatch That's so Raven, that was my #1 and I don't want my memories ruined 😭
For me, the 2nd season has to be the best.  I mean in the 1st one they were still finding their footing and introducing all the characters but in the 2nd they had more time for more creative plotlines. In the 3rd it became more ab mileys boyfriends and lily/oliver drama and the 4th was kinda set to be the final one so it lost some impact.
I thought you're 39
Should’ve watched Wizards of Waverley Place instead.. that’s so much better and it’s actually funny
Dylan: "This is a sequel to Scarface"  Me: Yeah, that checks out
i really cant imagine how is watching this without all the nostalgia
Everyone in the show: “ AWW🥺🫶🏻” Dyl: “ NHAGHH🤠”
i actually rewatched the whole series while i was in iso with covid earlier this year and it definitely didn’t feel the same as it did watching it when i was 14 but still had the nostalgic feeling too. i grew up with hannah montana, any chance i got i’d be watching disney so its bound to bring back some memories, although feel you’d feel different about Miley and Lilys goodbye if you watched the whole series :) but 100% they should’ve ended it when Miley revealed she was Hannah Montana. :)
It hit different when you watched it when you were younger
The way Dylan's opinion has zero impact on me for the first time cause Hannah Montana is everything
Dylan mentioning his scam college made me go "Eyyyyyyyyyy (☞ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞"
loooooool yes, Dylan ruined my memories of Hanna Montana 🤡 I honestly remembered it totally different, however I still love the movie THAT WAS SO GOOD
Okay with shows like this it's the inbetween that hits, the climb.  (End up missing the journey coz I'm pretty certain th pilot was shite.)  Update: indeed twas shite. Buuutt there is another great -similar- old show where all the jokes hit .   (Hint boy best friend has an odd name)
Umbrella Academy…. just putting it out there
Hannah Montana, I would say didn’t age well. Hannah Montana was def my favorite show as a kid and when Disney+ first came out, it was the show I was most excited to be able to binge, aside from like, that’s so raven of course. But to my surprise, it was really hard to keep up with lol. As a kid, Hannah was favorite but now I’d say now I’d prob pick wizards (again, aside from queen raven).
You know a great Disney show with solid humor? That's so Raven and also the Suite life. But not the cruise ship arc.
You should watch the movie)
oh my god. lilly is the girl from cyber bully and the brunette girlfriend is jenna marshall from pll i-
i wonder how many people know that he means the "college is a scam" literally.
U have to watch the whole show to be honest. The last two Episodes were rushed, because the show was cancelled. The whole 4th Season on the other hand is kinda amazing. It's for children, but i still can watch it and have a good time. It's not as good as i remember it when i watched it when i was younger, but still very enjoyable.
Hannah Montana was my childhood, I remember fighting a kid on my school because she had a HM t-shirt and I really thought I was the only one who knew Miley was Hannah 😭  Also when she reveals she's Miley in the show it's so emotional!!!! So much nostalgia
am waiting for you to upload aaahhhh finally.. it feels like a months
imo i think wowp is one of the best disney shows especially comedy wise
I don’t know what it is, but I feel like everyone is feeling nostalgic and watching Disney related stuff… my YouTube history is currently full of HSM 😅
I grew up when this show was on, everyone in my class was watching it but i was too busy watching teen titans and samurai jake 😂, i friend of mine tried to show me an episode but I never got why everyone was obsessed with it, same thing with twilight.
DYLAN WILL ALWAYS BE MY HAPPY PILL.
The first episode I was laughing a lot and the last couple were so beyond boring and they didn’t get any better at the writing or acting lol. I’m the same age as Miley so I loved the show when it first came out but I felt too old to watch it after a couple years and stopped. I was obsessed with the first season when It came out.
Oh Dylan... you missed ALL of the Jake mess lol
I continue to feel dread whenever my honey sponsor tingle acts up
Dylan's scream should be my ringtone, it gets me everytime lmfao
tbh i know nothing about hannah montana, but when i was a kid i had these snowboots with her face on them
I think you should give this show a change watch more episodes because this is a amazing show
You ruined it for me Dylan 😭 I had fond memories of it…. Bc I watched it when I was 8 years old 💀 now rewatching it with you…..it’s not that great. Still love it tho lol
Hannah Montana. The birth of a legendary career
Dylan should react to violetta
Watch wizards of waverly placeee🥹
Dylan: I have the mind of a child Dylan: why has no one killed each other yet
20:06
i'd say great minds think alike but its more fun to say you copied trin so COPY CAT
I watched this show again a few months ago and there were some great episodes but the ones you watched are actually some of the not so good episodes. So maybe you should give it another chance.
10:32 ... lol
Dylan where is your stranger things season 3 reaction - I’m waiting 😂😂
you should do wizards of waverly place 😋
The way the them find out Miley is Hannah by her feet would have definitely happen if Dan Schneider made this show
Omg dylan your ad transitions are out of the worldd good lordd🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂
I remember liking wizards better. After watching this I am sure wizards was better
it's embarrassing how much I used to love this shit. though I don't think I ever finished the show
Yayy! I've been waiting for a new vid
Hannah Montana the movie has good commentary potential
Dylan I bet you wouldn't even know who to choose...Jake or Jesse
I am disappointed that you didn't make a Scarface joke the second you heard about the dead mom.
Dylan stop ruininnnggg ittttttt
The stylist guy seems like he knows about pedowood or what goes on in hollyweird
1:36 dylan take off your nose ring~
I remember that as a kid I hated this show with passion. Sometimes Disney had a whole day of just streaming Hannah Montana and my mom would have to break the bad news to me, because I just despised it so much. Coming back to it as an adult, all I can say is that I had taste even as a child.
Friday night lights next!!!
I wonder what Dylan would've thought if they kept the alternate ending where it was Miley as a little girl imagining the whole series. They filmed that ending and the one you see now at the same time but decided on this one.
When I saw the title I thought you were gonna watch the movie
The show ending isn't as impactful as the episode where she finally lets the secret go, and I consider that to be the real ending
Dylan sees himself in Oliver 💙
Missed you Dylan , XD
that honey segway tho
I'm so glad I didn't watch it back then!
…..I thought he was watching the movie….
Best scene was the concert which she explained her id
Why do I feel like Wizards of Waverly Place would be more up Dylan's alley....
Me: a UC Berkeley student watching this. Dylan: catching that they're going to "Standford" not "Stanford" Me: Oh, cool. Interesting. The show: showing UC Berkeley's campus instead of Stanford. Me: :| :/ Fiiiiiiine, I guess that makes sense.
I was never a Hannah Montana fan even growing up. But i was obsessed with Wizards of Waverly Place, I really hope Dylan does this again with Wizards!!!!!
💕
the last season is the worst. should have watched the 2nd season.
In spanish is way better lol
Please react to the Disney movie 16 wishes!!
i actually cant be objective about this, this was every single day of my childhood and i psychologically cant make myself see it as anything but quality tv
jackson & rico CARRIED this show
DYLAN I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS THANK U
I thought u we’re watching the movie u bum
Hmmm get payed a lot and work on a movie oooorrrr go into student debt and depression for school… school it is!
Can you please watch ecanto!!!! Because i loveeeee your video's and i lovvvveee that movie! 🥰
I despise the ending and pretend it didn't happen honestly. Miley has her dream, her future, and she can go to college whenever. A good film isn't just gonna come around again. It was her dream so why couldn't she go after it?
I grew up with this show and when I watched it when I was young I was like eh ok but then I watched it a couple months ago and bawled my eyes out on the last episode 😭
I will always remember you episode is where she comes out as miley and for me that was the real ending of the show. its touching and beautiful made. you should’ve have watched this one and then the finale
So because I have no life (lol), let me tell a (hopefully short story):  In my high school batch (I graduated a little over 10 years ago), I'm one of the few who not only left the suburb I grew up in but the whole region itself. I didn't even want to leave because almost everyone stayed there or at least in near enough places but I had to because LIFE happened to me. I was also the only one who went to the university I went to and was the only one who took up an Engineering course so watching the ending again now with the lens of an adult; I agree with you Dylan. I get Disney wanted a feel-good show but Phil of the Future didn't have a sugary sweet ending either so why couldn't HM? It would have probably helped me a lot more if I saw on media that it isn't that bad going your different ways.   But I'll always love the show since it takes me back to times in my life where I had less on my mind. Yes. Even it isn't standing the test of time well for me. Lol
Non- Recommendation: You should do girl meets world
Season 1 and 2 I think are the iconic episodes of Hannah Montana that everyone remembers. When they switch locations tot that new house and the last season is so far removed. Absolute trash and I’m sorry your eyes had to see it but it’s not the Real Hannah Montana moments. I’d recommend season 2
Hannah Montana is honestly just a product of its time and it made Miley the biggest star at the time which happened through the show. The filming and gags are the same in other Disney shows so it wasn’t hard for most people to get into it, I remember back then finding it funny but honestly I always knew The Suite Life on Deck and Wizards of Waverly Place were better. But Hannah Montana came before it and it has a lot of songs which engages the audience.
I was waiting for the audible sponsor but you juxed me dylllllaannnnn. I love your videos so much
Dylan: *Hoped and expected to enjoy it* Also Dylan: *Only watched the pilot and finale episodes*
I know you don’t do recommendations buuuuut try Icelandic water
Have you watched "Wizard of Weaverly Place"??
Trin Lovell just released her commentary as well! I really hope they collaborate! I live for his videos!!
I remember loving this because I was 13 when it first came out so I felt like I was actually going through it. It’s so different watching it for the first time as an adult than a teen/kid
damn i'm surprised at how much i remember from the scenes showed in this vid. i watched way more HM than i thought i did lol
Lmao Dylan's Corbin Bleau jumpscare
The best character was definitely Roxie, and it's tragic that she just disappeared
dylan the nose ring is one thing but shopping at “Always22” 😭 PLZ LMAO
As much as I want to hate the film because I realize that it’s objectively kind of awful, I can’t because it was the last movie I watched with some really old friends of mine before they moved really far away. I have a lot of positive association with it. Edit: I wrote this comment before I even watched the video, I didn’t know it was first and last. I haven’t even seen the damn show.
😂 to be fair, the last season of Hanna Montana sucked so bad, it was the worst
I recently binged Hannah Montana as a 21 yo. I knew it was cringe but it was funny, endearing, cute cringe. But yeah some of the jokes, especially in seasons 2 and 3 actually made me laugh. The nostalgia is basically what makes it so adorable
I do agree, College can be a scam. But with a bachelors degree or masters degree you can get amazing job opportunities with higher pay, so you don’t have to live like Jackson from Hannah Montana 😂
Interesting. I only watched the first 2 seasons I think as a kid. But after seeing your reaction, I think BOTH Miley and Rachel from Friends should have gone to Paris! Neither Lily nor Ross were worth it.
That joke from Five Feet Apart commentary tho😂😂
Do wizards of Waverley place next!
now watch the Hannah Montana movie
Dylan's kids will rebel by going to college
Dylan I just recently watched ur until dawn and detroit become human series and literally I would be SO DOWN if u did something like that again, they're so fun to watch and I feel like they'd be fun to play on ur end. U should def have a comeback w those types of vids!
Is it just me or is Jackson’s girlfriend Miss Jenna “I can smell a bitch a mile away” from Pretty Little Liars?
how bout watch Jonas L.A
I never really liked hannah Montana that much. Wizards of Waverly place was my favorite
I think wizards of waverly place is more your vibe
Dylan let’s be real, you aren’t too old for a nose ring. You are too old for a fake nose ring
i love the idea of doing all the old iconic disney shows and bringing in all the nostalgia and laughs. it's such a good time
Pause at 2:40 and thank me later🤣
Wizards of Waverly Place has aged so much better imo
Keep the fame, I’d be satisfied with just the fortune.
PLZZ react to 18 again drama first 2 episodes korean drama ...you are gonna love it❤️❤️❤️❤️
Hannah Montana will always be iconic, and I feel sorry for the people who didn’t grow up with this show 😭 especially the movie bruh, STRAIGHT ICONIC!!!!
As someone who Never watched the show that best friend is so flipping toxic
Please do a first and last ep of degrassi the next generation
The title: “Tries” Me: does he not finish it? 🥲
17:39 you.. you really wanna bring up fake schools?.. 😂
watch sonny with a chance next PLEASEEEE
Every segue to an ad read from Dylan, I can always see it coming but I still automatically say “f*ck you” like a ritual
You have to watch Step up 2 the streets
I watch the ad read just for the great setups
i love dylan and trin going through their hannah montana era at the same time
Dylan reacting to the finale of a show he’s watched four episodes of: there’s something about this that doesn’t feel impactful   Then again I didn’t have cable and watched the same first two seasons on channel 4 abc family on weekends and didn’t actually watch the whole thing so I’m actually in the same boat tbh
I used to be a video game tester. It's actually a decent job, but it's minimum wage until you become a Lead QA Manager or something of the like. And you only work project to project - it's a contract job.
ima need you to watch that's so raven, zac and cody, and wizards
I remember when this first came out and the next day I saw some 6 year olds trying to reenact the same lunch scene with the mean girls lol
I feel like the ending episode is very unsatisfactory I feel like if it skipped to like a year later it would be more reasonable like “oh she made the movie and now she can go to college for a few years”
Ok but you missed the episode where they destroyed the space time continuum and Jackson’s butt disappeared.
I wanted to laugh at the scarface jokes but it wasn't it 😔
You’ve ruined it for me, but in a good way 😂
Never watched the show, and I honestly am glad I didn't 🤣 Its just not my thing
I grow up watching Hannah Montana and it was my favorite show mostly because of the relationship between her brother and father. 😂 Watching it now feels cringy, but I’ve always got the memories of how watching it back then felt like. Sitcoms usually focus on the characters, the more you watch , the more you laugh at their silliest jokes.  15 years later.. I still listen to her songs.
Dylan's videos are the only videos were I enjoy getting to the sponsorship. His transitions get me every time
In the adult world, a tushie tear means no anal for 6-9 months.
Sadly I'm named after this cursed show
The best characters werent even in those episodes, honestly the first few episodes and like basically the last season are the worst bits
U RUINED IT FOR  MEEEEE but its all so tru 😂😂
Hi Dylan, could you make a reaction of Rush Hour? I bet you gonna like it :))
Do wizard of waverly place!!!
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE FOR SO LONG AHHHHH
I was obsessive over Hannah Montana from age 7-11 but I refused to watch the last season. I can’t rewatch it now as an adult- the Disney shows I can rewatch now as an adult and still love just as much are Wizards of Waverly Place and Good Luck Charlie
okay but i was always a more wizards of waverly place girl, how bout yall
i can't believe that as a kid i was such a fan of this, it sucks so bad lmao
Bro you HAVE to do first and last episode of lost
You might like wizards or suite life on deck a bit better
Watch wizards of waverly place!!
Honestly the last good Disney Channel show was That's So Raven. After that all the others shows didn't grab my attention and I outgrew Disney Channel shows. I'm glad I grew up watching Lizzie Mcguire and That's So Raven because the Disney Channel nowadays  kind of sucks.
The way this finale was wiped clean from my mind. Didn’t remember a single thing about it 😂
2:42 all a part of her plan 😂
0:20 i can’t 😂
I loved the show when I was younger but now it’s really cringey :( other shows like wizards osos waverly place for example, to this day I still enjoy them😅
It's not a Dylan is in Trouble video if he's not mentioning how much of a scam college is.
I remember the last eps being way more intense 😂😂😂😂
The most unrealistic part of the whole college thing is that they would ever be able to get out of their housing agreement, especially after moving in, or getting their money back like it was no big deal if they did manage to move. You secure a spot in dorms almost a year in advance. And that room definitely required special permissions. No way you're getting out of that.
Dylan: I wish she got caught by the feet, I kinda like the feet thing Me: lol this isn't nick
I waited soooo long for thisss
next Disney show u should watch is that's so raven lest see how u would like that one u could start doing a first and last with Disney shows
Dylan PLEASE do a reaction to RAGS it’s a movie 🎥 from Nickelodeon I need to see and hear ur commentary personally an underrated masterpiece
Eh.
Dylan, this is one of those shows where it started rough, then really found it’s voice in the middle and that’s where all the nostalgia is, and then lost it by the end. So you saw the worst parts of the show.
Anything with an unironic laugh track makes me want to bulge my eyes out.
With the kissing thing, Disney channel had a period of time where they weren’t allowed to show characters kissing on any show
Season 2 and 3 is gold !
The last few episodes of Hannah Montana are honestly skip-able. Really most of the last season has a different tone then the rest of the show that it is skip-able. But when I have gone back an re-watched I stopped once she revelled herself as Hannah.
wizards of waverly place is a disney show that actually holds up quite well compared to hannah Montana haha
watch gilmore girls
I remember loving this show as a kid and now seeing it at 21…. It’s something else lol btw I love you Dylan and all your videos! On here and ooga booga
Ya know. I think my greatest fear is writing a tv show and then getting a notification that Dylan has made a video on it. The fear of how badly I am about to get roasted would send me into an early grave lol
why did I never realize they go to Standford and not Stanford?
i love how Dylan always catches me with his sponsorships lmao…. I always think I’m gonna see it coming & then… i never do 💀💀 -HTTV
I watched this in highschool for God knows why and cringed through it all😂
I hope Lilly scalped that first class ticket to Parris in the airport lobby for a fat stack of cash.
I must have really not liked the ending cuz I’m blocked it out I thought she really went off to do the movie and lily went to college
“that job pays like $4 an hour”  *me working for $4.13 an hour 🫠
this was my favorite show
Dylan trying  not to talk  about his nose ring like :    😞😞😞😞😞
This show was such a big part of my childhood and I remember absolutely none of it
Realized that Trin posted watching Hannah Montana just 3 days ago
You should react to pair of kings its good
sad because the long "said what" joke on the second to last episode was so iconic after watching her do shorter ones the whole season lmaooo  also why was the Hannah montana movie so elite-  Dylan would be blown away
I so wish Dylan had seen Jake, I want to see his reaction to all the things he does for Mikey and how self absorbed he is for the most of his screen time.
First Trin Lovell and now you? Coincidence? I think not
this was so. much. fun.  and hannah montana is genuinly funny, that era o disney was great in this sense
Video game tester- 73K a year. I'd do it if I liked video games lol
Alrighty, finished the video! And even though I did enjoy this show a lot as a kid, yeah, it's pretty much only enjoyable as a kid for the most part. I really liked their bodyguard character, she was over-the-top in a fun way, but sadly wasn't in any of these episodes lol. I really wish they had kept the ending where they go their separate ways and remain friends, because that's a WAYYY better message to send to kids rather than "You're not a good friend unless you sacrifice your dreams for them" kinda thing.
I thought the movies was supposed to be the end? But they ordered a last season after? Am I making that up?
I loved season 1 and 2, the jokes were good and the songs too but on season 3 I started to get bored of the show, the jokes weren't funny anymore at least for me
I swear Dylan and Trin are linked creatively
I was in the hospital while the finale was airing because I ate 14 corndogs
I feel like Dylan has some unresolved feelings about his college getting shutdown
i liked hannah montana, i watched it, but the music and probably the movie are what really made it all stick; i'd say the shows I actually still find funny today are that's so raven, suite life of zack and cody, and (big underrated one *i think*) sonny with a chance.
I’m glad I’m not the only who hates Disney’s video player
Dylan making fun of that one audience member and then laughing the exact same way when doing the ad transition is the unintentional humor I came for
This TV show was my absolute childhood, and I am THRILLED to see my favourite movie commentary youtuber roast it XDDDD
i’m convinced that every one of my bad/life’s decisions is a consequence of my childhood love for this show, so thank you for making this video dylan
I never knew i needed this so much
When are we getting the next HTTYD upload Dylan pleaseeee
My experience with the show is that my neighborhood friend growing up, his dad was a cameraman for Hannah Montana and my friend got to be an extra on the show a few times. He gave me a signed cast picture for my birthday, from Miley Cyrus that said “Hey Eibhlin, hope you have a great 11th. Love Miley.” It was pretty cool
Dylan you should watch the whole series! The audience connection with the show wasn't a four episode watch. What made Hannah Montana the show that it was/is was the development of the characters with the audience. I remember vividly how the finale episode made me feel and til this day its sad because I felt like I was with them through the ride. I would love a whole series react this this and other Disney shows lol
It is truly a cringe show lol nice video
The Hannah Montana movie is the best piece of the Hannah Montana cinematic universe and after they moved the show didn't hit the same
I used to enjoy this, but rewatching maka me think "was i that dumb?"
Seeing this and then rewatching the movie reminds me of how terrible the show was even though I was obsessed. Though the movie was still cringy it is so nostalgic. If only the show was the same quality lol
Dylan, watch the movie! You'll be pleased to hear that Oliver is barely in it.
Let’s face the fact: Dylan did this video because he knew he could bring up the collage scam.
The last season def didn’t hit as hard because they were in a different house and mileys passion for the show just wasn’t there anymore. The best episodes (or most emotional) were the where they moved and where she revealed herself to the world. However I think he would enjoy the movie because the quality it’s just *chefs kiss*
Please Watch wizards of waverly place
Now he needs to watch That’s So Raven!!!
lily yelling like that is very middle school tbh it fits
I bet 2007 Dylan was exactly like that Oliver dude in the first episode. With the Zack Efron haircut and the flashy blue shirt. And  14 year old me wouldve been totally into it
Honestly Jackson and Robby ray were the whole show. They’re so funny
Fun fact Hannah Montana was originally supposed to be Alexis Texas but that turned out to be a corn star so they changed it cuz they didn’t want kids looking up their favorite show and finding..🫠
I feel as if you should just make a series about watching all the Barbie movies.
Yeah there are certainly a lot of perks to being famous, but being famous as a kid and everybody knowing you is what messed up so many Disney stars...
I can’t believe how long this shows been on
Dylan obsessing over the laugh track was the highlight of his entire career
i love how trin just did a commentary on hannah montana and now i have this, we love hannah montana in this household i guess
As someone who watched it when it aired, I feel like the last season was not meant to be. It feels like the show ended when they sold the house or around when the movie happened (yes there's a movie). But then executive thought it would be good to go and release more content because it was still selling well.   Not only do the jokes get old by that point they also seem to be trying to cram in last effort to rap up old story lines left and right. They gave the brother a job and girlfriend they even made him have his own place, they gave the dad a new wife and they went and made Miley reveal her secret (not during the finale), they even brought back old recurring characters in that final season.   I'm not saying the show was any good by any means but most of the show before they sold the house felt like the first 2 episodes and the last season felt like a okay we want to go now.
Dylan needs to watch the cinematic masterpiece that is Hannah Montana the movie
I wonder why you don't connect to the final episode emotionally 🤔🤔  Maybe it's because you've known the characters for under an hour lol. It's not like the episodes are that great, but it's the fact that we've seen these characters grow up over 4 seasons that makes this emotional.  Gotta say, I did get emotional when I watched this. It was during a harder time in my teen years and this show really helped me then. It's really a guilty pleasure show.  I wouldn't watch it again now though, I'm simply too old.
This is great. I was actually kind of vaguely curious how the show ended. But I didn't feel like watching it. Now I don't have to.  Closure. Dylan style.
I need to see you watch the first and final episode of Wizards of Waverly Place because THAT is a JUMP!
Now you gotta watch the movie
even when i was a kid hm was not my favorite show on dc. i enjoyed it for the musical aspect but i didn’t find it very funny. i think you’d enjoy watching something like suite life of zack and cody and/or wizards of waverly place a lot more!!
This is one of the most entertaining, funny videos I’ve watched in a while. Thank you!
Hanna Montana is a classic  Best the best Disney channel show is wizard of Waverley place Selena Gomez as alex is just a mood till today
4:48 If this had been a Nickelodeon show.
My brother is actually a video game tester and he makes decent money. Not personal assistant money but not bad.
Her friend Lilly is Haley Joel osment’s younger sister :) I remember her in spy kids first 😭 and Jason earles, jackson, was 30 I believe when this show first came out
I’m so sad Dylan is never going to see the cheese and jerky but between Jackson and Rico
Watch wizards of waverly place next
"DEAD MOM? YASSSS" - Dylan, 2022
2:23 I lost it ahahahhahaah
trin and dylan releasing hannah montana videos in the same week is so iconic
Me watching Hannah Montana at age 7 thinking she was 19 👀🤣 I am super shocked to discover that she was in middle school 😅🤣 Wow 😮
This is the video I never knew I needed
i wouldn't wanna be famous in middle school bc then every single day everyone's gonna be watching you. imagine dealing with zits when everybody's paying attention to every detail about you. plus she'd know that all the admiration was superficial if she went from unpopular loser to everybody loving her.
I honestly didn't know how much I needed to hear Dylan say "I wanted to be a part of the Hannah Montana community" 💀😂
I didn’t like the show but I love the movie idk why
When I was a kid Hannah Montana was the shit but watching it in adulthood it’s so bad and cringey
Im surprised he didn't mention how awful her wig was in the pilot episode
Did Dylan just admit he is a Narcissist?
GREAT SEGWAY TO THE HONEY AD OMG 😂😂
Wait wtf does Miley need to go to college for anyways. I’m sure she makes millions as Hannah, whatever she majors in she won’t have time for anyways bc she’s literally a celebrity
You should also try Wizards of Waverly Place. I love that series and I wanna see you destroy it. 🤣
I love how he kept laughing at the singing transitions
You definitely need to do this with Wizards of Waverly Place and both Suite Life shows, I've always wondered if they aged well too tbh
Hannah with her black chewing gum = Dylan and his red wine stained mouth
“Why doesn’t Miley want people to know she’s Hannah Montana?” Bc she wants the best of both worlds….
24 year old watch 30 year old watched Hannah Montana for the first time
You Should have stopped at season 3, season 4 sucks absolute ass.
Thank you so much for pointing out why I hated this show as a child. I never watched it again and still had the kid logic of “ew show is bad”. Now I know why lol
hannah montana may be cringey but she has many bangers
I never got to follow the show consistently, but yeah as a kid, it was fine and fun. Super cringe now and the message was botched. Taught kids about toxic friendships and how they’re totally OK. Oh and rooting for main characters who bully the “mean” characters lol.
I grew up watching Hannah Montana so when watching it as an adult, there is definitely a sense of nostalgia. Watching it fresh as an adult, I can see why it doesn’t connect. Also to quote Raj from Big Bang Theory “get season 2. Season 1 was still finding itself”. Seasons 3 & 4 are my favourite because the music gets better imo.
i’ve been looking forward to this for so long HAHSHD
do wizards of waverly place
I see the ending as being a good friend. This friend has been with her through thick and thin.  They promised they would do it. Miley broke that promise. Besides, just because she didn't take that movie doesn't mean she gave up acting.
I'm not sure if you saw this Dylan, but I just found something that would amuse you to the highest level and make a great video. Noah Beck, (one of our FAVOURITE tiktokers) will be starring in a movie. Based off of a Wattpad book called the Quater Back and I or something. If you see this, this would entertain me to the highest level and would love a video about this. Love your personality, and late nights with Dylan.
This video is a cultural reset
This is NOT a recommendation, I am JUST saying that the first and last episodes of Wizards of Waverly Place were really good
I wonder if he will watch Hannah Montana, the movie 🤔
I literally teared up when I went through some of the Hannah Montana songs the other day
This video is so funny 😂😂😂
“i hate em he reminds me of me 🤮” hilarious bc Oliver’s actually the best character
Dude the middle seasons of this show hold up so well IMO. When they moved houses and upped the production quality, the quality of the content took a huge dip but I unironically watch episodes from seasons 2/3 and later in season 1 all the time bc it was genuinely funny
I don’t remember the show being this bad as a kid, but that’s probably because I was a kid lol.
I still rewatch the show, but after so many years I realize how much the jokes are dated, but it's nostalgic ya know. Also the Jake Ryan plot was the main reason I watched and rewatched. Wizards of Waverly Place tho is something u should watch bc it definitely was the better show for me.
After rewatching Hannah Montana I came to a conclusion.    The songs still slap
I am apart of the Hannah Montana fandom but then again I’m 13 turning 14 in like 3 days sooooo do with that
Is that a new shirt i’m seeing?
i was 11 when this came out and even though i still watched it (cause i was a disney channel junkie) it was never my favorite show. the humor didnt hit for me and sometimes i found it too much. when wizards came out, i found it much more entertaining and stopped watching hannah montana.
zoey 101 first and last i need it
Still miss music reactions
Hannah Montana was the first "big kid" show I got to watch so I absolutely loved it. But even back then I didn't like the last season very much, 1-3 though is my childhood lots of fond memories! Aaand the music is great. Loved this video Dylan, really made me happy!
This whole video is a fever dream
Could you PLEASE watch the first and last episode of That's So Raven?
I literally can't believe I watched this. I think I watched every episode as a kid.
gosh i didnt watch the last season of hannah montana. kinda happy about it
Waited a long time for a new video and you gave us Disney sugar coated pink fluff. Thanks but this got stopped 1:22 seconds in. What a massive waste of time. I could have more happily made a dentist appointment with that time.
I watched every episode when I was young and if I got in trouble at school I couldn’t watch the new episodes
I’ve always liked Hannah Montana, but I also always found it cringe. Wizards of Waverly Place was definitely my fav of all Disney’s series
I haven’t seen these episode as an adult it’s so cringey now lol 😂  I would love to see you do wizards of wa early place next. If you haven’t alreSy seen it
The background music between scenes is so weird…
Dylan you should definitely watch killing eve its an amazing show. you will LOVE the murders in it.
Is no one going to mention the alternative ending to the show??? Where everything was just inside Miley Cyrus’ mind?? That honestly scarred me for life
you changed my whole opinion about this show  less than 30 mins when I watched this shows for years.
i know this will fall upon blind eyes but i would love to see you react to all of hannah montana LMAO
I liked Hannah Montana when it first came out cause I was only 6-7 years old. But after the movie came out I got bored with the plot. I never watched the Forever season so this was new for me lol.
Stoppppp I can’t believe this
Just saw Trin's vid on the Hannah Montana movie. This is a great indirect followup to watch.
Lily is kind of an awful friend if we're being honest. if I had a huge career opportunity and my friend basically gave me an ultimatum, that girl would be out of my life so fast. and I've had some real shit friends who hated me doing what was best for me.
Meh.. it's entertaining enough - you crack me up dude 😂
OH MY GOSH JACKSON'S GIRLFRIEND IS JENNA MARSHALL FROM PPL
Js you did the show might as well do the movie
I think it’s more of a progress thing that u have watch the whole show to enjoy the ending cuz I dead cried at the ending 💀
I feel like Emily demonstrated more genuine sadness when saying goodbye to miley
Even though I liked this show I HATED Lily lol she seemed so selfish I was always like chill your best friends with a pop star
tbh the episode where miley had to tell the whole world that she was hannah on jay leno was better than the actual season finale idk why they didn’t stop it there
Dylan being so salty about college 🤣🤣🤣❤
I didn’t know I needed Dylan conspiracy Hannah Montana theories until right now
i don’t remember watching hannah montana but i do remember watching dateline as a kid
Dylan needs to watch the Hannah Montana movie. the budget was much better and that holds the most nostalgia for me. I totally forgot how the show began and ended. I think I liked season 3 and 4 more and the whole plot with Jessie McCartney's character was a big moment even though she ended up with the other guy I loved that love triangle.  Lily and Oliver were also cute when first trying to date. But I was a much bigger fan of like Suite Life and Wizards of Waverly place! do first and last episodes of those next.
I love that Segway to honey!
the scenes between the dad and the sin js ghe best part
It’s so strange that you think it makes no impact but really this ending made me cry, I think it’s when you watch ALL 4 SEASONS and rly get attached then it makes it so much better and the show is so good, well ok it’s very ummm how do I say this very Disney good
I love the Hannah Montana content we’ve been getting, the movie with trin and the show with Dylan
"corbin green" 😭😭 also why did i forget corbin was in hannah until right now
I love how dylan and trin are bascially the same person
can you watch lab rats
Have you ever heard of Violetta?
I used to like that show. When I was a kid. I even dressed as her for Halloween one year. Mostly for the wig though lol. It's just a bit cringe now.
do wizards of waverly place!
i still cry at the last episode 🥲
Hannah Montana is the moment! The theme song has lived in my head rent free for what 10 years now lol
Dylan needs to watch Wizards of Waverly Place, that show holds up with the jokes fr
I never found this show funny I just liked the songs and the drama lol
when I was in middle school I remember I was looking for something to watch on the TV and I landed on Hannah Montana and she was talking to her horse and I remember thinking "alright" and changed the channel 💀
kids wake up dylanisintrouble posted
Emily The actress who plays lily is a very screamy actress lol everything she plays in is very over the top
Dude are you like mentally connected to miss Trin Lovell? Because she just made a Hanna Montana movie review.
You had to have watched it as a child to properly enjoy it now
Jackson and Rico were the best part of the show by far, their banter was hilarious
Honestly I think the show quality really went down in the last season
Yo remember jake????? He was legit my favorite character on the show! I was literally always rooting for jake n miley...Jessie literally never connected with me (even after jake literally cheated on her..I thought he was still a better fit than jessie)
I love the fact that both he and Trin (aka- my YouTube husband and wife) reacted to her in the same week 😂
Off topic but I think I’m in love with you…
do  the wizards now dylan please
27:15 ikr!! Also it's like ya'll JUST did an emotional goodbye and now you're just gonna undo it!!????
i liked the movie more than the show tbh, better plot line, acting, characters… jesus it’s a kids movie
ouu I got an interesting first and last. Flight 29 Down. It even has Corbin Bleu
I remember CRYING at that last episode when I was 13  I was literally like "omg this is the most relatable thing I've ever watched"💀💀
FINALLYYY ANOTHER DYLAN VIDEO AND IT'S MY CHILDHOOD SHOW LOOOOVE
I think we need to remake all kids movies into adult ones - like Descendants as an adult movie where you get to explore generational trauma, actually terrible shit, really fighting and blood? brooooooo it'd be so good.
I never watched it...now I don't feel like I missed out on anything...thanks Dylan
I hope he does this for other live action disney shows.
CAN YOU WATCH OG ICARLY PLS
I loved this show when I was a kid, but I don't guess I watched the last season cause I don't remember that newer house at all lmao. I also didn't know that she revealed that Hannah was actually Miley. The last big thing I remember watching was the whole Jessie vs. Jake thing, and I forgot she chose Jessie until this video lol. Also love how they solved Jackson's problem (not being able to find a job) in the middle of the episode and apparently didn't touch on it again hahaha (unless Dylan just didn't show it idk).
I think the only show I actually watch as an adult and kid is that's so raven, I literally still watch that cuz it makes me laugh hysterically 😂
I recently rewatched a lot of Wizards of Waverly Place and I feel like it held up soooo much better than Hannah Montana Omg. I  seriously don't remember HM being this bad but I guess I was a child 🤣 The writing is seriously so bad hahaha but I loved it anyways
dylan I think you are to old to undetstand...
You should do first and last of once upon a time! That show went so off the rails you’d probably get a lot of mileage out of jokes 😂
Did trin and Dylan coordinate this orrr?
For fuck's sake, Dylan... Press the spacebar ONCE to bring up the menu. Press it again to play. If the menu is already showing then you only need to press once. Mystery solved.
Hannah Montana will always be my favorite show from my childhood but i rewatched the whole series recently and I didn’t like Miley’s character at all. She’s constantly whining and screaming that things aren’t going her way and it’s just not pleasant to watch
Anyone else recognize Jenna from PLL??
to me rico, jackson, and oliver were the funniest ones but there are wayyyyyy better episodes really . i wouldn’t say judge the whole show based on the first and last even though that’s what you do for content 😭 i personally still love the show and hannah montana the movie is GOLDDDD
hannah montana was my show
This is made for seven year olds, and the jokes dont hit in the last seasons bc you didnt see all of four seasons. And the ones that are the most funny are Lilly and Jackson
idk i think it's funny that you say "these jokes are taking too long" when your jokes also take too long...self attack! (love you babes but thought that was funny)
About Lily and Ollie's kiss being blocked. That's just a thing on Disney Channel shows, at least as far as I remember. With a few rare exceptions, on-screen kisses got blocked from view by a prop, a set piece, or even another character. Maybe they do things differently now, but when I was kid, we did not get to see any lips touching.
some disney channel shows you can watch as an adult and hannah montana just like, isn't it. THE MOVIE THOUGH THE MOVIE IS PERFECT
I’m honestly part of the camp that watched Hannah Montana religiously growing up only because it was on but I’ve always disliked it. The movie on the other hand isn’t that bad. 🤣🤣🤷🏽‍♀️
Hannah Montana is a stupid show.
Youve absolutely ruined it for me, and i couldnt be happier my man.
did he just compare to my favorite child hood tv show growing up to scare face and drug dealing? Uhmmm
Yeah Hannah Montana was only good during that time and as a preteen...and it can just stay there lol i will not be re-watching the entire series any time soon. I did really love the Hannah montana/miley concert documentary tho that was in theaters.
I have nostalgia blinders on for this show so you can't ruin it 😂 it's also a show my dad actually enjoyed and watched with us so that was super nice (he thought the dad was really funny)
"gold chain ...$3"  sorry
Didn't realize how ridiculous the college plot was when I first watched it. It's not like they'd have time for each other between classes, especially if they have different majors. And what does Miley need college for if she already has a lucrative career at her fingertips?
DYLANN THAT WAS NOT CHARIZARD! THAT WAS DRAGONITE
I got an ad for iCarly while watching this the nostalgia is thriving
And i love how Dylan is happy with his own jokes!! 🤣🤣
Dylan always end up laughing at the actor playing the stylist with the fake accent that he hates 😅
Dylaannnn the joke that you said was too wordy is an ongoing joke throughout the whole show
I used to be HM's biggest fan. But I stopped watching when she moved back to Tennessee
Please react to the Ali fight on degrassi. That is all.
Petition for Dylan to watch our favorite episodes, the ones that actually made us laugh
Watching the show as an adult is super cringe and the acting and jokes are really not that great however I will always love this show for the nostalgia. I was 8 when it premiered and 12 when it ended so it was a very important part of my childhood and I'll never forget that.
Bestie wait till you see the Hanna Montana movie that shit is *chefs kiss*
Omg he needs to watch Hannah Montana the movie😭
“Corbin green” 😂
The ad transitions are just getting better and better. I mean using celebrity greed as a segway to a honey ad? Genius.
ok hannah montana may not be the best show but she is legitimately one of the greatest pop artists of all time. he could be the one is one of the most powerful songs ever.
Please watch the Movies!
DO YOU NOT REALISE YOURE THE IMAGE OF THE BAD GIRL FROM "GET OUT"??!! REALLY?! TWINS
*gasp* “DEAD MOM?? YES”
I guess I stopped watching the show before the last season aired, because I have no memory of the college vs. Paris plotline.
Would have loved to see him realize who Oliver was in the last episode 😅
I really liked this show growing up (so much that I was Hannah Montana for Halloween in like 2nd grade or something) but I liked it growing up cause she was raised by a single dad so I guess there was representation but yeah when I rewatched it I was like wow this wasn’t as good as I remember and Billy Ray’s character was the only character I liked
Ahah i love that Dylan can notice a guy laughing in the audience... How can he be so perceptive??
Dylan really is an older Oliver😭😭
I was so obsessed with this show growing up 😂😂
as someone who has gone to college and gotten 2 degrees to go down video game tester route(probably subliminally bc of this episode), 25:03 hurts lmfaooo
wizards of waverly place was definitely better lmao
why you look like milo from atlantis the lost empire
Honestly, the first 2 seasons were the best. I started losing interest when they moved houses and oliver left. They def dragged it for too long.  Wheras, Wizards was good throughout and had a great, worthwhile finale.
Dylan ruining Hannah Montana  😤💀🤧
Not him making a hannah montana video right after trin 😬😂
I'm both excited and terrified for this 😂😂
"I thought they'd compare Hannah and Miley's feet, and that's how they found out." Dan Schneider enters the chat
You should definitely do WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE next!!! MUCH A BETTER SHOW from Disney Channel 😍🧙‍♀️🪄🔮
I thought this was going to be the film. Not disappointed though.
I learned english from hannah montana so i can never judge it and will always love it
hilarious, I grew up with Hannah Montana but never saw the finale until now...didn't miss out bc it's ass lol
React to WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE
Hannah Montana's double life, is literally what I wanted to be when I grew up. LOL
I love how Trin and Dylan posted Hannah Montana videos within the same like 3 days. Still waiting for a collab :)))
She was always called Lola "Luftnagle" I don't know why they added that voice over and changed it to lafanda?
Now watch wizards of waverly place next I'M BEGGING
You have to do the movie now
"it's a fake school!"  Dylan would know.
It's a hella catchy theme song. Hannah Montana came out when I was like a sophomore in high school so it wasn't something I watched often (I was phasing out of watching Disney channel at that point), but that theme song man...
It was definitely WAY better when I was younger. I was obsessed with Hannah Montana! I had the doll, her movies, and the video game. Back then, the whole premise of the double life of a superstar was so new to me. But now as an adult watching it back it wasn't so great. But that's the beauty in nostalgia. It brings me back to running home after school to watch Hannah Montana and Kim Possible.
it's a new shirt, I guess he finally went shopping
you should do first and last of "young and hungry"
I enjoyed the show, but looking back, I despise Miley Stewart. She was honestly a horrible friend and often treated Lily (or her brother and father) like crap. And despite what the show tells you to believe, she never grows up or learns from her mistakes.
the theme song is very catchy thank you for acknowledging that
Omg is this a new shirt, did Dylan finally go clothes shopping 😂
I'm Miley's age so I watched HM when it came out and was doing homework at night just to have background noise and I LOVED it. I thought it was so cute and funny. I never watched the last seasons so seeing them now... they were so bad!! wow! first 2 episodes were still cute and funny tho, not sure if that's just nostalgia doing it for me.
I love that even when dying he has the time and strength to make a that's what she said joke 😆 🤣  lol
I'm almost 22 so that was my childchood show and I was so hyped then, songs were great, plot entertaining and that was cool, but the last season weren't so good. Now I sometimes came back to that show and nostalgia. I think it is iconic along with Wizards of Waverly Place, Good luck Charlie, Jonas, HSM, Suite life, Lemoniade Mouth
since when does the like button do the little confetti thingies
I know we can’t recommend but I can’t help it DO VICTORIOUS
i wanted to be hannah montana SO BAD as a child 😂😭😭
wizards of waverly place is WAYYYY better. PLEASE WATCH IT
WATCH THE HANNAH MONTANA MOVIE
Yesterday I rewatched Hannah Montana and thought to myself ‘I need Dylan to react to this’
when are the kickelodeon shows comin'?
Wizards of waverly place>>>> the comedic timing in that show was always my favorite
You’re 30!? Damn
T H A N K G A W D😭👏🏼
Dylan: I hate this show.   Me: Eh, nobody’s perfect.
The way Dylan got jump scared by Corbin 😂
Zoey 101 Please 😍🙏🏼
The reason is that she is still famous even if she isn't in her 'normal life' she gets the best of both worlds, which is the whole premis of the show.
Please watch the first and last Episode of Naruto 😍😂🙏🏼
Season 2 and season 3 are way better. Had some good content. I love the episode where Jackson and Miley share a bathroom. You should try watching first, last, and 1 middle episode to get a better idea of a show.
Corbin green 😂
Disney Channel in the 2000s was my first exposure to crossovers.  Hannah Montana, Suite Life of Zack and Cody and Wizards of Wavery place had a three part crossover and it blew my seven year old self’s mind as I was a super fan of all three shows
you tried but you failed in ruining it for me
Why does this guy look like PewDiePie’s son?
You should watch A-X-L
You def ruined it for me I don’t remember it being this bad lmfao
YOU NEED TO WATCH WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE
“This looks like Miley’s feet” no Dylan that’s Nickelodeon. 😅
If Dylan wanted to see some action he shoulda watched the fish fight episode
I think a That’s So Raven first and last may be more entertaining for you probably
Omg I'm so excited for this I'm screaming
The Scarface bit was perfect 😂
Dylan: “I really wanted to be a part of the Hannah Montana community.”  Me: “Pfft!No you didn’t. Not off four episodes and that’s perfectly fine. Was funny to watch this vid anyways.”
Dylan saying Hannah Montana is a Scarface spin off has sent me already
i know you don’t do recommendations but idk… you should watch “the wizards of waverly place” :D
Omg my fav YouTuber watching my fav childhood show , I love to see it 😁💗
So Hannah Montana basically pulled the ‘I got off the plane’ ending from Friends?
today is my birthday and I just had a horrible day but coming home and watching this just made me so happy<3 thank u for always making my days a little better<3
I too remember being like ??? while watching the finale lol and I was very young that tells u something…
please please please do icarly or victorious next😭
I really needed this video tonight, thank u Dylan for always making me laugh even in the shittiest moments
Not me crying from nostalgia over *thissssss* help 😭😂
I’ve missed u wow
Watch Sonny With a Chance it was the Demi Lovato show!!!
Fun fact Miley and Lily's actresses actually hated each other the first few seasons.
I am not recommending anything… I’m just saying H2O is superior compared to any of these disney shows
When he said 'college is way overrated' I was expecting  'do you know how fast COLLEGES dissappear?!'
It started out so positive and quickly crashed and burned 🤣
Dylan I'm telling you, you need to check out Mighty Morphin Power Ranger season 1 on Netflix. It's the perfect content.
Dylan is literally my happy place... how did I even get here.
Man, the toxicity in this friendship. I remember seeing a few episodes when I was younger. Like on in the background, but I didn't pay much attention to it. But seeing it now at 27...no, just no.
I was 12 when Hannah Montana came out and hated it so much. I never saw the appeal but my friends were obsessed and tormented me i was so happy when it ended. 🤣
I didn't realise hannah montana was a show. I thought there was only the movie
Corbin green 💀💀💀😂😂
7:19 I DIED 🤣
okay so the first episode as a pilot is very different from the other ones. there are better episodes in season 1 and later seasons
the transitions are too funny! I want to see the footage of Miley singing them in the studio haha
The “say what” joke was so wordy cause it was meant to be the longest one they did in the series. It was a recurring thing.
Please watch Stuart Little and Stuart Little 2
The only show in which the humour still holds up to this day for me is wizards of waverly place. That's just my opinion
You should watch wizards of waverly place!!!
Seeing this now, I feel like Disney tried to capitalize on the “randomness” in shows like nick had, but it just doesn’t fit the vibe of Disney shows
recently rewatched Hannah Montana lol
You need to watch Hannah Montana the movie!! It's better and she's grown up
btw the long-ass "daddy say what?" joke worked bc it was a re-occuring joke throughout the show and it became longer and longer over the course of the show. like, they didn't just randomly throw that one in, there was build-up to it
The nose ring is hot
Crazy how the show started in middle school and then 4 season later they are in college?? It kinda works bc they look college age. I hate when shows have 25 year olds playing high school juniors/seniors that are supposed to be like 17.
Dylan definitely needs to watch iCarly’s newest season
wtf her name is lola luffnagle....why did they dub it over
I don't know why I'm waiting for you to do these with a canceled show, don't even know if that would be fun.. you'd probably find a way to make it funny tho
2:23 i pissed myself
in my opinion, the best disney channel show was "the suite life of zack and cody". and when it comes to "hannah montana", i think the 2nd season had the best episodes.
this show was a masterpiece
Dylan has to watch the episode with Jake
no but actually, you do
The movie is so much better than the show
you ruin everything for me..... oh ;)
Dylan: idk why she doesn’t wanna be known as hannah  Literally Miley Cyrus: I get the best of both worlds
7:22 😐😟😦
Loving the chain Dyl 👌🏽
watching shows you use to like when you're older and they aged liked like milk lol jckchdksuhdi a mess
College really is an overrated scam
This is a great reaction! 😂 Would love to see you react to the movie!
i've never seen a violetta reaction, i'd be really funny
This made me realise how difficult (or not) must be doing tv for kids bc you cant overthink it but at the same time it has to make enough sense but then again how can an adult tell how much sense is too much or too little when it comes to kids tv
“But then again I’m a narcissist” pleeeaaaseee😭
Okay but the movie is lowkey a cinematic masterpiece
I  loved Hannah Montanna growing up but I never watched the last season. It was fun watching you react
First episode was a tester so it was filmed before the rest of the season.  So it's not a good reflection.  Last season sucked ass.  It was really like end of season 1 and 2 that really got the attention of everyone.  There's also some jokes in the last episode that were a build up off all the seasons.  Like the "bunch of gibberish followed by say what?"  It wasn't as dumb and drawn out in the earlier seasons, but it devolved into a bad recurring line.  Granted I haven't watched the middle seasons since being a preteen - and yes the writing definitely sucked. But I will say the last season is not a good representation of the show.  But Dylan knows that.  That's why watching the first and last episode is interesting - it's rarely a good representation
no but i know dylan would like wizards of waverly place better
Even as a kid I knew this show sucked so hard. That doesn't mean I didn't watch every episode though lol
Ok but now I think it’s only fair you react to the MOVIE 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
The moment Dylan said “it saves famous people so much money” I literally screamed “HONEYYY!!”
perice your nose so you will always be young and never forget it!! 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
23:48 no.
I still remember watching the first episode when this came out. A lot of the references in the last two episodes had to do with running jokes throughout the series, so I'm not surprised they didn't land.
Hannah Montana was my entire childhood 😩
The series was "ok" both then and now, it was just kindof a filler series for me like if it's on I'll watch it but I don't actively wait/watch per schedule. The movie was great though better than the series imo. It had one of my favorite Disney songs, Bless the Broken Road by Rascal Flatts
I wish in the end they would do *one year later* and after the movie shoot Miley would go back and join college just with one year gap between them. Then they could have shown Lilies graduation ceremony as them being real close friends, and then , year later Miley'es graduation ceremony with Lily having a some kind of job. That way, they would show, that they both grow up in adult life and still are close like sisters to each other.
i love how i haven't watched Hannah Montana and so when dylan started that bit about scarface at the beginning I was like "damn fr? that's crazy :0"       ....yeah I haven't watched scarface either.
I remember this show so fondly but, watching it with you made me realize how cringe it was. I guess Wizards Of Waverley place was always superior...
I do not remember this being the last episode :0
“The emotional bits don’t hit” well Dylan it’s because you watched like 1% of the entire show 😭
I don't know why the "she's loud huh?" sent me
I think they made low-key/high-key 2 spin-offs of Hannah Montana with Mitchell Musso in Pair of Kings and Jackson in Kick It! both being on DisneyXD (the superior Disney in my opinion) which only lasted for a short while. Maybe check those out too if you ever read this, just a Lil Disneyworld building 😏😂 okay I'm done I'm sorry
dylan, just get your nose pierced.
you just had to be there
I loved Hannah Montana growing up but I must have aged out of it before the final seasons because I have NO recollection of that finale (and I’m kinda glad given how shitty it looks 😂)
Nickelodeon is the one with the foot fetishes. 😂 And yeah Hannah Montana isn't at the top of the list of shows I'd rewatch as a 22 yes old
I would love if Dylan started a series where he watched the worst episode of a bad tv show
I loved it when it first came out and I love it now, nothing has changed. Yes the jokes are a little cringey and the montage of it all is  not so great, but I remember how I felt when I watched it as a child and it just makes me feel nostalgic, cause Hannah was my hero. In my opinion it's one of the greatest shows Disney has ever created
Do the movie
I still love it 😍
omg like I almost cried during the intro song hahahahhah the nostalgia damn it-
react to legally blonde!!!
Watch first and list episode of gravity falls
Disney kids shows usually suck. But Nickelodeon on the other hand, are truly funny. Maybe give it a go. I suggest Ned’s declassified.
Wizards of Waverly Place next please
unlike everyone I knew, I did not like the show. I used to like Wizards of Waverly Place and zack and cody. and even those weren't that great...I'm probably just a hater I guess LMAO
Hannah Montana will always have a special place in my heart
I want to see wizards of waverly place next
dylan watching through our childhoods one video at a time
Honestly everyone loooooved 'Hannah Montana' but I always thought 'Wizards' was better. The jokes were better, the characters were better and we got Dwayne Johnson, Shakira and Cindy Crawford there
I love you the intro was awesome
oh i have been waiting for this
trin doing the movie and dylan doing the tv show. love to see it
I still sing the theme song, but I'd forgotten the trauma attached to it --- namely, the show itself.
i think it’s hard to relate when you didn’t grow up watching it lol
I've been waiting on this one. And this is NOT a recommendation I'm just saying, the movie is fire. And her music 🤷🏾‍♀️
I really disliked Lily, she was sometimes not a good friend. Like there was a reason Miley couldn't tell her she was Hannah Montana. I wanted to hit her so bad. She was upset because Miley wanted to do a movie instead of going to collage with her, like girl. Not everything has to be your way
I feel like we're in a relationship, I miss seeing your face and falling asleep to your voice, and you disappear for a few weeks. lmfao. cute. thanks for the standards.
“idk i just don’t see the appeal” - a 30 yr old man.  yeah i don’t think you’re quite the target audience dylan
I hope this was a hint for the next commentary being scarface
The honey transition was disappointing. When his throat went bad he should have gone like "I'm gonna need some honey to fix this which brings us to today's sponsor"
✨ CoRbIn GrEeN ✨
arree we owning the disney plus subscription
Currently living for Dylan's nose ring and Disney's interface hate
im convinced the nose ring isnt fake anymore
Bitch, I love you and I missed you. 🖤
One of the best aspects of the show for me was miley’s relationship with her dad. It delivered so well in the show since they are ofc daughter and dad irl too and they had some amazing moments. It was also special to grow up with Miley over the years and she’d have typical school dramas that you could relate to and the songs slapped. The movie was the peak though, Miley’s acting is amazing in it.
A+ ad transition.
Omgy
Just sitting here waiting for Dylan's inevitable sponsor segment and sitting through that. Doing my part. Goddammit... Why do you have to be a content machine?   EDIT: It's fucking Honey... I thought it would be Audible, but no... It's Honey... Damn you, Dylan!
I almost spit out my coffee on my laptop in the beginning when you started talking about Scarface. How dare you.
Hannah Montana had my entire childhood in a chokehold. I recently found my double sided Hannaha Montana/Miley Cyrus CD and my handmade Hannah Montana magazines 😂 we couldnt afford to buy the real magazines (we were in a recession!) so I made my own. Lol, good times
I remember watching HM a bit when it came out but I grew out of it fairly quickly. Rewatching it through you reminds me why. Not a fan of the cringy jokes, the overacting or the plot lines. And I agree with the ending. I understand wanting it to be a feel good end for all the kids who grew up on it, but I agree about the codependency. Maybe there was something about wanting to drive home higher education for kids? Idk Feels off sacrificing your dreams to stay glued at the hip with your childhood friend.
Did anyone else notice how the kids around Corbin Bleu at 2:49 are like babies compared to him? And yet they are eating lunch together like nothing is weird about it 🤣🤣🤣
Omg, I’ve just watched your HSM video and you mentioned Hannah Montana. I thought why hasn’t Dylan made a video about it? And here it is!
As someone who started watching Hannah Montana when I was 15... I did a re-watch last year as a 30 year old and still loved it =D
"I don't understand why miley doesn't want to be famous, there's so many privileges" because she wants the best of both worlds Dylan 😂 every time she wants to use famous people privilege she becomes Hannah, and when she wants the privacy of a regular person she's Miley
Trin and Dylan watching Hannah Montana on the same week is the commentators’ multiverse’s event I needed
Dylan no you have to react to the jonas brothers episode please lmaooo
Dylan I hate to tell you but the “audience members laughter” were a couple of prerecorded laugh tracks used all across Disney channel shows. Like, every one. 😂 This wasn’t filmed live
Im sorry but you’re like Jake peralta from Brooklyn 99 just with a lil more dash of confidence - not mad about it
I was hype then felt so bad for Dylan when I remembered what this series is and knew he was going to watch 3 of the worst episodes of the show lmaooo
u gotta watch pair of kings- way creepier mitchell musso
there’s a reason wizards of waverley place is the most watched disney finale! they should’ve left the hannah reveal till the finale (it was about 3 episodes before)
I'm re-watching the whole thing right now. Yes, Lily's natural tone is screaming a lot. Hopefully it gets better down the line.
this video just gave me so much serotonin
Wizards of waverly place>>>>>>
Please do the wizard of waverly place
Pro Tip: If we bully the bullies, it cancels out. It’s a double negative.  (I know this is a joke)
I LOOOVED Hannah Montana. I think the huge draw was the concept and the music. Miley gets to have her cake and eat it too, and it was cool watching her balance that in the show. The most jarring thing coming back to it later as an adult though is realizing that Miley was a literal CHILD. We're talking like 13-14. It's also scary that compared to other child actors, I feel like the only reason she wasn't literally abused was because her dad was there every day, and that's a frightening thought
wait till he finds out her secret was revealed first in the movie and no one tattled 💀
dylan copying trin ??
We need a Total Drama Island reaction besite <3
Dylan mad at his college for 30 min 😹😹
REACT TO THE MOVIE
I never saw the show, but my sister was into it. Lily is a kid I'd probably beat up purely based on her voice and how she talks.
Dylan, do a commentary on Sam & Cat
wizards of waverly place was way better anyways
And trin reacted to the movie this week 😌
I’ve never seen Hannah Montana but my jaw dropped when I saw Corbin
I feel like this show is so popular among our generation, because we grew up with it, we were kids and that's why we loved it... I don't think I would like it as much if I just seen it now... but still enjoyed the reaction and cant wait for Disney to be finally in my country so I can see the whole thing again <3
Remember miley writing in her biography Miles To Go that she and Emily Osment hated each other on set even tho they played best friends? Miley said she gets along better with guys than girls (she's not like other girls!) And as for Emily, well, I never heard her side of it.
I STILL remember absolutely freaking out when the Jesse McCartney episodes aired for the first time... This show was honestly great for the time, if you were a kid when it was airing.
The jake ryan plotline of this show had me on my toes every week! Honestly for me, s4 didn’t happen.
HES THIRTY?!
You have to seee the movieeeeee its so much better
Seeing Hannah Montana after all these years, yes it was bad lol.
A kids show with a murder mistery section is literally riverdale 🤡
yeaaah
Dylan using his Mickey voice cause he’s frustrated on a Disney video is so fitting. I spy a new method actor 😂 But also. I was just sitting here and waiting for him to make a reference to his 17 Again video.   “I don’t watch Hannah Montana. I watch Melissa and Joey- real comedy!”
not gonna lie, you didn't talk about your scam college enough for me
Do wizards of waverly place next
Thiiiisssss last season does not represent mee as a used to Hannah Montana fan!!! To be fair the fourth season was crap all together. It seemed very low budget and forced. I mean the first three seasons are not a master piece, but hell a lot better for sure.
still love it. i binge all 4 seasons once a year lol
The transition lines to the sponsor segments are always on point
when he was doing the honey sponsor my video stopped and i got an ad for honey, while eating honey nut cornflakes I ALREADY HAVE THE APP
I missed Dylan complaining about the space bar😭
Jackson and the dad had the BEST jokes!!
Paris over college any day! Are you kidding me?! I got to college so I can pray to even come close to get a job that allows me to afford Paris! Go to Paris!
I remember watching this and being like "Miley! Just go to college with your best friend!" And now Im sitting here going "You gave up on a multi billion dollar movie deal with Tom cruise for a scam? Dumbass." Ah maturing
Dylan watching Hannah Montana and Trin watching Hannah Montana The Movie has cleared my skin….their mind 🤯
Plz watch shameless
please watch the new pinoccio movie! you will be entertained
Pleaso do a binge of haunting of hill house 😱 i know u dont like suggestions but ey man dreams die last 😐😂
I know we shouldn’t recommend but… pls watch the Cheetah Girls movies lol
I looooved Hannah Montana as a kid. I still listen to most of the songs but it had been a long time since I actually watched the show. I have to admit yes it's cringe but so is most of these type of shows. The point isn't to have the adults like it, it's to have the kids like it. I remember relating to Miley's character as a kid because I wasn't popular either. And the fact that Miley had a different life where she was a star made up for how unpopular she was, and I guess I imagined that I also had a different life to feel better. Regardless of how cringe it is I feel really nostalgic watching it again and I would definitely binge it if I had the time.
You saw my recommendation
dylan making fun of mittle schoolers is the best thing i saw today
Yesssss I’ve been wanting this😂😂
I thought this day will never come... 😍
"You've got a lot to offer." "Like what?" ".....time."
Even as a kid I could tell that the first and last seasons sucked.   Think that's why this was so bad cuz he just watched the bit before the show knew what it was and the bit where the show kept going too long for the money. I thought "oh no he'll just watch the bad stuff" as soon as he said which episodes he would watch
WATCH WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE
I got interrupted like 10 million times watching this. Ruined my entire vibe
I hope Dylan knows that the laugh is a backing track
Love the content, dont change lo! 😁
I still love each of the ad segways :D
I really want him to watch the first and last episode of Gilmore girls lol
I waited for this so much you have no idea how happy i was when i saw that video thank you 🙂🙂🙂🙂😗
Dylan pls watch the whole show
dylan and trin posting hannah montana videos within days of each other is iconic behavior
I love Hannah Montana ❤️ but I also hated the decision Miley made in the last episode, she should’ve just come back after a year and join Lily. Also I still prefer Jake to Jessie so that annoyed me too. But it’s still great 👍🏾
Dylan: I have no emotional connection to these characters Also Dylan: Only watches 1st 2 and last 2 episodes……  People who actually watched it while it was on t.v: TRY WATCHING ALL 4 SEASONS PLUS THE MOVIE DYLAN
Jackson & Rico my favourite they are hilarious 🤣
this was literally my favorite show 😭it’s so cringe now
Noone can tell me that intro ain't catchy ... it was a bop. The show didnt age well tho 😂
everyone watching hannah montana what is happening
OMG YESSSSSSS I NEEDED THISSSS
i never even watched this show at all, i liked wizards of waverly place, jessie, austin and ally way more. i liked the hannah Montana movie and still kinda do, but the show never appealed to me at all, so thank you so much for roasting it and deciding you hate it lmao
it WAS a running gag that they never showed Lily and Oliver kissing
You gotta watch the movie next it’s so much better than the finale of the show
i remember the biggest plot of the show was the love triangle and miley having to choose between jake and jesse, THE STRESS PRE-TEEN ME HAD DURING THOSE EPISODES
Sia watched this show.
You need to upload more
Now I wanna binge what the serie.
yessss Dylannnn
I kinda feel bad for Jason Earles. He was stuck playing the part of a teenager while he was in his late 20s-30s and probably felt really weird that teenage girls liked him so much. I think that’s a huge problem with Hollywood, too. They cast adults as teens, those adult have a HUGE following of underage fans, some that are obsessed with them, and it doesn’t seem like a healthy thing for the fans or the actors. Think about it, it could be so easy for an adult, who acts as a teen and is made to look really young, to take advantage of a younger, more naive audience/fan, inappropriately no matter what gender of the fan or actor.
Fun fact! See if you know the answer!  *BEFORE LANDING ON THE NAME HANNAH MONTANA, PRODUCERS HAD NAMED THE TITULAR CHARACTER WHAT?* … … … … … … … … … … … … Answer: *ALEXIS TEXAS* Yes, that is a real fact 😂🤣
can u do another collab with kennedy walsh i loved ur guys’ banter 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
YAY A NEW VIDEO
now i need dylan to watch wizards of waverly place
Around the @16:40 mark, I love how the dad is speaking on the phone but has the phone like, a mile away from his face.
Jenna from pretty little liars?? Also, this show is so bad…
Dylan is wearing a 3 dollar chain.... Army, We've found a fellow army 😂😂😂
12 y/o me would be so pissed at you rn
praying he does more old disney shows cause damn I am loving this
“Why is everyone in a band”  It’s even funnier when u know mitchell mussos brother was in metro station lmao
what I needed now 😂
I never liked this show either, and I grew up with it
Honestly, in my headcanon, this show ended with the movie. The last two seasons aren't real
This was just a show I'd put on after school while waiting for the actual shows I wanted to watch. Like, it has nostalgia and some moments (the songs were catchy) but for me personally, it wasn't classed as the best. That belongs to That's So Raven and Wizards of Waverly Place. After a long school day and your brain has shut off, it's easier to watch tbh
I next need a wizards of waverly place video😂 ik ik no recommendations but something tells me dylan is gonna love the character of Alex Russo....
Just when I was thinking when is he gonna plug in an ad bam honey
okay but like how is Dylan so good at guessing what's gonna happen, I mean its a true talent
You should watch that’s so Raven next
the last ep is more emotional when you grew up watching it for years
Finally!
Dylan is the only YouTuber that manages to make me smile with his ad transitions
Dylan judging my childhood staples is what I'm here for
My favorite part of all his videos is how he always introduces the sponsor lmao
i just realized i can't even remember the last chapter for me it truly ended when she took off the wig after that it was kinda boring
So I loved this sho even as a 15 yr old but I watched some episodes back a few yrs ago and like you I just could not get what I loved about it
dylan’s gotta do a first and last episode of lab rats
The Hannah Montana love is mainly nostalgia. When you're a kid you are oblivious to the cringe. It was the biggest show on Disney at the time and Miley is one of the biggest stars to come from it so it's linked with fond memories of being a kid , growing up watching the show and seeing Mileys career develop. The love isn't really because it's an amazing show lol. Watching as an adult it's obviously not very good but that's to be expected coz it's made for kids. The best Disney show of this time for me is Zack and Cody. The jokes were actually funny and had a bit more intelligence behind them.
No fkg waayyyyy 🥲🥲
Dylan it’s not impactful cuz you aren’t a 10yr child watching this dam show for 5 years crying 😭😭😂😂😂
the issue with the ending of this show is that they dragged it on in the last season. the emotional pay-off happens in s4e9 when miley reveals to the world that she's hannah, but then they tacked on 5 more episodes afterward that just kind of watered the whole thing down. the comedy and acting is very hit or miss tbh i think the strongest part of the series is actually the music - a lot of fun pop stuff from "hannah".
Please watch first episode of suite life of zack and Cody and last of suit life on deck
Naturally if you grew up watching a kids' show, there'd be that sense of nostalgia that won't be there if you watch the same show for the first time as an adult. But I also feel like shows for kids aren't built like shows for adults where there's a season long mystery or fight between characters or something similar, cause children just don't care about the suspense for so long. Which might be why a kids' show would feel very anticlimactic when it resolves all its issues so fast, especially if you're watching the show for the first time as an adult
U should definitely do the movie
What a terrible ending. She should have stayed in Paris. The reality of life is that you will have to make some big relationship sacrifices to follow your dreams. It would have been way more impactful if they had stayed split up. They could have even done a fast forward for the ending where they meet up at a restaurant or something 4 years later. They are both older but it shows how they are still best friends even with time and separation.
season 3 is really where its at
Dylan why don't you react to Wizards of Waverley Place, it was my fav Disney show so why don't you ruin it for me? XD
I used to love Hannah Montana when I was in the 4th grade hahaha! The show was really meant for kids to early teens and that humor was already the best with the cringe and all. This was really nostalgic!
Wow banger vid ❤❤❤🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐🛐
Dylan please react to "The Suite Life of Zack and Cody"
Dylan do you know that Disney can take down your video from 2:13 to 2:16 because of the song ??
Honestly loved Hannah Montana growing up, and watching back the older episodes are pure cringe but I loved the rest of them with random cameos from the Rock and Dolly Parton, I did however hate the last season and found everything a bit off about it. Feel like it should have ended at the movie, which I think is one of the better movies made from a tv show.
I remember bawling my eyes out at the finale episode bc I never missed an episode and it felt like saying goodbye to friends you grew up with. Definitely looking back now its way more cringe than I remember tho.
One thing I never understood from Disney is that they have the raw footage of HM but they couldn’t make the first 3 season in 16/9 ? THE billion dollar franchise HM not in 16/9 ??? Can’t believe it
okay then do wizards of waverly place
you know this was a big part of my childhood and I think that why I still like the show but I have watched every episode so I feel like you can only really like it if you watch like the good episodes and without those it is really cringy which is valid because it is but it also fought me a lot weirdly and its just really entertaining🤷🏾‍♀️
Yeah, it’s really not the same unless you grew up on it, that’s where the connection is.
I feel sad that he haven’t watched it when he was younger 💔, but when I watch it know OMG it’s not funny 🌚.
I used to love this show. Haven’t seen it since it finished don’t even remember what happened besides she had two identities and one of them being a singer. Then again I was six years old when it ended and I stopped rewatching it like are 10 years old probably so that makes since. Love this reaction!
it's not a dylan video unless he makes a joke about getting scammed by a college..
dylan making smooth transitions into sponsorship ads with jokes and then laughing at his own jokes is the shit i signed up for
U gotta do that's so raven 🤣 way better than HM
i was watching Hannah Montana last night, i didn't remember it was so, so Disney,,,
Dylan's ptsd about college coming through
Dylan: You like this chain? 3 dollars
i really don't think you ever find out how her mom passed but she shows up in a few eps
One of the many enjoyable aspects of Dylan Is In Trouble are the sponsorship segues💀💀
The laugh track guy reminds me of a short story I read about laugh tracks. Unfortunately, I can’t remember the name of the story, the name of the book or the author.
As a grown up u can't get the same feeling and vibes from this like we did as kids. This seriers hit HARD as a 11 years old. I'm 26 now. Honestly they knew their target audience and produced that whole thing to be extremely addictive for them.
The fact that Dylan will never know the Jake and Miley era is actually devastating!  Edit: Thanks for the likes y’all
the show was good for its time and the music was catchy. the makers just didnt want to break the hearts of a million little kids which is why they went w that ending
YESSS! This is all I've ever wanted!
I hate hate gum. I always have and it stems from the second episode. I can’t decide if it’s from the black mouth or the aunt dropping it on him. Either way… 🤢 I’m traumatized
look i was 5 or something i didn’t have the brain yet so this is even to this day yes my childhood and i still see it on a pedistal i can’t help it
watch wizards of waverly place or zack and cody!!! i think they aged better than hannah montana
Still love the show and you absolutely nailed it about Jackson. He has some of the best comedic bits in the show and it’s even better when it’s him and Oliver.
Please react to the Hannah Montana movie it's great
Me waiting for Dylan to post 😑 Me: After watching his video 😆
YOU'RE 30?! God you look like you're in your early twenties jajjaja. I'm acting like I've got a chance with you, I'm fucking 18
Do wizards of waverly place 😫😫
lol as a kid i never realized how wierd it was for the poc characters to be the "bullies" to the two white girls😂
Why doesn’t she wear a wig cap under the wig.
why dose the title say 30 year old i thought he was 33
next do Thats So Raven ?
This show was definitely better when I was 14
It would be pretty interesting if Dylan is creating a list which movies he actually liked XD
I can’t believe I’m admitting this but I actually got mad at Dylan for interrupting Hannah Montana at one point
I'm still waiting for Dylan to watch iCarly. I know he hates recommendations and I hate how I have no choice but just wait and hope this happens
12:24 bye I'm dying
I'd def recommend reacting to Wizards of Waverly Place!!!
YO UDONT UNDERSTAND HOW HAPPY I AM RN
I don’t remember any of the ending of Hannah Montana so maybe I never even saw the last season
I got hooked on HM after stumbling onto a s1 episode where she has to pretend to date her brother as Hannah. I couldn’t believe Disney would go THERE in an episode, so I kept watching. 🤦🏻‍♀️
i grew up with the show there is no ruining it for me but i think you would have enjoyed the jake cheating on miley conflict
i remember that ending song hit my 9 year old self like a ton of bricks. i bumped it ALL DAY pretending to have a fight with my imaginary bestfriend
yo you ruined it for me. I loved this show as a little girl and now rewatching it with you i was like this sucked how could i have enjoyed this so much at the age of 12
Best moment ever was def the reveal-concert. The season that followed that was horrible and it should have ended at the big reveal as that was the whole point of the show
Hello daddy Dylan!!!! Loving the content today. Celebrating a huge day not only with life but also with your vid.
See with Hanna Montana, and really any Disney Channel show, it really doesn’t dawn on you how cringe it is until you’re older… with that said I do love Hanna Montana and a lot of other shows but that’s really because I grew up watching them… when you watch them as an adult it’s of course not the same…. I find this video extremely hilarious because Dylan really is pointing out the bad 😂😂 even though I have a lot of love for this show, I’m not naïve to the fact that the writing isn’t great
DYLAN NOOOOOO you should’ve done a movie commentary for the hannah montana movie!! that movie is genuinely SO good on its own & in my opinion appeals to a wider age range. so much of the fun with the show is the banter between rico & jackson + them trying to balance her double life & you missed all of that (plus growing up with it also just makes it better lol).
Watch wizards of waverly place i beg😭
Tell me why I thought he was watching the movie😔
too much good vibes in here!!
I've always wanted this to happen. Finally, my dreams have come true.
You should watch Hannah Montana the movie 🎉🎉🎉
You should have seen the alternative ending
nah Dylan needs to watch The Suite Life of Zack and Cody lmao now that show was 10 times better than Hannah Montana & the jokes were funnier
thank you! I've never seen the appeal either! wizards of the waverly place was a loT better. this and icarly were honestly just not it for me
i was today years old when i found out dylan was 30
The part where she speaks really fast about a bunch of things and says  "say what?"  at the end is actually funny if you know the series :)   because it was never that long before, it was only a few words with "say what>" at the end, so that was like the last episode joke type thing :)
i loved this show, but i was the target audience. you know, a 10 year old girl....
dylans content>> anything else on youtube
6:42 i feel like Good Luck Charlie does a great job at that, they had stuff for kids and adults
i promise this is not a recommendation but wouldnt it be fabulous to be inside the MINDS of CRIMINALS ??????
i got a Miley Cyrus perfume ad lol
Yeah Dylan, the Foot thing is a Nickelodeon thing. She's safe.
Hannah Montana was only four seasons? When I was kid I felt like it went on for so much longer. Lol
You should watch Wizards of Waverly place, like I still genuinely find that show funny
Dylan, at some point I hope your able to watch the first and last episodes of The Originals!
What are the chances both Dylan & Trin released Hannah Montana commentaries / reactions in the same week?! Glitch in the matrix or I manifested it 😈
Y'all. I literally had a dream last night and Dylan randomly showed up in it, and now he posted today. I'm not saying ya girl is psychic, but... ooga booga? 🤔👀😂 Haha anyway, love this video as always, Dylan! You just have the best personality and hearing you laugh and your goofy jokes always brightens my day! ☺️💕
watching the first 2 episodes is PERFECT for this show. i have no idea how it ended, i outgrew it.
the episode before is where she reveals her secret to the world. I watched it as an older teen then again as an adult
As someone who has rewarded the show as an adult. These are literally the worse episodes of the series.
just wondering how did you convince yourself to call yourself 30 in the TITLE!..LOL           cauz actually you're 31 DYLAN
Nah Wizards of Waverly Place was the shit! I was never that much of a fan of Hannah Montana. Wizards was it!!!
nah Hannah Montana ain’t that good, Wizards of waverly place on the other hand, the superior Disney show
The movie is much better
I see comments saying yall didnt realise how much the show actually sucked or whatever,  and im not saying it was my favorite show or the best there was, but you guys do realise those were the 2 first episodes ever, meaning the show deeefinitely got better as it went on ? Also i remember even as i watched the last season at the time it felt like the cast was not in it at all, and it wasnt my favorite either. All that to say i think its a little unfair to base the opinions on unfortunately 4 episodes of, in my opinions the worst seasons of that show
I was their main demographic for this show when I came out, and I was never that into it. Like I'd watch it if it was on, but never made it a point to sit down at 8pm or whatever to watch it. My friends and I never talked about it. Rewatching it gives me so much cringe.😂 And only cringe.
I remember this, Ed Edd n' Eddy and Code name kids next door as my fav shows when i was younger and this show had some good songs if I recall
I would love to see ur commentary on "Alexa & Katie"
Have any troublemakers seen the show Psych with James Roday? it’s a great show but Dylan reminds me INSANELY of Shawn Spencer the main character! i mean this in the best way too
The first and fourth season are bad. It's two and three that are just... *chef's kiss*
Me: *sobbing*  Dylan: There’s just something about it that doesn’t seem impactful.  Ya had to be there Dylan 😂
Those transitions are so much more cringe than I remember 😬
It’s Dylan never getting over College
...you made me realize that i was born when you were 10 years old...
omgomg i hope he does wizards of wavery place >:)
omg i missed content like this!!! love u dyl❤️
Try to react to friends please
Dylan is right about the lesson about ending codependency. It would hit closer to home for teenagers who grew up with the show. My best friend and I went from all of our high school classes together seeing each other at least 5 days a week to going to universities in different states. I miss her like crazy and it’s hard but when we chat on the phone I get to hear all about her dreams coming true and she gets to hear about mine. That’s supportive friendship and that’s what should’ve been on the show.
I never watched Hannah Montana as a kid and then last year I watched the movie and it was basically a Disney version of a Hallmark movie it was amazing
I regret having sisters.  The wizards of Waverly oz was still good tho.
Wow Miley and Oliver became friends when she should’ve filed a restraining order against him by the pilots end
I thought this was hilarious
This just shows how Hollywood has been using propaganda to push everyone to go to college. And that’s why now I know too many people with useless degrees, student loan debt, and working jobs that they could’ve gotten without a degree. Hopefully people start waking up that college has become an extremely profitable business and is not about education. Unless you are going into a field that uses math and sciences, save your money, go to a trade school or something to learn an actual skill, and then study literature, arts, etc on your own with use of the internet.
ok not to be weird but why didn’t they show those two kissing at the end?
I think Miley was actually 11 during the pilot
you should definitely watch wizards of waverly place
One of the best sponsorship transitions ever! 😂
F-First time?
That fake Standford college hitting a little too close to home for Dylan
in the past, sometime 😭😭😭
Okay but that episode of Hannah Montana was actually why I thought it was okay to be mean to "bullies" as a kid  Except they weren't really bullies I was just super defensive
the last season is so bad, 1st and 2nd are my favorite cause they're just silly and fun
watch good luck charlie
Oh I hoped you were watching the movie
Can you react to Wizards of waverly place please ?
i was definitely a wizards girl over hannah montana as far as disney sitcoms went but i did watch hannah montana a lot.  i just watched a ton of tv in general as a kid.
My favourite part is the cute translation tunes they had between scenes.
hey :) so i was gonna do a notice board on my mc world w everyone’s names on so if you’d like to be apart of it <3 reply w your name and what color you’d like your name to be :) goal is to reach 100 names, currently at 9 names
Hannah Montana the Movie  That’s the one
More girly movies reacts please
The ADR moment was so funny to me. I never noticed that lol
Not the Emily Osment slander… her brother was the kid in the Sixth Sense… have some respect 😂
Funny that Dylan saw this and said “oh the guy from 5 feet apart” meanwhile when I saw 5 feet apart I said “oh the guy from Hannah Montana”
The Dylan is in trouble voice over 😭
By skipping to last 2 u miss her big reveal to the world lol
Dylan's video has disappointed me. 🙃
*sees Hannah Montana*  Sir, you make me happy 🥹
DO MORE DISNEY SHOWS THIS WAS FUN !!! LIKE WIZARDS OF WAVERLY PLACE OR SOMETHING
Interesting he uploads this, especially after Trin just did a commentary of the movie a few days ago 😏
I clicked on this shit so fast 😂
"I have a picture of her feet!" This is Disney, not Nickelodeon.  (Not that I'm defending ANY of the Disney channel's writing from this time period....)
About the yelling girl: Did her acting get worse after Spy Kids somehow, or is that just the character? 'Cause I have a hard time believing Haley Joel Osment's sister was a bad actor.
Seeing these little bits of it now, I don't think it's as great as I remember.. I had posters and clothes and book covers and I even had a Hannah Montana watch and even clothes similar to her style, I even signed up for singing competitions even though I can't sing well just because of my love of Hannah and because I wanted to be Hannah.  I used to keep newspaper cut outs of Miley too. I still have all that stuff in a box somewhere. But watching the bits of Miley and Lily friendship dynamic in the first and last episodes is not making me remember all that love I had instead it's making me reflect on my friendship with my childhood best friend who is now my ex best friend.. It is just so toxic to think that you MUST DO CERTAIN THINGS IN LIFE WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND. Like I have different dreams than those I had when I was 10, and I'm not the worst friend and person in the world just because I changed my dreams when I actually grew up as person and learned new things while you refuse to grow up and never change your opinions because you're too stubborn to obtain new information and see things from a different perspective and then paint me as the villain. As I finished typing I just realized how this rant sounded but I needed to get it out.
I never thought Hannah Montana was a good show. Wizards of Waverly Place and Suite Life of Zack & Cody were way better both acting and writing wise. That being said the Hannah Montana Movie is genuinely great, far better than the show, so I hope you react to it :)
You and trim are so in-sync ! I have to keep re watching the same movies hahaha
my earliest record yay
Alright now u need to watch the perfection of cinema that is the Hannah Montana movie
I can’t catch my breath from laughing so hard and it’s only been 1 minute since he started watching it! 🤣 I’m in the middle of eating Mac N’ Cheese and I’m already choking! 🤣
Can't wait for movie commentary Monday some day in the week. 😂😂
funny thing is I never watched the show but I did really like the Hannah Montana movie as a kid. Havent watched it in a while but I do remember memorizing the dance steps to the hoedown throwdown song
You made me see a side to Oliver I never noticed but he will always be my Olli-pop.
2:50 my friends when I tell them I like a guy 💀  why is this my favorite part 💀😭 I'm so glad dylan had a great time
I just found out that "Amber" is Beyoncé's cousin and I felt the need to share that information😂
Dylan: “I don’t know what it is, even the emotion parts don’t hit like they should” Me: “hmm its like you need to watch all 4 season in order to be emotionally impacted” 😅
I rewatched all my childhood disney and nickelodeon shows last year and while Hannah Montana and Lizzie McGuire were the ones I could barely get through, iCarly and Wizards of Waverly Place were still soooo good. Maybe do a video on those? I‘m getting the urge to rewatch them as I write this LOL
omg yesss finally
I may be this man's only male fan...    ...we also have the same name.
U should watch the first ep of Miraculous tales of ladybug and cat noir and last but twist both the pilot and finale both have 2 parts
YOU reacting to Hannah Montana..you trying to get me pregnant!?
I watched all of Hannah Montana when I was younger, and like, I did like it, there was a reason I watched it all, but I've always thought it's a bit overrated. Compared to other dcoms like Wizards of Waverly place and Good Luck Charlie it just doesn't hold up as well.
I think it definitely jogged some good memories of season 1/2, where they were in the first house and Rico worked at this tiki bar, but I wouldn't be able to watch it now. That was the show in 1st grade I forced myself to like because I was supposed to like pink and boys and stuff.
Watch the Hannah Montana movie !!!
this made me realize the first two episodes were so bad 😭 but it gets so much better with the Rico vs Jackson plots, and Miley’s dad and Jackson were hilarious too. But the best character? ROXY THE BODYGUARD 😩
had to give a thumbs up just for the transition into the sponsor, it's a great video regardless but that really topped it off how pleased Dylan was with himself
please, now you have to watcg thhannah montana- the movie !!
Nah dude, I’m 30 also and I have my nose ring still
Bro, unfortunately Hanna Montana WAS a part of my childhood (to an extent), and I HATED it! Even as a kid! Of course the "cringe" went right over my head, but I still hated how plots were introduced and resolved, it always sounded and looked stupid. but for some reason, I still watched it whenever it was on.... I guess "hate-watching" was implemented in me from quite a young age xD
WHY THANK YOU
I wish he would watch the best ranked episode too to get a better understanding of the show lol
dylan them saying goodbye isn’t gonna feel impactful to you because you didn’t actually watch the entire show and got attached to their characters and their friendship💀💀❤️
Dylan's college had given him some serious PTSD 🤣
I loved this show! That finale made me cry 😢❤️
WATCH THE HANNAH MONTANA MOVIE!!!!
I hope Dylan does The Wizards of Waverly Place too someday, it's so much better than HM imo
The last season honestly sucks. The first 2 seasons, part of season 3 are the best. A lot of people said that when Miley made the movie and the last season, she wasn’t wanting to do Hannah Montana anymore so you can see that lol
Dylan laughing on his own jokes is funnier then the jokes themselves 😭💀
I'm suspicious of  anything dylan says. I always think it's ad transition.
Honestly loved the show sm but it is not re-watchable at all. Some other Disney Channel shows from that time definitely are though.
Wizards of Waverly Place was clearly the superior show
Hannah Montana was def. a show for children even when I was a child, but I'd say Wizards of Waverly Place is a bit less childish while still being made for children. I would love for Dylan to watch it 👀
Haven't started video.   I feel like Dylan is going to like it.
This morning I was hoping that Dylan would upload today.
DYLAN OH MY GOD I MISSED YOU IT'S BEEN WEEKSSSS
Yeah Hannah Montana definitely hits different as an adult. I tried to rewatch the show when it first came on Disney+ but I just could not. It was SO boring! The only shows that still make me laugh as an adult are Wizards of Waverly Place and the Suite Life shows
Famous Last Words: “I would never be this cringey.”
The finale two part episode thing was so bad. Other than that, it was consistently funny throughout
Yes!!! I 've been waiting for Hannah Montana!!! Edit: God! The nostalgia attack I got after watching this... Like if your childhood was Hannah Montana
damn bro i just wanna be a child again and watch HM and all of these yk…. back then when life was good and happy :(
Maybe it's because it wasn't my generation (that sounds old :D) but I never enjoyed Hannah Montana tbh. It was just too... excessive and it didn't deliver as good as other shows imo. But I know many people who liked it.   Personally I was more into the series Lizzie McGuire. It was also a bit exaggerated at times but it also had some funny jokes, lines and life lessons. Plus awesome characters. (And the movie did Hannah Montana better than Hannah Montana :D).
Y2K Disney Acting is loud.
If oliver had said that “speaking of feet” joke Hannah Montana would’ve been a Dan Schneider production
Amazing video! 😂😂😂 watching this as an adult is indeed really cringey but so fun 😂
The day he does this for BBC Merlin is the day I can be truly happy
The last season of HM was so bad
Half an hour i'm blessed🙏
when quarantine started my friend and i binged old disney channel shows- hannah montana bening one of them. The show overall is okay, there’s some funny parts here and there. But, what was really weird was there was a couple episode that felt like a fever dream & both of us felt that way while watching, so that was weird. Like i said it's an okay show, it's one of those nonsense shows you put on and play in the background while doing something else.
I remember this show made me cringe so hard… and I was 6 years old.
I never knew I needed this in my life. Dylan’s initial explanation of the show is genius 😂
Hannah Montana was okay, i did enjoy it as a kid but to me one of the best Disney shows was pair of kings, atleast up to season 2 because they ruined season 3
you should watch wizards of waverly place next but watch the first episode of the 1st and 2nd season and then the last episodes
I'm glad someone else understands the frustration of the Disney+ interface.
9:16 lmao
I loved watching Hannah Montana growing up. I watched it religiously. I owned all her records, watched the movie opening day. Now, that I’m an adult. I rewatched Hannah Montana and oh my gosh I hated it. It’s honestly one of the worst shows I have seen.
I have no connection to this show, but after watching this video it worked much better when they were kids
You need to watch Wizards of Waverly Place. You are going to love Alex Russo. Also, the dead mom of Miley is played by Brooke Shields.
Thank you for saving me from ever having to watch this show. Fantastic work. You've once again saved my life. <3
No matter the cringe I think we can all agree on 1 thing. That *"The Best of Both Worlds"* is an absolute banger of a theme tune👌🏻
I love Dylan's videos e never fails to make me laugh, keep up the great work!!
I never watched Hannah Montana as a kid😂 Jessie & Good Luck Charlie is where it’s at
from what i remember, the earlier seasons were a lot more funny & humorous than the later. by the time the last season hit, even as a kid I could feel everyone, esp miley and whatnot -was over it and wanted to move on so even the way she delivered her lines changed, her energy shifted (its understandable though) and the writing got lazier but you know, it was okay for its time but looking back, its one of the disney shows that probably don't have the best longevity in terms of the entertainment value but i feel the earlier seasons like 1-3, a bit corny but you could still get a good chuckle out of them even now, even if it's out of mcokery. series's like wizardsofwp, suitelife, thatsoraven, pairofkings, from the top of my head are ones that aged quite well imo.
Dylan vs Space bar 2 coming to you any next Monday ….. maybe
The long-winded ‘say whaaa?’ joke was a recurring thing throughout the series, the joke was that it was just always getting longer and more convoluted before she said the ‘say whaaa?’ part
Dylan’s gotta be top 3 on YouTube in terms of Ad read transitions. Dylan, Oversimplified and The Pod boys always bring it for their ad reads
I literally posted in the subreddit today about how I was worried about you because you haven't posted in a little while. 😅 Glad to see your okay, bud. 👍🏻  Hannah Montana was one of my favorite shows as a kid, but now I don't like the humor in it so much anymore either. This was fun to watch. Good pick, Dylan. 👍🏻😊
PLS watch the hannah montana movie im begging
I think the thing about kid shows (or at least watching them when you're a kid) is you want everyone to be together. You want them to choose their best friend or their family or whatever over any type of separation (even if it's for personal goals) bc it's like the story continues and you know with certainty that they were happy together (bc you watched the show) and now you know they'll continue to be. I RARELY did well with cliff hangers like that & the only show I can think of where they separate is iCarly and Suite Life on Deck.  I guess they could've had it where Miley and Lily video called or something from their separate places so they still each followed their dreams... idk... overall, I think Hanny Montany did a good job with those plot lines like the dead mom, cheating, secret boyfriends, etc. but lowkey, it was always #2 to Wizards of Waverly Place... (or at least went back and forth)
i missed this omg
Thank you Dylan for the honey and audible bathroom breaks you give us. So considerate.
DAMNIT Dylan I was really hoping that 10:48 would lead to a Sour Patch Kids sponsorship😔
mileys friends not realizing shes hannah montana gives the same energy as harvey not recognizing joker before he took the mask off
It's the last do it that did it
Why the emotional bits does not affect you is becuse you did not watch this show since you were a kid and then until your late teens. You did not follow the characters for years on end for them to separate.
honestly jackson and rico CARRIED the humor in this show they were so funny
Dylan you need to watch good luck Charlie!
I definitely loved Hannah Montana growing up but the last season was not it for me, I don’t know I think after she moved into that house it went down hill lmao
If you haven’t seen Scarface, you should. Do a video about it while you’re at it👍🏼
Dylan schouldnreact to kdramas  1.the penthouse 2.tomorrow 3.train to busan 4.BOYS OVER FLOWERS YOU NEED TO REACT TO BOYS OVER FLOWERS IT WILL MAKE YOU SO ANGRY
The moment dylan said "saves famous people so much money" I knew a honey sponsorship was coming haha 🤣
tbh the only really good thing about Hannah Montana is the nostalgia, and the movie wasn't bad. Wizards of Waverly Place actually holds up though
Ngl, first time I stumbled onto your channel, I thought you were 25.
Like most young girls in the early 2000s I too was a fan of Hannah Montana, but I really only loved the movies and music as far as I remember. I think the show was one of those things I really only watched when nothing else was on (I.E., when Wizards Of Waverly Place wasn't on).
petition to get dylan to watch the hannah montana movie
I didnt remember Jackson's girlfriend is Jenna in Pretty Little Liars (the girl who can smell a bitch a mile away)
Say what you want about the show but the theme song still slaps
Dylan dying : that's...what she...said...😵💀
growing up with hannah montana as my favorite show, i think the best part about it funny enough is everything in-between. the beginning is super cheesy as a lot of disney shows can be and a lot of us og fans don't like the ending that much. it was the type of thing where they got into the rhythm of the show as it went on and then they fumbled the bag at the end. i think mid season 1-beginning of season 4 (so mainly seasons 2 and 3) best showcase why hannah montana was really enjoyable at the time.
I only saw a couple episodes as a kid but then found it on youtube years later and watched the pilot as a joke only to find myself way too invested when I was way too old for it.. its undeniably cheesy but there's something really comforting about it
you need to do a commentary on the movie it’s actually a cinematic masterpiece
the only disney show of that era that I didint like. the other shows were funny like wizards of waverly place and the sweet life. but this show I disliked for some reason.
dylan is expanding his wardrobe finally
Dylan needs to watch the Jesse and jake episodes
The beautiful thing about dylan is that no matter how hard he roasts something I love I will never be mad at him because he is just so charming
The way the bed used to be so emotional for me lol
Only 30 but he's always looked like a daddy😏
Pla do wizards of waverly place next
I remember my sisters and I being big fans of Hanna Montana in elementary school. We had dolls and watched every music video and watched the Hanna Montana movie.
Hi Dylan! Please can you do another submission/confession video?
The finale didn't do the show justice at all, it just made me hate Lily.
ya know dylan saying the longest "say what" doesnt work really hurt 😅 its hilarious cause its an established running gag throughout the show and therefore the longest one is great in my opinion
the first episode isn’t as good but it progressively gets better. Or maybe that’s me trying to convince myself cause I watch this regularly 💀😭
I NEVER CLICKED SO FAST 😂
It would actually be really funny if he watched the Movie now, i am curious what he would say to that in comparison to the series xD  Not a recommendation tho ;)
Even during misery.. Dylan will never lose the opportunity to make “that’s what she said“ joke .
congrats! you ruined it for me lol
i know u dont want recs but react to murder mystery plz
Dylan you just made me the happiest person ever with this omfg. Now I can die in peace 🙏🏻
ive been waiting for this one
Why did I think you were like 24
Ya seeing the show with adult eyes, it definitely misses a few beats. But I maintain that the movie is perfect
yup the finale was definitely weak and the plot felt unnecessarily stretched but there's many way better episodes and I was already aware of it so no, you didn't ruin my childhood bestie
The Hannah Montana that Dylan wants is one where Miley has to keep killing people who find her secret.
Now when I watch Disney with my kids I’m like whyyyyyyyyy. They always kill the mum too they know they know
Nope didn’t ruin it, i still cried at the ending lol
Making me laugh as always! Please Dylan, tell me you're going to play Episode again! I'm binge-watching it and I can't wait for another story from you 🤪 😋
I didn’t know I needed this, but I do
Yeah I have never watched this and I'm glad I didn't. I hate that they scrapped the good message of living your life for you. Codependency isn't healthy
Dylan's gonna die when he finds out he missed the*Hannah Montana secret is out episodes* and he couldn't tell from watching the finale
not even 3 minutes in and dylan made me jump with that yell for corbin bleu. this is going to be a ride to sit through
You had to have been there from the beginning to understand it 🤣 I remember watching the first episode when it aired and I just loved the show.. Had all the Hannah Montana merch and even went as her for Halloween lol.   The last few episodes were very sad for me and I'm a sucker for a slowmo end credit scene of all the seasons before it and capturing all the nostalgia of keeping up with the show for years. Makes me cry every time lmaoooo.
The show should’ve ended when Hannah Montana was exposed to the World as Miley
My main thought about this video is that you got a haircut.
Dylan watched PLL and did not recognize Jenna Marshall in Hannah Montana. I am disappointed but also I related.
"They haven't built this up for an emotional payoff". *Skips years of emotional prep* 🥴🤭
i was in shock from the title like??????? first time watching???? but I'm happy he's enjoying something from my childhood as an old fart
minus my mental breakdown which made me drop out, college was a very good experience. However I've never been to an american college, poor Dylan
Hannah Montana was Disney Channel's cash cow for a good while. They had the money. I have no idea why they didn't apply it to the show.
Watching the first 2 and the last 2 ….. I realize all the appeal is nostalgia. Lmao…   Granted I think the best moments are in the middle around when Rico comes in as a consistent character. Also Oliver and Emily are a bit toned down at that point. And some of my favorite running jokes were the dad jokes from billy. But you know … Nobodys Perfect
This guy is so glib. Lol it's just so entertaining to watch.
Dylan convincing me to rewatch this show for the twelfth time in under 30 minutes
You should also watch Hannah Montana The Movie :3 ....
YES. FINALLY. LETS GO. AND ITS HANNAH MONTANA?!?! YESS I FEEL SO BLESSED AND ALIIIIVEEEE ILL UPDATE WHEN I FINISH THE VIDEO
33,333 viewer HYPE
Dylan not understanding the "best of both worlds" concept and constantly asking why Miley isn't just famous the whole time 😂
Wow I grew up on this show, I mean grew up, I loved it. I can’t believe how much bigger they looked to me back then 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dylan, I love you. And my nieces love you too. Keep making us laugh, please. You're very good at it.
why is your face so nice to look at?🫤
5 SECONDS INTO THE VIDEO I AM SCREAMING I AM SO HAPPY I JUST AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Yikes Lily is actually horrible. How selfish can you be to want your friend to sacrifice their wants and dreams for yours wtf
Exhibit b of Dylan’s battle with Disney plus
10:39 privacy Dylan. Yes you’d get all these amazing perks and popularity but what happens when you just wanna go out and relax wether it’s alone or not? your privacy will forever be compromised and you won’t be able to enjoy peace, quiet and tranquility without people disturbing you.
To be fair, you watched two of the worst parts of any series, the premier and the finale. The fun parts are in between. But hey, I'm also 29 years old defending a show that wasn't even aimed at my demographic when it aired, so....you win lol
Dylan laughing at the way he introduces the sponser EVERY video is golden
I’ve been waiting for this one!
now watch the movie
From what I remember, season 3 was my favorite. It had the best episodes and the most interesting plot lines. Also Jackson was always the funniest character. I wonder if Dylan ever saw WOWP. This is not a recommendation! :D I just would want to know his opinion about Alex Russo, cause that girl is an icon.
The loud laugher in that audience is the person I aspire to be in life 😂❤
Dylan : uploads video 1 hour ago  30K views & 5.6K likes
WE MISSED YOU
I'm assuming we're now collectively on the hunt to find out who laugh track guy is. Would love a crossover video where you and him watch more hannah montana
The long “say what” quote actually made sense as an 11 year old who grew up watching Miley do the bits across all 5 years so as a 16 year old you’re like, “thaaaaaats Miley”
I LOVED this show growing up and would not rewatch it. I know what it was but it'll always have a special place in my heart. It was the perfect show for 9-15 yr old kids and thats okay😂 also i relisten to the songs not cause they were revolutionary but they were catchy enough and now hold nostalgia 😂😂
I loved the first 3 seasons when I was a teenager but somehow the 4th season makes me feel anxious lol. Idk the set, the plot and etc. smth lacks.
did he watch the suite life of zack and cody yet???
one thing that surprised me when i rewatched hannah montana was how little songs there are in the show
I think for me being close to Miley’s age I related so much to the show and really grew up with the characters. The show did a good part making you feel like they were your friends.
15:20 “I just keep expecting these plot lines that are fun”  *Dylan says while talking about death*
I love that I got a Miley perfume add during this lol
I knew he was gonna upload today. I felt it in MY BONES. No man can make me smile the way dylan does.
the part you're missing to share the same feelings as the HM fans is because you're watching as an adult, i watched other things directed at kids as an adult because i couldn't watch them when i was younger and i definitely don't feel that same connection to things i watched as a child, a big part of my life was High School Musical i was OBSESSED with it and i still watch it and feel the nostalgia and comforting memories from when i was younger, i watched hannah montana a little later probably mid-teens but i do somewhat still feel that nostalgia from it, it really is directed at children and there's nothing for an adult watching it, which is why an adult plotline maybe more mystery with her moms' death or something would be an interesting thing for adults to watch and enjoy along with the children, but back then things for children STAYED aimed at children HOWEVER i do enjoy watching you watch things i used to be obsessed with even if it's not to your liking, which is understandable when you're watching Hannah Montana as an adult LOL
Absolutely love this creator 😍 one in a million haha
I think the episode where Hannah comes out would’ve been better
Kinda wish he would’ve watched the episodes with jake and Jesse
Very nice of Dylan to tell us about his favorite childhood movie Scarface
8:09 A joke in 2006, a priceless gift in March of 2020.
The movie happened before these episodes
That Ketchup thing always made me cringe
am I the only one who thinks that if Dylan was a Disney show character it would be Alex Russo??
wouldn't be a dylan video without hoping for characters' deaths and child violence, while laughing at serious scenes.
Go watch victorious now
I'm going to say this with love... Dylan you're 30... When the show came out you were like what 15? It was never meant for you 😆
Oh wow this is really for children huh 😂 😂 😂
This show is pure nostalgia fuel and just seeing that opening song takes me back so it's impossible for me not to enjoy it, if only because it's so deeply ingrained in my childhood memories. But yeah, that finale was full of filler conflict and the ending with Miley deciding to return to college to be roommates with Lily was definitely anticlimactic.
I do think this two last episodes should NOT be the last ones. They dont have the same appeal as the ones when she has to come out about her identity. THOSE were the perfect last episodes, the drama with Lily is just boring.
Yeah the good jokes were all in s1 and s2 after that it's was kinda not that funny. This show definitely aged kinda poorly at least imo. It's still WAY better than Girl Meets World tho.
this is why i don't rewatch most shows i enjoyed as a kid. the magic just disappears and everything turns out lame
You should react to the HANNAH MONTANA THE MOVIE 🤣
Dylan losing his shit about some barely discernible random man laughing in the background is the highlight of this video for me.
The way he cracked a “that’s what she said” joke right in the middle of choking is why I subscribed.
You should watch Kickin' It from Disney
You should watch wizard of waverly place!!!
I have this on DVD😔 now I gotta go look for it
I grew up watching this show and I thought the last episode was when Miley took her wig off on stage. I don't remember this college episode
so weird watching this and finding it cringe. i remember crying my eyes out for that last episode
I forgot how old the cast looked by the end
to be fair, the only episodes you watched are one of the weakest ones. you missed a whole ton of drama, laughs, gags and amazing music.
this show felt like a fever dreams, i forgot there wasn't just a movie💀
I will never get over Dylan’s ad placement, it’s freaking genius.
Watching dylan in the middle of a competition rn but some things hold more value than others
I wish he does wowp episodes And movies
Fun fact. The girl Jackson was on a date with in the first episode was in my 7th grade class. She told us she had a much bigger role and that it was going to be a recurring role. Needless to say she never showed up again the entire series. She kept saying her lawyer was still negotiating her pay. Typical middle school cringe.
Segue King
dying? yeah! Missing the "that's what she said" joke? never.
Banger
I first watched it as a child and basically grew up with Miley and this show. So for me this is my childhood so when I now rewatch episodes i don't really see the cringe, i see nostalgia
For a moment, I confused Hannah Montana with Lizzy McGuire and thought that you were doing the latter and was puzzled why it seemed so different than what I remembered about it 🤣
30 seconds in and you got a cackle out of me thank you 💀 Hannah Montana the mob princess
When I was a kid I watched this show dubbed to Spanish so watching it now in english is like watching an entire new show 😂 a very bad new show hahahaha
You must see the movie please!!!
Dylan talking about murder:💗🤗❤️💕🥰😘💖💞😍 Dylan talking about college:😈😡💥💢🔥😠💀💣🤬
Please continue!!! I loved this
4:45 that´s exactly what would have happened if Dan Schnneider was the showrunner
Not trin Lovell and Dylan is in trouble both releasing movie commentaries on Hannah Montana
DYLAN the reason she's wearing the wig is so she can have the "best of both worlds"!! She can have the perks of being an A-list celebrity as Hannah and she can be a normal teenage girl as Miley. When she wants the glitz and the glam, all she has to do is wear the wig. When she gets sick of the celebrity stuff, she can go back to being an anonymous nobody. It makes sense when you see the toll that fame and Hollywood takes on a whole bunch of child actors. Sometimes kids just need to be kids and the wig lets Miley do that.
Dylan uploads while I'm eating.  Me: 🤸‍♂️🕺💃
This show was one of my absolute favorites growing up... I don't remember it being this cringe, lolol
I get paid $2 per hour 😭😭
I watched the show as a kid with my whole family so I have great memories with it because of that. But when I watch it back alone I’m either not as entertained or I would get frustrated with how selfish Miley’s character could be. Obviously there are all teenagers and so they are supposed to be selfish but Lily and Oliver never felt as bad to me.
You know it’s gonna be a good day when Dylan uploads a new video 😊
I gotta say....I was not expecting you to watch this show ever. I don't know why I am not very surprised though...hmm....weird.. Also...love exists in 6 th grade but not in the way it should...ra-pe does too. A...childhood.
Oh no it’s not the movie :(
He should do cobra kai or the Fear Street trilogy!
I can't believe there's a new Dylan's video and it's not a commentary about Netflix's "The Ultimatum"
Dylans laugh is contagious
I screamed YES in the library reading the title
Hello king.
❤️❤️❤️
Cool necklace, Dylan!
Hannah Montana will always be one of my favorite shows as a kid it was iconic!
A PRE-PAID LAUGH💀
It’s the maniacal laugh after the honey promo segway for me
How did you like The Last Kingdom season 5? I can't wait for the 7 Kings epilogue movie to come out!
ICarly next
Still a crowd favorite i love Hannah Montana that was my jaaaaaaaaaam now 26 and still know all of the quotes
I know you don't take movie suggestions but the Hannah Montana movie would be iconic
I think this show definitely hits different watching for the first time as an adult vs. watching it for the first time as a child and then rewatching it when you're older. I was like five when Hannah Montana first came out, and even though you can definitely tell the show was made for kids, there's so much nostalgia connected to it that I can overlook a lot of the cringe, if that makes sense. I totally idolized Hannah Montana as a child and thought I'd grow up to be a singer like her, haha.
I understand all your feelings about this show, even as a kid the humor didn't really click with me.
Dylan you should watch wizards of waverly place, in my opinion, it's so much better.
dylan’s analysis of what it’s about before watching it is absolutely hilarious
Emily Osment can act but every Disney Channel sidekick had to be screaming their head off.
you dont get it dylan i literally wrote the lyrics of wherever i go in a letter to my friend who changed schools and i thought it was such a powerful thing 😭😭 we haven't talked since the 8th grade ...
watching Dylan has made me so hypercritical of watching whatever shows now. I can no longer just laugh at stupid jokes without having some sort of critic for them to further improve the show
dylan looks like his last name would be johnson
So i googled it because it annoyed me.  Lola's last name changed to Luftnagle later on but the actress accidentally said Luftnagle when she was supposed to say LaFonda as the first draft of what her name should be. Stupid and makes no sense. Idk why they changed it.
Nice first Trin and now Dylan watches Hannah montana too
Damn you should've watched the episode before when she tells the world she's hannah montana. But still love the vid 😁
first trin and now him - WHATS WITH THE HANNAH MONTANA CONTENT KEEP IT COMINGGG
Im sure if you asked pretty much every famous person if they could just put on a wig and that's the only time people recognize them, they would sign up SO quick lol. I think you underestimate how hard it can be and how much they want to be anonymous at the snap of their fingers and go out and do stuff without getting mobbed.
"Dead mom? YESSS!"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 killed me
ALWAYS 22
honestly, the episode where Miley is "exposed" and has to make the decision to come clean to everyone is for me the ending. it was perfectly sad and hopeful and nostalgic
At this point my main source of serotonin is absorbed through whichever way Dylan chooses to introduce his sponsor every video
I'll definitely say it's not for everyone and not the BEST show ever for kids, but it's like one of the first shows of Disney which was original. it was so fun to watch back then and growing up with h them, And yes you absolutely ruined it for me😂, the jokes didn't land at all, watching this as an adult🙊
Don’t worry Jason Earles was like 33 while filming the show so🤷🏾‍♂️…and that’s what happens when you comment before watching the video😂🤣
I loved this show so much 😂😂
i’m 24, and i still watch this show religiously. the nostalgia makes me miss my childhood. kinda sad dylan didn’t see the whole jake and jesse situation.. team jesse all the way! 🖤
i’m just upset dylan won’t get to judge the whole jessie jake triangle
dylan always has the best timing for his videos and they never fall to make me laugh
Someone needs to make a compilation of Dylan’s perfect ad transitions
Dylan laughing at his own build ups to the sponsor of the video is what i live for
4:45 if Nickelodeon made this show that is exactly how they would’ve found out 🤣
No one commented on it yet but its not the same house in s4, there's a whole thing in s3 where they have to move to a house with ranch so she could take care of her horse or something. Also Lilly moves in with them
dylan now you gotta watch a hannah montana movie!!!
I need to say it, when I was a kid, I thought Hannah Montana was based on a real story. I read a synopsis of the show in a magazine about nature (as an ad) and just thought it was real. But I didn't think Miley was the real Hannah, I thought the real Hannah was probably annoyed that Miley was giving conserts in her name?
hannah montana was great and all but i always loved wizards of waverly place more
Never liked the show... maybe I was a little bit too old, but I found it cringy af
DYLANNNNN! You need to watch the movie way better then this I would love to watch you watch it!
what's iconic about hannah montana is the music and concerts. the plotline... not so much 😭
19:46 I laughed way harder at this than I thought I would XD
So, I know Dylan likes anime and I wonder if he’s seen Peach girl? This is not a recommendation, however I am curious. Have any troublemakers seen it?
I'm glad Jackson got a job as a karate sensei later on
Dylan, have you watched Hannah Montana the movie? We need a movie commentary please. Cant wait to see you mimic the accents lol
Yeah I think the kiss thing might have been a meta thing. I might be wrong but IIRC Disney only allowed them to do one kiss per season or something like that.
You should do "Wizards of Waverly Place" next.
didn't really like it when i was a kid, and i still don't like it now LMAO
Not Fannah Montana 😭
i've never seen a youtuber getting into an ad read as happy as dylan i swear to god he gets me everytime lmao
9:36 the was she just disappears LMAO that shot is funnier than any comedy I've watched and it wasn't even intentional
You should watch wizards of waverly place it's iconic
r u 30? :o
You should watch hannah montana the movie.
I haven't begun the video yet but if he says a single bad thing I'm unsubscribing
Yes I lov u
10 Things I Hate About You plssss Fan from India ❤
Nooo i remember this being so good..😭
I want him to watch the He Could Be The One special now
do yellowstone‼️‼️‼️
I would say cringe but i just binged the whole series and im over 30
Oo do more episode
DYLAN YES
Listen, do I agree with all your criticisms? Yes. Do I still love Hannah Montana? Also yes. Now I wanna rewatch it all again 😂
Trin, now Dylan...😏 I like that.
Lool when I saw your caption I was like “no freaking way!!” I’ve been bingeing this for the past 3 days🤣🤣 I’m 24 by the way but I always go back to Hannah Montana, Suite Life, That’s so Raven ..all of them 😂
The loud girl is in Young and Hungry if you wanna react to it … 🧍🏾‍♀️
I think the guy who laughed at the ketchup joke was in Drake and josh 's laugh track.
Dylan you never disappoint and I appreciate you for it! 😂😂
I think one of the reasons why Season 4 feels flat is because Miley was in a hurry to end the show. Guess this was during the Can't Be Tamed era. Hannah Montana Season 2 was the best, the episodes were funny, and the music was so good. I guess the last season was the last season where Disney could "tame" Miley hence the lame jokes. Have you seen the Hannah Montana Movie too Dylan?
You should watch k.c undercover
Well now I NEED Wizards of Waverley Place
You should watch wizards of waverly place, is probably the best disney sitcoms of all time
It is incredible how poorly this aged for me compared to some other disney channel stuff. I feel like I could legitimately still enjoy High School Musical, The Cheetah Girls, Wizards of Waverly Place, that's so Raven, maybe even more. But this was actually difficult to watch even with all the editing. I will say, the movie they made (Hannah Montana movie) was leaps an bounds above the show. It's amazing what you can produce with a legit budget.
“He’s got to be Corbin green or something” 🤣
you have to watch the Hannah Montana movie now
Trin and Dylan out here feeding us well with the Hannah Montana content, we stan
Regarding what you're saying towards the end about wanting to like the show etc., I think a lot of the appeal of Hannah Montana today is the nostalgia, but the writing and the acting haven't really aged well. I've rewatched a few episodes of different 'classic' Disney shows when Disney+ launched, and other shows have aged way better with some of the humour still landing years later, but I've found that HM is not one of them.
can’t believe he missed the whole jessie vs jake conflict, I feel like he would’ve had so many good jokes
I was more of a Wizards of Waverly Place kid; I watched all of those shows, but now that I’m 24 I have no interest in watching those shows again because they’re for kids and after watching this I know that to be true 😂
Hannah montana was my show, I had the wigs, the outfits, the songs was such a bop. He could be the one is my favorite
honestly, i don’t think anyone who loves hannah montana thinks it’s peak cinema. it’s just really over the top childish humor and that’s what a lot of people love about these old disney shows.
WATCH THE MOVIE THAT ONE IS SO MUCH BETTER
I was literally rewatching the love island series wow I'm pyschic.
Dylan's reactions to the transition musics gets me every time lol
I used to find Hannah Montana HILARIOUS when I was 12 but now.. 💀
Dylan getting immediately triggered when literally any show/movie mentions college is adding years to my life! 🤣🤣
This is not how I remember the show 😂😂
I definitely think at the time when Hannah Montana was on it was special. like waiting to find out what happened in the next episode. there were some fun episodes (Jonas Brothers episodes, the episodes Selena Gomez was on, the crossovers they did with suite life of zack and cody) it was just what it needed to be at the right time.
I remember recommending the hannah Montana movie to Dylan when he'd just started doing movie commentaries years ago... I've come full circle now (even though this is just the show lol)
I stayed up till midnight to watch Hannah Montana everynight  when i was little ….tho it still have a place in my heart  I am questioning  why i did that now rewatching … maybe its about english they sound much more annoying when i watch it in English
Dylan talking about that guy laughing at the second to the last seat, i hate how specific that was because it's the same thing i thought😭
Happy monday u guyss!!!!! 💗
Generally from the typical Disnay kid shows I feel like Hannah Montana rly aged the worst....most of the plot and jokes are just meh. I rememebt that even as a kid this was one of my least favorite so I guess they rly did sth wrong.
Can you react to Turning Red, please.
Missed chance to watch the episode where Miley’s Grandmother fights Dolly Parton over Elvis Presley😔🤘🏻
hannah montana does not hold up 😭
Damn this show was my entire childhood but its kinda lame now looking back at it
4:46 Dylan they wouldn't do that joke on Disney Channel, that's a Nickelodeon joke
I was just binge watching your videos.
Who came here after Trim's video??😂 Seems like these two are in cahoots. We're going to need a Collab eventually.
I can't say how fast I clicked on this video
Season one of Hannah Montana was fun in my opinion. The show was never great, but I feel like it lost its charm in later seasons
Hannah Montana: The Movie though...fire.
Eyyy the first time I’ve been so early 😂
What a great treat to wake up to on Saturday 🥲
I forgot how much Emily screamed all her lines. Much like Kaley Cuoco in Charmed.
Omg finnaly. I had a date yesterday. So there wasn’t a date. I’m a single mom and once a month I have a night free. My kiddo sleeps at my parents. I don’t go out at all. But with that dude I really wanted. But the dude ghosted me. I’m pretty down the whole time. But Dylan is here to save my day. Dylan AND Hannah Montana kn one video? I’m blessed. I always look forward to his videos.  My life is pretty…lacking love. The past 5 years. It’s even sader than it sounds. But Dylan’s videos…always cheer me up. I rewatch them so often. Thanks troublemakers and thanks old man with a nose ring 🥰 (I’m old as well. So it’s fine of me saying this)
Thank you Dylan, I’m blessed with this video.
DYLAN
22:53
⭐️Miley did an SNL skit about a Disney Channel Acting School. I kept thinking about it when you mentioned the way they yell every line! 😂
Miley looks so small
no way, I was just thinking when's the next video but then you posted lol
The movie is really good. Or from what I can remember from like 7 years ago, but yo know yeah…
This is the the first  first and lasst where I've seen the whole show
I'm new here 🥳 I really love watching your reactions , I've been watching all the others and it's fun. Would like you to react to dhar Mann videos it will be so🔥lit
I will never get tired of Dylan laughing at his own ad transitions 😂
Can’t  believe he didn’t recognize Jenna from PLL at around 20:00
Dylan uploaded and the week is saved
10:52  that was smooth, Dylan
I’m still a wizards of Waverly place bigger fan than Hannah
Dylan watched 4 episodes in one video!!! what the actual fuck !?!?!
"Dead mom YESSS" Ayo bruh I can't with you 💀💀💀 The only YouTuber that wants violence/death in Disney movies lmao. You made me choke on my coke mixed with iron brew.
All Dylan's talk about "why wouldn't Miley want to be known as Hannah Montana for the fame" talk reminds me of how in JONAS it's literally just the JONAS Brothers whilst they go to school and are also famous.
I would love to see Dylan is in trouble reacting to Sonic the hedgehog 2 that was just released
i was wondering where you were
the video we didn't want, but the video we NEEDED
DYALNNN THIS IS THE BEST NOTIFICATION I COULD GET 🥰
Dylaaaaannn !!!
not dylan saying the line was too wordy. sir that is the iconic longest say what in hannah montana
YES????!! OMFG
Wait!!!! Dylan's  30.  Did anyone else not know this
Why does Dylan look hotter as he ages … Dylan if you’re reading this don’t let it blow up your ego… you went to a fake college 🤷‍♀️
This should be a series , wizards of waverly place would be a great next choice 👀👀
Dylan is more dedicated to keeping his nose ring on than his college was to staying open
See you again next month 😭
The evil cackle when Dylan segued himself into a Honey sponsor
Is dylan wearing a scouting sweater?!?!?!
Dylan really went on for a minute describing how Hannah Montana relates to Scarface
OMG DYLANN. this my ramadan gift I presume? will thanks. i wanna let you know that eid is coming soon so i expect another gift, and that will be another commentary video on a disney show.
I would love to see you react to BTS (not necessarily their music, I'm talking their funny videos and all!)
I can’t wait to see Dylan play Flynn Rider in the live action Tangled, nose ring and all.
I think you would like Wizards of Waverly Place's comedy style more
DYLAN PLEASE DO MORE DISNEY OR NICK SHOWS FROM THE EARLY 2000s I love this!!!
I don't know how you do it but your videos always come at the exact right time! :)  I'm so tired today and wanted a comfort watch tonight and was thinking about watching the Hannah Montana movie. Then I open YouTube and see this!!
yay i missed you!!
didn’t he pull a muscle in his tongue in the hes all that video and now he pulled a muscle in his throat lmao
dang i guess dylan is still going through that college trauma
🤣I look forward to seeing what the segway is every video
Why is the idea of an adult counterpart to a kids show actually genius. Like the kids show focuses on the kids and we hear mom say "sorry im just stressed from work" but the adult show shows shes having an affair with her boss?!?! Dude id watch it so much
I love the colors in the background (it's the Armenian flag colors) lol.
Dylan, your laugh when you introduced the honey sponsor was just at the same level that the ketchup joke guy
Can someone research if this is the first onscreen appearance of a simp
I love Dylan’s laugh so much. 😆
*mix it all together and you that is the best of both worlds*        *HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA*
Wizards of Waverly Place next please! Its gold!
I laughed way too hard at the honey ad insert...
i screamed when u uploaded lol - thanks for curing my depression
I WAS JUST THINKING THAT YOU SHOULD DO THIS MOVIE.
Ahhh this has literally made my day !!  I’ve got my year 12 Alevels exams coming up and have been busy doing economics, psychology and business revision and now I have an excuse to procrastinate so thank you 😭😭😭♥️♥️ !
Hi:)
dylan’s laugh ❤️
honestly have no recollection of hannah montanna since i watched it when i was really young😭 all kinda feels like a fever dream but still best show disney had to offer
"You're too old for a nose ring" I'm turning 30 next month and I have a nose piercing and a septum ring lmao
Let’s all hope Dylan doesn’t actually go punch a Disney executive, cuz then he’ll never get cast as Flynn Rider
This is awesome and super funny! Missed this series:)
No one is paying more mind to Dylan's nose ring than Dylan
Bro Loki love your vids they make me laugh so hard
damn i forgot today was monday
Dylan loving the one audience members laugh is the greatest thing
Freaking the frick outtttttttt!!!!!!!!!
Dylan not missing out on a "that's what she said joke" even while choking is the kind of commitment I signed up for🤣
Just me who has never liked Lily
My childhood 😭
Dylan! Where's the JOIN button?? 😁😊
You should definitely watch the movie !!!
DADDY DYLANS BACK
Dylaaaaaaaan u uploaded!!!
i don’t think dylan understands that his entire fan base is basically just girls who yell like lilly whenever he posts
Tall Girl Commentary: “That’s how you defeat bullying, is by more bullying.”  This video, 2 years later: “The only way to defeat bullying is with more bullying.”  *Nothing’s changed* 😊
Please watch hill house pleassseeee
I MISSED YOU
So Funny
2:23 MY EXACT REACTION LMAOOOOO
OH IM EXITED AS SHIT
Daddy Dylan is back 🥰
This is one of the best thing I've ever watched! 😂
dylan laughing at the audience member that won't stop laughing😭
😍
I’m 19 about to turn 20 and I still watch this show
Ok but then you need to watch the movie next 😂
earliest i’ve ever been
Since Dylan hates girl meets world so much, i would like to see how he reacts( hates) it lmao
Love your videos Dylan!!
Bestie that laugh has been in the same laugh track for every show for YEARS😭😭😭
“Dylan Is In Trouble” is a funny YouTube channel.
take a shot every time Dylan mentions his college was a scam
10 mins? damn am i early
I'm doing my spring cleaning... I feel like I need a break
This is what we’ve been waiting for. 💕😁
NEW SHIRT?!??!?!
I miss Disney OG movies more than Disney OG tv shows.
Phantom Montana
thanks for this
the best notification that I can get is that of a new video of dylan :,)
Bro I missed you 🥲
YEYYY HE POSTED!!!
Missed you :)
The Scarface theory 😭
one of the cons of living in a whole ass other country is that his videos come out at 4am 🥲
Dylan, you're like 30. Please stop acting like an ancient relic 😂
perfect timing! now i don't have to do math homework for half an hour 😅
WATCH SONNY WITH A CHANCE TOO DEMI LOVATO IS THE MAIN CHARACTER
I miss you
Miss ya!!! Good episode! 🥰
I am not American so I actually believed you there in the intro for a second, I was all invested and shit lol
IM SCREAMING YESSSS THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FORRRRRRR
Dylan imitating Lily is so chaotic
Nah, I don't believe you're like that... You're basically female gaze. At least what we get to see
"WHY WOULD I HATE HIM, HE REMINDS ME OF ME" LMFAOOOO
So we're coping trin now huh
I needed this!! 😄
Yeah.. no but yeah *sniffs*
love your commentaries, they always make my day
5MINS!!! HOW EARLY ARE WEEEE?!?!
My two loves
I haven't started that I am scared. I won't survive Dylan hating hard on hannah
Yes!! I'm so happy you posted! 😄
I can't believe that Jason Earles was already 29 playing 16 year old Jackson at the beginning of the show. He looked so convincing, that I was surprised when I found out his true age!
hi I want to say that my birthday is coming up so can you watch the movie one week apart it's on Netflix that will fulfill my wish thanks 😊   it's cringey
for the first time??? i am disgusted.
I MISSED YOU DYLAN😭
I never clicked on a notification this fast 😂

I'VE NEVER CLICKED ON A VIDEO ANY FASTER!! THIS IS ICONIC 🥺✨✨

oh yes scarface's spinoff one of my favorite shows as a kid
You basically grew up with this show. You are never too old to watch it. You had to be at least 14-15 when it came out
its so cringy but we loved it
I love youu Dylan
This is not the video we need. It’s the video we deserve
Yes Kingggg welcome to pop culture😭
omg a early birthday present!!! I'm so excited
YES I NEEDED THIS
you and trin are soulmates confirmed
No listen cause Hannah Montana produced bops!!!
Truth be told, Ice never really watched either 💀
you guys think he’ll notice jackson’s actor being like 34?😭
Never clicked faster on Dylan's new video
as someone who never watched hannah montana, this seems legit
I just..... watched the first episode
been binging your videos for the past two weeks and have probably watched over 100, but this is the first time i'm watching a video right as it was uploaded
Yes.
I adore being early
YOU GET THE LIMO OUT FRONT _OOAOO_
IM SO HAPPPYYYYYY YOU UPLOADED A VID
i must say this is the top tier content i originally signed up for 🦕
He needs to watch Hannah Montana the movie
“HONEY, DYLAN JUST POSTED A NEW VIDEO” “ *HE DID!?!* IM ON MY *WAYYYY* ”
hannah montana was SO iconic, no one could've done better than miley cyrus
How are you living in thus century and never watched hannah montana before???
Dylan i missed you!
Does he ever says hi in the comments? 🥺
hannah montana was iconic, it was definitely worth the whole series when i was a kid
No cause I NEED this after Coachella.
dylaaaaaan!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭. this is the video i've been waiting for!!!!!!!
I’ve been waiting my whole life for this
I'm already laughing waiting for your kind ✨judgement✨
I love how trin did a Hannah Montana related video 2 days ago and now Dylan's here with a HM video too. Life is good
You AND trin watching Hannah Montana this week omg
OMG THIS IS THE MOMENT I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR AND I DIDN’T KNOW IT!😂😂😂
first trin now dylan yes i love it here
YES
I've noticed that I'll get push notifications for your channel but when I'm on YouTube, they don't come up. I wasn't sure if you were aware, but gotta let a Troublemaker know!
A video I didn’t know I needed!!! 😱🙌💙
You and Oz media definitely share the same hibernation cycles don't you?
I live for drug mule Hannah Montana.
Saw this notification pop-up while I was driving. When I saw the title I literally had to pull my car over to watch this 🤣🤣  Here we fucking go!
Omg whaaaaat I can'tttt 😂
I've never been this fast for anything in my entire life😌
Aint no way Dylan never watched Hannah Montana in his life
the way i clicked this notification so fast
YES !!! LOVE THIS SERIES ! Video just started and i know it will be hilarious from beginning to end
The way I JUMPED from the notification
Love you Dylan. I honestly think of you as my friend even though we don't know each other.😂
This is the best birthday present thank you dylan
J
A random comment
First Trin now Dylan yessss
I never knew this was something I needed until now
I needed to smile today, and nobody makes me smile like you :D
WHERES THE NOSE RING???.??
I'm so freaking excited for this, you're my favorite movie commentary creator and Hannah Montana was my childhood. Also I think you would love rico in the earlier seasons, he's just an evil little shithead and pretty much all he does is try to ruin Jackson's life
It’s never too late to watch Hannah Montana
I turn 30 this year 😭😭 I remember when it premiered. I was moving on the day. I remember being excited 😂😂 I also have a nose ring! 😂
hi :) so excited to watch this
OH MY GOD I'M CRYING 😭
I just can't get over how you've never seen Hannah Montana
Literally been checking his page every day for the past three weeks praying for a new video.
hannah montana is a top 10 show for a 2000s kids childhood
This is just what I needed! Was binge watching your old videos and now you just uploaded this one you couldn’t have better timing thank you!
