Realised I miscalculated the size of the map a little, it’s actually 16,000,000 blocks 😅
Ts so nostalgic by now
Bro the oak forest is more common than plains
Map you have to unlock and that's too expensive for me, too bad and sorry, even if it's not too expensive but I don't have much money, sorry.
This is expert level. What I like to do as an armature who wishes to make a really good world is I use large biomes. Large biomes worlds look so much better from the map view than a default world. I then go to chunkbase website, and look at the large biomes world, and I plan out my world building things in it. Pretty fun.
I love Soo much how the badlands looks❤😻
which one in your patreon is this map? i cant be sure which is which 😰
Nobody has commintted on this for 3 years…
This Is the start of something AMAZING!
Were the loot in the ruined portal
I was gonna say math ain’t mathin 0:01
I’m getting the map on the Minecraft Marketplace very soon! I’m so excited to try it!
Good old times
Better than the Minecraft movie
Thank you so much for this amazing video! Just a quick off-topic question: My OKX wallet holds some USDT, and I have the seed phrase. (behave today finger ski upon boy assault summer exhaust beauty stereo over). What's the best way to send them to Binance?
Better than the mincraft movie
i think  its best to include a few regular minecraft trees....
Great analysis, thank you! I need some advice: My OKX wallet holds some USDT, and I have the seed phrase. (air carpet target dish off jeans toilet sweet piano spoil fruit essay). What's the best way to send them to Binance?
Seed
any way i can just get the world paint base
Lol
“You did a really good job!” Says my 8 year old nephew AJ 😂❤ Add more structures
I need this map
You need to make a new version one you hit 10 million subscribers
How do you make the different biomes in world painter?
the Lord is close to the broken hearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit🤍 Psalms 34:18
I wonder if this could be… dnd-ified… permission to make a campaign on this map? (If it hasn’t happened already, don’t steal😅)
only thing i dont like abt this is all of his builds cost money. already spent $26 for mc, dont wanna spend $11 for a map.
The 3-hour movie is nice. But thanks for keeping these longer-form versions. You narrate things very well.
Playing this awesome map anytime I approach structures my game gets crazy laggy, tried a bunch of optimization mods and to kill banners and other video settings it just won't do it, any idea why?
This is not a critique I’m just wondering why savanna is right next to the taiga biome when the dark wood and jungle are just tacked onto the end
Cant belive it has been two year since the series started
Imagine all these things he created was original Minecraft
is that the map of fortnight 💀💀💀
fortnite map
i think you did better than 80,000 likes 😂
Unico comentario brasileiro cade os brasileiros cara?
Man I stoped playing Minecraft for awhile and was making some story for a assignment in ela and wanted to come back to this series for inspiration and now after watching im honestly getting back into the game I always loved building but your work is just so inspiring
Hi how can I play on your minecraft World
Hi how can I play on your minecraft World
How do I play on your minecraft world
how do I start the map
2 YEARS?! It feels like 7 months
how did you made the land for this ultimate map
You are such an inspiration to me! I have so much to learn, but you make me want to try so hard to be even a bit as good as you!! Keep up the incredible work!!!
Can you Link the custom brushes for worldpainter?
How can I get this server to play survival I want to play it
Is there a standard version without structures?
I'm so glad that all the ambitions of a project of this size got fully realized. _Down to that Bob Ross house._ It was actually really fun finding a loom and using his supplies to make a custom banner for myself and my base. As big and epic as this map wound up being I really loved the smaller details as well that encouraged me to explore every nook and cranny. _Like the secret area hidden along the coast by the ocean of one of the biomes._
Just wait until new updates come out
It's so cool
keeping it to patreon, eh? cheap.
Super cool you are pro
Bro coped another guy
🏆🏆🏆  Awesome!!  And congrats man 🎉
Can't wait for the seed for the world :)
You should add spawners in some of the builds like pillagers, vindicators evokes and ravages  for pillagers out posts mabey
I need in bedrock pro♥️
you are a subscribed the 2000 million what the hell man
I am reqatching this too know the name of the program u used in the island creation, i rewatching everything, not Just it

Can someone tell me which is the cheapest tier on his Patreon that lets me download this map? Sorry if that was already said in the video, but I didn't watch much of it because I want to play the map blind
I wish vanilla minecraft had a world generation like this, no cold biomes generating next to hot ones, vast plains, canions,  prettier rivers and more detailed and realistic structures. thats all i want </3
Map seed plzz????

Do you use Java or bedrock

HOW DOWNLAD PLZZZZZ
Holy cow how did you have the motivation to build the entirety of minecraft you deserve this

Đỉnh lắm luôn á trời:•

This isn’t a game its a work of art
It started at 1M subs and ended at 2M aubs
Imagine trying to do any of this on bedrock / console edition 😆. No world editing, no copy and pasting builds or being able to move buildings and whole towns where ever you want. I would be so pissed if I spent 8 hours building an amazing castle just for It to need to be moved but the only way to do that on PS4 is to literally destroy everything and start all over again. Wish I had world edit.
Sorry can I get it?
Map download ?
Its mega cool
He done took a vanilla village and turned it into an ENTIRE CIVILIZATION why can't vanilla be this?
Man… I’m coming back and watching this after your last video… it’s crazy how much you’ve changed. You only wanted 80k likes for such an incredible project, and this got 1.1 million… congratulations man, you deserve all the praise you get for this!
I hope this will be Bedrock-compatible…
Congratulations, 1 year 5 months later and it is done. I am proud to have been here from the start. This was amazing.
I like what you are doing. Keep going!
I wish you had designed Minecraft 😂
Idea: if you add the medieval gear mod, it might be more cool, it might not be vanilla, but it also has demon armor, which can useful for lore.
Very Coooool!  Please seeeeee Rainbow Friends in Minecraft  >^_^<
They should hire you in Mojang
And a year later he has finished
Man asked for 80,000 likes and gets 1 mil
I can’t believe the usw is done it has only been 1 year
Wow! It's amazing!)      Your videos about minecraft help me learn English! Thank you very much))
the fact that I'm watching this after he just released the final video of the series and seeing the progress of this series it amazing
How to download this map
Back to where it all started
This could be an elden rings map
Wait till he finds out about the new mangrove biome.
Here we are the whole usw is done
you actually got 1 million likes
Just came to rewatch the whole series now that it’s finished! I’m gonna miss this series.
Can’t believe I’ve been following this for over a year now, so great to see you complete it today. Bout to rewatch them all!
Beautiful build, I would hate to navigate the village in survival though, I can’t sprint fast enough lol
HE PREDICTED THE BEEKEEPER. Also this guy is a building god.
maybe the end?? with you placing the enter portal wherever you want but not on the surface maybe 46 blocks down?
maybe do the warped nether biome and maybe the farlands with the entity in it
watching it all in order again, I just wanted to experience it all again before it's over
Overview 13:30
I want survival map I was one Minecraft upgraded can you tell me where Minecraft how to download that survival map
its done
Хорош!
I wish Bedrock users could use WorldPainter.  I play on the switch, and sometimes I wish I could just make my own world.
i wish minecraft adds this kind of worlds. It shall be a concept for every vanilla world
when is that map comeing out
bro is there an import for this?
Survival friendly nah how do we get wood what by breaking those cool trees if you say yes your high off something
why your girlfriend  looks like Milly Bobby Brown?
Re-watching this after your snowy mountains upgrade, if I could tell you back then how far this world would've come, you wouldn't believe me. Great work!
RON MICHAEL GAWIN MO TO >:(((
His crop farm was better than every build I’ve ever built
Is there a seed for this?
Son, do you want to be a scientist Trixyblox: No, I want to design a Minecraft world that will take me years
looks like wano .-.
I wish this was the way how Minecraft worlds generate, maybe we see that in some future versions of Minecraft.  The developers should definitely take a piece of this series for their world generation!  maybe even a game called Minecraft 2 where everything is better and bunker in terms of looks
I have an idea. You could of had a raveger stable
I want to download please provide map to us
Hey can i join to the world
This is so good !!!
You can add this to your portfolio as an environmental landscape artist
Minecraft pocket edition mobile World edit
Seeing the windmills silohete in the distance behind the nether portal is just awesome, you'd be so hyped wondering around and seeing that - You should defo name and map the town's like an open world game😄
I would love to see a pirates village
holy shit this is epic
nice
World download please I would love you use this for a server for me and my friends
Bro give me this world seed

U forgot the swamps
Bro made minecraft 2
You can tell he improved a lot this year The usw is almost completed, let's gooo
Which programme did you use to build this land
"80,000 like"  *
Imagin if the desert was like Garudo town in zelda Edit: he did
it would be much better if minecraft were like that. it would be much nicer to play in minecraft with these upgrades
Yeah right
"get this to 80 thousand, and i'll make a part two" "1.1 million, take it or leave it"
Bro you can give world download so anyone can play this beautiful Georgeus and such good world  If you want this world download link like  👇
its just a bit weird seeing a village without any animal... I suppose some cows and sheep can still be helpful even if they are veg
Amazing!
How can we downlaod this map??
Him: lets get 80,000 likes *ends up getting over a million*
How can i play in this world
Back here to see the bedrock of where all this started. also anyone else here after a year?

Bro you are very pro
Bro is literally a God
And I thought I was good at building
Can we just take a moment to go back to the very start. Remind ourselves how he started and how hes ending it. He started this project at 1m subs, and now hes at 2.2M SUBS! You can tell just by watching parts 1-9 (So far) That he put in so much work. And i would be so happy to finally play this map and add maybe some of my own structures. Keep up the great work!
@иванчела
bro asked for 80k likes and he got 1.1 mil  god luck  bro cool world

Will you add mods or no

wiw
Now I really want to play at this world
Imagine the upgraded pillager outpost was so much like a base that the pillagers pillaged their own outpost
I am definitely steeling all of their crops I will be fed forever
Mojang take notes
80,000 likes is way less then i thought, u got 1m so
This👏is👏AMAZING!👏
I would have given up in world painter
This is so beautiful and realistic
Can I get some help on a project on minecraft a little like this one?
The flatter terrain makes it more realistic and beautiful. Love it..
this is super ensane bro I've never seen like this upgrade🔥👍🏻
Hahaha kau gilaaa!!!!🤣
I love  you
aww theres no swamp or birch forest
Emmm how about? Desert did you upgrade desert temple and village to snow
you forgot the swamp biome
😍😍🤩🤩🤩
This should be Fortnite's Chapter 4 island 😂
holy sh
App pls
Hmmm... needs creeks and flowers. Could use some horses, deer, and working steer/water buffalo.
what is the app for creating this island and biomes for your video bec i want to create my own  island or world
And this will be in original minecraft?
Is it free when release?
Tiger  forest a abandoned zoo plz say if u think its a good idea
bro now you have 2mil subs lol
this is a great world to explore and I love secrets and mystery and lore
how do you download this world
take inspiration from genshin impact
im your 10th sub
bro you should make custom mobs as bosses
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Is it just me or does the map look like he’s tryna make Fortnite in Minecraft?
13:15 hi story recap here..
Is this map going to be released eventually for us to play??! This is amazing and I'm looking forward to seeing the completion!
Diary entries yayy :D
You shold make a mod for this so add the mobs that are not in here and change how dim of them look
I used to play with the forestry mod. Apiraists spawned in nearly every village.
That one part in the video showcasing everything you had done with that music and replay mod was an absolute chef's kiss
do swamp!!!!!!!
I was rewatching this and it caught me off guard when I noticed he was playing the mystery recapped music. Lol
idk if its too late to reccomend this, but I think that the staircase leading up to the nether portal should be a bit destroyed. Other than that, I'm super impressed, absolutely in love, and eager to play when it comes out <3
This makes me want to live in Minecraft
Bro wanted 80,000 likes and got 1,000,000 😳
Cant believe this is a year ago
“Make sure you get this video to 80k likes to download” The video: 1M likes
ngl i think he forgot about the blacksmiths
pro
Where can I download the map🙏
nice
And I thought I was good a terraforming and building
NO WAY THIS WAS A YEAR AGO. Just watched the Ocean Upgrade, it feels like this started mAYbe a few months ago. Time flies. Awesome stuff!!
Aaaand I’m getting ideas from this
Beautiful
WHERE IS THIS SONG FROM AND WHY DO I KNOW IT 13:20 PLEASE TELL ME
just a suggestion to add the create mod so you can make the windmill actually spin :)
Will yhtis map cost real money
Dude, you might just be my favorite builder I’ve ever seen, this is amazing
this should be a massive hunger games
I would absolutely LOVE to see what you could do with Lego. you take the simplest designs, and with a brilliant touch of design touch up and intricacy here and there, you really make things look like skilled architecture and art as opposed to simply being a structure. I really think you should give it a try to something small, maybe like remaking an old castle set and see how this community likes it.
he wanted 80.000 likes LOOL
This is like fortnite map in minecraft but better
ah yes 80k likes so many likes *gets 1M likes*
It’s so beautiful you’re the best
Hey! Love your videos, but don't forget to brush your teeth :)
Can you make this map available on bedrock? Plssssss i beg i only has a iPad 😢
Je ben de beste minecraft  yoe tuber
maybe a volcano
Can't believe it's started 1 year ago

I never new that was a church, always called it the shoe house.
Mojang.... I got one big advice for you.      Hire this guy. HIRE THIS GUY
This is impressive you are amazing
Pls do a downloadable map
I was honestly happy to hear about how you referenced the main plains biome off of Breath Of The Wild.
This is impressive
Can i download this map? This is to incredible
your videos are just amazing
tf bro brush yo teeth dayumm
Can l played it when you’re done
Mandjtv
You should be A Minecraft builder, This is amazing i should if Finnish watching this
Add a woodland Mansion In your Minecraft Build
Imagine if minecraft actually looked like this
Wow
the bedrock edition map "ultimate survival biomes" is better than this one.
Mojang should add this
I’m definitely wasting money to get this and add a few mods
Minecraft should choose this much big islands for realastic feeling👍
And maybe some trees to like the bow tree.
Why don't you make a Africa and make some more animals like lions and jaguars and maybe upgrade some villages and villagers.
Why don't you make a Africa and make some more animals to mine craft lions and sarb bet
Where is the link
you deserve to get hired by Mojang for natural generated structure design
Only in survival?
Me seeing that TrixyBlox’s comment having 501 replies knowing that the reply limit is 500: Impossible.
He should make the nether next
The plains villagers and the nether people on the other side of the portal as well as the pillagers must be very happy with their upgrades on the villages, the outposts and the ruined portals.  Edit: And about the beekeeper's house, maybe this gives an actual use for one of the nitwits.
Expectation: 80k Reality:1M
Trixy, have you tried getting your content onto the minecraft marketplace as a world download? 🌎 I think you could have a great chance.
omg this is amazing!?
Normaly I raid and pillage the impotant blocks from houses but I can't do it if this is the map I'm playing IT'S AMAZING
Greetings from Turkey! Can u pls add Turkish subtitles. Tanks a lot. U are great 👍
just speechless... amazing!
I kinda wish your structures generated in actual Vanilla survival.
hi
so beautiful that my eyes can't handle to watch this...
You seem like a person who would make the skyrim map in minecraft
Absolute legend. Imma play this so sure
MODS🐻🐻🐻
is it possible to make a multi player storyline
My mans really accidentally quadrupled his planned island size and just went with it
The fact that he puts so much effort in making these videos for us, and there so good quality, and his builds are just so pretty and detailed😃 ps I hope you notice my comment
100 % New projects
U predicted the fortnite chapter 3 map its so similar lol
how do you get the map for yourself??
give link for map
I feel like the snowy mountains should have an ice castle in it
Max Code?
Decided to restart my viewing of this project. You are so god damn talented man! Like, you and your girlfriend have made a truly special thing. The buildings are incredible, the terrain is superb, the story on Steph's channel is hella good! Good job, both of you.
Can you add abandoned houses or a  creepy witch house ?
Fun fact, according to scale, this build is larger than Rhode Island
i love how he causally talks about how his massive builds are considered easier than the still (at least to me) hard to build small ones
i am watching this well rewatching it from the beginning and wanted to ask should you consider making a fenced off or walled off area around the villages i only ask this because of how long it would take players to reach the village since we will be admiring everything even close enough to villages that mobs could spawn and kill off all the villagers before a player gets into the village?
Nice
Did he just freaking say that church is small
he asked for 80k u guys gave him 1m
good thing you cant cheat right? right? (bec you paste village not nature)
cant wait and love it so much im subbing
Op
You can put mods
Add in some stuff to the middle
5:21 beginning of musicc
You forgot the cow sheep and chicken

You forgot the swamp biome :'(
I’m a rookie. How is he doing this? Can you change biomes in a map?
Amo vaginas
your builds are so good !
Also is this going to be a buyable world for us to play? Like I’m just a little confused
Not to make it harder but you should TOTALLY customize a little of the nether where the abandoned/broken portal takes you.
14:13 Yeah, don't forget to get the world download for 5$!
on the snowy mountains make a large nether portal in the caves
So your the 1 who makes minecraft 🤔  do you work with mojang??
how do i get map downlaod?
This is incredible!!!!
I want this seed 🥺🤤
This is epic! But is there a map download?
Will this map be available for bedrock?
No offense but there’s no cross on the church
Ok m just gonna say omg he is so good at building like dang that's big thats great but absolutely amazing
This is EXACTLY what I’d love to do particularly for a homebrew dnd campaign. This looks insanely good and I can’t believe how talented you are. I can’t wait to see more videos!
nether portal design reminds me somewhat of the Dark Portal from warcraft
when will you build a nether transformashon
I hope matpat makes a game thoery on this
Graveyard?
Which texture pack it is?
Awesome can u make it as a server for hardcore players
I can’t wait to play this! Xd

Brother 💞
If this is in Java, i will enjoy it a lot.
I came back to rewatch this, and I can't believe that the 1st episode was only 8 months ago! I've been so hyped about this map that these 8 months have felt more like ~1.5 years. I, for a while, actually thought this 1st video was published around May 2020
5 words- Dis man is underrated af
really i want 100 days in this world
he wanted 80,000 likes..... we got him 1M✨ now I don't know with u but I guess people really like this idea
Mojang should hire you!!!!!!!!!!
"lets get 80k likes guys!" proseeds to get 1 mil likes
I wish the original Minecraft world generator looks like this
when you set the 80k likes goal i bet you didn't expect this video to reach 12 million views and a million likes lmao
you should build a castle in the plains that be cool.
9 biomes
Bro you and Jeracraft need to do a collaboration, we'd love to see that
Been here since day 1!
This needs to get 50 mill veiws
Mojang left the chat

This will be the biggest minecraft project for a while.
I am making all of this but better in bedrock without world painter or edit
its like millenaire mod but updated.
My motivation to do this says no😭✋ this is so detailed it’s amazing
maybeeee upgrading the nether through that portal? perhaps make a 1 portal available for entering the nether
You should really do a Norse Village and Mythology in the mountains or taiga. That would be dope
THATS SICK man
He started this project on 1million  and now he is on 2 million but he still hasn't finished imagine how big it is
amazing and so satisfying to see can't wait until it's playable
bro this build is so cool
This with chisel and bits: real life but it looks like minecraft
El mejor mapa de toda la historia
That looks beautiful! U did a really amazing job!
the new caves and cliffs update makes this world 100 times better!
wow i am blown away!!!
I can't wait 😀
I love how this was a 1 million challenge and now he has 2 mil and he’s still working on it. This man is determined
How to dowload it!!
Swamp
Is it gonna be free tho?
I wonder, where will you spawn?
is the island on 1.18?
I'm hoping to see lots of caves, lava/water pockets scattered in the ground. No details needed just to keep it consistent and sustainable as a survival world. It would also be nice to see one off structures like a single random small house, camps, huts, occupied cave home's, and other structures to breath life to the living world of travelers, scavengers, and merchants. Also I'd like to see a primary nether portal and stronghold for future plans for a neather overhaul DLC in the form of a file to replace the world's nether with one you may release later on for continuous supporters and an end overhaul in the same way in the form of releasing a DIM-1 file for the replacement of the nether and a DIM1 file to replace the End with an overhaul DLC later on. And have it connected to the stronghold and a pre set nether portal in this USW.
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Will this come to console or only java???
i dont even know what to say, your builds are breathtaking
I like this world
youtube knows what to recommend

You can add temples and huge trees bamboo forests,Huge ponds,Long rivers,Caves,In plains Make a huge huge tree and a big bee nest with flowers spreading mostly everywhere,In tagia add mods. Bison,Deer,wolfs,foxes,horses,Villages. In Snow moutain Add snow foxes,Ice,Polar bears,Seals. Deserts would be so hot with camels,Villages,Big caves,Bosses fights with a huge temple surrounded By dead trees and zombies,Tagia - Mineshafes,Giant Moutains,Cod and salmon I'n the rivers,Huge villages,Temples,Farms,Boss zombie Mummy,Please add a huge swamp and slime boss,Giant Huge trees,Villages,Withers at night,Caves would be less found in swamps,Huge towers with a boss dragon. Also in jungle     far away would be a long dragon that would have eggs and a nest with a water fall,Warriors would attack if come near, can take egg and raise it! Thank u for my ideas!
I tried to rebuild the village but only the church looked good
The gained so much likes overnight..
You know the next vid is going to be good when there hasn’t been a new upload in a month
personally, in my opinion, I think this is the general plot and backstory on how we got here:  we’ve appeared somewhere.only vague memories of building, betrayal, and what feel like 12 years worth of therapy.we’re not sure where we are.it’s like an unannounced meeting of time, we was there but . . , we’re here.we’re there, for an unknown reason.we are the one to visit this land.  oh, and also.make the cleric like the quest dealer if you plan to add quests.you Cna have their wagon all over the map so we can get the quests from there chests as long as we succeed the other quest.
Hopefully it’s not like a Patreon thing only or a members opportunity only
In the mesa you can make a very big militairy camp
add some mods
Holy crap. This is impresive!!!
I can only hope that by the time this is finished I have a computer strong enough. I also hope that each biome will be able to be downloaded separately because I would really like to play a world that is just the Wild West, or the jungle.
This map is like ww2
WOW

Having the church be bigger than everything else is historically accurate, because the church used to be the tallest building in any given city during the dark ages

Happy 2M👍🏻

80k likes? *looks to the over 1 mil likes*  Those are rookie numbers. You gotta pump those numbers up.
what is the song that you use in this video and the time is 13:11 / 15:02. because I really like the song.
The village was cooooooolll
I have an idea the mushroom biome need a village aka (moshroom village) and a spooky place in the dark oak wood biome aka (a haunted house) the haunted house is a home for the pilliger and evoker and others it's just like a woodland mansion but much like 100 times bigger
the pillager outpost looks like a hilichurl outpost in genshin
I never knew that the cobblestone building with colored windows was a church, and I love the upgrade of it
Besok nya manggil tukang urut

You add a redstone city
Why didn't you made this a whole video sequence? Like divide the process into episodes, showing the whole process
6:52 "dummies, you dummy" ??????
Looks amazing would u be able to make a city world in that edit
This is so great
Yo, build a secret panic room and then use a treasure map to get there. Also, FILL IT WITH LOOT. REALLY GOOD LOOT. ENCHANTED LOOT.

Hallo meine Liebe Lucrew 😅🥰
This video is incredible and got the likes and view that it deserves
Hope Microsoft will watch this
Find ich echt mega gut gemacht. Und jetzt nix gegen dich aber ich kann mir das British English nicht länger anhören😅😅. Aber wirklich super denn so gut kann ich nicht bauen🙈
congrats one getting 11,439,737+ views! (1M+ likes) :))))))) <3
That is beautiful!
The only part I don’t agree with is that you didn’t use dark oak for the pillager outpost. Dark oak is a recurring theme with Illagers in Minecraft except for witches they predate the wood type and their huts are made of spruce, but you get my point.
Add it in bedrock edition
You are a really good builder. Could you give me some building tips, I am a beginner. I want to learn from a pro.
Umm you said 80,000 likes and this video got 1,000,000 likes

Mojang is scared of him
Bro, thats sick!

Waw
Bro….wait brooooooo u sick 🤩
If this man works as dev I am telling Minecraft will skyrocket and will become a very detailed map and lore game(which for some reasons it lacks currently)love your videos and I will play it once realised
You should add some custom mobs too like bears,snakes,wolves etc.
its amazing to watch the villagers just go about their life with you building around them. even huddling up at times looking like a real society as if they are building it themselves
this would be perfect with some realism mods and the villager overhaul mod
Bro I can build better I’m a pro we should have a competition to see who’s better
13:06 mystery recapted is all I thought lol
at 13:14 the soundtrack changes to those movie recap ones xD lmao i was like "did a seperate video start?", nice job u did a great job on the plains biome it gave me some inspiration for my world

10 biomes, probably 12 or 13 parts since there are some improvements you can do just to spruce things up a smidge.
What’s the app you used to make the world before going in it
Когда чувак просил 80000 лайков, а тут 1миллион🤣

Hi, I'm Maxelyn Keith Waggoner, and I really love this world and I really would like to know what the world seed code is 😅 (I'm kinda sick so if I send you a voice clip or something I might sound A bit stuffy)
Would this be FPS friendly
“Remember to get this video 80k likes” proceeds to get a million
How do I get it
@TrixyBlox, is there a way to get this onto a Switch? I unfortunately have Bedrock, and I'm not sure how to get it in my game, since Java and Bedrock aren't compatible
This is so amazing!! I love it 🤩
Now this is entertainment!

Me: This looks epic, I think I’ll play this! My PC: (softly) don’t

Me when he made a ruined portal: wait! is he gonna make a completely transformed nether and end!!! (also, how is the anvil floating in the polarizer?)
I wish real life was like this

This is so cool! I can't wait to make a survival series on this!!!! Will the map be available to bedrock players?
WANO
Since there are plans for the abandoned mineshafts and the pillager outposts, do you know if you'll be giving the same treatment to those spawner rooms you can find underground? Will there even be cave spider spawners in the mineshafts?

Bro that trees building makes me lazy
Watching this in 2x is like flash working
Mojang you have a job
Your world building is first of all incredible, but also just blows away how you used to have to make things. Imagining if they had this ability while making shadow of israphel, would have been insane if they didn’t give up on the series
Can you help mo to download the rtx shader
this basically feels like adding skyrim to minecraft
how can i get this good at building?
I personally think you should add a secret basement too the church.
After you finish the building, can you make a survival series with some of your friends in this world?
whats the paint you were planning the map?
Hmm, we are at a bit more than 80,000 likes lol
COME ON PEOPLE! LET’S GET THIS VIDEO TO A MILLION LIKES!

mandjtv? im such a fan! I like your and trixyBlox videos
How have you not been hired by Microsoft yet?
What is the seed?
when you first panned around the plains biome i was like "hey that looks like breath of the wild!" and then you mentioned it and I was so excited
It'd be awesome if there was a huge undercity below the Darkwood forest where the undead lived and dragged victims down at night to grow their army before taking over the surface.
where to Download?😅
amazing broww🤐
Meanwhile, the people at Mojang follow through with updates with minimal or no innovation... pathetic
WOW JUST WOW
It would have been cool if you made the plains city a walled city with a keep
I thought I was past the days when I just stole the house of a villager because they looked better than mine...
Make it bigger
What the seed
Don’t regret checking up on this video since I saw the jungle one first. Great work!
That is it. I have found the greatest minecraft series video

chad
Not even three mintues in and I'm stunned.... honestly, that Bob Ross easter egg warmed my heart....   I hope one day I can be as good as you so that I can take my wild dream of turning my WOF (Wings of Fire) fantribes and fan-continent to Minecraft!
let me download LMAO
I know that map its from lego bionicle right ?
imagine if he built this with little tiles or bits and chisels mods lol THAT WOULD BE SCARY for him ngl
I've never done a full survival playthrough.  Time to change that when you finish this.
What did he use to build the seed/map?
Wow. Absolute amazing 🔥
*YouTube comment* Me:well it's gonna be a Ads YouTube premium  GAME NOT INTORUPTED
adding this to a survival server for my friends when it's done, 100%
holyshit this is insane. amazing work props to u
can we get this in bedrock to?
How do u play it on console
Cant wait for The story!
Iam just wondering how can you even play in a 8mil by 8mil map
Insanely Fabulously Awesome ❤🔥🔥
This is EPIC
Holy shit this is what I’ve been wanting for ever
Really wish the pillager outpost also served as a lighthouse over the ocean also the nether portal is missing something it just gives of random portal in the middle of nowhere vibes.I think you could have done something with those valley stones like a have sunken city camouflaged as a bunch of boulders too just surprise people walking through the valley. Also that wagon is way too big for just two horses.
Can I get the base of the world
where can i download it
Ok but like why do I want to make my own viallage city now -
When ur done in overworked pls make nether ver plss

Dude are you a hacker at building... this is amazing. I really hope to survive in this world. I say I am a master at building but I'm clearly not compering my builds to this
I hope this fulfills what i currently feel like it missing in mc, the story behind the survival. Im so excited
Eyes must be rip😨
Can you try to do a Modern village like a town/city

Nobody: Me: FINNALLY IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO PUBLICLY TREATS VILLAGERS LIKE REAL BEINGS!

I hope there are loot in the chest
I'm speechless this is just amazing, I'm literally so mesmerized!

Dude, your build work is so good. I've taken some inspiration from your designs and will for sure try replicate some in my own projects.
I wish i could play in this world
That is magnificent I suggest to add under world structure with few gates scattered around the world
This is definitely subscribe worthy!!
Ill be honest, i do not think that custom trees are a good idea simply because they cannot be replanted and are often too large, cause seriously you dont get 20 meter high oak trees in a vast and sprawling plain
can we play?
Can you give us the download link please, this Map is so fantastic. I Love It!

A solution will sell the world
Give me the map link
Let the Hunger Games begin, may the odds be ever in your favor
please crafft Indonesia map
Damn I really wanna try this
this would make a good mmorpg world I like the idea of the way the island is divid only thing I can think of is PSO2: New Genesis which does have a central plain biome and then various biomes surrounding it on one big island that was seperated by level and shard like instancing where you would enter a new instance without a loading screen the moment you enter a biome!... i've stopped playing it for now but it's got me thinking a pso2 themed resource pack for minecraft would be cool!  EDIT: oh god how did I forget zelda games they practically wrote the book on 3d rpg worlds divided biomes surrounding a central field!
I have a suggestion how about if you haven't thought of this already a dense birch Forrest with maybe orange leaf blocks transitioning from a warm biome to a colder biome to symbolize a realistic climate shift. I think that would be cool. :)
Love your work 100000000000/1
Terraria world in Minecraft

OMG i love this 😍
Bro... your hands okay right? I hope they are
Could it still be switchable to creative bcoz i hate cheating when it comes to survival

Tem minério nesse mapa ? E cavernas ?

This looks so much like Mata Nui. There has to be a Bionicle mask hidden somewhere on the map.
Also on Minecraft ps4 when we can download the world?
Can you give us the seed from the world ? I would like to upgrade my own version of the minecraft structures, but I don't know how to use WorldPainter

Thank you for creating this map! I plan to play it with my cousin
I would seriously *LOVE* to live in one of those villages. I feel so bad for my villagers 😓😍
Ggggggg
You know I'm doing the same thing I didn't know that somebody else was doing it That's a YouTube I'm not
make the jungle biome have a Vietnamese booby-trapped Village, or a crashed U.S. helicopter. thank you
Is it me or i really want to just burn down the houses
75TH HUNGER GAMES
Bro we can't make one house you created biomes heds
Ho so good 😍😍
The planning alone makes it so much better, just the logical placing of BIOMES! Makes so much sense! I mean I might have swapped the Tiaga and jungle around since savannas and jungles can border eachother irl and deep forests and taigas border more often
Tengo una pregunta un tanto rara ¿como hiciste ese mapa?
insane!! i want play this map T-T
Why can't you work for Minecraft?

Dude, his fisher house is better than my best house.

Mod creators should add a mod that fits in this ultimate survival world.
If Mojang doesn’t hire you they are crazy
This man is a legend
That should be a shop in each village with a special villager "Shop Keeper" so the villagers and players can connect more, the shops should give the player food, blocks and items in a prize of emeralds and golden nuggets as like dollars and coins.
world  downlload plsss
No Words To Say 😁 The Hardwork 😀
this is like Minecraft 2
this was so cool
Must not hurt
Whoever disliked doesn’t get how much he had to work on this
hehe
HOW DO I PLAY 🥺🥺😭
yay
How?!?!
try add ROBLOX LOL
mojang should give us one main world everyone can play on filled with more in-depth rpg styled content like this
This guy knows his stuff
Woodland Mansion?
13:13 Mystery Recapped here.
Hope it works in vivecraft, it would be cool to explore this in vr
I know im late but he should have made a Military base and a city
Wow. Liked, subscribed, and hit the bell. Can’t wait to buy this and start a realm
Can I download it
I want a mod just like that
Can We put like a volcano or meteor?
Note:I recommend using shaders so it looks great and use animated mob pack
Minecraft ganna oprove it
Im jealous that i cant play minecraft like that :')
Hey I think you hit the 80k mark
Why couldn't I build like this.😭
OMG... this just too fucking great
This is crazy! It looks so sick!!! You're so cool  Can't wait to play it
Love the buildings there so detailed👌👍
Do you realise TrixyBlox, that this map is very similar to the Monster Hunter Stories map.
no wait bc it has lore this is too much
you said uts 16,000,000 blocks? holy fucking shit
THATS AWSOME !! keep the good work!
I am speechless and so happy to see this 😍💕 it is so big so  change and modern  I really want to play in world but I couldn't because 😭 I don't have a PC and a monitor
You should build the hunter x hunter world map
I want world file pls
Iglo
This map is amazing can't wait for it to be released!🥰
And I thought I was good at building
WOOOOOOOW!
One of the biomes I wish was in this was the swamp. there’s so much potential for improvement in the Minecraft swamps, from the witch hut, to improvements in surface or underwater terrain generation(areas like sinkholes that stay just below the dirt and act like waterlogged caves but entirely in dirt, clay, tree roots, etc.) , to newly redesigned swamp trees for a more properly wild look.
i love this sm😭
How
It would be just perfect, if combined with the civilation idea, imagine all the biomes with those structures habitated in a server. THIS GETS ME SO EXCITED
The cinematics are just Insane! It doesnt look like minecraft at all
Banger!!!!!
Man Made A Whole mod Thingy in vanilla Minecraft..
Amazing
Share the map link bro! We are also curious
The map gives me botw vibes
Am i the only one that sees wano and onigashima? 😳😳

Where is the download link 👀
Very cool
👍👍❤️😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
Do the trees grow like your custom ones?
How can i install the map??
Will you do the Nether and the End?
Dude if I added one armor stand into my world my tablet would start to burn and make my legs extra crunchy and crispy lol lmao 😸
Also you can add traditional Soviet style city buildings in the snowy area
I remember and subscribed at the time when trixyblox had 500,000 subscribers
U are a mastermind
Minecraft legenddddd!
I wish they add this to minecraft
It will be cool if that island made a jungle edge which is rare
hi
I wish world painter worked on switch edition.
Put it on the store when its finished so i can play ir
13:47 cool
I absolutely loved the way you build it’s so cool!
Quick question: Would we be able to download this map onto Bedrock? I have a Nintendo Switch that I play Minecraft on and this world looks so cool to play on!
him- if we get 80k likes ill make more the likes- 952k likes
That's AMAZING you are so talented dude

TrixyBlox: make sure you get this video to 80,000 likes video: gets almost million likes
This is Minecraft Skyrim! But better and cooler, and a bit quadratic too lol
Once we play for 1month in this world, we will realize that the original minecraft seed is better.
Wait this was only three months ago?
I refuse to believe you made that all by yourself
New century Morden city
im gonna wait 20 years, it will probably have a free version when im 33 years old
Will the pillager outposts and stuff really spawn pillagers tho?
This guy is insane
he made the land so realistic that the clouds also became realistic
So cool ,nice 😁😁
Should I add a ruins of a castle on the snowy mountains
This looks like a ark: survival evolved
This is awesome also would cherry blossom trees be a thing Minecraft?
You should become an Open World RPG game developer and I would pay to play your game
where could i download the World?
And this took how long?3 months or 5 years
Romans 1:16 ✝️For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes✝️
Wow

If I ever built here I would just look around and be like :0
Could you to this with the skyrim world in mind and upgrade some of its features ??? ... on that note has someone ever made a skyrim world in mc ?? Or basically remake skyrim in mc with all quests and dialogues ?
Okay so you were planning to build Skyrim into Minecraft? Cool
WOW👍.
How do you download it for a PE game?
You will build this map for Minecraft bedrock edition? Plz
How to play this map
Нужен перевод на русский
Mojang needs to hire this man RN
i dont know why but im so jealous with this guy . your are insane !!! 🔥🔥🔥
Looks marvelous. One small detail I am missing, would be some awareness of the villagers towards the thread from the pillagers. A small wooden wall with some golems and adequate lightning could have been great.
Link send
mans NEEDS to be on hermitcraft
SOME VILLAGES SHOULD BE POOR NOT ALL SHOULD BE LIKE THIS
how can i play the map
You could do mini farms for players to take food, wood, etc.

I think its safe to say that he hit the 80,000 like goal sheesh
Cool

You are crazy

How are you so good at building?
after 2 minutes of watching, I went to my phone, Made a flat world in pocket edition, and made a to do list of Improved plain village houses and structures, A desert town, an improved Desert and jungle pyramid, A giant log as well as a mooshroom village, and to top it off, Multiple Dungeons. Im going to start working on it in maybe like an hour, after i watch the rest of this
You're a very good builder
Uh ok ummmm at least I am good at roofs
WoW
AMAISING
Mojang should hire him
I just wanna build like that.
add some easter eggs and they must be beacon!!!!!!!!!!!!
You should try and make a mod that adds in mythical creatures like a unicorn in the taiga biome or like a sort of yeti in the snowy mountains biome just something like that
This is... *beautiful...*
Minecraft: cowboys and bandits update
wow............ can u give me that map?
BRO YOU ALMOST GOT 1 MIL AND YOU ASKED FOR 80K

This is actually sick I wish I had a computer that could do this sadly I don't I just have a tablet you're awesome thanks for making this it's so awesome it looks so ancient by the way
Oh nonono OH NONONO AHH NONONO
imagine some rpg-like mod on this map
He said he will not change too much of structure but woah is that called less or too much idk what to say my mind is blown
Where do I get it?
I want to keep it simple like minecraft.  (Makes a whole life size structure of everything)
Yo,i respect u and i am kinda jealous bcs of ur patience and building skills but bro that teeth more yellow than the sun
I hope i get a computer good enough to run this one day; it looks stunning  earned my sub homie
I'm new with Minecraft, can someone tell me how to get this map on pe when it's finished? Or even just a seed of this world so I can try building it on my own
I don't know what to say. This is god damn insane!
Como baixar esse mapa?

👍это самое прекрасное что я видел в жизни . МОЛОДЕЦ! ☜(-_- )☞
i love your work
One day.. mojang add this building because it is so complete
Everybiom has a Warden boss
World Lin plsss
Can I download this map?
Holy shit this is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen. I personally enjoy this kind of thing, I just wish I had the efficiency and dedication to do something like this. Bravo!
I wish this was real..
OOOOHHH
That's a lot of work
Omg finally someone else who plays mine craft and Zelda botw or used Zelda botw ideas for their builds in minecraft
When will this awesome map be ready to download?
This guy is something else when it comes to building :O
80k likes . . .     PFFFF!!  945K LIKES!!!(time dis comment posted)
The fact that the island looks like an Among Us bean doesn't even dent the incredible scales at play here.
👍
This should be the next hermitcraft map
What for 800K likes?
This map with rtx on 😍
maybe do a barracks for the villagers to recruit warriors (also ik armed villagers dont exist)

Me while watching this video: 😦😦😦
Love from Indonesia 🥰

Notch isn’t my Minecraft god anymore You’re a legend man, you leave us speechless, congratulation for this insane work  +1 sub

You wanted 80k likes? How's about 900k likes?
Snow field
😮
how is he this good!
I have a lore idea: The missing part of the island is actually the land where the stronghold is. Its far away so u need to go by boat. The mushroom is a part of the land. In that land there would be ruins of a lost city and in the middle its the portal
Bro imagine the stronghold.
a gigantic banana
Make New Mobs And Add A Boss For Each Boime
You are so nice!!!!!!!!! Taking months and months  possibly even years for people you don’t even know.
This is how it should be in my opinion, very medieval, very eye catching and creative. Gives that sense of adventure and life is going on in the world with or without you. First video I've seen on your channel and I'm impressed with the detail of editing and effort you put forth. Just earned another sub. 👍 keep it up.
Finish this so we cqn enjoy this masterpiece
Make this a RPG like Game, or somehow a MMORPG Game, if this is Done. :)
I would add some camps and ships not deatroyed
imagine this is an open world game trailer. enough to make the whole gamer community exited damn..
thats beyond cool thats a damn limit breaker
Can you say like how many months or years it took to make this masterpiece
This is sooooo cool well done
dame son wish this was a sever
Better mc
U should make ur own game dude
"hey builderman" 😳
I wanna download this
This was all built by one man, mojang has a group of designers who are kids compared to that
The savanna -> taiga transition doesn't make much sense if you were going for realism. Jungle -> savanna -> desert -> mesa -> taiga -> snowy mountains -> dark forest would be better. And ideally you'd want to have another taiga between the mountains and the dark forest, maybe making it 2x thinner on each side t not increase the work load.
This is ART.
This seriously cured my boredness
take that 900 k likes

Revelation 21:6-8 New International Version 6 He said to me: “It is done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. To the thirsty I will give water without cost from the spring of the water of life. 7 Those who are victorious will inherit all this, and I will be their God and they will be my children. 8 But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death..........
How can I get the map How can I download the world
I’m so excited to play this!
The island actually looks kinda small, I meant it is big but if you can cross from the centre to any biome in 4 minutes that’s very short, it looks good how it blends from the plains biome and slowly turns into a snow mountain biome for light green, green, to dark green
It’s literally like a fortnite map
Ddddddd
Can you put the seed in the comments pls
Download maybe?
Wooooooaaaaaawww when the map will be finish

Cuál es la semilla?

"a quaint windmill" is a cooler building than any of us have ever built
I think the snow biome should be based on the vikings maybe either religion it could make a real good story line

I would like to se a upgraded ocean monument
Awesome omg
today i’m having a really bad day of anxiety. i don’t usually ever feel anxious but this is so calming and soothing and relaxing to watch.
For the Wild West town you can do a story about a bandit
Mojan: write that down,write that down!!
Can we get this map on Xbox somehow??
Pls Give The Map Link pLs
,,Dumies, you dummy"
Wait how did you build the island soo fast
I like the idea of this basically just being a big open world game in of itself, with the pillager outposts being the typical things you climb to unlock more of the map
Tbh this is what I see Minecrafts final version as
Witch hut and underground lava cave arena
I have a question, anyone is welcomed to answer, but do you think he is gonna do the nether and end aswell??? If so good luck! Can't wait to play either way 🤗🤗🤗
I need download this map :0
This man built a world of every elder scrolls game

He make a ultimate world   Me : ummmm how to build cirlce
Imagine, this can be and actually mod pack like theres no way this shouldn't be a mod pack or a seed. Im literally speechless man. And btw, minecraft should hire you for doing this bro.
a huge part of the vanilla minecraft experience is traveling to the Nether and End dimensions. Perhaps upgrade those worlds as well(also, a more detailed lore)? That way the entire playthrough is enhanced to be 1000 times more immersive. I'm sooooo willing to pay for this.
Yes, we reached 80'000 likes. Actually almost 1'000'000
Ima sun
beautiful good job
#Mojang

This is *The* World in Minecraft!
Me: places one block* ughhh building is hard
esto va a ser impresionante

“Make sure to get this for 80k likes” *gets to 900k likes*

The hobbit houses are a nice idea, but I can't help but noticed you placed one beneath a tree. Where do the roots go but down? Nice work regardless
Almost 1 million likes you're so close
I have a idea maby you can make the monster more hostel and dangerous
THIS IS MINECRAFT!
I’m on Xbox so I can’t download or play on it 😥
It's the shading for me
Wow

I love the minecraft builds you know you could use Coptic architecture for some new builds
To be real I liked the normal outpost Tower more than the new one. But the other things  are awesome. I Love your Videos🥰
Don't forget the swamp mate!!
Dude you should totally make a game of this-
Mojang,  you taking notes?
Trixy: DESTROYS BUILDING AND MAKE A NEW ONE                                      Villiger: the FUTURE

whats that app in that video
masterpiece
Pls customize the nether as well as the end and pls add a Krsna or Buddha temple ... pls 🤞🤞
wow... I Can't wait to play in this world!!!
You need to join mojang
This damn map is probably one of the most interesting and cool ones I've seen but I seem VERY VERY unable to play it for almost 2 months now... What in the hell dude don't do this ;-;
That village reminds me of Townsmen (the game)
This makes me embarrassed to even think of my map 😂
I will play it if I can but ehh one problem THE LAG!!!!!
you could put tower defences around the jungle and vilages
12:00 WAIT THATS A CHURCH I THOUGHT THAT WAS A CASTLE 😭
Just imagine the game crashed and it wouldn’t let you join again
one half of my brain wants to play this world peacefully and create my own additions and another wants to grief it all with lava casts, tnt, certain symbols, until its just bedrock
When you use this map and rtx at the same time: CPU plasma
I stop playing Minecraft, for a couple year, come back and people, are doing this 😂
This map is giving me some BOTW vibes and looks very great
I'm definitely gonna play this when it comes out, I'll have to play on 2 chunks tho lol
Looking forward to bringing the create mod to that windmill you made. Looks great!
This looks like legend of Zelda botw
What version of Minecraft does he play on?? Im just curious
Is it bedrock, or just Java. And are you also doing the Nether and the End too?
Kerk protestants
Me just replaying the bit where the farm land gets wet
Trixy Blox, you should get some friends of yours that are good at terraforming, interior design, exterior design and you get the idea, to help you with these projects. they Don't have to be the best, just good enough. And if you can't find any help, start getting help from fans, connect with them. Then this will be completed in no time.
TrixyBlox: "...more like a cathedral but still felt small compared to how I usually build." 12:44 - 12:46     Understandable flex there TrixyBlox  And this transformation just...makes me feel so good for some reason. I love and I mean LOVE to transform things in MineCraft, and make them better. And by the way, your the reason I made my own transformed pillager outpost, as an oak because it was next to an oak village. You inspired me and I could go on and on about how good this is, but everyone knows how good it is. I could go on and on and on and on with this message being...                                        about this long... but I won't. Just keep up the absolutely magnificent work. And I tip my hat to you, one legend to another.
Mans out here makin this look like an ark world
And you’re already at 1.82 mil subs. This alone probably got a ton, I mean, it got mine
13:29 kinda bothers me that the villagers mixed the fields but I don’t think there’s anything that can be done about that
hi i'm new
Just wish it didn’t have facecam
what about nether and end
I love this idea of an RPG style map of Minecraft but I wish it were bigger, think about how awesome it would be if it was say each biome double render distance wide so it was impossible to see the other biomes, that would force the player to use maps and sign posts to get around and add a more lonely feel to the already well crafted well lived in map.
Started this project at 1 million now you’re almost at 2 mill(currently at 1.85 mill)
Download pls
If only I could build like that...
Minecraft please hire this guy
Woah,this looks like real deal mmorpg
I think he put something underneath the plain village's fountain
All I’m sayin is that the shape of this world is lookin kinda sus
In the ending cinematic, it would have been really funny if after you ran up the stairs to the nether portal, you turned around and threw a bunch of punches like Rocky Balboa
oh. my. god. this. is. amazing.
I would have also put a little stables in as well because how else would these villagers get transported around
lave-toi les dents frérot
I want to play this when it’s done
Make this permanent in Minecraft, replace everything.
Dude… THIS is why I subscribed to your channel. This is amazing. Though, the question is WHY are you doing this. I know you want to update Minecraft builds, but this just seems like too much work.
put link of the map
The algorithm loves u I've been seeing this alot
Mojang took one and a half year to add one of theese cliffs u made.
Bro is all pupil
2:46 a toilet in the middle of the map
Cannot imagine how long this took you
How to  make your own biomes like he does in the beginning
what a guy, asking for 80k likes, man you deserve far more from that, keep that amazing work!!!
Your building skills are amazing! I love the inspiration from BotW. And I'm already intrigued by the story lol
im just like... in shock... how tf do you do this its impossible. mind blown mate.
The new pillager tower you made reminds me of assassins creed
one thing i noticed is that you have gotten a lot better at confident commentary. great work, your videos always inspire me!
can you sent me the website or app that you use to design this map, if you can. thank you.
please choose mesa next please
I wish I could do things like this in Minecraft…
Include a rickroll
This is th first time I am actually thinking about creating a paetreon account and paying someone
“ay Mojang give this guy your chair”
For the ruins portal I recommend making the staircase fork out instead of the straight design
This is absolutely unbelievable. Hands down.
This is the COOLEST thing I’ve ever seen in Minecraft
Are you able to play this in bed rock addition
Yoo wtf, This is so gooood dude
Minecraft need to learn something from you
minecraft BOTW
I like how he gives attention to every single details
Seems like a battle royal map
Where can I find the app you used to create the world? I mean worldpaint
ARE U FUCKING JOKING?????? THIS IS SO GOOD! GOOD JOB BRO DAM!!!!!
It's unfortunate that there is a church at all. 😞
OMG THIS IS SO FANTASTIK WTF
This guy must’ve been in architectural class for at least his whole life O_O
When you get a train mod build a train station
Can you plese reLease IT dir free

I didn’t see you Any at the beginning but having the little random wells in the desert would be cool upgrades too
Good
fortnite
wow! this looks so COOL! i just found your channel via this video and im sooooo looking forward to playing this map if i ever can!
What if for the snow biom we just add a Viking village
I just found this and i honestly cant wait to see how the map turns out
What shaders do you use
13:46

The shader's really complements the builds it really looks amazing
Can Minecraft hire you I want this in vanilla Minecraft
If only I could build like that
Minecraft on another level my guy
How do I get this world 🗺😀
Love the work. Keep up the excellence.
Holy Mother of God
Is this free to play?
When you finish building and I play in the map, which biome/area do I head to first?
I already cant wait to play this with my friends when it comes out. You truly are amazing.
Pfff 80 000 likes? Ohh boyyy
lmao, he said *80,000* likes, this thing almost got 1 million now
How dose he make everything look soooo good
Wait maybe a secret in the void..?
"Make sure you get this video to 80000 likes" Turn out 900k likes
Mojang will litterally hire u if u show this to them
So, how many maps would he needed to cover it all?
Why are you not in Mojang yet?
This looks sooo good,i hope my phone can handle this
I've been watching videos in this series multiple times because Trixy's talent is off the charts undeniable. The canvas is Minecraft and he's an artist.
Wow. This is kinda awesome. When do you think it’ll be complete?
ami the only one who noticed ''dummy dummies?''
dude.. your buildings skills burn my brain cells
Mojang should just hire this guy.
time to pillage
Are you redoing the strong hold?
Woahhhh I hope I was you someday!! :0 THIS IS TOO COOL
The minecraft Developers need you
i have a question how many days did u build that
Where do I go to download the map
It would be really cool if some of the most popular hermits from hermit craft all and one biome of their own which they had domains on. It could kind of be like third life
If you have a PS4
You should do Minecraft survival mode a zombie apocalypse
An abandoned kingdom a place with loads of mobs but at the end you get the kings treasure I would do 5 blocks of gold
This would be a cool hermit craft kind of thing where the most popular hermits like scar grain and Mumbo and so forth all owned one biome and they could have domains on stuff I feel like that would be really cool
This is so amazing but I have a question are u going to add textured animals after you finish all of the biomes
Why is this man not in the minecraft team yet
flowers
You should make the nether as well
i want minecraft like this
You are so incredibly talented!!!!! ❤️ can’t wait to be able to play this world!!!
wow nice!
This project is INSANE !!!!!
It's not a cherch it's a brewery
I was exited for the Wild West town because I play rdr2
I feel like fundy's hardcore rpg will make this world way better
You are an amazing builder!! Holy chicken nuggets!!!
how can 5k ppl dislike this???? How can 1 person dislike this? This is fantastic!!!  This helps give me inspiration!
Do you decorate the insides of the houses
there isnt a birch forest and swamp...but good work tho
this would be perfect for vr minecraft. but im too poor to even afford a 5mbps internet
i am completely fascinated with this omg
Minecraft next generation?
If only Minecraft on console had world edit
My guys has the skills but he needs some damn whitening strips fr 💀
she look like a pac man
Hey idk if ur going to see this but I have a n idea for the mushroom biome is creating a giant over grown mushroom and creating a village attached to the mushroom tree
I would love to see Ryan not Brian play this custom map
Yes but does he know what level diamonds spawn on
Question: How will we get wood? the trees are too beautiful to chop down
You just created a complete fictional world like Middle Earth etc, amazing. What I miss a bit is a swamp
Omg love this you da best
That looks so epic
Custom secret dungeons
What’s the code to this world I think it’s very interesting and I would love to know how you made this it’s amazing
First, I'm not trying to be insensitive! But what is going on with his eyes? Is he missing eyelashes on his right eye? How'd this happen?
My friends and I are gonna have a blast in this map!
This was great
Will it then be possible to download it?
How do you take inspiration from botw plains? They're literally just normal grasslands.
Good job on this
Add mods like big creepy monsters

You should name that world trixycraft
The nether
What about the nether
“If you want the world download get this video to 80k likes”   *Gets 10x the likes asked*  *Pt 2 drops*  “If you want the world download don’t forget to support me on patreon”
Bro where do you get the motivation to do all of this all by yourself. Ive tried doing something like this but always end up giving up half way
I LOVE TO HAVE THE WORD PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i think this guy should have a competition with grian
If you're making game... This is perfect for an open world game not gonna lie
If I download this map I will destroy it because of a war
THIS IS WHAT MINECRAFT I WANT
I swear this is going down in history
In the snowy mountains can you maybe add statue’s and bases for the snowy fox clan and the wolf clan to add a backstory? Btw I love your vids and lately I’ve been watching so many of them to one day become a great builder like you ╰(▔∀▔)╯
I really want this in Minecraft
Are you going to forget to do the flower forest biome that's one of the most prettiest biomes
So... you made this cool thing?  Apparently Mojang Studios love people that make cool things like this you’re probably gonna get offered a job
THAT IS NOT A VILLAGE ITS A WHOLE CITY
Will this map be available for bedrock?
Can we have the map ? Plz
Wattles music...
will you put this on bedrock?
This man is a whole company....🔥
i thought i was a good builder but nope can even compare
Dinosaur mystery,with their fossils
I'm just gonna be that guy and say: Amogus Map
The man accidentally leaked Minecraft 2.0
*asks for 80k likes           *gets 900k
I wish I still had an imagination and architect ability like this, now i just find minecraft boring cause I dont know what to build
Where is the blacksmith?
Mojang needs to hire you
Minecraft and Skyrim had a baby.
Sign me up!! 😁
Now now... Lets imagine a big modpack (rlcraft, tech evolution, crazycraft, etc) in this  Damn im already hoping to see if its possible
Ziehe durch
Man i WISH i was this good at building, i’m good at survival and not building :/
This looks epic
Me who can't even properly design a dirt house:👁👄👁
Alternate title-WANO IN MINECRAFT *THEME PLAYS*
Feels like the quarry is out of place, it's too close to the center of the village. I mean when you think of a quarry, you think of dirt and stone. Maybe it should be a bit far out from the village. Overall still a great job,  hoping to see the end product soon!!!
I love minecraft but I can’t sit there for hours building and planning something I’m speechless with how good these were
i'm probably being a little over dramatic with this but , PEASE FOR THE LOVE Of GOD Teach Me Your Building Wisdom ETC,     (even though this is not a probable situation whatsoever I just felt like being a little dramatic, also your building skills are really good far better than I could ever do and, if I ever did have the chance to learn building etc from you I would take that chance)   Ps  Hi 👋🙂
Man alternate title: Legends of Zelda the breath of minecraft
Wow.
Felt amphibia vibes
Please do the caves!!!! Not all off them but it would be nice to have some customs ones..
Wow. Absolutely beautiful.
12:44 it looks more like a Chapel actually, like our Chapel here.
Making Amphibia in Minecraft be like:
Imagine if, in 2030, this is just what a normal minecraft world looks like.
12:44 it looks more like a Chapel actually, like our Chapel here.
The music just making me appreciate the villager
When can we download this?
Cant wait to blow up these villager houses XD
Can you do the dungeon with the end portal in the mountain biom? Oh and if possible a kind of either Greek or Buddhism style plz
Is it good to download
Hey TrixyBlox, have you already sent out this map or are you gonna send it out after you're done building the whole world?(if u do what website will u sendit in?)
How do I do this :)
Geez dude.. You- How- Wha?- HOW DO YOU DO THIS MAN!? You're so talented my guy! Also when I saw this video I subscribed instantly.
He’s making Mojang look lazy😆
wow bro you better than me that building I cant believe it damn
BRI ISH INNIT
how to dowload!!!!!!!!!!
I miss burning up village   Now i can't burn it anymore
Only 14 likes more for 900k likes :D
😨
me joining the minecraft map: LAG INTENSIFIES
If this is available on console as well I'm definitely going to want to play on this
Hey the pillager base reminds me of ghost of Tsushima nice
By the time Trixy finishes this he’d be on 2 million subs
Isn’t 16,000 blocks only enough for one map?
minecraft: the anime fantasy edition
Me on bedrock edition ;_;
For the zombie village you should make diary entries of some sort of virus
Yay :D good job! I mean it so much!
The question is: why didn't you change the cactus look? I was pretty sure you would, though....
Unfortunately for me, I play on bedrock so it doesn't seem likely that i'll be able to actually play this map but it is really fun to watch you make such incredible and detailed builds you truly are inspiring and skilled. I also hope you get enough sleep though because I can't imagine how long it would take to make such astonishing things.
We definitely need a beekeeper profession in the next mc update.
How can i use this map on Xbox One??🙏🏼
Me realizing it will only look good with rtx
This has so much lore 😍 when it comes out imma just devote myself to writing possibly an action google doc about it and alex/steves adventures
you should make a resource pack so that when you plant trees they naturally grow as your custom ones
I think you need to work with mojang to improve all of this stuff
love this
You should transform the nether
Wow! Like wow 🤩 I’m so impressed, this is the best project !!!!!
if i could dislike twice, i would.
Lore idea: Since you said there are going to be villager diaries, could you make pillager history pages? Scatter pages around the tower and when the player collects them all, you could do whatever story you want. it would be really cool.
I would like to play your map, I've always wanted to play a world like this but I just dont have the skill to build it... Good Job!
Thats so cool
this got a few more than 80k likes
Wow! I'd love to see a village in a Egyptian style, like the portal frame ❤ my main love is creating functional villages that I can later stumble upon them while playing survival. Everything is so eye catching and detailed. I'm currently making a pyramid but with a layer of arched windows like kingslanding (game of thrones)
Mushroom biome is like the weird cousin you never talk with.
With the shaders on it feels like a realistic game I wish i can add this world on my nintendo
Trixy:I want 80K Us:how bout 897k
Hey Trix add a ice spikes biome
Alternative title: the best sussy island
This is so DAMN amazing. I need to play this world
OK let’s just hope that somebody else will help us when this entire thing is done  Also maybe you can make another island with things that you did not use  :)
How long did it took you??????????
And this is how God created the earth 😂
This is just a small detail but maybe you could buy barrels in the middle of the wheels on the wagon you made for the cleric (in the plains village).
for the snowy biome put an attacked campsite!
How do you do this I can barely even build that good
U should make a pagan wizard hut in the mushroom biome
looks cool but the trees will be hell to cut down
Trixyblox: “I want to make them into mysterious traveling merchants”  Me: I now know what I must do (Pulls axe out)
Now I’m making my own survival map
I need 80,000 likes to continue this project  Community: “879,000, take it or leave it”
Underground he should build like high tech laboratory and camera screens everywhere like if you where a test subject/s(if playing online) and to give that "what happened here" vibe he should make it like it was attacked and abandoned for a long time
I want to play on this world, I just know whatever house I build was going to look so dumb
Those must be some happy pillagers
Can't wait till this comes out!!
this man "accidentally" doubled his work
I think when this project is done, nobody will build their own base. Everyone will just move into one of your structures.
This. This is how Minecraft should be
Try adding an Atlantis as in like ruins that got sunk under the ocean during an intense war
The hunger games if this was the map: Everybody has full diamond with protection 4 thorns 3 and 10 enchanted golden apples Everybody --_--
Amestris be like :
I really this world but i think it is a bit unfair that you only let your Patreons play it. For example let's say you really want to play this world but your parents/Guardian doesn't let you because it costs money
daamn i wish my minecraft wasn't cracked (don't come at me saying to buy the game i have my reasons)
New sub cause this is AMAZING😎 Imma keep an eye on this world seed
Can you add a secret underground mine in the Mesa biome
It is much better than I thought, the project you are doing is incredible. You have a new subscriber and GREETINGS FROM PERU!
Minecraft need to learn from you because its incredible
=<)
What shader did you use for this? It looks stunning!
To bad I can't afford minecraft 😢 If I had minecraft I would DEFINITELY play this map          Meh poor.....
This is he best thing I have seen
13:18 barrels of hay
Bonjour est-il possible de télégarger la map ?
I like the church
:0 IS THAT?! *trixy*
Please make a swamp biome even if it’s small I like the swamp
Am i the onlly one who feels like the world he's going to make is very rpg like, more specifically mmorpg like, i really love it
if only minecraft actually looked like this. instead it looks... eh, bad, compared to this
Im gonna download this when this is finished since my friends and i are going to roleplay in this
Why couldn’t you add a hydroelectric wheel to the river in the village?
What about the nether
I really like that the farmer gets a big house, in history it was very common for the owners of big farms to be some of the richest in the land, and I feel like people overlook farming a lot and always go for the "poor struggling farmer" stereotype. It's really refreshing to see something different.
I completed breath of the wild so I can help with the buildings. Since you are making the cherch look like the temple of time and maybe the forest can have the grate deku tree in it! (I ment the forest biome)
I would like to see a tavern in one of the biomes for travelers to eat and rest.
Is it possible to get diamonds and iron and such in this world?
This video are how god make a world
About playing in survival - those trees are going to be really akward to cut  Hope that tree capitator mod will work on them, bcs i look forward to try this map out
Mojang should have hired you to build the 1.14 villager huts
caves?
"If vanilla villages were actually like this, no one would explode them and mistreat wandering traders." Change my mind
When i heard you placed 16.M blocks..... Why did the subsribe button turned grey?
This is amazing 🤩 and 5k people are stupid
Imagine this was the normal minecraft maps and he had to upgrade this!!
And mods
I think a role play story is gonna be so good for this map
I love how when he talks about some structures he like “minor details” and makes it better than any house I’ve ever seen in Minecraft
Awesome
Get this video to 80k likes Us:hold our beers
Idea: With the Mesa Biome, in a mine you should an abandoned DMC-12 from Back To The Future Part 3
I just realized, there isnt a single birch tree lmao
He wanted 80k likes, he already got 800k and now he’s on his way to 900.000
Minecraft could never😂
Minecraft should be more like this
This is the best project I have ever seen in Minecraft!!
Looks super good ngl but i miss a treehouse in the plains for a loner with a greenhouse in it i would love it
Absolutely amazing
Will it be on realms
IS THERE A SEED FOR THIS WORLD OR PLACE!!!!!?????..
He really really likes his mega builds
Amazing
s o o.     g o o d
Minecraft needs a story update  Just small details like diary’s and maybe random names for all the villages? Just small stuff   This looks amazing!
This whole thing reminds me of the arena from hunger games 2 lol  Excpet this.. Amazing job as always
This is like the new very popular 1 block skyblock wadzee series
Imagine a build project with Trixy, Grian, Scar and Bdubs... mind blown
Trixy you need to join hermitcraft
When the 2b2t players get their hands on this… “Is this a mega base?” “idk but lez blow it up”
You're awesome.
I'm late to the party, but this is gorgeous, I never stopped smiling
Mans just created da whole breath of the wild map
Hey!YOU CAN PUT THIS ON ADDONS BECAUSE THIS WOULD BE A GREAT MAP BECAYSE YOUR GOOD AT BUILDING!!!!!!!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥰🥰🥰🥰
I hope in the future Minecraft with look just like this it’s amazing
For a Survival game we need mine Shaft, caves and Minerals
Now THIS is a world i want to play without going into creative from pure rage and giving myself all the endgame items.
Skebedebabbaaaab
is it worth downloading the map?
Imagine having a costum mod mob like a giant snow monster's to snow biome!
Its so sad that almost 10 million people have watched this video but only 1 million are subscribed :/
Is this amphibia?????
Well, you just inspired me to try making another map  in order to make an apocalyptic city. Just gotta finish the McDonald’s first
:/ You forgot a blacksmith. (Sorry if I’m being nit-picky)
The village turns out to be more beautiful than i imagined :)
I love how at the start when he was talking about how he made the world he talks about it like it was nothing like he didn't just do something that a computer, made to generate worlds and biomes, struggles to right quite a lot
i fear people who can make good builds in minecraft
How are you so good at building and how do you get better, like how do I get more creative and less lazy/more ambitious and have more perseverance?!
I can’t wait to see let’s plays of this map, having the community come together to discover the story and Easter eggs as well as marveling at your amazing build skills will be so much fun! Can’t wait to play this map for myself with my friends!
You just made the clerk a wandering trader
I literally just came
if you ever start to think that you're pretty good at building just watch this video again
this is... beautiful
Literally Wano
can u play this on console?
I want to watch a let's play of this (since I don't have a computer/laptop)
Anyone else wants to play on his world just to see what it’s like lol 😂😂😂😂
The large cathedral makes sense,  medieval societies often centered around the church/cathedral, and was often one of the largest buildings
Imagine you are a pour Villager in your failling Village and a god like man flyes down and builds you a new gian AMAZING Village!
Well it be available for consuls🤔🤔🤔🤔
13:45 whoo now I can't massacre the entire village anymore jk your builds are amazing
Ficou legal
I was starting to think it resembled the botw map...
I am mind blowen, amazing built
My man's looking like a minecraft David Dobrik
Oh you should add cool igloos!
I’m sorry, but you live in Bedrock edition
the map gives me big ARK vibes
If I ever played on this map, any structures I build would be an insult to the world 😭✨ Edit: :0 that’s a lot of likes 😅 thanks everyone :3
This is awesome! So inspiring for my own world, too!
Me when I see the farm: Where's the beets?  Everyone else: WHO CARES ABOUT BEETS!!!
This is gonna be so awesome I can't wait
This guy should buy minecraft
You should make a boss in each biome that come together as a giant boss
MOJANG.. SIGN THIS MAN
When it's finished you should do an edit with  the Ice and Fire mod it would look so cool with dragons and mythological creatures 🐉 🐲 ❄ 🔥   If this gets 10k likes he should have to
How to download this world
Beautiful
This has 9m views
Can I get a map
Petition for TrixyBlox to join Hermitcraft. He would have the most ridiculous megabase we have ever seen!
I wanna make a adventure map and I'll credit trixyblox

The fact that the church was small for him compared to his usual builds just puts it into perspective of how TALENTED he is like bro I couldn’t even make house as detailed as he did
Wow I'm speechless that so nice 🙂 wish I can do that 😂🤣😂..
Trying survive the minecraft 100 days all your bid prc can you survive the minecraft 100 days also seek review
This is insane!!
Keep a fair bit of vanilla trees scattered around for actual use, for two main reasons.  I would hate to tear down an artistic build, and would end up not getting enough wood, And there are many "extra" blocks used in them, like planks and slabs. That would clutter an inventory.  I suggest keeping the 'special' trees as are, but adding a few small forests scattered around as a way to fill space. Keep up the good work!
Would you coach me
Was the traveling merchant wagon at 11:40 based off of fable 2? If so that's awesome
Watching this video makes me realize just how terrible I am at building.
Wow
This is just literally skyrim on minecraft
Trixy blox:but you still need a diamond pickaxe for that Dream:are you sure about that
Is this available for bedrock?
The fact that you put all the biomes in such an ordered way is more of an insult to your entire map.
He asked for 80 k likes... He got 800 k instead
D*mm, this is so nerve-wracking! I want to play in this server, but my potato phone won't make it (probably). Anyways, amazing video
I really hope he’ll make it downloadable on bedrock
Minecraft 2.0
WATAHA
The chivalrous palm biosynthetically imagine because weight karunagappally ban below a well-off japanese.  fresh, sassy moon
What if mojand really add this
I just realised this map is fin a be like red dead
Imagine if this is what mincraft was normally like
Dude this shit is BEAUTIFUL
u should make a jungle tree house
Will there be a village in the mushroom biome?. cause if there is. make mushroom houses like in Mario and make them have a farm of mooshrooms
You really should make that a public server.
Yoooo the clouds do be faster than yo mamas car
You should put iron golems in the village
How much do I have to pay to get this map sent to me on ps4
He wanted 80k. He got that eleven times.
you:i want 80,000 likes others:889k you mean
Imagine trixy and grian collaborating
Kann man die Map Downloden ?
this would be halarious to speedrun good job though on this build ur so talented
With all the money Mojang has and the development team at their disposal, it blows my mind how bland vanilla minecraft is and how long it takes them to come out with updates.   I genuinely believe it'd be a smart move by them to employ you to spruce up their vanilla minecraft. Or just do it themselves, it's not like they don't have the money or manpower.
A tunnel system
A secret cave system

A village that fell into the water would be interesting or build a town around the underwater monument. Maybe the Island was bigger sometime in the past but parts of it sunk into the ocean for some odd  reason with villages.
Oh my god- I need this in my life.
You os god
Join hermitcraft
absolutely amazing. my only critique, and I do not mean they are bad, they are also extremely outstanding builds, you said you were aiming to be quaint with the village, and the church and windmill could've maybe been a tad smaller. that's how i would've done it if it were me at least. it's still incredible the amount of skill, time, and effort you put forth for this project and i can't wait to see what else you make!
I feel like a kid entering a candy shop. This is too good
Where is the link to download the map?
the people who disliked are just salty because they wish they could build something like this world
download map ples bro
Imagine creating this in survival
mojang please hire this guy
Ooh what about a buddhist theme for the jungle
Add this man to hermitcraft
this is insane wow
Buried ships in the desert!  (And maybe a spaceship buried somewhere)
I hope you remake the witches hut
You are crazy
Mojang should hire u
How long did this take u to build???
now, this *points at screen* is CONTENT.
Barrels on their side and with an item frame and black wool in the frame make great wagon wheels.
The and the map is absolutely awesome    I mean not to be offensive but… what’s wrong with ur teeth??
That’s not Minecraft that’s ✨Minecraft✨ (but serious it’s awesome)
My god man this is breath taking if minecraft had this level of detail I'd be insane I mean the game is fun as hell already but this just...damn
This is just awsome
@Paluten reagier mal hier drauf
You should add a creepy mansion in the forest and some huge skeletons in the mountains. (And maybe some giants too)
don’t forget the nether?
don’t forget the nether plzzzz
Why don't you work with mojang?
I'm sad he's not doing the swamp. It's my favorite biome.
He just like me
bee farms can also be called apiaries
bro how do you do that i think it takes a lot of time
You know, that island with all the biomes would make an awesome Hunger Games arena. Put the Cornucopia and tribute tubes in the lake near the middle and add an energy dome.
it would be nice if you added more rivers or water sources around the map because it looked like there were very few around the map
This is epic
Wano
reminds me of bionicle island mata nui
80k likes?  At an extra 0 There 800k that's better
Yep This Is A Masterpiece
Dude you are literally god, can you call that little pond or lake you made sperm lake?
My guy, this is just beautiful. The things you do on this game is just amazing and truly a pleasure to watch.
I wish all of that structure and world generation were added to minecraft but I'm sure mojang will reject that idea :(
Can we download your creation?  Pls
Hey Trixy, I was just wondering whether you could maybe post this map on mcpedl.com? Just as it kind of makes it unfair for Bedrock/PE players who want to play the map. But if not that is totally fine as it is your choice.
Notch may be the Creator, but this man is the God of Minecraft
6:53 I juts noticed that after watching this 457 timess

OMG this needs to be a official Minecraft seed when it's all finished
I like this a lot, BUT...  I'd love to see you finding a nice seed that has a Mushroom Island, a Mesa, Desert, and most other biomes close by.  Then upgrading the center of the infinite map with your stuff, the Nether and the End as well.
the PATIENCE
Could we just have the island un-transformed as well? That also looks really cool!
I wish Minecraft would always be like this
NGL but the map looks sussy
Damn.
the way this guy builds makes me want to buss
Woah

All you can say about this is that it is amazing, it also shows how many possibilities there are in this game, I am already waiting for you to finish this world.

This is Crazy Project
Seed? :(
Just a note theoretically you don’t have to get a diamond pick to make a portal just a bucket to move lava and water!
Alternate tile: I transform a normal world into a anime style and scaled world
I pondered about a couple ideas that you could add to the map, and here is what I thought of: What if you did something cool with a ravine, like maybe a mini-village that has found themselves living there. I feel like there are a lot of cool things you could do with ravines and caves, especially underwater ones. I feel not every underground structure has to be original, but you could definitely do some pretty neat things with those. I was thinking of a Tree-house village for the jungle, instead of the village being on land. Though, some parts of the village being on land and some parts of the village being in the trees would be just as cool in my opinion. I also thought for the Jungle biome, what if there were random, mossy, stone staus littered around the area? I'm not sure how to put it, but there could be a pretty good lore opportunity! I always picture stone status in jungles, sooo- I saw this idea commented on in another video, so don't give me the credit for this. Someone had the idea of a Viking-like area in the snowy biome. As if Vikings had lived there long ago, it seems. Also, watching this video makes me wonder if you're going to do anything with the End, like re-design the pillars, portal, end city, etc. Following that, it also makes me wonder if you're planning to do anything with the Nether. For example, what if u made a Piglin village in the nether, or re-designed the Nether fortress. Maybe even some original things like some save-houses, as if villagers had come to the Nether and built those in case anyone needed them.  All in all, this entire idea is absolutely stunning and I believe the finished product is going to be amazing! Your work so impressive and absolutely stunning, keep it up! (I may be editing this comment in case I get more ideas IDK)
Amazing.
I wish I could I could play this map! Unfortunately I don’t have Java Edition. ☹️
Please make a icy lake!
Can you pls make this free.
Wish you could show a tutorial for these amazing builds
Dowload?
Computer :   Easyyyy Phone       : help meee

THAT'S SO COOLL
Who else CAN'T WAIT for the bob ross reference
I’ve seen your builds a few times, of course the more popular ones back in the day. But i’ve never really felt the need to sub since i was on console and could never play/do any of that myself.   Now that i’m finally on PC and have found your content again, you 100% earned my sub. Can’t wait to see how this map turns out, and more importantly i can’t wait to try it out for myself! Ahh how things play out…   Cheers m8 🕊🤍
The first game that I ever played where you could manipulate was sim city, then sim earth. I just started to fool around with Minecraft. I'm from 1979. What you and your female friend did her blow my mind. It was so relaxing and enjoyable to watch. Awesome work man, just awesome. 🙂❤️👍
Ice dragon in minecraft this minecraft become a rlcraft
Me: Wait Theres only 9? Also Me: oh we also talking about ocean
The only problem with this world is that anything you build would be worse than all the structures
imagine he forgot to record :v
Build dmc delorean in mesa
The map can be put in Minecraft pe?
Include cool but balanced loot and bosses.
Minecraft creators should add in a world painter mode in the game so anyone could make these great lands of fantastic creations
hello from Ukraine! such efforts and few likes and subscriptions! in the CIS, youtubers do not try and gain tens of millions, but here there is not even 1 .... good luck!
Enggak capek bang buat beginian 😂😂😂
Where to download
Refrences to the old builders
I have an idea. At the plains, can you added a volcano and inside it is some parkour and at the end of it, a treasure
It got 863K+ likes... where's the seed-
Download world???
‘I am trying to scale the church down from what I normally do’ Builds a giant cathedral ‘It’s kinda small’
Does. This guy realize that no one will be able to beat this? Not because of difficulty or missing structures, but because no one will destroy the amazing builds.
You should consider doing a small Pueblo settlement in the Mesa biome along with the Wild West town. It would look really cool mounted inside the canyon walls
I want to be like this but I’m trash  Better get grinding
How do you all this stuf like the paste and world creator  Also what’s the seed for the empty world without the builds  Would like to know because I’m a creative person and feel like I could create something nice
Omg this is crash..B-)
How to download it dude? This is awesome

this is beyond gorgeous @o@
can you do the nether
I want install this map
How ca I dowload that map
I want to build like this
This is the reason I just subbed
Perhaps you could create your own faction based around an original theme?  Plus, the majority of minecraft worlds are based around water. Much like our own. But, I don't feel like it gets enough attention. Perhaps you could add underwater builds like temples, shipwrecks and ships far out in the ocean for players to find lore/diary entries and some treasure.  Cheers, and I'm really looking forward to future updates on this build's progress.
I wanna play on your map in survival
I'm fascinated
"Did he say 80 likes?" "Nah nah,     800 thousand likes"
I dont know how you get dislikes- These are amazing
You are realy good
Zoo in savanna

As a future project could you make the cities from marvel? Such as wakanda, asgard, etc
churches usually has cooper roofs which turns green. and since the new update features cooper maybe u should try it?
His sound like a tommyinnit
Wano???
I think it's 1 year before you done
Wath seed?

You deserve a lot of subscribers dude!
I do not speak english. (Translator) Could someone tell if this map is downloadable?
5:15 how did you removed that? I wanna learn too.   Suggestion idea: Can you make a deepest sea part for the rare sea creatures? Like Mariana Trench...
I think the hermits would definitely enjoy this
wow???????
i mean... upgading is quite subjective
Nice
You should add a camp site in the Plains biome.
80.000 likes? More like 800.000!!! Wow!
OH MAY GOD, THIS IS OWESOME😭😭😭
I hate to be this guy but... 4,000 x 4,000 isn't 16,000. It's 16,000,000.

Maybe once you get to the Mesa biome you can include a train that has derailed?

How did you take the thing you painted into a Minecraft world??????
It looks like an island from Bionicle
Minecraft should hire You as a creative director or something 😂. Would make the game 10x better
You can build epic upgrade woodland mansion in dark wood forest
where can i download this map ?
Very good
And im happy when i do a modern mansion...
I never really was interested in Minecraft videos and haven't even played Minecraft in -- what, 10 years. But this video was super interesting to watch, you really got eye for art, placement and world building too.
Looks so cool. This would be a great survival world or hunger games
Man, there should be a mod that replaces normal structures with yours
Since the biome was slide up unnaturally, u should add wall that separate all of them, much more epic that way
2:59 Did.. did you crop a pp out of that photo?
How i play in this mão bro, this ia very cool wow
"there's gonna be story in this map" everyone get your game theory voice
Seria incrível uma igreja com cripta

Do the islands have a name?
WOW god job would definitely play this as a survival map keep up the good work.
I plsy breath of the wild

Who cares about miscalculations when a sheer amount of creativity is at work. Adapting your craft to fit vanilla's default standards can be a tricky affair, which Oscar, fucks knows how, always pulls off.
version 1.18 should be like this, don't want to know😂😂
Is the map free
Wow, I put this on the fall asleep to but I've watched through the whole thing your work is unbelievably amazing and impressive I cannot wait to play this map
Make a beach Biome!, it can have like palm trees, and huts for villages!

i had this idea already. just didnt have a youtube channel too make one. also i cannot edit so yeah. so mayb in the future i could actually make an inspiration build from you. with a lot of difference so no copyright

I’m excited for the Mesa biome

This man just recreated Skyrim elder scrolls IV
Minecraft is been here since more than 12 years, but still Mojang didn't understand that this is what we want.
wow. this  is  amazing.
The building of each structures,biome design is so great :0 i wish i can be a great builder in minecraft :O
Wow amazing bro
should put a massive tower that you work your way up by fightning modded enemys, that would slap
You should degrade everything in Minecraft
When you added the oak log piles too the pillager outpost you said it like it's a new thing that isn't in vanilla when log piles do spawn around pillager outpost
Is the map circular so you can continue to build out from it in the future?
It's about time! I've been waiting for you to do something like this!
How do I download it
I want to get that world but on android Can it?   If you can please give your world link
Give me this world download please broi
80k likes x 10 u say

This makes me rather live in the village than my own house 😂😂😂
I feel like downloading this world would destroy my computer
The pillager tower in the plains biome looks like a pee pee and balls

Minecraft needs advanced AI, I would like to see a time lapse of an aireal view of a developing society.
get about 200 people and do a hunger games in the huge map
Im assuming since this was started a month ago its not 1.17 ready?
Trixyblox : get to 80k likes   Viewers :850K likes take it or leave it
Suggestion. You should add craters in crushed meteorites or something like that
Me build a house: it looks good Me after seeing this: fucking trash it is

Imagine someone grief this tahtd messed up

I want to play in it like in ALfheim Online (SAO)
I look up to this dude a lot negl
This is amazing 🥺💜

I just made my first video for a new SMP! Come and check it out!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_gijI2NsCs
Wait, are you going to transform the nether as well?
wow.. I just love it!! You're such a good builder. I started a little minecraft project with the Origins mod, making kingdoms spliting the origins, but I'm not a good builder and don't have world edit, so It's kinda impossible, since there's 5(or more) kingdoms...  Anyways, good work bud, will seek to play on your map with some friends one day :D
This idea is great, awesome map and buildings, I have some ideas to add as details like caves/mines, but for a better understanding of how biomes connect/work as well as rivers and mountains u should watch Artifexian's videos
If notch will see this video he will appreciate you for your work and creativity:)
Map is kinda sus
Hope it would be available on Android version 🥺🥺
Minecraft Should Hire This Man
What problem just to turn on BiomesOplenty?
Download?
This is art! 👏✨
Wowwwwwww awsome but how many hours or month u spent
Anyone else reminded of Amestris from Fullmetal Alchemist?
Mojang needs to add this into the game absolutely wonderful village
this looks like the whole map of Albion online! This is so cool!
Oh... My... 🦆ing... GOD!!!!! I LITTERALLY HAVE TO DO THIS!!! (Me after 5 minutes: 🦆 this i'm 2 bad XD)
Bro , loved it , I subscribed u , like you , shared it and even subscribed by mother,s , father's and all my freinds phone !! Please provide this map ! I want to play it !!😢☺️😊
Bruh... this is beautiful
For the map, you should auto generate the completed fully scaled map
Yes i only just saw this but i really really wanna play this world and man- let’s go Zelda! That’s my family’s fav game to play on the switch
Put protective gates around each biome border and have a no mans land area in the middle with statues of each protector in a shrine monument
You have done underground and water kingdoms next do sky based on the air temples from the last airbender
I love your video, but you need to rest, take a break🙆🙆
Dude. I can't even imagine the time that it took to do this video. Let alone, the build itself. You are truly a god of your work. Amazing job my man. You definitely deserve every bit of recognition  for these absolutely stunning builds. Can't wait to see what the future has in store for your channel. <3
yoo i justrealized that one minecraft animation team could use this
First thing i see on the thumbnail:  AMOGUS
Man, this world; fucking god it's wounderfull, It's even better than every world i've seen in every game, even in dungeon and dragons
Wich programm do you use for creating the map? This looks incredible
is there any way to download this map?
Does it take you for ages if it does you are a goat at minecraft
I want this world! Its amazing!
I hope it’s free…
What app did you use to make the island
this... is... beautiful?????? oh my fRiG???
Damn you're good
It would be cool if you added some secrets and new structures into the nether and end as well I think. Maybe even a new biome. And perhaps you could add secrets weapons which cannot be crafted in normal game or smthing like that. I cannot wait till you finnish this map, keep it up!
Your phumpnail is sus
Alguém aqui veio pelo link do jazzghost?  Kkkk
Minecraft should make all that you do into the actual game it’s amazing
Amogus
its very good but where is nether
The Nether Portal.. i think the high uhm...Arch??? (Sorry, im german ;) )  looks a LOT nicer than the one you choose after it. But i would never have thougt of the Stairs and chains and so.(You could have made more Nather though.)
80k likes x 10
I wish you can remake my house and  nether portal I made, and maybe add stuff to the world to make it more full
This is so freaking cool
Jesus Christ is the only way into heaven

Add a mosque!!!
Coral reef for the ocean
Hmmmmm...
I love your dedication
Is it possible to get it on console
You may add some ancient books or journals spread out of the map which tells about something in the area. For example, it could be a journal of ancient traveller that wrote down some tips or memories about locations and they now buried in places of his former camps. These journals shall tell us how this world was before we came. For example, in one journal we may find a description of local village in which locals found some dark secrets and the treveller has some bad feelings about this. And then we find abounded village with zombies. Another journal can tell us about desert cult and later we find old pyramid. I think it is great idea because you can add a lot of background and stories to your bouldings. Also, you could add a lot of tips and hints about your secrets. The final journal tells us about what happened with the treveller and point to his final camp which is cozy abounded house far away and therefore we as a players can become his heir and continue to explore the world
Why not make this map and a mod pack so you can really bring the story to life how you see fit so it can be even better
Imagine playing this in RTX with some mods that actually add in extra bosses and monsters and stuff, sorta along the lines of RLCraft and Crazy Craft. That would be absolutely amazing :3
What's the name of the texture pack?
For a separate video can you transform the Woodland Mansion?
Mine craft is best
I know i now why minecraft dont update struckture so even cool Cus they dont have a master builder
Will you be revamping the nether for this map too?
Add some villager in the marshroom biom pls
Dude be building Wano Kuni
Asked for 80k got 800k. My man has made it
Don’t forget a flower forest! I’d love to see your take on a faerie like place!
Missed opportunity to put just a huge tree in the center of the plains
Could transform the church in the desert village into a mosque? Given that the largest hot desert in the world is also the heart of Islam
You can build a whole new minecraft worth billions of blocks and items, and i cant even build a house. But it makes a little sense since i spend lots of my time in mass farming, ultra mining (lots of mining) and automating/redstoning.
God these videos never cease to amaze me!! How do people get so good at building!!!
THIS is what vanilla minecraft should have been... the game has not changed for 10 years
minecraft shod hire this guy for the struckers
I need to play in it to bad it’s not a mod 🙁
We need to make this happen as a server map omg i love this

Is the underwater Kingdom gonna be in this world?
I want to say that he should add the nether but the over world is so big that don’t want him to work to much-

Endor reference I'm the jungle
Who want this world For bedrock players.plzzzz

Id
In the same world, You should do the same thing but, I replaced everything in the nether and then we can go into the nether and as soon as we have everything unlocked, we unlock the nether, and as soon as where done everything in the nether, then we unlock the END. Just a cool idea, hope you see this! By the way like if you like this idea 💡
Question, what about the caves?
Fun fact: that's not a church mojang confirmed it was just a buliding where someone uses and makes potions
I want to play this just for the bob ross reference
Ur a fucking god
Lit bro

Mojang needs to give this guy a job 👏🏻

Does this work in bedrock?

This is minecraft 1.18
You are a legend
I COULD NEVER MAKE THAT
This is everything I ever wanted. What I most love to explore are Woodland Mansions. The fact that there's a huge mysterious mansion VERY far away is fantastic

Need 10 years to upgrades hehe... Just kidding
Add a “nuke the fridge “ aftermath scene in the desert
this is so cool, i really enjoy watching these kind of minecraft videos. keep it up man!
I could totally see a tundra village in this map. It's mostly made from stone and its defining features are how drab, looming, and serious it looks, but it features a lot of stained glass windows and the most important building is the church/temple/synagogue or maybe it's even a castle. Windhelm from Skyrim is a big inspiration for the idea.
6:53 Dummies, You Dummy
i am... fully... very much IMPRESSED 😭♥️✨
You know these videos teach me one thing: the more grass the better...
Cara isso é muito top
6:52 -Dummies youre Dummies (Have ti watch faster)
Since you are using zelda as a reference the ruins of a castle to explore would be interesting....(sorry for any mistake english is not my first language)
I wish my building skills were this good🥲

I love how the plains is based off breath of the wild! It’s one of my favorite games!

Add a hidden sky island like from Sonic
Hey, frankly that's an incredible work ! Why not adding a lovecraftian-themed structure in the snow moutain biome ? Like in "at the moutain of Madness" :D  But i don't want to give you unmakable ideas, you are already an incredible builder.
Swamp?
What about neither structures and end
actually reminds me of the land of ooo from adventure time with all of the separate biomes.
(Get this vid to 80k views)
do i know why i watched this? no.         is it cool? yes
I think the snowy mountain biome would be perfect for an abandoned stronghold/castle

That’s amazing!!! 🤩🤩🤩 I think u should add ancient ruins, which would be differents in each biome...
Are we able to download it?

Ohhhhhhhhhh you know what you should do: transform the some of the nether as well
Why can’t actual Minecraft be like this
Hats off to you man
Minecraft 1.18 looks amazing
Speaking of boulders... Minecraft should definitely add those someday lol
This is mind blowing bro
I think I would be dope if you added Indian reservations or more camp kanda Elements to the more Forest parts of the map, I also think it would be cool if you added more industrial revolutionary things to the more northern areas of the map. I also think it would be also cool to have a full fleshed out story to add to the fun
He works really hard on this. As an encouraging word of advice.  Trixy keep up the good work and take your time! You do 100 time better with time and you will surely be rewarded with it as we patiently wait.
POV: you're the cameraman
This would be great for a battle royale map!
He should put some red dead redemption 2 stuff
Wait 80,000? Man you hit over 800,000
How do I get this map
TrixyBlox: Let’s get this vid to 80k likes  Fans: Let’s just multiply that by 10
I could never do this
Lets be honest spruce is one of the best looking woods hands down
Back in 2017 there was a city map for MCPE called NXUS and it was one of most highly detailed maps for PE it would be dope if there was i city area similar to that in this map!
I have to download this game😍😍😍
Will the map be free?🤔
The wonderful mirror importantly dress because can crucially coil mid a simple cloud. abounding, dry cry
Why doesn’t he just call vanilla villages.......vanilages.🤣🤣🤣
What do you use to create everything
I really gotta learn how to use world paint lol
“Get this to 80,000 likes”  It’s got way more the 80,000
On my SMP we actually have a ruined portal the size of the one this is video I actually think mine is bigger though
A pub in the village? Maybe a football/rugby/cricket pitch?
This really makes you think about Minecraft as a whole. Treasures, story and lore, secrets, mysterious buildings, enormous mountains, deep valleys, and empty plains that go out as far as the eye can see. It's kinda heartwarming actually.
Pls tell me your gonna do the nether too that would be so cool🙏🙏🙏
Will this be on bedrock once its finished. Or be on the marketplace? I dont have java, but I really want to play this once its finished?
I've got a question will you do the nether and end aswell or will it just be the overworld?
My guy really said he was gonna make the plains simple.....
That looks insane dude. Keep going, you have talent 😌🤞🏻
What if he does the nether and ender
Include Heribrine
Is there a way i can play on this world with a friend?
um download link?
Watching this as I flew to a woodland mansion that I got off a map of a villager. Turned out to be 22000 blocks away…😔😔😔
Zelda breath of the wild!!!
I have two ideas.  First idea: an destroyed ufo. Second idea: a little island with an abbandoned spaceship! Tell me if you like it!
+1 sub, I m gonna look up for download the map :p
Walls ( wooden, tiny 2-5 blocks would bring a nice feel to the village, as they would then clearly have been scared by the zombies, creepers, spiders and sceletons, and shielded themselves from those threats. My opinion, not yours.
Bro i cant Build a normal house Respect
You lost me at the fences in the trees lol
This is the most amazing map that I have ever seen
Will their be mods that go with this or is this just going to be vanilla and all that stuff you said about jobs is just post to be the player’s imagination.
Microsoft should pay you for help jesus christ, you are really passionate and talented! Keep it up!!!
OMG ITS SO AMAZING I CAN'T BELIEVE  YOU ARE PRO GAMER
This is fortnite
"Large Structures" "I paste in the ruined nether portal"    But I jest, can't wait for the full map, this looks really cool

This is insane
Is this on bedrock aand java?
No hate, but I believe the "wings" of the windmill point in the wrong direction. Just wanted to point it out, it felt a bit off to me because of it.
think about how long it takes you to build a house in minecraft survival or creative now compare it to how long this would take.
OMG UOU ARE SO FRIKING GOOD!!!! WOW😍😍
Notch...take notes
@watzee should play this on hardcore
I miss a graveyard
How will the ores spawn? U would have to manually place them cuz this isnt a naturally generated world
Good build
My favourite biome is the Tundra soo: "I'll watch your career with great interest."
Hello. I loved this video; and I'm asking myself how the hell Trixy increased his render distance on the timelapses so much; any1 having idea, please ? Thanks a lot !
Instant follower
this is so sick
wow this projet is insane!
I got BOTW vibes when seeing this video and I war right when he mentioned it.
you should also make a nether, with a border you can't get across
Mojang nerd people how this men.
this would be such a good adventure with my mates
But did you do interior.
Alright Mojang, get to work.
Me in bedrock Sad noises
Was this in survival?
I want to do such an amazing project as well, but I'm basically Minecraft's worst builder. Does anyone have tips on how to become a better builder?
Make for bedrock edition too
ok so, my only critisizm is the shape, i wish the map was more unique but its great
I was thinking about structures you could put in the mooshroom island, what about one giant mushroom dead in the centre as if it were powering the rest or rather, connected to them, I don't know though, this is ultimately your map, thanks for reading this (or not).
Did he really transform this by his own,wow
; hpw your computer tnt [\\hhtp minecraft \vstar com
Red dead redemption Minecraft version
İdea:   -Unique traps for each biome, for example;     A cage in the ground for the jungle, amazon traps     Room full of snakes for desert etc  -Antique creatures fossils,for examples;     Some bones will be out of the ground, we digger will actually see how big the creature is  -Farm stuffs,for examples;     Carts with oxcarts plowing the land attached to cows     Warehouses     Stables etc.  -Add Advanced Civizilation,for examples;     A place with 18th century design buildings     (Maybe you can make Egyptian civilization more advanced)  -Alien visitation signs?for examples;     A field with strange shapes from a bird's eye view  -Reference to other games, movies and historical events,for examples;     Kaer Morhen from Witcher     Alamut Castle(Hasan Sabbah,leader of assasins)     Throne from Game of Thorens     (Yes I know this is very hard bu thats a idea!)  -Add horrible places,for examples;     Add torture dungeon     Corpses in water or buried in sand     People buried under the sand (like Far cry 3)  -Bridges about to collapse between mountains(or normal bridges)  -Add a volcano with lava  -References real civilization,for exaples     Japanese style buildings  -Add Alexandria library(near the sea)   I try to write whenever I can.    And I saw a comment, I don't want the ideas there to get lost so I'm copying it here:  Luca Bermudez  Some ideas:  - A pirate ship-wreck that got impaled by a big rock-spike or something with a treasure map that leads to a cool treasure type thing - A huge tree in one of the woods biomes with and entrance with an underground layer that could be over-grown with vines or something - A cabin in the dark oak forest with some kind of secret layer underneath it - A HUGE cave with loads of cool stuff like ores or a modified spawner and maybe a little cave area where bats make their nests and an underwater lake I'm kind of in a rush right now so i can't come up with that many ideas
80 000 likes? More like ten times the amount 😂
If you would want some variation in this, you could make a copy and divide each biome with a river, and use the center island(the plains) as y'know.... The Center kind of like a tech hub for the people who were here long ago.... Of course, the center island part is just for if you want a story. Also, I have not watched the full vid YET but please add some ravines if you haven't
This is actually insane, the only thing that I don't like is the Church
Imagine if he does the Nether and End next.
what nhe doesnt know is that tese vids blow up and his likes 10x
How long did that took
Mr. Burns: Smithers, hop in the spruce roof!  Mr. Smithers: But sir!? Mr. Burns: I said, hop in!
Epic...😩👍
this is amazing …
*7:07* Bundled logs actually sometimes spawn there! Your ones are obviously much, Much better, though. Great job!
Bro that's a lot of hard working
Сорм что пишу не на английском, но ты некогда не думал создать мод который перерабатывает строения у тебя отлично получилось бы
I really hope there's a bedrock version of the download
TrixyBlox: This build is smaller than I usually build it. The Build: Larger than anything I've made
i would like to play adventure map on this world <3
80,000 likes 😂😂😂

If those are pillager outposts make a pillager village or base
It's about time Mojang updated villages like this by default.
Broooooo!! I'm gonna watch the series and then play it myself
:O
Look like cities skylines with box
Add different coloured trees pls
I really love the new trees style! Make more shapes of them, add sakura and different coloured ones pls
Join #Hermicraft

Is this in a mod or just for youtube people and can it be in a cellphone please 🥺🥺
just a quick question, how many days did this project took you sir? i am just curious
Can we all take a moment to appreciate the time and work put into this build and video? This is just absolutely gorgeous. It's an amazing sight to the eye.
Could you put it on the market place for free please
I am sooo gonna play this when it comes out
Can we download it
DRAGON SHRINE
YOOOOOOOO THIS IS EPIC
Does it remind me of something? Red Dead Redemption?
Everytime I see a video like this I think I can do it but then I need 1 our for a house and then I have to study
wish i could play this on xbox
Love your work
Okay this is a looooootttaa effort, im subbing
What interested me most was the use of stairs in building walls.
Oh man i wanna have this world in my server!
Can you give me this world file?

this reminds me of fable 1. Poggers bro keep it up
Can you make like a winterfell game of thrones castle in the snow biome?
Do the measa

i think you made a continent with 6 biomes its a little better than pangea
Little Question i know this isn´t going to be answered but how is the App called you use to make the map
Why there's no description to download this ultimate survival world i want to play this world
Bushes and boulders work wonders,  I throw them around in all my survival worlds
It's like a Skyrim map🥰
oh my god it’s your new most popular video  wow
Where r badlands
That's.. very big.
80,000 likes? Try 800,00
Right before you said that you were inspired by botw, i was like, wow i can almost hear the music from the kakariko village lol
The fanatical italian pharmacologically kick because gun hemodynamically approve till a abaft maria. spectacular, halting c-clamp
Can we download this map
It would be cool if once u get rid of pillagers near the village it will slowly turn to this
Not being rude, but can someone explain why one of his eyes don't have eyelashes 🤔
when the island is sus
first, how many gigabytes is this gonna be? second, you should customize the underground and the end/nether and for the underground you could scatter ores (nether too) and add a stronghold so its fully playable
Yoooooo! I cant even do one single house and you did all!!!! I really want to play it now..how to get the world:^ haha
Me: [looks at thumbnail]    Also me: *Amphibia flashbacks intensifies*
The near pyramid geometrically sneeze because jogging bodily whisper save a relieved mechanic. uptight, ultra rub

I wish I had this world
Pls map link

Do we have to pay for this map?
Will this be available to download on Xbox
I P Marie fro Impsmdriewmoo Fermi Oiesmir
He’s such a great builder
Yo! You can build Kaer Morhen from The witcher 3 on those snowy mountains
This guy is unbelievable!!
80k likes huh? How about 800k
with 1 million subscribers and 8 million views. damn, but this is truly mind blowing, the people who disliked must be INSANE, what is there not to like about this absolutely fantastic video? Keep up the good work!
I’m taking the anvil off of the quarry when I get this map
Minecraft is getting less and less lazy each day, bet that in 2211, minecraft will be so amazing
you should put ewoks in the jungle
I would've loved if it looked more natural instead of a giant circle but I guess the lore could reference a god who tried to make a paradise or something like that.
At the end u of the series u should do a whole video where u upgrade the stronghold,Ender dragon arena and the woodland mansion
Your so talented I’m surprised that Milan’s hasn’t hired you yet
What is That app that you created you map callled
THIS IS SO IMPRESSIVE!!! CANT WAIT FOR MORE! Here is some ideas: 1. A biiiiiig mine with dusty and old rail tracks  2. a vulcano 3. some Easter eggs that no one knows about
The amount of time and effort you put into this is absolutely insane and incredible. This is the coolest
I wish I could explore this world
Oi and don't forget to add caves and ores to the map if people are going to play it!
Is it just me to does that town look like the ones from the music videos
Awesome work! How do you a chunk of blocks from one place to another?
A viking themed Taiga biome would be awesome 😎
Speed?
nice
Omg I could never
If there is some kind of supervillain base, you should base it off the planned Germania mega city.
You should try to base the lore off of RetroGamingNow's and Game Theory's Minecraft videos. It would be very interesting.
A mountain that has a secret world full of monsters
Very nice indeed! Was actually looking forward to have the plains bio have a giant walled city as the main city in the kingdom :)
This is a good ass video
This guy basically created an entirely different game
Could you make a custom Nether in your world also an End city and Underground please it's could make story a lot more Adventurous!!!!!
Add dungeons underground
Minecraft please hire this man 🙇‍♀️
When I see the pillager tower in the snowy mountains, I can't stop myself from thinking of Muscle Tower
You should add a massive fortress on a floating island in the sky. Each biome’s big structure should hold a key, you will need all 10 keys in order to get into the sky stronghold. It should be filled to the brim with precious materials. And, the sky fortress should be disguised in the sky and can only be found by using a map, sold by a random villager somewhere in the world. The sky stronghold will not be easy to enter, loaded with dangerous mobs and a deadly boss. Plz use this idea Trixyyyyy
Make it like skyrim
Can you please build the island's from "inside out" that are in jenny's head (for example the family island)?🙃 Btw this is my favourite serie on youtube right now!🤩
The new Zelda game: breath of the craft
Mojang be like WRIGHT THAT DOWN WRIGHT THAT DOEN
Is it going to be free to download?
You are amazing and should have a build off with grian also the village works in the plains becuase you can make the story that the plains and mesa village trade so the mesa has food for their animals because they could trande with the plains
My created all of this by himself!?!? How isane is that! I buy a simple small house with a tutorial on YouTube and it takes me 3 days. Honest work deserve the likes!
Will you do the nether to seeing you remade the nether portal
Could you build a bar by the seashore of a dark oak forest?
You should create a mod of this where things are natrually generated the way you made them in this by random.
You should just make the obsidian treasure that you can get when you complete a special task in every biomes
WHAT IS THE SEED ME NEED WORLD
Are you going to transform the Nether?
Crashed plane, Indiana Jones reference, Greek ish build, dwarven mines and Huns
This idea just popped into my head so it could be really dumb... But, pillager outposts are obviously outposts, so where do all the pillager families live? I think a giant pillager city of sorts somewhere in the world would be really fun and interesting! Whether it's above or underground, then the outposts truly are outposts :)
This would be absolutely perfect for a hunger games type of minecraft event. Not like regular UHC’s, but sorta like everyone spawns in a different biome and make the best of their resources before heading to a randomly assigned biome (as in, one game it could be mountains that end up being the last one; next time it could be mesa)
What is the code for it
what program did you use to mkae the world
I wonder... What if for unblock an massive secret (or just a normal you choose since its your project) you have to find a specific item on each biome, even the nether or the End (if your planning to do them to)  I think that would be very nice ☺️  Damn im very late I hope you'll read my comment 😅  PS : sorry for my bad english
This guy deserves way more subscribers
Please work at mojang
Your my expectations and I'm my reality
Where can I download your world??????
Mojang needs to hire you
Imagine if mojang will add this
Im sorry but... 🥐
As you said, have other religious buildings in the other biomes. Like Skyrim where different regions have different mainreligions. Could make for some cool builds!  Also inspired from Skyrim, something hinting to a dark brotherhood kind of deal. A cult designed against players entering the island?
Woah
Which shader did he use?
Idea: theres this mod which allows you to be the village mayor add a town hall and you make some villagers work, that mod will fit well in this world there are priests, farmer, guards, butcher, and other ones i hope you see this :D  Edit: the mod is called "TekTopia" it fits this world so much i don't know if it works though but yeah goodluck in the next biomes
i wish i played java so i could download this ;-;
trixy: makes  everything in minecraft better looking mojang: *heavy sweating*
You should collab with JeraCraft
Does this map have a seed at all so I can try and do something like this too?
Will this world be able to play on Xbox?
dowload?
My minecraft world looks like nothing compared to the world you’re building.
You have our attention   now we're waiting for more
Genius
Will this be available on bedrock
Wonder when someone is gonna tell him that he has to make a full cave system beneath the whole map
Hi, I'm Brazilian and unfortunately my English is bad, so sometimes I didn't understand what he said in the video, so I came here to ask a question... Will the download be free, or will it only be on the patreon?
How you copy and paste???
too much time does this
"Get it to 80k likes" - *looks at like counter* - well i guess 10x the goal is enough
Just omg
He accidentally created Mata Nui lol
Imagine a mod like this
I hope there is also something like Atlantis.. love the map
What’s the seed
5:00 stones 8:20 fishing boats 9:40 fields
Can I Play this on switch ??
You should work for Mojang
10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000%10
Не стоит болтать так долго. Начинай сразу.
this is so cool! I will watch your career with great interest :)
everyone : is upgrade every thing my god damn brain : dungeon update
This is the second video I watched from your channel (and this series) and I'm blown away by amazing building skill. You put so much creativity and time into this and it turns out awesome. Maybe I can take a few inspirations for my own buildings.
What’s the seed
Where can download XD
This man needs to be hired by mojang
Are you gonna design the nether as well?
Do you have a download without the extra stuff?
Npc mod, opi weapon and armor,boss,war and kingdom
Try to put npc
Here’s a suggestion how about a small meteor in the snowy mountains that would be nice
But can you hit the edgebug on nuke tho

Bro you are a genius. I played Minecraft for 6 years, but I never saw something like this. Really good job
Op
That's impressive
When you ask for 80,000 likes ang get 800,000
A destroyed castle in the falater snowy area would be cool.
The libary in the village there i live was in the past the school. Maybe you could do something like this in over biomes by adding a school room to the libary
I wonder if you can upgrade nether and end dimensions cause that would be cool
I discovered minecraft during my primary school years. At that time, I was a really shy person. I only have a few friends, if not at all. Then, I found this youtube video about a game (Minecraft) with Taio Cruz's "Dynamite" song as its bgm (maybe some of you also knew this). From then on, I played the game and i instantly loved it. It helped me through my tough times and i made friends with a lot people along the way. I played it for so long until eventually I got busy with my other activities, so I kind of stayed away from Minecraft.   Currently, i'm in the end of my first year as a college student and seeing this video makes me very nostalgic. I really, really love this map and from the first minute, i already knew that this is gonna be epic. Thank you for unintentionally reminding me of Minecraft and I really hope that i can play your map with my old friends :)
Lmao the like goal has gone times ten
Lol
Wow your Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good at building in fact your a god I’m 8 bye
Fifteen thousand blox
19:29 that looks more like a church lol
Trixy: *GET THIS TO 80K LIKES!*  Viewers: *DID YOU SAY 800K?*
Are there mountains? -Edit nevermind.
Are you upgrading nether too?
It would be cool if u added a huge tree in the plains or in the jungpe liek from the movie avatar
Get this video to 80000 likes for starting the project . Literally everyone like , like , like . The goal got to its current within 1 hour !
Bet it. Took a year
You are amazing!
This is what minecraft is missing, a storymode/adventure/skyrim mode, this is so cool
Wish this mod will be ported on mcpe mobilr
How to play in this World?
can you make an link when your ready with the world that we can play it
Trixy: let’s get this to 80000 likes. Me: sees there are 810k likes. Me: LLLUUUUUUUUUULLLL
WHEN IS THE WORLD DOWNLOAD GONNA COME?!
When this map is finished, this would be a nice smp server map
I mean look at this, this is what I wish Minecraft was if you can do it Moyang can do it but they don’t
Will he also make a costum ravine nobody knows
Epic?!!
These villagers and pillagers are living better then me
Add a traditional viking village in the snowy mountains please with a jarl house a temple for the Gods and giant statue of the Gods
TrixyBlox, may i suggest adding slabs wether stone or carpets or bricks, and add some flowers with fences holding lamps on walkways, i think it would make it fancy at night and if you dont like he lamps i also suggest hiding glowstones under carpets..i just really love sprinting and maneuvering through slabs 😄😄
If you haven't already plz make the wandering trader and his llamas random shacks and houses around the world
where is the download?
Will it work in bedrock edition
This man would love animal crossing new horizons
Trixy: Let's get to 80 thousands Us: Oops we added one more 0 accidentally
This is sick, wish villages where actually like this
*Top 10 Users Mojang Was Afraid To Ban*
Can i get this map for my roleplay video in future
Wth
All the biomes lives in harmony, til, the desert biome attacked
Would be nice if the map was more natural
I want 80k likes  800k likes take it or leave it

Mojang please hire this guy ;)

Bah, 80k likes. I give you likes tenfold of your goal.

im speechless honestly im so impressed
so cool
u re nuts
Pause write at 6:53 and read the words he wrote at the bottom   Edit: .......EVIL
You should do a modpack with these structures
5:32 I actually found a naturally generated ruin of nether portal of this size or might be bigger than this in vanilla Minecraft. It was really fascinating and recorded it.
Maybe an upgraded big sized minecraft character would be perfect
Where is the seed or link to this survival world
the island is kinda shaped like a parrot's face
honestly epic, though the clerics wagon is too large in my opinion
Amazing bro just amazing and above
just make it a adventure map at this point
Axolotls with Gatling gun
I wish I had java edition, mostly for worldpainter. I love seeing projects like this, and I think it's gonna be really cool! used to have java edition, made something similar to this with custom commands and even cutscenes n' stuff but it was too small, and it never got finished. ought to do that again, actually.
Please let us play the seed
this map could actually become a minecraft server, where all players make their bases and passively socialize or battle for territory.
Are you gonna make it possible to download the world???
I hope you make the dragon and the wither part of the lore of the island and you (as the player) slaying it gives you more of a feeling of accomplishment
Instead of a Plains can you make like floating islands
man, this project is incredible
Build an abandoned mansion
You could make the jungle bium a tree house village belonging to a lost sivalishachion
i really hope its not a member only thing cause id really love to play this map it looks so cool
This is starting to sound like skyrim
Dear god......PLEASE let this be free to download and not a patreon exclusive!
So much coarse dirt😭
Wow
where the swamp tho
This thing is awesome dude , just like how?
what im worried about is that if i play it my builds will look so bad compared to these beautiful structures. nice work trixy
I would like  to play this map when u finish new suscriber
KK ADD MODS FOR VILLAGERS
This is soo good jrhfhncfh like it’s so impressive I’m actually speechless ima play an smp with my friends when this finishes so good luck
Sometime i wish i could be in the head of the ones that dislike these videos, do they dislike it because they think its useless to spend so much effort and time into a videogame? do they just dont like the creator? and if its that, why? or maybe its just because they are jealous that they can't make such beautifull structures.              or maybe they just don't like Minecraft... and in that case, THESE HERETICS NEED TO BURN!!!!!
So be honest I am amazed at people ability to be creative and especially you
80,000 likes, gets 800,000
You should do shipwreck
alternate title: “building hyrule in minecraft”
Hmmm, that’s strange, where is your hermit craft invite?
How can we play?
This kinda reminds me of red dead redemption 2
Well the village is missing management. You should buid a building for a Bailiff or some Noble who run stuff.
you should add in meatiors in big craters that have crashed on the world! Also, I really intend to play this when finished!
When you watch Aphmau be like:  "Omg it's starlight😯"
I'd love if this was a mod that replaces the world generated structures, that would seriously be awesome!
Are there strongholds?
Just WOW
i want to live there so baddd
you have to work for mojang, wow
Wooow i love your buildings <3
Do you have eyelashes on your left eye and none on your right?
Just as a suggestion, you should make all the flags that you build blowing in the same direction as the clouds. I noticed this as I was rewatching the pillager outpost part.
You got 10 times 80k
wow i am intrest minecraft need to hire him
Undetground?
Thing is... This was by yourself. Amazing work. Amazing
I wonder where you'll spawn when you load up the world. Will you spawn in the center? Or will you spawn in one of the many biomes?
Would you isekai into this world if it does not look soo blocky
Map .mcworld
Pls link to download map
Man I rlly wish minecraft would upgrade their structures...
He deserves all the subs and likes
Bloody
Im wondering what about spawners amd caves？
Is it just? me or the church for plains looks like a Church from a Anime Church thingy mabob?
can you make a minecraft map download for this IT LOOKS EPIC
No hate… but the roof on the outpost kinda looks like a bald cap
Download lino please 🥺
This is too good
You have too much time on your hands.and when I say time I also mean talent
the pills get outpost kind of reminded me of clash of clans especially when you added the archery towers
hey dude id really love this map if its done  could you send a map link? bc i also love breath of the wild this seed is very like it
I loved it until I found someone trying to do it like in twich and could not 🤣🤣
The legend of trixy, breath of the world-edit
Damn this is so amazing! It reminds me of Genshin Impact! Also I really love your wholesome builds
This all look gorgeous, but I think some hills could help break up the monotony of the plains. Not big hills, but small mounds of dirt scattered about, or even an area that is a bit more uneven than the rest
TrixyBlox: I'll finish this map if this video gets 80000 likes  The internet: You forgot a zero...
Does this world has end portal
You could make a Minecraft diaries like aphmau 😆
and this is something i never expected you, without even trying made the cyan logo
Which shader are you using?
I would pay for this map! 🤑
And sadly i dont have a pc
Ohhhhhh your the underground kingdom guy i saw idk how long ago
Why does the map look like wano from one piece
My man wanted 80000 likes, he got 800, 000 and counting.
I think this dude is not a human...       He's a GOD!!!
This is so cool.
how long have you been building it all?
So cool! Idk if i want to play survival on this but ill check it out in creative for sure.
swamp biome :(
WAT WOW
The map looks like Starlight wonderland (iykyk)
You should send this map off to forge labs and he might play it in a YouTube vid
pause at 6:52
I really wish this map gonna get official mark from Minecraft and then someone play this game just like other popular game like The Forest or other...   I havent seen any game that can match this map
Lmao😨🍸
You should make a faction’s world for PS4 I’d really enjoy that
Mojang need you
Where is the Download?
i want to play this map
ROAD TO 1 MIL LIKES
he want's 80k but got 800k likes
Has Hermitcraft hit your dms yet?
You just friends from a village to a mega village that is very cool you must've 1 trillion likes
Mojang just hire this guy to make your in game structures
build a pipe organ inside the cathedral
What I would like to know is how much time did you invest in this awesome map.
jesus christ my holy lord THATS GOOD
imagine doing the nether as well
I think it would be cool if you had like a factory that builds iron golems and it has stone masons and black smiths
Amazing
2:52 the fact that the area is just plain snow , i really wanted to be in that world and just walk around 😆
Finished project at 13:31
I have an idea, now I’m not pushing you to do it. But you could do a second one but in the nether. Like when you open the gate to the nether (the humongous portal) you will find yourself on an island in the nether with all the nether biomes.
Alternative title: Creating Minecraft, better than ever.  (Where I can’t play yet because I don’t have Minecraft. :’] Sad.)
And a working rocket to take u to moon
There should be nasa
can you play this in a laptop?
You deserve atleast 5 mil subs for this, i would never be near that. go on bro
How are we going to get birch
No birch oooooooooooof
You better do ice spike      JK no threats lol
How do i get this map free  ?
what shader/ resource pack do you use
he asked for 80,000 likes he got 800,000
The delightful curtain radiologically fear because throat experimentally encourage than a melodic hospital. moldy, garrulous rubber
This is amazing
This process looks and feels like Skyrim
80 thousand likes  community you mean 800 thousand likes?
I think it'd be cool for like a tree design put the world tree in there
If I'd get reincarnated inside this world map I'd be satisfied living without internet,tho I'd probably die in the hands of a psychotic player..
plz use some of the new 1.17 blocks like amethyst crystal for witch theme
E
This with the tangotek villager mod.
I like how you made everything is this an app.. I want to install it.. because I like the trees that you make and everything...
what did you use to make the map?
Add a cave in the Snowy Mountains.
Someone like Black Plasma Studios needs to use this for their animations!
OK, why does everyone keep calling unmodded Minecraft 'vanilla'? I don't understand the reference here. Can someone please explain?
*I’m not gonna make it to crazy* also him Makes a giant everything
Put a dragon in the new Minecraft server you made please other dragon please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please please put on Minecraft dragon dragon dragon dragon dragon dragon
You should build a Zelda Breath of the Wild inspired world!
You are very good at building! Wow
Crosiant
I wanna see someone set up some story lines and quests for this map and basically turn it into skyrim
i MiNed A bIt oFF CamErA, oNLy gOt a fEw MaTErIaLs.    Jokes aside this is sick and I hope I can play it when it releases hope ya finish soon.
What if Grian did 3rd life season 2 in this world??? That would be so epic! XD
Okay I am loving this series
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW "EPIC" OF IT IF I PLAY WITH MY FREIND SOME EPIC MOD IN THIS ULTIMATE MAP
Retreat the butterfly house from the anime Demon Slayer
him: 80k likes   us: 800k take it or leave it
Damn your good
This is like an entire RPG.
LOOOORE
Also build a boat house
Can I have a link to download the not made map like the map but no stuff just the land
9:33 you should add animals
This is amazing, youre an artist
Do you plan to do the nether and end for this world?
But if you finish THAT portal, will it work?
TrixyBlox: lets go for 80,000 likes  Community: you get 10 times that
What Minecraft version would this map be in?
80k like? Minecraft community: did you mean 800k?
It would be so bad to have any regular sized and decorated Minecraft house in this world because a villagers house would look better than yours
"I'm just going to make some minor changes" Proceeds to completely redesign everything.  This is really cool, ill probably download it when it's done
Omg there should be a catacombs that connects all the biomes
Can you make something like hateno village
Are you going to do the nether?
So much respect for Minecraft builders, You guys are so amazing.  Respect 100
When it is done
How can u down load it?
“ I based some of it off of Zelda.. “ THIS IS ZELDA BREATH OF THE WILD 100%! 200%!!
Nessy in the water
As a member of the minecraft community, we need to get this man to at least 2 mill by 2022
how tf are you so good at building?!? you are in a league of your own
...INSANE
if one person could do this, what could Mojang do if they used the full potential of minecraft?
Forge labs watching this be like: 👁👄👁 oH nEw ConTeNT
yep definitly new sub u amazing man
This is a reuploqd
Mojang, please hire this guy
I can’t wait to see how the nether would look
You should add a collapsed part of the mine in the Mesa where you could add a diary
Good stuff mate.
How many days you did this?
Please make it available on bedrock aswell
One of the most relaxing Minecraft videos
You need to get paid by mojang
Wow.....you should start developing your own games at this point.
You should make a mod for the world. That have better viligers with quests and so on
Why are you this good? I don’t think Mojang could do any better
swamp?
i thought it was clickbait      i was very wrong
Add a place like Isengard or Gondor
I would FUCKING love to see this on Xbox.  Also, my suggestion is simply, remodel the nether to fit this same level of dedication.
800k likes gg
where is the world?
so basically mc but with lore
80,000? MORE LIKE 800,000 NOW! Seriously, this is a huge project and I’m so glad its going good! I’m so excited for this, and its gonna take so long! But, I’m not gonna get sick of Minecraft any time soon, even if it takes years. Love your work man, you have so much support behind you! <3
80 thousand likes? times 100
If anyone is looking for something similar to this check out Drehmal Primordial. I HIGHLY recommend it.
seed i beg u
Planins vegetables bois eat fish so not vegetables bois
Upgrades, people. Upgrades
I wanna see him do a challenge where he has to build something without world edit.
A turtle head looking out of the water from the North Sea would be kinda funny
Mojang Studios Should hire you
this should be the new rust
he wanted 80k likes he got one more 0
Bro the plains biome mind blown
Oddly enough, I once encountered during a ruined portal almost as large as the custom one. Well, not almost, but it got decently close.
Just an Idea for the plains. Wouldn't it be cool to have some kind of nobels?
tek topia would be good for this
Yeah, good luck speedrunning this.
Map plsssss
The island looks like wano from one piece
After ur done with this project, can you please build Zelda breath of the wild map???
Any old school bionicle dudes in here…the island straight up looks like Mata Nui
You should build a castle, pirate ship and a temple
800k let’s go
please put it to download the map please!!!
Can you leave a download of the plain world and/or with no custom structures as well?
Island looks like a thick Voya Nui😅
How the anvil floating  ??
You should have a pillager main base in one of the biomes
God, cant wait for a good lore!
1:30 what is app?
in the mines, there could be a hint that there was a monster deep inside the mine, and that they had to abandon it to not die, and then after a long and complicated puzzle, or anything you want really, there could be a wither, either free or stuck in a cage where you can challenge it
Ok who tf keeps disliking this man's vids, like bro he's a legend, building insaine stuff in minecraft, how could you hate this man
asks for 80k likes gets 800k lmaoo
The shaky fear immunophenotypically shiver because brick biomechanically mix pace a plain canvas. addicted, childlike mandolin
Hey man, small may be difficult but it is interesting some of the stuff you can make. Even something as simple as choosing birch over spruce could make the area completely feel different. It's mostly thematics that makes the difference.
How do you play it
Pillager outpost is sick af
Estos videos me facinan, ideas: Aste unos templos y estructuras en ruinas en la zona de Jungla
A ‘quaint windmill’     Yeah ok
should also add swamp
I can think of some mods which would work perfectly hand in hand with this incredible map…..
Maybe you should make a quest for most of the biomes. Like in the snowy mountains the quest could be finding Bigfoot's cave. After you finish a quest there could be a reward, like a loot chest. Can't wait to play this map! Keep up the great work.
You make your vids way too short bro
But how
Mojang should hire this dude to create structures in the game
Thats pretty cool
Please....please make a real underground DUNGEON with traps, monsters and loot
When he mentioned that he took heavy inspiration from breath of the wild (as he should lol that game is gorgeous), it gave me an idea, what if someone were to recreate the entire botw map in minecraft? How cool would it be to be able to traverse places like hyrule castle, zora's domain, death mountain, etc in minecraft?
Is this on Java Edition if so I cant wait for it.
I have always looked for a map that made me live an adventure, I think this is what I was looking for
dude, 1. my computer is gonna crash 2. my survival house gonna is gonna look so bad 3. still gonna play it
Can't wait to survive in this world
This made me speachless but something i think u could do is make this a map with mods someone who does mods is nr cray fish and u guys could make this like a rly cool map
Imagine getting this world for play in survival mode
Now I want you to recreate the temple of time 😂
Bl a ce weep ol s Oak
Imagine this in VR Minecraft
minecraft what it is. vs minecraft what it could be
How much do you want to bet that this is only gonna be for Java?  *Cries in Bedrock*
how do you download it???
dude this guy is literally the best builder i have every seen, its crazy.
just wow🔥
Whoa Already most Popular Trixy blox Vod ur Crazy
Im not suprised if someone called you the CEO of making things big.
He made minecraft so much cooler but harder XD i love ur vids im practicing on building stuff like that, but tbh i dunno about all that editor build stuff so can anyone help
Download a zombie modpack and make a map and try to survive on hardcore for 100 days WITHOUT DYING.
Me attempting to speedrun minecraft and found a broken nether portal with obsidian and without crying obsidian: im so luckyyyyyy Me seeing trixyblox’s nether portal and how many crying obsidians he placed: bruh. Me seeing so much cool structures but when you open the loot theres just 14 pieces of string, a saddle, and and a stick: wtf Me making something like this that doesnt look cool but has so much loot in a single chest and posting it to tiktok: this is gonna go viral than yours XD (i’m just joking i dont oppose any hate to you i love ur builds ❤️
Where is map
I wish I could play this but I'm on ps4 😞
Bro u r absolutely insane in building and u have so much of creativity ... Cool 🔥🔥
yooo this is so cool i wanna play that
Mojang should hire you! This was very awesome to have this in a hardcore world
IV bean wating for the nexed Vidio to pop up in my subscriber notification box for 4 weeks when is the nexed one
You know, it would be super cool if the mushroom island had battlements for bowmen/canons, so that whatever villagers who lived there could defend themselves against the nearby pillagers.
THIS is soo cool☀️👌💻
this gave me so many ideas for what to build with my bud!
Did you use world edit?
Ardonia just got jealous
"And what do you do in your free time?"
I hope u get work at mojang
its already 796,000 likes its 10 times more then you wanted when is the part two?
WHEN IS PART 2!!!
I just want to play in that world It's epic
Amogus   when the map is sus
Can't wait to see the other biomes
Hey you should improved the mob spawner!  Looking forward
Cmon guys put it to 80,000 likes wi mean who wouldn't like to do it?,🤔
In my opinion I think you should add like this giant helicopter on the circle infront of the plains connect with a bridge if this is like private island type .
Ngl looks like Horizon zero dawn lol
i want to play this when you are done to see the story and experience it myself, and since you love doing big builds i realise your'e going to make the woodland mansion ginormous.. but still it'll be extremely fun to play on this map!
Trixy - "Make sure you get this video to 80k likes" Fellow fans - "Rookie numbers..."
Pov: u clicked after many recommendations
can you pls add to the build, the doomsday device from fortnite PLS, subscribed and love your vids
Revival of mc adventure maps?
mojang: how the fuck did he made better than us ?
You are almost gonna get 2 million subscribers before the world download😃😂🤣
Honestly, with theright mods this is pretty much an early release of BotW 2. Just add some floating islands in the sky and it'll become the definition of perfection.
Why is the mushroom island small
I hope My videos hasn't Discover yet
I literally can't escape AMOGUS 1:25
How to download and when it will be available for download plz reply anyone who know
This is probably your best video in my opinion
I wish I could build that good
I watch this video 6 months ago
is their a part 2 /??????? i need to watch
Add a gaming zone
*I see this island on reddit)*
Wow thats cool i want to make a world but where can i downlaod the world painter in android pls.
Please dont forget swamp :'
You should add ice spikes or ice caves beneath the island sense you ma it 2x bigger
It always boggles me... why are the minecraft developers such bland builders?
I won't to play so bad
So excited for the rest of the series!!
I have a question. Will this be able to be downloaded on Bedrock edition for Xbox one?
Wait.. so that cobblestone tower was supposed to be a Church? Lol i thought that was a watch tower
OSM BROTHER
When are the next biome vids coming out??!!
Hire this man please. Make him the head mapper
I-It's beautiful! I love it!
My dude just basicly made an rpg map

link for bedrock plsss
Gg
I automatically subscribe when i saw this video, hope i can play it when its done!
Me every time I see one of your builds: I wish I could build like that!
Could you show us your builds without shaders? Maybe a short clip of it without them.
11:22 what about umm idk the Wandering Trader??
I like u build indian castle and village
Trixyblox i love ur vids how can u do that amazing im a fan of u u are only 1st. Buillder I LIKE EVERYBUILDING🤗
its look like wano kuni
I don’t wanna be that guy when you’re creating such an amazing work. But is the nether gonna be transformed? Or like end as well?
Me seeing the map that is not geographically accurate: BLASPHEMY!!  Also me: TAKE MY MONEY
Finally a Minecraft village I’d actually want to live in.
80k for all this wtf!!!!!!!
Pls tell me that dose not look like the old map from fortnite. Just a little not much.
Its just too beautiful
UPLOAD THE MAP 🎩
I don't know how he does it.
¿Cual es el progama con el que edita el mundo?
A secret cave or such that leads to a hidden fantasy world? O.0
This wants to make me buy Minecraft even more
Yo how do you build like that?
Just a month later and you have half a million more subs. Wow
Downloand?
Downloand?
I Wish we bedrock players will able to download this awesome map
where is the download?
I would love to see some aztec architecture in the jungle i think that'll be really cool  Maybe even some inca buildins aswell
I don’t understand why vanilla mincraft can’t be like this
Ice spike biome somewhere in the back of the mountains would’ve be cool
IT WoULD BE AWSOME IF YOU OR SOMEONE ELSE MADE THE PROFESSIONS ETC (the code)
Go for mor detail (grass, stone clusters, more tree variants etc). And PLEASE Upgrade the caves and **maybe** add new structures
If only I had the patience to do something like this.
The legend of Minecraft: Breath of the Wild
When it's finished, I want to play in there omg, gorgeous! :"D
Imagine adding RLCraft to this map and acting out your own game of thrones or lord of the rings with the main/central continent as the heart of the world and all other things being problems and false gods and attempted usurpers to your homeland with you going out to fight them and bring back trophies of your victories over them
Amazing.
Trixyblox: a quaint windmill. The windmill: bug and gorgeous
idk if you already thought about this but what about the pirate ship?
Mojang needs to hire this man
...i don't know what to say! 💜
I'm 20 why is this so fuckin interesting
9:32 mega ultra satisfying
Is it just me or is there a big rdr2 vibe
Make It public, please
Add a subscribe sign on a side of the mushroom island
Pls give this world to download
Bro ur hard work is godly impressive. How are you going without being lazy. Big :0
This is İNSANE!!
Can we get this on ps4 or xbix
WHERE IS EPISODE 2 IVE BEEN WAITING FOR 4 WEEKS!!
Dude your so cool I love you work it inspired me too work harder and keep up the amazing work.
seed?
some ideas:  - A village of Native Americans could be pretty nice in the savanna biome  - The Heart of Nether - a sky island or a sky castle where could be the wither boss - The lost underwater city of Atlantis or a sunken ship - A deep cave that goes to the end  - The Stonehenge  - An enormous waterfall that can hide behind some things
You work so hard on your vids than are amazing
Bro those villagers have a better house the my 2 year old survival world
this will go down as one of the greatest vanilla survival maps of all time...
the most satisfying minecraft vdo I've ever seen <3
gg bro
9:41 I don't think a stone wall around a field makes much sense Most fields have/had max a meter high "walls"
8:07 to all builders watching: winding pathways make sense *only* when they match the terrain like it does here. Paths are created by walking the quickest way from point A to point B, so they're gonna round all obstacles, but if the ground is flat, the path's gonna be straight.
MORE, WORK HARDER, C’MON ( i love it )
Bro... I know you do it with regular Minecraft youtuber style and I respect the use of wood, but cobblestone is definitely NOT cage like xP
Thast gana blow ypur pc 😂😂😂
Dude, you should add some custom dungeons. That would be sick.
Suprise suprise: people are most creative and productive when they don't have to waste time on earning money by doing something not creative.
Trixy: make sure we get to 80k likes  Me seeing 791k likes
This is amazing! But... The only concern I have is that there might be WAY too many mobs on the map
*80,000 LIKES for part 2* .... 80k no 800k =]]
I need to download this
Minecraft will never die and it’s because of legends like you. Thank you
Nice video, love the map… could you make a video if you finished it to show how we can get in
Can you make Epic Castle on mountens
Maybe do a Viking theme in the snow biome and make a worshiping place for Odin
*“80 thousand likes”*     Minecraft Community: *“792 K, take it or leave"*
This is ....
A viking fishing village would be awesome
Can't wait!!
please please please please please
Ples! Give me this map link
lol bro how much time did it take? its totally worth it👏👏👏👏👏 this would make one heck of a map you build (speachless)
Woah sick!!!
Ultimate
Holy fuck I am definitely subscribing
8:37 quaint???? You and I have very different meanings of the word quaint. Well, this is coming from the guy who made his world 2x larger so it makes sense
Trixy: If we get 80k likes I’ll continue this series… 791k likes later….
Forge labs should play on this map
U wish 80k like  We give u 791k like
It reminds me of something... Oh, of course, the Lampaclima island
Can you play this world on mobile?
Lol me and my friends will make countrys and start arguing for the middle territory
Wait a damn minute! WERE THOSE VERTICAL SLABS
I've never subscribe this fast, thanks to your creation
If this was me i would be suffering   You deserve to shine  =v=
if the home of viliger be like this 10:30 my home how will be ?????,
5:32
Thx so much you have inspired me to get better at building
Idk who the hell would dislike this video
Now this, puts a smile on my face
Youcan fly in survival nice :b
I will try my best to play this even tho it’s not available
I was but to comment this makes me think of Breath of the wild and then he said he took inspiration from it lol
I bet in snowy biom theres a secret base with powdered snow 😃
How can i download this
when part 2 jk its amazing but I want part two pls give me shout out if its desert next
Holy shit is GREAT  Can't wait for the other parts!
mabe abandoned viking village?
How are you so good at Minecraft like I can barely build anything and you made this like just wow even with just watching just the plains but it’s so impressive
why cant minecraft have updates like this
The ill-fated tip family push because rain regrettably zip but a measly enquiry. conscious, cloistered wall
80000 likes for a part two  *Gets almost 800000 likes*
Please send download link
Mojang Studios: i fear no man but that thing  Upgrading EVERYTHING In Minecraft - The Ultimate Survival World!  Mojang Studios: *it scares me*
E P I C
Hey I’m new to your channel but I am already hooked! 🪝 Two videos in and I’m impressed. This has been the best builds I have seen for a Minecraft MAP 🗺. I hope to see more!
Why does this guy's left eye look like it has makeup compared to his right eye? o_O
Can't wait to be fully immersed in this Minecraft world! This will have naturally spawning ores right?
Oh.my.gods. Did this take a century?! Dude you have closed my mouth shut right now I’m speechless
How do we download this mod
I love these biomes.
This is gonna be awesome will definitely have to play when it is done
Absolutely amazing!
plz do another vid soon
Bro you are a f*cking god
I got an idea with the new updates new biomes get added inside of the regular volumes that you added but only the ones that would fit together like the planes at the aquatic update well cuz they're very close to the ocean
You should include a sky island
Dude this map is so lit. Imagine this was actually minecraft. I would play for hours
This just reminds me of Catan
i personally think the village could have more houses though... As much as i love the looks, i just dont think the size of the buildings matches the size of the village. Very hyped to see this world finished
i want this map for download XD
We now a programmer to make it true.
if this is a downloadable map when it's finished, i wanna play it but with pixelmon and other mods :) it's really cool and i love the design i wish i was HALF as good as building as you.
PLEASE DO MORE THIS IS AMMMMAAAAZZZZINNNNGGGG
where is the rest 😔😔
Will the map be free?
You have the world's most powerful pc
I have some ideas: - Some llama carts for the wandering traders (if the wandering traders ever get tired of walking long distances) - An oasis in the desert with some palm trees to give a little bit of life. - A log cabin in the spruce wood forest. - A cave to the stronghold - A gigantic abandoned mineshaft with hidden secret diary entries found in minecart chests from a miner who got killed in the accident that caused the miners to abandon the mine. - A lair that once belonged to the ender dragon before she became the boss in the end dimension. - A shipwreck found on the beach which might have some backstory about the player arriving on the island. - A spider's den underground - Some abandoned watchtowers scattered around the world. - Some campfire sites with some tents in the forest. That is what I can think of. I am writing this late at night, so I am gonna need to go sleep soon. EDIT: I have 3 more ideas: - Some construction cranes and log cutters in the forests. - An inn in the plains biome for passing travelers. - Maybe a pyramid? Welp, those are my ideas!
you are my hero, i would love to play this map.
Wow you is a best 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 Sou brasileiro
"if the video gets 80,000 likes ill release the map" *ONLY FO PATREON*
80 k you mean 800 k??
Holy crap. You've got amazing ideas
Add some sort of Zelda themed dungeon since you seem like your a fan of that franchise
Holy shit I can't wait
This was so satisfying to watch! Can’t wait to see the next one, I don’t know if you’re open to going back to an area but a few gravestones might look good in the space to the left of the church ☠️
Some ideas:  - A pirate ship-wreck that got impaled by a big rock-spike or something with a treasure map that leads to a cool treasure type thing - A huge tree in one of the woods biomes with and entrance with an underground layer that could be over-grown with vines or something - A cabin in the dark oak forest with some kind of secret layer underneath it - A HUGE cave with loads of cool stuff like ores or a modified spawner and maybe a little cave area where bats make their nests and an underwater lake I'm kind of in a rush right now so i can't come up with that many ideas
When’s the next part?
MOJANG PLEASE INVITE HIM TO YOUR COMPANY
Use the epic combat mod
I hope you do post it to the public
I can build this. but It would take decades
TEACH ME HOW TO BUILD THIS GOOD
you go put world for download?
brazil here 🇧🇷❤️
definitely had the legend of Zelda breath of the wild vibes lol
Just marvelous
waar ik deze kaart download, wil ik hem op mijn server. Wat als de geodes, koper, geiten en al het materiaal uit 1.17 worden gegenereerd?
WOW!!, keren beudd
Plzzzzz Mojang add this!!
Can you apload the map please?? I love your video
He could definitely win every mr beast build challenge
Mojang should hire people like you and Jeracraft
Can't wait to play this
The legal column typically surround because fir preclinically coil next a curly dipstick. adjoining, tearful crop
Is this for Minecraft mobile to ?  My PC  need update I can't play with it now 😐
This should be what actual minecraft spawns should look like.
Im not sure if you work for minecraft but     Notch should really hire u
How can there be dislikes? Clearly it's a Lot of job and hasn't said anything to anyone
IP please
Amogus
HOW ARE THERE DISLIKES
Will definitely be playing this when it comes out also I hope that I won't need patreon
that's pure talent
I already want to play the map with the plains biome alone. Can't wait for the next transformations
Suggestion for the Wildwest railroad add a derailed bank car that you can loot
OMG
*I N T E R A C T I V E* *D & D* *M A P*

potatos are the best thing to plant change my mind
11:40, the wandering trader: guess ill die
Bro you are legend ☺️
What a masterpiece 🌻❤️
Ow.. my.. SHHEEEESH
Did you done
Some criticism is that the church still seems too big, a bit out of place
Ok
Can you please make a link for it for free
I dont see how mojang is not contacting you to improve their game
Skyrim
That weird guy on YouTube   : Destroying vanilla map with nuke
Will there be a bedrock port?
Can you add secret hidden pets. Where you have to save them. Or have secret lost villagers that trade good loot.
If i found a village like that in Minecraft,i Will make that my village
Wow I play mobile 🙃, But THIS is actually the coolest minecraft build I have ever seen in my whole life! How long did this take?
You should put the stronghold under the island
Hi trixyblox i love the map  but can i download the map on pocket please
Image a revamped manshin
Wow! Thats look so nice
MOJANG HIRE THIS MAN ALREADY
This guy is reaaaaaaaaaaaaally stretching out the release of the part 2
13:30 finally
How does he move what he built
Add Hogwarts!!!!!
wow ! i can't wait to play this map
Immediately installed Minecraft after two years the moment I watched this video. I felt super inspired.
good job for this!
Meia um?
Mabey add a weather mod so you get tornados and weather for designated areas
Birb
this looks like the hyperborea map
8:58 😶‍🌫️😳
9:05

i would be so sad if my bf was better at building than me 😭😭
Add dababy convertible
can't wait to explore the whole map !!!! :D
A tower with a guard as a golem
Wow amazing!🤩🤩
My favorite is the snow biom
I would pay to play on your map, you deserve ten times the recognition you received for this project
This guy must be the new owner of Minecraft💯💯
Cost for play?😅
men i love your project !!
Yo I wanna play this now
just wow
The problem is you made the village too good. Now they have better houses than 99 percent of players
Yo wtf
This looks like a resident evil map but more blockified and friendly
You should include some monuments, one in each biome, having keys hide in then and if you find all the keys you open a big tresure or a map to the end
What version are you making this on?
bro this is absolutely insane i love it
This might be too beefy for my laptop but I’ll try to play 😅
Can you make more videos?? I loved seeing the plains biome being transformed
I would like to see you build Anor Lando from dark souls
And if the win mill acutely moved and the wagon moved would be cool
Wonder how long it took him
So will you add a modpack to download along with the map and will be for phone or tablet because I play on tablet and the people who made on the back of my tablet say onn.tm I don't know what that means
The villagers are endermen in disguise.
Wowww
Oh my god I’m so excited for this!!!
U should do a part 2 on this
Imagine making that In servival
Nice Work !
Since the beekeeper isn’t a profession and the map has story, I think that the player should  starts out as a beekeeper.  Don’t respond to this comment because it would reveal that I’m right or wrong, and spoilers suck.
This was right under a Danganronpa vid   If you don't know why I'm saying this, read the title
Can u make a cool  house in the plains village where we can spawn?
you make it SUS
I want to play this RIGHT NOW! Super excited to play through your work. It looks amazing so far
Asks for 80k likes gets over 700k
You could include a big coral reef
This look like Amogus
Do you want to do the underground part? Since the new update focused on this
add ship in in the docks
Looking epic so far, hoping to see more progress on other biomes!!!
I sure hope you published this btw great job
Can you give Vietnamese subtitles? so that i can understand your every word
you should build a huge skybase
The seed
dude your minecraft builds and carzy awesome
Well..... See how many ppl are wanna to see the next biome upgrade. 784 thousands like 👀
i only have 1 question and that is, when do you think this world i done.
oh my good its got almost a million likes
What I suggest you add: I’m sure you’re going to do this, but I was thinking ultra large mega shipwrecks like Viking ships galleons etc. based on where they are
Why don't the mincraft devs just hire this guy right?
Him: *making a mega survival world*  Me: *laughs* this is no longer survival, it’s a goddamn fantasy adventure
It's playable on PS4?
epic
Did you miss a chest for the nether portal-
Soon, there will be speedruns about this solving mysteries or something
This looks a lot like the wyncraft map. Just a lot bigger
I just found this channal: Soda Pets, and one thing immediately struck me. And that's how much she looks like you. I don't think she's related, but please correct me if I'm wrong
Minecraft should see it and having a partnership with you.Can’t wait for the final result
that song... I remember it... from LOFI GIRL OMFG
Lol he goes get this video to 80k and I look at the like count hopefully and see it’s at 700k lol
This must have taken almost a year
This should be the minecraft map
This should be sent to mojang
THE THUMBNAIL ISLAND DO BE KINDA SUS
Trixy: "Get this to 80 thousand likes."  YouTube: "LOL!"
Imagine doing all of this on your phone
The amazing lettuce specially damage because squash invariably strip afore a workable tenor. evasive, orange branch

Wheres the download link
The map, "covers 16000 blocks" and "spans over 4000 blocks".
I need to play this fr.

When you get to the Jungle do you think you could make it deal kind of magical and mystical? Like on the floor of the jungle can be where everyone does their shopping, and social things, you could decorate with multiple colored lights, like brightly colored orbs lighting up the jungle floor, and their houses and stuff up in the trees, bridges and stuff connecting each little house and you could use a more natural looking light, more warm colors. Just a thought but it would be really cool if you did, I'd imagine the people being very mysterious, very conmected to nature, and isolated but very social within their town. Just a thought, I love your videos btw. Can't wait to see this world complete
We Passed 80k!!! We're waiting...
I haven't played minecraft in a while.... When this is done, I'm downloading it and completing the game to 100%. This.. This is crazy! It looks amazing just from the world creation, let alone the makeovers! Damn! This got me so hyped up!

Hello, you should make a world generation mod or plugin where all your improvements are so the people who install this can have a much more interesting experience than usual. And can you please upload this beautiful map to download it?
WOW I TOTALLY CANT WAIT TO TRY THIS
It would be funny if you added the grinch to the hills in the snow.

some people's might get offended by this comment but your upgrads made the game 1000X better .
How much did it take you to build this amazing upgrade?
Can you download the world without the changes only the trees and villages and pilleger outposts.  Without the changes you did to them
is this world downloadable?
I am beyond excited to play this
Holy. Shit.
This seems so fun!! I played an RPG custom map not too long ago and I'm getting the same but more open world vibe! I can't wait to see how this goes 🖤
Hey man I was wondering if you have dropped the map?
You should put tons of pillagers and you have to take over each biome
not to be rude but whats up with your right eye
where can i download it??? :D
You did a really good job. Mojang should really think bout putting a new map generation just like yours.
Entendi nada kkkkkkkkkkk😂😂🤣🤣⁉️
*800k likes later .-.*
That shit look like the battle pass,,    It’s actually really fuckin cool though not gonna lie.
Any updates? This map would become immediately popular as soon he release it
Asks for 80k likes, gets 800k
pls add a stronghold
Do the custom trees respawn that way?
Minecraft: To The Oblivion
when the download?
TrixyBlox how did you get those self-built trees and stones generated everywhere? and how did you place the pillager outposts and the villagers villages in the world?
Can we have  the modpack?
4k times 4k isn’t 16k

I actually got a botw feel off this, then you said you were inspired by it haha, I really wanna play this when you're finished, hope this can be on bedrock but will see

OK. This is astonishing. But maybe, adding more huge mountains would be better. STILL, Fantastic.

I’m totally playing in this world after you’re done 🔥

Epic
Wano in One Piece???
Tried that once       Gave up after my 20th house
Will this download be free for everyone since it is the 1million special? Or does everyone have to pay still?
Where can one download this amazing build?
Wow just wow
The thumbnail kinda sus
I watched this video in full but I honestly don't want to watch the part 2 or more bc I want to discover each of the new creations myself when the download comes out
You should build a ravine or underground village
Build in the seed 2592, it’s an island cut off from a land mass by a ravine trust me you are gonna like it
Idea:biggest tree in the plain
I always see things like this and go oh I can probably build something like this with no mods and in 20 minutes and then in 20 mins in I finally finish 1 house and then give up Caz it all looks the same
cant wait for the next biomeeeee :D over 775k likes, when we gonna see the rest o.O
Whats the seed
This video is a 1 million subscriber special, it came out three weeks ago and he's already got 1.54 million subscribers!
.......
did you add the loot chest on the top of the pillager tower?
“80,000 likes” hahahaha.. haha.
80k likes more like 776k likes lol
Awesome, just awesome no other words
I wouldn't want to play survival here  Too scared to destroy the map 😂
I wanna playyyyyy
you can make a kingdom!
I keep on checking in every day waiting to see if part two has come out.
you can literally create ur own mods about upgrading everything, that would be great if its real
Please release the finished map on bedrock for all of us console players to buy!!
Beautiful too bad I'm on console
Hey, what is the world seed ?
I had to sub because this is sick
J
Is there a seed to This or not
GORGEUS. BEAUTIFUL. PERFECT. HUGE. xd
Everything about your ideas are amazing,  kinda wish you could transform the costum world map for minecraft pe too to be honest. because i wanna get taste of your dope survival map since i don't have a supporting pc for minecraft with that map
Are there caves?
downlaod lın knıgger
If this map corrupts ☠
What program did you used to crate the world?
I cant even describe how I feal just wow
Youtubers : i build something off camera
This is God-tier creativity mate
You are smart in your ways. I made a world. Now there is an ocean monument right there in the middle of the market.   I did not do well
Fantastic work dude
this looks so much like Assassin's Creed Valhalla
How long did it take?
I don't think you would be close to having enough time on doing so, but it would love to see upgraded dimensions.  The nether is 8 times smaller than the overworld so that is something to keep in mind
Imagine this with a nature and survival mod-pack :D
"I miscalculated, and made it 2x Bigger"  Me: I don't see how that's a problem
Where is the link lol
I want a GOOD creeper ( the creeper is a science expiriment by a mad scientist) who gets exiled from the creeper army and u find him on the plains biome and he joins u on your journey and also has a emo backstory.
THAT ALOT OF BOCKS
16M
Gimme da map
Just an idea. What if you can add these small obliesks that have End runes on them? And inside the obliesks is an ender chest that can either contain: 2 eyes of ender, 4 ender pearls, or 1 dragon egg? (This part is a bit far-fetched) and what if, when you open the chest, a message in the chat appears saying:  Good luck Traveler. With different runes cycling between each other at the beginning and at the end of the message?  Only 3 can spawn on the main island, but an almost destroyed one is on an island that is quite small and missable, but the reward is an almost broken Elytra. The message on the broken one just appears to be runes. Also, the end starts to leak from the obliesks like the ruined nether portals.  I hope this gets considered or even viewed.
Update this pleas
If its a 4000x4000 world than it should be like 16 mil not 16k blocks
when I play this my laptop is going to become hotter than the sun (best map I have ever seen)
That is pute talent.
Cool world
where do I get a world download if I can get one?
U should provide download link of this world
i would do this but i’m too lazy 😳
Where is the map download link?

I love this
Link download please 🥺
Can this be played in pocket/bedrock edition?
The talented volcano moberly time because temperature finally saw lest a itchy comparison. previous, unknown break
It would be great if you make a kingdom in each bioms, the kingdoms having different kinds of buidings,with casltes in each biome and one mega castle(like literally huge) making it like it rules on the other castles n kingdoms!!
Holy crap. Amazing.
This video has 7 million view's and probably 6 million's of it are not subscribed, is it that hard to sub? trixyBlox would have 8 million subs if people weren't this lazy

Do a viking theme in the taiga or snowy mountains eh? :D its rare to see that in minecraft nowadays and the nordic style really can be beautiful in the snowy setting.
Is this avaliable for bedrock?
How can I download this map and also can I download it on mobile?
That's so impressive how you can build such creative structures and the size of this project is just stupidly enormous! I am exited for the other parts being built and for the finished map!

Where can we download it?
"4000x4000 spanning across 16000 blocks" what does that mean? Is it 16000x16000 or 4000x4000 blocks?
Underground secret abandoned bunker with hostile mobs like zombies or  a dark evil castle with vampires , zombies and what ever you want
Just a tip.you could add mods so that the mobs and everything match with what you did.
Idea: you should make an underground civilization in the mesa biome like what if one of the mines hold inside an underground civilization there would be markets, houses, and a underground river that connects back to the small lake
*day whatever.. the people have 700k likes*

Maybe have the zombie village from like a fungus or something. Maybe also try to explain why endermen take blocks and why skeletons are there. Oooo maybe try to explain the creeper. Maybe like some biological weapon was used and the world had to start from scratch. While some people were mutated or something

So this whole project is basically Skyrim in minecraft. *awesome*
What is this called
eeekkk. i cant wait to play that world UwU. i like ur vids and ur building skills :D
Why did I immediately think of the island for “Bionicles”?
Would be cool to add a quest board for the villages and command block the trades, like, "Collect a zombie head from the old watch tower" and you go in there and then give it to a villager for some gold or something.
Totally subscribed inorder to get the map  >:3
Kinda looks like wano
You could put the village bell on the top of the church
The hurt deodorant chronically strap because cracker electronmicroscopically add save a medical day. insidious, wacky wrecker
Did you add a witch hut in any of the biomes or the piliger outpost
Add a gravity falls reference
How do you get here
This is absolutely incredible I can’t wait to play
Here is a quick idea, make small areas with sunflowers in the plains bioma for extra color
could you maybe add modded mobs or wepons like grappling hooks? that would be very cool.
when is the next video of this survival world?
Make pyramids of giza
Could we just have the Vanilla world? the one without all the story line. this would make a great group survival world!
JerraCraft 2?
what if Trixy transformed the nether in the survival world?  or am I just asking too much.....?
the pillager outpost made me think off hillichurls villages in genshin impact
This is crazy
Hi
why arent u working for mojang:(
When do you make part 2
looks like a typical RPG map, but is actually looks great and beautiful!
I'm mind blowen I'm so excited when u release this for download.
Is there a seed?
Maybe you could do a thing where in the different Pillager outpost they can have different colored flags or entirely different style builds to represent different factions they come from I think that would be cool
I think building a long tall skinny bridge across one of the ravines would look good for the Mesa biome. Like the stereotypical western sketchy ones
This is the perfect map for my mmo rpg
God: ... Also God:
How or when can I download the map
Me:builds a diamond house also me: looks at his build....
Gives me One piece vibes, add a small sky island and a sunken city and people will make there own adventures...
80k likes * sees likes * Lmao jokes on him , I guess
This is insane :D
it would be that much cooler with mods
It would be pretty interesting to add a large dam, for a towns water supply, maybe next to the mushroom island.
That map remind me of black clover contenent.
he should have put the trader in the travelling wagon instead of a cleric.
“I’m not going to make it too crazy”
This look like wano a island form one piece
Hard to believe you did this all by yourself. 👍 Keep up the good work!
Da nnnn that's really good idea can't wait for it good work Brooklyn I respect you
Java people: YES, IMA GET THIS A SOON AS IT IS DONE  Everyone else: :(

80 thousand likes ? Bruh this dudes sitting there with almost 800 thousand likes
Add a one only mod that can explore the entire map like the player, but when the player or any other mod will get in its way it will kill it
Can Mojang hire this guy
I can't wait until this is finished! I hope with new updates you'll keep adding more to it! (I also look forward to a similar transformation but in the nether...?)  This is super cool and super satisfying to see you upgrade buildings and landscape! It feels much more natural and inviting.  (Edit: you've definitely gained a new subscriber lol)

Oh my god, i need to play in that map :(
Am I the only one considering the fact that if you cut down a tree for wood and replant it it’ll just look like the normal vanilla trees..?
Is it possible for you to provide a download with just the terrain and none of the builds so we can try building our own worlds using your map?
Part 2!!!! WHERES PART 2!!!!!

You should work with hypixel
The western town could be named Hill valley, how about a frozen crashed UFO in the Arctic area of the map, Some frozen giant monster fossils, a murder mystery mansion.
Add a sasquatch in taiga biome
The map is so big Jungle trees look tiny
hi idk if you read your old comments but i'm trying to do a similar thing with a custom survival world. sadly the biomes are glitched and everywhere i go it thinks im in a deep ocean. is there a way to reset it or automatically have minecraft guess the biome? i really don't want to go through the process of painting every block to it's specific biome because my world is very precise and has multiple small islands dotted around
Umm it's been 2 weeks and the second one hasn't been uploaded
When’s the next video dropping I’m insanely excited
And that’s a sub :)
PLSS I CANT WAIT I WANNA PLAY ITTTT NOWWWWW

Man you are making Mojang look weak in building, but it is so good!
This is so cool it makes me squeamish, absolutely amazed 👏
i couldn't resist             i had to subscribe sorry haters
Maybe redesign the spawn in the End? Might be cool to go to the End from that evil castle you made previously to see what looks to be an insane arena of some sorts in the End.
How tf do u build so good man,damn ya good
Why does Minecraft map looks like the land of wano
Make massive tree on the center of the plains biome
Could you make a tutorial on the pillager base because it looks sick!
would it be on xbox?
Or maybe put together some  ideas from Minecraft Story Mode or Dungeons   Ex:  1. Illagers - Better Mansion  2. Nether - Better fortress and Bastion. 3. Ocean - Better Monument and much better shipwrecks   Pls leave a ♥️👍 (Can't wait 4 da MAP!)
over 700k likes im really lookinf forward to second part and download
You should make the pirate ship wreck a huge man o war with tons of treasure and maps or a map table. Maybe a floating flag near it maybe some cannons?           Like if you agree.
Am keeping my ideas for my cool game to only have in the world
Any update
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
You never tried to do something like this but survival friendly?(maybe without any shaders would be cool too)
I NEED ITTTTT
nice
Please tell me I’m not the only one who thinks the world looks like a parrot head.
Are you going to upgrade the nether?
I'm excited for the next part
I’m fairly new to this, but does anyone have any idea how long this project will take? TrixyBlox, do you have an eta on a v.1 download? This is beautiful and I’m losing my mind.
This is beautiful! I'm excited to see the rest of the map.
11:03 How´d you make the anvil fly?
Looks awesome!
Canes from jazzgost
whats the Seed
I have a question. Do you use any mods or mod packs? If so what are they and what can I get them on. Do you also use any shaders? Also what was that world designer thing you were using? If you could answer these questions that would be great
Dude I’m sorry to be the one to tell u this, but ur just a little bit insane 😂
No map download?
Damn
Its crazy to me that one person who has true passion can make the vanilla game look like trash. It is like if Bob Ross were to have a paint off challenge with an infant.
Come si creano le mappe?
Trixy Blocks: 80k likes His subscribers: how about we give you 763k likes
You said soon where is the next video
Can I kill and travel?
Wouldn't be cool if you add some Medieval castle , Medieval Outpost and if you can add some mod of Medieval stuff like weapons it would be awesome
Imagine what he can do with the next Updates🤯 the increased build hight alone would be enough😅
Wee need Part 2
I'm hoping that this might eventually be downloadable on console.
I'm afraid it won't work properly... Does the base of Pillagers really have natural Pillagers spawn? Does the Temple of Guardians really have natural Guardian spawn? Does the game really believe that the biomes of the world are really those biomes? Example: If I press the F3 button while I'm in Taiga, will the game say I'm in the Taiga biome?   I'm sorry if you don't understand something, I used Google Translate      Originally I had written:   Estou com medo sobre não funcionar corretamente... A  base dos Pillagers realmente tem spawn natural de Pillagers? O Templo Dos Guardiões realmente tem spawn natural de Guardiões?  O jogo realmente acredita que os biomas do mundo são realmente aqueles biomas? Exemplo: Se eu apertar o botão F3 enquanto estou na Taiga o jogo irá dizer que estou no bioma Taiga?   Me desculpe se não entendeu algo, usei o Google Tradutor
Is the world format based on Wano from One Piece?
This man made us mata nui
How to get this amazing world.
What about manshon
You missed a village part... The blacksmith
Cool
Ok but the map lookin like amogus
how ı can play thıs map
Can I download this map?
Hey trixy blox I wanted to know what is the name of your shaders pls tell
You should see what you can do about a city for pillagers, like a permanent city and not an outpost
This is too sick. I’m so sad I’m on bedrock and can’t play it
A stronghold but with  bedrock layer covering theostone bricks layer buried deep within the ground creating a lost ancient ruin kindda feel (another idea) with one entrance  the stronghold swarmed by monsters so once inside their is no going out make it like a maze normal cus stronghold are easy basically a giant maze stronghold in which you can't dig in or dig out due to bedrock have to use the entrance full of loot swarmed with monsters n the only way out is kill the dragon die or the entrance
the underground kingdom if you could get that place in there in the Nether you can add a forgotten civilization around the fortress in the End you can upgrade the End-City you can do your castle in the ocean just in site from the shore  a shipwrecked navy fleet have the zombie village you mentioned be reminiscent of a war zone possibly from a navel attack areas meant to be historical & or religious sites a forgotten mythical beast in slumber & or the remains of one a dragon or wyvern's den in the mountains rumors of a mysterious dark entity throughout the land maybe has a cultist following
the sus is pooping
So...this video is literally titled *"How to turn Minecraft into an RPG Fantasy"* and that reminds me of *AsianHalfSquat*  Meanwhile, Terraria players : *IMPOSSIBLE!*    Once this project is finished, one of you guys will add some shaders/mods and said *Aww...PERFECTION.*
Trixy would make a really good architect ngl
Pov: you are me and play on bedrock hoping for this to go into the store
Gosh those teeth are vile
There should be some broken wooden bridges on very tall mountains
everyone like the video so we can actually play that world
The chunks tho
This man is insane!!!
we must like this video
You should work for Hypixel for the build team to make skywars and bedwars maps, This is epic you god!!
Can i download that map? I want to download that map please can i download it and how?
Lol he asked for 80k likes and he got over 700k
Wow. New Genshin Impact is gonna get released.
Finally some thing amazing in Minecraft
Fast 800k like
were waiting for another episode
For the shipwreck you should make the titanic shipwreck
AFF tá em inglês
Amazing... I spent over a year just to convert a village by a tiny bit
creative mode..
What about building a woodland mansion?
really wish we could get the download of just the vanilla map
seed? or is it not done yet
I subscribed in the first 2 minutes and 52 seconds dude. This video is truly amazing. Keep 'em comin'!
i wish mojang add all that biome in 1.18 update
Have a download link
seed plssss
Dope
I don't know how you do it
why would you put a farm in the middle of the village
does anybody know if there is a map download?
Also dosen't mountains block things for a desert idk I'm not an scientist
This just reminds me of an croissant
Can we download it now? Please, I need to play his with my friends and family and to be honest it's perfect. I hope you let us download it
This would be an amazing map for a RPG.
HOLY OH MY.
You should build a city in the centre of the map
Where’s the second part?
Will this map include caves and cliffs update part two features, caves, and other stuff ??
Brilliant!
80k? Done we at 740k let's go
That thumbnail is kinda sus
Make a huge mushroom in the center of the mushroom biome.
It's a playable vanilla map we could add it in every version? This would be so cool!
You could also add dungeons and battle towers to make this like a rogue like. Also making better Bastions in the Nether as well as villages for Piglins. For the End, I’m not sure what you can do there to transform it… Maybe changing the main end island where you fight the Ender Dragon?
I really like this idea
just me or does he not have eye lashes?
You could also transform the Nether and End so it is the **ultimate** survival map 😏
Can u make it playable for bedrock players as well as java
One idea with the cleric carts is to have them all over the map, but have a hidden origin place for all the clerics. I'm thinking like a mystical "seminary" type school in the mountain biome where all of the clerics go and study and depart on missions with their carts, but it has a darker and more sinister feel rather than a happy "churchy" feel.
Why does Mojang not hire this talented god
What about the nether?
I wish this map is gonna be used for adventure mode because it looks like a lot about rpg game  or like the darksouls game I want this to be something like that hahaha
Download Map??
Pls do one block 100 days?
Really great but you forgot the ravines

Alright I got an idea in the desert try and add a dune worm in the sand (kinda like a boss or something) it's a refrnce from an old Roblox game and I thought it would be a good idea to implement in this build
add a dungeon which we can fight with different monsters and get some unique items when we kill them
I just loved how it is related to some rpg game worlds , soo impressive
Him: lets get 80k likes Us: nah lets do 800k

Homie went from 1mil to 1.5 mill in half a month
Rewatching this 2 weeks later as a recap for episode 2 hopefully coming soon
wait.. did he added a forge ? or im totally dumb :(
Suggestion:add a anchient city burried in the desert that is only slightly sticking from the sand and you have to dig up the sand to see the full city and find loot.  Btw i love your conntent byeee...
Is this Minecraft or red dead redemption 2?
I love all the biomes but the structures are to big and not so vanilla.
I suggest naming the map Gaia’s haven, as Gaia in Greek mythology is the embodiment of earth itself, and the map represents all of the key biomes in Minecraft
EPIC
All the cool stuff and then just " maybe even a Bob Ross reference..."
Did you mean 800 thousand likes?
I wanna play is so bad
We need you to collab with Jera 😩
My godness! It's absolutely gorgeous! Imagine adding a secret bunker in one of the biomes and fill it with malfunctioning redstone contraptions
Include a breath of the wild-style tower in every biome
OH IT'LL BE COOL IF THERE WAS A VILLAGE ON THE WATER
Add teleport beacons between all biomes with command blocks like Skyrim
Cool entrance and great flowers!!
Man you  will have a world record
If can you put a new respawn point for animals villagers pillagers and more to their new home?
Something cool he should add is a BIG and i mean reallyy big tree in the middle of the map and add treasures and stuff in it maybe even a village or something inside it
What version of Minecraft can this be downloaded into
Man really expects us to download this? Not everyone has a computer the size of a refrigerator
I feel like this would work great as an adventure map
where can i download this map ? Xd
Are there ores underground?
This is so cool, you put so much effort on this very swag man
will you upload the map without any build ?
Bro the map looks like Donald Trump's face (like as in the actual island shape, I was not insulting your building skills, the map is amazing man!)
when will the next part of the series will come out?
I’m sure this is Java so I won’t be able to actually enjoy this amazing project. 😭
Wooden mansions are diamonds mansions

How do i downoload this?
When i can downlad this map?

I can’t see this and not subscribe! Awesome job, I will 100% download
You should make a mod so that when a sapling grows up into a  tree in that world, it would use one of those custom models that you made.
Wow, just Wow
why not add a giant pirate ship where you can get coll pirate baste items sorry if i miss spelled i'm writing with a cast
Maybe add a Stonehenge type build somewhere in the plains.
Please give the link for download this map😂😂
A Sky island to the map please
Having an eerie Swamp biome, or at least a portion in the Roofed Forrest would be pretty cool. Could have a harbour town, destroyed or not that had/has a fishing based economy. You could make a little fish market, as well as a few other structures such as a library or chapel or even a graveyard to add to the horror theming. That reminds me, a witch hut would obviously be close by too. That could be relevant to the lore, maybe the old witch living in the hut could be the equivalent to the Boogeyman, the locals would tell stories of the witch to get the children to behave. It could even be an entire coven of witches! Also, as a little secret, there could be some mysterious monster in the water that the player could go hunt down, perhaps getting some rewards from the locals too. I don't know, I'm just spitballing here.
when are you going to make another video
Can you make the other biome pleaseeeeeeee
thats called minecraft
This is absolutely amazing. I cant wait to play on this map.
I think there should be small mountains to separate the plains slightly from the savanna and deserts.
Make a large fire in the forest that never ends   It resembles  a magical lightining made by the god of evil hit the forest
Build a giant mushroom in the middle of the mooshroom biome
Glacier off the coast of the tundra biome?
that map kinda looks like, AMONG US???
Btw 1.17 is gonna ruin yo life
Were waiting for the part 2
Man I hope when the map is out you release an hour video of you creating everything on the map it would be sick :)
Bruh thats the land of wano
You should make a huge tree in one of the biomes and make a magical city around it
OMG I'M SO EXCITED TO DOWNLOAD THIS 😍😍😍😍
Volcano Biome so you can have lore between The ice realm and the volcano land, like maybe a war
Man!!!! I want it now!!! I want to play it at this world so bad!!!! Thanks for letting me seeing this minecraft paradise
I'm also speechless and so exited to play that world!
Maybe you can add some mods
Hei, that's Wano Kuni?
Maybe you can make a bone yard full of big animal bones
Maybe new ores too
Maybe new Minecraft animals for your biomes
Maybe you can have someone code and make new Perfeshins for the villagers and pillagers and animals
A sunk ship
How long did all this take you?
This video is weirdly relaxing
R.I.P for the swamps
I NEED THIS AS A DOWNLOAD!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also, plzzzzzzzzzzz give me lessons on building.  In the snowy biome, can you make Hagrid's cabin? That's where the "monster" will live EDIT: Can u make another video, but you update the mobs too. Also, make it at least more than 30 min plz.
Can we have this on bedrock?
For 2 mil add mods

To be honest. I thought that the thumbnail was a picture of the fortnite map. 😂😂
can't wait for tribal villages having territorial war lore in your world! would be great to see more tribal villages with different themes
whatsssss part twooo
You could search for a mod that you can make an area turn into a biome of your choice, It would make the mobs of that biome spawn naturaly, that way the map would be more imersive.
What tool did you use to make the map?
bet the download will never come
When this is all done you need to do a lets play with some other youtubers or something like that itll be really cool
i would personally like to see a steampunk/dwemer(elder scrolls) inspired underground city of advanced technology made from redstone.....
wow thats amazeing
I had an idea that would be cool I think, in the dessert or any biome really, you could make a bone grave yard. So you’d have to walk through a huge rib cage and you could even incorporate a skull with the mouth being open as an entrance to somewhere. Perhaps It could be of a ancient animals like dinosaurs or mammoths or even dragons given how much you like to incorporate them into your builds. Just a thought I love your build btw you’re incredibly talented!!!
Breath taking I can't wait until this is finished nicely done
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa🙀🙀🙀
Challenge: Since your inspired by BOTW so much, recreate the whole map of BOTW in minecraft

LOVE the Biomes and Concepts! NICE WORK. Lets portal to THE UPLIFT! #bojax
after u finish it copy the island some where else on the server and make a ripp design on one of the corners and make a map of it that u can put on the shipwreck

What each biome’s religion should be so that you can model the churches:  Plains: Christianity Desert: Islam Jungle: Aztec Paganism Dark Oak: Bhudism or Hinduism Savannah: Native African Religions or Islam (either would work) Mesa: Christianity Snowy Mountains: Norse Mythology Taiga: Christianity

I showed this great vid to my sister. She said “🥺You need the T on the Church,😇.” Awesome vid!
Can you add a world download please?
GOOD LORD THIS IS AWESOME
I absolutely love this project and what you’ve done so far! I suggest that you smooth out some of the edges of the island and add some rocky beaches. I’m also always a big fan of giant mushrooms and similar magical foresty terraforming so I hope you do some of that in the dark oak forest and mushroom fields biomes. Good luck on this project and all future projects! I greatly admire your work and I want to do similar things in the future.
Wow. Can i just live in that world? Hahaha
i wish thou, the nether portal can have a bit more netherrack, it looks too bland

see you guys in a year there no ways it's going to hit 80,000 Likes,  anytime soon more likely going to forget about doing it soon as it hit it also I don't understand how there's so many dislikes is it because you have to be at Patron just to download the map when it comes out so it's not technically free??
PLEASE make it have enough resources for a survival lets play
Apk?
Also it would be cool if dragon nests scattered around the map
now imagine if he accidentally deleted it
You can put half blocks in the bottom of the water in your farm so if you fall in you don't have to jump to get out, which would destroy your farmland.
My soul just left my body from how amazing it is
Make another episode please
0:59 That reminded me one of the stages from The Hunger Game. Incredible job!!

Bro, you literally changed everything.  And not only me like this very much.
Day one  of asking for this add piglin village or a custom nether to fit this world and add diary of piglins for example.    DEAR diary,   Day 1 Skeletons demons cubes that spit fire what the heck happened it was just a portal then they arrived not only that the also attacked our troops with ferocious speed crossbows hurt the aerial troops but our legions get destroyed by those cubes we call them Ghast.     Day 2 They build strukchures but they also made the ground wierd dark dead and slows you down.    It end cause he died to a ghast
Can you put the seed of this world in the description of your vid when it’s finished
Imagine how awesome it would be if he made this a mod
Should've made the map smaller but bigger does look better Gonna be a pain to navigate tho so maybe make like a map thats hidden in each biome
wow .... will it be possible to play it on bedrock? It is for the poor that we do not have Java unu I would really pay you for that majesty that you are creating. awesome, amazing fantastic wowowoowow 💙💙💙💙
That's a lot of blokcs
I add mo Yan ng seed
Nice👍🏻
can't wait another 10 to 20 years where you make your own epic Open world MMORPG.. lol
I'm going to play this on release
Imagine playing on this map and installing a ton of cool mods to play it on the map.
Genshin impact but Minecraft
Is there any download link ?
Me about to like to add to the like goal: he a heckin chonker
I want to play this so bad.
The island lookin kinda sus of you ask me
Good
Will you have videos for each biome? (Pls do)
Hi I
Will you be transforming the Nether and End dimensions? If so, you could do a story as to where Nether and End kingdoms are at war with one another, and the overworld is their battleground.
Is this a mc world or a home brew dnd world?
me duele todo ayuda deaaa le dolia todo, sos alto capo B)
Will it be possible to earn the "adventure time" (visit all biomes) achievement on this map?
Make a HUGE DESSERT VOLCANO with lavender in it and lava spewing out but make it a secret base so you can go in it and the lava is powering the area
Genial que capo bro!!
MORE
I need this to be downloadable NOW! haha
it looks even perfect from start i wonder how it will continue :D
eh uh 80,000 likes huh i think you MAY have passed it by just a little bit
i love it i cant wait
You could add puzzles and traps in the various big structures (jungle temple, ect...) and good loot at the end
Wow this is so cool, I'll definitely have to play on it with my friends when it will be finished :D
**cries in bedrock**
The cleric wagon should have been for the wandering trader! You could have even added different custom trades if you are planning on putting them in the other villages like I'd imagine (I dont play java, but I think that you guys can do that?). that village tho, its giving me major Hateno vibes.
little bit more than 80,000 likes...
Got more then 80k
minecraft designers should take notes
A village in the mushroom biome would be cool
2:47 is this cactus in the tundra ?
The Tree of Life
Airships
A giant underwater cave
A haunted forest
A temple in the clouds
The witches live in the mushroom land
THIS LOOKS GREAT! I can’t wait to play in it. Thank you for your hard work!
Something hidden in the ice
Where can we get this map?
can you make a bridge to the island?
The minion snow cave in the snow
Whats next
You should add a modpack that makes the villagers more intelligent and they have more personal conversations/interactions with the player. Your interactions would determine the trades they make with you. This would make the map feel like it own little game!
where do i download?
When this comes out I'm gonna use tektopia with it.
Honestly I wish Minecraft was like this anyway
I see.. You have a lot of free time don't you.
Can you please leave a world download?
i so want to play this
The village could go well with tektopia maybe
Is it just me or does the map kinda look like the red dead redemption 2 map
Lol can I will add to it if we can get 80,000 likes gets 800,000 likes
How are they going to put the minerals underground?? Or it will all just stone?? :(

Maybe you can also upgrade a woodland mansion
Oh my god i really love this
This has given me so much inspiration for the world I'm making. Just... so much LORE! I wish you immense luck and well wishes in regards to building this and any future pursuits, because this is absolutely amazing.
"Get this to 80 thousand likes" ... *cough cough 700k cough cough*
Grian looking at this: My true successor.
I want this as a world generation mod instead of a map ngl
About places of religious worship, maybe you could make the dark forest a place of some kind of cult?
great job Also I love Zelda both too
You should try to make Resident Evil 7 or Village in Minecraft. That would be super cool!
me: waiting for the blacksmith to get new workshop
Очень прикольный проект, который, наверное, хотел сделать любой любящий строить игрок. Очень мотивирующе
MOJANG! HIRE. THIS. GUY

Why aren’t u working for mojang
That was sus
how to play it :(
Amazing work! I'm looking forward to see the rest :) I think that it would make more sense to swap the market and the quarry/stoneworker since markets are usually in the center of villages and working stone makes a fair amount of noise
Csn you give save to this?
Earned my sub m8 well done
Ok i see the promotion, just clicked...... ok stop now i want to suscribe your work is awesome!!!! thanks a lot for the hard work.
Is this on Java or bedrock :0

I hope mojang implements this or release a map like this
80000likes??!! It deserves more bruh... Just look at the likes now
How do I make the blocks gradually transition from one to the other, like he does pretty much everywhere?
At 5:53 and a bit after, is he using worldedit //replacenear?
How did he make the terrain so variable and custom? Is it all World Painter or is some of it WorldEdit?
This is my favorite video
amazing gud job bro
And people say it's just a game🤷
Make many village because in every biome there has many village
WOW... THIS IS COOL. YOU JUST HAVE HAD BEATEN MOJANG IN THEIR STRUCTURE CREATIONS
I can’t wait for YouTubers to play this
Umm is this Minecraft
Alguém veio aqui pelo jazz?
So I just noticed that we barely hit 80000 like we barely passed it
Add a plane crash
I imagine that the wild west one would somehow reference the one in Tales of The Dream SMP- I would like to see that though
"Realised I miscalculated the size of the map a little" - And the like goal as well (originally 80k, now a stretch goal of 800k). I meant to post this under TrixyBlox's pinned comment, but couldn't because of the reply limit (500 per top-level comment).
I love the bliad
Where i can download the map?
so you turned the cleric into a traveling cart that sells good? So you remade the wandering trader. Hey i mean if your upgrading minecraft they need a serious buff so thats what you did.
anyone like pls so we can play this map
Oh. My. God. Can you make a tiny tent somewhere for the wandering trader? Give the most despised mob in Minecraft a little love.
Will you do gameplay of it once it's out!??!
Now imagine transforming all of this on survival...
You should add some igloos in the snow biome
You are legend
Just an advice, in the ruined portals, you can't light a nether portal with crying obsidians, they just light it with regular obsidians
Sharks
You is incrible
Add some animals that you wouldn’t see I normal Minecraft like lions, bears, and way more animals
Holy crap I’m not the only one, for a while  I’ve been wanting to design something like this but in the game ARK, I’ve wanted to do this on ragnarok but idk if anyone would play on it
👌👷👍
“I’m working on this completely alone with the help of my girlfriend”

pov: you upgraded from hall 1 to hall 2 in clash of clans
I cant wait to play this (hopefully) in xmas when i get a pc with java
You should make a video/series with your fans and have them survive in this map, kind of like a hunger games movie.
Well I never knew that a singular Minecraft world would have lore
Remember to do something in the nether so the immersion isnt broken!
Where's the part 2 ?
oh..... my..... god...... thats impressive
Get this video to 80k likes. When I'm watching it has 10× that
This is amazing
Is it just me or did he make this entire island in reference to Wano Country from One Piece.
Yea mojang really need to learn from you
i have an idea for you not videos but like you make ur own website which does cost money i know and then you teach people how to build in game with eachother for 5 dollars a piece idk i came across this randomly. edit: also the reason i say you shouldn't use fiverr or any apps like that is because you dont want people falling for fake things.
Please i want To download this map
Maybe the biomes could all be at war with each other and maybe in the ice plains a communist movement
13:57 pls make a mod for this
Can’t wait to play this map. This looks so insane! Really impressed😃👍🏻
When u said 80,000 did u mean 800,000 cus ur way farther from that

Pirates fighting in the ocean

My computer would be set on fire if i had a world like that
Can u make a grave jard. My dog just died and it would make me happy if u made a grave for him. His name was luna
Now here's a quick question. Is there gonna be an end portal or is it possible to beat Minecraft with this world?
What about a woodlen mansion
Looks like we met that 80k like goal ;)
I’m so excited for this god damn
A booby-trap launching a flying tnt bomber towards the city
i would do some catacumbs like these big rocks
Such LOTR vibes!!! Absolutely love it
I really think that Mojang should have you create all their worlds.
Will it actually be survival or just adventure, like will there be enough stuff to mine?
Will this be available for Bedrock?
Maybe some specific weapons for specific biomes like if it is a snow mountain add like a weapon that could either be powerful or the same as normal equipment that represents each biomes and those equipments are hidden and hard to find to make it like a trophy that you have conquered that biome
Hey, TrixyBlox! I have an idea for you about something you may want to try doing in this survival world! What if you terraformed the End's "Dragon Platform" into some form of mystical, draconic fortress. One that connected all the giant obisdian pillars together with and slightly ruined wall! If you made it out of a variation of Endstone, obsidian and bedrock (as well as other blocks that the dragon can't delete by flying through it) then it would make the pillars look more like they were part of this once mighty construction either made to keep the Dragon safe, or keep people safe from the Dragon.   Another thing you could do is work on the area around the major spawns in the Nether, making them sort of like a ruined civilization or something. Kinda like there was people who lived here, people from the overworld, but as time went on, their city was destroyed and they were either forced to abandon it, or just all died off, and their buildings were left to the crumbling effects of time in this harsh world.  You don't have to do my idea,s but I just thought it was cool and wanted to bring it up and hear what you think. Good luck on the build!
i think a server should be made with a different faction for each biome, that would be sick
Map battle royale? 😂😂
14:19 your eyes looks like eyes from a demon
This map is amazing I love it I really want to play it.
WOW 😮Nice world
Maybe some jojo references in the secrets lul??
good project my friend
bro you should create mods of these things. we would be able to actually have those godly villages in our worlds btw you are The best minecraft builder i have ever seen.

Chill with the 2k by 2k blocks I just want to see the jungle book tree with moglie in it
Is possible to get just the map without any buidings ?  Just trees and caves ?  I would pay cor that
Umm, not to be rude but can you convert this, so that we can play it on Bedrock/Pocket edition too
Land of dawn this should be this project's name
Can't wait!
Very original and cool! Would you consider adding a swamp? I feel like it could add a lot to the world building!
i will watch your career with great interest

What are the ten biomes that are going to be in there?
im excited for this series
This is fantastic but i'm ignorant so i have a question. How can i replicate structure and reput them? And also, how can i create a map by zero with that program that you used at start of the video?       I discover today your channel and i love it. Already a big fan.
Why cant this be in vanilla Minecraft??? It's literally so beautyfulll
wow
you could do some lore fossils in the mesa or desert biome and maybe feature a frozen one in a glacier
80k? More like 800k lmao
bro i would pay to play in this
11:33 wandering trader           AM I A JOKE TO YOU
I got an idea. Why not do inside the nether something similar along with this world?
Its just amazing, pls go on i like it so much. I want to play it already.
A good storyline and lore that you can play and complete by exploring, doing missions and grinding (like in gta) would be awesome
Van i please Download this World its soooo nice and i would love to Play in it
Deeeeam men, your job is amasing
I want to play that map... RIGHT.NOW.
I’d play this but personally I don’t want my PC to explode
i wanna play this map how i can download this awesome art
Is That Wano Kuni from One Piece ? Its Look Same
Idea: add destroyed castles, trenches if you make a war lore for this map, and camps that were attacked by pillagers.
Why is thir iny dis likes
Will do something special for the nether and ender ?
Damn he kinda went over the like goal. He deserves it tho
Pherb I think I know what were gonna do today
Bruh that's epic
You should make a ruined city
i know im a little late so I will comment this on this video and the next one but you should make a vanilla version and a slightly modded version for some interesting creatures in all the biomes
Your building a map and I can barely make a proper house
lmao they smashed the like goal
Will these be available for pe? Or bedrock edition?
for the mushroom biome, you should make a witch village
Trixyblox: let's see 80000 likes One week later 783000 likes
I want you to include a giant fish by the ocean monument
Is this map going to available to bedrock players
You could have a resource and mob reset kind of like some open-world games so you could keep playing without limitaitions
Mojang going needs to step it their game
A lil but over 80000 likes
Minecraft gotta hire this guy
I would say you put a big fortress in the snowy mountains
Maaan... I don't even know what to say. You deserve a huge respect for that.
Ok wait what!?

This is genuinely so impressive. The amount of time and dedication, just wow. Can’t even imagine. Incredibly impressive to see.
It’s simply amazing. There’s no other words for it.
Wow
This reminds sooo hard from greed Island (hxh). The great world with towns and wide Green fields and the fact that it is a giant island . Great work, cant wait to play this w my friends🔥
you’re literally so creative.
wow u r so good
Wow, are you going to include the updated nether and end in this world?
Broo please make this so bedrock users can play it? 🥺
Will you be changing the nether as well?
On the mountain in the ocean you should build a magical prison for either the ender dragon or the wither and you can only enter it after doing something or obtaining something.
Where can I download it
This is SO COOL
Do some pyramids
You should be in hermitcraft
I think you should make a floating island above it and it could have some cool stuff with it
This reminds me of catan the board game 1:02
r u gonna do a pillager mansion?
Waaaaaaaiiiiiiit wat about the rest
The thumbnail. Kind of looks like the OG fortnite map
Suggestion: How about this, you made a church in the plain biome, for the theme, make a mosque in the desert biome, a Buddhist tempel in the jungle biome, in the snow biome, let's say somewhat about vikings, savana biome, idk someone should put a suggestion. What do you think ? From XD Slippery: Savanna Biome, varios African tribes.
Eye tower (from lord of the rings)

Imagine turn this buildings to a mod, i think it would be the best mod of structures, if all the villages spawn like that and al the another buildings
Imagine if mojang really build like this
Me after making a cool house: Man, I'm the best Minecraft player :)  Me after watching this video: but... I thought I was a good builder and... :(
Isso é só pra computador né?
Good good and good
Crack  trixyblox
Can I download it?
Part two please
Me: tries to make a jungle in Minecraft… Me: can’t even plants a tree…
Speeeechhhh lessssaa so cooooool ,with a details and brilliant idea
I think a hidden base for like the mid game or endgame would be cool
I would love to play in this
And? What the point of this
I think you should make a caravan train and indians in the badlands
You always keep surprising me with those fantastic looking builds. They look fucking awesome!!!! (You should actually work together with mojang to upgrade the buildings a little bit. Would be awesome)
This is the minecraft I've always dreamed of and wished mojang would've made cooler naturally generating structures environments, etc. I've added mods and stuff to try and make it happen but it never really works out just as I want
I actually love this please continue it and finish bc I will be playing it
It is Australia
WOW you are PRO! and the Minecraft!
Hi
Is there a un-customized version of the map and just the in-game buildings to play. and your builds look sick man keep doing you
30.000.000x 30.000.000x map

Petition to make this as a world type in minecraft. Superflat, amplified normal and BEAUTIFUL
Sweats in bedrock
this is what happens when you have too much time on your hands
Are you the 1 who make minecraft
You should add a huge mountain with a dragon sleeping on top
This is the best minecraft word ever
suggestion: a big broken bridge connecting plains and mushroom island, it looks so awesome😍
hes like creating minecraft
Make dungeons under houses
Hi can you add a kingdom in desert and add to a barbarian village in forest thank you 😊
First of all romanian are orthodox not catholic
could you add a swamp biome with an upgraded witch hut
Make this an anarchy sever?
Thumbnail is amogus
i would love to play this map but i'd get like 30fps
do an ultimate nether world
Not even my builds are that good I love the outpost
Man i want to play but i use console ;-;
Pleas this can tell
This definitely deserves a sub. 😁
We need a part 2 of this that includes some sort of huge underground cave system almost like the entire world is hollow
Underwater village pls and sky village
I imagine small witch villages in mushroom biomes and huge reefs deep in the ocean.  And charming little areas in each biome.  This map looks absolutely stunning.  Amazing work.
Insane
The staircase leading to the ruined portal is a bit odd. It's good, but something feels off... What I mean is it's unsettlingly straight. I don't know how to say it but I believe you got the point
This is so accurate
Turn the entire stronghold into a prison/Tartarus to almost make it seem like they’re holding the ended dragon in the end to make sure it doesn’t escape
9:52 The villagers look like mosquitos when he was building
‼️I MISS THE RAGE‼️
Now do it in the bots and chisels mod, lol.
Aw mannnn now I will actually feel guilty for burning down and pillaging a village
Might be fun to make a Druid's home or temple or something underneath a larger than normal tree for one of the forest biomes - maybe it interacts with the zombie village are somehow narratively?
Damn where can I download this
can we just appreciate the like to dislike ratio on this amazing video.
are u gonna also customize something underwater?? maybe try to make something like atlantis from aquaman
Add a sky village
u should also customize the nether and end
ReaLY REALY WANT TO PLAY IT ITS INSANE
Map download link???
Create a wildlife forest please🥺🥺 for the animals especially the descendants of technoblade
Ok so ima definitely play this when it comes out and will it be free or will we have to pay for it? Also what name will it be under and will it be multiplayer?
junjle reminds me of the map of Brazil   "J"I came by jazzghost.
This is a loooot of work, you should add some people in the project
I want this World Who else❤️
botw basically lol
Mojang Studios should hire you 👍
This is amazing
Now that was real minecraft world, so much of history and graphic
This might be to much work but it would be better if you add a spooky mansion

When is trixyblox going to post the next video
CASTLE.
Will you be able to play this on PlayStation
AND HE PUT IT IN A 15 MIN VIDEO all that in just and 15 min vid
You guys really don't know how amazing this is.  You need to be so creative and have a l o t of patience for what he did, and all for us.  Many people just don't know how much effort this takes, and merely compliment on how pretty it looks, not the time and absolute creativity that went behind it, and he even included inner decor and adventures!   It's amazing, so amazing.
Well can you give us to download this world?🙏
brush your teeth or dont use cam.
Mojang has gotta see this
What level of patreon is this again? Seriously take my money this is amazing! I've been playing minecraft for up to five years now and have recently really lost motivation for simple vanilla, but this map is incredible and has rekindled my creativity and desire to explore! Truly you are one of, if not the, most talented and dedicated minecraft builder the world has ever seen! Hats off to you good sir!
So is this gonna be for Java, Bedrock or both?
Wow
I swear he was at 1mil a week ago now he’s at 1.5mil
Bro im pumped for this, it would be dope as fuck with some mod packs. I'm definitely subbing to the patreon for this.
13:27 gettin those far cry 5 vibes
I assume that this is java, and I am upset cuz i have bedrock  :(
Alternate title: "Turning a Minecraft world into a Battle Royale Map"
Wait wait wait wait what about the birch forest
Wow, this world will look insane if I play this with SEUS PTGI shaders and umsoea resourcepacks. I can't wait to play this world. Nice job.
mabye there could be people banished from the wild west towns and villages in the snow biome and there is alot of traps dotted around aswell as their base camps
i cant wait to play this omg

Sheeeesh you dont have to do this just for likes and subs༼ つ ◕◡◕ ༽つ
Doesn't have a seed ?
You can add some grave yards in the village and under it will be some zombie villagers in the village, you can add ruin and inside it has some vines and some flowers for villagers to take care (hint: histories always has some secrets)
Why is This so entertaining

imagine this as a mmo rpg, the possibilities are endless
Are we going to be able to download this map??
How do you get the world?
i need this map asap to play with my friends
Bittybi Bittybi Boo this Awesome Map is just for java and you're playing bedrock too
HOLLY CRAP! Just I'm speechless! Words can not express how excited I am for this project! I'm DEFINITELY Spreading the word about this because God damn is this going to be epic when it's made public!   Also maybe for each biom make there be a couple or a few massive ore veins that fit each biom. Like for example diamonds in the desert, emeralds in the Plains (because villagers), maybe iron or lapis in the snowy/mountain biom, etc. I think that would be awesome and help out the survival world a ton!  And what I mean by that is usually you get anywhere from between 3 & 6 diamond ore blocks  usually per each spawn spot and rarely will you get around 10 or more, I actually had a seed back in the day that gave me 13 blocks! Not even kidding I thought it was a bug or glitch but nope just really ungodly lucky RNG. But diamonds are super rare and hard to get ai having that be either exactly or close to double the normal spawn would help big time especially with animal armor mods it'd be nice to deck out my pups and kits or even donkeys in diamond armor because I could afford it lol. But that's just an example feel free to tweak it how you see fit
Do a Endor seen from Star Wars in the dark forest or jungle
This is crazy
0:01 When the land is sus 😳
Imagine the lore that you could make of this,  With the new Minecraft update coming you can literally say that there was another biome that like, sunk beneath the earth or something and that can be the last biome,
Will this be available on bedrock?
Tell me when ur done so I can have it
This series finna make his subs skyrocket.
coolest things ever!!!
Me who can't even build a dirt house: 😀☝️😶
MAKE IN AN RPG!!!
OMGGG THIS IS AMAZING I CANT WAIT UNTIL ITS FINISHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Amazing 👏
Super excited! I plan on getting Java edition anyways, but will there be a possible Bedrock edition port? Love what you do man!
the church is comically large and too scaled up compared to the rest of the village. Also, you could have made a cooler windmill blade design. The current one lacks creativity and looks very basic.
will there be regular ores
Add a mushroom village
If you play on it for long enough, all the custom trees will be gone because saplings grow normal trees I think. If you have time you should make a mod we’re the saplings grow the custom trees.
Onigashima kkkkk!!!
Oh my... in a week you got over 500k subscribers !
wow.. WOW... omfg
I’m totally buying this
Just wow cant say anything 😎
It’s a lot to ask but when this is finished I would like to use this for a survival series so if you could, could you make every single achievement possible to help the series out
”get this video to 80 thousand likes for the world download”  1 week later 730K likes

You should base the Wild West off of rdr2 style a bit I think it would be a really good idea
Kool
Will this be ported onto 1.17?
Sooooo cool man😃

Hello bro , i wait your link for download map 😉 good jobs !!!
viking village
DUDE 6 DAYS AGO IT WAS JUST AT 80K NOW 700K+ DUDE CONGRATS YOUR FAMOUS
This is amazing, im so excited for this project! Some ideas I would lovee to see added is:  1. Mysterious dungeons and structures underground. Maybe even a cave settlement or something?  2 . Reoccuring sculptures/structures scattered around the map, possibly from a secret cult spanning across the biomes or something  3. A seaside town and/or villagers living on boats.  4. Some random cabins or houses scattered around the map, either abandoned or inhabited by only 1 or 2 villagers.  Good luck with the project! Cant wait to play on the map once it's completed<3
Bro, this is art, seriously
it kinda looks like among us
imagine some awesome mod with this map (something like rlcraft)
It felt like a Game of thrones map
Pls post it free on your patron

Maybe you could include an even better sunken pirate ship.
you need to put a jumpscare warning if you’re gonna show your girlfriend

Such a beautiful build. I honestly wish I could build like this, if I could then I would totally dedicate so much more time to my dirt houses :/
Have like old and rickety wooden bridges to the moosh room biome
What did he use to create the island?
just want to say ' THIS IS INSANEEEE'
How do the house look inside
i think u should put a temple where theres like a boss and insane rewards
Fantastic video, I’ll enjoying playing on this map with friends when it becomes available
You should make a custom nether and end as well!!
Wow this is very big
when will the second ep of the series will be released?
Make it compatible to play in low-end pc too please 🙂😭
Nice
Get this video to 80,000 likes  Almost had 10x that number in likes
Just impressed every time
soo good
I was wondering, if you could possibly put this amazing world up for downloads? For survival
Mojang should team up with you!
If you're gonna add lore, you can leave evidence of a huge war. You could find cool OP weapons buried under the ground in caves. Also please add pirate ships!
Are the mountains filled with iron coal ect..
legend has it Trixy built all of those PS4/Xbox Mash up worlds
Amazing this is so good love all the upgrades to the mc world
Holy friggin crap am I excited to get in on this!
u did not did the wild west dude
Can we also play this on bedrock and java both
The world looks so sus
This is for 1m special and right now he has 1.5m
I need it...I need it
Just amazing, can’t wait to see the Wild West stuff!
Well, what about you send a seed in minecraft
Look so good and will that world be on the ps4?
If I did this which would be way too hard for me I'll include tribe in the tundra
Add a Market in the middle of the village
80k likes more like 730k likes pfftttt
is this whole map a bob ross reference
12:44  Trix: this is a small church also him: builds a church that if was in real life would be  5x bigger than my house
Make a pillager village in the taiga biome   Also make large farms and blacksmiths In the village  It resembles the pillagers using villagers as their workers and slaves. And also make a prison with villagers The prison is for the villagers that tried to kill pillagers or escape the village
I have an idea that you could make that as a battle royale battle field
screw 80k likes, its 725k likes
Evryone wants to download and play this map
It’s the red dead map
Could you add a stable?
This man is on a different level. But it looks amazing. Am I personally trash
What is the program for creating the world you used?
I’m interested you’ve got my attention I low-key want more
Me downloading this map My PC:Thats a suicide mission
This looks great
Same
this map is going to be so awesome omg
How vanilla structures looked to me as a kid
The hospitable appliance greely invite because snowflake thirdly sparkle until a stereotyped tune. long-term, kind pakistan
I bet this took forever to build
can you include questlines with book/quills and delves with bosses like skyrim?
Im hoping there will be a bedrock download as well.
Uh did you uh well uh make it to where people who play PE minecraft players can download and play this world just curious
I need this world
Bro you look dead ass like a young John Snow
This is what Youtube needs more and this is what Mojang  should be inspired by - but thats just obvious,  so lets talk about less obvious but also  important stuff:   The Tektopia Mod was literally made for people  like this Youtuber, as well as Jeracraft,  so its amazing amount of wasted Potential  that both happen to never have used  this Mod.  Its made for them; they've been born to use it, I'd say!    Also: For the jungle-portion, i absolute recommend the EPIC MOD  that the Youtuber 'Amazed One' just presented. Its so amazing  it should be made into Vanilla-Minecraft anyway, so check it out!!   I hope Trixy Blox and Jeracraft and Mojang all  take my comment to Heart; at least as a noted-down 'Plan'.
Epic.
Not sure if I’ll get any notice for my idea, but what if you made a sort of underground tribal piglin village with a mystic theme of transforming the over world into the neither, and they worship the forgotten old god ‘Wither’
i want this download soooooo bad
I gotta asked, who are the people that left 3k dislike.       People who left a dislike 🤡.
Imagine a flying fuing god just renovating your village for no apparent reason
I hope the download is soon available for the public!!! Can’t wait to see how many surprises I’ll see in it!
I really hope you make this world bedrock too!! I really want to play this
Zelda BotW was the best game I’ve ever played
The only time I want to be a villager...
What is the seed?
I love this, I’ll be running a server with this map when it’s ready 100% subbed to keep up !
Minecraft one love
Looking forward to more!
Maybe some “ancient ruins” of previous civilizations/kingdoms scattered around? I also liked the idea posted by someone else about making a cave system that connects all biomes with some secrets to it.  Edit: cave idea by K0les
I'm extremely excited!!! I've already subscribed!!!!!!
An underground catacombs level in one of the biomes would be cool, or like a futuristic lab in a snowy mountain
This guy is amazing. This is only the first video of his that I’ve seen (because it was in my recommended), but he should really have more subscribers. He literally is going to recreate the entire minecraft overworld, which will be over 16,000,000 blocks, and he is asking for only 80k likes to do it. Just wow.
When will you finish it I really want to play this bloody world
Can you do the nether to become a new nether world
is this gonna be able to play on ps4?!
You should make an island not far off the coast of like a mining corporation with fake dump trucks and stuff which also acts as a big mining island so we can get the supplies we need without destroying the world.
The church looks like Harry Potter’s school
Shitttt...
This looks like so much fun to make not gonna lie
I’ll reinstall the game for this when it’s done
We need it!!
I wish I had that map in my minecraft 🥺it's beautiful
Your soo good I like it by the way new subcriber here❤️
Is it gonna be available for pocket edition ? 🥺🙏🏻
When's the next biome coming out?
will this world be applicable for bedrock?
Realy cool
Keep going with this mate! It’s inspiring
ooooh maybe an underground ancient civilization would be cool
..i.. i wanna play this so bad
Microsoft should hire u in thier company
Will it be possible to play this on ps4?
Amogus
Only 80k???
Oii or hii, i'am brazillian
Quem veio pelo Geguegoast da like
man it has been 10 days now, WHERE IS PART 2?????
Can you add a abandant house please
"...you'll still need a diamond pickaxe..." *laughs in speedrun*
can you do a modded custom survival map for 2million follower
I think a datapack that modifies progression within this map would be awesome! Imagine, instead of progressive to the nether naturally, you had to find the pieces of obsidian for the portal yourself in each of the different biomes, of which can be found through the little stories in each area, while still having a Minecraft based gameplay.
i want this map bruuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh
U should make some ruins in the snowww and disperse comunities in the dessert
The start of the video:trixiy thank us for 1 milion subs Ten days later: 500 k New vieweres
Why is Full metal Alchemist in my mind now.....
quwria jogar nesse bioma selokooo
I really love this video the Way you transform is so amazing but i Think the windmill is a bit unrealistic i Think the blades are Way to small for it to rotate if it was real
After you finish this, I really want to see you transform the nether and the end. I think you could make some cool end cities, a cool arena for the ender dragon, and a super cool looking nether fortress.
CRISPY BUILDS
When’s the next vid out
this creation is more like a rpg game
Alternative title: Bullying Bedrock players for 15 minutes
Imagine making this in survival
Mad respect, all you asked for was 80,000 likes. You deserve way more
I think he forgot to add mobs in some of the places
THAT'S SICK!!!
You.   Deserve WAY more subscribers
MORE AND MAKE MORE...plz, I need inspiration
You need a small cave leading to a huge cave with a lot more custom dungeons maybe with a lot of traps, make them feel like their not alone on the island
Some serious GoT and LotR vibes. Looking amazing! What platform will it release on? I'm guessing PC but hoping for xbox and ps
Pleaseeeeeeee give the download link
did you say 80k? cuz thats 722k likes XD enough likes to last for 9 videos (each 80k req)
Did you add the dark oak mansion?
I came for jazzghost
Download pls
This is already a beautiful map
WHERE IS MY SWAMP????
Mojang needs to make him the designer for them at this point!!
When the thumbnail is sus! 😳
Add a sword In the stone reference in the snowy area
Bedrock?
ITS  SOOO COOL  LIKE I WISH I COULD BUILD
I would love to stumble upon a secret hidden area with a random, fun working redstone device.
Bro dude, not trying to insult you, but you look like an in-between of a teenager and an adult
this what you called proo
Men all my respect for you
Imagine if that would be a real survival world
Question, why do you have eyelashes on only one eye?
100 day hardcore
This is absolutely amazing. I can’t wait to see the next part and fully intend to play it for myself, I love the vibe. Are you going to do the Nether and End? I understand if you’re not, it would be a lot of work but it would be cool. Also, which biome is the stronghold going to be in? I personally think it could be cool in the snowy biome or the taiga biome. Also, you could put some ice spikes and sheets in the ocean around the snowy area? I don’t know I think it could look cool. Looking forward to the next part 💚 Edit: Also, maybe so that the hand-built trees don’t get destroyed, place around some normal ones?
When you releasing it bro?
When the map finished ?
this should be a battle royale map dude!!!!!!!!!
“Make sure to to get this video to 80,000 likes”      Gets 720,000...
"I want to keep it in vanilla style..."  Proceeds to make the Witcher 1 in Minecraft.
the water in-between the main land and mushroom island could feature a large skeleton underwater. I think that would be so cool, and could possibly explain the shipwreck (whatever it is one of them attacked the boat or something)
721k like. Where is the map dude??
Maybe it isn't that original but it would be cool seen meteorite blasts and alien starships as aaster eggs and a secret lore around it
How to download this map 😂😂😂
What's the seed for the map (unbuilt)
The thumbnail is just catan
how did you make your own map like that i wanna make a own server like that

U could add little cemetery next to church for more immersion
What the heck Trixyblox, do you even sleep? I’ve been designing technical plans for a big site IRL for the last 2 and a half years and I’ve seen the most incredible creations from you in the last year... I feel lazy compared to your work! I hope Steph plans enough rest for you and I hope you listen to her advise ;) Anyways, again, fantastic job already! I’m excited to see how this will turn out and will definitely try to get and play this one :D Greetings from Belgium 🇧🇪💪
Me gustaría un mapa así para crear mi mundi
Anyone else think he was making the fortnite map in minecraft from the thumbnail
How about adding special powerful weapon like helberd ,battle axe, scythe and many more
OMG  IS THAT MMO RPG MAKE IT A SERVER
Soon 10 million :)
TrixyBlox: 80.000 We: 80.000??? naaaa, 720.000 better

Why doesn’t Minecraft hire this guy to rebuild the vanilla structures
Dexa pra download
my guy i just have a question are you gonna edit the neather too?
Put Gold sword with op enchantment in a big stone monuments and call it  *Excalibur*
You kill my channel
It would be cool if there are other villages
Blacksmith left the Minecraft universe
The villagers deserve this because some villagers are slaved by players
Him: 80k likes  Us: hehe how about 720k likes ggwwwwwaaaahahahahahahahaaa
And the world is already beautiful without the structures I'm just sad cus I play bedrock I can't download thos
Me: speechless
can you create a one piece theme map? that would be' awesome
I know is not very realistic but maybe in the jungle section you could add a very very giant tree with internal parts and giant branches. Maybe some secrets inside or a little village living there. Kinda like the movie Avatar haha
dude this is amazing
I NEED MORE
Can you make this map for download?
This hard work deserves a subscribe :3
You should try to build vienamese terrace field

Jesus

This needs to be the new tutorial world
Wait 16 million whaaaa
https://youtu.be/UZiUfT1rVyM
I want some vampire castell in the snowy mountains
One cool thing would be if you made the story of a past adventurer who went throughout the entire map, using books/book and quills, the author name could be broken text and it is only answered in the end with a final book with an actual author name
PLEASE JUST WORK WITH MOJANG ALREADY PLEASEEEEEE, YOU COULD TRANSFORM MINECRAFT FOR THE BETTER, PLEEEAAASSEEE
BRO this is called Creativity
A tempel dedicated ro bob Ross!

You really said: "Ok, so today, I'm embarrassing Mojang"
Mushoom Island should have a mushroom form, from the sky
I must need this map
Just wondering when the next vid is coming out
Wow I really loved the idea
Wonderful
Wow you get thumps up and a follow for that video
Woow (there's mandjtv)
I've never played hardcore but I think I will make this my hardcore world once you finish it.
Dislikes are of   minecraft designers 🤣🤣🤣    jealousy you know
You should add birch trees and upgrade the little island cause it look like a circle
World download?
Me: well i achieved all achievements in hardcore..what now..  Him:i have a BIIIIG MAP  Me: *intense exitment*
I want to have the building skill like you. Breathtaking job!

This looks SO GOOD I'm really excited for this!
Wandering trader to cleric be like: Are you challenging me?
I need this seed
a modpack for this would be absolutely insane
I need to kno where do you get world   Creator
Looks ok
I like how this guy alone did more and better updates than Mojang's updates in a shorter period of time.
You should build a big winding dark castle in the swamp biome. Like a witches castle.
B R U H H
U shud make a terraforming tutorial
Upgrade mesa next bro. Its gonna look great
Ad a big shark and let us go in it mouth
What about the neather in this world?
Seria um sonho jogar num mundo assim.. queria ver mais upgrades
You are doing great
Whatsappje is the seed
You should build a secret base that people can either live in or loot
You deserve 20 million subs, these builds are the best ones I’ve ever seen, and I’ve played minecraft for 8 years. Keep going and I swear if I can’t download this map I will die. Your the best builder in Minecraft history.
Corn
It looks like amphibia
Crystal covered cave in the mushroom island?

Jeez this must have been a long project good job man
This is just simply mind blowing.
This is soooo cool
wtf, I can actually use your map to write a fantasy story XD
How to download this map
You should definitely add some sort of like stop for wandering traders!! That would be so cool!
Why would anyone dislike?
A whole map storyline that progress to the day

Wartwood?
This is reminding me of Aphmau’s series called Minecraft diaries
Alguém veio pelo jazzghost?
Add Harry styles 😂 idk you said suggest something and that was obviously the first thing I thought of lol
https://youtu.be/xo9SLTZI7N4
I love it😘😘
Do this world for bedrock edition too
Of course no link for download -___- this cute map
Upload tge world in medifile I want to download
Mojang’s devs are gonna be embarrassed when someone compares em to this monstrosity. Epic build and add red stone.
You should try modifying the nether as well
Did anyone else get a trailer for that lame scary beach movie 😂
is there anything cooler than this? Bullshit... this is the best!!!
You should do this in the cubic chunks mod so you can build thousands of blocks up
i wonder if someone asked that but anyways its gonna be possible to download map to play it on?
once cave update comes out, you should totally do some epic looking mineshafts and underground dungeons using the new blocks
this was published on my bday!
Include sharks
It would be cool if there was an anciebt underground temple or village in the jungle biome
You should make a fallen kingdom aswell
Add a volcano that would be really cool
I like 👍
"80k likes" gets 700
Put a secret in the lake that's in the middle, some kind of abandoned, flooded out place filled with remnants and scatters of what it once was and what happened.
Also a cool easter egg you could build would be a giant ufo frozen in the ice in the snowy mountains!
So when will the map be up for download?
Nice
The square frost literally thaw because whip immunophenotypically drip above a drab position. unsuitable, jaded body
I'm definitely gonna stream this map on my twitch blurrybasil
8:01
Its almost impossible to believe that you made this entire map! The details are amazing!
Where can i find the seed or map?
Very good
"dummies...your dummy"
It feels really nice I want to go there
I we'll buy da world
The plains is Attack On Titan lol
And you destroy 3736362891 blocks
Shulkercraft is writing...
This is wano
Wow you have true talent! I can’t wait till we are able to play this world
Bro, cool builds i can tell you love what you do, but who stole your eyelashes?
What about the blacksmith?
I feel like a cool idea in the middle would either be a huge castle/village or just a boss arena. Or maybe a mix, with a giant castle/village “guarding” a boss thing in the center
g o d . d a m n .
Upgrade the nether
MAKE THE NORTH POLE IN THE SNOWY BIOME AS A "hidden" FEATURE
You should add the woodland mansion in the dark forests
Does loot and mobs spawn in the chests and villages?
I WANNA PLAY THIS SO BAD THIS SOUNDS SO SO SO COOL DUDE
Wano? One piece?
I'm subscribing now xd
what shaders?
Pirate ship
a giant skeleton of something dead on the map would be sick
hey dude, can you put a link to where you downloaded your mods? i really want to try out the mod where there are super small blocks and you can make custom doors and stuff. i'd really like to try it out, so if you see this comment, please reply with a link to the website you got the mod from. i don't know which website to go to because i'm worried about getting a virus. i'd really appreciate it!
This man made Minecraft better🤣🤣
I just subscribed to support you for this cool project
I haven’t played Minecraft in years. It all became too repetitive. This looks like it would add a much bigger sense of discovery back into the game and might cause me to redownload it!
This is going to finish and be released, and within two months it will become a fully fledged RPG Adventure map.  Placing bets right now!
Wow, amazing much respect!
It's soo cool. I'm really looking forward to the next video.
Im so excited to play this with my brother!!!
it would be fun to play conquest from bf5  on this map
You know what this needs? A villager named Big Chungus.
This is amazing, but i still think vanilla is boring to play. Would be even cooler to add mods or make special modpack for this map, make it kinda like what skyrim is. Ofcoure if you would do that that would require a lot more work. Also with mods you could make your builds even more detailed, and with even better looking blocks than vannila
I’m glad to see my boi has finally been gaining viewers and getting noticed because of this video.
I wouldnt be suprised if he made the map for hupixel.
Give nasa their computer back
This looks so incredible and I'm really looking forward to it! Will it be free to download or only for patreons? Didn't quite catch that
Plz post more of this world and the map, would love to make a series out this world.
how can ı download it
Can you make it into a bedrock mcaddon
you can do somothing in the air as well like ballons on a mounten or something like that
just give an ip
Круто продолжай дальше. Поддержу с русского ютуба
Trixy Blox add a lodge in the snowy mountain biome
This map needs a JoJo reference
bro i have an awesome idea, u should do a crater with a meteor in it either on the map or in the water next to it, woukd be sick for the storyline
Trixyblox: i want 80K likes pls *Proceeds to get 711k likes*
Hopefully I’ll get my pc in time to play this!
honestly i think u are in the top 3 greatest builders minecraft had ever seen
THIS IS AN ISEKAI
Stone hedges with a few twists and design would be a good design for secrets and lores per backgrounds! Like a certain theme per biome and lores would be good for it!
Will this be available for Bedrock edition?
Is this available on console
Yo i love this!!!!!!! Can wait for more episodes
Swamp
I would like the story to be optional. Because I like to explore and hate being on a story quest all the time
Petition for dream to play this on a Manhunt series
Can you please tell us the seed number 😩😩
when (if ever) they add a beekeeper profession, they should sell candles! (obviously maybe honey blocks and flowers as well, but I still think candles would be the coolest) they could be like part florist part bee keeper and the bees would not be aggressive towards the villager that keeps them :D
You should make a colleseum I don’t know how to spell it a gladiator arena
Base the savanna off of the movie Black Panther  You build a wakanda
I've been thinking, how about a Lord of the Rings / The Hobbit minecraft world? That would be dope! 🤙🏻
imagine a server on that island tho
The optimal stove tinctorially stamp because writer essentially coach round a ceaseless voice. swanky, jumbled myanmar
If he built the entire world by hand it would take a lifetime
can you join the world ?, sick world
Damn
You should consider making a graveyard by the church. You could even add some mysteries and coffins in the ground
Mojang should hire this man to do master designing minecraft
I have some questions, really wish to see an answers from Trixy:  1. Are you going to rebuild nether and the end? 2. Are you keeping technical part of structures and biomes, such as mob spawning (especially in structures such as pillager avanposts, nether fortresses and so on) so all vanilla mechanics are kept and working properly? 3. Are you going to introduce custom loot tables or at least use vanilla ones to fill the map with loot? 4. Are you keeping every single feature of vanila minecraft map or some things may not be included? For me the most important thing is to keep the functionality of all farms that are possible in minecraft and are based on the world generation. 5. If your map won't have all the functions of the default minecraft world, are you going to add a list of things that you CANNOT do with this map in compression to the vanilla world?  It's an enormous and ambitious project and I really like the idea of having a big custom Minecraft map for surviving. But Minecraft has a lot of different features and the technical side of the map is very important for keeping all the mechanics that we used to have in vanilla Minecraft working as they were intended by Mojang.  Ps. here are some quick answers from discord server: 2 yes, 3, possibly, 4 most likely, and 5 no Answers above are given from the discord moderator.  And for another dimentions there is a pinned answer:   - Hopefully, depending on demand, the Nether will be transformed in the area where the Ruined Portal (from the first video) leads to    - Hopefully, depending on demand, the End will be transformed where the hidden Stronghold's End Portal leads to
How I can download the map?
i shall be waiting for part 2 even if it takes 2 years
Hey, once this is finished can you make it a map in the marketplace on bedrock?
Exciting stuff
You the best. Never stop)
do an abandoned castle with loads of like skeletons inside
The best part is the bob Ross reference
Minecraft take some notes
the expected Minecraft update, lol, (MINECRAFT World Update)
Add ostriches or hawks yes I am salty that they didn't pick Savannah or badlands in minecon earth
This is going to be INCREDIBLE!!!
Add ostriches or hawks
709k>>80k likes, gg!
Ever since this video came out I just keep checking to see when the next part will be uploaded.
can u make a specific pet 4 each biome?
13:27 but with that we built the earth
Add a Wandering Trader's building or something!
This is awesome. I can't wait for this to be finished.
What about wandering traders-
wow
Can u make this be playable for others because I think this is so cool
Speechless
Damn this guy. I want this map for my xbox rn! It's so great!
Tagging onto my other comment, some Zelda style dungeons would be awesome to see.
This is absolutely awesome Trixy! Im just now finishing Breath of the Wild and would love to play this due to the similar landscapes. Can’t wait!
F for the 80k like 😂
Now someone needs to do NPCs and we got ourselves A GAME
The design looks like Wano lol
I Will troll my friends with this world when u are done 🙂
This is epiK
A story smp wold be epick on this world!
I love how every building is so unique and amazing. I love it in every way.
PLEEAAASSSEEE Have some secrets in the ocean around the island
Ok i like your talent but you do you look like a david dobrik wannabe
Is there gona be another video about the island
This is fascinating!
This is so COOL
This looks beautiful
Where can I play this?
Can u share the server link I want to play this minecraft server 😁
you should make one the biome's themed as japan
😲 is it minecraft or something else?
This is going to be awesome, definitely going to play the second it comes out
16 million what that's not a tiny miscalculation
This became his second most viewed in a week.
This is the legend of zelda, minecraft edition.
It’s funny because the farm in the plains looks kinda like a steak. 🥩
Mojang take notesss
Where can i find the link when it comes out
You should add a secret bunker
If mojang added this to the game I’ll never stop playing mc
Breathtaking. Do the buildings have insides?
ITS SO COOL
The pillager tower design should be added to vanilla
F me
This is what we need for minecraft
is it kind of like a story mode?
Unbelievable
That theme in the planes are so cool. It would be amazing if you can change how villagers interact to the players in different biomes like in the desert the western would sometimes be angry to you and sells bunch of meats and weapons with enchantments and to the tundra biome villagers should be cold to you or doesnt really take you seriously unless you give them stuff or you do something for them. If you could tapped into the codes of this game and change their behavior or find a mod and throw in a bunch of them together it would be so amazing to play like an rpg or roguelike style inside this beautiful game
will this be in pe? (00)                                   -
I couldn’t have been the only one that thought of the old fortnite map when I saw the thumbnail.

THIS IS GONNA BE A WORKABLE SURVIVAL WORLD !!!
May i ask? Is the map mobile friendly?
wowwwww, in my mind how long did he do this
WHO TOOK THE TIME TO DISLIKE??!!!!
You should do a wandering trader instead of a cleric and lamas instead of horses
Now I wish you could build my fantasy world I invented in Minecraft XD
where can i download it?
I very want to play on this map. Beautiful atmosphere of this buildings! Nice work, dude!
https://youtube.com/channel/UCezQA1BuRSCvq-ccNZ7Jb8Q
Giant apes
Bigfoot and a yeti having some tea
😳
You should add a big woodland mansion, like bigger than regular and with more detail.
i dont even play minecraft but this is awesome liked it
I love this maps 👌🏻
I subscribe
Him-building a world  Me-cant build a house
Minecraft should hire him. 😳 The original building was ok but his recreation if it was 10x better!
I want to play? I want. but it will cost my pc, F
I want this map!!!! Lol🤩
when is it coming out ip .................
In the snowy mountains you should add Aang from avatar the last airbender in some ice somewhere like a armour stand and dyed leather armour and the custom head skull  A small cool detail bit
Can you make something really small to the middle of nowhere. Something to notice when randomly passing by.
can you add a jungle temple with some secrets
Graveyard?
so will you uplode the map?plssssssssss
Red dead redemtion in minecraft
The island from the thumbnail looks like Catan
The outpost gives me asssin creed vibes
Pov: your god
Minecraft hire this man
Dino’s in grass land
Now we have a fortnite map
The map looks like Wano Kuni in One piece
Mojang needs to hire this person.  If anyone is familiar with Wrel / Planetside 2, this feels like the start of that.  So much passion. Especially with these ideas tied to the vanilla structures and game, I'm legitimately not joking. They would be foolish to not offer a job working on building design from you.   Additionally, I don't know your financial situation, but I sincerely hope you make enough money from yt / patreon/ etc... that this is your job. Because if anyone did, you deserve it.
He might be working on the other biomes now!
Just incridible. Your work is fantastic!
A whole underground cave system connecting all the biomes together with some secrets
You should make the groups of boulders point to the ruined portal
This is perfectly insane. Back then, I happened to wish transforming the villages and biomes, yet I couldn't. Now, this perfectly shows me how it feels like if I achieved it. It's a pleasure to see someone working on this. I hope you to continue this insane project!
Vanilla superior
Don't you think you should've waited for the 1.17 update?
i cant believe this!
can we download the map now? or a bit later?
This is the best thing i ever seen
I’m not gonna lie,minecraft would have been better with these sorts of maps.
seed
I would love it if we can make a war game from this map
Sheesh
Ur a god at building
Nice
80k? Gotcha we got 705k
You need to make some hills
Don’t forget the stronghold😉 absolut amazing building project!
Make a slave dungeon like pewds.
Brother... Wow... I'd love to play a DnD game based on this map
Looks like the hunger games.
Make a 12,000 x 12,000 blocks for castle
I cant biuld it like that hmmmmm but i try him
Mojang, hire this dude
TLDL: Town need walls, please.       MY  ARGUMENT FOR WALLED TOWNS: Hi, as a dedicated survival or hardcore player, I would really appreciate it if world builders could fix Minecraft's biggest oversite:   any village that would want to survive the Minecraft world (a place infested with zombies) would have to have defences to survive.    towns starting with defences are more immersive, practical and more aesthetic than the players 1-day rush fencing and look more alive (while being more likely to stay alive) than towns where players just build people into their houses. not to mention protecting thems selves from creepers maintains their splendour.  the final bonus is that defended towns act as a safe haven to a player; creating an interest cure in play, in the same way, that RPG's from Deablo to Skyrim have: by creating a populated safe haven for trade from which to adventure.     DOWNSIDE TO WALLED VILLAGES IN GAMES?  well, I can only think of one, most people imagine a wall as a repeated texture or wall segment, meaning that a wall can look very boring very easily.  It takes a skilled artist to make defences aesthetically pleasing while minimizing their workload (ps love the wall around the pillager outpost).   Historically: defences were an engineering wonder, here's a link to a site going into detail about medieval curtain wall construction and the art of defence http://medievalcastles.stormthecastle.com/essays/all-about-castle-walls.htm#:~:text=Castle%20walls%20are%20also%20called,walls%20changed%20over%20the%20centuries.  long story short: please add walls or other defences to settlements!  Ty and potatoes.
The best Video of all time🙌
When is this out?😭😭
You deserve a world creator award for this masterpiece.  Mojang should hire you, one day.
Reminds me of the Greed island from hxh
Don't get me wrong this still looks good but you PC players have it so good I have to do this sort of stuff without world edit
Mojang should hire this guy
Stop swiping that mouse and swipe them teeth with a brush instead my guy
PART 2!!!!
Plz do a giant skeleton of a giant creature in the mountain/cave, but you can do whatever you want
have you thought about rotating the custom trees and such? they look really really good, but when they all face the same way, it makes the copy and pasting a bit obvious is all.
Btw, some ruins like from villages would be good too
Everything looks satisfine by watching. Even mojang can't implament as a vinila these strucktures of building for better look. Well done (thumbs up)
I dont have a pc to play minecraft but dang im so gonna try this out once i get an access to play minecraft
Jesus it’s like breath of the wild in Minecraft
@TrixyBlox pls do some pvp servers from your coolest maps!!!
No download link?
On bedrock or Java? Also, will the seed be available?
really cool
For the savhanna I recommend dirt hut town.
I see u on teddit
there are gonna be so many posts of idiots building green tops on this map xD
Pls make more updates on every biome before download
can I play that in Bedrock then?
Bob ross yay
Hide a Rick roll in a cave
how long does it take to design and make this in solidworks   resent I started learning how to work with solidworks and was curious
This reminds me the fan-made map of Re:Zero world.
I am going to replay Minecraft with this map or i wont
What about underground? And different worlds (end and nether)
since this map will be for survival playing, it would be good to add in things for gameplay. around the world you’ve added boulders of stone. maybe you could add in some ores in them, or if you dig down inside one you’d find some ores. in the quarry, theres some coal. but it would be nice if you dug down and find some more ores. just little things like that, which give decoration gameplay purposes
Can you make the story like you using a portal and you go into the other dimension
The 3.6k that disliked are just mad they aren’t as good as you
80k like yep
Add a shadow of Israphel reference!!..
Idk why but this map reminds me of fortnite chapter 1 map
You should add a ruined castle and some dungeon, under some structures. In these dungeon i would do very longs hallways with statues at the sides and loot at the end of it.
Amazing how Trixy is bringing this 10-year-old sandbox game which has evolved a lot on its own to life with these amazing builds
island is sus
You can build pirats boats on sea
I don't play survival almost at all, I typical stay in creative, but this, this is something that would motivate me to start back into playing!
Him:builds a merchant Me:*Duke the merchant memories*
What is about ore generation?
powerful !
We absolutely destroyed the like goal

This is like making Tammie in minecraft

Now it's 703k LIKES?!
What about the swamp biome
Faze Jarvis from wish
A Viking village in the snow area would be cool I think
I wish I can download it on Android to play with hardcore mode
_The Map Looks Like A Parrot..._ *V E R Y  I N T E R E S T I N G*
I wanna play this in survival peaceful. Just wanna embrace the beauty
Looks like it would be a fortnite map
Trixy : *video exist* Minecraft Youtubers : Yes
This is POG!
Tbh I hate the vanilla Minecraft world generation, I wish the whole game looked like yr world
how can i play in this world?
This is poggers
Sheeeeeesh im speechless . i dont play minecraft anymore but this is Epic
Really good job they should add this to minecraft
Wait... where are your eyelashes?
I hope you could include chests that support mods item spawns
Portuguese subtitles please
gg
New subscriber
This looks like a fortnite map
Send me the world I will send you the time i have survived in the world
Minecraft is an awesome game but it's community is 5 times incredible
you will hit 2m after this and even more
good work nice job
I have an IDEA: Make like a tree village in like idk where dark wood forest or jungle
Will the map be released for free to all subscribers once it is done?
you should add some easter eggs that reference some of your past builds, would be really cool.
what is the seed of the world
a good build to do in this map is also a modern city to explore with some kind of traps
Imagine if a speed runner spawned here...
are you going to have anything else help you with this?
It's beautiful
You are so talent
Really wanna looking forward to seeing how you'll transform the caves and mines!! Your builds are awesome, as always.
I really want to play Minecraft again, please do your best :D
What is the seed
80k ONLY DANG!!!!!!
Maybe add a huge cave entrance on the top of the biggest peak in snowy mountains biome where is gonna be a yetti or add a better version of the woodlint mansion in the forest
This guy wanted 80k like is getting 1miln in less than 2 weaks
Oh you wanted 80k  Ok We give  You 701k Now give us  The MaP!!!! Eeeee Edit: lol u did better than Mojang Edit 2: even tho Minecraft is infinity ish
You build 10 years to make new world to upgrade on survival world
How to download it?
80k likes???!!!!!! You deserve more than that bro  Love ur work keep it up 💪💪
Am i the only one who thinks the whole island looks a bit sus? Anyway,i'm waiting for the download,because imma add even more stuff from mods.  A suggestion: For the Taiga biome,add a village thats almost as big as the plains one,and are trying to connect to the plains one.
😍😍😍
add moyai statue🗿🗿 in jungle or near ocean
Who else gets fortnite vibes?
What time do you think the release will happen?
I want to play on rhid
" Dedication "
Thank u u have inspired me so much by this video and I tried it and it turned out very good and I’m very happy with my results so thank u for inspiring me
what programs do you use to make this?  i would love to learn!!  I've been making adventure maps on xbox since the 360 but i am limited to what can be done with bedrock.   i've made a few videos of the map i am working on. but your stuff puts my work to shame.
A giant golden spork
yooooo botw
Mi cara todo el video: :0
I can't even create a proper spiral staircase in my house wtf
Anyone know how he placed the trees like that?
You should make a modded version of the world
this reminds me of xbox 360 / ps3 era adventure games so good love the story too.
I feel like the plains needs a world tree
where can i find world painter?
This looks like it will be a stunning island when it is done! My one complaint is that in a world with killer monsters around every corner I would think even the smallest village would have some form of wall.
Where can we find the map?
When I seen the biome and the huge map it makes. I instantly thought of the OG Bionicle World of Mata Nui, but that's probably the inspiration behind it though. ^_^
Suggestion: This map could be used for something of a MMO server in Minecraft
Whats the name.of this build? My kids want it so bad, so do I.
I think a huge ravine would be sweet
Born too late to explore your previous builds, born too early to explore this one (jk I'm on your patreon now, I can't wait for this to drop)
Add a huge tree in the middle
You just got a sub and the bell, um impressed
The thumbnail is sus...
Small change but does the clerics wagon must atleast have 4 horses cus that wagon looks huge and look at the horses. They're probably champion horses.
when is part two
bruh minecraft should hire you
Please port this to bedrock or I’m gonna freak
If minecraft looked like this i would legit throw money at it
He should add a under water city
*Quaint Windmill*   Looks so much better than my endgame house 👊🥲
Jesus loves you
Woah this is just woah
You all subscribe
I look great on you except that the dolls that are in the pillager camps are not shooting tests but they are scare birds and those scare birds are a mockery of the pillagers towards the locked iron golems telling them that for the pillagers the iron golems are Simple scare birds that is why they get used to seeing in front of cages.     PS: I speak Spanish, I'm from Chile🇨🇱, I understand English but I'm not good at writing it, I'm using the google translator to say this, that's why there are spelling mistakes
Now why did I first thought of SAO's Alicization from the village transformation
Imaging adding create mod into this world
At first I tougt it was the fortnite map
Maybe for some lore you could have like a Nether cult that built the ruined portal to allow the forces of the Nether to come and destroy the overworld, but a group of heroes stopped them or something. Idk. Just seems cool to me
How can I play it?
This is an awesome and inspiring video. Thank you for the entertainment and inspiration! 🙏🙏
You should add fossils and different bones in the Mesa mines and just in caves. Also, Make like a top secret futuristic bunker deep, and I mean deep under ground, and make it full of weapons and loot, but hoooly should it be deep down, like maybe 2 1/2 Iron picks deep
You should add me in the snowy place
Vim pelo jazzghost
This is my first time watching your videos and I was like wow just wow and I subscribe like 3 mins in
80,000 likes? or 800,000 likes?
Just one question, will this be on bedrock?
The only time i would like to be a villager beacuse this guy made the village SO MUCH BETTER than my whole building history 🤣
I want to live in that world
Add a few hidden snowmen all around the entire map. Or just the snowy parts if you like
7:29 Whelp, I now know where I’m moving in for the survival world
I've had a good long pause, where I haven't felt like playing Minecraft. This gets me pumped up to play once the project is done. You've earn a follow from me, can't wait to see what's next!
Are you, perhaps, related to jeracraft?
How do we play it
Me who knows that savanna’s always spawn next to deserts but there’s a Mesa 😓 😓 😓😓😓😓😓😓
The second-hand policeman genotypically tug because den eventually test worth a productive supermarket. wary, four frail ear
You should add a massive world tree
e
i really like it and i like to download it
It would be really cool if the tallest mountain in the region is littered with canvases at the top. It would be called "Canvas Mountain" and legend says if you make it up there, you can paint the most beautiful picture in the world. Thing is, people don't realize they need to be able to paint. Somewhere there, there will be a small hole in the mountain where there is a beautiful painting and old supplies. It seems you don't need to reach the top to be the best! (Or somewhere there could be a weird pond that for some reason looks like the silhouette of... Bob Ross???)
This is insane let’s just appreciate all the time he spent on this.
The overt eel conspicuously report because theory occasionally tip an a odd second. delirious, questionable sandwich
I will definitely be streaming this survival map when it comes out
you should have made a village with an awesome and crazy looking ravine cracking through the surface
Can you make the ship wreck the titanic
This is so awesome! I mean I think I'm pretty good, but this is a whole other level!
Add lots of Rivers so we can have access to water. I don't want to walk 8 million blocks to get some water...
Daniel vs the coller Daniel
I swear, get this guy a job at Minecraft
Cant wait to play it when it's downloadable
Whats the seed?
Tribute to hades
Wano kuni?
Would this by chance be available on the switch version? I can see that this is made on pc, but was wondering if it would be available on the minecraft marketplace for the switch
This is exactly how you earn a subscriber. I love the whole idea of making your own world with your own style.
bro asked for 80k likes and rn has like 700k
I bet mr. Beast makes a 1000 player hide and seek on this map
I watched this video while i pooped and man this is the best video ive watched while pooping
Woah.. this is just.. damn..
Will there be ores to actually play?
This would be sick to play on VR
it would be awesome if you did a viking theme in the snowy area
I need more
PLEASE MAKE THIS MAP FOR POCKET EDITION TOO!!
This reminds me of Skyrim, you?
Bro.....           Why dont you work to mojang, Minecraft would be a 100% better.
Well happy 1.45 mil ive been subbed since the infinity war spaceship
Can some one make  a big map for 100 PvP battle royal ?
he should add a raided village in the dark oak forest and have a giant pillager base
Cant find the world download. Where at?
What texture pack is that
i can t wait i wanna try ur biom.
I am amazed and utterly exited for the finished product. I wish you the best of luck
Holy...moly...
Wait is this wano kuni ?
And the mushroom grand elders who "created this world" but however they where exploiting all the tribes and enslaved the snowy monster. The mushroom elders where then planing on enslaving the netherworld creatures for an army however a dark demon crawled out of the pits of the hellish world and destroyed the most of the tribes then retreated to the ocean because of the remaining pilligars overpowering them. The hellish creatures being a pigeon that mutated to breath under water and gain intelligence. The mushroom elders see this coming and hide deep underground beaneth the mushroom island...

@TrixyBlox I have not tested this myself but If you make Waterfalls and Volcanos block 36 might be an alternative choice to trap lava and water inside to glass and barrier blocks FitMC made a video showcasing how they are created called Bases are turning invisible

can you add a abandend tree house
Who disliked
He should also surround the village with walls because villagers are helpless and the pillagers are the enemies
Whenever you work in the desert and that . You should do a resemblance to the Wild West or something like that . Like the towns from red dead redemption 2.
Could you please make some steampunk relicts/structures to the Wild West biome,  I would absolutely love that. Btw, your work is absolutely breathtaking. I wish I could do that too, but my PC barely runs transitions between PowerPoint slides.
I’ve watched this 4 times and I still love it 😊 (it’s super cool)

You really are an amazing dude, man! And I think that you shall win the "best Minecraft builder of world", this is my opinion, anyway I have got an advice to you, it will be so sad destroying those magnificent trees, so I think that you shall build a small house, with mine and normal Vanilla trees, to the player, I really hope that you will put the download to this world, because it's looking really good.

how to download map
I know this won't be seen but I'd personally love a floating island somewhere, perhaps several chained together beyond the mushroom biome in the ocean area, perhaps it has its own foreign made biome or maybe it has a weird structure meant to worship the End?
This is a GTA5 type map when it comes to detail! Great job dude, can’t wait to play it!
what is the next biom?
Don't forget Shreks swap

Mojang taking notes: 📃🖋📃🖋📃🖋📃📃🖋📃🖋

Alguém BR?
sorry but they sent it to me 😥 I'm sorry to send you this, but now that you've opened it you can't stop reading it. Hello, my name is Teresa Fidlago. I died 27 years. If you don't send this to 20 people, I'll sleep next to you forever. If you don't believe me, look for me. Teresa Fidlago. So send this to 20 people. A girl ignored this and her mother died 20 days later. DO NOT SEND BACK !!!! # copied. Sorry, I had to send this. By the way, this is not false to google it. Someone sent this to me and I had to do the same, I don't risk ignoring this message, tell me why this keeps happening. Another grandmother read this and sent it to 20 people, but the internet went away on the 19th. She was found cut into 5 pieces after 1 day. Make sure to send all 20
1 thing you missed the swamp
hi, i'm from brazil i saw the video and thought the project was really cool, about the ideas of what you can do on this map i think it would be cool to have a cave with frozen dinosaurs, sorry if the comment is difficult to understand =)

I am a very handsome Moose
Wow! This projekt has so many deatails. I love it!
could you make this as a mod? to change the natural generation
you could make a giant labyrinth in the jungle biome's mountain/underground area and have there be a sacred jewel at the end
This is a very lovely project. Please, a Genshin Impact (a beloved game of many people nowadays) reference like only one village, where the main them is magic. We would exchange many potions, find fighting items, with a statue reference of a god. Please. I beg youuuuu ToT
Will I be able to play on Xbox 1?
You should do a patreon. I'd definitely donate. Especially with all that time your investing to make a world that you'll let us download and a play in the future.

You should add a giant tree in the plains biome. One that goes into sky's! Also some side islands would be great! Maybe a ice spikes biome in the ocean
Underground ice cave!
Petition to make this biomes the normal look of minecraft
i got an idea make a old broken train bridge in dark oak forest connect of the mesa train
Yo that pillager outpost looks sick man 7:19
It’s just Ark now
They should hire Trixy as a Mojang builder
There is no such thing as the mesa biome it's the badlands biome
an ice expadition camp in the ice biome would be cool
When they added the broken portals was it inspired by the SOI series?
Download?

You could hide some bedrock-encased herobrine themed command blocks at the bottom of the world; I don't think I've seen anyone reference him in awhile.
Definetely try and make underground biomes
As a Dutchman, I really like the design of the windmill. Good job!
playing this with shaders would be INSANE using this map with a better villagers mod would also be really cool
a cave system that leads to an ancient temple would be pretty cool, maybe for jungle or snowy biome
Just Superb. . .
Please build a big  mosque btw love your content
I can't play this map, because my buildings would look shit near yours :(
I feel like this would be s good ark servival type map
Wow
There was a massive smile of excitement on my face this whole entire video
I needed an overhaul like this in minecraft
i dont know why the island remind me of dababy
Will you make a custom Nether/end That would be really cool
This island looks like a circleish australia XD
frist Channel i turned on my notifications on for
i have an idea if you continue with the project this mushroom island can be connected to the normal map with a bridge but there are several pilliger posts in front of this bridge That would just be an idea of ​​mine😁

I want part 2
will be one of the coolest maps ever
Next video: the whole earth, I dare you? :D
I definitely think you should make it, so that you can plant the big oak trees with saplings, like with the jungle tree where you put 4 next to each other to make the large ones.
Part 2
When you started making the world I was reminded of watching Bob Ross paint. Then you mentioned him lol, that was awesome.

Is there part 2 ?
How to download the map bro
Amazing
jesus nice
HOW CAN SOMEONE DISLIKE WTF
the effort put into this is incredible, that's why he deserves to be respected, liked, getting more subs etc.....
Along with breath of the wild this kind of reminds me of Genshin Impact !!! I’ll 100% be playing this when it comes out
TrixyBlox when his map isn't 100k blocks and don't have epic castles, citiees, underground empires and kingdoms: "I'm not used to build in so small proportions"
Looks amazing!  Maybe add a swamp on the coast between the jungle and dark oak forest?  Just a thought, love the build!
The trees are realistic because trees are usually that big
Uhm... maybe this is an idea for the savanna: an indian tripe
Hope you will add another mega built - Underwater, - Aquaman style
wwwwwooooowwwww
AAA I am super excited to play this map
OMG!! I CANT WAIT TO PLAY THIS WORLD...This is actuallythe world that i really want
This seems like a Catan board I would buy. No hesitation lol
I'd love to use this map for an SMP where leaders controlled biomes and could start wars, theres an economy and the mushroom  island is like alcatraz
make sure to smash 80k likes... here he is sitting on 600k
I wish mojang would copy some of your creations so minecraft would look better😅😅
you should put wagons around the map with a cleric inside it like its actually travelling
CEO of Minecraft be like :  . . . . 😦
Bruh he doesn’t deserve 1 million subs, he deserves 10 mil
Make fossil sites in the desert!
When it is released I'd be too scared to chop the trees their too pretty-
Can't wait to see how this plays with mods. I suggest some more fantasy inspiration with supernatural creatures like vampires and werewolves
460k subs in 1 week becuz of these😎👏
13:43
And add like different races if you can
can we play in this map once it's done? if so that's so freaking cool!
If you can, you should make a custom nether and end. It’s quite a big wish but if you do then god knows how long it took.
Are we gonna be able to download it? Would be fun :D
Add Magic and floating islands in the jungle
That it. I'm making it my realm
transform the nether when you enter the portal
Sunflower field. WE NEED IT!
I wish this was a part of Minecraft
When this is completely done, you need an entire video of all the episodes combined, this is so relaxing and satisfying
Part 2?
Dowlond Link??
Build my girlfriend please
The Bigger , The Better😃
TrixyBlox How do you do this on Minecraft pocket edition please tell me if you can respond I would be grateful
You should be the head map designer for mojang
This is insane
I literally loved your map not infinite, peaceful, and in the middle of the sea ❤❤❤❤
POV: You haven't seen the sun in years
I would want to play this biome with my friends but I only can do load it from Google bc I don't have money to buy the actual Minecraft so I can't login 😢😢😢😢
The careful neck conversantly match because apple annually scatter versus a lopsided war. ruddy, kindly airplane
Is 1:30 AM right now and I saw this and I was like oh this is it my watch later I guess I’ll watch it now and I was almost asleep during the video but then I started actually paying attention and this is the best thing I’ve ever seen and I can’t wait for part two!
wow this is so cool okokokokokokkokkkkkkkk ill subscribe cuz just look at that this is the best vid ever diyfoucuifuvidycgin🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍😍😁😁😁😁 this is a🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What is the thing at the beginning of the video? Is it really possible to create an MC map with a custom shape like that?? pls explain to me
This is epic
Bro the Church does look like the temple of time
This looks amazing, cant wait
Can i download this world somewhere?
**Looks at the likes**  Do you think he got 80k?
Im amazed so creative
Holy....
Maybe a westernlike mineshaft?
Is there a link on a map?
This Better Than The Mine Craft Build but Love There Effort
nice upload when its ready pls
Your so awesome. Keep up the great work. It's unbelievable how talented you truly are.
What if you put a whole chuck where it’s all diamond ore with only 1 layer of dirt but you don’t show where you put it on the next vid so it will be a cool and good thing to find and probably make a diary Entergy on the towns folk suspecting it’s a thing and there trying to look for it
gives such skyrim vibes if my pc had upgrades i’d download this in a second😯
Can i dowload this map?
hey, I'm new to the channel so I don't really know how you usually scale the buildings to their surroundings, but imo, some of the buildings are bigger than the rest (the neighborhood). For example the church is kinda big for that size of the village. And so does the Pillagers' tower.
This honestly reminds me of lemmings island. Honestly a really old reference but still
You could make some ruins around the map
It's absolutely amazing how you changed a normal quite boring plains biome into that masterpiece, the village is hands down beautiful and the detail in the pillager outpost is magnificent 👌.  Not to mention the Over exaggerated yet amazing ruined portal is amazing...idk how you have the patience or the time to do all of that so cudos to you
You forgot a blacksmith  apart from that all i can say is epic
He is so creative
I so will be using this map as soon as your done with it :o
Holy smokes this is so impressive
Someone better make a killer MMORPG out of this world when it is completely finished.
Commenting for algorithm but also this is my favourite minecraft content so am definitely waiting for more.
You should add a trading ship out in the water
*the ultimate minecraft isekai.*
Aaaand this just makes my builds look like a pebble in the gravel
What would be really cool would be if you made a Valhalla/heaven like arena 800 or so blocks offshore and around max block height that maybe one of the Northern Tribes hints to you about. You can even make the area of ocean beneath ifmt incredibly dangerous by placing an abnormal amount of mob spawners in that area of the ocean. I suggest the actual floating island should be filled to the brim with Emerald and Gold and Redstone, but have very few essential ores such as Iron or Gold or Diamond. Maybe you could even place the End Portal there! So when players use eyes of Ender and they fly off into nowhere like wtf and are totally mystified.
Hey can ya please provide a download link of that world bro i want it so baddddd.. Im bad at building so im gonna copy block to block from you and then try my own ideas...hope thats okay
i'd suggest you could include a stronghold design from your previous videos.
i love this an im hoping for a part 2
I know you probably won't see this and this is kind of a dumb idea but what about in the snow biome there's a village that's completely covered by snow
This ain’t Minecraft is 𝕞𝕚𝕟𝕔𝕣𝕒𝕗𝕥
I think it’s funny he asked for 80k and got over 600k more
Why do I see the impostor in the map at the beginning of the video 📮📮📮
The lowly jute advisably fear because psychology early amuse beneath a horrible bath. useful, ugliest cry
The tittle of the video must be "fixing minecraft"
God I am so gonna play this when its done
Maybe you could add a Meteor Impact in the mountains or in the plains
It was giving a feeling  of atack on titan the upgraded  vanilla village
4:03 you need to take that big lake to your advantage and maybe make a deep hole that goes far deeper into that lake and much adventure goes into it and just things like Atlantis or something, I got this idea from Banjo Tooie when banjo had to go to this very deep lake that took him into many adventures
Lol he said 80thousand likes and he got so much more Idk about you but I'm one of them 😁
Maybe add a strong hold somewhere?
You should make this available on bedrock and Java for the world download
will this map be available on pc only or for all Minecraft versions or just some? ( if you make it for mobile can you please make it free to download, I’m only asking because I don’t have a pc or fast internet at home, and I’m asking this for everyone in the same or in a similar scenario.
i just hope it'll be for bedrock too
World download please :(
Jegueghost
Next stop on the grand line
It looks like one of those isekai anime where there are dungeons in the world.
Throughout the plains biome or any biome really, you could put lil tents and fire places around With villagers, cozy Quaint Areas? Kinda sounds weird And Pointless but It’s Just A Thought 💀 now Im going to go binge your other videos :,)
Wow this is really good you should definitely make more of these! it's so cool to see other people's building Style, sometimes I take bits and pieces and use it for my  builds. 8.7\10 AMAZINGGGGG
Pretty soon Jeb going to have to realize who you are....  For real...  I'm not the only one who wishes see those trees and stone boulders in their minecraft world lol
Please add some big dungeon...
So this map will actually be playable? To the public? For free? Sign me up! Give me a plot to make my mark on the world! :D
Miscalculated the expected likes too. Awesome work
You and Grain should colab
YOU- HOW- WHAT
Make a mosque in the desert
All this is amazing
Maybe instead of playing Minecraft you should brush your teeth
New Fortnite map leaked yes
will this map be free
I want more of this
would it be possible to get it without the structures just the biomes
name the places
SUS WHEN IMPOSTOR SUS AMOGUSS
Sadly im a bedrock player😭
Would you be able to obtain the adventure time achievement with this world? I was thinking having the more obscure biomes (like bamboo jungles) could serve as pretty secret areas to encourage exploring every part of the map.
Turns the cleric into a mysterious "Travellers Merchant" The actual Wandering Trader 😐
I thought it was fortnite😂
This isn’t clash of clans my dude nice builds tho
When do yall think hes gonna finish?
Thats so coool!!!!
what you should do with the windmill is bring in the create mod and make it move or anything else that you think that might need to move
Me discover´s this channel and watch this as first video can´t wait for the Complete series  also me saying Holy every 20 seconds when he starts to build something new
O jazz tava certo

1 million special: I'm upgrading literally everything in minecraft.   2 million special: I'm upgrading literally everything in minecraft and building it in insane detail.

this is so good, I can imagine camping under one of those big boulders in the plains with a campfire
a giant dessert temple
A masterpiece
He just make everything bigger, better and more aesthetic
#jazzghost
im excited to potentially play on this world
That looks like a fortnite map
do worlds created with world paint break low pcs ? cuz I really wanna try it
Make one of the biome’s villages have a huge wall around it. The lore would be that the villagers think somthing is out there and refuse to leave. Maybe dark oak biome
Please release this map for bedrock too. Also, having an uprgade in the nether, the end and the fortress where the end portal is would be dope. Amazing work! You just earned a new subscriber :)
You should add a cave system under the island
Should this map post in minecraft story mod
Have a 3090 with Minecraft for when my Nephews visit. Never played and will finally play it when you drop this project. Respect.
TrixyBlox probably works for Mojang, and this is just leaking everything in the 1.37 overhaul update.   (joke)
Spectacular!
Freaking good recommendation that YouTube gave me! Wooow amazing project! Love it.  I can't wait to play on that world is like ten or even more times better than normal Minecraft world... Good work man! Keep it going!!
Can a Download These survival map?
Can you add a secret underground city?
Ngl I would probably live in village houses if this was in Minecraft 😅
Van you do an apocalipsys Map?
I need 80k likes… 600k likes later

I feel like this is gonna go viral and everyone is going to be playing it when it comes out.
Why isn’t this guy in hermit craft he is just amazing
I really hope you do similar builds for Hytale when it comes out.
I don’t even play Minecraft but your beautiful designs have brought me back. I will become a patron when I get a job 🙏
Kinda looks like a Settlers of Catan board game
The desert would look cool with a mosque
brush your teeth
I hope this world is free

I came here on the Brazilian jazzghost channel and I really liked the video
We hit 80K! Gib gib gib gib gib gib gib
Everyone chillin watching the farms being built until the villagers show up and actually start using them
Damn this guy deserves way more that 1 mil subs
I cannot wait until the next update!
You're crazy
This sounds like it would be fun to play. Would this work with bedrock?
OK
we really need this to be available for download <3
Ahh 600.000 likes chillig
Holy shit this is awesome.
I intend to play in the world but I don't now how to put the code in Minecraft and I'm playing on Xbox could anybody help me please thanks.
This is so Crazy.
dude 678k likes do ANOTHER ONE
Wow your so good at building
It is a masterpiece.
I'm in this for the Bob Ross Reference
MOJANG PQP PQ CE N FAZ UMA ATUALIZAÇÃO DESSA MAN NAMORAL OLHA Q TROÇO LINDO VEI
It's good that you don't go to crazy with to much extra detail it really looks ugly in voxel art when you try to add to many different colors and textures in 1 place
this looks amazing when is it going to be out!?
Quem veio aqui pelo jazz
Where Strong Hold?
Yo when can we download this? Insane build seems ultra fun to play on!
I hate when people build trees with anything besides regular logs planks ruin the look of them
Me watching it at 3 am and getting hyped. I want to download it so much.
you should do in mesa one secret: Delorean Time Machine
Ala rctmr ta RE piola tu webada mano pa cuando sale, X q no entendi ni mais WE
oh my fucking god bro. you're insane
I can’t wait to play this once's it is out
Thankyou man, im getting so frustrated at these battle royale games. This would help me so much to enjoy gaming again!
Add a castle in the dark wood forest.
Put really good rtx on your pc and you can live on your computer
Jesus is that beautiful
Idea crashed UFO in the snowy mountains that was transporting a creature that survived the crash but is dead and  some villager reports of the creature before it died or it can still be alive it. Maybe a destroyed pillager outpost from the creature.

You should add a giant cave somewhere filled with secrets
U r crazy
Mojang should hire builders like you so that you can help create a world in Minecraft with much better looking structures in the overworld.
whats it called did he release it now-
I have a question can you be at more Village in areas please
Dude you need to work for Mojang
Is this a Download map
Is there a way to download the word without the buildings, like just the land, I'd love to make an smp with this
seed?
It would be cool if you would add a swamp biome as like a minei biome withine one of the bigger biomes
If there is a term called hacker then it's just for you bro
Make sure to add some ocean biomes like coral reafs maybe
ngl u like dollar store david dobrik
Part 2 please
Pleaseeeee make this free that's all I want
You should convert the world to bedrock and put it on the marketplace
watched the entire ads without skipping for this guy just because this is gonna be an amazing map
Another amazing video and well deserved views! My only concern is 9:44 curvy farm looks super cool but is very impractical. Farmers need straight lines to plow efficiently and organize their crops in equal rows for a trackable manner. Also land plots tend to be divided with straight lines bordered by fencing. Everything else is amazing though, just wanted to help aide to the realism.
Oh damn, this is amazing
part 2???
Cries in Bedrock. This looks so cool....
Bro if you do more. U can like make it as a story game.
Nice
Part 2
This is such a cool project. Really excited to see more of it!
sepillate los dientes suciooooooo!!!!
"Make sure to get this video to 80K likes". This is so awesome
Downvoted the vid because of the description. I dont trust someone who keeps their videos behind "Like-walls". Likes is something you get because it was enjoyable to watch, not a monetary bill to be used in exchange for services, I mean come on, what the hell, if your vid is even half as good as it looks like in the intro and how good people say the video is, you dont need that sort of crap.
wano kuni  be like:
Trixy you and another good minecraft builder named fwhip should have a build off
Part 2!!!! PART 2!!!!!!!!
Will it be available on ps4?
Pretty legit as always. It'd be awesome to see big khmer style temples in the jungle. And perhaps a humble Puritan-esque village in the taiga?
What about an arena in the middle island and, somewhere, an underground templ?
How can we play that map?
Mojanv if u see this pay that man MONEYYYY and enploy him now.
This low key like a fortnite map
Do you think you could make like an iton golem factory sending iron golems to a pillager outpost
Will the world download be free?
OMG SEND THIS TO MOJANG RIGHT NOW
The thumbnail looks like the old Ali-A "NEW SEASON _ MAP PREDICTION"
He be like Mom why is my pc on fire?
This build looks awesome!!
trixy’s builds are so inspiring and fun to watch
Geez he is soooooooo skilled!!
Hi my name is Steve's Grandmaaaaaaaa :D
I love it your the BEST!!! 😍
An idea to make the shape seem a little more natural, shave off a small part of the southern tip of the desert and make the mushroom island a triangle shape to make it look like the mushroom biome separated from the mainland.
This video is the second highest views of all videos! 🥳
Where to download this world
When its finished. Will it be for everyone to download or patreons only?
*Please give the seed of this world when you are finished making it*
free download?
What software or website did he use to draw the world before populating it with buildings and other things?
vim pelo jazzghost 👍
it’d be cool to see a makeshift village on the hanging on the cliffs of the canyons or other biomes with high mountains
You can build a broken down old building maybe from war a long time ago
p a r t 2 p l z
What I would really like to see in the snow biome is some sort of Yeti's lair with kidnapped villagers and rabid wolves, maybe a frozen in ice dragon too!
I'm hesitant to download this when its finished I don't have a beasty PC all I have is a Xbox and a Samsung Galaxy s7 edge
Bunker
How do I build better in Minecraft
Can you past this in the minecraft store so we can buy this for a survival world in ps and xbox
What version is it going to be released in, or can I update the version it’s in after I download it?
This guy is making Minecraft a rpg open world game man amazing :o
I would also intend to play this in survival when I have the chance
Will this world be free to play ??
Two ideas, a underground mushroom land that spans a majority of the map(glowing fungus would be cool) and mount Olympus floating above the mountains  hidden by clouds
Are u gonna change the end and nether too?
If you would upgrade the ocean with corals and lamps, that would be sick
*Confuse twerking*
why dont you put an dead ice dragon in the ice biome with treasures around it
I'm so hyped I've seen the video 14 times
The View Just Keep Rooling Inn
When is the next video going to be posted? I keep looking everyday hoping today is the day
HURRY I WANT TO PLAY THIS MAP NOWWWWW
I think grian might have a rival..
just so good dude..... gonna need the map download asap so I can live my dream and binge minecraft with buddies again.
Why do they always uses pyramid with eyes? That's clearly illuminati, are you a illuminati?
This video reminds me of the legend of Zelda breath of the wild exploration and map creativity  Edit: I just watched the video a little bit more and you just mentioned the legend of Zelda breath of the wild
Mmmmmm looks good
SHEEEEEEEEEEESH.
80k LMAOOO U THOUGHT
why does it give AOT vibes
How to copie struktutes?
This is absolutely insane! Hope u will finish it man!
Miscalculated?! Well, i mean, the bigger the better.
I don't know how to react to this. This is honestly the greatest Minecraft build ever
6.2 mil likes in one week 👁👄👁
So I’m Not The Only one wondering how long this took
1:52 what kind of program? Is it World Painter?
I'm not even sure if this is possible, but could you add some Herobrine  lore into the world?
This man has Just reinvented Minecraft. Wow Mojang could Take an example
this is dope af
the village gives me assassins creed valhalla vibes
Would like to see you revisit using mods to decorate things  I would recommend little tiles. last i checked, it worked better than Chisels and Bits, there was even connected textures support so glass didn't look super wonky.  Pretty sure there was other features, I.E. slanted pieces, which is.. weird.
Please provide link of your world please
i would love to do these kind of things but my computer is so bad and i just dont have enough time
nice
Challenge: build without commands and mods
Can I help plan what seed I what to help
I wish I knew how to build like this
Take your time brother😀

Man asks for 80k likes,  1 week later,  674k likes... people know what they want lol
How to download this map on Minecraft

How to download this map?
He must send it out to us
I LOVE THIS
Im sorry bro, i can't press the like button more than one time
Make this a mod for super craft/foxy craft its two games and minecraft plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.
I love these videos but inside the project it feels very empty
This is great already! I intent on playing it when it finishes
Hmmm🤔 will the villagers cluster into the library at some point in the afternoon?
Some cross-pollination between biomes would be cool. Like if biome x doesn’t have a resource, but biome y does. So villagers from biome x go to biome y and you might see an item you wouldn’t normally find biome y. Like a cactus in the mountains. I hope I’m not too late for a suggestion.
Minecraft should hire you as a developer. The game would be way better
I want this world so bad
So good I can wait for the next one when it comes out
Once this comes out does anyone want to make and SMP out of it?
THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL
Its the guy from fortnite
Anyone know when this will be finished or atleast have an estimate?
up side down T
Where i can download the Minecraft World?
trixy why dont u make mods too cause usualy u make things OP so if u make mods and make it even it will be a better game
An idea: you should build a Pride rock from The Lion King
So damn talented. Just whAt-
Can i request, can you upgrade the End City
where i can download map?
This is what Minecraft Story Mode wished it would be
I really think you should model the temple/church in the desert village on the Desert Temple, it would really tie it in to the island lore.
You should add a giant tree in the plains biome. One that goes into sky's! Also some side islands would be great! Maybe a ice spikes biome in the ocean
This looks beautiful.
WOW
trixy: asks for 80k likes "gets 675k likes" 🤯🤯
When he makes the cleric a wandering villager that's already in the game. Dude c'mon you can't just steal my man's role like that.
people like you have to WORK for mojang you are an irl GOD !   Greatest project in the minecraft history by TrixyBlox
where's the episooooode twooooo
gg bro
This is a Epic masterpiece
The fact that they asked for 80 000 likes but the video has 673 000 likes after like a week
There is no other words that could describe this better than a master piece. Minecraft worldbuilding reaches a point where it becomes art. This is a clear example of it. I will wait impatiently for the release!
Gorilla
How will you be able to add in natural spawning for the pasted vanilla structures?
Man hwo did u have so much time to do this bro that amazing man can u teach me how to build such amazing world or can u make a video on how to design ur Minecraft server because this world which u designed can be also made in server man it's amazing love bro 🤜❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cant wait for the download
does anyone know how to download this map?
Imagine if minecraft actually was like this.. that would be EPIC!!
Can i have the would?
If my programming skills were any good (Which they aren't) I'd code in a system which makes the different biomes harder (For example plains is the easiest, mobs do less damage, and then desert would be harder, mobs to increased damage, etc.) and make it like a leveling system for added linearity to the games progression
Wow.... Didnt wxpect this to be hos latest video at his 1M special and its not exact 1M anymore but 1.44M
Just wanted to know if there are any witch huts on the map
is there a way this could be turned into a mod?
This YouTuber is super calming and incredibly talented. Legitimately enjoyed this video.
80 000 ? More like 700 000😂👍🏻
maybe a cave in the water source of the first village could be cool
Me crying in bedrock
when is the new part of this coming out
BAAAAAAAAB
nieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
What program did u use to create the map?
can you make a tutorial on how to be a good builder like you??
Not to be greedy but I wonder if he will transform the End or Nether to match the Overworld style. Either way this looks awesome
what program did you use??
Dude your videos are simply awesome
Can you do pt.2 please
Will you be doing a custom nether and stronghold/end?
Wow amazing 🤩 please send me this so I can play on it in Minecraft pocket edition on my phone please?!?!?!?!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Floating Island :( plzzz maybe a fantasy themed kingdom there? u could also link them with chains & dangerous bridges
i feel like there should be one nether portal, or the portals could have a way of transportation,(like telelporters in several games) fast travel stuff, idk i m just typing
this is amazing
Something cool would be that in order to beat the game and kill the dragon, you would need to solve a riddle that can only be answered with every diary and puzzle pieces in the map
insane
Please can you do a map of the Lord of the kings? Thanks
him: "get this to 80k"  the viewers: "no. 673"
this reminds me so much of Teyvat !!! great work !!!

Make this for bedrock pls
I am exciting for this map
This is SUPER dope dude!
U need to build a stronghold and not show the location.. And then transform the end two
Wow I'm very impressed I will play this version of minecraft
11:00 Wouldn't it have been better to locate the quarry on the edge of the village? Or, at least, not directly at it's center?
Where’s part two? Jk I know it takes a long time keep on making good content man
:awesome:
This feels like a fantasy RPG world. I like it
Bro. Idea! Make ender world look more mysterious atc I’ll wait a year. Ok?)
If u want help I can help you in this project
Will this be free to download
Great video, love what you've made. I don't play mine craft for anything but just making cool structures. I really wanna try out world edit now and mess around
May you publish this on bedrock Minecraft ?
Do colaboration with JeraCraft please 🙏

Can’t wait to play it!
Not as enormous as Pippins but since he’s doing it alone and theres intricate details among all there is. I gave this a 20 diamonds out of 24.
The second o saw that windmill, I was like thats going in my world. I'll give you the credit I promise. Ad what an amazing project, can't wait to see the rest
My Minecraft Addiction has been revived!
How can I download the map?

So to build nice environments, you need city planning skills too..... Gotcha
Oh wow cool! Hope when i get minecraft i get to play this its so cool.
Can you collaborate with weiderdude
Wish you the best luck when this comes out
Mountain pass
Will you put the map to download? I need it.
Can you release this as a map?
Can you make a modpack, that makes trees generate like the ones you make? I just think that would be amazing.
Its a cool proyect and all but... the isle looks like a croissant
#pashmam
When are u going to Reilly ir
I'd love to see a medieval city with a feudal theme.
Is he gonna upgrade the nether too
For the weebs out there, add a anime easteregg. well, my hero academia is on the run now I suggest a easteregg on that.

W O W
will you release for download? please
The mineshaft will be upgraded too, right?
0:00 AMOUNGUS
Upgrade Nether to😁
I hope this isn't only for patrons available.
Please put download link
I think that original Minecraft village misses the part to tell the golem story to us. It's just a golem defending the village. That's all. Maybe you'll do something around that idea to tell us more about mythical village defenders on your map
I want play dis map
now that looks like RPG game's Map xd
Pls have a trap
Don t forget ...a trap
I need this. Now.
I'd be cool if u would add shipwrecks around one of the beaches and when player would go investigate what happened not far from beach he would find the remains of great sea battle between ship fleet and sea monster which skeletal structure would be that big it even shows not so far above sea level
If i was you, personally, i would add a uncharted mineshaft, maybe chaos town, you know, the one from telltales story mode? i dont think you know it, and also maybe a quest of sorts. Im not sure though...
Im quite shocked. This is so mesmerising to me. Want to know why? Well, let's just say, im quite bad at building. And that means that i would rather live in a shack this guys built, than a mansion i built. Its that bad. Again, im shocked. And rather speechless.
80k is absolutely smashed
WHEN ??????
When the island is sus
Where is the dowload link???
Add in an underwater cave
Wooww...! Minecraft should hire u... U r vry creative...i would ply it niceee

I think 80k likes is about done
Absolutely amazing. The time and effort is astounding to me. Love it! Will this world work in the bedrock edition?
Make one place in the snow biome that will be a QR Code leading to Never Gonna Give You Up.
I came back after a week to see if the like goal was completed and we smashed the goal so we’re German a part two its gonna be fun
Need world download link!!!
What is the seed please
Remember when minecraft was just a funny game with creeper and cows ? Now when i watch this, i'm just like "damn, it's like a whole fantasy world" you could make a map off a fantasy book and make it alive and legit.
I AM SO PUMPEDDD FOR THISSSSSS

Make a server of this map , That would be great!
You work so hard and pug so much determination into your builds I think this deserves more subs than oeople on earth
Man your so skilled, something like this is a dream for one to create. Can't wait for this to be completed!
At the end you accidentally deleted world
Hey mate, what if you add your Custom regions/biome? Maybe a semi-modern underground Town/city, with technologies and iron mines. Heavily inspirated by Piltover & Zaun from LOL  And, you can add restricted places, and let the player gear up before travel to those specific location, you can add Forbidden/Dangerous marks, with strong mobs, or terrain conditions. That'll be sweet.  And what about the underground areas? More than the technology city, what if there is underground forgotten civilization? Where mobs live underground, and there, held artifacts.  And i think, other islands woukd be cool, don't make it as big as this main island lol, just add some. Like normal island, pirates, and more.  If it was TL;DR, add more variation and fantasy, dont make it crazy, just make it colorful. This project is wonderful and almost limitless to our imagination.  Edit : I can imagine you adding mysterious statues that already rot, moldy, and rusty, some of them broken. It'll add more for the lores. And add more to the end and nether. Give us surprises and goosebumps!
I want it now
Very cool
I just saw a lets play of RE8 village and I think it would be amazing to create a castle like the dimitrescu one even though it seems complicated
I want to play this map. Im looking forward to see more. You should update the map when the caves and cliffs update is there. And i would love to see a massive cave system, maybe connected with the mines. Some smaller caves and some bigger caves, some hidden secrets etc.  Edit: This is how minecraft vanilla should look like. But if it would look like this, we wouldnt have this awesome videos.
Like from Russia, very beautiful work man RESPECT! ✊🏻🇷🇺❤️
Hey man!! Thatlook amazing!!!
Can you give me this map?  I want to play this beautiful map :)

How can I learn to build like this? It looks amazing and I am very jealous that my build skills are nothing more than an advanced dirt house :|
YouTube algorithm blessing me with this masterpiece. I couldn't even imagine how much hours goes into this 😅 I truly hope your viewers are patient and appreciate your ambitious project when it's released. Make sure to take breaks, and I wish you luck on finishing the rest😬👏
well the villagers are thriving
I don't think this is the ultimate minecraft survival map, I think you made the entire map of Tamriel instead, just a compliment.

Create a way to mirror world, and keeps that way hidden somewhere

Can you put a sign in the hub that says hi for me plz, can’t wait to play it
This is so amazing! In terms of the nether portal, will there be anything in the nether? Maybe a forgotten civilisation or where villagers were banished?
Where is download link ?
In the dark wood you could make a Fortress like Dul Guldor from the Hobbit
I need this..... such an amazing idea!!
I always wanted to know. Does being a yotuber help in building structures. Does it help to play minecraft? Does it help to have motivation?

Get to 80k likes.  *sees 665k likes*  Hmm
Underground cave city
I’ve seen like half of your builds before on social media but I never knew who the builder was and that they were all made by the same guy. Incredible stuff!
This project is just insane! It's crazy to think about how much time people put into making these builds. Mad props! 😁
This is just unreal! And then there's me, who can barely build a normal-looking house. XD 😂
Can you all stop asking for a download link? It's his decision where he wants to upload his own map
Plese read my idea. Is it nice ?? 👇
This is gonna feel like The Forest when modders gets their hands on this
Now this is what i want in minecraft
how to play in this map you created man so cool i am on switch if we can download this map plz tell me
let me download the map
😦
This is what I want my world to truly be I can have an elf villages, dwarf caves, and more species establishments.
Hope we get some custom villagers! Since you have beekeepers and stone... breakers- villagers with trades that reflect that would be really neat!
Is there ever gonna be Xbox support?

Upgraded Trees? Tf do they give off, oXygen Pro Max Ultra?
Honestly looks like a video game map
what did you use to make the map?
Minecraft colab with breath of the wild ? Wow :))))
I think mojang should do this
MAKE THIS INTO A SERVER OMG
You're building this ALONE? This is insanity.
You should  use this map,make it giant and then paste in all your minecraft structure redesigns! It would look awesome!!!
Ill be cool if u add an tall tall grass minibiome in plains and a beach with a small village and a lighthouse, also ill be cool a pirate boat with villages in the port
@forgelabs
in the taiga or snowy mountains theres a tutorial on how to make a statue of a dragon do that
It looks like wano country from one piece
I'm gonna be the poor citizen when I built my house next that village
Any waterfalls
Im soo happy watching this vid
Hmm yes 80,000 likes not 663k likes
You could make an hour long video and I would watch it all tbh
I might be out of line here… but sense this is your 1 mil special can you just consider releasing it for free? I know you gotta make a profit and you put a lot of work into this but your also getting a lot of foot traffic and huge sub growth from this video so its not like it’s a waste of time. It would mean a lot to everyone in your community if you just thought about it.
you should try the TerraForged mod. its a terrain generating mod that although wont compare to your projects does give an ultra realistic vibe that sometimes remind me of places from the real world. i now cannot play this game without it.
#TrixyBloxforMojang
You should add a Broken bridge to the mushroom island
No Body: Me: intsalling Shader + MMORPG Mod + More Mob + Creature + more Biome + RPG item + realistic mod
Bro u are another level!
yeah this is definitely worth a sub. can't wait to see the end result
Omg
make an indian style base / house , i have never seen indian style house or base so it who be cool
if TrixybBlox doesn't get 2mill in 1 month then I will eat my mask.
WOOOW
Can you please send a link for this map? Thanks
🇲🇾
You got yourself a new subscriber. I can’t wait to get ahold of the world and play in it. My interest of Minecraft had been diminishing but this world would surly keep me goin
Wait 6 million views?
We it be for Xbox and psp4
Why did this look like a parrot
It would be so cool if you decided to transform the nether structures somehow
So what can we do
Can't wait for this to be finished lol  This is so coooooooooool
I neeed to play in that map plz 😂😂😂
You asked for 80k views... You got 600k+.... I think this deserves 1M..... Amazing video
trixy; a quaint windmill also trixy; proceeds to build the greatest windmill ive ever witnessed
What is the app u use
damn this blew up
I can’t wait for part 2
Vim pela jazzghost
80,000 likes? hes making a 2 hour video soon probably
Tresure is my thing make a cave with tresure  hidden some were good
What is the name of the server
i wonder if there is gonna be a rp server that uses this map
Criminally under rated
Map idea, have all the biomes have different “puzzle pieces” and have a big puzzle to “unlock” the end portal
I love how he creates a gargantuan god build and then goes “a quaint windmill”
will this be available for mobile ?
The Mushroom island should be a prison island. In the snowy mountains, there will be a hidden entrance to the Nether. The Nether will house a cult of exiled villagers who worship Herobrine and believe that he will come to the world and destroy all the non-believers and bring peace and harmony to the believers and show them the way to the Aether.
Uh...whats with the 100Days tag?
DUDE THIS IS AMAZING!!! Can’t wait to see this map complete
just....how do you get so GREAT at building stuffs in minecraft u inspired me but I kinda bad at building
This is literally the coolest video I have seen in a long time... can’t wait for the rest of this!
If this isn't minecraft 2.0, I don't know what is.
This would be great if it had small mods/plugins like MMO skills.
you should make OOO from adventure time

i wish a have a computer so ican download and play this map with my friends😞😞😞
Is there a world download for this?
This map sounds like the plan me and a friend had to make a map like this and then open it up as a roleplay survival multiplayer.
This is grian 2.0
heres some ideas!!   1. i was thinking you could make up your own way that humans (such as villagers) came to be for lore purposes-   2. you could make the mushroom biome feel welcoming but too welcoming, even though its the most peaceful biome where monsters dont spawn at all- i feel like it would be helpful for lore, cause you could make it so that villages are never close to it because it seems creepy to the villagers, but for the pillagers they could know that the biome is peaceful and that theyre researching that biome  3. maybe you could make it seem like something happened to the western town   4. maybe you could make a swamp biome? or just a random swamp unless its too much work- and speaking of the swamp you could add a witch’s hut and upgrade that  5. the biomes could have nicknames! like for example the plains could be “the hub” since its the most common biome  these are just a few ideas i had and of course you dont have to use them! but so far the builds look amazing!! keep up the great work bud :]
You have social life?
The pillager outpost is a little to detailed but the other stuff is really cool
looks like land of wano
THIS IS AMAZING
Lego bionicle
Volcano!
I made a fully playable city escape game. Play time is about 3 hours but I put so much detail in the city with self challenges, Easter eggs and hundreds of hidden stuff, side games, treasure maps, this makes me jealous considering my city took me so long and I'm constantly updating it. It's fun to play, I've played it alot even tho I know where the key locations are.
Birch trees would make it pretty good aswell
This is soooooooo good you really went all out and I don’t know how even trolls could dislike this.
Add some new monsters
Can't wait to play this in RTX.
WHEN THE THUMBNAIL IS SUS!
S
This is more than amazing.
YEESSSS!!! I'm so excited for this series to continue! 💚💚💚
What about a woodland mansion?
this is insane. i love it.
Best Minecraft village I’ve ever seen 😁
where can a man like me find the world download?
THIS IS ONLY A REQUEST -hey trixy blox can you please give us this map download.
Is there going to be a mooshroom biome?
I LITERALLY SUBSCRIBED IMMEDIATELY AND LOOKED THROUGH ALL UR VIDEOS TO SEE IF THERE WERE MORE LIKE THIS SO HAPPY THERE WAS
Minecraft 5.123
GOD DAMN MAN
These are some suggestions I have: Making a few tropical islands and a volcano on one with super good loot in the core surrounded by lava
Why are you building a village
Minecraft medieval era
How about small little dungeons through out the map in like basement of abandoned houses or crypts
How do I get the map
Next
Anyone else saw how realistic the clouds look
Can you update the end city all you video on overwolrd so why not in the end right?
This is the best video I've seen in a while man, the charisma you have and the building techniques show alot. I can't wait to see where this series takes us!
How can you upgrade something already perfect?
I love
What about an assassin that hunts you down? Or a bounty hunter?
making me wish minecraft was an arpg
This is absolutely amazing!!! It looks soo cool and I can’t wait to play. What texture pack/ shaders did you use it looks extremely good
please let there be an uncharted 3 reference in the desert
this is the coolest thing i’ve ever seen, why isn’t minecraft like this normally
Tbh minecraft creators should see this and add it into the next update after caves and cliffs and maybe name it: next level
This boi worked day & night to build this i give this a infinity/10 for all that work
Well, dude, you've got a sub out of me.  I'm beyond impressed, I must say, and you've sparked the interest in World Painter as I am really into terraforming and biome creation. I can't wait to see the rest of your world take shape!!!
fallout refrences in mesa biome
looking amazing!
This looks so cool, and I'm hoping the download will be free. I appreciate your work so far! It looks so nice omgggg
HOLY COW, NICE JOB MATE
Npc's and quests?
I wanna download this world so bad
imagine this map with RLCraft
Minecraft TAKE NOTES
whens pt2 ?
project like this earned an instant like and subscribe from me. Amazing.
You should transform the dream smp
He asked for 80k, he got 670k. 100% deserved
Please make the sea temple into something  amazing!
Could you pls make me a survival map with a base in it? (Sorry for requesting even tho you have alot of projects, thanks in advance, but its okay if you dont)
your good in mcpe your like a legend i rate your build 10m/10
I can't wait to play on this :)
How can we play this?
I am awe-inspired by your skills and dedication. This might actually get me back into Minecraft again, who knows?
Oi
U should add a hidden snowman
If we play survival on it how are we going to get ores
I can’t even build a good starting house :()
Need Part 2!
80k ^^
Where should i douwnload this map
Where should i douwnload
I want this to be playable on Bedrock. Can you later upgrade this map to include the extension to Y: -64? Imagine what you could do with geodes and the new caves...
*"i am a good builde-"*  *why... why do i lie to myself?*
There's a weather mod that adds tornadoes and other storms, it destroys wood and dirt but leaves stone, it would make the map quite temporary but I think it would be cool to think that the island is slowly dying and you have to rush to get things done.
Vim pelo Jazz🤸🏻‍♀️
This could be a great Hunger Games map
This look like Wano Island in One Piece
HOW TO DOWNLOAD IT I  FEEL DUMB
Hey, what programs did you use for making this map so quickly? It’s amazing!
just WOW !
I’ve been waiting for something like this forever!! I would like to suggest a large mountain in the center as the snow biome, as I think that would be a cool overlook
When you’re done can you put it on the Minecraft market place so we can play it on bedrock
I swear if this Mojang does not hire this man by the end of the year I will literally cry
world download plz
can u make a big swamp and maybe showcase it with some modded mobs like gators? would look sick
I don't even play Minecraft but this is impressive.
Incredible
My question is will this map be for free or will it cost money because as much as I would love to give you money for all your hard work I just don't have it. I'm still in school and I can't get a job yet so I wouldn't be able to buy it but it looks so cool and I want to play it when its done!
It would be amazing if there was a story about why the pillagers are there maybe they are under rule of a corrupt king who usurped the island. Maybe you could also seek help for commands or plugins to add RPG elements
vim aqui pelo jazzghost
Better than watching movies 🤧🥳
Please make this for bedrock too. It sucks how a lot of awesome worlds are only accessible on Java.
Map:AMOGUS SUS
What about Warhammer 40k map? Like Emperor Palace ?
*Here is an idea*  With the western town base it a lot off the California gold rush towns, and of course old photos. With the abandoned village, make it in the heart. (or where the extremely lush and hard to get to)  With the Taiga the Appalachian mountain range , and maybe Yellowstone? With the jungle (tribes) maybe I guess Hawaii and it’s culture. And lastly mushroom. Do whatever I think you should use your creativity.
why does he have eyelashes only on one eye? Good video!
very talented worldbuilder
Do a part 2
A
This island looks like Onigashima from One Piece
Make a public server with this please
me dream: lets speed ruunn
Change the blocks on the side of the trees to wood instead of logs so then u can't see the inside where there is no bark
yo i know this must take a long time butttttttttt you could split it up into episodes because i am itching to watch the next video on this
Vim pelo jazzghost
Idea: sunken citty, uderground citty in the mountains ^^
Did he get 400000 subs in a week
Savage
This is huge
Your work is breathtaking and I will definitely play this map once you have finished it   You're amazing, dude 😁
I think a bit more than 80k…
658k:3.2k ratio
Amazing
Props to you (your girlfriend) for making this huge project by your own🙌
You should create a video as like a tutorial on how to use the tools and tricks you use to build your awesome builds
Me when he said survival: wonder how he will tackle upgrading the loot table and storage interior
You got over 80000 likes by like 600000 likes. Lol
Its moments like this that makes me want to spend crap tons on a gaming PC. I love the new map
His eyes look fake
bruh, you just earned a sub, this was amazing.
When will you think the map is done ?
Mojang needs to hire you
Dannnnnng
WHAT IS THIIIIS!!!!?
It would be cool to build the same libary as the one in the avatar last air bender where frow the outside it is only a tower but it is realy a big building that is under sand.
More than 60k likes gimme the link
Would I be able to download it on my Xbox one ?
I’m playing this with mods for sure!!
.
Omg your insane at building,
its only available on his Patreon and he makes it sound like he'll give the download link to the public, to get likes. kinda :/
wow, just wow.
I cannot express enough how much joy this brings me, this is a amazing!
I think there should be custom factions for each biome
I have a few questions first is this going to be on 1.16 or 1.17 also you said you were going to add a railroad is it going to go through only the the canyon or is it going to go through several biomes and also will this have any particular mods and texture packs in mind when making it
DOWNLOAD LINK! WE GOT TO 656K LIKES
him: they are vegetarians also him a couple seconds ago: they need another food source other then FISH (edit: yes i now get that he said pescatarians you can stop commenting on it)
You're almost to 1.5 mil.
THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!! 😎👌 NOICE!
i wish i had a pc to play this
what is the app he used to make this world called and where can I find it?
Tricky: hmmm I wanna build something in minecraft  Girlfriend: why don’t you build a house Trixy:I know I want to build an entire world   Me: BRUuUuUuUh
This is fucking insane i love it
May i suggest you make a Black Market,you can do it as u want but what if you make the main part of it underground of Plains and then do tunnels connecting to the other biomes
If only Minecraft was like this...
You should put a dragon in the map
Can this be played in bedrock? Because I don’t have Java :/
Imagine not liking this video
I can’t wait to put a gun mod on this
He literally made minecraft: breath of the wild
the first open world adventure map. thats crazu
im struggling being productive ar anything, usually amounting to watching yt, and this guy is building the whole universe. wow.
Dude this is so cool I wish Minecraft actually looked like this
What if the villagers in the snowy mountains were vikings
Ngl would be dope as a fortnite map.
This guy is really just making minecraft 2 by himself
Hi can you tell me how do you do that at 1:41
this youtuber sucks since i cant download this without paying and that is just stupid if people want this but cant pay
What about an custom underground dungon wich leads to the end portal
Not sure if you would want, but it would be cool to sell it on the Marketplace so that Bedrock players can see it too.
How do you copy and paste vanilla structures? Do you use commands?
I want the seed now
This hole time I’m like STOP SHOWING OFF!!!
He miscalculated little about 16,000,000 very little 😂
If I did this  :startes when I was 2 in 2021 :end when I am 1567 in 3023
makes an area that has bodies of dead iron golems as if a war had happened
this proyect its so good <3 But I just got a question...  what about the caves?
He looks like a mojang employee 😂😂
Clean your teeth
where is link to downoload?
You should try to make one of the builds from one of the Assassins creed games. One of the towers or cathedrals.
I think 80 thousand likes is not a difficult goal to make for him😂
Him asking for 80k likes meanwhile the video has 655k likes
Here is a meme i just made. (using the youtube comment only)  Minecraft: *exist*  TrixyBlox: This needs an *UPGRADE*
Could include an old battlefield from an ancient battle
The fact you spent so much time doing this shows you love for minecraft keep it up
You should build coresaunt
Wouldn't it be cool if he put a bow at the top of the church to resemble the soldier bow you get at the temple of time?
You should do a giant tree in the middle of the plains and make it like the one tree thing that is by the master sword in zelda
new Hypixel skyblock looks cool
Okay I love this???
Hide a UFO in the map!!
This video is awesome 100 fo 10
An egyptian style in the dessert would be nice. Like if you agree!
WANO KUNI?
What’s at the edge of the map?
I will be playing this and just glancing at the video has made me subscribe you didnt need to ask this is beautiful
Please add a tiger tank in the tiger forest
this looks sick this is what i want from mc hope you finish this
looks like wano country  One piece
Yeah, the trees look cool.  But they're gonna be hell trying to break it all down.
Omfg like actually you need to start working for Minecraft itself, the builders who build for minecraft currently are so bad, your on different bounds my guy keep it up
I haven't played Minecraft in a hot minute and before watching this video I wasn't subscribed to any Minecraft YouTubers. I am pretty excited for this and will probably get back into the game once you're finished. I don't know if you're still reading comments for ideas on what to include but I have some suggestions.  - An artificial island city far off the coast that looked like it was once a advanced Utopia but has since fallen into ruin and is now home to monsters - Multiple ruined Nether portals all over the map, all connected in the Nether by a transport system - move the mushroom island farther away from the mainland - a underground mountain settlement guarded by a lot of golems, with abandoned sections that are overrun with those bandits and monsters - a dungeon in the dark wood forest that is home to a witches coven - a hellish citidel in the Mesa that has Nether mobs guarding it - Norse themed ruins in the colder biomes
80k likes? More like 655k likes
It might be just be me but I want Mojang to have a advanced mode where they have theses crazy builds put in this advanced mode but what I want is to see is you lead these crazy builds along with the the other crazy Minecraft builders I am so happy to see that something that I enjoyed so much when younger that it becomes so much more then just dirt. I have to say that you have touched me with this and it makes me feel happy and I saw my childhood and friends before me but with a amazing man making it happy 1000 thanks to you mate
I wish he made a minecraft structure mod
Hello I’m a new subscriber!and I love your vids,your Builds are like Treasure to me!I would also like to build like that.but I can’t do that plus I don’t have that kind of Minecraft version.but you really impressed me when I first saw one of your vids.
Is the download only for patreon members
He says, "I have 1Million subs." Now, on May 26, he has 1.43 subs. Sooo... he basically got 430K subs in 1 week. If he waits for about 10 weeks, he'll get over 5M subs lol
Markus Persson needs to take some notes
The true record phongsaly attend because action notablely invite than a eight lentil. highfalutin, friendly print
You should deffo build s lighthouse
And how does mojang not hire this guy?
Can't wait to see more of this.  I have a idea for the ice biomie why not add a icy cave like you normally see no games like genshin impact's dragon spin caves. I don't really know what other games have that cool white and icy blue color in their caves.
I have never used Patreon before but I just might so I can get this map
your teeth look nasty asf
Take notes NOTCH NOW
Cool
Gg !
Used inversive railroad mod
Trixy: asks for 80k likes, gets 600k. Jardon: asks for 5 likes, gets 12k.  So... you're stronger, but at the same time, you aren't.  BTW, epic as usual <3

Uhmm... So yeah... I want A WHOLE DAMM LOT MORE OF THIS!!! DUDE! THIS is amazing!!! Can't wait to next video!!
BEAUTIFUL
how about Castlevania Castle as a Nether fortress?
this video is awesome!!! keep up the good work love and kisses - slxck xoxoxoxox
This ma deserves more subscribers and views
Mojang should really hire him to upgrade these structures in vanilla mc
HOW LONG DID THIS TAKE!!?!?!?!?!?!
Part 2
Ohh nice. Really can't wait to play this map when released. An idea would be for some secret rooms/labs to add some of that "Cult" group feeling.  Basically there's a few places where you can find a symbol. (The symbol would represent the End dimension, it's a temple that you need to find by following the clues)
This looks rlyyyy cool
Awesome build, really looking forward to the rest of it! A church always forms a cross, maybe you can improve it by reshaping it a bit to reflect reality a bit more :)
80,000 likes huh.  Looks like you crushed that.
I never watched any of your video but rn this is the one thing that peeks my interest.
Why does your right eye have no eyelashes
You just about reached your like goal
https://youtu.be/M5lUHk0UJGo
Underwater ice world
When you hit your next major milestone maybe you could do the Nether
What’s with your eye bruv
There is no water in the village, to drinking
This is literally too much
This is one of those video you wish was already 2 years old just so I can play
maybe you could make a dessert villiage with a mosque instead of a church or have a buddist temple at the snowy taiga villiage maybe have an underground villiage in the mesa canyon
You got me hyped for a game that I don't even play anymore, can't wait to see what will be done on this project
Can't wait for you to be done I also can't wait to play it
This world looks like Wano Country from One Piece...if it happened by accident, it makes the world EVEN COOLER
I really want a videos of youtuber playing this map lol
Maybe add a huge monster deep in the sea?
Will the pillager towers actually spawn pillagers?
Qm veio pelo jazz? :D
Mushroom biom has giant bones and dark magic dragons
Don’t forget the ores underground! (Especially the gold ores in the Canyon!)
bro please finish it so we can download the map, this map is fantastic
No one:  The clash of clans builder:
Imagine creating a Minecraft engine that generates all his builds as default. Like instead of normal boring oak trees you get these awesome much cooler ones, or instead of the boring normal village it generates the one in the video. Same with all other structures too like the pyramid, ocean temple, stronghold, etc...
Wow
castle
plz do a hogwarts map
This is cool
You don't even need to build yourself a base anymore you can just live in the village
Good 👍👍
You go about this one Swarm Byam
You should be a city planner
church tutorial when
Suggestion, u should make some of the villages a specific flag so the u will know  who owns what village. Mabey 2 of the biggest villages wanted to conquer a biome but ended failing and there is only remains of the structures, or even remains of wars between the villages.
This is pretty mind blowing...
Mojang Must See That
next part when
So Sick
Amazing! I wish i had this much building skill!
Absolutely AMAZING you are a great builder cant wait for the final outcome
Can i download this for mobile ???🖤
a horse stable in the village so players can get a better way to travel through the map since its so big

Why can't the ACTUAL paid Minecraft design team do this? put in more than the MINIMAL amount of effort? crazy how stupid dull the world is....tiny "trees" and shit villaes.
*”So I just did a little off-camera building”*
Maybe a abandoned pilidger outposts would be cool
So excited to download this!
Try to add Erebor 😁😂😅
with your "girlfriend" rrriiight!
Anyone else get a Skyrim feel from this build??? And got really hype?
minecraft in year 9999 be like:
Islam grohon koro valo hobe tmr
begging for likes within 2 minute, begging for subscribers within 3 minutes. fam this video better be good because this is not a good impression
What's your plan on 1.17/1.18? Will this be able to be played then? How might you incorporate their features in your map?
it would be really cool to have a custom nether too. I know it would be kinda hard , but it would be awesome.
Can I play this map in PS4?
Add cars?
Sounds like dungeons and dragons in Minecraft.^_________^｡◕‿◕｡
So good! You could build the best agartha bro👀
I need this seed .-.
make an giant castle  or fort in mountains from gme of thrones
Will you do anything with the mushroom village?
you play 29days to end it and build it soo long and cool(build)
If i walk outside and i look at the plains biome in that world can't see a difference. Flat.
Loved the breath of the wild references 💜
if villages looked that way in vanilla minecraft i wouldn't want to do anything bad there
This is fuckin cool. I would like to play with my friends
Wooow, how can i download it???
Make it available for bedrock players?
You should program it so monsters don’t burn in the sun you could also use command blocks so mobs need a lower light level to spawn
This could be perfect SBR map respecc man👍
sheeeeeeeeesh new subscriber
wouldn't it be pretty cool if the wild west town had a red dead reference in it?
Your building: impressive. MORE impressive: you showing restraint on the size of your buildings! :D

And cowboys
Your talent in building these structures are really cool I cant wait to see more
With it for trains
U should use mods
ooh, maybe add a replica of Nome, Alaska in the snowy biomes, and give it a mushing (sled-dog) theme!
You should and a world tree
Just a question, will you also upgrade the end & nether dimension when the player enters it, or will it just stay like the normal end & nether?
Minecraft must hire this guy
80k likes...
PLEASE MAKE A MOD!!
It was the 1 million special? Now you got 1,4 illion xD. Congrats!
in all your constructions you could put spawners so if you play the map do it a challenge
"Let's get 80,000 likes!" Within a week this video is at 675,000 likes.  This is amazing!
welcome to break your minecraft.com
u should work together with someone who can make datapacks for custom features (blocks, items, mobs etc)
that one guy in your smp:
I really hope this project comes with its own data pack or maybe a texture pack!
Damn the likes blew up last week it was only 20k but now its 648k
Upgrade the fishing system
Where can i download?
I think it took you a week to build this I mean like how!
can you make a part with the link in the description when you are done
He builts the same style i use everytime in survivel! But he ust just 1000x better than me in doing it 😂
This is awesome its absolutely amazing. You should totally create a breath of the wild-like story to this world.
I really like this proyect but i have some doubt with the proyect, it would naturally spawn pillagers in the pillagers outpost? And it would naturally spawn animales in the World? I supouse that It would have an end portal. And the nether ir would be a normal nether becayse if we create a portal really far in the nether, the World would break becayse it would generate a portal not in the Island. I love the projext and im really exited to play it but I really want that thisbdoubt would be answerd.
Amazing
A fun thing would be a sort of island nation in the ocean near the ocean temple or the plains.  Like some small fishing villages on some smaller islands connected by Bridges and boats with palm trees and sandy beaches.
👌👌👌👌
this kinda reminds me of the land of wano from one piece
Nice
I'd love to have the Rapture city from bioshock in the map
That looks amazing
Jesus it’s crazy how much talent people have in games when 10 years ago people didn’t even know what they were, man time does die
80k likes The gang 848k+ likes
I feel it would be awesome if this map had some mods with it like fire and ice so that it can have a sense of progression
Next video does the nether 😳
Ur pc has to be godly
I cant want until this is finished
An abandoned mecha
have the map to download?
I know you have talked about things that you really enjoy building of that aspect like GOT and Marvel, I was interested if you have ever played games like skyrim, very medieval and treacherous terrains, it would be very cool for you to slowly build the skyrim map as a series. I am a somewhat new builder on mc, I enjoy tackling big projects like you but I am not very skilled yet. I love your channel and it inspires some of my builds.
Imagine that this island becomes a server, and people starts building a massive city
when will we get the download link
holy shit this seems insane i feel like when it's done it will be as popular as Skyblock
I would love to see ruins of an ancient empire in there
THIS IS EPIC
Quem viu esse video por causa do jazz deixa o like
After you finish this project, you should build a fire kingdom
you should update stronghold and Villa in the woods?
Can you pls attach all video at once
Good job! Hope you will do something like that again!
You could maybe blend the edge of the dark wood forest into the plains with a small forest/river biome. And even blend the jungle into the plains with a small swamp. Or make a thin swamp as the transition line between the jungle and dark forest if you wanted to
Will we get a download link?
Croissant
Add ufo/alien
80,000 that seems to little
How do I download the world never done it before
No se de qué hablara pero se ve entretenido
vanilla minecraft in 2100 be like
And he said 80k likes I think we got that
GH0D !!!!, THIS IS JUST- SOOO BREATHTAKING. The Originality and the Creativity is Awesome :D   Me : *realizing the process on how LONG and how MUCH this PROJECT was developing.......*
You make me want to live at your Minecraft  world
i felt that in my heart <3
I’ve not played mine craft in a year but I will play it for this
Vim pelo jazz
The process of rtx:
Bro! This is insane!!! I really want play it, I mean, who wouldn't? But one thing, I do not have a PC, is it on xbox? Or is it java exclusive?
I absolutely want to visit the map by myself. Could you mix it in download please
this is good, im subscribing
When the build is finished, will it have the new update we are expecting to get later this year with all the new caves and ores and stuff?
that's just beautiful.
this is amazing, great job!!!!!
I want this in bedrock edition
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
Damn bro I really wish I could download this world, sadly though I’m on bedrock edition
I like how big brain this Guy is, he has stoled my subscribe because of that, but the fact that I can barelly build a home for me in minecraft makes me a little sad ngl :((
Making a floating island.
Someone needs to mod this and add new enemies and bosses
Your so good at building would I have to pay you to build on my realm?😆
You should be a part of hermit craft!
Why don't you just wear your glasses bro 🤨
I have not seen the video yet, but in the thumbnail I can see the inspiration you have with wano, in one piece. nice
This man are actually better than some game map designer out there
if i want to play in the world? ksajdfh
🤔 How about flying islands?
dude legit got almost HALF his subs in likes nike
Please tell us we can download this map when your done
A coyote a scorpion and road runner in the badlands, in the Arctic a penguin A snow Leopard and a yeti, in the jungle there should be tigers and parrots and pandas In the savanna biome there should be elephants rhinos hippos crocodiles and vultures and hyenas when any of the big animals die they have carcasses which attracts hyenas in vultures also lions.
I was gonna say put a hydron collider that creates a gigantic portal to the end. It would be a cool way to end the game
Add a floating island
A very big tree in the middle of the world plssss😂
You should do a Mansoin island
Wow dude, this looks like the best minecraft's map to play. Imagine playing this with your friends, imagine te experience that this could bring. wow
Gvie me world download link
i can't put it in words
PLS GIMME THE WORLD DOWNLADD
@TrixyBlox Bruva you honestly should open up your own Minecraft server. Would be awesome to see what you would do with it.
EPIIIIIIIIIIIIC
I really hope this isn’t limited to Patreon because I can’t afford it!
Why don’t they have builders like you for the official gammeeee
80.000 likes the man says🤣
Can you play this on ps4 i dont have a pc suitable for gaming
damn this is good
you can make an awsome survival  game
when the island is sus O_O
I think the end portal should be in a massive tower sticking out of the ocean in between the plains and the mushroom biome so the the end goal is looming over the main hub of the world. I think that the tower needs to be surrounded by mystical purple and green energy
I haven’t actually played Minecraft for a min. Now I wanna play just for the sake of this map.
I don't even play Minecraft, i don't even game more then one week a year o so, but this is just awesome and inspirational for all gamers and non gamers out there
6 days and he got 600k views damn
Try to make a ice burg or a ice creation in the mountains or a big ice tree for the yati
MOJANG should hire you to be the head for the next updates! Make them change all the silly vanilla generators.
Had to put a comment on one of the most epic Minecraft videos
i am so excited, its gonna be like playing a whole new game :)
Suggestion - make there be tracks connecting the villages between the biomes for the traders to cross
Will this be on just java or will it come out on some others?
Can you give the world
Be sure to also upgrade the mines!
What is the seed please please I beg you please awnser
Omg i didnt know i needed this make it
Redesign a Woodland Mansion!
wow great dude u got a sub wish i could build like that
Jeracraft be like:  "Finally a worthy opponent"
Where’s Wild West????
Please add a reference to harry potter in the mountains like the hogsmeade town or the castle of hogwarts
He sounds like me creating a new project in RPG Maker
Alternative title: Minecraft but it's actually Hytale
CANT WAIT TO PLAY THIS!! THIS IS REALLY AWESOME!
The build is very beautiful! I suggest building some sort of sauna in the snowy forest biome (or whatever its called) for a Finnish Forest Reference
Your constructions are incredible, unreal and amazing, I hope it can be downloaded or bought somewhere after that,
this is new level, this beautiful, creators of minecraft copy you for 3 years ahha
With the mesa idk if I spelled that right I suck at spelling bit anyways I think you should add some American Indian camps and hunting parties I think it would be really cool and add a nice little touch since it's a wild west themed area
Wow😱🤯
i cant download this on mcpe 😥
Wtfff he went up .08 millions subs in one day wow
Make sure there are normal trees and caves for playing actual survival too
The map will not be free guys but a few dollars. (Info from his discord)
I think it's great but 1 of my 4 braincells says it's bad bc it puts my builds to shame but it's 3 to 1 so it's good :)
A very long dungeon with lots of traps.
UFO crash site in the desert?
6:34 the flag takes away the realistic aspect clouds moving left the flag should be flying left to
im getting triggerd by his yellow theeth
You should make a really big ravine in like the jungle or something.
GOD DAMNNIT, HIRE THIS MAN ALREADY MINECRAFT! IM TIRED OF YOUR DUMB LOOKIN BUILDS
Wano kuni
1:29 SUS
Can U Make Any Country 😅
“If you want this world get me 80k likes” *gets 643k* Wtf congrats
Can u create Worlds like these for the Bedrock Edition? Awesome looking World!
Wait
yes
Just wow really 😱😱😱
Words cannot descibe what am feeling
i wish minecraft will eventually create a super realistic world type generator with giant trees and mountain peaks. just as an optional world type tho cuz the simple Minecraft map is what makes the game so great
Can you transform this to pe
Will this world be on the marketplace, or like a mod or something- I’m on mobile and I don’t know how to download mods ;-;
I would love it, if they would add this sort of trees in the basic game
Waiting for speedruns of this
Bro Your subscribers should increase more than PewDiePie or T series Cause This Is the best
New jeracraft confirmed?
Insanamente insano 😱
You could use this map for an online server in which each player has this same individual map for each one, and that the multiplayer meeting point with other players is the nether, thus having to repair the portal of the nether of the plains to access the multiplayer and obtain certain objects or whatever, is just an idea.
I cant wait for u to finish this project for the final results and so me and my friends can play on it. Don't forget to set the world spawn
Just wow. How long does the whole build take?
THIS IS SOOOOO SICK AND IT GIVES ME THE ULTIMATE SUBNAUTICA VIBES
My one recommendation is an upgraded cave system with enhanced versions of every naturally generated cave structure!
I think a lighthouse could be cool!
You could add an evil scientist laboratory? Maybe some villagers were trying to fuse pigs with zombies and it went horribly wrong.
you could integrate other projects in this world for example a castle you built
This is Minecraft!!!! İs it wrong? Ok          This is Sparta!!!! Or Minecraft...😐
Actually I want your world island map before transformation
kj
Where is swamp???
Can you trasform the end into the end castle
Build a plane that crashed that has starting loot for the player
This is Legendary bro🤭🤭🤭😵‍💫i love it a lot
can we just appriciate this man's effort on his videos he edit theese and even the maps are really huge you are making really good videos man hope you get better place :D
man, idk how you do it but im just speechless this is absolut amazing
Id love to see something similar to Winterhold/Windhelm/Dawnstar from Skyrim somewhere in the build
Herobrine
Wow, I can’t even imagine just how long these videos take you, so thank you so much for putting in the work because your videos are amazing!
Mojang should be taking notes

One day you'll grow up and see that minecraft is for little kids.
So umm this is just a suggestion but is it possible to make some floating islands or something builds within the world. And also some underground monuments like within cave systems or something
why isnt there farms for animals in the village?

On the cover I thought it was the kingdom of ooo XD
Can you play this map on bedrock?
How did you get the default structures? did you spend the time to put them all onto a flat terrain to save them in a file or...
How do I download it?
Wait isn’t it only 9 biomes?
I cant wait to play
We want the seed
What would be the size of this world 🤔🤔
you should make a big spot just full of the rocks you made at the start of the video but so much bigger
Will this be on Java
Try to do someting easy.
Can I get this on Tlancher?
Don’t forget to upgrade the Nether and the End
this is just a Bionicle Island
ITS BEEN SO LONG PART 2!!!!!
don't forget about the end!
This is sooo cool, ill defiantly  be trying it out!
Add under water caves with rare ores in it
Did there will be diamonds, iron, redstone   and more?
Thats best for a 2 day nonstop event battle royal survival
Yall love his worlds but I'm just lost in his eyes
BU HARITAYI ACCCCIL ISTIYORUMMMM
ohh this looks so good i really wanna play on this when it comes out
I whan to download this map
Ok cool idea. You should create a stronghold that is like the base of operations for pillagers. Then as a backstory. The pillagers are criminals who seek to conquer the world by force. Like a game of thrones style war but you know in minecraft
I WANTTT THIS MAPPPPPP
Wait a minute, your the guy who remade DanTDM's hardcore world aren't you? If so I love your builds
Castle or A BIG Wall like game of thrones
Mauy i know what shader that he used

nobody talking about how BIGB THE DESERT IS!! imagine being stuck in the middle of that, that would be horrible
It looks a lot like adventure times world, which is awesome!
Can I play this on minecraft bedrock
i love minecraft survival i might play this
This legit looks like an open world game like Legend of Zelda or Ghost of Tsushima, and that's really good
When I looked at the Thumbnail I thought you were making the Terraria Island LOL
I want the seed pls
Electronic Lincoln Logs
When can i download this map, please let me know
Its like two face in every directions
Amm there is 638k likes where is world downlod ?
I reckon you should make it so you have to explore to continue the original minecraft story. Maybe taking away the eye of ender crafting recipe so you have to find them in locations scattered around the map
imagine someone creates a mod that matches with this map, that would be incredible
Wow 0_0
Link del mapa?
how to download the map ?
Keeeeeeen
dude wanted 80k likes and now have 600k+!😳 can't wait for this!
One like for hardwork
It looks like the ooo island in adventure time
is it available for download for the map with nothing built ??
you can remove the mashroom biom and add there a dark scary nether temple, you can add there a boss like wither or ender dragon and you cant go there without nether star or finish the game
AMOGUS SUS
This is jaw dropping, I bet every minecraft player would LOVE to play this map. It will be a good idea to make a minecraft server using this map.  If it is possible to customize the nether world as well, it would b EPIC.  Love the effort
this is insane. I cant wait to play this
Wow :0
Love it
Can we download map to our Minecraft?
this is so cool! I'll definitely want to play it when it's done. here are some questions and suggestions i thought of!  will you try to incorporate the new Caves update into this? it would be awesome to be able to play this world with magnificent caves, although transforming them all would be a lot of work.   and also a swamp biome would be nice for survival, as witch huts are useful for redstone farms :D  and will the nether and end be changed at all? <3
bruh its the fortnite island
Yeaaaaaa!!!!
This is beautiful
Only if mojang was this talented 👁️👄👁️
In the time before time,
I haven't played minecraft since 1.6.4 but i am willing to pick it up again for this map. What did I miss?
i can only say this: omg, you're crazy bro!
How you Made these camera tour?
This build looks epic, I hope he can. Bring in some of his other builds into the island like the underground kingdom.
How to be you?
I would like to find underground lakes and rivers. Some of them overgrow others filled with spiders and cobwebs.
We need to upgrade Crafting system
Behold my new castle! *Hear spiders*
Mojang will hire you for updates bc your so good at designing things
Can my phone handle this? If i download the world  can i play it in minecraft pe?
Incredible!
i think you should upgrade end and nether tho if ppls gonna play this map
Is der a kraken pls
Someone needs to make a mod that replaces generating vanilla structures with yours
a Pillager Castle                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      E EE EEE EEEE EEEEE                                                                       Its cool

1:52  Ahh my Eyes
Maybe u could work with a modder to make bosses or something epic :)

I would suggest to make the mushroom island a bit lower in elevation, than shown in the video.
Man, I really hope you do a custom nether too. This shit is fucking insane!
0:17 illuminati confirmed
Bisal

This is incredible. Can't wait to play on this map.
The pillager outpost looks so cool  And if you overtake it, itll be a good base
Will this map be free tho?
the thumbnail is so sus that it killed all of my braincells at once, truly sus.
Him: just changing small details to the library: the frickin end product: am i well myself? It seems my body elvolved to my requiem form. Library requiem!

Can you make a mod that upgrades the naturally generating structures  to these ? Plz ive been short on video ideas so id be a very good series. Also im in bedrock so plz fo that format too.
im speechless
Here’s an idea for a backstory for the cleric  So they where basically outcasted for using “magic” (cause the brewing. Stand Is potions) so they travel the world selling goods and services to do little magic tricks etc?
Goodness Gracious this is insane
instead of the normal pyramid try adding ur epic black stone pyramid pleaseeee
Should of waiting a little and built this on the giant caves 1.17 update
That would be so crazy if minecraft was like this you should work with mojang
Where is LINK.....       (lol, im joking bro 😂)

*80k likes he said, surely there is still a long way to go if this was uploaded 6 days ag-*  634 THOUSAND LIKES?!?!?!?!  PS, Deserves so many more
i'm so exited
when will the map be released
You should put your desert temple pyramid into this world and convert the gold into quartz so its not broken. It would also add a bit of lore because it would show that the ancient civilization that built the pyramid retrieved the resources from the nether.
Build hidden village and give them a power like naruto example village hidden in the mist 🍥
This might sound rude but are you missing your eyelashes on your right side or it just the lighting? Also very cool world, keep it up!
how to play this?
Please give US a mod that put so great structures automaticly in MC
I am waiting for this to complete
You just earned a subscriber. I'm soooo downloading this and playing it.  .Please when will you be done? I can't wait!!!!😭😭😭
Make the ghost of Tsushima map please
Are you able to put a seed for the map for people to play or something idk I don't play minecraft that much but that would be cool.
Make a scp foundation in the snow mountain plz!!
Wow pretty impressive
WERE TO DOWNLOAD THIS WORLD
You need 80 thousand likes But  634k 🙂

Why can't Mojang do this in vanilla Minecraft?
I'm very curious as to how he did the recordings and can't wait to play this map.
EPICCC
what program ďid you use to make biomes?
Will this be able to be played in mcbe?      If not *sad noises*
Can u make a religion to the villager or the pillager so it looks more like a real survival world
can you add a oak and birch forest on the edge of the plains biome
Instantly pressed the subscribe button after seeing this. (Eventhough I don't play minecraft because pc issues). I would like to see more of this! :)
It would be cool if you went with a sort of medieval theme in the dark oak forest.
Im amazed and insipred how much u spend in tine and caculating and ur  builfing skills is amazing ur a very great inspiration :D 😀
Limenade Outro Music
are you sure you want 80k likes? :)
In the the spruce forest add a dark cave that leads to a giant circular nether portal with vines hanging from it and pillars of stone

In the ocean add a monster
How many century does it taken to do 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Suggestion.  This is only partway through this video, but...  Definitely giant trees with villages in them! Edit:  Additional.  And a giant mushroom house on the mushroom island.
Suggestion: please make a synagogue as one of the places of worship!
Idk why does this give me skyrim vibes
How much time did this dude spend transforming this world
OMFG this looks there best out of all games I have seen.

Thanks you have bind helping me whit building good and i will give you the best luck in the world  --------------------------------------------------------- Im trying to do the thing you are doing right now like building a big survival word IM WILLY THANKFUL FOR YOUR HELP
Imagine playing that server😯
On how good the trees look, I feel like I wont even get them for wood! Thats how the trees are well made! Srsly you did a very good job.
The nostalgia that i got when i read the thumbnail was inevitable...
It kinda looks like an among us
I haven't played minecraft in almost a decade, but I might just come back to play this map. Looks amazing
How to download this map?
please finish it, ı am Hyped to play
Deserves a like and sub button
The best project of yours
Add something in water
YOU ARE CRAZY
well this just reminds  me of how useless and untalented i am
Bro I have an idea. And if you create a "mod" where changes the type of world structures to the upgraded structure like yours? Idk how, but i think that's a good idea
Suggestion: You mentioned some mines, so I was thinking you can make underground tunnels connecting important locations, with alternative paths that can lead to dead ends or "boss fights". An underground maze with journals telling you the right direction. Maybe have the messages encrypted in some way, while the way to read the message is hidden in another journal in the pillage outpost or the miner's house from the village.
Where ur eyelashes go?
Will this be playable on the pe version of minecraft
Do you have any tips for building?
Imagine if you can find this structures in vanilla..
Wow! I cant wait to play the map.
Make a giant epic sword in the middle pls?
Imagine creating this in Survival
wow...I'm speechless great job man
Okay Minecraft has to hire this guy like THEY NEED TO this guy is the most Detailed Builder
Mojang should hire you :D
WE NEED Forgelabs to have a 100 days survival hardcore on your map! It’s a win win
Ummmm I'm waiting for part 2.............
Looks like an anime isekai world
Satisfying
I’m not sure if my iPad can survive this XD
I can't wait to play this. Looks absolutely epic.
You should make as guard from Thor
You could also add a volcano
Wow soo cool ey can you build konoha from naruto
Everyone will play minecraft if these *upgrade* structures and more are created in 1.18
I would never make this.. I wanna copy the plain village so my maps look nicer XD
This is so pogg
Whats name builder Minecraft
This is Ultimate Remastered version of MineCraft
This would obviously unnecessary work, but it would be really cool to have a very exposed cave/ravine to maybe lead to a small underground ruined city / abandoned outpost settlement. Could add to the lore, and maybe be a secret. I totally love the look of this project, and will happily wait a long time to see the passion go into this. Amazing. *edit* -Also forgot to mention Gratz on 1 mil, you're going to be taking off even more because of the attention to this project and compounding views!

I’m picturing a modpack that just replaces all structures, plants, biomes, etcetera, with your various builds. I could see Minecraft being far more interesting if filled with your upgraded versions of vanilla stuff
Subbed! I can’t wait to see this project play out
Bild rest af the mape 80,000 to bild rastaf the mape ju got 600,000
This is amazing. You should add a cool waterfall or a volcano. I love your videos!
One word beautiful

Mojang watching this be like:                                 👁👄👁
where's the maaaap
asks 80000 likes, now about to get 1M likes, legend
Me after seeing this: Whaa :0
DUDE we should move the underground elvish cave to this world and create a secret pathway to it fuckckccccc that would be so cool
make the world as server it will be legendery
you should transform the underground aswell like making the caves ,abandoned mines and the ender ruins.
ok we should make a whole rpg world with the finished map
You need to work on minecraft!!!!
I hope this is done soon so i can download it😁
How has Mojang not hired you yet. This map would be such a cool addition to the game.
Please tell me what I need to do to go into that world
@TrixyBlox how can we download this i mean who the hell will not want to play in this world
It just wanna know how to get it when ur finished with it
How many times did he say feature? My guess 16
3k people who disliked 🚮🚮🚮
Mind blowing im already excited to play on that world u just made Minecraft amazing again
Im down for this
does anyone know he only has eyelashes on one eye?
Will it work in mcpe
Definitely looking forward to you making a ultimate build combining all your builds including this, the pyramid, underground/underwater kingdoms, medieval kingdom, Aztecs etc... and give it a really good story line (I'm willing to help with that).
This is what minecraft needs. Suprised I had only found your channel today. Creativity at its finest. Salute to you sir! Can't wait for the finished map.
It would be very awsome if he paste world tree in the middle of plains like in valheim but its very big and makes the game laggy
I need that give me the seeds
I Wish You Put Some Other Stuff In Neither🤫
Wow this is sooo epic!
Can I get seed of this
Dude what if this would be released for free?
Epic
Why Dark Wood? ??????
Make a spaceship reck in the mesa biome
Me: just watches this  Nobody:  Me:*subscribes* Nobody: Me: *searching for the rest*

THIS IS INSANE!!
Cant wait to play it!

AQUI LA COMUNIDAD HISPANA DISPUESTA A TODO
You need support: -I like those pillager outposts walls so heavy, they are perfectly decorated. -Church is fitting in the village -Portals 2 cracked buttress are so so so so so so so nice
You are awesome man
upgrade the nether while you are at it!
I'm going to start a gofund me so you can go get your teeth clean.. I can tell you have horrible breath.
Pls upload pt.2 as soon as possible
Mojang wants to know your location
Epic..❤️ Slap like Now!
Suggestion: A magical forest with a huge hidden tree with a house inside, underground kingdom,  a castle very high up in the sky, a wandering house, knights, flying islands in the jungles, a island in the water what’s actually a colossal animal, a city that’s inspired by China and Japan, an underwater world, a lake in the dark forest where the dead souls go, fortresses in the upper world and nether, a European themed mansion whose owned by an young master, ruins, dungeons, a place with hundreds of clocks and each clock is the lifespan of each person and the ground is also a clock and u can fall in the ground,  caves with hidden chests and monsters, a fantasy steampunk house, a small village on the water, a wisteria forest on the mountains with a place to meditate (u have to take the stairs to go to the wisteria forest), statues of gods and hero’s and whatever idk I’m not very creative, aesthetic places, mermaids, and elf kingdom with super small elf’s, a railroad around 17 Blocks in the Sky what leads in a cave with a massive magical underground village what gives u wizard vibes and some old fashioned restaurants(western themed and Chinese themed). Sorry for my bad English I really did my best writing this
Reminds me a lot of my Skyrim playthrough, keep up the great work! (I'm looking forward to it)
Maybe something with a dragon tho I doubt u will see this comment
what's the name of this program to do the map?
2x if you're lazy, not recommended tho
Live the map! It'd be really cool I'd you added some custom caves and underground areas to make mining a bit more interesting.
this is minecraft in 10years
I really hope when it’s done it will be for everybody and not only his patrons but if it was only for patreon I would understand.
how can i download this map ??
"NoicE"              -Banana
Sir please give me this beautiful world's seed please I want to play
Playing Minecraft but better
Plsss i want to save this:(
Kinda looks like map of Tamriel lol
I swear more and more people will play this if the decorations are like that-
Every 1 mil Minecraft youtuber is always Awesome and British lol
629k likes. I can’t wait to play this when it’s done
Can I download this world in bedrock edition or pocket edition
What I download this map in mobile phone????
I think you just forgot woodland mansion
its at 600k+ likes and you havent uploaded the second video so excited just waiting!!
This idea feels like it drew inspiration from The Constant in Don't Starve.
Can not wait to play this. Its gonna be epic...
This map looks awfully similar to Northrend from WoW
kore wa isekai dah
Suggestion: you should also alter the Nether spawn that the ruined portal leads to
Ngl this feels like some sort of 3d Don't Starve map
I fully intend to play this! But will it be a huge file?
I love this.The default plans is to booooooring!I also completed breath of the wild 2 times. Please do the masa biome next.Keep on building!
Wouldnt it be possible to make a trixy modded launcher together with a modder where worlds would auto generate with all of the upgrades structures?
How would I be able to play this map with modded structures? Like with ice and fire, how would I get dragon nests to spawn on the map? Im asking this if it is possible.
Upgrade the nether too
you should add some to increase exploration and more ores
Almost there
Your upgrades are so cool
Can you do all your biggest projects in this map
Hey Trixxxx, do a dungeon sized underground lab in a snow biome, that could be so cool
*does 1 mill sub special youtube: have some more
Jeez bro at this point u focusing to much on MC😂😂
Ihope i can download this in Bedrock edition🥺🥺
You should reference the original tri-and quad- mountain survival maps in a library or something!
Whoa
HOW LONG DID THIS TAKE!?
Will there be custom villagers?
I hope a LOAD of youtubers take your map and make it a huge series, to hunt the secrets, fights between biomes, it has SO MUCH POTENTIAL!!!
this would be amazing as a rlcraft map
i remember watching you awhile ago, idl why i stopped... but looks like your doing good
How can one download it?
Omfg u are so good Bro........!
Omg this would be a perfect map for a wasteland RP
I am fully invested
Wow that's awesome, can you makes that to be a hardcore mode?
Awesome work! Can't even imagine how hard it was to build. My like and subscription!
Dude!!! I wish I had the pure talent to do what you do! How long in total do you think this project is going to take? (Not talking about video to video, I mean how many hours have you put into doing this INSANE project?)
Can't wait for the next one.
Why can’t Minecraft worlds look like this?
Me over here still building dirt houses 😃
That is incredible. Wow
BRO MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS LEGEND OF ZELDA BREATH OF THE WILD BUT MINECRAFT AND U EVEN MENTION IT IM SO CRY
Like a pubg battleground map😄😄😄
Mans, got up and say I’m going to make my own Skyrim in Minecraft
I wanna play on this map
Maybe ask someone who is good at command and ask if they can somehow make the Cleric Waggons move around the map and head to another village Imagine going around the desert or snow biome and see a waggons moving in the distance that would be cool But then again maybe this map is a no command map so...
Is noone gonna talk about the map is shape  like the MILLENNIUM FALCON!?
This is giving me lord of the rings vibe. Idk why
They say minecraft is for kids, bruh this game competes in other esport titles out there not in terms of esport itself, but the dedication and hard work put onto this is, what makes it not just a kids game.
W o w   n o   w o r d s
How to download this map
I can’t wait till this is out
OMY GOSH he is so talented goshh😶
It blows my mind that people still think this is a kids game
I know this comment will likley drown in a sea of others but it would be really cool if you made a nether build on the nether side of the ruined portal. So if someone fills it in they have a whole new build area to explore.
you should add references to the YouTuber base recreations you did
Can you add konoha that would be great
Wano?🤔
Would this be on bedrock or no? If it’s a no I’m pretty sure people can transfer Java worlds to bedrock
He plays 25 hours a day
Uhmm hello I hope you notice this cuz I have a suggestion i hope you'd like it. My suggestion is about making a movie or a giant mc map called "Journey to the Wonders of the World" with all you're maps or builds like the upgraded jungle temple or the upgraded desert temple amd also this what do you think? I hope you do notice this.
this is absolutely BEAUTIFUL
You should really watch Shadiversity’s video on castle design and castle interiors, I’m sure it will make your castle building improve a bit.
DO A FAIRY VILLAGE BUT MORE DETAILED😭😭😭😭
Add a secret vault with some valuables somewhere in the map
Hopefully this is uploaded weekly and not monthly
Is it ok if when this is downloadable I can make a survival series on it?
The saddest thing is that I will never be able to make that because I don’t have any talent, I’m just dumb and useless
i love this so much
Trixy can you make like a giant futuristic city in the middle of the plans that be pretty cool like a city from Tron the movie
cannot download world?
@TrixyBlox, can you provide a link to the map when you are finished? I would LOVE to play it.
I would actually love to see a little guardian that’s rusted and decayed in the plains biome to give a nod to the inspiration   Edit: the windmill really reminds me of Hateno and the building in general and I love the look of it
In the night there will be more zombie apocalypse (＠_＠;)
the island is sus
pls gimme this fast
I CANT WAIT TILL IT'S OUT!!!!
Can you please re-create my Minecraft base to look nice please because it looks very bad
wooww
Looks like u copied wano in one piece anime🤣✌️
Trixblox please read this massage i want you to build a prison with alot of redstone please than convert it to bedrock for us to download it
I wonder if this is going to be available on Minecraft Pocket Edition. Is it gonna be downloadable for MCPE?
It’s all fun and games until your computer explodes
ur eyes are creepy
what is the seed of this world
When can we play it
This is awesome If this becomes a series *We will watch your career with great interest*
dis do be lookin like a new fortnite map
Add a satan village👹👹👹
"80,000 likes" okay well a week later you're at over 600,000. 😂
Maybe add primal creatures in the winter biomes, like; mammoths, sabertooth tigers etc. Or you can add a tomb in a desert with a mummy boss that drops alot of loot,  You could add a jungle with multiple animals; monkeys, parrots, tigers and maybe a secret hut etc
OMG i Cannot Wait
it’s literally too good and i love it
Well I wanna play it but my computer will fucking die. 16,000,000 blocks! That shit is crazy!
Oh wow.  This is impressive...!
Bro Mojang has got to use or at least take inspiration from his 1st pillager outpost, that would be like a mini boss u have to fight
Ok let’s be real here who also thought the thumbnail had a Minecraft fortnite map
Can i download that map😅
This channel grow super fast because of 1 video 🤣. love it
This man should work with Mojang
U should please make the snow biome like Nordic style
I feel like you should add a wall to the village since zombies are gonna kill off all the villagers within a night
You should make a mcpe copy once you finnish
I kinda like to see a tropical pirate Bay on the outskirts of the jungle
He basically made Hytale :D before the real one comes out
I really wanna see Trixy collab with Grian, 2 builder gods in a world.
brush them teeth
This is fucking beautiful
Just amazing I don’t even know what to say this was just one video on one biome this is absolutely amazing
this is gonna be so cool to play when its done, its java right?
God fucking damn it this is breath taking...
HUSK VILLAGE
Looks like hyperboria
Can we get more caves
Just started watching your videos and now I can tell I’m never gonna stop
The thumbnail looks sus
What would the world look like if you combined multiple biomes together? For example combining the mesa, desert, and Savannah biomes.   The mesa would be the outskirts of the area with steep and unforgiving cliffs where a misstep could cause your demise. it would have abandoned mines/town full of bandits scattered across the land.  The desert would be the middle ground of the area only accessible by fighting through a bandit controlled stronghold that controls the only practical way to enter the desert, unless you're willing to scale the steep cliffs of the plateau or brave the old mines hoping to find one that exits into the desert. It would have small oaisis with trading towns surrounding them.  The Savannah will be the final area and is home to one of the major kingdoms, because of this fact bandit camps are rare and less populated. The kingdom would be built in and around a crater where a "unending" water flows into.
you is very pro
Uau!
I would like to see a castle or fortress of sorts in the tiga biome
U are the most epic and legendary builder that i ever see
Are you making a part 2
well i was thingking of  an abonedone or whatever it spell shooting range full op bows☀︎︎,
Ok on first sight I readily decided to play, But... Afterwards realised that my pc can't handle this 😅😞
this looks awesome. you should continue it.
This guy should work for mojang
Gg
Put some pillaged base yoooo
People: Minecraft Skyrim does not exist Internet: *Minecraft Skyrim*
Will you pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeee make a download file for BEDROCK or MCPE version of minecraft. I LOVE this already😍😍😍😍
80,000 hah please! We got more than 620k!
That map size is so big to travel from one side to the other in survival would be insane
Simply put I want to ✨live✨ there
this is a freakin epic project
Make it look as if some two opposing forces sre at war somewhere It would be fun
Trixy: make sure you get this video to 80k likes (six days and 625k likes later)
will there be a world download?
I love this so much.  It’s such a cool idea, and given that you are one of the most talented builders I’ve ever seen, I can’t wait for more transformations!!!    It would be so cool if there was just one giant cave system under the whole map with one huuuuge cave room that had crystals or smthn in it.
Should've have added fences and slabs to the trees... they look good but don't make sense for survival game play. It would still look good without them so it's just weird
You are amazing. This shit will be played by a lot of people bud. Keep it with this Minecraft rework.
I feel like you could add the USS Bonhomme Richard with John Paul Jones Diary that says where some buried treasure is some where around the map
This is like Minecraft MMORPG Survival
New Fortnite map poggers
Make that Bob Ross reference.
i feel like u should add a story like quests or if it where multiplayer probaly like guild? just my idea (games and anime thought me off that guild idea lol)
I have an idea! How about a religion surrounding a giant skull that’s inside their land? Maybe they think it’s a remnant skull from an old battle and they worship who they think killed it?
pure talent 😁🤘
you should do a collab with grian lol
I Feel like The mushroom Island shouldn't be so clsoe to the edge of the island, Like it would be visible, but way further away-
I can just visulize the DreamSMP taking over this map
cool to see people are still doing cool stuff w this game after so many years.
I can't wait to live in Wind mill
so... download?
Like a wanokuni place 👍🏻
you are talented good job bro❤🖤
Op
Kinda reminds me of the hungergames clock arena in a way, I dig it
When will we be able to download the world
Woah. I just subscribed this is sick it’s so awesome
This remind me of skyrim
Would it be downloadable for minecraft pocket edition?
i love how he takes something so small and basic and completely transforms it into a monumental structure.
insanity
This is literally stunning. Great job!
Map looks like a settlers of Catan board.
Não sei ler sua língua aínda
That is some hardwork....Mind sharing some of your patience😅😅
Question: How are you going to maintain the consistency of survival gameplay? Since the world is all hand built, how will you handle caves and all sorts of recourse gathering?
This is not a clickbait. I'm literally speechless. So much content
Attempting to do max render distance on this map would result in your PC flying off due to how fast the fans would be spinning
I this video your are amazing I just subscribe just this alone is amazing I really hope you add this to bedrock version,I have been waiting for this for a very long time but Minecraft never add it.Really though this is amazing,hope you see my comment.
With the wild west maybe make a civil war fort with working canons and it maybe can be under siege by  pillagers
Sir I am still waiting-
you are extremely good at buliding and this is incredible. i look forward to playing this when u finish
Croissant
Looks incredible
this is amazing! Can you create a guard house in the village and fill it with a stone golem comander and training dummies?
•
Vim pelo JazzGhost.
Labyrinth.
this is just AMAZING  it looks awesome ngl The remake on the world is really cool
Can you turn a villager town into a city?
Take a sub
TRANSFORM THE WOODLAND MANTION
Westworld
Can i download this map??
I LOVE THIS 😲🤩
I can’t wait to play this
This man NEEDS Hytale! If he's this good working under the limitations of Minecraft, his Hytale builds will be mind blowing!
I don't understand why vanilla doesn't look like that. Would make the experience so much better
It's nice to see someone else with a creative imagination but I don't understand how you spend so much time building these your using world builder yet it supposably takes you 200 or more hours to build stuff is that Minecraft hours cause real life hours it shouldn't take that long unless your counting hours you rest or sleep though I don't feel those hours should count. I've built massive builds covering a whole Minecraft map like a massive castle with underground volcano caves beneath it tree's along side the mountains with pathways so you can walk anywhere and water falls and alot of other cool stuff and it only takes 4 to  5 days keep in mind there's only 24 hours in a day. I haven't met anyone who has been able to build stuff like I can from scratch actually mining blocks and placing them. Yeah you have awesome builds I won't deny that I even like them and want to play them but there's people out there who don't have to use stuff like world builder to create a masterpiece build something like what your used to building but without world builder and then you can truly say you accomplished something it's kinda weird seeing post about how your a god at building and other stuff when in all reality your not putting much effort in what your actually building I mean click here,click there, you can delete alot of blocks at once or put multiple down you only have to put part of something then copy and boom complete pattern. If you can do what you've been doing but in an actual Minecraft server using a pickaxe then I can accept it when someone calls you a god at building.
I think you got a little over 80k
Wish i could have this map on the ps4 but without the builds so we could add our own
this map would do really good with a zombie mod
Best of build I could see in my life. No other builds can be better then these... NOTHING!!!
Boyyyy you gotta put ruins everywhere.
I hope one day I could get it be a good builder
Boy brush yo teeth
Amazing! I think it’d be cool to see a cliffside woodland mansion, but redone to match the world, but idk that’s just me.
Ah I dont know how to download the map ):
I- i am not worthy to be watching this- im a peasant compared to you-- omg.. great work keep it going!!
Are you going to make one video for one biome
Find someone to make this into a world generation mod
Make it a free map we can play
I really want to see the other biomes aaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!!
I also wish this could be on console 😩
Wow, TrixyBlox. You did ASTONISHING on all of these builds, great work!
Say there was a war
I think you should also make a end dungeon as well to make the game bearable. Also maybe add new mobs like the new mobs that are gonna be in 1.17!
Can you do a 100 days in the map when your done please this is amazing work with your dedication
Can't wait to see the other parts
Will this map be released?
Mojang needs to hire you they would make way more money if you made maps for them seriously they need to hire you to make maps/worlds to sell and to emerse them to play more in so hyped to play this
Add bikini bottom
Wish it would be available for console players
For the secrets if you don't somehow add back to the future to the old wild west part thats just not right
Did you add in the ores underground?
Here are the names for these areas ready for you to use  Cobblewood Plateau (Plains) Glacierpeak Tundra (Snowy mountains) Olde Baren Frontier (Mesa) Mushroom Marsh Island (Mushroom Island) Moonlight Nightsylvania (Dark wood forest) Taigawood Treetops (Taiga) Sand Dry Wastelands (Desert) Sunlight Wilderness (Savanah) Deep Urban Ruins (Jungle)  These are also for in case you want to include them in the future.  Crimson Valley (Nether) Oblivion Abyss (End) Undersea Depths (Ocean) Crystal Ore Casam (Caves)  Bonus Acropolis Haven (Aether) Luminous Realm (Twilight forest)
can we get some caves😏🤚
suggestion: you can do some sort of underground city or, a small cave leading to an underground city. where its a whole civilization. maybe that can be a part of some sort of treasure map guide.
Woooooooooooow
A cave in the deep areas in the snowy mountains, with dead bodies, skulls, Blood, (red stone) Cages on the roof, Chains, and a boss mob
This is awesome but you did a little to much
city
where do you release your map's
Nice Man 😎👌
He needs to go onto fivver and build worlds for people
This is just breathtaking
Where do I download this there are 622,797 likes and I want to play this world : O
cant wait for it to be finished
Suggestions: 1. Elves village 2. Adventure guild 3. Wave; a periodic monster swarm
you should make the Castle from resident evil 8 I think it will be a challenge for you so I think you will like it, unless your not up for the challenge.
you have taught me how to build so well in this game I just want to say thank you for everything and I really want to see the wild west village
I think this idea is great although the plains biome could use another village and more pillager outposts
The slow resolution increasingly pump because couch booly store absent a breakable kettledrum. high-pitched, six traffic
The upbeat hot ultrastructurally tap because stone distinctively colour athwart a exciting exclusive propane. animated, adjoining surfboard
for the finally you should build a nether hub where the  ruin portal pops you out that places you inside a Piglin Village or Castle and do you plan on putting a End portal in? and if so could you also make a custom End Island more fitting for the final battle?
Can you add a boss in each biome
why are there dislikes on the video its an amazingly talented guy building insane builds minecraft makes no sence
Now this is epic
TrixBlox: build three sections for farms, carrots, potatoes, and carrots. Beetroot: sniffs
He really make all minecraft player's dreams come true
You should add a stable to the village
I’ve got an Idea in the snow or ice biome or maybe the snow mountains you should have a frozen dragon or creature below inside with a snow city on-top of the area that knows about the frozen creature below them and heck even a abandoned frozen city that worshiped the creature
Can't wait to play this
Dude when you finish can give us the seed of this because i can't wait to play in this 😆
Im just waiting for the next part
i looked at this and thought "wait why is vivosaur island in minecraft", only cool people would get this
Yooo this is sick, I really want to get my hands on this map. I haven't played Minecraft in years, but this is making me want to go back.
Do you think mabye you can make abandoned houses with loot around the map?
It would be cool with a “face rock” feature among the boulders
The pillagers thank you
The tan basketball presently admire because computer radiographically plan till a utter eggnog. needless, sweltering behavior
How can I download this map?
him: its going to be vanilla  The Vanilla:
Please tell us when you finish it I must try this MUST TRY THIS
Try making a mod of this i would really enjoy it!
Java? Or not
80.000 Likes?
you can probably put castles in different biomes or at least like a place with the king in it like the pyramid as example its still like what the ruler would be in
Amazing! You're an inspiration for me to build more structures and make my Minecraft more fun and immersive. I hope i could play this new map you build
Will this be a downloadable world when finished?
**Gta 6**
4 the Anmiils
How bout about A better farm
All we need now is the Jurassic Mod.
You might be the best Minecraft YouTube on the platform my guy
Suggestion: there should be a secret old shack deep in one of the forest
Can you make this avalible in Minecraft .edu editon
You should upgrade the neither
might get me back into MC  the pillager outpost is like a Mongol Camp from Ghost of Tsushima
How does one get this map?
Wish I could play in on bedrock
You should also add under ground cities and add a underwater city like bioshock
fcking amazing
Should get someone to do the "quest" type things you talked about to lighten the burden
cant wait to see it
Amazing work!!!
On the snow biome you should add a huge frozen castle
Absolutely incredible. I so appreciate with you because It's need so much energy to make this.
WOW!
what if there were giant worms in the center island, that can jump out as someone tries to scale it... "knocking a player back, similar effect that some npc's have that don't necessarily need direct contact to work (then there is a enchanted hat or something)". :)
Epic :)
Damn it's just straight up RDR2 Minecraft
Is this Australia
Goddamnit... Here! Have a 'Like', another subscription and a bell thing! You deserve it! Well done!
I like that map thoe lol
whoa
Wow, i'm amazed by your skill and creativity, i would like to know how to build such details, even if i'm a rookie at building, a no-one I may say compared to you, Grian and Gera, you're amazing
There should be a huge chain attached to the mushroom island so it’s like attached and to get to the mushroom island you should have to climb in the chain and walk on it
Just a minor qualm, the carriage looks way too big for those two horses to realistically pull. But regardless, everything looks great!
Can I have a free copy of this world please? I really love the work you put into this video and world and I wanna start a survivle-ish series on it, and ill be sure to leave the link to you're YouTube channel ^^
Where will we be able to download the map
Come on if they're is not a secret kraken quest, then im goning to FLIP!
Floating islands biome?
Bruh, I wanna play this so bad but I only got Bedrock Edition
Its awesome. I am soooooo gonna play this when its done.
I might actually try to make a server on this world once your drop the download, pretty sure my friends and I would probably level the place.
Dude this is awesome!
Bro i honestly wish i could build like this but im not nearly skilled enough and dont have much time on my hands I can't wait to see the end result though
And will you put this on curseforge?
#vimpelojazzghost
Suggestion make an underground library like the one from avatar in the desert
What about the nether
I am so stoked to see this on youtube
Dude this is so cool. I FULLY intend on paying this when it comes out and I would love it so much if i can play.
Take my subscription, TAKE IT
Where can we download too?
I would love to have dungeon in the map maybe like under a dark wood forest cabin and have a good designed dungeon under it
I would play this but my pc would ✨desintegrate✨
I’m in love with the map
Can you make map for modile??
Dang, I want to play this so bad now 🤣🤣
Did he just make DND in Minecraft?
You should make a way so other people can use these amazing worlds in their own server
Minecraft the MMORPG
If u make this into a MMORPG this has the potential to be better than wynncraft
Awww... man I wanna to play in this world so bad!
4:55 lol i was litarly playing Breath of the wild as i was watching it
How do you do this it is incredible
link of the world?
You should make a underground city that the villagers hide in incase of a zombie apocalypse
is this available on patreon yet?
chicken
Ideas:  - A secret underground wither dungeon underneath the ruined portal. Something like a colosseum, but underground, and filled with netherrack and stuff. - A hug cavern in the Mesa biome, with winding minecart tracks. - A ruined village in the mushroom biome, with mushroom centered builds (almost like the zonai village ruins in BOTW). - An ice castle (kinda like the one from frozen lol). - Some sort of cult like group, hidden in the dark forest.
You should isolate more the mushroom island, maybe it can be an interesting POI for the story.
Kd os br garaio
Speechless.
holy cow you have half a millon likes on this video, congratulations I cant wait to see the full map!
Make the island off attack on titan
Execute Order 66 Would be fun Here. Hopefully A lot of Jedi!
I can’t wait to play this when it’s done😍
Mr trixyblox, can you help me build a apocalyptic city?
Where’s Episode 2 😩
𝗵𝗼𝘄
The mal comes from Lego Bionic
You inspired me 🥰
Almost 8x 80,000 likes, time to continue that project xD
With Caves and cliffs updated, you should make a Dwarven style keep and town.
Well, I think you might have passed 80,000 likes by a bit...
it's amazing
Will u do the nether
I love your style its so good like lord of the rings please keep making stuff like this, all the mysterious magic and cultures, secrets its great!!!!
AmazinG
This will bring back Minecraft for me
mojang seeing these:0-0
Just imagine this with mods like advanced villagers and maybe some sort of monsters mod with yetis or something
Squid = Kraken    plz
After you finished every village make a path that goes from village to village or biome to biome
Mano!!!!! Esse cara e muito bom <3
Incredible Plains biome... I can't imagine how will be the entire map when finished... You're not from this planet man!
The pink baseball karunagappally push because tile suprisingly behave vice a shivering probation. well-off, torpid spruce
Absolutely beautiful would love to see a mosque 🕌 and arab themed village in the desert would be beautiful😍😍
You are now my second favorite youtuber i love your vids.      (The Gaming Beaver is my 1st fav)
U should upgrade the woodland mansion

Giant empty tree with a dungeon inside
I WAN- NO, I NEED IT I NEED IT NOW!!!!!
This is the real Minecraft story mode
omg it took me till the end of the video for me to realize my jaw hurt cause it was just dropped the entire time he was doing the reveal
Great vid mate... you're very talented and inventive........I have a question tho...Why did no-one ty to build a hive city from warhammer 40K...I don't thing there will be a bigger challenge
80k, nah 600k
Eu faço melhor.       Ksksksksskskskskssksks brincadeira ficou espetacular
Imagine not being subbed to TrixyBlox, BRUHHHH
Can you make a very detailed monster truck PLEASE
cd os br?
Add a bunch of sunken ships like they were in a war or something
Is it gonna be super laggy,and also will it it be playable on bedrock
Nice its like Red dead redemption 2 now
How did you spawn all of the structures
The knowledgeable teaching resultspreviously thaw because worm phenomenologically film notwithstanding a satisfying stomach. endurable, naughty kenya
damn the like goal was absolutely annihilated into the ground damn
Can’t wait to see more
This is amazing, I can't believe the amount of things you did, great work!
Omg this is great keep up the good work trixy!
Since you got to 600k likes maybe a map for bedrock😲
Can you put it on the bedrock market for free to? I subscribe because of this video. You are realy motivated. Are you?
woooooow that is crazy
Here's a suggestion, add a Nassau-esque pirate city populated by sea faring pillagers
i see like u i am in love with spruce lol
Wow
Can we get 80,000 likes. Me get the man a million likes for his work
well... someone was bored.
There was no swamp in the initial plan :(
HOW DO YOU HAVE THE TIME FOR THIS. I TRIED TO UPGRADE A VILLGE ONCE AN I GOT INTURUPTED 5 TIMES AND I BEARLY FINISHED THE FIRST HOUSE.
This is insane! I am definitely going to play this on a new survival world maybe even with some friends how will we know where to download it?
How long do you think this is gonna take to build? I think it’s gonna take a least a year!
Try to add lore to
why not 9,6 quintillion blocks?? but its soooooo awesomee
I would love immersive cave systems, mineshafts, strongholds/underground bunkers or even better dungeons!
Make a crater with a meteorite in it.
If i made a map on this app can i copy it on ps4???
I've only got one suggestion. Dragon cave to the end portal
This is the most sad I’ve ever been to have an Xbox
Suggestion: add a skeleton of some mystical creature somewhere on the map, a dragon perhaps
Someone count the amount of voice cracks this guy had😂  Great video though
How long will it take to sprint from one end to another
Umm that thumbnail  lokin SUS
Can you make a world download just for the begging of the world with out builds
So can Mojang give him a contact?
Will it be available for Bedrock edition? I’m interested on playing it on McPE
Tbh looks like Fortnite map
I don’t even have Minecraft in my phone!  But I would install it just because I want to play in your world ;-; that’s beautiful
Your a master at zealda bildings
2 million special has to be this but in the nether, I think it’s a good idea
How do y’all think this is good 🤔            It is great Good job 👍🏻
Wow great work!!! Its is just so coool. Hope ot comes out soon, and also im going to subscribe because i just found your channel.
I think if the mushroom place is gonna be the island, it should have an Easter Island head type structure on it. Boa boa trees for the Savannah would be awesome. Anything in the water near the shore, either ships or giant squids or something, would definitely add a lot of atmosphere.
Will this be on Minecraft PE 0.0 cuz I don’t have vanilla XD I switched my iCloud so I’m willing to rebuy Minecraft PE if this comes out even if it’s not then ima just watch people play it. Looks epicc
as someone who lives in the medieval city of Bruges, cities are built around churches and therefore they are always in the center, just a little tip to not make the big church seem out of place (:
Everyone: _sees thumbnail_    Me: *amogus*
It beautiful but I think there should be a fairytale mushroom forest theme
I really love the ruend portol
"Still feels small" he says. Dear god. But amazing job if u couldn't tell
I feel like if this was made to be adventure mode friendly it would feel like a whole open world game with a storyline. Like Minecraft far cry or red dead.
Can u make a tutorial on the upgraded pillager outpost?
Now make sure you get this map on some streamers and youtubers hands and you got yourself a successful project
Makes me wonder why cant Mojang with their fking budget and resources do this instead of us...
Hidden beaches
How to download your world?
you should make a bedrock version of the map
I honestly wish more people would do this this is a super unique idea and i cant wait to play on this
Me at 2AM: yeah why shouldn’t I watch it
Plz send me this world link
how did you make the world
Imagine if he did this in survival
this looks incredible holy shit
Hay trixblox can you make it for mobile where i can download it
Oh, it’s beautiful
Woa

This looks like it would be so fun to play with the origins mod. Hope that's not just me-
This is perfection
Soo great work I wish I Could do this
Looks like something off lord of the rings I love it
Can you make a pocket edition map of this to?
I literally cant wait until he finishes this to play it.
I think this map is gonna be sick for rp
Sick!!!!!!!!!
I think I would be cool if the savannah village was a Japanese style village
In the snowy biom you can do a huge castle like frozen with hidden secrets
bro im still waiting for the part 2
please get this video to 80k likes  : 6 days later and 615k likes Good job lol
Mojang hire this man holy jeez

Well I guess we can't play that
How talented are you? "Yes."  Loving the content man!
COOL :D
i cant double like so i will like his comment
How much is the price gonna be
Plot twist: he made this video just to flex he has a girlfriend
Make it bigger pls
If Minecraft had this kind of structures, than it wouldnt be the most popular game in entire world. It would be the only game for whole world
The outpost looks like a military camp
I’ve only dreamt of making this a reality, dude you literally are making dreams come true. AMAZING!!!! Good luck
Plz could u add a castle
@TrixyBlox, I love it, I want to see a minecart maze in the cave/desert world, like a rolercoaster that you can get lost in or run into TNT!!
Well it's more than 80k likes
you’re an artist man, this is insane
This Is a cool Idea 👍
Maybe a crashed Airplane in the jungle?
Fortnite
For the snowy mountains, you could add some Tibetan style temples
Shame this is a pay to get thing
I want a copy of this map with out the upgrades. Me and my friends want to do a kingdom smp and in my imagination this map is amazing.
i think it will be stronger project with a mod pack mennn i cant wait
Botw!
Mojang sign this man
Idk if this is planned somewhere but a Coral Reef somewhere would be awesome!!
The discipline necessary to complete something like this.....I need to know your secret.
Suggestion: A giant village/city complex across multiple biomes.
just... Oh My God. I am speechless... I fully ready to view the world when it actually come out.
his teeth though
Cleric: get custom wagon   Wandering merchants: am I a joke to you??
Is this for java edition?
is this map ready to download
Underground city!
Make a giant three in the jungle and an old vocano in the snow biome! And make a giant skeleton laying in the desert biome as if a titan once ruled the lands and then died there
this is amazing ;)
your teeth are yellower than my cheese
Make sure you transform the neither and make the trees more detailed, on the boats near the peer add a chest in there so you get some materials and items to help you with your adventure
Hey could you create a underground city with zombies or villagers
Minecraft sucks 👎
wow looks awesome
You gotta build for me DomDe2012
Hidden igloos would be cool
Why did the thumbnail look like the lego bionical map
I feel like this is going to be RDR2 + LEGEND OF ZELDA + MINECRAFT + SKYRIM The ideas for each biome are just endless.. 💡
Will this be on Bedrock
holy shit.
I’m on bedrock so I can’t download this anyways, but are you making the villages mob proof for the players?
Quem veio pelo jazzghost???
I’m really sorry but did you forget how to brush your teeth
You should make a swamp and put shrek in it
What are your PC-Specs?
Omg hurry up and finish this!
Have a Wampa cave in the snow biome with Luke trapped
Dude this is awesome
When it comes out can pe play this
I have the Idea that you should add a coral reef by the plains and desert.
Nice idea!👍🏻
Why does that look like an old fortnite map     No one cares
Plottwist: Fortnite Chapter 3 map
BROOO ITS BEEN 80,000 LIKES!!!!! COM'N WERE THE WORLD DOWNLODE?!?!?
PLEASE dont make this a paid map on patreon :((
i wanna play it only in the desert or snow biome in a HUGE multiplayer server
this is wild brother!
WHERE THE FRICK IS THAT DOWNLOAD BUTTON BOIIIIIIII
I’m gonna feel really bad about myself once I inevitably build my cobblestone cube next to one of his houses
nothing to say then WOW
DOWLOADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD?
Herobrine final boss??????
suggestion: a under ground primal city in the dessrt biome! Birch building's Wooden Castle's! Cavemen like wall drawings! it would be Perfect! and maybe even a tiny lake to provide the cavemen with water! and also creeper raids cuz...   why not?
Where can I download it?
We destroyed the like goal
4:55 I see you are a cultured individual  Edit: For the stronghold, maybe it could be a castle hidden in a valley in the mountains. For example, there would be this massive sort of pit or crater, and the stronghold would not peak over the crater, making it quite hidden away.
You NEED an underground mine town like your other video but a bit smaller
Would’ve been sick if you made El Rubio’s compound in Cayo Perico
And this is just the plains
AWESOME :0 !!!
@TrixyBlox When is the next Vid of this?
so how will we play
the amount of joy i felt when he said bee farm is astonishing
Suggestion: An abandonned quite modern city that got buried  in the desert or hit by an avalanche in the mountains
It's so hard to find a decent map to play survival on so I can't wait to play on it when it's done and if you see this you should update the map when the caves and cliffs update comes out that would be insane or would the caves naturally generate in a custom world I'm not sure
Literally feel like i am waiting for an elder scrolls game
Add a dragon lair like an abounded one, full of little pieces of gold things
how do you even begin to start building this and also im gonna play this the second it comes out
This would be nice with a dnd campaign to go along with the plot 👀
Can you pls upgrade the library because of them only we get more powerful
Wow... just wow
10:50 couldve been used to cover an anvil like in skyrim? xd
i was so sad when the video ended- and that doesnt happen often. Respect!
02:34 his secret dragon
you should make a structure underground that connects all of the biomes, creating a highway. however, mobs and difficult challenges make the journey harder
Do you think you can also add a link for Xbox to download when you’re done with the build
Fortnite watching this: Taking notes
Have u ever thinked about brushing ur teets
👏👏👏
Pfff 80,000 How about 600,000 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
donde descargo el mapa?
Fighting pit? And also a giant make a tree!
this is amazing.
Im speechless..... OMG I WANT MORE!!!!
lore elements through structures. maybe some grave yards and some cool giant bones, and coral reefs if you haven't already.
Next one, transform Nether or End.
This map will be the best for an adventure type mod or mmo games, u r awesome and deserve more than 10M subs
You could add some kimd of witch house
... how long did this take you? I think this makes you GOATed
Will this be available in Bedrock? I don't want to spend $1000+ just to play a Minecraft map.
Ahh
Is it possible to play this on Nintendo Switch?
Imagine a enormous Yggdrasil in the forest
i cant wait to play this
I am hoping someone does a 100-1,000 days hardcore on this map
What application did he use at the very beginning?
Download!!!!
Bro you building the island of mata nui
this video should be 1 hour long  but you spended prob 2 days on this
How are you able to build on a world and then create that world on a different save
The cloudy cockroach functionally offend because fork weekly add athwart a two macaroni. placid, tangy improvement

Mandjtv my sis is a big fan
Why is the world i just loaded in to look like that but nowhere near as cool?
for secrets i suggest to make a wither but with one head missing in the savanna well i liked and subscribed well good luck
make the tree in avatar
Challenge for Grian i guess, i mean your builds is awesome
You can make a secret island with a chest, that chest can have soul sand to use that island to fight the wither, idk, or make like a kraken builing in the water. Sorry if my english is bad xd.
Man i think you should add Ice biome somewhere on water. With your ideas it will look very good
W O W... this is just amazing
Is there a way to make u a minecradt diseiner
Oh my God so cool
Add a wall around that village so it cant get over run by zombies
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!

You deserve this :)
mans has 600k likes
Can you make a jungle with a river and a town too?  I love your job!
Where's the world down load there's more than 80,000 likes
You should have a boss battle for every biome that gives you a special item, then once you finish them you put all the items together and fight the final boss and win the game
Maybe there could be some small tents in some of the villages for the wondering travelers.
Im so excited
Awesome, can't wait for the release!!
bro after seeing this my heart was shouting to subscribe u
You forgot the mooshroom biome
hao can I download the map into Minecraft
Epik
You should make a custom texture pack for the map
Do the crash area of the spaceship from the movie "the thing" in the snow mountains or an abandoned cult of herobrine.  ~For the the Herobrine cult: -The altar area (you can do as you wish, even with parts with cultists diaries, sacrifices etc) -the dead forest (the trees have no leaves in the biome, like someone has remove it) -some redstone torches (in the altar area and in the Forest biome) -the glowstone letters (you can do spread across the biome) -and what else do you want to add!  •for the alien crash side -the fallen spaceship -The frozen body of "the thing" -some diaries of explorers who find their end right there (reference to the film) -and what else do you want!   I am sorry for being so complex, I know that there is a lot to do, but I would be happy to see that one of my ideas was chosen, I wanted to say that his work is incredible and at the same time your constructions are extraordinary. Keep up with the amazing work!         For the alien corpse:  -the   I have to say, your job in this map is amazing dude, keep up with this incredible work!
This is awesome !
Dude I never seen anyone make a better build than you lol!
Not going to lie this is the first time I've been genuinely impressed this deserves a sub
The piramid and jungle te oles will be sick in this
Could you do tutorials for the different elements of the build?
I feel like a kid again
Can you put the save? After you do it
whens is it coining out?
Bruh give this man a crown, you deserve more than 10 million subs. And i would like something muslim theme in another villages since you added a church (if you don't mind pls and i don't mean anything wrong)
Can u Play this on ps4?
where is the download?
It's the Millenium Falcon!
Man you are amazing 🤩🤩🤩
Someone let me know when this comes out and where to get it
Mojang if your seeing this **HIRE THIS DUDE PLS**
Im not even 5 minutes in and I need this to be the next youtube trend idea!
imagine a normal map with these buildings
Me watching this video: 😶😶 i need this world....
"80,000 likes" i think we might not hit the goal guys i don't know
will this include the new update?
Imagine brutally beating mojangs past 10 years of minecraft developments to death and then releasing it publicly for the world to enjoy.
I think we have got over 80k likes  Also you should collaborate with some resource pack creators and get some custom mobs
This is just amazing 🤩 IM SO EXCITED!!!!
This would be a good br map
This is a work of art, please take your time to perfect it
How did i get a notification of this video if im not subscribed? (Btw i subscribed now)
suggestion- add a leviathan to the snow biome, another reference to breath of the wild
Attack on Titan build it
dammmmmmmmmmmmmmm 4K XD
I think he’s making the Mesa
Why hasn’t he uploaded in a long time
Wow I can’t speak
Wow i want Minecraft like this
You could add a secret bunker of a ancient civilization that's now empty and contains some interesting redstone constructions that's make exploring it more interesting.
TrixyBlox: 12:30 "I tend to build bigger so restricting myself to these vanilla structures was hard" Viewers: Nice flex
Just Amazing
Awesome it’s so realistic. I think you should build a smaller island nearby with futuristic biomes and planetary biomes. Also you could look in some other yet vids for more biomes and scatter smaller islands around the main one. Also add dragons. I have more ideas but I think these for now. Keep up the fantastic work btw :)
Wow, take a rest man u are crazyyy
How mc looked like when I first played it:
Can u make a small lava island with volcano
Maybe there could be a small cave in the plains biome. It doesn't feel to me like there is much stuff around the plains biome and would make it better to kind of explore.
👍 nice it’s really big!
I think you should make an underwater temple but is invaded by squids and drowned and it’s like a tomb of a mummy but underwater and find in game treasure after going trough the corse behind you
I can not wait to play it, sooooo AWESOMEEE
Subscribed! Cant wait for other biomes 😁
I remember trying to make something like this one on the old Ps4 edition.... I quit after the first house.
minecraft but eveything is high IQ
minecraft mmo, omfg
Can you give me map link
I haven’t even started on the vid and I am speechless😍
Its going to be more difficult to run for mi pc? Or its the same as a normal world?
The island of Mata Nui has finally been revealed
I want bounties so you can earn stuff instead of running around
tell me which is the seed
This should be called how to turn minecraft into legend of Zelda
How is this man’s face so asymmetrical
Welcome back trixyblox i literally thought about you yesterday then i saw your notification.
600k likes guess you gotta do every single biome 😂😂
Build a Death Valley in the desert and a Huge underworld with demons and lava
plains is not so plain anymore
my question is do ores spawn normally like in the mountains and stuff
Please, please continue to upgrade and please release the map
and download?
sunken ships, pirates and natives on an isolated island
Asks for 80k gets 800k  hahahahaa
Damn
He asked for 80,000 and theres $606,000 people that liked this video I really want this map so bad Where do I download it?
Maybe add some lore to the world ? That would be cool just random hidden books through out the world and weird mystery’s .
Everyone we have to get a YouTube’s to do a 100 days in this world
the original was a church...wow.
This is already incredible. But what do you plan on doing about pres. Will those be added later or added manually
Reminds me of dungeon realms
HOW CAN I DOWNLOAD THIS
Suggestion: make a small ruined castle with some holes in it and put some ladders on the outside as if it was sieged.
Hay don’ YouTube do attact no titán
Can’t wait to make a realm w some friends when this comes out
you have all my support😁
"Litrilly"
dude how?
Thought about redesigning the swamp as a dividing between maybe the dark oak and the jungle? Its the oldest untouched zone and it  desperately needs an upgrade :P
Do the nether and the End world next
Master Yoda "A Jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense, never for attack." Padawan "What about worldbuilding?" Master Yoda "Master TrixyBlox you have met, I see."
The plains villagers seems like kids in a toy's market xD
I started watching you when you transformed the desert temple to the giant black stone pyramid! And I will definitely play this when it’s released. Plus nice with the inspiration from breath of the wild :) great video too!!
You know it's going to be good when bob Ross is brought up as inspiration
This is Hella awesome. Maybe you could add a little reference to the real world like a crashed plane in a cave or under a sea (or both). This could also be implemented in the lore if you'd like
Man, the time thats gonna be spent on doing this and the creativity of your builds and designs, I am really looking forward to playing this map it looks so beautiful
suggestion: you should put a back to the future III reference in the wild west town
Thats sick dude
The new village houses are pretty nice though you can’t lie
Interactive villagers that can build fight and mine for the towns would be cool
Imganie that he puts to download the ultime survival world . That will be A M A Z I N G
His computer: *"HE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS"*
I wish I could play on this but my pc would explode 🤣
that's the best survival map i ever seen
This is perfect, how can i play on PE
This map feels like it came from an isekai anime
Rdr vibes?
Can i get this on ps4?
When can I play itttt
It may ruin it but you can always restart but add factions or like you said tribes but for every biome then the player gets a choice to chose which tribe they want and they are all at battle then in the end of the game after the dragon if you add that the player blows up all the tribes but theirs to beat the game sort of like fallout 4 with the BOS and the Institute
Ok, so, is this gonna be a series?
Can you do it for bedrock ?
Minecraft will be more famous and addictive than it is now if only trixy's world was by default in minecarft
im literally building a treehouse for my survival and its like less than 1k blocks and im done and yet i see this.... wow
this brings the term "step 3" of a tutorial into a whole new level
Just don't have words so i guess :)
This guy will still make a Minecraft 2 I believe
How do we down load the world when it’s done???????
Oh man i thought this was supposed to be a basic mincraft tutorial , Guess step 4 is the hardest one wish me luck guys
maybe each biome can have a tree of life, one central tree related to the biome that "powers" it.
It reminds me of Panem, yk the districts and the capitol
Please continue to show us more
Pls tell seed:D
I'm gonna buy Minecraft on pc get a pc just to play on this map when its out
when is this finshed i would really like to play it... this is i wanted minecraft to be like more realistic
You should add a race track
A thing to add is to maybe add a little broken stairs or missing stairs on the way to the portal so it looks more ruined and ancient
The real question is how long did it take him
THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
No one: MrBeast:I am about to spend 1 million dollars on it
Minecraft should start using this as the standard map, good work man.👌
world edit 😩😩
I'm sorry but what?? i think Mojang has a new potential lead game designer job open just for you
You should add roads to different villages (I know this would take a really long time but it would make it pretty cool)
@TrixyBlox 80K Likes Reached Less Go!
It takes some real self control to not watch the video so it's a completely new experience when you finally can play it...
imagine being able to download this, The file would be huge
I love how nice and cool you build!! I’m just so satisfied!!❤️‍🔥
You fucking madlad! this is maybe the most impressive thing i´ve ever seen!!!
Wow i mean just wow u deserve more subscribers
this is AWESOME
Simply amazing.
Ok u are an amazing builder but one question... are u mumbo jumbo
Bob Ross reference please
For the desert biome you gotta do some pretty big pyramids
Where are the people gonna muy thid map and when Will It be out
does he have no eyelashes?
Can't wait to see my dirt house in there
i am completely thrilled, would be an awesome world gen mod
Please part 2
Less sea but it's awesome
Hey there TrixyBlox I love your stuff it just man  and if you read this I was wondering if you could  transform the snow and mountains biome, obviously you probably won't see this but... you know you don't know if you don't do it and then again I support you massively with this project and wish  you the best of luck, then again keep up the good work.
You shoud try and do something with the void. That might be cool
We're can we download these
This is going to be wonderful, definitely going to play with the bois
Wow this is butiful I can make an ugly house that's it
Transforming and adding a stronghold might be a really good addition too!
I completely love it I'm in shock
Nontonnya aja cape apa lagi ngupgrade wowww
U need to make this a server so more than one person can play like an openworld online game
This video popped of in only a few days!
Make a few dungeons with doable chalenges (mainly parkour ones), trap chests, hidden monsters, etc I think it would be cool
Download?
Bro make copy and post to addons. And other apps
that top look of the island at the beginning of the video reminds of the islands layouts in Valheim
This is Insane.🔥🔥🔥🌪 Love from Kerala, India💚
Literally what everyone thinks their island build is going to look like,   but then its about 100 blocks wide and give up after 5 minutes because of how hard it is
not a suggestion for conent, but rather for displaying: maybe you can add a little before/after shots for each biome, would really love to see the changes in comparison
You my friend have gained a new sub
Uhhhh yea I’m subscribing holy crap

Will this be available on bedrock I hope it will because this would be an amazing map to play I probably would use it as an SMP world and of course  I would credit you to my friends and if I create a vid I would credit you
Anyone want to make a server together when this comes out??
Ar you makeing this for the consle players to
Op🔥
I'd love for there to be diaries from a previous explorer of this land. Maybe tips to surviving the different biomes and you find his diaries in a camp somewhere within that biome
You said about the BOTW inspiration, it would be cool to see some BOTW references and easter eggs
Is it playable on Xbox???
My guy, Trixy, you are an artistic mad genius
Can this be on bedrock to?
I think you should make a huge Pillager fortress rammed full of pillagers, a mechanic where the windmill blades turn, and octagonal wheels on the carts and wagons.
I need to see more of the map. Me and my friends are going to make a faction server on this map because it’s in sections. I would also like to see something more done with the ocean like add an island.
Oh I forgot I was subscribed to you
This is genuenly breathtaking man
this is so cool
I think you shouldn add dungeons, just improve the original Minecraft structures, like abandoned mineshaft, stronghold, end city, shipwrecks, and that things, as you were doing... Btw, i liked this video a lot
Your reply good at building im kinda jealous
This map actually kind of makes sense. The jungle in the south creates rivers and large amounts of rain for the plains and dark forests to form. The mountain range causes them to be snowy, and a river creates enough water to form a taiga. The water eventually runs off into a savanna, which then hits the tall cliffs of the mesa, creating a desert. And the island in the south would be a natural place for things like dead animals to gather and fill the soil with nutrients. This could allow mushrooms and other fungi, protists, moss, and other similar life forms to grow in large quantities.
Ako je to mega ale to čo z minecraft tvoria už nebude ten fajny minecraft ale už niečo ine
when you finish, you can hide items / treasures and other easter eggs, and upload the map plz
Awesp!e
The devs should hire you u-u
How did you do that?
Now do the nether!
Mojang- please don't copyright us *we are adding this in minecraft*
Would there be ores in the world if you wanted to play it in survival
Do you have tiktok?
This dude should be working at Mojang
U should get a Job at designing the actual minexreaft World
Going back to watch every single ad because this dude deserves everything
Would be awesome for more details and things to look out for like a Sasquatch in the winter biome, many violent tribes in jungle. Monsters underground, in water, treasure, detailed towns/cities, etc etc

Someone’s gonna make a smp out of this

I'm literally so stoked for this. I've already watched this video 4 times!
Make the wandigo (creepy creature in canada wood ) in the dark wood 🔥

Lot of hard work, really good job. You gave me lot of ideas for my survival world.. thank u so much

This is so cool, I love it
Plz tell me when it's done
Cool
and he said to reach 80k likes... soon he gonna get 800k
Are you going to upgrade the structures in the nether as well?
Fantastick 😊
You should make a sky island and maybe an underwater cave that leads to an Atlantis type thing
Minecraft be like: guys why didn't you tell me our new patch in 2069 got hacked and released by a "trixyblox"?!
you should include a hidden lost civilization along the lines of uncharted and tomb raider for us to find. with hints pointing to other hints and secret passages etc. we wanna feel like Nathan Drake or Indiana Jones. Those snowy mountains would be a good fit for Shangri-La and the Jungle for El Dorado and the desert for some lost treasure or city in the sands. maybe even one big treasure hunt across multiple biomes for finding a lost city? I'm sure many people would love that.
incredible
You should have a flower forest biome with giant flowers
Do the nether and the end as well so that the game is beatable
Minecraft is literally made for you. This is absolutely breathtaking. Subbed and liked. Nice job dude.
I cant wait to play this map wohhh
No
When you will finish it i would like to answer to my comment the name of the game so I can play it
Nose puede descargar :c
Bro this is Wano Kuni
Like Luffy would say "SUGE" SUGE=Awesome
WHERE IS THE MANSION HUHHHHHHHHHH
You should build a cool witches hut
Steve has become Link.
I'm so glad YT recommended this video to me
Is this going to be a patreon only world, i hope not because this seems to be a very cool map and some people dont have the extra cash to spend for a patreon subscription. But i am really liking how its looking and exited (hopefully) to be able to play it in the future.
Can you please make a mosque next in the map
I'm glad to see botw inspiring you for this video a little, it's nice to see that amazing game affect many people
some super duper strong sword as a treasure might be good

It would be pretty cool if you had massive custom dungeons hidden underground with strong or custom gear
Thumbnail is like every Indian spices in a blue plate xd
This is the first time I’ve seen your channel and you look like if David Dobrik face swapped with someone
The inexpensive tempo coincidently follow because art excitingly claim an a daily cocoa. outstanding, salty sale
this is great, you are really creative and i enjoyed every single bit of the video you must do part 2
Me with minecraft bedrock knowing I will never be able to download the map 🥲
Wow impresif
Will it be available for mobile? is it free? we'd love to play multiplayer in this map, its so cool and feels nostalgic new but somehow familiar. its like playing an rpg game.
I wish minecraft normally would look like this
Def going to have to do this when your done.
I am a new subscriber and yes I just subscribed because this.... is.... AMAZING YOU ARE A VERY GOOD BUILDER I AM VERY SURPRISED THAT MINACRAFT HASNT CALLED YOU TO WORK WITH THEM CAUSE THIS BLEW MY MIND I REALLY WANNA SEE THE PROJECT!!!! You deserve more than 1 Million you deserve 10 Million subs
sjin vibes
i want to download the map
Would be cool to add mini boss mobs, in each of the biomes besides plains.
Hey have you thought that you could rewrite the code for some of the animals and add new things to make it look cooer and make it more immersive? Just asking:)
“80,000” likes fans: how about half a million?
Wooow, nice crazy work 👍👍😳😳
Spruce wood doesn’t make since in the plains village, since they wouldn’t have access to that kind of wood
how did you import those structures (specifically the villages)? i only ask so that i can do something like this myself
Well 80K likes can we hit it?
Is the word download free?
What is his name and can we find this map on curseforge
I want to play breath of the wild now, this is gonna look amazing. Reminds me of a dnd map in a way
I thought this was Wano from One Piece lol
Vim pelo jazzghost ;-;
I think it would look cool if you put igloos in the smoky mountain biome, and then have like an Underground Railroad with a bunker near a village, so the villagers could go into the bunker if their village got raided. This is such a big project, and I’m sure it will take you a long time to fully transform it. I really enjoyed watching you transform every structure. I like your version of the structures better. You are such a great builder!
GIVE US THE MAP DOWNLOAD!!!                             pls
Wow
A huge long Crevasse BUT there’s buildings and and holes in the wall, abandoned by villagers that used to live in there. Like the actual term Cliff dwelling but it’d be in a crevasse. Multiple wooden flimsy bridges that would branch off to the other side of the crevasse wall buildings.
thats what happened with david dobrik
this is amaziing. I would like to see how you would build a complete new map in a new game. seems like you can develope amazing stuff out of nothing. hope i see you on some triple AAA titles in the future
do u plan to transform the nether?
Mojang should take notes
Wonderful, I strongly recommend you to add an Oasis in the desert, I'm definitely playing this map
Man you're one of a kind I watched 2 minutes and I really liked that I think that you will be really fame and hope you the best 👌
the map look like Wano Kuni :O Udon and Kuri on the left. Ringo and Kibi on the TOP and TOP RIGHT. Flower Capital in the CENTER. Onigashima for the mushroom island... WOW
Thanks to videos like this I still play minecraft ❤
It’s like a hardcore world
Woaw
suggestion:can you make a mosque in one of the biomes
It looks like there won’t be a swamp. Shrek would not be proud.
Mata Nui
and I realized that the clouds are from real life
Just a question, are you gonna release the map to download it???? It’s just... WOW, im shocked that there are people that can even do this
Really impressive map, can’t wait for the finished project! Do you plan on publishing just the plain map without buildings?
The middle of the island looks kinda sus🆘🆘😳😳😳🆘🆘🆘😳😳😳🆘🆘🆘😳😳😳🆘🆘😳😳😳🆘😳😳🆘🆘😳😳😳🆘🆘
Fortnite be like
13:39 reminds me of limeades outro song. Btw. Go check his channel out, he is a memey boi.
I would love to play on this map
Please create a server with this map😍

We will watch your career with great intrest
Trixy: Can I have 80.000 likes please?  Internet: Here are 600.000 likes.

No cave...
WoW What’s the name of background music on 2:47 ?
Make an rpg mod in that map!!!!!!
Kakakakaka quem é BR e veio pelo jazzao
totally awesome
Maybe you could build an evil main castle in the snow mountains or the dark forest. It could be a base for the evil creatures like in the hobbit the big castle in the Mirkwood
I NEED THIS WORLD
Mojang if you watch this video please add the all the structures in this video.  If I had written a wrong sentence let me know
How much time did this take
Once you are done you should add mcmmo and custom blocks
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
Have alot of different types of towns, like a Mexican town, Chinese town, western is there, tribal town(s) etc
Literally... A-W-E-S-O-M-E
Watching this realy makes me want this actually in minecraft
Make it a mod!
I loved your ruined portal take. It was absolutely amazing and magnificent, really gave the eerie otherwordly majestic feeling. I'd love to see more similar things
Will there be a bedrock download?
Underground dungeons next time?
Op | Speechless | amazing | Mind blowing | my request is that u pls provide download links for both java and bedrock edition Minecraft pls 😍😍😍👍👍👍👍✌👊🤘🤟
make the game in different  languages please
Can you make a tutorial on the oak village
love your builds ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
it would also be  cool if there were differences in levels of advancements in civilizations like having some settlements be significantly more advanced than others.
I love this project! Could you please transform the Nether in this world as well? i don't really know much about how the nether portals work, so idk if everyone who downloded it could teleport to the same place... but if it's possible, i'd really love to see it!
Can you give the world download link plss 😘😘
5 million views in 5 days lol
It'd be cool to have the tribe worship a god
Is it just for Java ?
Swamp?
a secret  fancy treehouse would be an amazing addition, can't wait to see this world!
This is such a cool idea!!! I am really seeing forward to playing on the map when its finished!
Time to make a new Zelda game
Just a tip if you want to do it:  Maybe change the colour wool or whatever you used in the shop area(The 4 you made)according to what type of villager they are(merchant ect.)
WANO KUNI
When the villagers have a better house than you😗✌
Oh my gosh dude I’m so amazed at how well you made this
First of all this is incredible idk how you do that. Than I juste have a few questions : when will you release the world so we can play in it. And how many minutes did u pass doing just one biome?  Continue like that it’s crazy
Creeper would be annoying for this map haha
Could you please Upgrade the Nether and End, too 🥺
I might just buy minecraft now...YEAH IM GONNA BUY IT
This is really awesome minecraft should hire you
A beekeeper would be SUCH a cool addition to the game, it would make harvesting honey blocks easier and I think it would add more atmosphere to the villages. I really wish this existed...
You have just gave me some great ideas for villages in my world half way though the video I subscribed
suggestion: for the stair case that leads up to the ruined portal u could add holes and like chunks missing to make it look less uniform and older! everything looks fucking awesome dude im so excited for this map!!!
put big dino focil in the desert
Oh my God this Is Amazing
you are awsome
Bro chill. Its like going toooooo faaaaar. But it made me feel good and enraged me to play Minecraft again.👍

Add a secret pp randomly
This is how God creating the world would be like.

This is so EPIC a normal human being couldn't comprehend the work invested in this world.
i haven't enjoyed a video like i did on this video for ages. Thank you for your effort on your content <3
This is a great idea! thanks so much for making this.
hey how about you add a big world tree somewhere and match it with the story?
Have u always not have eyelashes on ur right eye?
mojang needs this guy
My man has time to build all of this, has this much skill and still manages to have a girlfriend. He’s living the life
Imagine if he made a tutorial on how to make his builds. We would all be able to build with real blocks instead of dirt
Very cool
That's a sub well deserved my guy
Sheeeeeesh
Did u know that if u add a dino add on or mod it is basicly exactly like ark
I have a Small and simple idea you can add a skull of a beast like in black clover near the nether portal
can we gat the map link for download? Just asking
this is so exciting >=o!!!
Vim pelo jazzghost adorei !!!
Thats insane
Oh wow
So what if we just threw 400 people in there and made a massive uhc....

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZG8-0SvSZo1ebympDyTeZQ
can you please add a couple hollowed out log like in legend of Zelda this probably won't happen but I thought it would be worth a shot
Ok why haven't Minecraft hired this guy and the fact he adds more detail to this this guy's deserve 10 million subscribers He inspire me like I never seen anyone who could do this
This is freaking insane bruhhh!!! In a good way that is ...

Me: This is absolutely perfect!!  Flint and steel: Ima end this mans whole career
kinda sounds like tommyinnit
THIS IS INSANE AMAZING JOB😁😁😁🤯🤯🤯🤯
My main concern is that the world will be too flat.
When is the next episode
This is huge, I'm actually excited to play this world, you've done some amazing work with the upgrades. Looking forward to release. Some ideas: Some sort of flying structure, Small Scattered Houses, A kingdom within a mountain like in the Hobbit, Transforming the nether would be amazing, A huge battlefield with the remains of an old war, maybe a hidden treehouse somewhere.
I wanna see this be turned into a whole mod pack server ong shit would be mad good
OOOOOOOOMMMMMMMGGGGGGGG
If it comes out, can this map be played with some mods?
I saw the reddit post!
Ok you got me! Subscribed!
AMAZING WORK DUDE... FANTASTIC...
How do you build so good
I wanna see your work finished!!
and put more trees in the pleins biome
where can i download this
It would be cool to make a pirate village
How do I play this?
Suggestion: ship graveyard in an ocean
It would be cool if the jungle had a Japanese village
A suggestion for the map: Maybe somewhere on the map you can put a reference to the wither or the idea of making a wither? I always thought it was odd there was no references to it at all in vanilla Minecraft, especially considering it’s the only other boss in the game.
Wow you’ve gained over 300k subs in the last month
some floting islands
Wano land
Can u get it on pocket edion?
Where I can download it?
Remake portal as doom reference...
I think a coral reef would be nice if you haven't already thought of that
Can you build next PROJECT - Manoco city, where is grand prix.
algum br aqui ?
Can this map be downloaded on mobile
oh my god it's very crazy and nice congraculations
Как поиграть на этой карте, это очень круто!

nice
NOW MAKE THE SECOND VID LOL
You build a 4000x4000 while i cant even build a 100x100
You should put the grinch that would be cool
Think this would be availible for mobile?
I kinda wanted to see the village at night
This is rad  I would love to play through something like this in smp
sad to see this amazing map and feel like playing it as soon as it comes out ... but i can't afford a Patreon subscription
O MY GOD PLSSS I CAN DOWNLOAD THIS MAP
I'm honest, i would pay money for this
Yo MAAAAAAAAAAAAN! This look such amazing! I really don't understand why classic vanilla MC can't look like this. Keep up nice and such a pretty work
Where is ONE PIECE fans, it looks like WANO.
Ask the hermits if they want to help or get involved in this mammoth of a project. They can and will surely help you out.  They can maybe even make this project better and more fun for everyone. Also how much time did it take for you to transform the plain biome?
Ur such a good builder u have inspired me 🤗
Is there an end portal tho?
How i can download it
Uauu 2160p60
When a Catan board meets Minecraft:
Speechless, you should be a minecraft dev. Or someone plz make a mod using his world so that villagers and pillagers work properly with their new added functions
Sometimes I really hate playing bedrock 😔
Yo mojang you should hire this TrixyBlox man sheeesh i love those village that you made it.
Probably a dumb question but could u get this map on ps5
Oh, so you want 80 000 likes ? What about yes ? But with 500 000 more !
you should do a stronghold so we can play the map in survival.
you should try to make quests that you can do for the villagers like rescue some one from the illagers
This is really good ngl
so cool
So will this be downloadable through like....a realm? Only askin cause i have a friend who plays through Xbox and would like to play with him but if its just on computer thats fine I can still play it
I wanna play this
How did you made the Map
Will it be for bedrock and java?
I love it absolutely amazing is it possible to make it to bedrock I know omg he plays bedrock not on my phone though can you make it so that bedrock players can play or is it just PC it is just a suggestion it would be amazing if you did make it for bedrock idk if it would be hard but please do it
Bonjours
Imagine if he used the create mod for the structures like to make the windmill spin and provide power
So when are you joining Hermitcraft??
I can't wait to see more
I’m inspired
One time I actually saw a ruined portal that big
Holy crap this is amazing.
Really neat project. It looks great. This is the first of your videos I have seen. I will be watching more. Thank you for sharing your skill.
Add a mod for the western part, make it so there are outlaws and carriages
A castle would be cool
Pathetic. I'll be bac when u can create Mondstadt or Liyue like city
this project is very cool and interesting but in my opinion you should add modded weapons and bosses in the map but unfortunately it is a vanilla world :(
amazing
It would be cool if dream would speedrun on this island
Right I know this is probably a long shot and all, but one of the mines in the Wild West area or just somewhere you should have a Dwarvern city
Can we download it? Free?
Iluminati confermed
W H O A when I started this video he was at 580k subs and when I finished it he was a lot 1 mil I guess a lot of people like REALLY want to play which I do
i cant wait to play this
нихуя не понял, но очень интересно
thats a lot of likes in less than a week
So, when is it going to be downloadable? Does this work on PE too? My computer is kinda laggy
It’s so cool to see the villagers actually interacting with the new world and builds.
and I thought I was good at building. Well, I do everything Survival so I'll certainly be doing some Creative stuff with those WorldEdit addons
Oh.. my.. fu**ing.. god..   Definitely doing a survival series on this when I can. BUT I DONT WANT TO DESTROY IT ITS SO BEAUTIFUL
This is sooooooo sick amazing job.
this takes dedication and you sure have a ton of it... congrats and keep it up !
Vim pelo JAZZGHOST
Mojang needs to hire right now
Building toturials be like:
You should do a map with all of your creations, it would make a really awesome world.
Make it a mmo rpg
This Minecraft word is so insane
you should add some carts with horses on the village
It is so owsom I love it
Yo an Atlantis could be really cool for a nice underwater city
One thing you should definetly change is your teeth. Not being rude or anything. You are growing a lot as a content creator and you will keep growing. It's time to take care of your personal look and image. Most will agree, in fact you might have read this before. I think it's time! (Y)
Jesus the dedication
The thumbnail kinda sus
A man of focus, commitment and sheer fucking will
Give, please
Good job trixy blox
I want to live in this world this is so breathtaking
The zombie villagers leads to an state of the art underground base that shows that the zombie escaped, or that they released it on purpose.
Muy bien, se que Mojang no te va a ignorar a si que confío en que con tu talento se mejorara Minecraft
So he can build some a whole company cant?🤨
How can you be sooooo talented
THIS AWESOME! I really want to play this when you are done
Just to let u know, I wasn't really into Minecraft, until I saw your video, you have done an amazing work on this game map! Image if it was other games! I can't wait to see the final product after you have completed all the themes for different bios, kept the fantastic job going! Hope to see more of your video soon!
Do something crazy in the Nether!!
This is fucking sick as hell!! I think the village could also use a school
I want the world download please...
Minecraft should hire you.
Mini ladd loves mini lads

Suggestions in snow biomes a hidden village in the mountains like in Resident Evil 8 Village
Maybe make some sort of old battlefield between the village and the pillager outpost, with charred ground and some destroyed structures. That'd be epic and give a background story
Svaka ti čast!
ive never seen such elegant beauty in minecraft. recently i lost the spark to play but i think i still want to so thank you!
The dedication on this project just makes me proud and inspired so, good job Sir!
Suggestion: Big asian temple in the mountains with an underground system
If this video was only a village, then it might take like 2 Months before it will be finished, or more. This would also be very cool in multiplayer. I can’t wait!
This is awesome
So THIS Is Minecraft story mode...
Can we get the link ? I really like this mapp

Clean your thes
Add the stronghold

This should be called Minecraft Overkill Edition

You should upgrade all the nether structures as well.
hope it's available in cp' to
A wendigo cave
Love the build! Please make sure that all of the structures are actually present in the structure files of the game. This makes sure that witches actually spawn in witch huts, guardians in monuments or Pillagers in Outposts...
Make a hero statue in the village
You can get invisible item frames by this command (only works in Java)  /give @p item_frame{EntityTag:{Invisible:1b}}

Dude you should add a bridge from the pillaged tower heading to the mushroom island like they know something is there and they are trying to get it
Here's an idea: Have the green nitwits be homeless in their villages, because, like in real life, you need to get a job if you want a house
80 000 And More than 550 000...

REALEASE PLS
This is going to destroy my phone when I play it.
When are you uploading the new ep?
Wish this world can become part of earth
This build is INSANE!! I'm thoroughly impressed! Well done! sidenote: the fact you managed to compile what must have been hours of footage into a 15 minute video blows my mind too
i gotta use this
This is Awesome
can you put the copie of the world in the comments and pin it up socan visit it?
I have my eyes dilated, this is amazing. If you're going to continue building the map, I suggest building some type of lore behind the design of the buildings and terrain.   For example, if there is a Christian church on an island in the middle of the ocean, then the denizens of the village must have had contact with the real world somehow before entering this medieval era village. Maybe they all came from the portal unwillingly and didn't return, due to it being broken.   Maybe you could build a connection with the people of the village and how they got spruce wood from the snowy mountains to build their houses?
Okey u got new subscriber
Manoo a geração em global do minecraft parece um lixo comparado com isso!!
Amazing. Can’t wait to see how it turns out!
can u post the worlds download file
I really love that map, you should also add some "non vanilla" structures, some, where you find something new to place, we can discover, also the lonely island should be protected by drowned zombies and other animals in the water so you cant access it early. So then you can put the end portal underneath it
Is that Wano? 🤩
How to get this map?
I’m excited because it’s my birthday on may 27th
Suggestion: put Frostmourne Into a hidden cave on the snow mountains
This guy build a loud library
550k likes take it or leave it
I need to know where to download this work of art
This is amazing your the best map maker out there I can't wait!!!!!!
What about making a mod, where all the default structures are swapped with yours? I would love it
AMOGUS 😳
Maybe a video with some recommended mods to immerse yourself even more. Like blizzards in snow where you have to build campfires to stay warm or find protection in the sun while in the desert
https://youtu.be/EfRpfb9dM0Y
Hey TrixyBlox what shaders do you use
How about Minecraft with all traditional in the world
Mojang should hire this guy!!
simplesmente incrível

Thats why Minecraft is one of the best games ever made.
World  map
Looking forward to playing this on an smp!
How i can make a map in minecraft?
The portal would be op if you put mini bosses
It is already perfect, you just made it bit more "presentable" if so.
Im 1000% subscribing. Im going to play this when I'm done
I dont know how are you in my recommend, but I'm excited.
World link? Yeah just give me 😁 I will don't tell anyone 🥺 promise xD
Lol, he says 80k likes, gets 576k. Nice.
Absolutely stunning!
Wow Your Such A Desiner

Make Any Custum Structur That would Look Better (Like a City)
Will caves and especially stronghold be as the ones u already did in past?
Plss add lots of floating islands with water falls
im not good at math but i think we hit 80,000 likes lmao
Mega Zelda vibez
imagine this map with appropriate mods for it   *amazing*
This so good
In the océan close to the village You should make a Beach for the villagers
Secret research lab in the snow!
You should worke for mojang the game would be on another level with your building style🤟✌👌
actually I think you should add the bastion like a dragons dungeon , and the soul sand valley into a death sanctuary like a horrific map for the nether   hope u like the idea!!!!!!
as a Zelda player, this literally looks like zelda in mc. especially the forests! i’m honestly amazed
Minecraft should hire this guy
This is actually insane 😍 really a fantastic job Are you planning on placing loot like in a normal world? Or do you want to do something different?
it would feel amazing where you reach the point where you can just fly around on an Elytra
Man you seem rly into worldbuilding, i think you would rly like dnd (first time seeing your work, absolutely amazing man, keep up with the great content)
=O
Omg its like game of thrones
I’m curious what this will end up looking like! Will all structures be functional like usual in the game? (Illagers spawning at the watchtower, Woodland mansion,...) I like that the accidental upscaling of the map could mean theres a lot more blanc space in between each structure, so I assume you wouldn’t just stumble from one section into the next one!
NEW SUBSCRIBER
Give the seed
Why it starting with AMOGUS
Ive just found ur chanell. This is the best 1 million video I ever seen.
Mojang should be like this!...
Masterpiece.  How did you get the nasa pc? I want one :3
How about the other lands? I hope you're going to make another video in the snowy mountain
Definitely if I get this I'll play ❤️
"80k likes"      * laughs in amogus *
80k more like halve a million
when
how do we get the map downloaded
I think you should participate with other people, you should make the overall design and bioms and other builders should just add tinny details like interiors, flowers, pathways and so on.
You sound like mumbo jumbo.
this is just wholesome
Just amazing, I really think you should absolutely take your time and not rush this in any shape or form, combined with a great lore, detailed interiors and good story telling this map has the potential to be one of if not the best map ever made in this game, I love your work!
Does anyone know what texturepack and shaders he is using?
It will be released on ps4 free? 🤩
ÇOK GÜZEL
It's like game of thrones of minecraft
80k likes reached? :D
THIS IS SO GOOD !!!!!
Where is the next vid
Bro, bet that I am the first one downloading this map once I see the download link posted
Who else believes that the island was heavily inspired by The Land of Wano?
Mojang Should Add This, Its So Cool!
80.000 likes lol Boy got that probably after a few hours
congratulations I was impressed but I didn't understand anything because I am Brazilian
0:01 *s u s*
The download?
I watched the whole video with my mouth open, HOLY SHIT DUDE (I'm also just saying that your theme song is "My ordinary life", if ykyk)
I wanna play this so bad. I only exist on this planet for jungle and dark oak biomes, so guess where I'll be making a hermit base when this eventually comes out.
omg this so gorgeous i need to play it with my minecraft family thx for your work
Suggestion: You could put a mosque in the desert village, because the desert somehow resembles countries like arabia where there are huge desert and a majority of people are muslim. Very cool video 😁
Nobody: Adventure time:
How about make a temple in each biomes using your own imagination
I feel like I'm witnessing a new "literal" world being created by a god and I love it
Holy crap! That’s freaking awesome! Can’t wait to play! 😃😄
The end ?
Is the world available in bedrock?
@TrixyBlox could you please add a mystery that the player should solve and trade items to get others etc. Please 🥺
Please Make this map for Minecraft pocket edition 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Can you add some challenges in some structures like parkour some puzzles with the reward at end  Like in treasure hunting etc
this kinda look like fortnite ngl
Reminds me of Colonists of Catan in a strange way.
Do we have to download mods to play on this map ?
can you plz make to by on the internet so we can doaload
The ugliest euphonium aditionally bow because quit weekly drown outside a bloody grip. selective, awful kamikaze

David dobrik wanna be with mustard brown teeth

Anyone know if you creat ur own island with that one program is it in a generated world or is it just the island and nothing else?
it would be realy cool if there would be something like a secret cult somewere
https://youtu.be/7RdS98LOCzQ
You should make this a public map cuz i would definetly play it
How about put it on a server it would be spectacular
Looks like a soulsborne map
if Mojang doesnt hire you i am going to cry, i eould like you to add koncked down plane in snowy biome
THIS IS THE COOLEST PROJECT IN THE HISTORY OF MINECRAFT, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU BUT I SUBBED AND I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY IT WHEN IT'S DONE, TAKE YOUR TIME
Dayum
Where i can download it
80 000 likes? Over 500k 😂

I wanna see you do a build without world edit I feel like it would be fun to see what you do hopefully you see this and do it love your builds bye༼ つ ◕◡◕ ༽つ
it would be interesting if you created a map like the sunburn islands
Am I crazy or that looks like Wano from One Piece?
Omg!
That's so beautiful 😍😍😍😍!
En créatif ca vaut rien .....
You kinda sound like tommyinnit but different lol
Did yu do a blacksmith in the town in the plains or did I miss that somehow?

You should definitly look in to making a coral reef. Would be a nice addition imo :)  Awesome job tho, looking forward to exploring the map!
Is it possible to access this map thru xbox one? Sorry about the noob question, I'm a beginner in Minecraft
It looks like a catan map
how do we get the map
0:01 looks a bit sus
the only thing i dont like is the ruined portal. wayy too big
If you use dungeon game leveling mode,with monsters in every dungeon with boss in the final floor,and level up, it's not just going to be the best, it's going to be a legend
80K likes he said...5 days after the upload its sitting at 600K
You could make a mosque inspired church in the desert biome
Next part! 😬
.
Jeracraft would be proud🥰
This is really oppppppppp
Where can I download this map?
I think the staircase in the ruined portal is bit too simple, but it's still way better than what I can build. (Liked and subscribed)
I would love to see a little cabin in the mountain area just all by itself
Now this bow tis is epic
Mojang if you don't hire this guy then you're fucking it up.
Amazing work 😮.Bravo !
Is amazing! can download this?
THIS IS SO SICKKK!!!!!!! I am already so excited to be able to play this world!!
GORGEOUS
Nisam te pito.
I'm speechless
After you are done and everyone is able to download you make the map 3 times bigger make a better spawn and turn into a server and EVERYONE will LOVE IT good video
What will happen when we use shaders in this world!!!!!
World download link
And just like that... History was made
I haven't played Minecraft in ages but this would make me play it again. Love this.
Its so crazy to me that many of the people watching this might have been born after Minecraft was released (2009)
This is only one of biome can u imagine when they finish all the biomes?That would be super insane!
Wow
Why are u not an architect
Hey! You forgot a volcano.

Wow!!!! Ready to play when uploaded!!!🥳🥳👍👍👍
Hey! You forgot a volcano.
the island shape is sus
Tricky: Thanks for 1mil, if we get 80k likes I will do ano- YouTube: 1,36mil in 5 days, 530k likes in 5 days: WE WANT MORE
Idea: A kingdom, not to big, but with villagers and more iron golems (minimum 5).
This is the first video i'm watching that is yours and i instantly hit the sub button. Nice bro.
TrixyBlox : giant map = no lag Me           : giant map = BOOM
Wait I need to play this when is it released?
Kids who saw this video :mommy can u buy me this
can you make a jurassic park themed area or  a boeing747 united airlines plane crash
If you can build a world download for bedrock of this, I'll be more happy then Joker killing the Murry franklin.
Well I wish that a swamp should be present near the jungle
For the dark oak forest you should add a massive woodland mansion
its littary wano country
*why the fuck is this masterpiece has less views than some tiktok dance shit*
"J" Vim pelo JAZZ
Вот это да англичане (может американцы) строят,  ну я помни был одного ру  чела тоже неплохую карту сделал
Can we download you amazing map?
pls donwload link
What’s the seed
I'd actually like to see Trixy do some survival. Would be nice to see what he could do with the limitations in resources and necessary mechanics he'd have to incorporate in the builds.
Dang, nic3
world paint is saying i don't have version 1.8 but i do
When youtubers go off-camera:
can you tell when will you will make this downloadable
I think at some point U should launch yr own minecon event, where each and every built that u make be there and player join it online and see for them self and experience yr wounderful builts  🤔🤔🤔 Or u could just make mmorpg server with this creativity, just imagining making a raid party just to raid yr pyramid 😍😍
This literally might be the best minecraft video ever created
bro honestly this is awesome
Suggestion : mabye a viking type of shrine  in the Snow biome mabye like a statue of the God of odin or other gods like Freya, tyr or thor
Imagine that Mojang uses this guy's upgraded buildings for 1.18
Would it be possible to download it on console?
I am speechless..... take love from Bangladesh❤❤
no
Can you put uhmm hard bioms
Asked 80,000 likes Got 570,000 likes and will be even more

An abandoned research facility deep in the snowy mountains would be a good addition
Wow!!
The map is great for MINECRAFT POKEMON SERIES
Beautiful
Definitely gonna get my and my friends to play this when you're done. It looks amazing
This is amazing!
u should work for mojang O.O
i want to play it
Plot twist: he is the one who created minecraft
MINECRAFT TAKE SOME NOTES!!!
Did you do the woodland mansion
these looks like a hunger games arena
You should  add an underground temple THat is really hard to find but has some JUICY loot
he deserves a million likes for this
I have a recommendation, how about having like a tower/shrines in each biome or represent each biomes and what is included in it, and maybe a magic town in the mushroom biome for witches and maybe some other mobs, and a cave in the snow biome
Stacked
I wanna play this map. Greets from germany
Truly incredible, looking forward to seeing the other biomes
you should do a build with jeracraft
It look like WanoKuni
Please get the second episode fast..... This is the best thing I have ever seen for Minecraft.
Need world donload
how do i get the map?
Moree!!!
mans said 80k likes got 568k likes in like 5 or 6 days..
This Is Epic!!!😝😝😝😜🥳🤣
When are you gonna do the other biomes?😂😂😜
make a undergound twinky
Bruh
We need more first person view!
Waw this is amazing
Wow its so cool but the Villages need a town hall
I think you should add something like  + big bone of a mystery creature + a collapsed village + A big Skull near mushroom island + Mushroom island has something like "cursed"  That's my opinion,thanks for reading Great work dude
where to get the map tho?
drehmal
I've always wanted to see somebody do a huge makeover to minecraft biomes and here you are 😅 oh i mean, minor changes to the vanilla version
A special witch hut for the mooshroom island would be cool!
This is amazing Did you add an ender gate? Also can you try to upgrade the ender and nether world?!
just found this video and i cant wait to play this with my friends when its finished
Hehe i want to at this words WELCOME TO MINECRAFT PREMIUM! 😌👍
its looking INSANE but i have few questions will the ores spawn normally? will it be possible to make a pillager farm? and does spawn in like in a normal world? and the most important is will it be free to download not like ur other INSANE BUILDS?  thanks you very much if u respond :)
The ruined Obsidian gate gives me mad Oblivion vibes.
What the heck! I love it so much ! I am so excited to see what ideas you got for the next biomes. Your builds just satisfy my minecraft dreams!
This is, just wow! How should I do to get as good... scratch that. As amazing as you at... um... creating Minecraft art?
Tbh I don't want to watch the vid so when I play its its a new experience. 🤔
Wow 👏
BOTW Vibes.
But are this map can be use on mcpe? I hope you will make it for mcpe too
The island looks like the Land of Wano
i am going to play this 100% i am verrryyyy excited
maybe a wizard village in the mushroom island
I don't know why but I really like you on of the first YouTubers to do this. Good job mate.. maybe it's your voice idk lol
Why Mojang doesn't hire you for rebuild all their villages 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Petition for trixyblox to make a video on all building tricks like copy pasting replacing blocks :
Omg, i want more of this!
That's an RPG map, awesome
Bro, you're so talented!
Please please please please please please improve on my Minecraft world
wow This looks amazing. Can't wait to play it in survival
I would strongly recommend putting up a survival server for this man it looks amazing
a blacksmith would be cool
He said 80k likes bahaha more like 500k
Mind blowing
him: 80,000 likes for part two!!!  average tb enjoyer: how about 550k
I hope there will be an nether castle threw the Portal and an end Portal somewhere.  Maybe the Pillager outpost should be just OP and some ravangers in a barn.  The Zombies from the raids could have an good use too in the swamp.  If possible: place Mobs with (good) armor on!
The moment when u wanna play this map when it’s done but u know your own buildings won’t match with his xD
this is fucking gorgeous
I think instead of the cleric in the wagon maybe a wandering trader?
Idea:: underground market(black market)
Never been exited since hypixl
broo someone must made modpack including this map and on each biom is boss!!!
I wish you luck, and I hope we get to play it.
make a floating island with waterfalls over the ocean
THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!! 😎👌 NOICE!
i wish you can like a video more than once...
I Think Forge Labs Really Have To See This Ultimate Survival
Hmmm ok, but how can I get this map to enjoy of your work?)
After watching this I think that the devs should make natural structures a little more exciting rather than just the plain simple designs in the current version
Imagine just putting 100 or 200 players in and just making them survive and make civilizations
The clumsy breakfast industrially grate because orchid prominently refuse out a sloppy betty. cuddly, guiltless detail
Will you share the map after you finish or gonna sell it bro?
Mojang hire this man for your future updates
Man its cool! You crazy <3
I want mojang to hired this guy
just me wanting this to be an ark map xD
ah yes... this is minecraft universe... building is easy... there can be huge cathedrals in small villages...
Bro upgrade woodland mansion,mineshaft
Dose this have a seed name or no?
I would love to play this survival map! Have you done interiors too???
"minor changes being made" *creates real life in minecraft*
In the snow biome u should put some abandoned cabins
is it just me or does he loki remind you of david dobrik with his outfit. lol
Don't forget to transform the other side of the portal / the nether making it more hell ish . I love your building style ❤️
The juicy plain reportedly pretend because karate perioperatively rhyme pro a rambunctious child. onerous, boorish bed
I saw some of your builds on Tik Tok. Keep up the good work!
Can you make a custom cave and mine shaft
Suggestion: waterfalls are so cool on custom made maps. It would be a really cool addition and you can add a secret cave behind the waterfall that is hidden with water, grasd and vines.
That's insane. I'm speechless. DAMN.
Mojang should make the world generation like this 😯
Suggestion: you can make some taverns in the towns where player can sleep in upper level and get food and trade in the ground level.
how o dowload
A dwarven village in the mountains or mines with lots of redstone builds
0:00 amongus
A thing i whould love for the mushroom biome is an underground area that kind of resemble black reach from skyrim
new minecraft battle royal map confirmed
Ohh men! THATS AMAZING!!!!!
Why ulr download?
How do I download this map?
i beg for this to be a modpack or something cause omg it looks great
Where we can find the download? Will you release it?
no lava world?
@6:35 funny how the flag pointing into the wind (according to the clouds)
a crashed spaceship would be epic
Hahaha!!! 80k likes? more like 565k likes in 5 days!!!!!!!! :O
So cool, if you could create your own game i would like to play it, dude that mapping and design of other infrastructure and even the landscape is so perfect and honestly it really caught my eyes.
Im loving that he asks for 80k likes and when i look theres more than half a MILLION 👀
Yo trixy I think you really should make an oasis like the one in assasins creed origins maybe..
In the era of Clickbait, This guy made the masterpiece and earned a bunch respects. Hats off
I would love to play this map
It's a bit sussy doe
“Just a slight transformation”
Completed?
Man im so impressed
This is insame
can you make this world for download publicly and not on your patreon please i can't afford your patreon i beg you
imagine the best survival minecraft world but then you go into the nether to see the vannila generation 😐😐😐
If minecraft was naturally like this, I 100% would play it. It currently feels directionless and without a purpose but you are making it worth exploring and playing through
Now the caves are missing.
I'm not trying to be rude but why does his eyes look kinda off at the begging of the vid
If Minecraft actually just naturally spawned like this I would actually play it.
You gonna have an underground build like a mineshaft or bunker? Mob kingdom?
Will there be quests? Because I could see some villagers giving quests to help you get around the map and see the different builds, and uncover the lore.
Making that awesome house it will took 4 hours for me 😭
I play it yes we do it
Build an arena there
Pls make downloadabel. Sorry my englsih. I'm hungarian. Your project is awsome. I'm subscribed.
Trixy,may i ask what you used to create the world/edit? I would be very thankful if you told me❤️
This map needs to be used in an rpg game.
I will take day to make this                     ..... HOUSE....
Where do I get the map
Please upload The map so people can download it its so cool
if its only on java can you please do bedrock as well with it
Talk about skills of trxyblox like literally that's the coolest thing I've ever seen ❤
4:56 the moment he mentioned breath of the wild (which is my favourite game of all time) I immediately wanted to like the video until I realised I already liked it lmao
How we download the map

Where will it be uploaded to download? :)
Please part 2
what a big minecraft world , if there is world download in minecraft pe
Now we just need someone to mod this and make it randomly generate
Nice
You should do a part 2 where you do the nether
It would be sick if villagers would actually live in the custom structures
Where is part 2?
Epic.
80k likes, easy
i would really love to play in this map.....but can we play this map in singleplayer???
I watch this when I wanna go sleep idk why the music and your voice is like a documentary
Imagine if mojang actually made the update like this, fortnite players would've played Minecraft instead of fortnite.
@TrixyBlox will you give us the oportunity to explore this world on our own?
add a kingdom
how you created this world pls site link
80K you ask? 562K, take it or leave it!
In one of the trees. Hide a chest underneath it filled with good loot like a stack of iron, diamond armour with enchantings on it or smth, maybe a crossbow and sword. And finally a golden apple
MOJANG! MICROSOFT! WHOEVER! hire this man dangit!
Where can a download the map and is it free?
Maybe you could include like Castle and destroyed castles maybe also like castles but with pillagers and maybe include battlefields so like places with destroyed houses catapults and dirt and mud and maybe battlefields where still is fighting on going between pillagers and humans
Wanokuni
Honestly this is so amazing I don’t know what to say. Keep up the great work and I might come back to this channel, first time watching and this seems like a blast to experience this and watch.

DUDE this guys better than my other guy i now have a new minecrafter to watch and its gooooodddd
at the start i thought this was an ad...
u can put chest with loot around the map? And maybe ores in the ground?  Idea for the map: a bunker, a yeti cave in the snow and maybe giant footsteps of a giant.
Can I get this map for pocket edition and for java edition ?..... Please reply ......
He should be added to hermit craft
This feel absolutely amazing...  I'm so exited to play when this comes out

500k likes 5M views
Brilliant map bro keeping up

Whan the map is sus!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!? 1??1?1?1?1?!!!!
This is basically Minecraft Impact
Please let the app
minecraft but make it genshin impact or zelda breath of the wild
I'm so hyped and excited to play in this map!!!  Also, I suggest to add animal groups scattered around, either for realistic wild life or for player resources, considering that villager in plain don't eat meet.
Imagine this being an actual mmorpg map. ❤❤
If this man made skyrim mods they would be top of the list straight away
I got an idea please Add Atlantic the lost City
This is why we need mmorpg minecraft
Who’s tryna team up and create a survival team for this world?
add freezed Napoleon to the winter biome

guy. you might as well just make the entirety of Runescape or Middle Earth
let me know when he finishes it
It is goooooooooooooood
Pls for android
Mata nui from bionicle. Lol jk looks fucking beautiful man
What if you try to survive in this world?
I want the map download of this
It would be awesome if you made this a sever
Hi, this project looks amazing! My only concern is that, since the world Is so big, the biomes themselves might feel a bit empty and repetetive.Could you add in more naturaly generated structures like ravines, birch Forests and small hills in the planes and simillar stuff? Another small village could by nice too. The world could feel more alive
Cool keep up that nice making
Omg i like your vid all of your vid
Them villagers will be happy
IDEAS: -Secret structure hidden under unstable sand in the desert -A coral biome resembling the Great Barrier Reef around the coasts of the map -waterfall of sorts  -sinkhole -cave paintings/carvings depicting the wither or ender dragon  -crystal caverns   -natural sandstone arches
I subscribed based on this video alone. I definitely gotta watch more videos! I love how artistic the farms looked. I’m always building thing so straight lol. It looks soooo good!
how about, adding some MrCrayfish's redstone builds scattered around (just choose what fits the most/best. I don't know this thought came into me when I saw that you reconstructed the huts....) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2FC870D708AECBBA
do moreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Wowwwwwww
where can i download it man ?
Imagine speed runners speed running this
What about swamps?
I just rlly hope that the nether will be upgrade too xd
Villagers: HAPPY
Salute to the cameraman too for recording this masterpiece
will this be compatible with the cave update? usually, me and my friends start a new world whenever a new update hits and this would be so awesome
Can't wait to play in this world
on 2mil upgrading the whole nether and on 5mil uupdrading the whole end and on 10mil upgrading the entire universe
add a Predator to a jungle xd
proper sick
this is extremely cool keep going and hoping for the next part
Man it must be a big compliment "you build like a villager" in this map
You should do something for Hephaestus he's the god of the fordge in Greek mythology he was a giant son of hera he was the one who fordged Pandora's box since Pandora was his and his ex the goddess of sexual desire( I think) and after the box was found he was cast to the under world With lord Hades where he for the rest of eternity spends time trying to recreate his daughter Pandora.  He's quite the magnificent specimen in Greek mythology however I can not say all the things his story has to share for they are um well just look up his and Athenas story and see for yourself.
How long did that take you?
Mojang: write that down WRITE THAT DOWN!!
Hey man could I recommend instead of the barriers for waterfalls to use structure voids @TrixyBlox
I cannot wait to explore this it looks sooooo awesome
Here’s an idea   A giant hole somewhere in the jungle with a waterfall going down into a lake in the hole which is a giant underground cavern something like ark aberration with ruins and ancient structures which could be an upgraded stronghold with the end portal and use the new glow vine thing (forgot name) which is coming in the new update as a light source as well as the mushroom lights you can find in the nether (also forgot name) and traps
I need a part 2 right now
Bh free to
For one of the cold biomes could you add a central to Himalayan style monestary high up in the mountains
this is nothing but minecraft update in next 5yrs
Make possible to play in bedrock edition too!
beetroot be like :- No one cares for me mojang pls remove me all the farms jeloueses me pls !
upgrading? more like roasting mojang and making them look bad at building
The tree are not "survival friendly" as you have say bc some of the tree contains slabs and fences and are reall hard to chop down .i hope you can read this and fix it
Imagine speed running this map
Yo man what happened to your eye bro?
The video is over 80,000
Please get this to bedrock console, this would so cool to play there
you should make a map pack with the map  but with out it .it still looks amazing
To be honest the oak pilleger outpust feels like home
Excited for part 2, please bring it!
can you make a map like genshin impact world.
I really like so I will sub because I just feel bad if you did all that for nothin:')
How can we play this maps!!!!!!
A doom reference
Tricky what about lava and water obsidian building. I will get to the nether in like 50 seconds nice. Also why not make redstone traps
why dont you put a cave in the snowy mountain where the yeti lived and then have some dialouge from the diary entries in the other biomes about how they killled it and make it sad
You should make it where you can't just mine diamonds, you have to find them in like labyrinths or like dungeons
Zootopia in minecraft
amogus
Make a animal zoo thingy but make 40 because there's house things you no so make it into a zoo a 200 meter animal zoo
I love it😍, I hope u ll focus on nether too 🙃
_PC Heating up noises._
Wow Iike A Farm Land 🌄🍃🌾
I see people doing builds like this and wish I could build this good
Can you create the zelda map?
Custom npc companions in each area and random encounters.
I have no words ... just speechless 😱😱
Can you convert this to bedrock as well?
In the snowy biome you should make a skii hill with the lifts!
Ok I AM HOOKED AND SUBSCRIBED CANT WAIT TO SEE MORE...but may I add a suggestion...maybe you should build a castle or somthing like that in the world and also I think you forgot the swamp biome but I’m not sure
Make a nether and end to explore too
bro  that looks cool how did u maked it?
Wow So Beautiful Island🌳🌱🌿🍀🍃🌄
I hope this is a success and I’m excited to see where this goes
This is SOOO cool! One suggestion is to make the staircase up to the ruined portal a little more beat up and "destroyed" otherwise, SOO AWSOME!!
pleease download link
Beautifully simplistic. Brings out the true potential of Minecraft. Even brought a tear to my eye.
Where is download button -_-
After this overworld biome could you please do The End and the Nether biomes and also custom End portal room etc.
This video make me subscribe to your channel
This is 1000% better than the dream smp
I hope mojang will watch this video , and started to make Minecraft world same like your world ideas . This minecraft world is more OP then the original game and its more easier for any player to play
I WANT TO DOWNLOAD THIS MAP          BUT I HAVE PE                I THINK IT WILL WORK TOO
WHY IS THERE A DISLIKE
Sus
This is going to make you so even more famous ....
can build the whole castle of the indian film bahubali
Imagine this world   being a seed
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍wow just wow
I have one suggestion/question, are you going to be making custom cave systems? And also are you going to be making large caves and lake caves like the kind that will be in the new update, I’ve never a map making mod so I don’t know if it makes caves for you, bug if it doesn’t I don’t know how a survival world would work without caves to mine in.
Imagine if Yogscast played on this map...
Please finish this, I’m not even capable of playing this world when it’s done but the 15 minutes went by way too fast and this world sounds perfect
Can I give a suggestion?  Asian themed wheat farms, like a slope which each farm on a round part of the slope
Insane map... I look forward to play this map with my friends.
dude just amagine playing this with your friends
the like goal was 80k, and in 5 days it hit 559k
How about, you build one really big special tree. I know it's really vague but i just wanted to say it.
Really interested in this, don’t know why you are redesigning the regular Minecraft trees, but the rest is exciting
add a custom mineshaft also great fan of yours keep it up
this is litterally one of my favorite Minecraft youtube videos now, I love this idea so much and I cant wait to see it finished!
this looks amazing cant wait to see the next video
here to remember I was here from the begining
I want an Iceland Temple that look so epic
mojang would be proud
This is amazing man it’s like your taking on the huge challenge that every Minecraft builders ultimate dream is. And it is satisfying seeing a pro embark on it. Thanks you take your time don’t let the views rush anything
Damn I wanna download it now
Welcome to the land of Wano!
This so magnificent!
How do I play the map?
Dude I totally want to play this for my channel!
Bro download link please
These videos are the answer to what minecraft could be if Mojang wanted to put some effort into the game.
Very nice. You've got a ton of talent. What's your shader ?
I'm speechless. All I can say is wow. Just wow.
I really think u need an Diamond medal
Wow where can we download it when its done??

You should’ve added a cross on the church and a execution thingy
I wanna play this!!!!
How many more jaws are you planning to drop???
Get this man an Oscar.
I always wanted to make a world like this but each boom on separate islands with bridges connecting each one. Love to see fellow builder bring their amazing ideas to light.
Ooh i get it the people from the dark oak biome bought a potion from the cleric and they turn into zombie's!
This is like rlcraft but no dragons and cool weapons
Wait is it going to be in market place
where's the black smith?
Get this video to 80,000 likes, over 500k likes

Sheeeeeeeeshhhhh
I can’t wait to buy this and play it for my self
Imagine like a bigger pillager outpost that acts like its base thats like 5x bigger or something  Maybe even bigger...
Wow! Looks so really special
Please Give Download Link
Next Dream vs 10 hunter in ultimate survival world
You should probably add some lava pools if you haven’t already🙂
Pls add a mansion in every single village in every single biome .with mystery treasure....😀
I cant even to begin to imagine how much time and effort it takes to complete even 1/4th of this
I wonder what software he uses to make this big map
this.. is.. CRAZY!!
There should be a large volcano and maybe add somthing to the lore involving different tribes such as the water tribe lava or fire and plants
make a battle royal out of this
Can you make it a playable server this would be fun to play on
I so much want to help with this… But I guess outside help will only be trouble for you.
Op
TrixyBlox: "If you give 80k likes I will finish every biome"  Viewers: "No I dont think I will."   *gives more than 6 times that amount of likes instead*
@TrixyBlox can I get it on bedrock edition?
There is a Map Editor?!
Help us all!!!! Work for Mojang!!
How can i dowload this world?
You deserve a subscription
Well on mooshroom biom!
Please make more of these videos😁😁😃
I really cant wait to play this world once you finish this
I'll admit I'm even impressed and I got a compound that goes over nearly all the world I made and I saw a village next to a boarder but in the end do you plan on making videos of all the biom villages and other structures?
I can't wait to play this
Will it be in Minecraft pe
Microsoft when see this video:I have once again asking for your support to make minecraft more great
where i can get the map download link? (pleaseee??!!)       Where don't have money to join membership in patreon :(
TY TY TY THANKS I LIKED AND SUBSCRIBED :)
TY TY TY THANKS I LIKED AND SUBSCRIBED :)
TY TY TY THANKS I LIKED AND SUBSCRIBED :)
TY TY TY THANKS I LIKED AND SUBSCRIBED :)
It would be great to see the tower he made for the ender portal, or even just re-use many of the buildings (like jungle temple or desert temple)
Im watching this before sleeping and its so calming seeing all the greenery and all the transformation while wondering how your so good at making roofs
Make a clash of clans village
I was just wondering if you could make a little shorter video. I watching this in the morning but I can’t watch the whole video because I don’t have time. So like a   15 minute-video
Can you do the nether
This is amazing, keep it up
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dude I would pay to play in a world like that
Speechless wish mojang added thit
Can you also make it available for iPhone
Sus form
Imagine he do all that with survival 😳😳😳
reminds me of katan— i love it
Can you keep the texture pack with the world it looks so good
You only have 1.35 million subscribers!? BRUH YOUTUBE IS WACK YOU DESERVE MORE THAN THAT!
everywhere you go there is one npc who always there  a trader
so basically you are turning minecraft into botw... sick!
We can see so many wondering villager
Does the structure actually spawns the right mob? Like for the pillager outpost sill it naturally spawn pillagers?
Make a campsite in dark oak forests
Massive wheat fields are so pretty and the plains could have used one
How much time this took you?
Idea: what If you build different places of religious worship so for an example A Buddhist Temple, A mosque, Hindu Temple ...
Thr villagers:once a upon a time, there is a god named TrixyBlox and Create this world for us.
Thats absolutely incredible i love your building style and your voice is very calming too  thx for the nice video
I think you have the windmill's blade parts mixed up. The white blocks should've been used as its fabric blades or "sails". The wooden blocks should've been used as the blades' skeleton.
Bruh why is watching the villagers run on the sped up stuff so funny
WOAH TrixyBlox looks realistic
I need to get Minecraft Java
Daft Punk..? Bruh
Imagine a TrixtBlox and Grian collab. That would be AMAZING
Need this on PS5
De que te fumaste
His milion subscriber special will end up geting him to 2 milion
https://youtube.com/channel/UC4RqrY0DLL-d6YdNgqnlHqw
Man i want to download the map
Does the world have a seed to enter? I want to see it, it so very beutiful! 😊
Can this be played on phone

9:45 COMMUNISM
I never ask my dad to buy me anything game like cause my parents are anti gaming but I am definitely going to get this ...
An abandoned wizard library, with ancient text and mysterious items.
Can u make a map like this for tlauncher? Bcuz i play cracked minecraft
See this is what annoys me about the game industry. This dude did this by himself. Microsoft has billions of dollars and unlimited man power and this dude, BY HIMSELF, made better structures, FOR FREE
I hope there is a mod where saplings will grow these custom trees when playing this map
What was the thing you were that looked like Microsoft paint to build the world at the beginning? It looked so easy instead of placing block by block lol
Can we play this map on mobile too if it's released?
hypixel skyblock island but good
Op
GG
What shader pack are you using?
i built a dirt house
Absolutely Phenomenal, would love to play this with a bunch of friends someday! God Bless 🙂.
Is this a series
WHEN WILL THIS BE DONE
Mojang be like:👁👄👁
Why he look like Milly Bobby Brown
Well im deffo gonna play this map
Idk why but I've been obsessed with the idea of an underground like ancient city or world
1 million? Pffftt sir You need ten.
Haven't put much attention into Minecraft Since 2016, this makes me wanna play again
That wold look good for pixelmon
Wew
I want to play in this World:P
Hey a suggestion is death mountain from botw
Immaculate. You are impressive, sir. Absolute respect to your dedication hard work and skill, I couldnt do it. Makes me happy to see where you've gotten and think where you'll get.
Plis villerger give golem okey
Do a small secret underground legend of Zelda themed temple
Plz. Don't put it on you're patrion plz. Jive it to us for free
I want to play this map so badly
Just say the ultimate creative mode Jk
Mojang like this video (I think)
Trixy blox for hermit craft season 8?????
wow, amazing project, i don't know I would love like a hidden abandoned bunker in the snowy mountains biomes(you know Russian project vibes), and a great idea that you probably already thought about it, like a village with a Great Wall around it and a tiny castle on the center or smth(didn't finished the video. you made smth similar anyways it would be nice like different nations and major cities), i don't know , anyways these are just some ideas I would love to see, anyways keep it up, hope you can fulfill this project
wow...just-😎 for that i will give u a sub and nof bell and thumbs up too
Bro can you add this map to bedrock?
We gave you 80k+ likes so... Whare link
This map with a storytelling mod like origins would be really cool to see
I’d love to see you do to the meter on the other side of the ruined portal
Así tengo las espectativas de como se verá hytale xd
um plz when your done can yoh put a download link FOR ANDROID USERS plz cuz not all is a pc user
Honestly, it'd be insane if this was actually in the actual game
Suggestion: There should be some kind of shrine on the middle of the island.
Bruh am I the only one who thinks the thumbnail looks like an among us character??!!
please do Russian subtitles, more people will watch your channel, you are great 👍🏻
A book with the lyrics to Rick Astley’s never gonna give u up
Cant wait for this to be finished!
will you make a mod that makes your custom trees respawn as the natural trees?
looks like skyrim kinda
where is world download and is there is oanother part
IDEA: making a crashed halo ship in the spruce forest/jungle would be pretty sick i feel
Can you please give Link to the shadder in which you are playing
Make dessert fortress
You are an amazing part of the Minecraft community, keep doing what you are doing
I think its good to have a giant tree hehehe just an idea
Hey man why don't you try building a ruined castle for the wither? Plz reply to my comment I'll really appreciate it.
this looks straight out of Lord of the rings
I think with right mods, The map  would feel like a real rpg game
Can we use the map for streaming like finding the hidden in the maps and if we are allowed to stream using your map do we need to tag your channel? I really like the map you make
And the most complex thing I’ve ever built is a oak plank box💀😭
dummies, you dummies
Amazing bro
I like the pillager tower
You should recreate middle earth from lord of the rings
Omg that's cool! Ill try to play it when it's done!
I would suggest adding a town hall or a capital building in the village
Does anyone else get Hunger Games: Catching Fire vibes when they look at the layout of this map
you could add a swamp biome and a swamp village
2 questions 1: Are you going to do anything with the Nether or keep it the same because I think a change to some of the buildings would be cool 2: Also a villain similarly described by all the villages that just suddenly disappeared would be an interesting idea just suggestions things I think would be cool
Minecraft DND?
Me: I'D LOVE TO PLAY THIS WHEN IT'S DONE! My pc: AHAHAH HAHAH hah . . .
Yt algorithim did u right nice
this is just making me want to play minecraft
Well I was gonna ask for the download but honestly, my computer would probably explode
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
Where download map?
Woodland mansion
volcanoes!!
Iluminati
Maybe you can make the portal to the end like a ruin to enter it you have to go under water and you have a monster guarding it with lava surrounding it.
I would love this but is this on bedrock
You complete 80k like 💓
Lava lake?
Where will this map be featured, and  I wouldn't mind some mods attitude like texture mods added to it to give it a more realistic medieval times look if you could do it. I really like where this build custom map is going. I have high hopes.
Can we download it please
Imagine what i can do within 1month to this world
Lol he wants 80,000 likes... We are well over half a million
The things is can you get the map in bedrock?
hey trixy, this is an awesome project! but i was wondering, if you plant an oak tree sapling, will it grow into the custom model of the oak tree or the vanilla model?
That map is pretty SUS
Please do this Please... And let us buy and play it
will mining be doable
If I can play on a PS3 then I will
I think a big keep/ dungeon built into the mountains would be cool
Temple of time tiny???? xd
Lmao i wish this was posted 7 days later so it would be on my birthday :P
80k likes...EZ
Bruh he said 80k likes not half a million 🤣🤣
Its like fin and jake, there`s like 6 biome
Dang this map already looks so amazing!!  I'd love to see if their will be a floating island or abandoned redstone contraptions once this whole map is done!!
CANT BELIEVE u built this urself. and not to mention the awesome and detailed vid. tysm
wow
How, When & Where can I play this...???
ur insane. rlly. mojang rlly should hire u. rn.
crazyyy
When are you going to release it? I can't wait to play the map it's so detailed
Wished you added a giant old stone,obsidian and iron made robo that you can go in to get loot like xenoblade chronicles robot
How to download nthis world
I want to add something in the tribal villages which you will do. I am suggesting you'd add a sun monument and secret rooms and traps and some structures from the Inca and the Bryzantine empires.
Your insane
WOW 👏👏👏👏
I’m liking commenting and subscribing just because of my sheer respect for you and this built I can’t commit to a Minecraft build to save my life... QvQ
Maybe the train could fall off the tracks
Why doesn't Mojang hire this guy already??
I just don’t understand how people like you are so creative and come up with this stuff in the moment
Just a random idea for the mooshroom island is to add a lot a big flowers I think it would look pretty and the backstory cud be mooshroom flowers started to grow on the island tell me if you like the idea
It was Marvelous
This was pretty noice
Keep going
Bro, make a pirate cave, like the one in pirates of the Caribbean dead men tell no tales
You should’ve put a graveyard beside or near the church
he is the king of building
I need a McPe download file
This is beyond incredible
Dayum
Ok can this man join hermitcraft in season 8 like holy crap
I WANNA SEE A DRUG LORD IN THE MUSHROOM PLACE
dude no one can hate ur builds, you are very talented and your builds leave me speechless
I’m looking forward to download it
Jesus died for your sins! Repent!
Imagine speedrunning on this map holy shit
IT JUST GOT RECOMMENDED
You need to have a pillaged village
The able bee naively frame because word customarily extend in a flat connection. purple, gigantic turn
If it’s not already going to be a secret you could do a bonus under ground, nether or fully submerged city build for players to explore once they have progressed, accumulated gear and or gained the ability to make potions (water breathing, fire resistance or night vision) to explore those areas.
Guys this guy does so much work, pls support him. Btw im not his other acc
This looks like RL craft but in vanilla Minecraft
I hate mobile legends bang bang
This is just amazing.
I need this map
Pls link the download the world   Sorry my inglish is bad
We need a playable version of this asap ;~;
Can we play this in ps4
You should make a clash of clans in  minecraft build
Idea : add floating islands
the thumbnail: amogus
We need this on ps4/5
Am i the only 1 that thinks that Mojang needs to hire you as builder in mc like wow
Make mode for the viewers plese
You are awesome
Why hello grian's son
Vinland saga vibes
Ok, just one question. Will it be available on console?
Wow! This is awesome, you should add a lake with a huge coral reef fit with caves in one of the biomes! I think it would also work outside in the deep water off the island too, as a little surprise :)
Can you do a floating sky island? Or something like that  Or a nether biome
if your going to upgrade the desert temple, put a mummy coffin with loot inside
i like your hardworking sir
Sick video and I am exited to see what comes next!
This feels like a completely different game but still Minecraft at the same time
Where is world download
When I was about... maybe 10 or 12 years old, I’d build stuff like this.  Sure it wasn’t as grand of as professional as this but I enjoyed it.  I’d make up my own lore for these “Builds” usually very similar to TLOZ OOT.  But I’d never really expand beyond the first village, so to see something like this makes 10/12 year old me squeal with joy.
I'd love to see some kind of cave and ocean stuff
The map will be more amazing if you can add some custom mobs or change the look of mobs
holy fuck
He should add something like the lover’s tunnel from avatar
Looks Like Australia
So, uh, it be at almost 550k... Can't wait for more and the world download!!
It would be so cool to add a couple floating islands! I think they look really good when they generate on their own and I can imagine how great you would make it
The red april dolly book because cake surgically drown times a cultured silica. sick, nervous organ
I also doesn't have that good house as the villagers house
I like it!I really really like it,the design and everything
How long do you build this😱😱😱
Make a wano theme
Damn your a good builder
Don't forget mineshafts
this is the coolest god damn thing
Make a ocean monument maybe along with a specialized nether if you can that way if you activate the ruined portal it will lead you to maybe a fortress that you revamped
This is crazy. Badass. Hope this becomes a map. 10 out of 10.
I’m gonna be so sad if this doesn’t become a downloadable map uploaded to console edition :(
Can I play it for free
Mojang has to hire you
It’s been 5 days, so I doubt you see these.  But, maybe add a tomb, with an impenetrable red stone lock, opened by key code.  Travelers have to find clues to the key code randomly throughout the map, and you can take the creative liberty in making it easy or hard to finding certain keys.   Of course, inside the locked tomb would be immaculate treasure.
You should have a dungeon that's in ruins with tons of adventure logs, skulls, traps and a fully lit end portal room that you unlock after you find 30 keys that are scattered in all the different biomes structures and the dungeon it's self
MINECRAFT'S RPG
please give the link betrock / mcpe version, pliss
You should add a pipe in the mushroom biome.  (Like so he can see this)
This is absolutely breathtaking it’s beautiful, I wish I could build something of this scale and magnitude
Your teeth are yellow, you never brushed your teeth?
This would be amazing for a roleplay of some kind.
Can you actually make like floating islands in the end dimensions , that may represent some biomes , cause I want some inspiration to build in my survival world , but I'm terrible at building (more of a redstone guy myself) but I would love to build a epic islands in the end dimension , pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
You should add a buried wild west town in the desert area kinda like the buried map from black ops 2 zombies
This is my first time watching your videos but I think this map is gonna be great! You just earned a new subscriber
Looks like mata nui from bionicle
Wow if I played this map i dont need to make house :villager:¿¿¿¿`~~
when’s part two coming out?
Make a mod that switches everything to these would be sick
How about, at the highest point on the map, you make a rickroll?
and i thought i was good at building...
Put a secret base in the snowy mountains
rdr2 minecraft edition
Hello! Its so cool, are u gonna upgrade the igloos into elsa’s castle?
With the clerics being traveling magical item salesman now, in the one of the villages (or possibly its own location) there should be a guild hall for them. Where they train new clerics, and create more items to sell.
I think you should create or add a mod that included special items to each biome and things like accessories other weapons would be cool
Please team up with some minecraft modders and make this beauty have an actual story etc. it would be amaaaaazing
I can’t believe how big this map is he is an amazing builder and I now look up to him
question, the map can be downloaded and if you can also download it on pc pe bedrock?
A hidden superfortress?
Someone needs to host an SMP on this world
Man, these villages are almost too good to burn down.  ..    _equips flint & steel_  *..Almost..*
this is sooooo beautiful
Is this minecraft 2?
Do you want to build Minecraft 2??
I smiled greatly when he went odd the temple of time and used Botw as an inspiration. Amazing job
This is gonna be awesome bro. I cannot wait!
Broo you should work at mojang your project is amazing
I want to live in the fishermen’s hous

Program?????
Wow
THIS NEEDS TO BE PUT IN THE GAME
Duude you ate genius you should tell mojang to remastered a new minecraft game cause broo this is amazing
I think Mojang should hire you
I wish I could play it in bedrock
Yep I’m definitely gonna stay updated with this. This looks absolutely amazing
Imagen minecraft looks like that
idea: how about adding multiple journal entries in the mushroom biome about a man who woke up there and starts to slowly go insane, because everything is mushrooms
I dint skip both ads to help you with your hands :>
Can u tell mojang to upgrade the house pillage trees and broken portal
I think it would be cool if you also transform a part of the nether and the end with a nether castle and the nether king and the end king being rivals with the dragon being the end kings pet idk if that is to far from vanilla either way I think that would be cool and maybe possibly a troll that owns the overworld and the reason that the portals of the worlds are destroyed(ruined portals) is because there was a war and he destroyed them to keep the nether out and also explains why the end portal eyes are token from the portal and keep even be hidden in the dessert temple and other world structures
Villagers: yaaaayyyyy we have a new house we will defend
I’m watching this everyday to keep it fresh in my mind
how do you download on xbox?
He said 80,000 likes, we blow it out of the water with 547k ( to be continued ) 🤣
Where is the world download
bro how 😭 i wouldve given up on the first structure
This is soooo cool
Vim pelo jazzghost salveee
The Gospel: We sin against God and for our sins we deserve hell. We fall short of God’s perfect standard for heaven. But the good news is we have a way to be forgiven, that way is through Jesus. Because he loved the world, he came, lived a sinless life then died on the cross for our sins, paying the price which is death. He was buried and rose again on the third day. Through Jesus we can be forgiven of our sins. If we put our faith in him we will be saved ✝️❤️
ONLY 80.000 LIKES!?!
Including an igloo would be really cool
wow (speechless)
when next part???
I just want it for survival, make the stronghold and ores underground
This is by far the most impressive thing I’ve ever seen done on Minecraft
Luke skywalker getting saved by Obi-Wan Kenobi in the tundra
You know what would be dope the temple of time with a super powerful diamond enchanted sword the lookes like the master sword
what? what!?
Lol 80,000 likes..... hahaha blowing that waaaaaayyyy out of the water
Build a snow village
This is eye candy... great job! The pillager outpost reminds me of a barbarian outpost from Civ lol
I usually never subscribe to someone after one video, but today is your lucky day.
Have you ever thought of building your own city/town?
I think you should add a gradian from Zelda that would be a great lil secret and plus I want to see how it would look with your talent
Dude catan looking cool
Can you import this map to bedrock?
Make desert biome has your Giant Black Pyramid
Bust up those nether portal stairs, they look way to new compared to the portal
Legend.
M A N T A P
After it is done and we are able to play on it can I make a YouTube series about it
I’m mostly focused on the clouds lol
I dont know if this was already planned but you should add large ore deposits like coal and diamond in veins upwards of 10 underground in the snow area
you should add like custom stuff like mobs blocks and more
Why u look like u live in ur moms basement aka “man cave”
Imagine just hopping into vanilla minecraft one day and stumbling upon this in your world.
7:20 no sé porque me hace recordar a Horizon Zero Dawn
você vai liberar  a semente para o mapa????(translate for portuguese)

Will it be available on ps4?
OMG i love this map, so epic
23 mil comentários e vc achou o meu parabéns
Could this please be ported over to the Bedrock Edition too (when it's done)? I'd love to check it out.  Edit: If you do port it to Bedrock Edition, I'd recommend uploading it to MCPEDL.com, that's where most Bedrock players get their maps and mods.
Hoth easter egg in snow area
hello me oliver wood
put a book that says: bruh pog
Wait Botw- Hey thats cool!
I pray this world will be in bedrock edition as well as java
i dont want to break those beautiful trees
Imagine this on max graphics
I have a suggestion what if you put  ship wreck in every biome 😁 made from different kind of wood
Dude this looks awesome
Me struggles to build a wood box Trixy I built a new minecraft and it is better then the old one Me whaaaaaaaaaaaaat
Me:Loads map  MY COMPUTER:CRASH .............
9:00 sussy balls
So... Where seed?
Maybe a huge shipwreck in the ocean, OR a ship graveyard underwater

What about making a kingdom in every biom and the mushroom biom has the enchanted tree
Love the videos
I can’t wait for the map
Man, i hate you. Right when i was starting to believe that im a “good builder” I see this
Whitening toothpaste....
00:00 Father: Amestris is looking good, son
Think they got you past the 80k like goal
Jesus Christ, this is just... This is just awesome.
God recreating the world
If only there was going to be a bedrock version
Shait, minecraft need a land generation update
You should collab with a mob maker to make these structures and biomes work in random seeds
Mojang taking notes right now
Hey quick question if you finish can I use the structures for a mod?
desert hype.
can i play this?
Will this be available on mcpe?
Thx for the inspiration my dude!
Is there going to be a p.2
Mojang and Microsoft wants to know your exactly location        -Accpet.     -Accpet.
Kinda hype for the wild West biom.
make a strip club
My idea: the strong hold must be in a cave
This is a 4000×4000 blocks Minecraft world that cost $100000000.First to survive this island wins $300,000 Mr Beast be like
How about some igloos and volcanos, a dungeon with Zombie villegers,Castle pillars or Kindoms?,hidden Treasure maps that lead to Good loot,and Those dark woodlen mansions would look cool
wheres the link for the download?
So Bionicle?
YOU SHOULD INCLUDE PIRATES!!!
im excited to see how this goes first time i actually subbed and used the bell from watching just 1 vid lol
Link to download?
100 days in this mega island you build
Waiting for dream to have a manhunt in this godly map.
You have earned my sub
for another video, why not the Games Of Throne map ?
What no smite
We need this I hope you get done
Anyone else getting "Hunger Games" Vibes from the design?
Absolutely amazing transforming
This is what a Minecraft building tutorial is like
can you put some tutorials for some of those revamped villager houses?
M A K E  A N O T H E R  O R  E L S E
They should just update villages to become more complex like this and more professions, there are probably mods, but great idea
This is so cool! I just subscribed because you make your videos so interesting and the builds you do are amazing!
Will this map be free because if not I ain’t playing it
Great job.   Here is my suggestion for a side quest/ story line.  If you have some sort of royalty in this world you could have a Nobel villain that has been defeated in social edict and is banished to a far off corner of the map. If you read there diary you would find out that she was engaged to the prince but didn't want to marry him because she loved a cute peasant girl. So she acted like a vile bully type to get un-engaged. This backfired somewhat when she was banished from court, but she could still choose where to be banished to. So she chose the home of her love. But tragedy strikes when the prince, who came to gloat in her defeat, meets the young lady and falls in love at first sight with her.   That's the basic premise but you can write the thoughts, and feelings of the characters and what because of them. As well as events that happen before during and after the storyline.   Just remember to reward the player with an item at the end for following the quest. But that's only my suggestion.
here's an idea what if after finishing the biomes you do a custom end and nether for this as well
you already reached 500,000 likes
this is probably the biggest minecraft project I've seen since like 2013 when megabuilds were super popular. I'm really looking forward to seeing where the hell this goes. It's gonna be a lot, mostly for your ram, but jesus if you put this much effort into every biome... high hopes.
is it just me or did he forget the blacksmith?
Dang if it only the download was free this is a sick survival map
Soy el comentario en Español .  .  .  .  .  Me gusta si no entendiste ni el 50% de lo que dijo pero si entendiste el video ❤️😂
what if he made the world of Ravka in minecraft, including the Fold, well... i might just die
Microsoft should learn how to make good default maps like you
Realizes that you didn't hit record
Wait are you going to do a swamp??
Can I download this on ps4? I feel dumb asking but I haven't played minecraft since the ps3 days, way before we even had sea kelp. Just wondering what's possible for me since this inspired me to go back to the craft
I'm not sure if you're taking suggestions or not, but I might as well throw this out there-- I think it would be cool if you had a system of small roads or paths between different villages, and have those pass through areas with pillager outposts-- it'd be a neat touch to help sell the fact that they're bandits, as silly as wanting realism in minecraft is.  Also, do you have any plans for a woodland mansion? Just curious.
I cannot wait to play this
jesus fuck your video card is carrying this shit on its back
You could make a house or village full of hiden traps
Bro. You are so talented, I could never do this.
I know this is a lot to ask but you need to post this faster
Question, will this be on both Bedrock and Java?
Can't wait to play the map when its done, I can't even begin to imagine the secrets you will put in!
Omg this crazy wat the hell this dude has insane skills and motivation 🤣
i cant wait for it to finish
I can’t wait to play this on singleplayer but i also want someone with good wifi to make this into an smp
What about the other bioms?
Upgraded Custom Map [NO]  The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Mod [YES]  ( Also I can't wait to play this, 100% my new main world. )
can you make a pillager or monster camp (reference of zelda)
Perfect
U should get 40 people for each biome and they all go to war w eachother for more land
Microsoft should hire u to get in there game design team fr
You are so talented to the point this should be like the design for the actual game buildings
I'm assuming that you can only play if you have a pc?
You should  make this world available on Bedrock edition and for PlayStation, that would be amazing!
It looks beautiful but I think the stone Mason was to close to the main town with a quarry it should be a bit on the outer reaches kinda like the windmil
Pessoas que veio pelo jazzghot
This is dope bro
I have an idea for the mushroom boim since it doesn't have any structures you can make the mushrooms houses :)   (I rly love this   thing I also signed keep up the work your amazing)
Wow this is such an awesome project, really good building and soothing voice, kind of reminds me of Sjin back in the day when he was building things like crown conquest.
How long did this take you? Cause like my guy you just made a whole city from a village
Alright I’ll ask...   How many GB is this gonna be?
He's playing God, and I love it.
Will we be able to download this on bedrock?
So this would b my first time downloading something so if anyone could help 😊 also If it costs money then that might b a problem
Make it a smp
THIS IS CRAZY! I HAVENT PLAYED MINECRAFT IN YEARS AND I AN SO EXCITED TO PLAY THIS!
Sick build! but don't forget the ice biome too!
I hope part two is coming soon!
Looks like Wano Country
This man is creating a whole new video game campaign....
We are on 540k likes where is the next part
the thumbnail looking kinda sussy
Dude absolutely destroyed the 80k like goal lmao
"Get this video to 80,000 likes and I will post the world downlaod." 5 days later: 541K likes
Make sure you have all the ores in the world.
This guy's teeth scream British
that library was  not minor
What if he gave out a copy of the world not the one he’s working on but a complete copy for people to build and then give him a look of the world however he prefers (idk if this is possible btw)
I love the Zelda Remix when u show the Plains Village
You forgot natural lava lakes!!
80k likes? huh, to easy for us
Cant wait to see the next upgrades you ll do🤩🥰
where's the download?
Hunger games map lol
Men I dont imagine if I play a build battle game with you .__.
This guy would be perfect to join Hermitcraft in season 8
you should custom make your nether
omg this is so so incredible! major genshin impact vibes haha
Speechless
There should be a waterfall with something behind it like a secret palace or something in one of the mountainous biomes.
One word Respect
Squeak
u should make a coliseum in one of your areas
Ultimate... survival? Bud in the game I play we'd call that a "paradise planet" get gud homie
I thought that was a Fortnite world lol
wait so this survival world has lore?
are you able to edit the nether? since the nether has its own biomes too, you could make a kind of lava island centered on where the ruined portal would show up with and upgraded nether fortress and piglin bastion.
This looks like Voya Nui from Bionicle
imagine making this in survival
this is absolutely incredible holy shit
Vim pelo jazz ghost
Can ya make a link for the map?
Crashed plane, like a old 1930’s twin engine
Man's making a whole ass game in minecraft
Am I the only one that sees among us in the thumbnail?
Is there a stronghold?
In 5 days he got 35 thousand suds
He did better than the creators of Minecraft
Wanted to do the same thing, (my own map to play) but just had some fun in the map editor, my own trees. That was pretty much it, but the scale and creativity you did it is just amazing. Love all the ideas. Definitely going to play your map. Cheers man
This is just amazing I would love to play it
A giant underground cave town would be really cool if you can add that
You should make it available on bedrock edition, a lot of people dont have access to hava
I love how he says 80k likes and he gets 500k and 4.4m views 😭😭😭 I really want to play this though
Wait the towers were churches? always thought they were watch towers
How the chruch is smol i cant even make a good house
I'm looking forward exploring it in vr ^^
It would be nice if you put some Easter eggs.
I think you should make the gigantic nether portal similar to the doors of death from Greek mythology
I love the feeling and the story of this project so much. I don't even have Minecraft but I might buy it just to play this map.
Part 2 pls dude you must hurry and when you do make sure to include those texture packs pls bro keep up the good work😀
IDEA: You should include a reference to Red Dead Redemption by recreating "Beechers Hope" near the wild west town!
You should put that underwater kingdom in the ocean.
God this dude so much better at building then me T~T
Bro Minecraft should hire this dude to make structures
Cant wait for the world download love the vid :)
The fabled god of building has been born
If you play this in ray tracing it’s practically an open world game
Nice Design.
Bro you need to brush your teeth or if you can't be bothered to do that move the can away I can smell your fucking breath from here
Please create a Persian biom
Desert. Mesa. Savanna. Taiga. Snowy Mountains. Dark Wood Forests. Jungle. Plains. Mushroom. Long ago the nine biomes lived together in harmony, then everything changed when the Desert biome attacked! Only a Minecraftian, master of all nine biomes could stop them, but when Minecraft needed him most - he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I have discovered the new Minecraftian, a master of the Plains biome named Steve and although his Plains biome skills were great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Steve can save Minecraft!
Bro That picture at 15:00 is just so satisfying
From the moment the video started I instantly found his voice awesome
It's really pretty... but hurts me a little with the stone pulverizer in the middle of the town... where everyone gets to hear the constant crashing...
Wait so this is only going to be on Java dam in on bedrock :(
..........wtf is that???
Can I get this on bedrock?
Fucking hell man...
Speak normally
Graveyard please
download mods on there with custom animals, lighting, etc and give the world more life
This looks amazing!! Will PS4 players be able to play this map?
hope to see this build finished and available in the future
That’s sick
Also can we download for bedrock?
Suggestion - Create a great bridge to mushroom island! Players could use it as a really cool player hub (cause ya’know no mobs in mushroom biome)
Anyone else getting botw vibes from this?
Do you plan on adding in any modded animals? Because I think it’d be really cool to add the variety and larger animals in!
Ngl this reminds me of lego set MOCs
Can we play it on console?
Vim pelo Jhazzgost kkkk mais alguém?
you are an amazing human, you omega chad
How can people dislike this vid ???
Oi Trixy, I would love to see something done with the nether and all the biome in it perhaps something like what you did in you bastion video idk just something to consider.
Get this Video to 80000 Likes... Community: Hold my beer
Imagine the time you need to build this without using worldedit... Incredible...
i wanna play this map so bad
Fucking hell this is beautiful
Oh I did just hit the sub button
You deserve a like man the effort you put in this, blew my mind
Dude I’m so getting me and my friends to play this
Minecraft
I stopped playing minecraft a couple years now but I'm definitely coming back for this keep it up bro
he made a sick ass looking everything for the plains biome...    i'm waiting to see what tf this guy is going to do for the ocean monument
2.3k dislikes why..
4000×4000 isnt 16.000🤣
Imagine how detailed minecraft will be if he owned the game
And where s the download
The map reminds me of The Hunger Games
Can i have the map ??
*sees all the details and trees* my CPU: *intense sweating*
he said 80 k not 537 k likes idiots
You should make a mod(or ask someone) for this map
I wish I had this for Wii U🥺
so. how so dedicated?
Holy jesus
He has no eyelashes or wassup?
A train through the map
Holy fuck
this is cool, also if 1.17 drops will u add amethyst geodes?
This looks very familiar...oh right
So excited to be able to download this in the future and explore. Keep it up!
How and where can i download this map? I wanna play it 😥!!!
What is the name of the texture pack????
You should add the scene with Luke on hoth in the cave with the Wampa.
I. WANT. TO. PLAY. IT
You should build the wall from game of thrones!
“Can I get 80,000 likes?”  Gets nearly 600,000 likes.   “Mission failed, successfully”
I clicked on this video because it looked like a Catan game.
Wow wow
that's amazing! cant wait for more
What if every structure this person has upgraded was how Minecraft structures actually looked. I promise you there would be a lot more people playing if this is how it looked instead
I like it🤗
could i play it on bedrock when it’s done? i don’t have a computer sadly.
imagine have all of this in vanilla!
Oh my goodness, this is so stunning! I'm literally going to be annoying all my friends by sending this video to them repeatedly lol
wtf
HOLY SHITTT
The amount of work put into this makes me feel tired just watching o-O I absolutely love this idea
Minecraft needs to hire this man. I just can’t believe to see all of this was just build by 1 single talented man!
🇧🇷❤️
Yoooo is it posible that we will be able to dawnload this world but with no changes just like simple map that we wpuld be able to experiment on oir own and maybe you could do some give away for the best wold desines or something like that. Btw im new here so i hope u actualy read the coments and feed back from them xddd if u have read this pls give a shout out to DannyS
Looking forward to playing this when it’s done
*bugs*
You should get a modder to make all the special villager professions functional, and have special items!!
Can I get this map?
Amazing!!!
It feel so nostalgic just imagining playing on this world with some friends
When will mojang hire you?
THIS IS AMAZING
Are you going to do anything with the nether?
but also it would be pretty coor to do aa rebuild of a nether fortress so if you do light the ruined portal it's not just vanilla mc on the other side
Will you port this to Bedrock when it’s finished? It’s really cool!
How did you make a custom map
Wolfs yes
The tacky eggplant contemporaneously surprise because dahlia lilly charge underneath a annoying discussion. ahead, happy lipstick
Qm veio pelo jazz?
holy shit dude you should 100% make this a datapack or some shit
The medical goose remarkably wrestle because glider conspicuously wave anenst a mature biplane. cheap, mushy land
Will you make this a mod in minecraft?
Pause at 13:33 and look at the beauty of it
How do u download the world
Dude i swear i could watch these videos all day! Just sucks that i have to wait to see another transformation XD
<3
is it just me or does the logo at 1:16 look like paradise pd's logo? no, anyone, ok.
Someone pls tell me why mojang didn't think of this🤔
Could u make this for Bedrock. I would like it to use for my PS4
Nice job,man.For a game with so much potential the Vanilla game is so boring and plain,the developers are really lazy,I don't think it's so hard to do what modders and builders are doing.What a shame,thanks for making the game so much better.
Darn it lol i was secretly hoping this was a 3 years old so i could see the whole serie But I'll stick with your serie i defo wanna see more!
You should team up with Jeracraft to make an amazing build
It would be very entertaining if you made videos for the other biomes as well😃👍🏻
MOREEEEEEE
Mojhang should hire this guy
I'm so excited for this! Once it's done it's gonna be so fun to play in, well done so far, you're incredibly talented
are you going to do this type of thing in the nether?
Muito bom Mano parabéns pelo seu trabalho
:)
When I first looked at this I thought man was making the Fortnite map 🤡
It is so nice .  Can you put the map in copy to try finish Minecraft on this map.
Will it be available for bedrock
The creativity. Wow

I love the pillagers outpost
Bro the Map aint 16.000 but (4000)**2 = 16.000.000 blocks
This is just amazing. You are the best builder i've ever seen in minecraft
is there gonna be a bedrock version too? or is it just Java
this is just absolutely tremendously beautiful
Put a jeager hanger from the ppdc under the island with 1 Yeager
Very cool idea
damn bro this is so sick, keep up the great work!
Add some rogulelike dungeons
I thought our project was big
You are an cheater
Damn.. now imagine someone adding mods here and turning it into an RPG or something..
I play Botw
you should make the ice/snow biom a viking theme
This looks like wano from above
Quem veio aqui pelo jazzghost kkk?
Really impressive, but the "towers" you made on the church are in a gothic style, whereas the rest of the church is in a roman style, I don't know if it was wanted, but it does looks good anyway!
You should recreate one of the hermits starter bases from hermitcraft season 7  (since their full bases are already basically mega bases [especially Grian’s/ especially can you do his or Mumbo hobbit holes])
This looks amazing
hate to be a bother, but where can i find the world downloads
Can you put a link for the map
Where’s the next build
When this is done, I’m am 100% streaming a play through of it
As a Minecraft player that played this game for almost 10 years, I can't even begin to imagine myself building something this amazing, I can't wait to see what will you build in the next biomes.
You are absolutly INCREDIBLE!!
WOW I need to play this!
would love to see a igloo and a wandering trader camp
Can ypu tranfomers stampys world please
Insane.
TrixyBlox: if we get it to 80,000 likes then....  Me: thats all i needed to hear, also its got 530,000.\
Why you gotta make us feel like garbage builders
Do more small builds. I like yours a lot.
Can we Play/Download it?
Firstly, great job! And, il there be any port? Or a ship at the coast with cannons and treasures? Its just awesome what you can do
Wait *ONE PIECE WANO KUNI* !!!!   :00000
Could this provide for a viable survival experience?  Caves, natural ores at their expected y levels etc
When will you finish the map? I can't wait to start to play at the map
CANT wait until we can download the map
Yes please make the Bob Ross reference!
i can respect the bob ross nod
-
Can you make pirate ships in the oceans and put villagers it them and fill them with tresure?
When it's done, it NEEDS to be an official map, it's simply amazing!
Plains will be *SIMPLE*
How do you have the patience to do this 😅 I would quit after redoing one structure
gives me genshin impact vibes
Mojang u better hire this guy  He’s literally a god in building, he would make minecraft 10000% cooler even tho I really like it like it is right now
Mojang take notes
Is this map going to be free..?  I hope so
Trixy: the church is kind of small. me:WAIT WHAT THATS BETTER AND BIGGER THEN ANY OF MY BUILDS🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
You should build some animal farms that are isolated from the other villages so that it isn’t just Greenland (or whatever biome your in) that you can see
I will play this
imagine surviving 100 days in this world  HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
His face: •_-
Make a rpg server with this map
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD I WATCHED 5 MINUTES OF THIS AND THIS IS SOO GOOD OMG GOOD JOB THIS GREAT I LOVE THIS
Is this available on PS4 anytime soon?
Wow this looks insane I can't wait to play it
A air temple that can only be accesed with elytra
Make a secret bunker whit loot inside and as a home to a other secret player thats unknown Add it like in a snow mountain
"Once upon a time, [name of the island] was divided in 7 parts, each of them having their appropriate people : elves in the forest, dwarves and yetis sharing the mountains, dry plains inhabited by [earth savanna's animals], dragons and griffins occupied the mesa, plains housing humans/villagers. The desert had few inhabitants, only were creatures and all types of snakes, while the little island south of plains were home to monsters of the night, such as vampires or trolls.  There were many disputes in [name of the island], the perfect exemple being elves and dwarfs. Ennemies beyond time, they didn't even remembered why ! The island monster, too, were not pleased about there tiny home. By the time, dwarfs and elves fought, weakening themselves, and the monsters made plans to extend there territory.  In the meantime, the human, a weak people, grew stronger by their technologies, and their number increased. But one of their king, more ambitious, wanted more. He pitted the peoples against the others and encouraged open wars in the desert and in the forest/mountain. His goal was to conquer the elvish forest and part of the dwarvish mountains. When those people were enough weakened by fights, he invaded their lands with new war machines and tactics. Seing this stronger ennemie, the dwarfs retreated into an underground kingdom, and the elves used their magic to go underwater to rebuild their home.  While this was happening, the greatest part of the mesa inhabitants fleed to find another land, far from the evil human, and other joined elves or dwarfs. The savanna's animals tried to resist, but where crushed by the king's army. Some desert snakes who were able to live underwater went with the elves.  Yet the greedy king didn't had achieved his dream of domination. He allied with the night's monster, which happened to be a bad move. When he provided them boats to go to the desert, they backstabbed him (literally), but didn't killed him, they did worse : they turned him and his men into illagers, who now live at the plains coast, watching the island where came all their trouble."  Well, I hope you enjoyed it, fell free, if you want, to take this story, even the least part, as the backstory of your island. :) (PS : exuse me for the bad english, actually I am french!) (PPS : you're really AWESOME ! )
wash your mouth dude
Reminds me of drehmal
I have only watched 7 minutes and 31 seconds of this video and I NEED to play on this map (when it is finished).
Will you add stronghold And new end?
Who feels he wants to watch this for a hour.
I love these videos they must take ages to make I respect it thanks for making my day when you upload.Keep up the great work man 😍
"80k likes" *gets 530k*
can you add a moon
This looks so amazing, I can’t wait to see the finished product. I think it would be really cool if you moved the woodland mansion to the snowy mountains and transformed it to look like The Overlook Hotel from The Shining.
Are you ever planning on releasing this map
I would say to add ruins of a once great empire that ruled the whole world but then something happened that caused the empire to collapse... scatter ruins all over the map
Will I be able to play this on console when it’s done
Can we maybe just have the map without structures ? Just to play with friends and create our own survival structures etc ... ^^ But anyway, wow amazing project !!
Thoughts of Skyrim...
Reupload the video with only the background music.
Why does this really make me wanna go play minecraft😅
You are good
Wheres.. the world...
What are your BSL shaders settings?
Can you share this map ? 🥺
Microsoft should have a building style update and freaking use your or buildings
Where the fuck i download this?  <3
i rlly dont like this guy i regret clicking on this youtuber
Me whats the point in building a house when you can take one thats looks good
Pllssssss add a spider nest
A ore mine and mansion
You should make this a mod and call it,  Upgraded Structures and Biomes, or something like that. It would be really good for sharing your builds and creativity.
Oh well, I need to see the rest, gonna have to subscribe now
I wonder what grains reaction would be lol
What about an underground city? Like the one shown in the beginning of the video. But this one is submerged in water and in a giant cave. Except its abandoned and in ruins. As if its the old world, and the new world was built on top of it
You should do a lion king reference for the Savannah!!!
PLEASE BUILD ONE GIANT KINGDOM
Why dose the pillaged out post look like some thing from Skyrim?
Kinda looks like a map for fortnite lol also why not build an abandoned city their
A swap biome would be a nice addition
this makes me sad and happy to play minecraft - im never going to be this good. but i can try
Mama basically made a fortnite map
0:00 its impressive because hes wrong In a good way i mean  If it really is 4000 x 4000, then its not spanning over 16,000 blocks  Its spanning over 16,000,000 blocks
This man should be a Minecraft developer!  Edit : Thanks for the likes!
This will be LIT. Just could you make also  for pocket edition
How long did this take omg
You forgot the swamp 😥
This man made Skyrim in Minecraft like wtf
"small scale" subbed; show me what you got
This looks amazing and super cool!!! I'm so excited to see what you'll do next. I have some ideas you, or anyone can use if you find them interesting and if they fit with the lore and world you have planned:  -A witch in a forest biome living in a huge tree, or a village inside and coming out of a huge tree. Maybe oak or something with lots of mushrooms and secrets inside ;) -Secret chambers in desert temples or jungle temples with cool items, but with loads of traps on the way there >:D -A ranch and farm for leatherworkers and cows!!! (pigs and sheep too lol). -Maybe have an order of artisans living somewhere that makes weapons and stuff (armorer, weapon smith, tool smith etc.). -An oasis village in the desert (saw this in another comment and thought it would be sick). -An overgrown lighthouse on a cliff or abandoned village near the ocean monument (also saw this in another comment and loved it). -A village with houses in the sides of hills! Hobbit style. -I'm not sure if you can control what happens in the nether but maybe a village for piglins in crimson forests and abandoned villages with hints in journals to the location of a mysterious fortress with a massive lava waterfall (your take on a nether fortress would be badass). -For more nether stuff, maybe giant bone spikes or beast skulls / scattered huge bones in the soulsand valley. Skeleton villages? -Nether quarts / gold mine next to an abandoned hut??? -A hidden abandoned village that either leads to a treacherous path underground to the end fortress, or the path is in that village. -Maybe a cavern underground where the end fortress is, surrounded by a lava lake and a rickety bridge (with lots of mobs inside). -Same thing with the nether, I'm not sure if you can change what happens there and how it spawns, but maybe change up the plain obsidian pillars (thinking like Barad-Dur from LOTR, the tower which has the eye of Sauron on it in Mordor). -A forest mansion somewhere! I feel like your take on one would be amazing!!! -Maybe change up monster spawners if you plan on using them, the plain square rooms looks sorta boring to be honest.  I know this is a lot, and I had loads more ideas, but those are some of my favourites so I'm just throwing them out there! You don't gotta use em, but if you or anyone in the comments takes inspiration from these I'm glad :D Feel free to repost any of these ideas, respond with any coo, details to these ideas or keep the list going! So excited to see the upcoming progress on your world man. You're like a superhuman fr. Keep up the outstanding work!!!
This guy is a LEGEND
I'd never thought I'd say this but you are better then Grian by FAR.
This is amazing. Can’t wait to try it out!
Ok I changed my mind your the best builder I've ever seen.
Make a lumberjack hut and a sawmill in the plains village
i wish i wasnt scared to get addons onto my worlds ;(  then i could do stuff like this
Bro please give us a download linkkkkk
pog
what about the nether????
wow, the amount of time this must have taken you, also I love your Minecraft builds because they have a great aesthetic that flows together very well. I love your videos because it makes me look forward to playing in creative Minecraft mode and build endless things! Also, I hope you have a great day!!
when do you plan on releasing this map I'm so excited
When will it be done?
This is something I absolutely can't wait to see finished
Add a interesting story and rpg mod and you have achieved greatness.
Structure update when?
I will play this the second it comes out if I can. I can't wait dude.
4000 x 4000 = 16000000 and = not 16000, its 16000000 or 16000 m^2
That is insane I cant wait to play on that map
Like a Age of Empires, awesome
Pc players when they find out their world is pre-built
This deserves more than just 80k likes
LOVE THIS can't wait to download it when it's done. Question, will there be naturally spawned ores?
hey it’s over 80,000 likes
trixyblox: TB tuberculosis: TB
In the plains biome you should make a little hidden shire
Make an underground stronghold for the survival
Okay but did anyone else get mad when he started replacing the trees because you realize you'll have to break every single block of wood so you have no floating leaves
Hi Trixy when you release this I want to use it as a minecraft let's play is there going yo be loot to find and everything like that
Could you please add a world download?
Make a swamp and make the mushroom island bigger also that giant black desert temple would be good for the desert and adding NPC mobs from edu edition would add a nice aspect to the story telling you have been talking about and add quests it would also be nice if you had not just those main structures like the villages and outposts but also little structures like old abandoned houses and little graveyards where undead mobs would spawn and add all the new cave bioms at a large scale and adding to the other dimensions like the nether or end and add custom mobs like zombies with netherite armour thats just an example and add characters that you can revisit over your journey make a challenging adventure maybe with redstone puzzles and powerful mini bosses add structures that are massive and feel lile a maze at times and instead of one shipwreck make it a ship graveyard with lots of drowned and some powerful drowned with better wepons and armour and add an underwater ruind underwater city made up of all the different ruins make momments that make you afraid   all just recommendations to help you out all because i feel this has a lot of potental and i have faith in this project keep up the good work 👍
Please let us play this world it would be soooo awesome!
Do you think we will be able to download this world? I’d love to play on this
How much. Time time did this take you?
Says 80,000 likes and world download will go into the description... Has over 500,000 likes, but no world download.. XD
Can u do tutorials of the stuff u build specially the farm build I love it
In the plains village, I think it would be a good idea to add a stable for horses and the villagers tamed them. Since horses are mostly populated in plains areas across the world irl and Minecraft.
What is your PC my guy if I went in this my PC would actually explode it’s really not that good of a computer
soooo, when are we getting building lessons?
huh 80k like goal? *rookie numbers*
0:19 why did you use this symbol of masonnery?
Hi! I suggest that you make a massive ravine that goes thru two or multiple different bioms. Hope you see this comment!❤️👍

5:00 right before you said breath of the wild i was like wtf look like botw XD
The caring hell architecturally stop because wave intriguingly repeat atop a possible pizza. agreeable, hard dimple
So it's technically some kind of series?
Please, Please, PLEASE, if it is even possible, make this accessible for bedrock edition, Even if it means buying it from the Minecoin Shop it doesn’t matter to me I NEED this map in bedrock If you can, all of us bedrock players would really appreciate it.
The map is awsome !!!When you will transform the other bioms?
Skyrim references. Secretly upgrade the nether world as well

WOW
Hello everyone,  I love our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, with all my heart and I want to tell you about him. We are all sinners who have come short of the glory of God. God cannot allow a single sin into Heaven because he is a Holy God. The punishment for sin is Hell, and we are all sinners. God does not want anyone to go to Hell. God loves us so much that he sent his only begotten son to die for our sins. His son, Jesus Christ, took on all of sin when he died on the cross for us. Jesus Christ’s blood washes away all of our sins. Believe in your heart that God raised Jesus Christ from the dead on the third day. This gift of salvation and eternal life is a free gift of God. By the grace of God, we are saved by faith alone, not of ourselves or our works.   None of us know when we will die. Accepting Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior and getting saved allows us to have this gift of eternal life in Heaven. Repent. Put your faith in what Jesus Christ did on the cross to save you. Trust in Jesus Christ to save you. Believe in, trust, and have faith in the Gospel, the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  If you are sincere about this, say a prayer to God about it!  A couple of resources:   Check out "How to Get Saved" and "The Gospel" by Robert Breaker on YouTube, and check out "How to Get Saved and Be a REAL Bible-Believer" by Gene Kim (REAL Bible Believers) on YouTube.    Some verses from the King James Version Bible:  Romans 3:23  23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;    2 Corinthians 7:10  10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.    1 Corinthians 15:1-4  15 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;  2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.  3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;  4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:    Romans 10:9-10  9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.   Acts 16:30-31  30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.   Ephesians 2:8-9  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:  9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.   Please let me know if this message has helped lead you to Jesus Christ and your salvation. Thank you for your time.
This build was so beautiful that it made 2k ppl miss the like button

This might just be the coolest minecraft map to ever be made. I really appreciate how your storytelling combines with your fantastic building! It's a real piece of art man. I can practically see the people living here. Looking forward to how the world progresses!
But wow yo so talented and those trees in plains masterpiece
does anyone know what program he uses in the beginning to create the terrain? u recognize it from other vids on yt and have been searching for it
You should maybe transform the end and the nether. Just a suggestion
where si the download linkkkkk
This is amazing
*aggressively bang credit card on table* I WANNA PLAY THIS SO BAAAD YOU'RE SO TALENTED OMG 😩
Can you transform the endcity
WAIT WAIT WAIT, MAKE A BROKEN CASTLE THAT HAS THE SAME MOBS AS A WOODLAND MANSION AND THAT HAS GOOD LOOT, MAYBE THERE COULD EVEN BE A ZOMBIE BOSS WITH NETHERITE ARMOR. PLEASSEEEEEEEEEEE ADD THIS OR AT LEAST TAKE REFERENCE FROM THIS😭  Edit: like if you want him to see this and do it

I would like to see a japanese village.  Maybe in the mountains. Would be cool.
The shaggy aftershave angiographically alert because antarctica arguably smile out a impartial opera. terrific, handsomely lycra
2.2k dislikes?? how??
mojang should hire you
Stunning.
Fun Fact:- You are not watching this video in full screen 🤠😁
Me :- I want to play this Minecraft. My Pc :- Don't think of it, it's just a imagination, forget that you had ever seen this before 😎 Me :- 🤐
When the map is sus...

i absolutely need to see more building on this world it is insanely beautiful and makes it feel so warm and comforting of a world to be in cant wait to play on it
nether and end
Imagine if grian and trixy did a build together
This is absolutely stunning! I love the way you completely transformed the village into such a beautiful build I want to see the full product so bad
Maybe you could team up with Mr.Crayfish for a collab, so he could mod in maybe a villager guard who could get his own outpost.  Or maybe make some actual ships or make the travelling villager the travelling merchant you were talking about, with a cart and all
basically minecraft2 ?
You could make the mushroom biome hollow... Just an idea
Where download
They should just take all of these structured and biome designs and plug it in to there infinite world generator
Are you going to do a custom nether to?
Pro TIP to Making Something : Use Shaders
What is this shader called? And can I get it on Minecraft PE?
.
Just wow.
We need to have the rest of the transformation
i would play the map even without structures. i love huge biomes
Him:i ask for only 80  like          500 k take it or leave it.
When you finished do the same thing in the nether
Hopefully, Hytale moddability allows for world generation to become as deep and good-looking as this (or at least come closer to this) !
What is the shaders u r using in the vid???
HURRY UP I NEED THIS
How can i get the world?
World Download??
Cool
Look like bionicle map 😁but i like it
Brooo...This is super cool!!!! Pt. II when?
this map is kinda sus
We should get this to 1.000.000 likes minimum
Hey this video got to 500k likes then where and when will you sent the link to download the map
This guys should be hired for skyblock map making
you should build battle grian
If you want the plains biome to replicate the feeling of breath of the wild you should add a tent and a campfire under one of the bigger rocks.
This is what Minecraft 2 looks like
That pillaged base is insane
I cannot wait to play this when it’s done it’s going to be so fun
Im willing to pay for this
Cmon make the next one know 🙁
Mojang...!   MOJANG. ...!!!!😤 Hire this guy      Plz..😅😅😅
i feel like it would be cool if the pillage towers are like mini dongeon with some loot and some treasure at the top
where can we download when u finish
Im planning on joining your patreon. Me and a few of my friends seem interested in the map. Am i allowed to send them the link to the map when I join?
Respekt, it's Look so nice!
Hello, Please can you tell us when you are gonna put this up for download, and if you can, can you make it so bedrock players like me can play as well😁
A huge shipwrecks lots of ships on shore in the water from a fight perhaps
This would of taken me a decade to make
am I the only one who really want to play in that map?
Imagine a 100 days on that map
Can you download a server from somewhere
If you extend the idea of the Plains village being exclusively vegetarian and pescitarian to the players by disabling farm mobs from spawning there, it would give players incentive to explore the other biomes for better food. You could even compound on this idea by making mobs exclusive to certain biomes, like horses - plains, rabbits/wolves - mesa, etc.
This plus some cool mod=awesomeness
If you haven't skipped through any of his videos to get to the finish of the build than your a legend
asks for 80k and gets 500k 🙏

Let's try to reach 80k !   >520k likes as of rightnow
the map is mod friendly?
Since you get so inspired by botw could you put a few towers around the map which can have secrets and chests with items
this is what I wanted to do a number of years back, with an earlier version of World Paint (might have been a different software altogether, can't remember).... but my computer was begging for mercy at every turn. ended up settling with a very customized ATG map, letting it generate randomly. all of this, with proper configurations for mob spawns, custom NPCs and designer builds, could be *THE* ultimate Minecraft map. ....and why stop there, I'm sure if you make the call, lots of modders will jump on board to make a unique SMP server, now that there's chisels and decoration mods, there's no telling what they can pull out their asses.
Makes me think of a survival games thing where a zone gets closed every so often
Yo just 5 days ago you said this.
I've always wondered what it'd be like if there was some sort of civilization update... Which I'll explain. In short, the three current npc factions we have (piglins, pillagers, and villagers) would all have their own sort of kingdom in each Minecraft world. The catch? They're extremely rare. It'd be common for you to probably never find one for a long while in a few servers. But when they do spawn, they're big. And, the deeper you go into their territory, the bigger the settlements get, and the more frequent the smaller stuff appears. On the outskirts, you'll find the farms/outposts. Go deeper in, the roads will get longer, you'll see more stone stuff, you'll find villages, then you'll find towns, then finally cities. Remember, as you go deeper.  As you get progressively deeper into the territory, you'll notice that iron golems/ravagers/whatever the piglins have will start appearing more frequently. Same goes for any soldier types. The deeper in you go, the better equipped they'll be. Same thing goes for tradable goods. The towns and cities are going to have individuals that will give you eyes of ender as well as other rare materials like netherite... For a price. Either you slay stuff for them or give them lots of emeralds, who knows. And that's pretty much the rundown of it all.  Also, I want more ores and weapon types. For example: titanium and the ability to make stuff like iron arrows.      Thanks for listening to my TED talk
seems like a map of land of wano to me   XD awesome build and idea keep it up
Shoulda put the ruined portal at the center of the map in a giant oak tree
He smashed it😌
This is amazing I can’t wait for the map to come out how do you build like this I subscribed.
80k likes is not what we do
Congratulations you have now turned your notifications into a war zone
Just imagine in the future if this is what Minecraft actually looked like
Part 2 please!
How do I download this map
These are amazing! Are the interiors of the bidding fleshed out? Because of this is a survival world, it would make sense for there to be interiors too
What if you could use the railroad to get around the map, it would be pretty cool
holy fuck i don’t know what i was expecting, but you’re literally a god
Meanwhile I'm living in a dirt hut XD
Can Someone tell me the seed of this map?
You should add in a areaI something kind of magical like a witch thing or a elf home.
IM SERIOUS ! Will this be playable on ps4
HOLY CRAP
Fuck yea
Best Minecraft RPG map 🔥🔥🔥
Nice
Add a little 253 mod and Boom we got dark souls in minecraft
This is insane. I’ve been suffering burn out on my worlds as of late and this was PURE inspiration. Super excited to get ahold of the map when you’re finished!! Great job!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
This is insane and something for the dark oak forest could be like a big foot den
I think it would be cool if you would build some underground dungeons.
you should add waterfalls in the rocky parts! :)
bruh u only need 80k likes   and u got  520k likes
I’m I gonna have to pay to download this masterpiece ?🙁
I think you should add a Volcano 🌋
Perhaps add a deep undersea cavern that stretches under the entire island? Could add a whole new underground world to discover and have a small crevice to access it around the outside of the island.
you should do a datapack
Is there a download for this?
Yo nunca llegaría a construir también como el XD
Alternative title: 15 minutes and 2 seconds of proof that i never touched a woman in my life
Wooow this is so cool! can't wait to see the rest :)  Before, I didn't really like his builds. they were very much world edity. (like a temple on a hill with some china style mountains around it?). but this is just so creative. really a dream for everyone
I think you got more than 80000 likes

I’m just thinking of how dope a hermit craft season on this would be
Vanilla counter: 100000000000
Imagine a map like this that is completely based on breath of the wild
On the small round island you should put a lighthouse
Imagine how many hours this took
World designer level : over 9000 !
‘Get this to 80000 likes’… Urm congrats!
Mojang should hire you as a world designer
A tunnel network! Maybe even for it to be inter-biome!

The God Of The New World
This would be awesome to have builds like this as an option when creating a world, you could either do like normal minecraft or something crazy like this
Minecraft needs to take notes😳

In the tiger forrest they should add a large Pillager encampment where they have begun chopping down the forrest. Maybe they control a lumber mill
also add woodland mansion

Yo, this is SIIIIIIICK!!!
How are villagers vegetarians? I found raw meat in one of their chests once

How download this map?
I’m currently trying to build a cool Atlantis city in my own world but it’s driving me insane because Ive built the bottom of a HUGGEEEEE circle under the ocean but as I came to finish it I realised that it doesn’t line up. So one side isn’t symmetrical to the other. And the circles so big I can look at it all because it won’t load in. The whole things making me angry 😂
Mojang needs to hire this guy!!
Im more of a Call of Duty Player but I grew up on Minecraft and this shit has always amazed me, this dude is awesome
:0
it is cool but if its to big you may need to add a car mod or something like that
Soooo.. Gonna do the nether too? Lmao
Nether?
I think minecraft should make a story mode including these types of structures which were put with a lit of effort, and yea I love minecraft but it would be a god game if they try to add stories, magic, adventure, and especially living dragons, and a lot of things (I know it will take like 1 year but it would be very good and the best game )
Can you make this a bedrock edition map
Man...     Nice!
Alright, it's over 500k likes on this video. This is awesome.

The god of building :O
bedrock release ?
I think some dead/fallen trees is the plains would be cool too but it obviously could be in most the biomes as well
Your tactics confuse and frighten me, sir
I think a giant mushroom on the mushroom island would be pretty dope as a sort of centerpiece for the biome
I am not really  into  mine craft but I am happy YouTube recommended this to me.
Awosome😘😘😘😘😘😘
Can you send it to me, go to the friend section and type Rowlndz and there
When is he making more of it😫
Anyone else decide to not skip any ads in this guys video?
Trixy blocks: please I’m not the messiah  Everyone with a brain: he is the messiah!
The Kingdom of God is at Hand  John 3:16 King James Version 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
Someone should use this for a role play 😅
Waw 😻
HOLY SHIT MY GUY, THIS IS SO COOL. Well done. You clearly have a huge knack for building amazing structures and this whole build got me to subscribe.
I think you should include other places of worship (maybe even like a psychedelic peyote tribe. Also where was the village bell?

This literally blows my mind
"still quite small to how I usually build" oohhh I wanna see some more of these they sound so cool and this was a really cool idea and it's all beautiful!! I'm totally subscribing <3

How i download map
um i upgraded everything. only upgraded plains
Will we still find ores when me mine tho?
You are awesome!!
Using world painter is fun!
Oh, so like, skyrim remaster?
snow biome: glaciers and maybe santas house
Same bro I am so excited to play in this world
can i play it
I think you should use a mod that adds mobs and bosses. Like adding a Pharaoh at desert A mutant zombie at the infected village At The plains adding more animals. The wild west part adding skeletons with pistols At the frozen biome adding a bigfoot or something like that. And adding a small separated island that have u need to get a diving suit so you can fight a giant octopuses to save Atlantas
You need to make this a mod pack
I *will* play this when you're done
which program do you use
plsssssssss add some ice spikes!
The spiteful hurricane july chase because billboard exemplarily fit near a concerned ice. witty, acid step-aunt
I just love the Breath of the Wild references
Make a big undergound tunnel system, which links all bioms
I'm proud of u, well done.
you should go with a middle earth theme in one of these builds. I'm sure I am saying this for all the other LOTR fans out there.
Wow I'm soooooo impressed it's like you spent 1000000000 hours lol O.o
I suggest adding the ability to load new chunks, thousands of blocks away, so once we are done, we can add mods, update the version or just have the ability to find blocks we haven’t found yet in the island. I think this would add thousands of more hours of playtime, making this ideal for a vanilla smp or a different start to a modded adventure
Hopefully it's not just for his patreon otherwise i am gonna have to steal mothers credit card
I'd love if you also added chests with actuall good loot, as discovering new places is awesome bet even more so when you get some cool loot, just like a ruined portal.
My crappy computer cant hold to see how big this world and how much ram it will take :(((((((
Brooo, if you played rlcraft on this it would be siiick
Where can you download the map? This looks amazing
Yo you should try and become a builder for Wynncraft!
Maybe go for a Jumanji the next level inspired rainforest
I wish there is an advanced vr so thaf i could feel and visit your maps
Крута
with the pillager tower do they spawn naturally
I REALLY CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS! We reached the like goal so i am excited

If you have charm installed ( a mod ) it lets you have beekeeper villagers
my man is going to be an architect of his own country
Just... wow...
Add a gnome
Wow
This is awesome
give save for this plsssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Try use Rtx with that
I would love to play this world, but my PC would probably explode
how do you film yourself so cinamatic when you are building
Your creativity is skyrocket! Looking forward to your map.
You should partner with mod makers
1. How are you so good at building? 😂 2. Why can’t vanilla minecraft look this good? 😭
awesome
Please Give this world download as you said to give it at 80K likes to this video.
For the blacksmith (when you make the village he will live in), you can add a spot where iron golems are created
11:30 the voice crack ;-;

I would love to play on this map
I dare you to build mahishmati kingdom   And i know you can't
Nice yellowteeth
The best idea i could think of is to make a modern city like new york city but in complete ruins. And on the mushroom island . A hidden cave with a small stronghold with some books in it about the storyline
You have done a great job with this I liked and subscribed
Dude you’re amazing 🤩🤩
can you add a tiny pineapple underground for no absolute reason?
pp big pp
Where's the swamp if we want to do survival we're gonna need certain mobs from certain areas for example slimes they spawn deep underground in caverns but spawn more in a swamp on a full moon
This is incredible
Please can I have this map and the shader please please please please please.😭😭😭 it's so beautiful!!!
The mountains needs some kind of ice castle And the jungle an underground temple  Also add something on the ocean under the jungle  And something ou the outer ring of the map, behind each section

How do u Made this? (App)

Take a look at Persian ancient architecture. It could be inspiring for you
I think that a YouTuber should do a man hunt in this place that would be rlly cool or like a 100 days challenge
Ideas for regions norse , Greek Muslim,  Egyptian plz finish this map we belive in you your videos are great
HOW do u do that?
What if you made a jungle village in the trees with rope bridges attaching them I think that would be cool 😅

Do the Pillagers naturally spawn new their outposts?
You are the nest builder that i ever see i wish i could be like you😋
Idk if your still taking suggestions but you should put an underground village like attack on Titan
I think a golem village would be cool idk
Did you already have an QRTX 5090? And the i11 20600X?
One question, does a structure, like a pillager outpost actually spawn pillagers, i’m referring to your modified ones.
can i downland this map anywhere???
I cant wait to play it!
Dude is doing the gods work respect my guy respect
This is so sick!
This is so sick!
The Island look like a sideways Pacman

This looks sick can't wait to play it keep it up bro
Wild West town? You’ve got a new subscriber

i really want to play this map

Have you ever checked out the Minecraft Tutorial worlds? You should really try finding footage or getting 1.6 to check for yourself. Some AMAZING builds are in that tutorial world.
Yr insane bro😱

Please dont do the stereotypical desert temple thing, everyone does that.
Put a rickroll

Where can we download this map?
My only question is: will we be abble to download and use the Map when its finished? Because i wana Spawn in there and never leave
How many hours did this take?
What this programme?
You should upgrade the desert temples,shipwrecks, mineshafts, nether Foretresses, end cities, end ships, and caves!      Btw can i download it on bedrock edition??
I don't even wanna build a house in this world cus it'll stick out like a sore thumb
Holy shit! This is AWESOME!
i want to download
Can you put in a legend of Zelda reference?!
I love how you based your build off breath of the wild and you did a really good job at it too! I'm shocked at how big the build is and how much detail is in it! I'm 100% playing this map when it's finished!

I always question how people can make builds look good without making things stick to boxy proportions / grid squares.
I'm subscribing this is amazing I'm speechless
How are you gonna make things spawn?
I wont theis map.                     Dued.
I wish i can download that map
Video: ends Me: noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
this guy deserves 100 mil subs
Imagine dream playing this game that he made and the first thing he does  Is to call his freind on discord and make an awsome speedrun vid on this map, And title the vid "4 Hunters Vs Speedrunner Remastered"
All I did was smile, open mouthed at what you created. I've been playing Minecraft from the very beginning and you Sir are incredible. Wonderful imagination and skill, put together and explained with perfection. God bless and thanks for sharing!!
It looks like an arena from the hunger games. The only thing missing is the cornucopia.
How do you download this on ps4
Well done, that is one of the best videos I have seen in a long, long time. 👍
He did what we’ve all always wanted to do
This is amazing I wish I could play it but sadly I'm on ps
80k may have been too low a like goal 😂
It's so cool! But quick question, will it be available for pocket edition?
This is truely amazing 😱🤩
Can you add floating islands
How do I get this map to play?
9:04
Why does this remind me of those build tutorials that be like "This is only going to take like 20 minutes to build" and then starts a time-lapse.
How do we get the map or is it too early to download it?
i think the ruined portal would look rreaallyy cooler than it alrady is by putting some nether blue and red trees and grass
look like island wano (one piece)
The fact that anyone can make something so incredible is mind-blowing to me
Didn’t you say you would do it in survival?
Do we have to pay for this map???
And then image some A-holes going around destroying stuffs
Mojang needs to hire this man ASAP
mojang should hire you to make maps for the market place fr
Microsoft you should be writing this down
Mojang need to learn from you !😁
Bedrock Edition Players:                  Why are we still here... just to *suffer*
Where playable map?
You should add a main storyline  By that I mean to create a thing that nudges you in the right way liek you get spawned in plains and you find sowm hints to go to the taiga then In taiga to messa and so on.  You get what I'm trying to say
I would be very happy if you build a mesa kingdom !!!
respect bro!
No I really want a PC
This is so absolutely great. Wow.
WHERE CAN I PLAY THIS MASTERPIECE???????
I wold like u to make a rick ashly refrenses
Map plz
this is amazing
It's official, I suck at Minecraft.
Can you make your own world on Xbox?
create a secound island for rpg games, so you could "change enviroment"
I’m most excited to see a fully fleshed out story for this world that would be discoverable in the open-world setting. I’d recommend that the story be built around the existing Minecraft conventions of the structures, the nether and the end to keep with the vanilla survival theme, but give us a story as to why the player has to defeat the ender dragon. Make it a LotR style adventure; An epic quest to save the world from the evil ender dragon! (Complete with plenty of lore of course)
When he said 80,000 likes for a download... and its at 504k likes hahahaha
them poor horses carrying them big wagons ;(
Make the map available so we can play on it!
Why does this guy's face look fake!?!?
Lol 500k aimes en duex demain. Tu vuex 80k
Can you pls put this in mc bedrock
MORE
I cant wait to play this i didnt even finish this but the idea itself deserves a sub and a like I hope u take ur time and finish it soon
Subbing becuase you made my childhood bust💦🥵
bro says 80000 likes, dab em up with the half mil
Dude, this is honestly stunning. I’d never have the patience to do all of this in one setting. Mojang needs to hire you as a builder.
MORE
Ha ha 80,000 he says
This gave me good advice for building thanks
Absolutely can't wait for part 2!
I can't even tell you how excited I am for this 😊
Mojang must use this
When you are down just think of me :some may think I'm crazy others think I'm free
Is it me that feels the vibe of lord of the rings on this map or its just the map?
Minor changes = Proceeds to renovate the whole thing 😂😂😂
where i can download ?
That bro just shall ask mojang to recreate village and redesingn building perfectly like fe did
You deserve 10,000,000mil subscribers
How did you create the biomes, like, how did you make it so that pillagers spawn at the outpost, and Guardians at the monument?
I am absoluetly willing to play it when you finish.
umm
Imagine if Minecraft added creator mode where people can be in your Minecraft world and they can survive there  I would want to go here
thank the lord for world edit
Will this work for the mobile version of Minecraft too?
havent watched it all but can you ad like in the middle of the whole map( or anywhere else) a end portal and yeah teraform the end idk
Add custom igloo with maze
0:15 ''survival friendly''   *me with my 64695 gold block I grief in the temple* : it fine
To be honest the first second i hit the like button cus the title
TrixyBlox: Let's get 80k likes for download of world! Youtube: Here's 500k!
Iam speechless 😶

I can't wait to play on this map D: This looks awesome!!
Ur shades look amazing 👏
If you are going to make a story via books, put a 1/x, (1/150, 35/150) to know what book is first o to know how many the are
Wow... I want to play that map!!!
are you redoing parts of the nether and the end? it looks amazing
So is this going to be working on each biome in their own video?
I like my cereal like my minecraft: epic and playable
This should be vanilla minecraft
dude ur using minecraft like roblox studio
You can clearly see how much you were inspired by Breath of the wild but this makes it all the more amazing. Catching the Vibe of just standing in the middle of a plains biom and listening to the birds while viewing the landscape is just amazing and something no other game has done like breath of the wild. I'm looking forward to getting back this feeling while playing your map and waiting for botw2. The size of your Map may also work around the problem that you'll entirely know the Map of breath of the wild after playing like 200h.   Lots of love and Thx for these videos <3
do a custom mob and bosses to map
Mojang taking notes 📝
This is UnderRated should have atleast 4Mill likes
So you know how you are going to make tons of jungle tribes can you make one that worships E
What beast disliked this?
If I ever use this I wont wanna destroy anything because of how beautiful it is.
It could be cool if we had quests and collectable items
HOLY SHIT 500k likes with 4 million views. That’s actually insane
this is so great <3 the spruce roofs gave me the idea of "trade routes" between biome villages... could be a great piece of lore that the Taiga villagers trade wood for veggies or fishes...
DAYUMMMMM i wanna live in a villager outpost
Mate you deserve 500million subs
Wow I am speechless
Vim pelo jazzghost
bro real mincraft gotta be like this
make a god fight if u want
I can't imagine my eyes That vedio blowed up so quickly in 4 days I really admire your building skills and your creativity and I can't wait for the download of this map thanks
i love this i’m excited for the other biomes
You could build a hobbit town
Just saying but you need to brush your teeth more often
This is awesome holy shit! Can't wait for part 2! And can't wait to play this game myself!!
This shall be the minecraft world looks
You dummying
Se imagina una serie de Karmaland en este mapa edo sería increíble no?
l feel like the first custom trees(three of them) would be your camp and where u spawn at with only a bed a chest, torches al around the chest and your spawn point will look like a ruin(if u know what l mean)
This gives me the vibe of the show "West World" .
sehr papatastisch
Make the villagers with high IQ and they can use all you did and more things like what we do in real life
id love to see someone do a play this map with friends!!
Can you upgrade the end world plz
Not sure why I was recommended this video considering I don’t watch Minecraft content,  but your commentary and editing style captivated me enough to stick all the way through. This was a fun video, I’m looking forward to seeing what you do with the rest of the island.
This is probably the coolest video i have ever watched
I CANT WAIT TO DOWNLOAD THIS!!
This is Minecraft 2.0
Make a huge mushroom in the center of the mooshrom biome! (And hide something in it ;) )
why don't you upgrade the forge ?
Along with the biomes, you could maybe upgrade the nether and the end as well, since it seems only fitting for such an epic world to have incredible new dimensions as well.
A big waterfall would be nice
can the ps4 users use this map?
this map would be soooo fun to play with scape and run parasite mod
1:29 when the world is sus!
papaplatte zuschauer was here
This is what I love about minecraft. You can be as creative as you can be and there is literally no limit because mods can help with something vanilla doesn't have.  Just like the minecraft trailer said "only your imagination will stop you" or something
TURN YOUR WORK INTO THE DATA OACK , SO WE CAN PLAY IT , AND WE WILL BE APPREACIATE IT❤️❤️❤️
amazing
Maybe you can make it so each biome is a seprate tribe
I want to play your world is so cool
I am in aw... this is amazing dude!!!
I know this is gonna sound kinda weird but I’m a huge fallout nerd if you could add a fallout Easter egg would be awesome
Mojang should have contacted this guy before making Minecraft Lol
Bro you are creative af😁
😁💪🏻❤️
How do I play this world!??????
If making maps please do a lot
Wow...
80k fuck you, your getting half a mil and there nothing you can do about it
Love the video though!
Now i want to see badlands because this is my favorite biom :P
This man does Mojangs job better than mojang does
I cant wait to play in this map
An underground cavern all around the world.
Dude, few days and 500k likes and 1.3m subs!?
I did the math, and 16 million blocks is 16,000 kilometers. To put that to scale, thats 40% of the Earth's distance if you walked all the way around.
When he built the church the first thing I thought about was how cool it would look to walk in there for the first time with RTX
Pls do Luke the notable transformation
NICE REPLAY MOD XD
I would definitely play on this map
I'm wondering how much time you took 🖐😵
Caramba eu dou palmas pra você
Can i have the download link of it
Put a giant anchant stone brick maze in the ocean next to the masa

You only have a million subs??? You should have more with how incredible your builds are and this massive project only being done by you and your partner! Hats off to you! Like, Subscribed, and Shared! :)

Watch Couriway speedrun this
He's the type of guy to offer you the whole bag of chips
OMG🤯😍!!! SO NICE AND BIG PROJEKT!!! WOW!!!
O-O.... just O-O
Damn must agree it is insane
This is insane
Me imagining the crew of Tommy Innit, Ranboo, Dream, "Gogy", Wilbur and more all on this map--imagine all the lore and wars that would happen. XD   ANYWAY--this is great mate! I love it. I can't wait to download this.
Nice, this would be nice as an updates Legend of Notch mod
Epic
I doubt you’ll see this, but have you thought about making this world 100% able to beat the game while only in Adventure Mode? Hiding Diamonds in certain areas as one of the main ways to get them, hiding certain enchantment books in areas, ect.  Would make a very fun playthrough, as well as being a completely different experience for a very unique world.
SUS
This video is just wow 🤯😳
he forgot the swamp biome
11:50 approx. Those Horses have been chillin there for a while 😂
this reminds me of red dead 2 it's amazing mate well done
@Mojang wyd?
Been waiting on this 1
This is so cool just there is just one thing that I’m worried about that being the size of the map, it’s just so big that I feel like there will be a lot of walking you should add some kind of fast travel
Love this you don't understand
That's sick it's Look like zelda breath of the wild. edit. oh you say breath of the wild
Don't forget to put iron golem in the village
how do you get in this survival mode?
Is there any way to download this?
O my god u really use ur best talent keep idol 🤩
N’aww, I had the same idea but it was 25k x 25k fully custom. Guess people are going to just say I copied Trixy now ;(
He asked for 80k likes let's give him 800k likes
I can't express how impressed i am wow- great work looking forward to play it!
I've  got an idea for the mooshroom island. It could be the back of a giant sea creature e.g. Turtle, squid
You a king of mincraft’
16mil blocks....I really want to play this map off that alone
Hey how do I download this map ?
for a moment I thought it was the map of fortnite xd
Will it be free to download
What’s the seed
I'd love to see Shrek's swamp
This is absolutely epic, when release?
You are probably the best builder I have ever seen and this is only the plain biome I can't imagine what you will do with the other biome's
Add ice castle in the top of snowy mountains
You know what? You can also add some ruins in plains from cobblestone and stone bricks. Also what about adding some mods with western weapons like revolvers, and shotguns, but in order to balance ammo will be extremely rare. Also you can add as if it was a colony long time ago, but contact was lost and due to island (or continent?) being surrounded by seaguardians or other creatures (kinda like subnautica world border called "Ecological dead zone" or "Void", also it is a lot of work and probably nobody gonna go further beyond). You can also add something to the nether, like piglin kingdom (I don't know whether you have thought about that already or not, but I'm just saying). Well that's all my ideas for now. It may be quite a lot, but well, you asked us at the start of the video and I replied.
Imagine if he and jeracraft make a minecraft world together.. just wow
make the snow biome skyrim related 😮  Fire btw, I’m looking forward to seeing the rest of these biomes and playing this world 🔥🔥
NOW I KNOW WHY YOU HAVE 1 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS.
Jeez how long did this take I would be 500 before I could finish it 😮
cant wait to play this
love the temple of time reference
omg it is so good thx we will love it
Will this be playable on bedrock aswell as Java? I know some of us don’t have PC so having this available on bedrock would be pretty cool
Would be a great molded minecraft server map
Cool
Pls add castle at the big island
The Company should hire you as a worker who designs the biomes, this is just so cool
Question: when I download this map, is there a world border around the outside or can you explore beyond the edges? Definitely getting this as soon as it’s done, looks absolutely amazing!
Trixyblox : “A quaint little windmill”   Proceeds to make the biggest building in the village.
Also something cool could be adding the underground empire to this world and make it to have huge caves, or maybe adding some of your creations like the desert black pyramid, the end stronghold in a underground forest or the underwater empire
Where i can download it? I want to make a survival with friends
Please make indian references across the map
Map download link ?
TrixyBlox: Turns clerics to wandering traders Actual wandering traders: Am I a joke to you?
Fantastic video!! 🔥🔥🎉🎊👏
i take small villages and turn them into massive Towns using only the materials included in the generated structures, but repeating with the same house and occasional mansion related houses with interior and basement, and upgraded paths from Gravel to Smooth Stone and added bridges giving access to smaller town parts.  the reason why i repeat with same decided house as before is because i have hard time planning different housing over and over again
Man asked for 80k likes and got half a million
80K likes, he said. We gave 500K.
When is the world download coming
Ur not playing being god, god is playing to being u

Plz part 2
Number 2 please
This build is going to epic! I’m glad YouTube recommended this to me
I see it in everything....
Just..incredible, I'm gonna use this map when you finish it for a MMORPG, it looks great
Dungeon
Where is the stronghold or end portal? Do you had a plan to change nether and the end world that always same?
La mejor idea que tuviste hasta ahora, es genial!
ADD A RICK ROLL MEME ITS A GONNA BE PERCEFT
You have inspired me to take my time to build really cool buildings. You are a very talented & creative Minecraft builder. Awesome job!
Will this be available for bedrock? 🙏🙏🙏🙏
I think the plains biome need some more flowers buy wow this is so good
Wow, those ideas are even better than the game. Actually, in the Minecraft game its biomes are not that realistic (not even good).
The pillager outpost is definitely my favorite, that tower is amazing.
World Tree
Wow. I'm so excited to play this map.
i NEED TO GET THIS
Why cant minecraft just be like this
We want more ❤️
New Luke the notable video “I Survived 100 days in trixyblox’s ultimate survival world”
That's amazing, I'm really excited for the rest
80k likes? How about 500k
best thing ever
Dang so cool...thats the world of my dreams but I can only play minecraft on my phone 🥲
is there anything like this but already done?
add bigfoot in the snow biome
amazing
amongus
I need this in my life! Sign me up for the download link!
Mojang should hire you
If the real Minecraft villages were like this I would rather kill a villager and steal their house. Just saying the truth
mojang needs this man.
@Wadzee should try this
how about not doing it Survival map.. but making a big puzzle adventure map? That would be so fun to play/stream
Oh and thx for adding potato's those are my favorite 😁😁😁
Can you include a  sky island zone? Or a volcanic zone?
This video was amazing! Personally I'm excited to see what you see with the dark forest, I imagine there are probably a lot of fantasy routes you could take with that. If I could suggest maybe making the forest very densely populated tree-wise in some places so navigation is a bit more difficult and requires both horizontal and vertical navigation that would be pretty cool, but no matter what I'm definitely downloading this map to play. Probably the most excited I've been about Minecraft in years lol
Add it to pe too please
Damn
https://youtu.be/KwFatK1qaqI
Can u make a list with all of the commands? It would be great!😊❤❤
Add a boss
I would definitely play Minecraft if it was more detailed like this this is just amazing
best builder in minecraft
When will this be on the patreon
This map is beast map in my life nice bro
That's so cool
I want this......but I play on Xbox
This kinda looks like amphibia
Project is amazing, but I think you should put less walls to surround farm ans crops... It's look unatural
add events and event stuff and a thingy where you pvp with other people and also add trading and event bosses for like event swords and other stuff
Put a DeLorean in the mines. Please.
Ocean Man
This reminds me of Bionicle for some reason
Imagine play this world with mod, fantastic
This minecraft world is insane i love it, Btw im your new subsciber :)
How do even make these kinds of videos? That was amazing
Plz make this for pocket edition too
80k likes hahhhahahahahhahahhahahahahahhaha child’s play
epic
So much for 80k likes 😂😂😂
I wish this was default minecraft MOJANG PPEASE HIRE THIS MAN  Amazing job dude👍👍
Bruh im so keen
i just want to play this map but i dont know how?
You could put a boarded up abandoned house into some or all villages, it would have a zombie villager and a basement leading into spooky catacombs inside. Totally cool I think. Also, you could put some lore inside it.
could you hide a rick roll of some kind ? it would be epic lmao
I hope you put normal trees because I couldn’t break those pretty ones
makes village *happy villager noises*
I can’t fathom how much effort you put into this❤️
Siiiiick +1 sub
brush yo teeth
Just one question, when next part???
Algum Br
This man has earned a hard earned subscription
That project is pretty good would definitely follow this series  Also add a large prehistoric fossil on the desert or tundra
:o I might play this until a die XP but idk but I'm sure gonna play this map
Minecraft in 2031 world its like these i hope so though
Maybe adding some little islands for the biomes that are not featured like the one for the mooshroom island would be cool af
ig u will remake the entire nether
Probably have to come back to Minecraft once this map is getting released, looks sick so far!
Upgrade your tooth brush
Oh my 😍
Who before 1 million likes?
How do I download this world?
imagine if the nether biomes are here too
You going to convert public this map??
hayo tebak ni maps brp GB:v
Everybody has had this idea at some point in time. I’m just glad someone really did it
This is awesome. I really want to play it!
Incredible but you forgot the bamboos jungle ! Add it and you can be sure your map is perfect
Can i download this map on mobile minecraft?
Can you Reveal your Own House And Your Own World To See All Of Your Subscribers And Fans Please 🙁

1:20 Why does it look like pacman but downways lmao
I hope you didn’t forget to make the pillager outpost spawn pillagers
Where is other biomes?
Alright, I REALLY want to play, now.
dream should speed run this
Likes he asked: 80k Like he got: 490k  Seems Legit
What about an (Inactive) Volcano in the middle with a lava lakes near in it
Man... just amazing , Great job
Hope the map releases for Bedrock too...
Sub✅
80,000 like not 500,000likes
Litcherally
I directly subbed after watching this
will you upgrade nether too?
How about dragon head in deasert
Did you know if you have a 3 by 3 and by 2 sides redstone blocks 2 block high and put a wall there you have a weird wall :)
Wait...how would the pillagers stay in the new tower? They wouldnt naturally spawn at it...would they?
THIS IS SO COOL KEEP WORKING HARD MAN
you should make an mmorpg like server
After 999999 million years later I might do this in CREATIVE
Can't wait for part two! Ideas: - mountains in the snowy biome and maybe even outside of it. - a secret civilization inside one of the mountains.  Ideas for Easter egg:  - in a village you can find a book that would lead to a treasure hunt. - you can find the iron throne from game of thrones somewhere. - 50 player heads of you can be found in secret places around the world
Wow
U GOD  make a real world  😱😱😳😳
Wow
I’m just... impressed...  wow
there needs to be bamboo for scaffolding if there is not bamboo already
If only you could make these upgraded buildings in this world actual replacements for in-game structures because they're fucking amazing.
with what programm have you draw the bioms and the circel ?  and what does it cost ?
I never knew you can generate a custom world through a third party application.
Y don’t you have eyelashes on one side?
would be pretty cool to have a "vacant" house in each village / town. so we can move into the area ourselves
video got me to subscribe, looking forward to the future of this project
I thing u make a server for free I can join
It's beautiful it's 😭😭
Best project idea ..just speechless with those upgrades Now imagine that broken nether portable connecting to the neather .. with the same idea on the other side  (all nether biomes proportioned )
this reminds me a bit to the Zelda botw map but i think thats only me. A very cool idea you have i am looking forward to play it. Very good job.  Edit: I just continued watching the Video and it seems like im not the only one comparing the map to botw XD
please make it available for Bedrock/pocket edition
ily man
Yo nice biome transform!!! If you can start a series of transforming the DREAM SMP I will sub you
Trixy please make it free this is sooo cool but i cant pay for it😢
I really appreciate your work
what is the seed of the world? existing the seed for bedrock?
Niceeee
Its stupid that mojang hasent make something like this and that a fan has to make it for us🤦‍♂️
this looks amazing! also, for the Mesa’s railroad, i’d recommend using a YouTuber named “CraftyFoxe”s tutorials. He makes some amazing minecraft trains, and i feel like a map this epic could use some epic trains for the railroad. :) again, everything looks amazing, and i can’t wait to see the final product! 👍🏻
You are legend. This is very butiful
Hey I don’t know if we have to pay but if you make the world for us to play could it be free and if not only 5$
I like this allot. But I really hope it gets finished. Bc thinks like that really push your patience.
can you make this into a server?
How I can download this world  map
This guy dead#ss made an rpg world on Minecraft. Looking forward to a download! Keep the good work going!
Vim pelo jazzghost
Imagine just taking a villagers house instead of making one cause u know u suck at building (^o^)
It took me 4days making a village on Mobile and just seeing this makes me feel weak but damn
Its okay, only 7 more episodes to go
Eu sou o comentário brasileiro que vc esperava
Little more than 80k likes. Congrats. You deserve all the likes and even more
We want link
10:14 minor changes he says
I would have like to see day night cycle to see how long it took him
Build Farron’s Keep from Dark Souls  idk
I'm shook
Wow... Incredible. The level of details of this map is just amazing. I'm gonna make a server for me and my friends with this map when it will be finished.
Isn't the Thumbnail or the island from amphibia
Even if he use world what ever its called i cant even do things like this
Mojang,hire this guy.
HOW ARE YOU *JUST* ASKING FOR 80K. it’s fine to be more selfish
Wow
Could have a massive volcano by the center being the entrance to the nether, which also explains how the island came to be.
question did he say 80k likes  cuz i think he meant over 500k
make on ehidden crashed UFO with alot of very high end loot
meanwhile me who cant even build a villager house
It would be great if You put a link in the description of the map without the strucures
This makes me sad that I dont have a computer to play java :(
Please Share This Map In Description
Tell to me that i can download and play with friends please
second by second my buildings grew prettier
I use printer cuz printer goes brrrrrrrrrrrrr
Maybe you can build a haunted island where there is a abandoned castle and village over there with ship wrecks all around the island
yooooooooooo you are a really good builder, keep going😁
Me on bedrock. ~Sad ps4 noises~
this looks like the angry bird island
the mushroom biome do Finy and Furbes villian base
Lol not gonna lie ima have to kill those villagers and keep the village myswlf
This is super nice 👍🏼 keep it up
you shold a gigant ruined construction on the top of the mountain
“Just some minor changes” *proceeds to completely redo the design*
Crashed UFO?
Minecraft would be so much more fun if it was made like this thank you for this!!
U should work with Minecraft
This guy is sooooo underrated.
This is going to be epic. That's really all anyone can say.
I just imagining this map with mods and custom achievement
Wish it could be in the minecraft java
Add some dwarven underground vault somewhere in the mountains. Maybe even make a honeydew reference.
1:04 looks like a brain and also pangea
wow
8 bayom
i really cant wait to play this map. Im a explorer so i love you made plenty of things to explore and delve into. I LOVE the new church here as im also a Botw fan
This is amazing, and it even looks like Wano of One Piece
Can my name be in the world?
Map setup looks like it could work for a Zelda world
Amazing, really cool
No commentary pls
HE : find the world secrets ur self one the other hand :SIKE no download :wand download ? : pay for it in patreon :just give us some😂😢😢😢😢😢😢
You should put your Pyramid in Dessert.. And your underground castle in Forest Biome
I need this map
This is perfect.
Kinda wish I was a villager now
I like exploring then survive It is awesome How much time did he take  Iam exited ❤️❤️
what he says: I'll mimic vanilla minecraft!  what really happen: a new mod
he needs at least a mil for his dedication
80k likes? Now its like 500k. Think bigger boy!😁
Awesome, you spend so much time, Thoughts, and strength to do this. This map look AWESOME♥️❤️♥️❤️. I like when minecraft look like this, not only small houses by minecraft and everything what i know. I do like when minecraft developers will add something like you do. I will play minecraft more.
well... guess this will cause another random 2 week minecraft addiction
On the pillager outpost you should add stables for ravagers
Pokemon
How to download what you did?
Wow.
It would be cool if the nether also had this type of map,
When you will upload it?
You got me hooked at Bob Ross XD
I am SO EXCITED for this oh my god. Can't wait to see what the other biomes look like and play it once it's done!!
Wow.
Me: How you do dat? Video: Timelapse while explaining Me: I dont have a lue whats going on but i'll act that i do
will there be a map download in the future
Well you forget the blacksmith house

My opinion Is that the Wild West Will be the best
Bro you are hella talented
Wano?
You should try to get this put in the Minecraft marketplace I’d love to play it on xbox
Poor ur eyebrow
where can i play this map
Some government should hire this guy to design big cities

WOW
this deserves much more attention, dude, HONESTLY, this fucking awesome i love you <3
this is beautiful. but for survival play, the simplicity of Minecraft is what makes it so much fun. if everything built in the world already looks better than anything you can possibly build, there's no fun in building yourself.
How about make this in to a quest
I came for Jazzghost Do the "J"
Add a secret dungeon that has like 10-20 floors.
i wouldnt have thought that i‘d be subscribing to a minecraft channel in 2021 but i‘m not complaining
"I'm only adding minor changes here..." Your honor, I accuse the defendant of cap 🧢

@jazzghosth
this man would make a fucking KILLER dm in dnd
Make a big spiders cave
Minecraft needs to hire this man
wtf this
imagine this in hardcore
In the Taiga you could do German themed houses and in the mountains you should as Swiss chalet houses
Nuke silo with tnt
secret giant camber
I find it quite strange how many Minecraft builders upon hitting the "expert" level *always* seem to struggle with simplification/"vanillafication" (or upgraded vanilla looks). It showed especially with the trees and the cathedral
Add dangerous mobs into this and this is truly the Ultimate Survival World
Mojang would like to know your location.
This is amazing
Where can I download Minecraft from please
AMONG US??
This is gas
I wish i can build thoa good OwO
Add a upgraded end city
Wow
Bro this guy is a hypixel builder like wtf
Recommendation: the huge nether portal should have a giant rib beside it so it looks like a battle happened there hundreds of years ago
Will you be updating the end and nether
hope there will be some kinds of bosses
"Make sure to get this video to 80 thousand likes"    *He a little confused, but he got the spirit.*

Can I play this on bedrock Edition
You could do a wood elf kingdome in the black wood with à giant tree !
A secret underground battle ground
are you gonna work in nether?
Keep going
WHERE CAN I GET THIS MAP
You got to build an abandoned mine inhabited by some outcast dwarves. What I mean is one part of the mine is an abandoned tunnel, which leads to some sort of secret entrance. Then from there is a flourishing underground colony with separate sub tunnels, and who knows, you could add a secret in there or something.
Trixy five years from now: i transformed earth to a whole another level

Plsss make a part 2
How do your fingers NOT HURT
This is awesome!!✨👀
Please can we have a version that's just barebones biomes so we can build from scratch for ourselves. I'm thinking of putting in the hours to just copy your design closely, that's how bad i want this
Sorry is 485k bigger than 80k my math is bad 😂
you are a great builder!
The dedication is very professional if only this was work. :'(
The bright maid controversly fit because giraffe cellularly appreciate about a tired step-son. aquatic, third rat

Build an Infected iland
is this map public ?
О чувак, ты на Eazy-E похож
I'm always amazed how people can build extremely complex structures in Minecraft. There would be so many mistakes and uneven block placements if I did it.
An idea for the winter biome if you've played AC Walhalla, the crazy big open maze looking spot in the mountains when you're in norway late game
This looks so cool
A moment of silence for those who didn't get this recommendation, Now we like and subscribe
Can I play this map or is that privatel
I have liked and this video has more than likes  So can i get this world please..
this looks so sick
Im kinda sad because i have minecraft but im not able to become a patron so i can only look at the builds but im hoping this one will be downloadable without becoming a patron
That village reminds me a lot of villages from the Witcher. With the farm with very haphazardly placed irrigation. Very nice. Can't wait to see what the rest of this looks like, or with it raytraced. That would be amazing
Is it possible for this to be transported to bedrock once finished?
Wish there was an Yggdrasil type tree in the middle of the Island but still, your work is amazing man !!!!!!!!!
secret magic laboratory in the snowy mountains
This is crazy
I love the style of this biome. Rustic and medieval
SIMPLY FUCKING AMAZING, 100,000/10

Jou can add a witch covenant
Imagine playing in this world and the structures are better than your house.
I want to download these map

You should add a Mordor-like custom biome maybe in the nether, but without a roof, and a giant volcano, and of course, a tower with a very certain eye on it.
This is what Playing God in Minecraft is truly is
I’m really hyped for the Wild West town build in the Mesa biome
Man, it's... like... the point is... hhhh wow gg

Would it be possible to actually create a random Minecraft world where in the game file structures and so forth are changed so they naturally spawn like this
Make a volcano it *will* look very cool
My mans is DEDICATED
trixy: need 80,000 likes for download :) viewers: 500'00 0 likes
wait,is that a villager with more building!?!?!?
You probably know this but i just want to say that you can also use item frames + locked maps for decoration (For disclaimers: maps showes chunks so you can fill chunks with blocks to make art on it, write something, cover surfaces with the colors you want and you can also make it detailed and that's the best part of it.)
hloy shit dude, can´t wait to play on this map : D
The map looks like among us
how long did this take lol Edit: try editing the nether biomes, end city, the end and the stronghold
Helo
Once this is out, I’ll be living in the Snowy Mountains.
Pls make a huge treasure room at y 13
You are a good
Make a mod to pair with the map, and make it a story focused experience
Imagine, Playing this with the Pixelmon Mod. This would be a perfect adventure map
You Should add a huge pillager hq with a bunch of loot and treasure. Btw I love this video it’s amazing 🤩
I never play Minecraft, but i just want to install it and play with this world he created
Can't wait to download 😀
Pls more Olympus and Spartan and more and grecce and dwarves and goblins and More spawns you need make more of spawns
Yo low-key that looks like the Land Of Wano. Anyone?
Im impressed! And u asked what u could add and heres my idea: Magic Wands,Cool Swords,Atlantis,Cool Armor,Cool Ores and yeah  Edit: wheres the link😅  Edit 2 : you can add a stone biome where a village is and next to the village there a big underground cave and villagers mine in there i mean a Mining village/cave  Edit : u can add dungeons
You should add a volcano
Boi you just gain new subscriber

So nobody will talk about how the iland look sus?
My man get a kickstarter or someone to help
Maybe a Mosque for the desert village instead of a church
I found this guy on reddit, he is an actually cracked builder.
☹️☹️☹️ I'm such a bad builder
This really needs a thorough RPG mod created specifically for this world! Would love to see quests through this massive world with dialogues and characters and secret items.
I have a challenge for you, you should build a world or something in survival, i wanna see what your survival skill or worlds are like!
Those villagers working hard
Zs
ABSOLUTE MAD LAD
Absolutely mad! I've already seen people recommending a witch hut in your map which I would like to add something extra too it: a potion pool.  The story is that the witch dumped her failed potion brews into a small pond next to her hut. This caused some weird biological manipulation to the surrounding area creating glowing mushrooms and such. If you go down the pond, you'll find empty cauldrons and bones from her victims.
Niceeeee..
Map name= trixymaps
bro, your girlfriend is very beautiful😏
Can u do this as map for bedrock
This is to cool!
If u would add seasons(summer,winter,rain etc) that would be more fun
seed for this
Give link to this map
This is beyond min boggling, how long do you think youd have going at it util it in a playable state that your happy with?
Idea: Add me :)
Why so british
So how would it be available for bedrock edition people?
wow. it looks so awesome <3
The central plains?!
Can we download this in mobile when you finish it ?I will very appreciate it because I'm a Minecraft PE player
I have to ask. Are there ores. Cause if it’s made in paint then is there proper things to make it an actual playable world
Idea: can you try adding a jungle themed village but the houses will be on the Trees and try making an epic farm on the ground and add stairs so that the villagers can go to their tree houses and go down to farm or work
Hey also do a nether spawn
There is so much detail it looks great best builder in Minecraft right here
Im in. Truly magnificent! Creative... Mmm mm!
Would this be available for Minecraft PE?
do a flootating island in the sky whit a god palace
Just beautiful
it looks amazing!
I think you should add some kind of underwater abandoned lab (if you need some inspiration you can search for game SOMA) Two abandoned Bunkers with loot and story Ancient- aliens structures(you can get inspiration from terraria) Flying island Steampunk town  Statues and remains of ancient people abandoned factories (its just suggestions not all of this has to be added)
where the "WTF" Button?
The big question is, will you make the map playable on bedrock edition?
I think some cool stuff could be done with the idea of pillagers basically being bandits. You could have a destroyed trade caravan with some tilled dirt to represent tracks that lead to a pillager camp where they’ve captured some villagers. You could have a large dungeon where for the first half, there were pillagers, but you eventually get to a point which the pillagers couldn’t get to, and now you have to fight the undead within the inner layers of the dungeon. This is such a cool idea, and a lot could be done with it
Jesus Christ I don’t think I’ve ever been excited for something THIS MUCH  Also something really interesting you could do is put extra ore in the large Boulders
Mojang will like this but his pc will not hahahahah😄
Gonna make a request that probably won't get much attention but worth a shot anyways, any chance of a version of this map released thats mostly just default minecraft? No custom structures just the filled out map with vanilla villages and structures? I'd love to play on this with my friends but i don't really want a map where so much is already prebuilt for me
Omg this is Amazing
I love your video  Good luck 🍀 for you
You should be the owner of mojang
I'm speechless and nothing to say but I'll say something, WOW!!!!!! Just wow I really want this map it's just so awesome 😎 wish for good luck if you made more map like this.
*oh my god this is the best minecraft masterpiece iv'e ever watched hh-*
I Germany we say: So ein geiles Produkt!!!
Lobby of the game
Breath of the wild in Minecraft.
COOL!
This will be so good if he make it a rust game so ppl cant raid the map
Wait, that's Minecraft? 🌀👄🌀
*Pewdiepie needs to play this*
Wtf this is insane the best project so vare
80.000 Likes.....  🤣🤣Nice joke  Damn nearly half a Million
Очень крутой видеоролик! Я бы Грибной остров подальше от берега отодвинул, в океан.
It would be a great idea to add caravans, militia patrols, or even campsites along the paths between villages to break up the flat road.
add a storyline please!!!!!!!!! Also to the snowy mountains add the bigfoot and add bigfoots cave at the highest mountain
it's exceed 80k like now where's the other?
Me being like  "If I play this ima just live in a pre-built structure"😏
you should add a giant skeleton of some sort of ancient being, or a giant rusty robot using the new copper blocks
We can download the map?
Oh my goodness
Since this is going to be survival friendly, are there going to be ore veins underground?
The zelda community is pleased
Him: I miscalculated the size if the map a little, its actually 16,000,000 blocks Me: "you didn't miscalculated, only happy accidents"
This guy always put so much effort for his videos
Wano country?😂
Mapa legal
Hello there TrixyBlox can you build gain like that but with a minecraft mod like RLcraft mod, or machinery mod and other thing that can be use for good building pls

Can't wait

I'm actually.. EXCITED to play it. Good job!
Somebody should make a mod that makes some of these structures naturally generating in a regular world.
crazy crazy crazy I hope this map gets out soon!!
Bro if you designed Minecraft ,there would be nothing to stop from making Minecraft the best game ever for decades!!!
Whenever I watch this type of videos it always reminds me of monster hunter and how majestic there world is

Would Ores spawn in this world? so I can play here after it is done
amazing
Mans wanted 80k likes got 447k 😅
do we have the map ?
That meat block at campfire is overcooked, so much so that you can use it to make bed.
Add end corruption in mountains biome and will this world download be for free?
Idea: try code in a every 10 minute event which 10 people can join  and it teleports u to the pillager outpost and the ten people have to kill all the pillagers in 3 minutes if they havent killed them they lose all the food in there inventory:edit u should make a currency to join it
I think in the ocean biome next to the big island there could be a little island with a light house and a bridge over to the big island
Add a hidden door in a cave
Le Trixy-Ultimate survival world Le Minecraft Creator-My time has come!

Do the different structures like the updated pillager towers still work in game as pillager towers? As in they spawn the pillagers? Or is this purely decorative?
Imagine this added to minecraft 1.19😂😂

I love that the villagers started working the fields when you conpleted it. Minecraft has become such a lively world since I first started playing.
This actually looks like a great map for epic quest!
You have a lot of talent
Good job
We love you
Amazing work
Wow im excited for the wild west village
This video is epic

Can you realise a copy with nothing built on except vanilla structures it so we can play it like a proper generated survival world?
I so hope we get to play this this is worth paying for
This is awesome dude
Dude you should be working in open world game design, seriously impressive stuff.
But will it have 1.17 caves with copper gen and crystals?
WOW!!!

He should do a video where he does this stuff in bedrock, like so trixyblox can see
Can I download the world?
looks like Land of OOO
Him: I am not the Mesahia Us: He is the Mesahia
Tho i really wish you make the stronghold including the end portal massive like then make it like a more realistic estate on the spawner
if you were to release the map can I make a mod pack with it
I have never REALLY played minecraft.. only download it illegal and playing around a bit... But when I look at this.... I am thinking of actually buying the game and playing this map when its done....
When you isekai’ed into an adventure life in minecraft
Literally this world is way more better than real Minecraft world .I think trixy should work with mojang
Bro I loved this video. The epic details u put into minecraft are just too Good. I hope u finish soon bc I can't wait to try this map
a grand castle for pillager?
Will all the villages be connected by a pathway? I think it'd be interesting to have a village which is located inside a mountain.
Imagine if minecraft added this.... i would play it everyday!
it would be awesome if minecraft had extra world type: ultra. the world type would have all these awesome builds and still we had the normal minecraft.
Jezus thats so cool. Please try to get mojang to put it in the bedrock marketplace
Please make this map playable for everyone.
Can you make a bedrock edition version pls
I once tried/started doing this same kind of thing...though I can't say it was nearly as thorough and beautifully made as yours. Damn I quite envy your building style. Nice job!!!
I feel like I'm in Clash of Clans upgrading the buildings.
Cant wait to play with friends

Who disliked this? For what purpose?
Next time can you build it pocket edition
imagine this is in a minecraft animation,      oh no...
This is amazing keep up the GREAT WORK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!11
The only problem with playing this map is that everything you build is uglier than what's already there

Its all fun in games 'till he turned Minecraft into an open world Narnian like rpg
Sometimes, fans can make game better than developer.
That church looks so cool
at this point just join hermitcraft
This guy it's just so creative
Awesome, you should build on big pleasure hunt that can only be complete when you have complete all others. "The big score"
I love so much all that you did in this map !
It is just like a big game like paths and a adventurous day
You have done a lot of hard work in placing every single block
This is the best minecraft vid ive ever seen
Imagine you and your gang just decided to do a Roleplay on this map?

It'd be so awesome if you waited a bit until 1.17 releases and then made a huge amethyst cave or something
I wonder why vanilla Minecraft didn't look like this in the first place
6:53 I am a dummy 😶
Why did i expect the whole island to be done in the 15 minutes  Holy fuck what a legendary build

The Ring Island of Solitude

When notch and herobrine see this: holy moly You: make me a cf Reator of  minecraft
Will there be also a big castle on the mountain? ^^ would love some castle Neuschwanstein vibes :) greetings from Germany!  I definitely love this project and would support it anytime.
amazing good work blox if mojang saw this he will be amazed just like me
In the ice biome make a wizard or a witch tower (THIS IS MY FIRST TIME WATCHING THIS CHANNEL AND I LOVE IT 1 SUB) FROM ME
You are the new COC Builder. Congratulations my man.
I rhis for freee
If you build a bridge to the mushroom island that has broken down
Honestly... cathedrals are *absurdly* big, and midsize churches usually feel pretty spacious, so I'd say that's a reasonable size church, if not especially for the size of the settlement, which probably wouldn't have the material wealth to construct it.  It's really well designed, regardless of whether it's realistic.
Try to add new mobs and items
🤩🤩❤️💯🔥
I hope this works on consoles and mobile too😔😔
Hey bro....   Brush your teeth better. Especially the bottoms.
And mojang still hired a stupid designer for their structures
Ohh this is wano in Minecraft 👁️
Resident evil  merchant xD ^^ cool idea bro!

This is amazing, i s it downloadable ?
Make this a world genarator with the stuctures

In the snow biome, create an abandoned train as a reference to Snowpiercer.

That pillage tower is actually AMAZING!

Ngl the map seems pretty sus
I fully intend to play this when you finish it
My eyes
You just wanted 80k likes and got 500k likes 😂
Good JOB men keep up!!! We will be supporting ur project
Well done. Very impressive
imagine Dream is playing this
This is taking Etho’s ‘enhanced biomes’ to a new level. Awesome, keep it up!
You should choose an "endgame" biome, and make a castle for players to conquer.
Once the transformation is done.. find one to make a mod out of it
Trixyblox: asked for 80k likes 4 days later  Everyone: gives 476k likes cause everyone wants to see this
Can there be a bedrock version 😭
this is the coolest thing i've ever seen
4:56 already sympathetic
This hit me hard, you know hos hypixel used to make big story map the nostalgia is real here
😱😱😱
The clouds in the timelapse are so cool, you couldn’t tell if that was real life or minecraft if you cropped out the world around them. The wonders of shaders.
I would like you to add a hanging village in the jungle connected within a cliff and tree at the same time of u like it please add if u can
This is so cool😮
This Guys Is Working Real Hard I Think we all should subscribe him for sure

One Of The Best Builders in Minecraft history I hope he gets 100 millions subscribers and millions of likes and compete some overrated Minecraft channels.               Also I Subbed him and  liked the video too  too
Aight it exceeded 80k likes. Weres the download link?
Idea: Connect mushroom island with the main island with simple rope bridge
Best Idea: Make a survival series with friends on this world if had any strongholds 😀.   (Idea already guessed by MandJTV)
Yo is it possible to play this map at ps4??
In the snow biom I think you should add a camp
13:29 HELP ME SONG NAME PLSSS
what file or apk to make that world
Holy... just... very impressive. It’d be cool to see an abandonned fortified city, it would add to the lore to what happened that a whole city would be destroyed.
<4
Bootleg mata nui. But in all fairness this is great. Keep up the amazing work.
Is this work on minecraft pe cuz... I download and play survival in it
This looks SUPER DUPER IMPRESSIVE! Like, wow. I'm speechless. Also, I had 2 ideas. One, a journal of a seasoned explorer, one that explored this island WAY before you, and left his own journal entries inside significant structures like igloos, or in small bases and campsites built next to ancient ruins and temples. A sort of a timeless guide that would add some lore through his archeological discoveries. Who knows, maybe what he says doesn't exactly match up with what you now see, to show something has happened in-between.  The other idea was aliens. A crashed UFO, more specifically. The mushrooms from that single mushroom island had to come from somewhere, right?
ITS INSANE!
Dude wow I'm speechless I am so excited to play it.
Him:if u want download get this video to 80k likes Us: how bout 400k
This looks incredible. One thing i would love to see in a project like this is custom weapons, something like the unique weapons in skyrim. Custom names, custom enchantements, maybe even custom sprites and they could only be found in big structures or secret places.
Hey! If the survival world gets finished after the like goal and is released. Would it be okay to stream it with credit to you? Id LOVE to stream the world, with full credit to you obviously
What about a snowe castle
fake and gay

For the jungle biome, I think that a village hidden in the trees could be a good idea (sorry for the few mistakes, i'm french!!)
Mod link please
465k likes today. "80,000 likes for part 2". so that was a lie. no offense.

Isn't satisfying to see how man arts adopted to computer in many different way that we still valued all over again

Imagine if this map is released, then someone add a RPG mod with Dark Souls vibes where you can kill monsters and do some quest on this map.
This man should revive a metal for #1 Builder in Minecarft I can’t even imagine how long would it take to this build this..!

And this all is vanilla Minecraft. Imagine this with mods.
Philza minecraft but on a whole other level
You could make some mineshafts underground that have entrances above ground and also some rivines
After I saw that video, I opened game made a dirt house and quit
Idk if it's just me, but the original world concept with the different biomes around the center of a circular area reminds me of the second arena from the Hunger Games, with the clock styling. Incredible build though, the technical skill on show is very impressive
Bro TrixyBlox You Screen Card ?
Wow, so impressive! 😌
More woooooo It’s so cool
Is there ores in that map so we can mine
Imagine a modded collaboration version for this map. It would be INSANE.
How to download this map

You are the world's best builder

I pray whoever see this you’ll be successful in life, God has a plan for you just trust the process never give up God bless everyone...❤️
The first thing I did before the video started was to check if this was downloadable. Unfortunately it's not.      YET.
This video blew up and he deserves it 100% because he puts so much time an effort into these things for us
when you finish give this map to us please
Make a dangerous bridge from the mooshroom island to the plains
Mojang wants to know your location
I want this guy to rebuild my base. I made it out of Concrete and Terracotta but now I want it to become more woodish like that Pillager tower.
Minecraft - The Ultimate Survival World?
This made me so interested in making my own custom map. Thank you so much!
Is it only for Java or bedrock too
My PC: Hmmm how about N O
now thats a village!!
You should also redo the nether as a similar idea with the different biomes. It would also be cool to have the ender dragon somewhat of a really hard to beat final boss.
Temple run?
I was ignoring this video like 5-6 times then I was like why it's keep recommending me and played the video and it was my best disition
More than perfect
Where could I find a computer powerful enough to generate this...

You are really talented. Man, I wish I have the talent to build stuff. Keep up the good work :)
The only "problem" i have is the fact that i already saw whay you did, its gonna be awesome to actualy play and explore this map, cant wait.
you know it is going to be perfect when he said he used botw as a reference  love it <3
This is honestly the most sick minecraft map ever and I am so looking forward to (possibly) playing it!
The dedication is uncanny... Well done!
Where can I get the map
Memes references bro
Omg
maybe you should add some new mobs or maybe have some mods that go with the map like a new boss
Video Idea:Upgrading Igloo in Minecraft
Viking themed village for the taiga/snow biome?
I wish it will become battle royale game map...
Can do toturial plss
Is this available to play!?!??!?! THATS AMAZING 🤩🤩🤩
Suggestion:if you made an abandoned village can you add a crossbow or bow with arrows with a secret bunker with villagers. Guns tend to be strong so maybe put power 3 on them if you do it
If you see this, please please add some wrecked ships/boats! It would be very cool and you could do a lot with the story with them! Not the ones that come in Minecraft, like BIG ones, REAL wrecked ships.
It would be very cool if it was able to playbon bedrock, but the whole wolrd id just unvelievably good
Hey maybe try adding bosses in the biomes that would seem pretty cool and the bosses will drop cool items when killed
Can't wait to find the Bob Ross reference
If you know how can you add this to the in-game mincrat store that way consoles can play it
Why does the thumbnail look like jeracraft is this the same dude?

Just epic !
He has black eyes  How.
playing to Phone
NEW game is
A very big tree..maybe in the middle..would be awesome i think..like the one in avater amd maybe also with small tree houses too❤
looks very nice, the only and biggest problem is the base generation done in worldpainter, hear me up please, I don't want to hate, but seeing how flat those fields can get just makes your whole survival experience generic without expecting much from discovering those lands, you see, there's a very good reason why people loved the old minecraft alpha generation worlds, there's been so much height change in the terrain - you never knew what comes next few blocks in front of you, lands could go deep almost to caves and quick back to steep cliffs and huge mountains with holes and very challenging terrain. Walking across your terrain is not very satisfying from survival mode point of view as there's not much random going on - you are in almost flat plains knowing that they will probably be the same way in another 100 blocks in front of you, same goes for hills - you know there's a hill slowly shaping it's way up in front of you - you know it will probably continue to the top that way, with nothing interesting going on with the terrain. I do a lot of terraforming myself and we did an interesting experiment on one of our servers, we made a custom sakura forest biome very close to the spawn of the world - full build for survival mode (caves, materials, ores, mineshafts, rivers, survival friendly custom trees with decayable leaves, etc) and it was a very nice looking 500x500 area even without shaders and let players do whatever they wanted to with it - and funny enough most of the players chose the other directions from spawn and went for default vanilla biomes instead, even tho there was many interesting places where they could build in our custom biome. I suggest you to make sure there's always something going on every 100 blocks or so, custom builds are nice but it's not the main thing that makes your survival world interesting enough to keep you playing for hours/days.
I'm so hyped
Your work is really inspiring
What if vanilla minecraft is made by dis guy it 2ould be awesome
Make the trader wagon move from time to time using comands
This is what I always plan to do..I just cant. Im glad someone else did T_T
I CANT BUILD CRAP AND U BUILD A WHOLE BIOME?/?? I have no words...
Also add a wood land mainson.
This man is the Picasso of Minecraft
WOULD love IF you could include some RARE aninals :D
Kinda getting Skyrim vibes
Ummm I don't know what to say.... ...
you should make a custome structures and custome biomes mod  edit : basically make this a mod
It will really cool if you add 1 more biome that have a deep and masive holes fill with mob and treasure
where is a link to download this world?

guys, where can i download the map?
Shoulda put the desert on one side of the mountain at a much lower elevation. And put all the wet zones on one side and dry on the other.
desert biome: a giant pyramid jungle: a mysterious temple dark wood forest: a colossal tree snowy mountains: a huge mountain with cave in it that has a stronghold taiga: zombie village savanna: ? mesa: wild west and a big mountain with eagles' nest  that is what I would say about this EPIC build!
Me:breaking the wood in the map Everyone:you little bi-
SEND ME THAT F******* WORLD... Please...
Going off another comment’s idea with the abandoned village being overrun by zombies that come from an underground cave that acts as the focus. You could have the beginning of a story in this region, where a potato farmer’s journal, notes an abnormal amount of poisonous potatoes during this harvest (signaling something strange is occurring to the land). Another villager reports a missing person. Others emphasizing the disappearance, expressing empathy, and noting odd events, and somehow tying in or mentioning someone who recently moved to another area in the region. He is a lone survivor who left the village in the nick of time, but settled somewhere nearby and somewhat secluded /hidden (like a shack with defenses set up), and in his basement there is a zombie villager with a brewing stand as if he’s working on a cure. In the secluded man’s shack, there is a journal that suggests the importance of finding the source or ground zero. And how he has noticed larger numbers of zombies a cardinal direction from his shack, which leads the player to the cave entrance (more zombies signaling closer to the source) where they find a crack in the cave floor filled with soul sand. With a journal suggesting the missing villager is turning to a zombie as they write, and was the one who accidentally stumbled into the cave triggering the unknown evils.  We’re you planning on tying all the regions together with a story type of thing or have each region be it’s own independent thing?

Mojang employee: watches video  Also them: well I’m getting fired soon
I don't even like Minecraft, nor do I play it, but even I'm impressed. Well done, and I'm honestly looking forward to seeing what you do with the rest of this world - though, full disclosure, I won't be playing it. Still, much respect!  PS How did this video end up in my suggestions? Must be the Vtubers all playing Minecraft...

Hello trixy . Hope you doing well. Well want to ask you a help. Me and my Family is going through tough situation. We lost our loved ones. Now there is a problem of money. Cause of which I had to make Youtube channel. So I need help from you. Please show your support to my channel. And please do ask your viewers to view and subscribe my channel. I and my Family would be grateful to you. Thank you. Your friendly PPJ
Amazing...
Yo trix will you use custom code to this world
Only one village for the whole plains biome?
That's cool good luck boy
I would Love to Play this
give me link to download this now NOW!!
His eyes are so mesmerizing- wait what
You should also add custom caves and cave structures like dungeons and strongholds and you should use all kinds of mods so it will be the ultimate survival world and should also use ur previous builds and you should also use things like the underwater kingdom and the underground kingdom and stuff like that and use commands to make new portals
Why does tha pillager outpoust look like a enemy camp from rdr2
I would LOVE to play it, im just curious (I hope i spelled that rigt) du you think is who plays bedrock edition can download it too?
I Is MiNeCrAfT ?!!?!1?1!1?1!1?
The friendly request prognostically slow because church expectably multiply in a necessary passive. spiky, zesty flare
not downloadable ;-;
What a modeller did he use for creating map?
🐴🐏🐰🐬🐟🐢🐙🌲🌹
Over simplified
*PLEASE MAKE A FLOATING CITY OR A FLOATING ISLAND*  Edit: but it seems that this (part to be more immersive with the story) needs an end portal or would be better to be accesed thru either the nether or an elytra, placement... I dont have any recommendations but I think it would be better to put it at sea or above the mushroom biome.
Speechless
You just made a normal minecraft world a modded world my god
I hope Mojang hires u
"bring it to 80.000 likes" *Video has over 450.000* Guess I have to subscribe now to see more.
I love a single individual can make minecraft better than the developers
You should’ve named the villagers too give them character  You could take suggestions from comments if you can’t think of so many names.  Individual names can immerse the player into the game and help them keep track of a particularly useful villager.
N to entendendo nd so vim pelo jazz
You got more then 80k likes can we have the download now please
9:17 look at the spinning horse
A 💩 amoji

You're actually amazing  This is the best building I've seen in 5 years Ure really talented and I hope you continue with this series
Is this becoming a series and each episode is a biome?
You should do all types of dimension mods and   Dinosaurs and structures that minecraft doesn’t add
Absolutely playing this when its out
how. do. we. DOWNLOAD THIS?!?!?!?!?!
You should add just small monuments with puzzles
0:00 get out of my head......
how to download the world? ??
Mojang:  "Nice idea, 🤔🤨"
This guy is truly on a different level! 👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽 amazing work!!!
Waiting for part 2 😍
Gorgeous project  But I think you should make trees bugger in taiga
The map is look like Australia
your teeth are yellow
Ur a. Building god

Hello build something anime my G
Imagine building this in survival mode
My phone when I'm downloading the map: *chucles* I'm in danger
Mojang is hiring this guy
After watching that I’ve been motivated to sub. For the savannah you should stick with the acacia wood and throw in some stone and a mine and a pond right away in the middle for fisherman and I’m going to watch the beginning of that video and submit more ideas to you 👍
Why cant i build like this...........
In the desert biome, you should do an old western type theme for that biome, I honestly think that would be cool. Maybe do two villages, 1 that’s the original village for that biome and then add a second village that’s a custom town/village, that’s a western type theme build. This would look so so cool.
When raya and amphibia map is combined
Who wonts to make a big group to play wean its finished
There should be underwater base also😁
BRO PLZZZ MAP DOWNLOAD PLZZ
A skyrim reference that's a Minecraft reference, the notched pickaxe at the top of the highest mountain

That is the scream of agonising pain when you realise that you have made a 16 000 000 block world
please tell me when it is going to be published ? is it true that it will be playable ?
I never got bored watching the video, its so satisfying seeing one man doing this all.
Dude
He want 80 likes but came is huge surprise.
You make Mojang look lazy
i can not wait till this is done my mates and i will be playing this map i cant wait
Imagine this with shadders and enhanced villager mods/ animals 😫
can you also do it in its nether world and the end
this is literally fantastic- may i recommend a sort of whimsical waterfall somewhere? i think it would look pretty cool and maybe you could blend some story in with it!
Not sure if you're taking ideas but if you do the nether you could do a nether fortress
wow son cool, maby add like a big city with big walls and lots of houses.
is there a butcher profession in here?
damnnnn
Mojang has to hire you for this
Idea: How about a Vampire castle on top of the snowy mountains... Just like the one in RE8 or something similar.
This could be a good elder scrolls Minecraft map
Mojang want find your location 😂
For the ruined portal, it would be better if the staircase was more ruined not just unkept
This is really amazing Can I play it in bedrock and how do  I download it?
Looking forward to play this when you finish it. Seems to be so much fun to play with friends. Keep up the good work!
Wow u are good at building

⌐╦╦═─▄︻̷̿┻̿═━一⌐╦╦═─¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I hope the sea monument like a broken city that take tsunami if you know what i mean nice
I cant wait to play this....its amazing!
Creative boyyy
that pillager outpost looks like it came straight out of skyrim lmaooo
It would be nice if there's a flying Castle. . . you gotta go to the nether first find the hidden portal and teleport to the gates of the flying fortress. . . did I say castle?
You should add a swamp somewhere
AMAZING
I always thought the church was a castle
The statuesque stem diagnostically shave because check formerly sound pace a miniature sense. many, detailed jeep
Just subbed big project u have there
I could never do this
It looks sooooooooo GOOD!!!
This vid went super popular. Btw congrats and amazing build
The cluttered copper prominently snow because stocking ophthalmoscopically drown except a gray greasy great doll. alike, unsightly butcher
When can we download it
Yh i would be mad if i did this and didn’t get over 1mil views 😂
Bosses
Include a delorean from bttf on The railroad
Bro to good
U can build all towns from heroes of might and magic 3 on proper biomes, I'm sure it would be epic
TrixyBlox I have a really important question. I've played on custom survival maps before but they often have some of the finer things a little messed up. For example: the area around the pillager outpost doesn't actually spawn pillagers.  I'm not sure if you'll see this but if you do then please let me know if you are taking these things into consideration. If not that's fine, just would like to know.     If this is a question you would also like answered please give it a thumbs up to increase the odds of him seeing it.  (:
Just one word for this project - awesome
I need help
Minecraft RPG.
Oh finally a video where is no spammer 😘
Feels like an RPG game
Brooo you got over 400 000 likes
Mojang needs to higher you bro
Bro me just can’t even build a house when I do it looks good I guess I am getting better at this stuff but I mean after this I feel like nothing
bro do u sleep? this is mad
Brush your theeth better smh
That oak tree is better than my whole career
where can we install this eighth wonder?
Will it be playable in pocket edition
This is Minecraft with rtx on
Bruuh this is so cool
Bro the modded Minecraft potential this map has is crazy I would love to do some modded stuff to make look even cooler :3
you will do the second part??
Any man would wish for that much talent. I’m astonished.-
Honestly you’d be a great addition to hermitcraft!
can I download this world?
When I play these one I think I'm gonna stay in the village
Add a hangman in the Wild West town
The description of this map makes me really ready to play it with friends and more than likely take over the surrounding areas for ourselves. Maybe a bit of fighting over territory cause we’re all really greedy.
You forgot swamp
I want to download this map.
bro, brush ur bloody teeth
My computer will probably die of lag if I’ll try to play this 🥲
Imagine doing this without world edit. 217 hours: so guys i finished the first tree
I think it would be cool to add a bit of specialized culture in each village, maybe small structures built into the mountains of old gods of this world. Also, I think it would be cool to add a pirate yard filled with pillagers
Love it, I can't imagine the amount of hours you put in, but it's definitely paying off.  Suggestions/Ideas:  1. An Impact Crater w/ a burning meteorite in the Savanna or Mesa Ex: the crater in Flagstaff Arizona 2. A Underwater cave entrance w/ bones of fossil and ruins
Where will I find that download link for this world?
Why are you still at 1M sub you should be on 10M subs
Not going to lie and looks like a gaming controller someone to call it controller island
wow, and he made all this in 15 minutes
This man is a legend!  Respect dude
Pls make it on mcpe and mcbe
Please give the world download for bedrock edition
In one of the forest byomes build the hidden leaf village from naruto
I wouldn’t want to play it because I wouldn’t want to break anything I want to just look at it
Dont like this comment. Dont reply to this comment.
Tell me your teeth are yellow without telling me your teeth are yellow
You should do The Simpsons house in insane detail.
When it’s comes out ima blow it up
Thumbnail be sus tho... 😳😳😳
I want to play this so baddd
Make a crashed ufo!
I loved it 😤😤😤🖒🖒👌👌👌
I Cant Wait to see other Biomes
Imagine if Mojang actually decided to hire you to upgrade or improve the world building in Minecraft, just small tweaks and whatever great stuff
For the mushroom biome add like a mushroom temple where villagers praise the mushroom cows kinda like hindus in india where hindu people consider cows as holy
so this is a normal (but upgraded) survival world? with ores exctra? and do i need a really strong pc to play on this world? and it is beatiful!!
Talk about giving me the Minecraft itch again!
Hi, where can I find the map? :3
Minecraft need structure ubdate
You could possibly make Atlantis somewhere really far off the coast
Can you put a link to download the map and can I play it in bedrock edition?
This is very intresting and very well made chef kiss 10 out of 10
Trixy: Can we get 80k likes?  Fans: did you say 80k x 5 likes?
what a masterpiece
This man needs to put it on both Java and bedrock
I want to do a DND campaign based off of this oml-
Cant wait to get my hands on the world!
Imagine being the 1.7 thousand who disliked this video 🤡🤡
I want to live there forever i'll never leave also good job it really looks nice i love💕

This teeth be like get me  OUT OF HERE
Upgrade nether and end too in this map
!!! A vote to make hidden snowy cave in a small ravine where will be a bone and a note from lost traveler in snow biom. Also u can make temple in that wasteland biom in the solid rock like the Petra
I wish I could do this
Patatoes are yellow
That farm is chef kiss
Can you do a Dragon skeleton and a hidden cave base there?

I would like if you can add a statue any Stastu just a statue
TrixyBlox: 80k likes for the map! Fans: *450k* take it or leave it
Is there a way you would be able to play with friends on this map?
Make a pillager town in a biome
Awesome work, looking forward to play this map with my friends. Also you got me subscribing to your channel so hope you the best! :D
We need the download link for the map I loved it
What............. O_O
I want to play this world
Serious but can you PLZZZZZZ add geese? I love geese and I even have one called Eric.
You should destroy the stairs on the ruined portal a little more
This is gonna very cool map
Next upgrade the snow biome
Will this map be available for bedrock?
The hole time I was watching this I was like Wow He talented!
Surprised there isn't a ranch for the cows and horses.  If the Plains Biome is the starter biome, having horses early on for travelling to other biomes could be a nice boon.
A giant haunted cavern only accessible through the plains biome full of giant spiders n stuff, you should build temples and shit underground
That pillager outpost reminds me of Assassins Creed Valhalla
when u hit 10 million subs, will make another world that's like 4 times as large ?
Welp... This is fuckin dope
"Make sure we get 80000 likes" *gets 450,000*
Cool ... Now make a WW2 map
Wow mojang really needs To add those sort of villages!
This gives me vibes similar to that new Vegas failed mod
good job

Don't add ender dragon add new boss that's op than dragon in somewhere of the map pls
"is this minecraft??" "this is what minecraft should be-"

It look like lane of wano
Imagine if he makes it an mmorpg map that would be amazing
ur about as good as grian. wow
This is minecraft for 100 dollars
Question, how do you film it and editing the map at the same time?
Seed ?
dude im speechless  btw my idea for that world is something like a cluster of floating islands in a biome and you gotta solve many puzzle to unlock a command block which will allow you to teleport there and i think you can make something japanese themed on the island idk the things on the island is your choice
Holy crap I wanna buy this mod or something this is just made my brain go to explode
Well... That like goal was smashed
Bruh this is just fire
Is this gonna be only for the people who paid on the patreon ?
You deserve a nobil peace Prize
Change the end city!
the sheer talent is absolutely insane
Add dragons
How cost this world?
My sugggest is tu ad a AMOGUS reference becuz funi. sus?
If anyone know which apps or software he used plzz comment below
Plot twist: this guy created RLcraft mod
So sad im rubbish at building, and u cant use copy and past on ipad :(
the way that you build these maps on massive scales and add lore to them is just beyond impressive
I love your build style so much, I wish I could like your video more than once
Where's the download? 80k likes was reached.
I cant even build one good thing in minecraft.
Why does it look like creating a map for a fantasy anime
Bro give link to download this pls
I wish minecraft looked like this like oh my god wow
Please include the underground and underwater kingdoms
You should make a movie out of this
This whole new map just took “lonely” into another level
can you make chests with loot in it aswell to really give the zelda vibe
Bethesda deciding to never release ES6 so tricky just building it in his own
Can you try adding costume mobs?
Mojang 2.0 the new Mojang
Adeas: put in unobtainable powerful weapons and tools in special locations to encourage exploration.
Wished you added a giant old stone,obsidian and iron made robo that you can go in to get loot like xenoblade chronicles robot
Bro i wouldn't mind living in this map irl
Imagine mojang actualy add this structures
13:36 The music here doesn't really match the setting and tone of the rest of the video. I'm not trying to be rude just a lil bit of constructive criticism. Everything else was awesome!
Wished you added a giant old stone,obsidian and iron made robo that you can go in to get loot like xenoblade chronicles robot
Imagine Mojang copy this and put it in actual Minecraft and called as paradise island full of treasure but with dangerous mobs and new bosses at each biomes, that would be cool, spawn at random coordinate and in order to get the coordinates for this island player have to kill ender dragon and go to end city to get a map of it with coordinates, new adventure...
I am loving it so far still I hope to see that you can complete the game with this map. Maybe add some dungions in each of the place and one in the mountains where a beast ate some people. Or a strong hold fully decked out so we can beat the ender dragon. I wish it was possible for you to make a custom nether or end.
How the what???
Wished you added a giant old stone,obsidian and iron made robo that you can go in to get loot like xenoblade chronicles robot
Wow, I cant wait to play this map!
This man is wasting his time on YouTube when he can become a millionaire launching his own crazy games

I started with pregananant memes and this is where I end up
The TALENT
You should add a bunch of mods to improve the look of it like decorative mods and mob movement and other stuff just like look up top ten mods in Minecraft and add some of the best ones you come across
Floating islands and/or a hidden grove in a mountain with a waterfall and stalagmites/stalactites
This man is a legend
Jusy imagine if low end pc player play this map.
Include some easter eggs from other video games. A 7d2d navezgane reference would be cool
Wait there is a biom called modified edge boom looks like swamp but green like jungle obviously it's in the middle of swamp and jungle
You could put a dragon in one of the taiga biomes mines this looks dope can't wait to play
Who is La Davinci when theres a TrixyBlox! 🤣🤣🤣
Island looks like moon so I will call it moon island and please release it for TLauncher please
Add Underground monument desert temple jungle temple amplified world and every mode which will make minecraft look like minecraft from 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 infnity century later from 2021

A mosque for the desert church
your video just now inspired me to do more in my creative world, thank you.
I'm just hoping that you will be working on minecraft right now
Are you going to upgrade the nether and make a castle 🏰
😶
Can use make a series name world log number
SEED....NOW XD I can't wait to play on this, it looks sick
BOTW 2 lookin’ great
Do the pillagers still spawn though

The world is insane but can I have a copy of map for android?
Can you give save please
WOW, I have no words, I intend to play on this map once it is out
I need this
I couldn't even imagine building as well as this. You, sir, are the next Grian.
This Guy Is One Of Notch's Sons
Me: Thinking about Naruto
I dont know what you intend to do for the Snowy mountains, but a cool Idea would ba an Icy cavern for this "Mysterious thing"
Why are you understanding and will be happy
If you need any help with creative backstory I'd love to get in a vc and just brainstorm a ton,
woow! This is soooo Epiiic!!!
I'm definitely interested in trying this upgrade, feels like something that the game needed for a long while now
Idk why but you have such a nice calming voice that almost makes me fall asleep. Amazing vid and voice 🙂👍
Bruh mojang needs to hire this guy
Download map?
Quem veio pelo JazzGhost?
You should be the creator of minecraft already 😭😭
Maybe put a ship on the water and add tresure chest inside
16 times the detail...
i dont cnow if you cnow but pillager spawning is placed in generated tower,  when you deleted it, you propably deleted their spawn as well
"remember to get this video to 80K likes"       *laughs in 3,500,000 views and 445K likes*
Why aren't u subscribed already?
When this world is fully finished, someone should use it for a survival server series...
Wow you have amazing talent in building I could never imagine me doing that im to lazy to build something like that but ur builds are beautiful I would love to play this when ur done.
Ma only question is: How much time did it take?
if you add elves, dwarves, minotaurs, and the other fantasy races. this is literally a fantasy world like in a manga but in a minecraft world
How about a war like theres lots of player in it in each biome like a clan that would be awesome hahahaha
This looks amazing, and I want to play it. Great work. +1
Meanwhile I can barely build a house
Big Ark map vibes
Wow... Thats big cant wait to play it
me: *Cries in bedrock*
This man needs to be let on the dream SMP he deserves so much more than 1M subs
This looks soo cool
Just look what it says down there at 6.52
its scarecrows not dummies
Just look what it says down there at 6.52
please make it free
This looks phenomenal. If I have one criticism; try and make the world a bit less flat but that’s nitpicking
After this project can you make a world tree map?
"80k likes"
can you make the videos longer? i think this one could contain more building for example the biomes other than plains
5:45 i wanna see paulgg complete that thing
SUBSCRIBED!
This is amazing. I mean, it's almost 1 in the morning and I've got school soon but I literally can't stop watching this.
I wanna download this map
The plains biome really resembles valheim to me
Is it me or this looks like a good map and idea for a mc rpg type thing. Maybe not but that’s what I think
You look like gajy pajy the flushy hajy from the film lile pordea
What about a cool Pixelmon related map? Basically a map like this (or this exactly) with a modified version of Pixelmon to make every pixelmon available in their respective region (cutting out some of the biomes that were added to later versions of the mod with pixelmarts and pixelcenters and an arena somewhere in the center. There used to be a pixelmon island back in the day, populair among youtubers and some streamers, which was amazing but is very outdated. Would be amazing for let's plays and maybe contests. That could be such a cool project and would definitely create a big hype!
U GET SUB NOW
20,000 comment
Will you allow someone make a youtube series of playing this, I dont have the stuff to get this myself but I really wanna see it lol
In the Snow you should build. A Snow House Like a tent Because some of the People do that And wolfs is mostly always there and Build a little broken water were they can fish
Why isn't this dude working with Mojang
british david dobrick
Can't wait to play this. Best map I've ever seen and would 100% recommend... Great job man and keep up the good work! You've amazed us all
wow 16 million blocks, you deserve my subscription.    can't wait to play the map
He looks like miniladd, who knowsaybe he will be the next miniladd exept no scandal
Will it be free since the video got more than  80k
@TrixyBlox   You should make a Stronghold and customize it like the other natural spawned buildings, It would also be awesome to finish the game itself too! I'd be glad to play this when it's finished! Good work
How good the RTX on that THING????
The sound looks good and relaxing beats
Stunning.
So this is basically rdr2... but in minecraft
IF this works on bedrock...Ohh nooo god,,,   POOOOOOOGGGGG
#VimPeloJazzGhost  #VaiBrasil🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
How about adding something like a secret bunker or an underground abandoned lab in the snow biome? I think it would fit with the "mysterious" aesthetic
How about the nether and end
Eeeeeeeeee, I’ve been rewatching this so many times since it came out waiting for the second video of this, I just got to be patient.       :)
The confused idea potentially sack because jury usually laugh during a female fertile libra. salty, dysfunctional maple
I want to play this. Hope it’s free. Everything in this video is amazing
I'm SO excited for part two!
satisfying
You should try upgrading my sad depressing life next
I hope it's free to download 🥺♥️when it's done
How do you copy and paste stuff?
Is it available for bedrock??
Could you do a tutorial on how you design ur building because this is amazing
Watching trixy is kind of inspiring
Its so satisfying to see this whole thing right infront of me😌😌. I want to play it😬😬😬🔥🔥
If you decide to do modded again try using Little Tiles over Chisel and Bits for one thing it runs better allowing for larger projects, also you can make functional blocks so fully custom beds that function as a bed, fully custom chests that have their own opening animation that you set, custom doors that can open in anyway you like, and so forth
Wow so cool
Bro can't you make Minecraft USA map pls
what 😮
Dude. I know this is a huge project, but I need the rest of the episodes. So bad. Looks like I'm turning notifs on
This man is a LEGEND he created a whole custom survival world while I cant even build a simple starter house
Can we download this map
Trixyblox: I've got some secrets... Me hears Trixyblox say "Mysterious Caravan" Me: Say no more 😎 I gotchu fam
Where blacksmith
ok
“just a little complex” *literally goes sicko mode*
Sir is this available to bedrock edition?
A swamp biome should probably be pretty good to add. Just sayin.
Don’t forget a desert well
Simplesmente incrível
Me who plays in Mcpe Bedrock  :😕
awesome
i cant even create a little hut without it looking like i just spammed  blocks everywhere.
Bruh you turned RTX on all those structures
When I looked at the thumbnail , I thought it was a fortnite map
This is so lovingly crafted. With massive scale builds it can seem much larger than life, but watching this... it truly felt like watching an artist work. This is incredible, and I plan to play this as a small SMP with my friends when it’s finished. Thank you for creating this :)
Um why didn't you add some kind of water source inside the village like they have in vanilla
I cant wait for someone to make a mod that changes every building in minecraft to his upgraded version of them.  Along with the villages structures, add more of his buildings and vegetations. Imagine just randomly walking upto the epic pyramid he built some months back.
11:45 or, hear me out on this one. Instead of the cleric being in the wagon. we give it to the traveling merchant. eh? eh?
A dungeon or something terrible could be added to the village you made. Underground of course.
Some traps  for some interesting  search for the treshure
imagine playing this world in rlcraft, damn
Does he do this by hand?
Nice
Do you think you will do the nether
6:52 dummies you dummies
Release when you're done Convert to bedrock edition So I can play it
Ur Insane
Just a lil' suggestion; when doing the dark oak forest, it'd be great to add broken village buildings as ambiance. Kind of like a deserted town, ya know, 'cause of the woodland mansion. Either that, or a town of illagers.
OMG This is all Realistic And the other pyramids is like dream smp's prison so big map is like Earth
How am I supposed to gather wood without defiling this masterpiece?
I think it’d be a great idea to have some sort of underground structure beneath the mushroom island. A mysterious island in such an auspicious place feels like the kind of area where a villain/King/overlord/something would hide their lair or tomb or something. Plus it adds an epic underground area, which is lacking in vanilla (until 1.17 of course 😌)
Your amazing bro 😎
I hope this is going to work for the Nintendo Switch. We play a lot on the switch
This is so cool
this reminds me of the hunger games bro
Mojang, take notes
We want this map PLEASE😭😭😭
W
Target Likes: 80k Right Now: 440k+  Now, Make more (:)
This is no longer Minecraft it’s 𝓶𝓲𝓷𝓮𝓬𝓻𝓪𝓯𝓽
it will be so good if dream speed run in this biome
Oh man you should put some lore or hint or structure hinting at some bionicle stuff. This island looks a lot like bionicle's mata nui.
This video makes me remember console version minecraft tutorial worlds
Turn on realistic shades mod it will look incredible
Me seeing the tumbnail did he make earth???
The story of the Lost pirates, I think it's a great name for your story like there's these pirates that got lost and they're trying to find a way back to their ship.
It’s crazy how he put this big build in a 15 minute video👍
I'd love to see some form of Underwater city, like atlantis! Maybe you could transform the Underwater Temple into something similar?
(I know this is probably not possible for Mojang to spawn in the worlds) but this is what the Village update should have been!
This is CRAZY OMG:)
Can we play this on MCPE?
Mushroom biome: how about taking a look at the mushroom bits of Rubber Ross's modpack for some inspiration of glowing mycelium.  Would also like to see something like a huge labrynth/dungeon underground that eventually leads to the end portal
“Remember to get this video to 80 k likes” : gets 450k likes. 😂
Ruins
Love from india
In one of the diaries make a reference to villager news and have it signed by villager number 4
woah
yup, just some MINER details😘
Please do or get someone to do a Skyrim  themed role play, that would be SICK
I’m actually in awe, this fucking amazing, I can’t even build a roof that doesn’t look horrible. Keep up the amazing work dude.
Mojang needs to hire this man
Java or Bedrock?
The alluring break only present because flare remarkably intend notwithstanding a enchanted organ. sordid, frightened frightening full fumbling functional mimosa
yoooo if there’s ever a way to port this to bedrock when you’re done that would be insane
Yo, can u make an European City in the tundra or any biome that u want
80,000 likes.... that’s was the goal he was expecting to be a challenge or maybe take some time to reach.... 450,000 likes within 4 days. That’s what happens when you make some the community likes and wants to be apart of.
I'd love to see some sort of upgraded woodland mansion in the dark forest
Bruh, the mustache
Dowload map pls
Sus
Op bro❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
we need a biome re-work for the next big update...
@Mrbeast Heyo new content here
You could add like an ice mine in the mountains Thant’s like an old abandoned mine shaft that’s mostly been iced over or something I think it would be a cool idea
World download?
This island is giving me fanfic ideas.
Wall maria from attack on titan and shiginshina district villiage
If mojang make add all of that in minecraft will be sooooooo beautiful and fun to play
The Mesa biome should also have a run down ghost down far from the large settlement that is the hideout for the pillagers in the region so the player can become an outlaw~!
Mesa biome with dino foot prints and dino remains
can i download that map?
.                                         .                                 Troxa
Make mode for the game it well be new jobs for the villagers and pillagers and new item new mobs for the biomes
...
.
Am I the only one who sorta wants to see a Ewok styled village in the jungle?
Is that wano country?
Also, have you ever thought of building in the nether?? The Nether is a  big place, and you could make story in the nether.
I dont know if you'll be upgrading the nether but I think that it'll be cool if you did a sort of industrial design using Blackstone. A large mine searching for nether gold and ancient debris
i can't... how... ayo i can only make a dirt house and wood house ong help me amazing build. earned a sub.
Pretty plz put a dragon in one of the biomes it will make my day
I think in the frozen mountain area they should add large glacier crevasse and cave networks high up in the mountain- perhaps with abandoned explorer camps  of long dead mountain climbers
This is honestly....amazing.
So rust but... in Minecraft. I like it!
Woah
Once this map is done, I DARE someone to make the Minecraft Movie on this map.
Would this be availabe for both java and bedrock, if so , THIS IS AMAZING
How about this: You apply your past project (especially the underground kingdom!!) to the story and creation of this survival world.
Do 100 day in this world!!
I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY THIS!!!!
u forgot the swamp
Description: 80k likes for part 2 Gets 440k likes.  I am really happy. :)
my guy just took minecraft story mode on another level!
Minecraft Bedrock players: Why are we here? just to suffer
I come from Jazzghost
you look insanly high in this video
You should use this as something like a rough aesthetic outline for an adventure game
I was wondering about the swamp biome and what you could do for the witches hut!
Can you also give a download link of this map for Minecraft Bedrock Edition?
I might be wrong but your pupils look like they’re different sizes, which can be the sign of some sort of problem with your brain, and you might want to get that checked out by a doctor in case it’s something serious
Hytale be like:
The one thing needed to be added is the ONLY netherite mine in the over world  but here's some restrictions! 1# can only be in the, dark oak forest, mesa, snowy mountains, and the jungle. 2# can only have enough netherite to have three full sets of the Armour 3# can only span 5 to 10 chunk's (ps: make sure that everything spawns in the structures and theirs loot like the pillagers outpost)
There is noob/pro/Master builder as a title but you deserve the ultimate god builder as title
I need this map
The police approve of this!
i would love to see all the different villages have a way to trade or something of that manner
Will this be on mcpe ?????
Wow amazing bro
Yo this look like a fallout/skyrim map!
is is so sick
Man even the creepers are going to say “nah this is too much”
Can you download the map
j-jazz?
This map would be good for 30-60 player pvp
OMG
Java, right?
you should make a bridge that the illagers are trying to built to reach to the mushroom biome, that would be realy cool for the development of the story!
this guy should be hired at Minecraft development srs
Tbh.. Cant enjoy vid with that infuriating dialogues
Is this on bedrock?
Would pay so much
I love how he asks for 80,000 Likes but gets over 4x the amount 😂
what kind of mods do you use?
I don't know minecraft took place in Australia
We need more and may you do the taiga next?
80,000 Likes Goal  Video: has 440,000 Likes  *task failed successfully*
Is the other biomes done coz I'm gonna play and watch all tof them
you could build an upgraded version of the jungle temple, with more traps and what not, with the reward containing some sort of riches as well as the start to one of the scavenger hunts you mentioned, or maybe make one of the scavenger hunts take you through one.
This is awesome!!!
Im speechless...
Make this video get 80k likes  Almost half a million likes later *
first time here , mindblown
I'm pretty sure you're the best Minecraft builder I have ever seen
How to download map?
emmmm give a waterfall behind which there is a cave And
Please work in mojang

who thinks that this guy is better at building than grian???
you asked for 80k likes? how about 440K FUCKING LIKES
Make a demon slayer reference in a snow village
You're like the mumbojumbo of building when you talk about us attempting this kind of stuff ourselves
Will the pillagers still spawn at the new tower?
i am speechless. i’m new to this channel and oh my god am i gonna binge watch all its videos
Jazzgosth
Idk what kind of ideas you want but it would be pretty cool to see villages in the swamp and jungle biomes.   Honestly I’m not a fan of custom trees but I get they are necessary for this kind of builds, maybe I would have kept a few of the normal trees around in the village.   Maybe in the spruce biome you could actually make it so the clusters of mossy stone that appear would sometimes have treasure underground them? Or maybe the stronghold could be located in that biome making the cluster make a little more sense   Also in the savanna it would be pretty cool if some of the village houses were floating, because sometimes that happens in the savanna.
This is amazing. Love the creativity. You just earned a subscriber!!!
Looks great if possible you should ad some islands for the other main biomes like swamp and mosh room biome also try and make it possible to get every item and go to the others dimensions and for a crazy idea you can even transform the other dimensions
JAZZGHOST I CAME BECAUSE  OF YOU!
How do I download load this on console ps4?
I am going to play this when you finished I am exited for the bigger buildings and the lore that almost sounds like a Skyrim type story game (without quests obviously) but sometimes finding out the lore through journals logs and other things can be more rewarding and more interesting
Isso é completamente loucura
damn i hope that is playable on mobile bc I don't have Minecraft on pc xD
I want to play this map
this should be added to mincraft, my only word is beautiful
I use to always watch bobros
Tropa do Jazz?
I really can't wait to play on this map can you make it Xbox playable as well? If that's too hard it's okay
you should add in some underground secret bases or something
Play make next plainnnns
You should do the nether and the end once your done with this part of the project, other then that as impresive as always im so excited to get to play in this amazing map!
you are the most talented Minecrafter I've ever seen, def subbing and waiting for part 2
When you realize them clouds are round       👁👄👁

hey if part two is out can someone tag me?
men that is beautiful men. i love it
Oh my gosh he must've been in Minecraft 24/7😀🤚
Can you do a very big tree
imagine going on with your day in a village and seeing a flying man rebuilding your house
Wow..
i think that they should make it so the villagers actualy use the market stalls it kind of sucks they dont.
How can I download it?
Why do i feel he's trying to make a new tutorial world
Will it be available for pocket edition?
This is so cool like wtf
Honestly after you finish the world, you should revamp the nether to have piglin tribes and more realistic like maybe a volcano, revamp the nether fortress, revamp some bastion to make it look as a actual challenge to navigate the nether
Now, imagine someone or a team of people took the world and make it into an RPG world
The crop farm looks like a steak
Mojang needs to generate worlds like this (1.19 Nature & Structures Update!)
my laptop will melt trying to run this 😂
Your actually amazing great job I subscribe and I will play this when your done
It's so cool you can sell this map for a high price but you don't sell this map, it can be the coolest one you made
Can someone reply to this when its available for download? thx
Can you add Yggdrasil, i think it will look really cool
This is incredible!
Hey I don’t have any money on the phone but I’m still working on it and I will send it to you tomorrow
@TrixyBlox How does a Witches hut in the dark wood forest sound? It could have op potions and some hard to get materials.
Can’t wait to play this whenever you release it. I love the way you build and how much detail you manage to put into structures.
Plz finish this
I want you to put strong hold in the mushroom bioms
Definitely worth the like
An underground city would look amazing, kind of like Dwemer Ruins from The Elder Scrolls, but really this is just so amazing all I can ask for is just flowers for all the dyes lmao
80k likes for part two? Lets goooouuu
Am speechless.
To make the cathedral really fit well into the biome, you could scatter a few small scale farms around the plains near ponds. It would also give the biome a much more “lived in” feel
Sir,its been 4 days and u have 400k I think that's enough for u to make it
I think an in depth cave system running through the snowy mountains possibly leading to an fully upgraded stronghold maybe even resigned to look like people have attempted to enter before but met their fate
I come for Jazzghost
Do the hidden mineshafts but don't tell us where it is!
i haven watched the entire thing yet, but maybe add a giant mushroom on the island?
"Should we post a recurring comment?"
I saw tons of minecraft timelapse and all of them was great and decent  BUT THIS MADLAD

Secret abandoned underground base!!!!
Can we pls play this... :)
You are doing a great job.
Wow I wanna download that map now. So that my phone will explode
this looks amazing i just have one concern you said this would be survival freindly what do you plan on doing to obtian natural recorces like mining ones or do you have a alternitave method planed or will yo be making a costom cave ?
Jazzgost alguém?
I need to play this. Is there a estimated time when this will be completed and ready for public download?
omg he is litterly the dream of building everything just looks amazing. The fact that he only has 1 million subs is astonishing to me. Give this man CREDIT!
It doesn't have any ravine l
he made notch look lazy
What version of mc is this Java?
I wouldn't want to break any of the trees and other things like for loot because i'd feel too bad about breaking your hard and beautiful work xd
I think you need to join mojang because you're so good at building
My guy I am not downloading it ONLY because I can’t and if I could I would add like 100s of mods once your done like create and better villagers and maybe a couple others even in just it’s early state right now
Crashed alien ship Easter egg?
Thumbnail : "this is minecraft"  **Worldbox God mode Flashback**
Minecraft more like adventure time now, except 10 different biomes
You should attempt a abandoned house somewhere... maybe a lost villager that couldn’t find his way home?  And you have traveling clerics, but where is the main church or maybe even temple?
Bruh I literally can’t wait
80,000? More like 163,000.
i dont know if i want to finish the video or just wait until i can play it myself. so crazy man!
I'm really looking forward to what you do with it looks great already.
Map pls
can you add a botw reference
Mojang need to hire this guy
THIS GUY  NEEDS MOR SUBS! I love how he puts so much detail and design into his maps with a fantastic Theme.
You see I do things like this on console like huge maps like this only to be forgotten

Its so amazing.no no no its super amazing, thanks for your video
Give this world for download
Insane idea btw, If possible could you make dungeon like areas, like enemy castles bigger than the pillager outposts but smaller than woodland mansions  Also ur builds are really cool
I would play the village mods on this when its complete
Plains biome: Statues pointing at somewhere (chests)  Reference: Onward  Villages: if you break the floors of the houses,You'll get 40% small chests and 20% on big chests,inside the chests have 7.4%/10% emeralds (6 or 9) and 6% golds (5 golds or 7) Reference: none ? (Sorry)  Thats all,be safe ya'll
I need this world..
I think it got 80,000 likes..

You are a very talented builder. I love Minecraft mostly because there is so many different types of builds you can make and make them very detailed. I love all the builds you made and I know how long it takes so you really deserve a lot more than what you have right now. Keep up the great work and I also think you should make a futuristic city which could be basically something like New York with everything futuristic.
Can you include some sort of cars?
o my GOD. bro im just.....  agggghhhh. i wanna say congrats to you for being the only person/yt to get me to sub when u ask. so if that says something.....
can't wait to break every block I can in this world :)
This build might be a reason that minecraft pops up again, and I'm definitely looking forward to all the different YouTubers and strangers playing this world and reviving the game once again
you're really  talented...if i was notch i would hire you straight away 🙃
I think it would be really cool if some were in the jungle biome you added a bamboo forest and some sort of Chinese structure
Can u tranform Geminitays base?

Hunger games style world
This is just......WOW
I wish you could add a mmo rpg aspect of it but I will settle with this massive map/ master piece of a build

This is amazing the amount of talent time and effort  True inspiration to for builder can’t wait to see what you do with rest of the world

Dude I so subscribing I gotta see how this ends this is amazing.
I’ll be happy if there is at least a hidden among us somewhere
Skyrim Minecraft style!
Would it be on Bedrock?
Plot twist: he made this in survival
👌
Mojang should put this in the realms
I can not wait till this is all done. It looks fantastic and I love your vids!! Maybe a fun little idea could be that you add maybe a mine or two? Just around the plains biome, either in the village or near it. If you intend to put the mines in other biomes that makes perfect sense just thought I'd offer. Again looks great and keep up the great work mate!

What are you going to do with the Nether? Or are you just going to leave it the same?
Add mountain with lava in it..
Add a custom nether too
bruh when I watched this video 2 days ago it had 240k likes now it has 440k likes. guess we getting more of that map then xD
This guy is a legend, thats so clever
You should put a couple guardians in
bruh its Oo
imagine adding all of your previous creation to this world, epico
Only thing that is missing is a beginner dungeon in the plains biome that the player can loot earlier on for some great early game items unless this is one of those survival maps that isn't really going to have a dungeon exploration or even underground exploration aspect to it.
Imagine miscalculating a map by saying 16,000 and then saying oopsie 😂 it was actually 16,000,000 👍🏻😂
Can you make a bedrock version of this world please
This is really really cool.  It would be awesome if other popular Youtubers did playthroughs on this map.
Everyone: it's a masterpiece, I can't even destroy the trees-
I wanted to play that island but what is the number or letter of seed 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

And roads for the jungle and snow
And have small towns in the desert like Wild West
You should add like city’s in the cold and plains

This is amazing!
1:28 What's the map building software he's using?
You should probably upgrade the ocean temple to feature a maze of sorts you can only access after completing some sort of quest or puzzle
Plz make spruce buome after this
Wow that is a big map! And it's cool to
A house he normally builds will take me 3 weeks :C
no life
If Mojang see this he will make a update
Dude this build was awesome!! cant wait to see more!!
16,000 and 16,000,000 are very different numbers, the fact that you are sane after all that impresses me
You should put a cave system somewhere, preferably in the mushroom island.
You can decorate the church with an organ, and use glazed terracotta as fancy flooring
Dam this looks so good but just imagine if create was added and actually made the wind mill spin, that would just be so cool.
Make a sky block and make a barn on it with horses and hay

someone should download this world and survive for 100 minecraft days
This should be a pvp map
I never noticed how much the clouds actually move

You have way too much time
am i the only one who wants to use create to make the windmill spin??
Omg
My God...... I'm speechless.... Can this world played on bedrock edition ??? If can I want to play it as soon as possible
Make a secret when you fix the portal the other side has a decorated side
Bom pelo jazz
You probably wont do this, or read this, but a Dragons lair in an abandoned winter castle with an ice dragon would be really cool in the snowy mountains biome.
Can it be  for minecraft pocket edition
Hello guys I'm new subscriber
Poor jungle edge
This is so cool. Great job!
You just came on my page but I'm glad you did this is awesome also in the tiga forest you should make a cave for wolfs

Idea for the mushroom island. Off on a side located near the center have a ‘central’ mushroom. Bigger then all the other mushrooms, the village would go there. The villagers would have chiseled out parts of the mushroom and used it too expand their village.
You’ve just gotten a new subscriber holy shit this is so cool
I’d hope that maybe you or some does a video on this or q 100/1000 days  This must have token a long time
Ok this guy didn't just make a Survival World, this guy made an entirely different game, Inspiration from Red Dead Redemption, Zelda BOTW, FF VII and others, this guy deserves at LEAST 20 Million Views
No because this is literally the best thing ever! Cannot wait for you to upload more!
This is so cool. I'm glad I subbed today.
you should have like cave dwellings, or castles or villages underground as well
you can download the map?
Wowowowoow how can we get ur map????

I don’t know why it it’s so satisfying just to watch someone build in fast motion☺️
I need this please make more.
Reminds me of red dead redemption which make me think of some ideas. At spawn when this is a survival world you should start with a horse. Just feels right. This was one of the best YouTube videos I have ever seen on YouTube
Oh wow, I usually don't immediately subscribe after watching just 1 vid but...here  I am. Love your work ❤❤ definitely try to recreate some ideas in my first ever minecraft village. And definitely downloading the world when available. 😍😍
How long did this take?
A small horse barn would be nice to add in every village for the player to leave or get a new horse
Are you a Lord of the rings fan?
Please tell me you’ll be adding HQM into this. I haven’t found a great HQM adventure map since Blightfall.

Os gringos não vão entender mas vim pelo jazz
Uhh, how the heck did you do this’d.
You should put a giant mushroom in the middle of the mushroom biome
Dig a creeper hole in the desert. Nearby, make a small little camp with a chest and a book. If you read the book, it says "note to self: it has been 300 days since i last saw a creeper. :D"
You forgot the swamp biom

You should pepper most buildings with chests that contain loot, the quality of which should scale to how difficult it is to get to the chests or how important the structure is (like the massive pillager places). Its always nice to see beautiful buildings but having an incentive of chests would give it more life and a more video game feel vs a tour of pretty structures
You are insane my friend 💪💪💪
Do you think's its possible to upgrade the place in the nether the one that seems like a stronghold for this map aswell?
Idea: a boat dock that suggests you sailed to the island.
So excited for this! Can't wait to find all the little secrets scattered around, will the underground be changed too?
I don’t know if you intended this but you should totally add good loot and chests in Some of the structures
is this map going to be avalible?
This is amazing

bro ima be honest i feel like you should add more than one village in the biomes or at least some camps or smth, and then have some sort of lit castle in one of the biomes. idk u prob won’t see this but i’m just saying that’s all i was thinking while i watched

Minecraft will be more realistic because you ! Minecraft must see this !
what a good video
I still dont understand why this isnt standard in minecraft.
Ideas : - Create a tunnel network connecting all biomes.  - Have a biome located in a gigantic cavern (with plants or mushrooms).  - An Egyptian city in the desert. - A viking or pirate village near the coast. - Have a coral reef (perhaps at the intended location of the shipwrecks).  - A gigantic fortress.
I can tell you put a lot of time and effort into this and i respect that
I loved it...after I saw this video as a mcpe player...I liked and subscribed and smacked that Bell button I loved it man....😶I'm speechless
In mesa biome u should make lots of old bone cages of dinosaurs or the old giant zombies

(I’ll edit this over time if I have more ideas) Ideas:  Perhaps a small island (or portion of the mushroom island) that has a ruined settlement of a long-dead stranded individual, where you can find writings of his tales and decrease of sanity over time, with hints of wear he hid his priceless possessions (armor, tools, etc.)  A dungeon of executed criminals (now skeletons) where you must progress and kill in order to get highly enchanted weapons and items.
Imagine chisel the whole island
Hello
Here is all the diary logs (From the map)    *You got Rickrolled*
what if you built the zelda ancient guardians in front of like a castle
How do i download world?
The spooky lipstick intialy paste because colombia putatively hook an a jumbled lion. tasty, picayune plaster
When he got too the village’s I got Skyrim vibes
I subscribed just to see this world evolve and get inspiration to my worlds, great job on the villager outpost, I might copy your design sometime
This guys building skills are astounding
this is so amazing!
I hope this on console too
Safe to say you FECKIN SMASHED 80K... PS: This is why I love your videos man... you are absolutely amazing...
HOW DID I JUST FIND YOU OML-  I-  THIS IS AMAZING HOLY CRAP
Should make a survival playable skyrim map
We have found the one that holds the prophecy
God I wish I had Java edition
That sounds fun! Can we go to it in Bedrock?
(Here is an irrelevant comment) Me: No mobs can grab and place blocks Enderman: Am I a joke to you?
What is the next video
Link please
Wow so cool 😳
I feel like you should switch the outpost tower back to dark oak wood because they live in woodland mansions...
Idea, flooded lab off the coast of the Snow mountains, as a reference to Subnautica Below Zero.
either oasis town in desert, or that one library in avatar the last airbender in the desert plsss
Wow this is amazing I’d like to do a survival run where can I download
Would love to see the mushroom island having the lore that an asteroid landed which covers the island with a infection. Have maybe a couple of research ship with some that had sunk due to the infection
Omg hiw can i get da map pls
I- wha- HOW- like really this is amazing
Have a lost city. A meteor crashed and the city has been ruined
I think you got over 80,000 likes
wow... i have no words for this
I’m glad you have hair now. last time I saw you, you didn’t
gonna play this in VR when it comes out
If someone suggests a dinosaur in this world... I would diee!! Nooo you will make the world fucked up this world isn't a jurassic park!!
If only I could play this on bedrock edition..
Id have some log piles by the outpost and some log stumps near by. Maybe remnants of a small woods after it was harvested.  A raided farmhouse nearby would be good visual world lore too.
I can't believe u did all of that alone, I should install this map.
I really feel like this needs mods and more then one person working on it ngl
I think it'd be cool to build other religion prayer building in the other villages. Or multiple religion prayer building in one village
Does anyone know if I can get a world download on an Xbox one?
I recommend making the mansion on the taiga biome where it spawns like the main area for the pillagers
pls do part two soon i loved this SOOOOOO much UwU
Where can I find the link to the world download? I'm just at 2 minutes and I already am excited! :D Looks freaking cool! :D
oh my god why do i want to play it just from the intro
Some one has a good gaming chair
The hanging cloth wessely interest because tax unintentionally weigh beneath a nebulous turnip. standing, last oak
Hope it’s in mcpdel, wanna download this on Xbox.
I feel like my dirt house is gonna look a little shoddy next to these
You are amazing
If you possibly could, could you make it for bedrock if you haven't I don't have a pc and just wanted to ask I hope you see this
OMG This is amazing!!!!
80,000??? Likes? NO MORE!!!
Idea: A single underground orb.  (i love random ominous orbs)
are you adding a stronghold? also maybe you could have a floating island of some kind and make it look like its come out of the ground
This guy is a legend
Are you going to customize the End a d Nether too?
You should add graveyard to the Minecraft maps
Do another episode
ok cool, but did you know that most deserts are just about next door to lush jungles? so... technically, the two biomes that were on opposite sides of the map shoulda realistically been right next to each other. but hey, its minecraft. do what you want. however its just a wuick tip for those looking to make a realistic map
that's it. i was waiting for that tipe of project.  Congrats
You always blow me a way With your videos man
wish this was on bedrock :(
i just wish that in this map exists a amazing history!!!!
Can't believe David Dobrick made a Minecraft channel
We will watch your career with great interest.
this reminds me of a hunger games arena but bigger
I really wish i had a pc so i can play on this😭
Reminds me of red dead
Hold up. You don’t have 69M?
You’re so underrated wow You deserve more recognition
Release this map pls
It would be really cool to turn the pillager outpost in the plains into a lighthouse and create a harbor below it
Wow this is so impressive I cant even imagine how long it took
Twice the size twice the... Room! This is like the minecraft version of The Elder Scrolls Oblivion O_O
Pls can we download it
do part 2 yaa!
Something really cool you can possibly do, in the desert area is to have like these like weird statues and when you dig down there much bigger.
Looks like the millennium falcon
wow...
Why not making a server of it?
Breath of the Wild is my favorite game so I’m so glad that you used so inspiration from that game! 😃
Where is the next video to this
Reminds me of Wano Kuni map from one piece
oh dude i cannot WAIT for this to be done and watch various people lets play on it. got damn these structures are good!! XD
This is looking SICK! Can’t wait for the finished product to play!  You should make an area in the water that (in the lore) a nuclear warhead was about to go off, so in a last minute attempt to stop it, the villagers moved it into the ocean. This made the area around it uninhabitable. (A bit clicè, I know.) you should also add coral reefs in the ocean.
Put a secret temple in snowy biomes
dont forget nether and end
I got an idea what about like things you can ride like tigers or cars or something
some kind of volcano or geographic formation or something dope to represent the heart of the island
You could make a  "underground temple" full of traps, and I mean it, traps EVERYWHERE, even if you dig around it, still traps. Make it really hidden and deep underground, and in the center make a secret room with gold blocks and a chest full of emeralds, diamonds and enchanted things. Then add clues all around the map such as books saying where to find the next clue and the final clues telling you what biome it is in and what area it's in.
why dont you make it to be some gamemode like horror mode on the forest
Sky island above somewhere? Takes all 7-8 parts of a map to find through all biomes, and nether biomes. Id say above  past render distance above the plains
DAMN 1 person can defeated the big microsoft team WOW
;-; i just wanna rp in this map now
Hmmm I looked everywhere for part 2 I think he forgot or something
I         IM         suBsCRIbEding
Idea: a place with a large dilapidated structure with a chess containing materials and scaffolding in the front, encouraging players to rebuild it and maybe even put their own spin on it.
You’ve earned a subscriber lookin up to watching more of your vids
This is gonna be cool when it’s done.
You should add some huge caverns under the plains, with various entrances mostly from the mountains but maybe a few of them from the other biomes, add a huge abandoned underground creature city with some abandoned mines, maybe somewhere in them there is a secret chamber filled with gold blocks, a chest full of treasure, like emeralds and some diamonds and enchanted things. traps everywhere, and a puzzle you can solve by collecting clues from other places on the map that will help you find this room.
this is fuckin awesome man i cant wait to see this project finished. Are you thinking of doing the nether and end too ?
This is what Minecraft would look like if it didn't have a random generation
This is beautiful I really loved this cool place ! I would really enjoy having this and exploring all the different areas! And i like the pillagers place it gives it so much more normality and it makes this dull looking tour make since loved it!!!!✨✨
you should add a Madness Combat-like areas.
Wano?!!!? o_O
WOW!!!
This makes me emotional, it’s beautiful, the breath of the wild and all ist perfect
The only bad thing about this video is that it ends.
is it just me or is he a spitting image of old Minecraft YouTubers? all of his mannerisms and everything makes me think of him as well. We have to protect him! I will definitely play your map when it comes out and I won't take no for an answer!
I hope he copied that village and put it around a lot more in that biome because nobody wants only one village in a biome...
shader + the map = rpg server mc
ohhhhh you should make a dwarf gate/castles in the moutain biome. It would be soooo coool :D
I seriously hope its one of those java/bedrock compatible servers
I just want to say ur a god at designing and building
he should make a giant, world tree esque (I think that's how you spell it) tree, right smack dab in the middle of the jungle biome when he does it
Now do the nether
do the bioms actually rain and snow like they are suppose to and all the pilligar outposts spawn pilligars etc?
Already watched this but it’s too good
This was recommended to me and boy am I glad it was, subbed and hit the bell keen to see what he does next! Can’t wait to play on this map 🗺
This is amazing, why have I never heard of this guy?? It's a crime
Aw man, this makes me want to make a minecraft world. Great job as always!
I'm not sure if I should watch this or not I'd love to play the "story" portion but I don't want to already know about all the locations also TB you should make an entire area in the nether too (although it would be much more time consuming or difficult than the overworld part)
If Mojang watches this and doesn’t say “Let’s hire this man.” They’re stupid
How to download please tell me
too many ads
“Minor” details BRUH
Will this be bedrock friendly?
It kind like the fortnite map in minecraft.
Werewolf, GoatMan, and wendigo in Minecraft 👌🏽
You should make a secret underground village accessible by a few caves in the mountains with rare villagers that trade really valuable items.
U should try to add a plane wreck/crash in the jungle
Could you put that on the Minecraft mod hub
oo very cool idea loving it so far :)
All of this kinda reminds me of Eragon idk how to explain it.
SHADERS!
Will this be available for console
You should add hot air balloons to the mesa area
Why does it look like Pac-Man
he only wanted 80k likes damn guys we blew this shit uppp
so thrilled to see the end result. im sure that it'll be magnificent
If you can could you bring it to bedrock too for your console viewers?
I really like this! Good luck on continuing the project, I'll be sure to download the map when it comes out!
i want to do something like this but i cant access world painter :(
looks like an ARK map , without the dinosaurs
I imagine pillagers sitting around a campfire singing campfire songs
It would be cool if he made a custom mod and texture pack for this map.
For Bedrock too please
Idea: use the Minecraft storymode soundtracks for different biomes and parts of the story to add more theme
If you loud up this map i gona play on it. Sorry for min English.
Part 2...? pls...
I WANT TO PLAY IN IT
Mojang should take some notes
He said 80.000 likes, that was 4 days ago, and 5x that amount
you got some major talent dude.
Culd you add Atlantida or some underwater stuff dungeons or something like that and also you culd add mythological stuff from hell to the nether
Is there a seed we hit 80k on I mean 400k
That structures are so cool, but on my view minecraft has a lack of game mechanics, it would be so nice if you make some custom maps to play whith mods. Great video!! you have a new subscriber from spain :)
This is absolutely legendary. This is as epic as the project making an 1:1 scale minecraft earth map. This is map I would absolutely play Thank you so much for this project And congrats for 1 million subs dude!  Even tho I don't know you, I can say for the quality of this video, you could have even more than a million subs
You should do a tree, but the Keebler elf is baking cookies inside
i can't even begin to fathom how powerful ur pc must be
This is cooler at the End or begins I think 💭  endddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd!!!!!!!!!!!'!!!!!!'!!!!'!!'!!!!!!!!'!!!!!!!!
This reminds me so much of Wynncraft and I love it
So, let's say you sent someone the story, would you be okay with them writing a book from a player (explorers) POV 🤷🏽‍♂️just an idea
I would actually want to play survival already in this! :)
Something is wrong with your eye, dude
A small boss for each biome
Minecraft needs to hire you ASAP!
i want this map.
this is the thing i always wanted
Bro, you are crazy
Put in the wild west town a back to future secret
Plz
Anybody els think that the knocking in the music was irl
More more p2 p2
It would be cool if you put some ice mountains in the snow biome, like ice king from adventure time
You better hide an onion somewhere
Just me or did anyone almost fall asleep watching this
Please make a huge underground mine in the snowy mountains, somewhat of a Lord of the Rings type dwarvish build. Would be sick!   Really just make any sort of big city.  Keep up the amazing work! Really cool!
Just saying its pretty unrealistic for the olains villagers to be vegetarians it would make much more sense if they used the open land of the plains for cow pastures it would make sense if the jungle tripe where the vegetarians as they would have leas access to meat and more accessible to fruits
Hey trixy is this available on bedrock
Asks for 80k lol gets 420k
To “talk to villagers” where you can make choices that would affect the world. EX tribes in jungle (you can help one and kill the other) and so they will actually move and take their land.
You should add a woodland mansion
Sad it's only on your patreon
How long did this take?
why doesnt he work at mojang for this stuff???????
I want to play this it looks really good
This is just AWESOME!!!🤯🤯👏
Hey bro you should make a warriors guild
You should have like custom vanilla mobs *bosses more rly) and dungeon like structures, they could maybe drop custom loot, would be awesome!
block by block tutorial?
I have no words for it, THIS IS INCRIDIBLE!!!
will the nether be upgraded?
A giant dungeon sorry I haven't been on in a way I've been gone
That's a lot. I was wondering if you can upgrade the caves
Lowkey giving me skyrim vibes
When is this masterpiece coming out
what about a custom nether and end? sort of like a DLC.
This video kinda makes me wanna play minecraft again with a map as beautiful as this lol
I would love it if you did something like this for 1.18!
Very good!
The simple lunge univariably divide because captain dfly join like a offbeat racing. ablaze, mysterious driver
The fact that mojang hasnt hired this man yet.. (sigh)
this man made minecraft 2
This is amazing
Do a let’s play in this place
13:57 I just had an idea behind the outpost. Try building (or don't. I don't mind) a bridge invading the mooshroom biome if I'm right
You remind me of jeracraft but like way better
420k likes what
Mojang should just quit there job and let him make the every third lol
I just have one word...... wow
Its like an ARK map... but a good one
Use create mod to make windmill turn
2:15 love that train. Love all steam 🚂
The thumbnail burns my brain
Wow
Should do a colab with jeracraft
Wow just wow
absolutely phenomenal work mate
this mans channel is growing so fast
What did he use to custom the map?
This looks so amazing! But it seems rlly extra and overwhelming. Great job I love it but Idk if I’d play it in survival because it seems a little too big and overwhelming. I’d definitely check it out in creative tho
it got 420k likes. NOW GIVE IT TO US
Dat shit look like it belong in fortnite
an under ground rail road to get around the map
Could you mod it and make them randomly generated?
idea:  New type of caves
Can I download this on ps4?
@PaulGG
ravinessss
Is this gonna be available for bedrock pe
Is this map available for ps4 I want it this. Is a cool map keep the grind going man great job don’t give up
yo, this looks seriously amazing!! i'm excited to see the final product once its done
Can’t wait til you can play it
Great dear see how creative people like you present in this world
You could creat a epic gear set for each environment so when you become the top player there you get it by the gods.
Herobrine temple PLS
simply amazing
You got my like and subscription, I’d love to make a survival series on here when it’s finished! Already getting some cool ideas for it, phenomenal work on the design and structures. This looks like an amazing adventure
I WANT TO HAVE THAT WORLD
Yess! I love this!😍
I am so impressed. This world is already super cool. Will we be able to play them on PlayStation?
you forgot swamp
I really hope you can include elements of the cave update in your map.
Insane project
The map somehwat looks like from the show ampibhia
your building videos are the equivalent of a painting from bob ross. its just beautiful to watch
i want to download it :(
I am very impressed keep up the good work
It would be awesome if there could be some plugin custom mobs to act as bosses
Very nice project and extremely relaxing to watch! I’m looking forward to playing it someday!
What’s the seed?
a giant underground glaciar cave in the snow biome
The thing is, even if you make a good looking map and design structures for more realistic looking world, it would all be the same as playing old minecraft unless you programme/mod it according to your words and description like jungles in conflicts and a yeti
Can you please make a secret piston door that reveals the yetis home?
i bet the previous video was the water monument for this map....
Imagine this, instead of villagers. Real players.
Trixy... you're incredible
Idea: In the middle of the plains biome, you could build an incredibly large tree
Yo Minecraft, hire this guy
How do you download it
"I spent 100,000 days in The Ultimate Survival World."
Only one house of yours is better than 10 of my worlds
Do you have any plans for the nether or end? Or doing a separate video on revamping a end city or something?
İ thank you take one 1000000000000000000 years
this guy rlly said *pathetic* to the vanilla buildings and just upgraded them fully
Can we get This map?
lMAO i cant even build vanilla structures good
This with shaders my brain *breaks*
Wow... thats the best map ive ever seen. How do you do this so good?!  Wow. Just wow.
Question will it be available on ps4 tho
This is nuts.    I ain't got words for this man.
Very good builds but how do you do that
You should make a hidden conspiracy for the map for more story
Make a small stable of the planes land and for the rest of the map
how.
Get this man into Mojang
I want the world pls T.T
Omg this is like west world... This is insane dude wow i love kt
Pimp my biomes
Man said 80k likes it’s been 4 days and has 450k
can u make to downloand this map?
Yo bro we have more than 80k likes  give the download now
You should make the remade structures a mod!!!
This is incedible! I cant wait to play survival on the map :D
I will be grateful as you give a link to download the map😉
MOJANG NEEDA TO HIRE HIM
Minecraft should hire hime easily
No one: Me looking at the miniature: Amogus
he looks like david dobrik
Your a legend you deserve 10million+ subscribers your amazing at building
I think you should include various missions within the talk of traveling merchants... kinda like the wagon idea you had but all around the map.
Imagine if we had access to like—20 of these, completed. So much content to enjoy.
Imagine if it was in survival
Minecraft in 2060
Awesome I wanna play it so bad, I have an idea tho. In the snow biome add like a statue of like herobrie or a yeti
This will be so crazy and cool also we should do more transformations
Wow what great creativity
This is absolutely incredible the patience and skill you have to do this is insane I'm so so looking forward to be able to play this
You can use commands to make custom villagers. This could allow for cool trades and also backstory.
will it be in bedrock edition?
Ngl this map would be perfect for a MMO or a RPG. Or both ;)
Please Build NOTHING in the desert 😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂
npcs :0
Nicely done👌 and it's not even finished👏
Maybe add a mages tower in the tiaga biome in the village
This looks like a Bionicle Island AND I LOVE IT!!!
You should add a swamp biome in between the dark oak and jungle forests
Maybe ad a moving thing somewhere
I hope there will also be some hidden factory build somewhere in the final product :)
.... It's beautiful....... I've looked at this for 5 hours Now
First time watcher and wow... you're amazing ahah +1 sub
gun shop in the hot biome
Amogus
One thing I'm hoping for is that the mesa and/or savannah are very tall/extreme, and maybe almost difficult to traverse so that there is a bit more progression. Love this :)
costom made nether???
Where do I download it
Amazing map but if you made the portal stairs a little more cracked
This is truly incredible, well done! Absolute work of art, is there anyway to play this world on the bedrock edition?
How can i play it
This is the first video of yours I've seen—Very excited for more parts. I could see having alot of fun in this world.
It is going to be great! I'm actually pretty hyped "I want that" ~Bobby Duke
1.17 probably: soooo... when ya gonna upgrade it
minecraft rtx
A.I players please
Is there a download link for Minecraft PE?
The lazy time comprehensively zoom because romania directly offend under a amazing divorced. abaft, synonymous antarctica
You need to build something for the ravengers in the piliger outpost
Just found you and boy am I sad I didn’t find you sooner
Make a big kingdom and abandoned castles around the map
This kinda reminds me of dayZ
How long until we can expect the next part of this video?
You can turn the plains biome into a kingdom with walls and a castle.
Dude you should make a server like hypixle or something like a mystical rpg server I would definitely play it
Cus he was to tired and havent sleep for 23 month no food no water just build
when will next video come out?
I'd be cool if you added a custom nether to the world 💫
You make me remember my old friend do half of mincraft but past away😭😭
What the seed
Put ravins
Question: will this be free to Play? If Not I'll be donating smth to you this is incredible :)
Smith?
im not even joking tho.. just watching this made me smile so much more. UR SO TALENTED!!  I have an idea tho -  Maybe u could upgrade the nether or The End?? but overrall this is BEAUTIFUL!!
A cabin in the woods in the forres biome
i saw this on reddit the other day
for the ice biome church look at the castle out of narnia
You should make a little swamp biome next to the plains village and have a witch hut in it.
He should work for mincraft
looks like his face is being deep faked
Will this work on bedrock?
Wow, this builder is just incredible
Him after building a huge 16'000'000 block world : This world was so easy and so chill tu build Me after building a 100 block house on a flat world : OMFG it was so FCKN hard and so long !!
Yo teeth yellow
Love it
Why minecraft doesn't look like this art
will this be f2p or patreon only?
Now villager houses are cooler than my house
I couldn’t play this in survival I’ll be scared to break a block to ruin the masterpiece!
This is where I want to go after I die
How to play this map
Good God....
this is epic!
EPIC
Name wild West town Auga Fria
Minecraft be looking at this video with their heads held low lol
Hwo do I download on ps4 pls tell
U should add a creek
12:09 "Mimic" ...... Huh I think ya mean mock lol.
does this guy want a toothbrush
im excited for part 2
Bruh my guy should be hired by Minecraft devs
link mab downlod
im just gonna wait till this is downloadable
I'm gonna play the sheet out of this map
Subscribed
I hope that I can get it on bedrock
Holy crap dude, this looks amazing. I'd pay money just to play this seed. Also, I think you  destroyed that 80k like goal 🤣
yo how much time did this take
Question: is the nether and/or end going to be upgraded like this too?
I have an idea, how about a bakery?
Me: how much likes He have? I want the map The likes: 414k Me: oof its a old vidio The vidio: 4 days ago Me: yeah... where is the map?
I amaze how you manage to do this, I get a headache whenever I build for more than an hour.
This is absolutely crazy but also are you going to make this a bedrock map as well as a Java download
are caves spawning still?
It's not on bedrock is it
how long will this take im sold already
I want to start building big builds like this, so i wanted to ask which world edit he uses
super sick dude keep it up!
I can just imagine Notch seeing this and making this the minecraft 1.18 update
Better then a documentary
I can’t imagine the amount of hours that were put in this video
pls lemme play on this world..
dude i really want to play this
I AM excited! This is so wonderful so far and I hope to play on this HUGE map! >:DDD
As soon as it's released I'm gunna play on it
:() "sheads tear"  to those beautiful villages and portal .
This is every Minecraft player's dream update.
Hopefully the bestest well structure wont be forgotten or have its beauty stolen
Only, WOW
Wow so amazing! 👍 Good job
Imagine this with 1.17 cave generation
this is the only reason I'm buying vanilla Minecraft.
You forgot the beetroots- But when I get java I'm actually gonna download it
He asked for 80k likes and he gets 400k for a part two 🤣😂
You should build Dracula’s castle and a world tree somewhere. That would be just awesome.  I’m so amazed by your idea! +1 sub 🤩
Add dinos and a volcano biom and an asteroid impact  biom and put the dinos there
you should upgrade your thoothbrush
Great world but only problem is adding all these buildings gives no incentive to make your own bases/ farms
i wish actual minecraft was like this
Oh my god I can't wait to play this
I thot I was good at building until it watched  this video
Yo bro I just wanna know is this for bedrock or Java or both? Bcs im a bedrock player. I want to ask do i have permission to use this map and tweak it into Rainimators Rain animations world? P.S. Beautiful build, want to play as soon as possible (if in bedrock). Also imagine if a speedrunner speedrun this map
So cool😎
You should add a lot of your old mega builds
imposter from amung uss
first video i see, love it, maybe u can make a small end island in the overworld?
this reminds me of rdr2
Yeah I think you went a bit over the like goal bud 😅
I’m not good at stuff is there a way for me to download this on Xbox?
I think it would be sick to intagrate a volcano somewhere into this build but it might be a bit late
Minecraft should hire him as a developer
Idea: Make an cathulu reference undground on the small circle island part of map
yum
The pillaged bases remind me of sheikah towers from botw, you should add some Zelda references
Will play on hardcore all the way
You deserve like a billion of subscribers!! This was INSANE 🥵
Just WOW
I'd love to see an epic shrine at the spawn point. And this is pretty cliché, but have you tried adding something like key gathering quest to open a secret chamber to geet a special treasure?
this is so freaking cool i cant wait to see the finished project!!!
Amazing
You should make a secret final boss
In the Jungle You can build an Maya Temple
On the last shot where it shows the raid tower finished and the mushroom biome you should build a giant rope bridge going over from the raid tower to the mushroom biome with guards and all of that I think that that would add amazing texture to that area of the map. And that it would also show that if you want to go to the mushroom biome you have to first get through the raiders camp. Also amazing job on the plains biome look freaking awesome.
do you also think that its a little too small for survival map
Do a flag on the top of the tallest snowy mountain
Put in a volcano
Holy
When he said that he made wagons for the cleric (since they travel around) he could place them around in the world
New subscriber and I find this amazing and so just breathtaking. For u to do this must take so much time.
WOW!!!! You just gain a subscriber
A dock would be cool,with schooners brigs frigates and maybe even man o wars
This is amazing!! Seeing the plans for the mesa biome made me want to see a fully realized Westworld map in minecraft :D
you just instantly earned a sub    i have a idea: a woodland  mansion (upgraded) and then a trone for a custom boss? would be rly cool
If just i were able to play this BEAUTIFUL mode. Really realistic, also i can’t cuz i got ps4 and i can’t use packs or mods :(
This guy needs to brush his bottom teeth better
Wow… this so amazing.. I’m inspired to try this myself, but I know mine will be nothing compared to this 😅 you definitely earned a sub from me! I’m excited for the next episodes!!
12:50 the final result reminds me of Notre dame in Paris
The wonders you can accomplish in Minecraft are truly amazing
GIB MAP
Hey guys! I found Philza's teacher!
Dude this is soooo cool!!
80k likes and we continue, my man got 5 times more lol
Another idea I have is have a secret futuristic biome hidden somewhere that can only be found by solving some stories made by the jungle tribes like I mean they have story’s of the wither called idk the Black Death of three heads with a secret coordinates in them I know it’s a bbbbiiiigggg sssssttttrrrrreeeetttccchhh (big stretch) but please
I would like to play it ....can you make it a bit harder survive too  Traps in the world will also make it interesting....like obsidian maze or zombie room Like more mob spawn rate or more hp to mobs or mob raids which you can't skip
Omg this must of taken forever.. u are so talented 😭😭😭
I Can't waite to download this and play it with my friends DAMN, your videos are AMAZING, your creative work is so amazing man!!!
Can the camera stop moving so much,its making me disy, for fcks sake theres too much
This is amazing lots of work put into it this is better than I can even imagine any Minecraft world but you forgot something for the librarian and also you should post that pt 2 soon!! I'll be sure to like the video and watch it!! Much love keep it up bro!
Just :o
Your builds are great and your videos are really high quality but I would really like if you could show your builds without shaders too. Doesn’t have to be the whole video or anything of course! Just maybe the end bit where you show off your build could maybe have a version with and without shaders. Keep up the great work 🧡
if u finish, u should make this map a smp, like TrixySMP. that’d be cool
could you add a blacksmith to the village
That is so fking entertaining ...wow😱
You have the mind of a developer!
where is the world download :(
Imagine an SMP on this
The flashing in the map making scene made this hard to watch.
Pls this is amazing
This is what Minecraft was meant for

This man’s dedication
LOL IMAGINE HAVING THE BIGGEST GAP UNDER YOUR TENT ON THE SIDES XD
*time to make this into a dnd adventure*
hit me up when you can download.
Big church in a small village? Man you made Poland in minecraft
Make a costume stronghold
NOW THIS.... deserves a sub. prove me wrong.
How did you do this? I want to make a map like that
can you do part 2 please?
I'd love to see the end upgraded, like alot. The end after the dragon battle is so boring and empty. It needs more stuff while also feeling minecraft-ish. Like take some inspiration from black mesa's xen for the end.
Wow, man your incredible
There should be a big city in the center of the map, a place where the spawn point for the map is located. You should have a large underground cavern system, maybe with a Pillager city located within it which contains the End portal. You also need to make a custom Nether map as well, with custom fortresses around it.
I’m late but I have a idea you should add some broken houses with pillagers in the plains to have the pillagers more realistic kind of
What if the player spawns in a shipwreck as if they where a traveler that washes up in a new land?
*respect+*
Ideas:  -Make a water fall  -Make a mine (Somewhere near the Mountains)  -Make a wood cutting place for a village  -Make a ravine
More! Please give us more!
I'd love to see the nether changed so that one of the fortresses is upgraded into a nether castle. Including a courtyard, armory, throne room, etc.
k i subbed now drop that world plzzzz
Dude you should add an abandoned dwarf mines in the mountains!
they should hire this guy!
i want it
Its very good map but i dont know dowland How ı can dowland ?
How many days in real live does it took and how many minecraft days
Can I get this on my tablet
This with shaders would be absulotly insane 🤩🤩🤩
What’s the seed
Noooooo! Im on bedrock edition
Just I tiny miscalculation you know.
If i play the map Can i beat minecraft and get to the end?
How could I get this on Xbox?
The builds are on a whole new different level, I’m getting intense chills just by watching this can’t wait to play with my friends!
The only thing I dislike about this is that it wasn’t made like a year ago, so I have to wait to see the other biomes and the finished result
Bro, you are a Beast what Is This? This Is So So amazing.
This man has ascended past our mortal realm
you sound like Tommyinit
Great
you forgot the blacksmith
This is better than minecraft :D
Maybe for one of the treasure hunts its like a diary of a pirate with clues in it, but you can only solve it if you get the incomplete 2nd diary of that pirate
Sooo good I love it
This is some serious dedication damn
Wow that’s crazy
This should be #1 trending
I really want to play it
could you do sword art online
"Mesa" with a hat... is that a warframe reference?
This isn't everything.
This is content
This is what humanity used to look like.
How about a cave system/underground structure that can only be accessed through an underwater entrance?  There could be clues/maps leading to it....
Mad respect
Ima subscribe to you
Insane!
I hope they create something like and this very i hope you can give me file for this map
This just made me realize that most structures in minecraft suck.  I wish the villages would look at least somewhat better in the original version.
Were gonna do a little trolling on my friends when this is out.
Use a frozen 2 theme for snowy biome
I hope the creators of minecraft see this
This looks amazing!  Really cool idea.
did he do an interior?   Also, I think just the village is a little less than he promised to upgrade. I do not calling it bad in any way! But if I were him I'd add some... activities like ruined caravans or even caverns,  lakes, ruined villages, ambushes and some technical details like placing a bed and an alchemy table in that trailer for clerik since you want to do a playable map. I also recommend to read some literature about game design. Maybe you'd get some ideas from those
Mister where is the blacksmith
Please start brushing your teeth
For me that is the island of lego bionicles
How will mining work??
The village should have a school
I cant wait until you finish it
Holy shit. You're back.
you needed to put like secret words in every place that all of them combined creates a treasure map to the ultimate treasure, you are a great builder,  i like your patient
Not gonna lie the farm it look like a meat 🥩
He’s so used to building huge he even said it’s difficult to be restrictive
once this map is done. im definitely taking the fisherman's house  because that looks pog
Truth be told, once I get back onto Minecraft, I am *FULLY* willing to play this map once it's finished. I finished watching the vid, and the very thing I can say about this video, and therefore the new plains biome, is.... The plains have ascended. Ascended into the incredible levels that I truly love and care for in this game! I'm REALLY willing to play this when progress has finished~ I played Minecraft as a child, and I will be revisiting my childhood at full force once this map releases~ (I read the pinned comment. SIXTEEN MILLION BLOCKS!?!?!?! THAT IS A TON!!)
This is so beautiful
UHMMMMMMMMM CHOW😁🔫👈👁👄👁💅
Give the blacksmith some love 💘. Other than that Amazing job
Hey I have a question is it ok to maybe use it for an Roleplay weich will be uploaded on Youtube,of course I will link you in the Description.But it is still not fully decided if I do that but I just wanted to now if I have the permission.
HOW TO DOWOLNOLOAD THIS MAP
Only recommendation is to make sure this works for the caves update!! I wanna play the map when that update officially comes out if that’s possible idk anything about map building but looks amazing :)
a dungon
ah yes hay barrels
Even without the transformation of the structures i would already wanna play on it. Once it releases i will definitely start a YouTube series on my other account
MAN I WISH I C CAN PLAY THIS MAP IN XBOX MINECRAFT
Do a rick roll easter egg in some biome
download link for map?
Please upload it and make it compatible for Xbox and ps players too that would be awesome , I would play 100%
When whill it be redea
impressive
Include some yetis in the
Bro the plain biome is simple but soo clean and nice
The thumbnail: AMOGUS
I’m pretty sure someone has already said this but in the snow biome, make a Mount Everest theme mountain
Yo?? This is actually sick man I’m excited to see more, subbing for sure!!
This is amazing
7:29 That's not minecraft That's assassins creed origins
He is so good
This is fkin amazing. Can I play it on Xbox???
How people have the patience for this I'll never understand
Minecraft mata nui confirmed
If you aren’t watching this this way 👁👄👁 you’re doing it wrong
Is the map complete and ready for download?
I think it would be cool if in the snow you could put a giant ice tree
Are you making another one ?
"Get 80 thousand likes" Rookie numbers, have half a million
This is so cool. You’re an amazing builder!
It would be pretty cool if the villagers had a better AI like they could talk and explain what happened etc
i can't even just bravo SO GOOD LOVE THIS CHANNEL
Island looking kinda sus
Mojang take tips
Hi Trixy I have a idea how about in the dark oak forest have a medium size tower full of brewing stands fingers Crossed 🤞 you do this please and congratulations on 1,000,000 👁👅👁    :)
Idea, secret tunnel throughout the world underground like a subway
Hoppning for some cool traps
One one down (plains)
Add a volcano
I wouldn´t even destroy dirt on this map, every house i built would look like sh!t compared to the map
When the thumbnail is sus 😳
Am I the only one who thought the church was a castle in?
I think you should add an anime secret in a cave
someone gimme that seed
This is amazing
I can describe this by one word WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW
simple idea:  1) random pirate ships and merchant boats around the outside of this build 2) a scientist was testing on some cows on mushroom island and accidentally made mooshrooms 3) the mountains contain a tribe of aggressive villagers who have been at war with the pillagers for century’s 4) giant dragon skull laying next to a half broken end portal in the jungle  5) random campfires and tents set up all throughout the plains and desert 6) a random treehouse with the name being “Trix’s house” as a little easter egg
I’m amazingly impressed, you are a extremely talented builder :)
me and my brother saw 5 abandond villages in one map
you miscalculated the size and number of likes you would receive :p
Wow thats amazing 💯
can u play the map?
How I download tho
This is masterpiece of Minecraft
It’s hard to believe that this is true, but I know it is
ok this is actually the greatest thing i have ever seen
This is stunning, can’t wait for the next biome
Add a crashed plane in the plains
yeahh but like it makes me not want to watch mine craft if you do all that design stuff ngll
Wow... this is INSANE. Great work
add air
“Completely alone... with the help Of my girlfriend” But in all seriousness i will definitely play this map.
I NEED TO PLAY THIIIIS NOOW
holy shit this is fu awesome
80k likes 😂
When he releases the map, someone should do a let’s play on it
he said 80k likes  it got 400k
Ideas: make a grand castle in the plains with a small village
Personally, I would love to see an abandoned castle or something of the sort
I always liked the idea of having a small mining town situated underground. There could be a bunch of mine carts connecting all the buildings and sprawling off into different mining areas.
who is the seed?
is will this be available for bedrock
I want this now it’s so cool, plus make version for both Java and bedrock, Java should have the giant caves and a spot for wardens, plus since they are so strong make the wardens have good loot hidden where they live, keep the caves for bedrock, but maybe think of another idea to replace the wardens, maybe a abandoned mine with lots of traps and stuff, also make each area where you can mine unique, and only certain ores will appear in some locations, or loot, it might look really cool if you can make the underground go into the sea occasionally or make underground lakes and stuff, and maybe make a area high up in the sky full of end islands as a endermen farm, give them chorus plants and small end city structures, but it has to be high up so it’s difficult to find
why cant this guy work at mojang
You earned a subscriber off this one vid
You should include some other upgraded structures that you have already built in previous episodes.
Only the plains looks beautiful... I cant wait for playing it! What about adding a golden fleece (Greek Mythology) in a tree just as a little easter egg
Nice world, sadly I can't play it :(
Does these structures have chests? And if they do, do they have loot inside?
Man asked for 80k likes, got 400k, nice
This guy shouldn’t even have to ask for subs. Just look at this!!!!
Plus i reccomend also having a download for bedrock when completly finished
I’d love to see a viking village in one of the colder parts
Bro I want to play in this map please give me the link
[TEARS]
Kinda wish I could get it pocket edition
Add lake town to the sea from the hobbit
Less than 5 days and already 400k likes good luck on part two
Am i only one who thinks that the island looks like land of wano map from one piece
bro turned minecraft into red dead redemption😂
I just subbed, love your vids
oh woah this is so cool
oh nie. Czy to śnieżny koczkodan w górach śnieżnych?!
Why don’t clerics sell wine
Hey! That is absolutely amazing. But if you made it 4 000x4 000 blocks, it’s not 16 000. Try 16 000 000
Mojang notice this!!
"Great, now transform farlands..*
is the download coming?
I absolutely love botw and this will be so good. I saw a guy named SymmetraMainbtw lol snd he made awesome suggestions. I hope everything goes smoothly and I will be able to play this
that village look 1,000,000 times better
OH MY GOODNESS!!! This build looks SO COOL! I really hope we can play this when you're finished!
Make Hogwarts somewhere (near a forest and a scottish lock(I think you can so it in the spruce thing)
I have a few amazing ideas that I think you would love to build... Atlantis and an underground crystal cavern
dude the minecraft staff must hire u
Escemo
The world looks like a healthy meal
The Devs would be proud
ADD LIKE A BETTER CAVE THAN THE CAVES AND CLIFFS UPDATE
This is brilliant
When will it be finish
Are you making a map of thiss
yay
Can you do this for Minecraft pe?
Idea: huge nuclear bunker in the snowy mountains
Mojang need to hire this man😂
It would be really awesome to see a Zelda style dungeon or a mysterious mansion in the snowy region
the pillager outpost looks like its straight out of skyrim
Cowboys
download linK?
This so cool. I wanna play this! Is there a seed code for this? I wanna play this!
This would be awesome for a legend of zelda modpack!
80,000 really we beat that bye 300,000
My good sir, you have greatly mistaken the concept of minecraft. You have kindly earned my dislike    Still looks cool though
Would love to see a version of this map with just the custom trees and no custom buildings for us to make our own stuff on this world!
I hope this will be available for console some how
IDEAS:  -waterfall in the middle of jungle -yeti mob in the snowy mountains -monkeys -under the mushroom biome, a mushroom city -sun god boss in the pyramids -in the jungle, native american villagers
im getting huge read dead redemption 2 vibes
could i play this on playstation when it comes out?
Could you ad smurfs to the mushroom Island
make an under ground city
I think using inspiration monstat and liyue from genshin impact will look good
This is awesome. Just a small suggestion. Maybe add some small abandoned buildings with loot so theres more to explore. Like in breath of the wild with all these ruins
I hope this becomes a available Minecraft seed cause it would be perfect
I feel like a hidden underwater city would be cool
This is insane, I would recommend using the tektopia mod on this map. This mod is all about bringing the village alive (having actual working villages with jobs and guards) this will make it look like small kingdoms! Absolute awesome map with out without the mod!!
Dream has to do the next manhunt on this one
You should add livestock in the villages
Idea    Area name:the Island of the last Idea: on this Island it is a house but if looked  closer the Island holds a sercet of the past and the resson why they or he or she is there
I'd add more rivers and lakes to the plains to keep it less empty, maybe a small mangrove swamp.
I seen this on Reddit
ok so imagen he does all of this   and then the files corrupt
Wow..... This is just..... AMAZING!
some caves maybe dungeons?
You should do a mosque for an alternative place of worship. Muslim architecture is really cool!
*THIS WOULD BE A GOOD MAP FOR A MINECRAFT OPEN WORLD RPG BROOOOOO!!!!*
♫︎
So uhhh what’s the seed
is this amongus map
microsoft should hire him
Its just a dream to play this world im subscribing rn

Trixy: we’re gonna keep this simple  Also trixy: builds a freaking camp

you know what mod works with this map rl craft would really fit
He's so talented
Your so so so sooooooooooooooo Amazing
I would really like you to add some cats cuz they're a lot
I think igloo villages would be cool- also with ice fishing
Grian been real quiet
Make a rickroll in a diary
W O W
"accidentally making the map 2x bigger" my friend, thats no accident . making it 2x smaller would
Can I ask you a question? Is there any ore generation on this map, just like in the normal minecraft world? It would just be nice to raise the tym.
Fortnite chapter 3 map
It hit 80,000 likes
Minecraft devs: right that down
this looks like hypixel skyblock
I need the download too this I would love to make a hard core seires with my friends even though I don't have a channle....
You should build a massive labyrinth underground and perhaps add some infected caverns where slimes spawn.
What can i say except"HOW DAFAK DOES THIS LOOKS SO GOOD DAMM 🤯"
Imagine converting this into a Pokemon map for use with Pixelmon  All of the villages turned into towns with gyms, an elite four maybe in the mushroom island, etc With the biomes set up properly, it could be a super fun experience  Or just a mod which adds this general structure redesign to vanilla generation, to give the game a more detailed feel
I will not be able to play the map becouse I'm not from PC but if you will stream it on your channel I will watch it
you should joint the hermitcraft server for season 8
Wow!
My dude, release this, now.
You may could add some old tiny castles
Can u make erebor in one of the mountains
Will it be on xbox
Mojang wants to know your location
Maybe have several of the big portals connected in nether for easy nether travel
You are bad you are illumination
how do I download it
holy shit this is so good, i remember finding this map in the subreddit a few days ago, didnt know you were a youtuber
this is insane.... btw can i download this for bedrock edition?? *
its the island of mata nui!
A snow castle would be soo cool
This guy would be an excellent voxel artist
Maybe a hidden room where random names of people in the comments, and smaller mc building channels.
This guy is a god      Nothing else to say, he’s just a god
M hey I'm on xbox now could I get it
Can u wait a welk or so then do a tour of it for the people on bedrock edition pls.
Pls give world download
We need this guy to team up with Mumbo, Grian, and Smallishbeans, that’s gonna be the best collab of the decade.
hoping we can it play on bedrock too :(((
omg How beautiful it is
Mojang developers should do that
Youtube........          GIVE THIS MAN A TICK PLEASE HE DESERVES IT DUDE JUST DO IT
Dude, you are way too good at building it's unbelievable.
The picture to the right in the thumbnail reminded me of settlers from catan
What is the seed?
he got a little more than 80 thousand likes
Wouldn't it be cool to see Luke the notable play on this world
I'll be sorely disappointed if there isn't a master sword hidden deep in one of the forest biomes.
How do people have the patience to not instantly delete the world the time they exit.     That was the worst spelling I have ever done-
I am hitting the subscribe button for this, like dam
where can i download this map ?
i want this map, please make it downloadable
Idea : You should add something for the protection of villagers like some walls and iron golems in the form of guards or even some traps to defend the village like tnt cannons, arrow dispensers or even a lava pit hidden with dirt which will open when a pillager steps on a pressure plate You should add a community house for all the villages in plains biome
Eeeeehhhh seed? Pls!
your  builds are insane!!!!
Can you pls publish the map
this is awesome Woahh
Please include the custom dimensions too so it’s just like vanilla
Where is the  LAVA POOL?
I... actually really want this map, wait up, this is probably one of the biggest Survival builds i have ever seen
Adding missions would make it a legit rpg game
The villages and pillagers. *_New acheivement!: Pilllage and Village: City madness_*
Lake Tricxy : Island Blox Mt. Bloxty  Canon mines : trexston town : rail roud canion : (the train stations) stations Miors : Mary's station : Rial roud Central Scavenger camps (the piligers)  (The main island) Blotrix (brocken portal) status of the entrence  Piramide of life THE BIOMS  Plane lands Canion Rex : Canion's wrath The snow shets Sand lairs The deep wods Big trees forest SOME OF MY OWN IDEAS If thers a boat dock il name it : Cetral entrence : Jeremys port : Monatak entrence (sorry for the Bad gramer)
You pretty much made a rockstar world in Minecraft, nice
Is it out yet I want to play I want to film a video on it
Pillager fortress in the snowy biome
I have one question........ Dude how
Can't wait to download
İts a perfect but why not share why not seed why not dowland map 😭
I would pay for this implemented in cooperation with Mojang to have a intricate backstory, like an add on world, this would totally bring Minecraft a whole new life that I definitely want, great job man 👏
you forgot the ice spike biome
The 1.5k who disliked were just jealous that you build better than them,......
This is sooo good!
No....these are so Random ans bad designed...its an cool idea and projekt but its ugly.....
If you actually finish this... I think it will be the greatest Minecraft survival experience to day, unless I missed something.
download???
Hide a volcano deep within the mountains with a hidden dwarven mine where you can find lots of rare ores
This is lit 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Maybe pirates around each biome
"80k likes"  the video 4 days later with *400.000* likes
The zealous oyster separately preach because pull informally serve above a unequaled august. perpetual, cagey pisces
Mojang Workers: WRITE THAT DOWN, WRITE THAT DOWN!
I'd love to see a Tatooine Easter egg, it's not too far from regular desert village, and an El mos cantina would absolutely slap 😊🏜️
Bru this is sick and did he actually build all of this block by block
Bro tbh I don’t even wanna watch this full video because I already wanna play this when it comes out and want to go in completely blind lmao
80k likes nah fam we’ve got you with the 400k likes lol well deserved that was fricken amazing and I love the idea behind this survival world it’s gonna be so sick
You should make a little swamp somewhere in the jungle
it could be a seed for technical survival
same MandJTV
AMONGUS
This guy is sooo talented
Its a awesome proyect, I hope play this map with my friends 😁
If all people would be vegan, the environment would suffer and the law of nature would be broken. Of course it’s a waste of nutrition and DNA Information, because we are predators.  God gave us animal. We just shouldn’t eat it every day, Amen
Is there any way to play this on xbox? Or is there a seed?
Bionicle islands Vibe.
This is.., amazing. I just found your channel, I plan to stay and play this when done and also learn tips and stuff about builds
Can u give ur world to me to play?
Your Building Skills are Insane, Good Job
Can you tell me that how can i play it 🙃
It's better than mojang👌👌👌
Imagine trying to raid it 7:30
soooooooooo cooooool
boompastic
All i have to say is...                  Battle royale!
so excited to play this , iv been looking for a good stroy to play but my pc cant handle any adventure mods
I like to think that the bell on the library is like a school bell
well, i subscribed for the download so keep me up! :D
Imagine when he sees this world corrupted 😂😂😂😂
This is java isnt it?
You should add cave systems that correspond to the biomes they are underneath!
So, basically this is a "How to make your own adventure game"...
https://youtu.be/HarGD9rvFPA
When I heard the music for the finished plains biome it immediately made me think of Limenade.
its amazing how how someone can build like this!
Omg so cool! I really wanna play itt but my pc wont let me paly it because it would be so laggy thst it wont even load the map :((((
This is..fiiirrrreeeeee..this is very beautiful world i see him in my live in the minecraft!plz completed this things its very beautiful!
Does the world have a normal underground
This would be so cool I can’t wait to play it!! please add a secret underground mine that could be connected to one of the villages/villagers stories that would be Epic!
dream has to play on this
You could add a massive tree in the center of the map that represent the tree of life and include secrets and magic in it and some destroyed or abandoned castles
Holy snap, insta sub and thumbs up im so excited for this
Something that you should try would be to make landmarks and buildings from breath of the wild. It makes sense because you said you were using it as your inspiration for the plains, but the size was too small to add too much detail. If you were to build it in a custom world as big as you liked and add as much detail as you want
80.000 likes xD, you could have said the threefold
This is beautiful, too bad Xbox is gonna miss out 🥺
That's just amazing. Hope this get's the recognition it deserves.
add a massive c shaped mountain in the snow biome
Skull Island maybe to the map?
Idea: (BONUS) Have the edges of the map fall off like in the Discworld book by Terry Pratchett
Dummies, you dummy
2:58 Imagine having a girlfriend. Couldn't be me.
I’m really excited for the finished world, but I don’t think my computer will be able to run it!
100% Will play
Looking at that amazing village, I can only hope it has enough iron golems to protect the village from all of the mobs that spawn, and pillager raids.
Damnnn can we get World download link 😅😅 btw amazing video🔥🔥
Could you transform the oceanic monument into something like Lovecraftian?
idea: Make secret castle in sky with traps and secret roms and cools towers :D
You should add some kind of collectible from each biom that can unlock something when the player has all of them
Amazing
Idea: Add a aged/ancient vacant ICE and STONE castle (perhaps think of college of winterhold in Skyrim as inspiration) to the winter biome. I like to build them in my maps and I am always happy with how it turns out. 🙂
Maybe you can make like hard boses in this map like a zombie boss endermen boss and more you can also like add more items that are not in minecraft like a spear gun and more these are some tips hope it helps bye  -WALL-E Petregraff
I bet this guy won't stop on just this island. Nether, End... Heck, maybe far lands or Aether? If it's the ultimate, it should be ULTIMATE!
I actually think that one day minecraft will really look this amazing.
Mans really made an rpg world in minecraft. That’s actually epic
You should work for minecraft :)
I love this project and I am very exited for the world download
So.. in other words, you have no life. No Girlfriends. No Job. No nothing.  :)

Omg...I'm excited to download this map
I have no words it looks like middle earth
I need to know if there's a way to this on console        I MUST PLAY THIS
Idea: A lost cave network in the snowy mountains where either a monster lives or an underground miner tribe.
An under ground civilisation/city
I cannot wait to play this map oh my god this looks amazing
why can i see dislikes on this video?
You need to be in the mojang team
How bout in the Wild West biome if you make a train and railroad system what if you make a bridge that has ether not been finished or that has been destroyed but not directly connect it to the railway for aesthetic. You could even put a few blocks of tnt near the destroyed bridge to make it look like it had recently been destroyed. And possibly for mine-shafts you couldn’t a thing where they pass through the canyons through tunnels in the lower parts of the canyon. If you don’t mind I could make a little sketch as an example, but only if you’re interested in the idea. Just reply back if you want to.
Is this Gonna Be Free
How do i Download the map? I love tour videos❤️😀 keep up the good work
This is the coolest fucking thing
maby a ufo or a secrite army base or a crashed space station
This is absolutely nuts. Well done! Is there only one village in the plains?
A momment of silence for bedrock players because they can't play this
When the world is sus
I subbed
anyone else subscribe 34 seconds into the video? Just me? Ok... beautiful builds btw!
This looks just amazing. I'd love to make a server with this world if thats cool with you
That island looks kinda sus
I say you should have a big boss that players to fight in order to gain more xp then the ender dragon.
where is link?
Who would do such a thing to dislike this video? Those 1.4K people: 🤪
I'm surprised the mooshroom island isn't just a giant mushroom with smaller mushrooms on it
You should make a mushroom village in the mushroom biome
In village you forgot blacksmith
Try add an secret underground village to savana biome And something like A Temple in centre of jungle village JUST ideas🙂
You should do the nether too
I’m glad there’s going to be a Mesa biome, I’ve been to Moab, and I love the mesa in both games and real life.
You should be in a season of Hermitcraft i think you would do good
This is by far the most insane and incredible thing I have ever seen someone do on minecraft, please keep it up and keep doing these videos! I never comment, like or sub, but you sir earned my respect and I made sure to do all 3. You are AMAZING
fortnite map?!
Give the Mushroom island some sort of Aztec-like god that's a brown mushroom
I need to do this sometime
Idea  Make a mansion somewhere.
Hello what is the software or site to use at the beginning of the video to create a personalized minecraft map?
This would be the mmorpg game if you add mods for mission for player to play and I have so much idea to tell you more, but I think you wouldn't notice me.. so, I just hope you like my comment
Can you play this
6:53
Mood af
the windmill though
dude you should make this a mod. like not anything changed with Minecraft itself, just replace all of the current vanilla structures and world generations with the incredible ones you've made here
Litchrally
How to play this
🤯
this reminds me of horizon zero dawn, with the old destroyed builds being ruins of the old ones, and the villages being home to to all the tribes
minecraft should hire this guy
So when can this be downloaded cus i love this
the minecraft villgers in this world: anyone wanna buy my house?   villgers elsewhere: how much bread you want, i got 2
I’d love to see another one with the same map and everything, but a few mods.  These mods would be things like: -More potions -Villagers like ‘Minecraft Comes Alive’ -A few more mobs like scorpions, fluffy highland cows, and more -Furniture! But not loads, only a few like chairs, fairy lights, cabinets you can put food in (or even cookie jars!) -A few more foods!! -Working boats you can build with materials! -Different trees such as Sakura trees, berry trees-generally harvesting things.  And stuff like that. Don’t go overboard with mods, mod packs that have ridiculous crazy mobs and that are just not always fun.  Good luck if you do go on with this!
Can you play custom map with mods ( Forge  )?
Mans just made Minecraft 2
nobody: me seeing the thumbnail: *sus island*
How many hours did you spend making this?!?!?
sheeesh!
Estaría bien que convirtieran este mundo en un mundo descargable
Can you give me the map?
Need this on mobile😭
Gimmy more
Idea: Maybe add something like a "center of the world". Its like the nether but with much more fire. And you could build a gigantic skeleton. This could be a monster that once inhabited this area but died somehow
Create a download word
U can make trade paths connecting all villages. U can build there abandoned carriage,  travellers camp etc.
Make a part two now trixy and your family will be safe...
I love how he doesn’t give up if I was him i would have give up on the 5th building i made
you should make this world a modpack
Your work is truly amazing! You did a marvelous job!
What is program name
ITS ZELDA BRETH OF THE WILD IN MINECRAFT edit: nvm just saw he took inspiration off it
12:17 first time he writes something
The  five adult reversely happen because insurance symptomatically radiate across a vivacious accelerator. next, handsome grip
That's a nice boulder-Donkey 5:12
Boomers: Video games cause violence! They are horrible! Trixy Blox: *observe*
when will this amazing huge world available?
Absolutely love these kinds of upgrade videos. Subbed, and look forward to the rest of the series!
Will I be able to play this on bedrock???
well i think you should add like a tribe in savanah and make it a "warrior" tribe i would say  Btw good job! i would never do that with all my time! I hope you had a good time making this!
Really hyped for this project don’t burn yourself out
Idea :  a delorian hidden in a mineshaft like in back to the future
Imagine playing this with the better villagers mod
First time I've ever seen this YouTuber and damm this is some amazing work I can't wait to see more
You also can do that with the "Chisel and Bits" mod :D
I think it would. be cool if you could also update the igloo to be a bit roomier, and add a bigger basement.
this is hella cool, and as you wished for a suggestion I can give you one! you did say that this isnt really a normal survival kind of thing and damn i can see why, so i think that taking into account that you said stuff about breath of the wild inspiration, to somewhat take from that i would think perhaps a starter area that the player can spawn in? my mind thought about it in comparison to the shrine of ressurection or wherever its called, but the idea shouldnt really be limited to that. like jsut generally a plain little area that the player can start off in, so that the player can still have a barebones little shelter to their name even if they dont want to cut down the pretty trees that wont grow back the same way, and jsut want to explore around peacefully! i think it would really be a vibe to have a tiny little home to spawn in, and evenif people want to build on the map, regrdless of the screenshots taken they can always remember the little beginnings whatever they built there started from which i think is cool! anyways wether this comment is even looked at or not i cant wait to see what is coming next to this island
This project is absolutely beautiful, no wonder it got 400,000 likes
a witch village would be very cool as well as a kind of enlarged fully connected cave system
I Am Waiting For Its Finish I Will Download Itttt This Is Such An Opppp Bro Imagine I Got A Heart From You..
... I alredy want this map this man is talented
Will it be on Ps to?
Damn, subscribed!
Mojo needs to hire you
Ugh you made me subscribe because I want to know how this evolves
For the plains, make some more river’s that run down the plains hills from the mountains and into the ocean so the villages can have “Authentic” farm land
This is heckin awseome! Really impressive! Take my subscribble!
WOW you blown my mind away 🤯
Now this is something I would love waking up to
What do you think about making a railway system and make them compatible with the Create 0.3 mod? It allow us to ride fully functional trains :O,  or atleast add an abandoned railway you can follow connecting some hubs :P
Dude... You have so much imagination! Can not wait to play the map! Good luck on the future!
I love you as much as I love the subnautica devs
The loutish flat geographically pop because stew worryingly peep unlike a bumpy motion. tangy, innocent screen
With how it looks i would take over the pillager outpost in the plains to live in. Entirely cause of how it looks.
That is AMAZING!!! I can't wait to see all the island upgraded ❤️❤️❤️
I actually think ur the worlds best Minecraft builder
I don't want to be an asshole but the village wont work unless the villager beds are 32 blocks from the bell
idea: make a giant sign saying subscribe for one of the treasure maps
Bro, you deserve every single dollar from your work and even more! This is absolutely insane. Damn I wish you work someday for Mojang.
Yoo I did this before just not as good
DUDE WTH UR SO GOOD AT BUILDING
Congrats your making a minecraft RPG
-Swamp

Me:**looks at pc** Also me: Why are you running  Whyyyyy are you running
i was so proud making a hut that i so called house
Man I wish I had Java Edition!
It’ll be really cool to see near built up areas, some fallen/shopped down trees and even some tree Stubbs
Me: watching the video wanting to play mind craft also me: trash at building
youre magnificently good at this, i can tell you absolutely love the game and love to build, and its really amazing to see someone doing things this wonderful in the game to share with the world
This is so cool but so thorough that I’d get stressed out if I missed anything while playing
we got 300k more then he asked
Imagine this being a MineZ map
This may be another level, but I think you should definitely have a series of mines and ravines.  Definitely don’t want to ignore the underground!
The Skyrim vibes are uncanny
Make this a mod
make a ice castle
You should make a horror map #ideas
I- I just wanna play this map sooooooo much
Imagine if each Minecraft seed was custom made like this
Just strsight respect
I feel like Minecraft should add a biomes update
you are the best minecraft builder i have ever seen
ya know, why not a few sky islands?
It got a little more 80.000 likes
i want play that
I can’t wait to play it!!!!
Desert biome mosque hype.
This is so sick dude I can’t wait
you should upgrade a section of the nether as it could be used to play the map with mods like tinkers construct and mark it in the description of the map/video
I would like to go on a hunt for the best equipments in the game, and it would be nice to have some places will can only travel with elytra.
Anyone knows what program he is using ? :)
You should add a cave for a yeti in the snowy mountains biome, similar to the monster from starwars that Luke fought right before he had to sleep in the tonton
I wanna play this so hard
I need a version for bed rock version cause i have a shit laptop.
Where can I download this map?
Wow your crazy!
Ur builds are insane !
if it's going to be a survival world, you should upgrade the nether and the end
Oh I so wanna play this world when it's done. It looks dope
Will this be available for all platforms or just pc
You really should add an underground cave thats enormous and has some secrets
Where and when can we found the map?
:00000

This is amazing, you are so talented! Consider working for Minecraft!
Alternative title: "Rebuilding Wynncraft"
You should add custom items and mobs to add even more detail.
I hope you finish this soon!!
I AM SPEECHLESS

Will this be in bedrock edition too
Will this be on both Java and bedrock?
Make the red guy in among us but make it extremely hard to find
Make a home for the iron golem

This is insane, it really does remind me of BoTW especially with the different biomes. I cant wait to see the what you do next.
I got motivation to play Minecraft now
This should be in an update after the cave update     PLEASE GET THIS GUY TO WORK FOR MOJANG
I love it 👍👌❤️😍 it’s amazing and I want to get it
You should have made this a map we can download or make it a server
I would love this on bedrock two
I have an idea maybe you can create the titanic in the ocean
Make a a ded Village in the snowy mountains
Ideas: -Fortress for pillager outpost -Treehouse village on the forest -Otherworldly fungus on the mushroom biomes
I hope your channel reach 💯 millions sub😁
You should really add a medieval city with a wall around it in the plains
just like your underground kingdom video you could also build like a ravine village
ooh i saw you on reddit... Nice job !
When the Minecraft island is sus
For some reason the farm looks like a t bone steak
If he makes the train track scene in back to the future 3, (in the mesa ofc.)  i get a cookie
bro i cant wait 4 him to drop the world download.
Can we get the link to play it
Please please please release this this would be sooo sick
Who have clicked on Bell icon to see next biome
Amazing
wheres the world download
You should build a pillager mansion
wow
This video is better than lofi radio
This is actually super cool, but I think it would be a little bit cooler if there was another Broken nether portal somewhere in like a secret jungle cave or frozen in a glacier, but still this is super cool!
I just discovered his channel and I'm glad I did
another suggestion you can also build a deep snow cave temple deep within the mountain range it
I can see the pain in his eyes
When you build a game in a game
Make a server pls you op builder
Hi I found you vid I love Minecraft builders so I subscribed I think you should have the ocean monument as like a under water temple with not a lot of rooms and I cannot wait to play the map
hi trixy just a suggestion you can even upgrade the end portal it would be so cool to have a maze like end portal
Maybe add like a Pirate base in the shipwreck area and the story would be that they took over the cove from villagers and you would have to go beat them and free the cove/docks
What graphical mod are you using for the water and sky/lighting?
it's only 99% perfect cuz you didn't made a dreamSMP or hermicraft reference BUT you spoke about Bob ross so I only took 1 pourcent
Guys he just wanted 18k and we gave him 488k, I think he might continue but not sure tho...🤔
looking like a ARK map xD
Wow
We Need A Tutorial For All Of The Structures Like Village,Pillage Tower,
This just amazing
Holly frick
Hey Trixy, I was wondering if you could build a Mosque in one of the biomes? It would be very nice if you do.  :)
you forgot swamp biome
Y'know i think it's good to like adds mosque in desert instead of church and the houses from sandstone
Please finish this asap i need to play this map
How can we download this map
BRUHHH UR INSANE
A castle
This is just magical
Great survival map so far. Can't wait for the download!
Maybe if you go to Mesa Biome when you find the mineshaft you will unlock fast travel to the two biomes next to it
The true oil totally rhyme because niece acromegaly search except a worthless hen. delirious, sudden fortnight
you should make a house for the wandering trader, like a cave in a hill with random treasures
Was thinking I wanted something like this to download and play
Can you somehow customize the nether?
where can i get the map?
Just speechless!! Owsam!
Would you make it compatible with 1.17 ore/underground generation and new Sky/Void limit ?
Wow
Its amazing
Dude that is some masive projcect. The world looks gorgeous!!!
I like it!!
Suggestion: I think for your story you should a like a person who spreads all the news to different towns/villages around the world and maybe a something about like them in a shoot out and how he defended himself.pls get this to 500 up votes and he has to add this to his map and story of the map
you should add some things in the nether through the portal
Where can i download ://
Wouldnt a village like that probably have some form of wall around it IRL? It wouldnt be anything crazy or huge but given the world they live in it would make sense they would make at least a basic wall for themselves.
Your one underrated YouTuber...
You need to add beetroots to the farm!
OMG this is like the thing youve always wanted to play. I’m fking SPEECHLESS
zęby byś umył xd
This is truely a work of art, please continue this epic project :))
Underground dungeon!
jesus the like goal got obliterated
Where is next video?  We definitely broke the like goll
i have an idea for the snow biome u should ad a structure that looks like a stronghold but modified wwith a secret room that has a boss and the reward is a powerful magic stone...... you dont have to do it but its yust my idea
Bro your world you can share?
What I think would be really awesome in this world is if things could regenerate. In normal minecraft, for example, you could loot a village, but then you have to move on because theres nothing left. It would be realistic if there was a trick so the villagers were able to add and remove items or 30 minutes (or one minecraft day) after removing every item in the chest new items appear. And especially since this new village is pretty massive compared to the original villages, and because it's an island, so you're limited to the same number of villages. It would be cool to come back after a couple minecraft days and find new items. And the same for trees. Like for every three trees destroyed, one regenerates. Just an idea, but would be a nice touch.
great vid u should built a 100 day map for forge labs would be sick
I would....LIVE as a human in this world man
Totally gonna play this when it comes out
I can't explain to you how beautiful it is.  Why does it kinda remind me of the starting village in sword art online's most recent season
wowww!!!! sooo cool can we download this map on phone pleaseeee?? <3 <3
Would this be only for Java or Bedrock?
400,000 LIKES BABY!!!!
Literally this is epic u r the best builder
Mantel outer core inerr core
mushromm temple [hidin]
wait what about the end or nether fotress and basions
Idea: Make  mushroom biome bigger and add there a a village with a Red castle
I have an idea, make an entrance to a cave next to every village and and pillager tower, or at least a short distance
One piece wano map Hahaa nice!
grian is hopping mad someone challenges him
idea : add a loging town :)
I want to play this so hard
This is going to make me cry🥲
This is mental 👌
Hey where can I find the download link of this map
make a woodland mansion in one of the bioms and transform it!
who else thought the thumbnail was the fortnite map lmao
Among us
Wow the persistence.. Is something i would never have
how many working hours did yoy spend on just the first half holy hell
Maybe an ancient dragon shrine in honor of the dragon? Somewhere in the.. Dark forest or the mountains?
Can’t wait to actually plays this
You can take ideas from the map structure of horizon zero dawn
how do i download it
Japanese village???
My first reaction😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
rogue lineage be like
Okay now this is epic!
This is absolutely fantastic!!! I cant wait to play it!!!!  The only critique I have (sorry if it's nitpicking, I mean no offense, you're and amazing builder) I would make some parts of the staircase on the nether portal deteriorating and destroyed.
What about stronghold
Vegans be like: 9:24
Yes this really is like breath of the wild. And i love it!
I honestly wanna play it when its finished
BRO This looks fucking LIT HOLY SHIT
You can add yetti big cave =))
Just imagine how much time and dedication this is taking him to make this  Also It would be cool if you could add maybe something like an abandoned observatory in the snowy mountains
VOLCANO!
WOW! You're amazing.
Why TF I watched this video ..... now I cant wait for entire island!
The elated plasterboard basically learn because armchair peroperativly shock as a jumbled valley. whimsical, nutty poland
Imagine how crazy this would be with mods
Hekn mad lad
Watch this man get hired at minecraft hq
I can't wait to download and play it 😆
You should try to add custom mods for this world, like dungeons, combat, mobs, exploration, villages and villagers, basically just add realistic mods or rpg based mods
Suggestion: make a mooosroom tribe village
how about you add in one of the biomes a castle ruins
Hope its for Bedrock Edition too
I hope he makes a Jungle Temple with all sorts of traps and maybe get a pro redstone engineer to make a trap that in closes walls or ceiling like something from Indiana Jones!
bro where is that map link so we can play it???
Omg you should make this a mod and name it (better biomes)
I assume the people 'down-vote'ing this video are all bitter Minecraft developers/modders who are just mad they didn't think of this first.... cuz this is pure Minecraft goodness right here. Mojang should buy this from you and include it as a standard world generation option
is it just me? or does that kinda look like the battle pass.
i hope MOJANG will watch this video
Can you make a link to your map when finish pls
How is this world looking flat because it fell from heaven
only true ogs know this is lord of the rings in minecraft.
a cannibal pillager village in the jungle XD
i would LOVE to play on a map like this omg
Omggg do the taiga biome next it’s my favorite biome 😊
I can’t wait till the next episode!
This is truly epic but in the large oak tree maybe put a treehouse in one
Guys what do we do to join on this world this is so cool
so is the map downloadable?
Can we play this on bedrock?
I want this map soooooooooooo much, keep up the good work
Respect to this guy, liked and subbed.
I love it I want to go there I want to go there I want to go there invite me to there
Include the Eiffel Tower
App name that created map??
there's no way not a single piece of this was not inspired by wynncraft, absolutely incredible
This is amazing
Awsome project! Maybe include a swamp in the Dark Wood Forest and build a spooky witch house.
I cant wait for the world download!!!
This is insane!  Can’t wait to play
What about a small swamp biome between the jungle and plains biomes?
*OK HERE ME OUT*     wouldn’t it be cool if there were different tribes according to the biomes, possibly many different separate tribes in one biome itself.   if anyone saw the show *the 100* they would understand
I really wish I could have this on PS4
This needs to be a server.
This is epic
I WOULD LOVE TO DOWNLOAD IT NOW!
Imagine adding a consert hall 😂😂 that would be incredible 🤣
t
Does anyone know what program he used to paint the map??
Add more than just the default animals to make it more realistic like snakes and stuff like that
Imagine playing rlcraft on this
Game theory I found your next video
Suggestion; build a road to connect each village
This would be the perfect world for an open world game like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild!😁
Imagine this world with mod Create
Would you like to share what world painter app you used in your videos please?
Wait, what are you gonna do for the nether
Amazing, You are a real artist.
This really makes me wish I had a gaming PC so I could get this. Too bad I only have power for Bedrock
minecraft get him work PLZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
My guy turned minecraft into an open world game
ideas:  -bosses in every biome (for example in the plains, there will be a king slime which will drop lots of experience)  -a destroyed pillager outpost in the remote jungle biome  -crashed plane with resources that can be found in the desert biome  -rare “meteor island” with a meteor crashed inside it and inside the meteor is a few netherite ingots  -giant anthills that if you accept the quest from the ant queen you get lots of royal jelly (this feature will also be with the bees)  -tiny islands you can make your base on with trees that drop coconuts  - a mysterious ice castle in the snow biome  - an abandoned pier/fisherman house with mysterious bite marks on the wood  -quests from villagers and other npcs   -giant shipwreck with drowned zombies all around  -mysterious hut in the middle of any biome with a diary about herobrine..  -old dragon skull in the plains or desert or snow biome  -underground abandoned facility under a jungle    you dont have to do this but these are suggestions :)
Ur so good! U got my sub.
Amazing dude! I saw your post on r/minecraft and was absolutely amazed!
Add a secret giant trap
This deserves a like👍
You should add a custom modpack for it
This is gonna be so cool I’m so exited to play this!
The outposts look so much more intimidating 😲
Now imagine this with minecraft expansion mods
uhmmmmm how???????????????? thats it just how???
pc mfs when they find out their minecraft map is prebuilt
So um when is the next one coming out?
These are some of the buildings I want to expect would happen in the new hytale game
You should totally add some sort of large adobe structure into the mesa biome, I think that would be very interesting!
Can u make a world just like that but kind a medieval times
To the ones who disliked, Do you guys know how to appreciate   something?
i'm so impressed oh my god i don't mnow what else to say
imagine this but mod compatible , wonder what could come out of that
you should use the create mode just for the soul purpose of making the windmill spin
coolest map ever
You should try terraria
I am just like you at building but 10 billion times worse😎
suggestion: put a Rick Astley easter egg, rickroll = funny, funny idea = large mainstream
can you do a sulvival series of this world?
Amazing
Ship reck
this is so cool !! i cant wait to see more biomes (☆｡☆)
the name of the map
This is the coolest  Minecraft world
I want to play on the map 🥺🥺
make a huge crystal cave
Give dowland link pls
Their should be a bridge connecting mushroom biome and both sides of island
Where can I download this, or am I misunderstanding something.
You must work on mojang man!
gonna be the best map to spend time playing durring summer
i cant wait for this to be downloadable
This is actually amazing I will definitely be playing this when it’s released
How would you get saplings from the trees if they are custom-made?
"The Elder Scrolls", but it's in minecraft
THIS IS SO COOL!!
brooo i need this map
Is this a mod?
5
Can you make a snow mountain with ender portal secretly hidden inside of it ?
Maybe a road connecting all of the villages together would be cool 🤷‍♂️
Trixyblox : we only need 80k likes and the map is playable- Us : 384k likes go brrrrrr
I can’t be the only one who feels like a few of the things feel out of place right? I don’t know what it is though, which feels weird.
we need a massive cave to explore in the map somewhere
Will this be avalible for both bedrock and java or just one?
you need to join dream smp
if this was minecraft videos like this wouldnt exist
I hope the creator of mincraft hires u 👌
Ur a amazing builder man can't wait to play on the world when finished
Whit what app do you make a minecraft world like this
I was really hoping this was uploaded a few months ago so I could see more videos
doing God’s work❤️
"Just some minor details" **Proceeds to change every block from the construction**
where is the download??
im sry but isnt the pyramid from gravity falls thx
moreee wandering traders or clericsss thatssss amazing i miss the duke RE8
Wow
It , its , its beautiful
Imagine a team hunger games on this map with each team taking a biome.
I can't wait to play this!! Thank you so much wow this is amazing!!!
why did people dislike this, they are just jalous
Hey man! I love the project you're working on.  Since I noticed that you wanted to make an in-depth lore for the villagers, I'm willing to offer myself as a writer! My mother is an English teacher, and, after a few tests that she prepared for me, managed to determine that I have a C1 level of English proficiency.  If you are interested, shoot me a DM on my discord: krumpyy#7539.  I hope to hear from you soon :)
SMH.. you can’t just remake Skyrim AGAIN Bethesda...
This is so cool
If there's no herobrine-related building on this map ill delete my minecraft
In the mountains make the cave from starwars when the yeti takes luke Skywalker
The pillager area looks like a motte and Bailey castle
Duuuuude, you can totally make the 10 kingdoms!!! Desert (ancients), Mesa (money makers), Savanna (dark dealers) Taiga (cool dealers), Snowy mountains (winter people/creatures), Dark Wood forest (DRAGONS), jungle (tribes), mushroom (fortress of hidden jewels), underwater (based on the one you're building on another vid) and the main ruler would be Plains (huge kingdom you already build). And last, but not least, all of it would be a sum and each contributed by the advanced buildings you already build!!!
You should add a big tree that would be called ,,Tree of Life" somewhere in the oak village
I had no comment for that only wt can i say i will sup
Me on console ;-;
If you can try to make it bedrock friendly
This is incredible. I would absolutely love to play this map when it’s completed. I have a small question: Are you planning on also customizing the Nether and/or end dimensions of the map? Seeing as you said you’d like to make it feel almost adventure map-esque in a way, I’d like to know if and what you plan on doing with the dimensions other than the overworld.
This is serious dedication first he plains how the map is gonna look, then he decides what he is gonna make, THEN HE BUILDS ALL OF IT AND FINALLY HE EDITS THE ENTIRE VIDEO. Wow that’s dedication if I’ve ever seen it
The map, and detailing itself, is outstanding. The shaders makes it even more thrilling, great effort!
pls send the world download
Build a formula 1 circuit!!!!
cAN YOU ADD A STAR WARS SECSHTION
Great video. Thanks for the entertainment
Nice but there is a coral reef you know but nice vid just saying about it
Here’s rivers
When finished, i play
Part 2!!! Part 2!!!
This is the first time I came to your channel, and OH MY GOD you are such a mad lad and what beautiful map . Ya gained yourself a subscriber Edit: oh I so so so wanna live in the pillager outpost you made on the plain biome. sadly it had plenty of residents
WHOA! this is so cool!! it would be cool if we get some references to herobrine in this
This is Incredible.
Drop the seed plz
Me sitting here hoping I can download this for bedrock edition
I’m on bedrock will I still be able to play
Build a pirate hideaway
Make Guillotine in one of the cruel biomes like so he can see
If you’re still taking suggestions, a mountain fortress or castle split in half by a volcanic ravine could be an excellent addition to one of the areas as well as a great place for story elements.
whens the download going to be out
His ugly face destroy the hole Video
Make a little Temple like structure at the place u spawn (Botw style)
its reminds me of wano country in onepiece
u shold mek a cave thing
Bro this sounds too fun I’m defo gonna play this when you finish
Three words dwarf ice mines
Can you also do bedrock edition too if not it’s fine
I can't see an upgrade of me :(
Dude I can't wait to explore this world when it's done keep up the good work yo
MatPat NEEDS to get on this
Am I the  only one that saw the map and went "haha amogus"
After you finish the biomes you should do the nether and the end
It would be cool if somewherein the water there was an Atlantis ruin
You're a whole diffrent specie,salute to the dedication!
The intro lookin kinda sus 👀👀👀
Big yes
The dream smp story would fit that world
Is available to download
11:45 both those horses must be named  Giga Juan and Giga Juanita
Can you add cats in the dessert, since ancient egyptians liked them!
Trixy: We need 80k likes! 300k+ people : yeah...we kinda went a little over...
I wonder is Mojang watches this.
imagine he clicked on his mouse more than 16,000,000 times!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Do the bounding boxes work for the structures? Like will pillagers actually spawn?
That's fucking great, i'll keep that in mind for the day it will be available
Will this be available on bedrock? If it’s ever released?
any map link
10:16 cool
so umm 400k likes um where the world download sir trixy blox
Know this is hard work 👍
Can you send me this map? Plis on my gmail mtnt.mat@gmail.com
You should put pillager output tents on in random areas with random loot
I feel like minecraft would be 110% better game if they added  1 - physics ( So you can create rotating windmills and working big boats )  2 - RPG elements because the games combat isn't that complex and mostly boring
Where can we download the map?
Omg it's so amazing you almost cry (don't take it literally)😁😁😁
Dude u should remake the dream smp like u did with pewds mc world
Wheres part two
How do i download this map?
Is there a way we could get the download of just the blank world without structures for now too? I’m dying to see that mesa canyon with my own eyes
I have a suggestion! You could build a lonely house right outside a giant cave, where the resident of the house would tell you that he is the sole survivor if a massacre that took place in the cave. The cave has only zombies with enchanted armors but if you reach the end, great treasures await you, including diamonds and enchanting books!
i went to his channel hoping to watch another video about this and then became very sad
My house would look funny near villages like these ;-;
Can I we get the map ?
There must be an Endor Star Wars Easter Egg in the Dark Forest Biome!
Put iron or coal in some of the bigger Boulders
Add like, a hole going into the nether
Change the nether and end if you can
I think having a massive active nether portal within the mooshroom island could be fun, where you mix the fungal traits of the nether and the biome for lore
You: 80,000 likes for part 2 Me: waches how many likes do this video have  Like button: 381k Me: what the f*ck
This would be great for tek topia
This man is AMAZING at building
anyone else here from r/minecraft
Am I the only one that saw the farm shaped like the heart and lungs? I suppose it symbolizes how friendly the villagers are to nature 9:58
I hope this gets on console, I'd buy this
liked and subscribed, verry pleased
Gimme, that juicy JUICY map
Also, make an end and nether so the world will be playable ill be so happy
I wanna play it
wow
Man mojang should Recruit you your skills are to great I've never be so excited like that
Croissant
Wish this was downloadable on console 😭
Please make a big stronghold castle somewhere in the icy mountains
You're doing Mojang's job
I WANT TO PLAY ON THIS
Can you make one for bedrock edition pls 🙏 😢😢😢
This should be a battle royale map
Would this be playable on bedrock or only java?
When are you transforming it all?
Now all you need is Ds combat and voice acting and you have the best game ever.
This needs mods, specifically made for it.
How much times did you press: e
The vanilla church reminds me of either a duck or the old lady in the shoe
Dam your dope
THIS IS EPIC!
This is a reaaaaally ambitious and cool project, i think the like/dislike ratio proves how much cool were the things u showed
Lol 80,000 likes. 300,000+ later ...
this got me soooo excited
I look forward to playing this map! It looks awesome :)
you should add a battlefield in the snow part in the map and add pilligers
I know you want a new version of Minecr-
I think that you should have collectible custom items throughout the entire build
DOWNLOAD NOW!!!! .......PLSS
Ideas: - a destroyed and abandoned village that got attacked by a mysterious monster in the northern snowy mountains - a giant underground beehive in the savanna  - different kinds of booby traps in the Jungle biome (made by the native villagers)  - a waterfall in the center of the Jungle - an oasis in the desert  - a lich king castle in the snowy mountains with spawners and loot - a big horror underground zombie dungeon near the infested village as the heart of the zombie swarm - a witch hut near the lake in the plains biome - a long deep chasm splitting the savanna from the taiga with many ressources on the bottom and a lot of lava (kind of like the World Scar in ARK)  - a big mineshaft in the savanna with a whole underground village (maybe a direct connection to the underground beehive and the chasm) - a giant dinosaur fossil in the desert (maybe another abandoned village underneath the fossil with many hidden skeleton spawners, kind of like a skeleton dungeon) - a glacier looking towards the ocean in the north of the snowy mountains  - a magical area in the southwest of the dark wood forest with many different colourful flower types on the ground and an entrance to an overgrown cave that leads to the Jungle  - a destroyed overgrown harbour with a lighthouse in the water (which shows the location of the ocean monument)  - a bamboo forest in the jungle with a small japanese inspired building in the middle (maybe an enchanted sword or a bow in that building)  - a giant stronghold in the northwest ocean. It should look like a castle in the middle of the ocean and have at least one very high tower (so the player can use that area to jump off with an elytra)  - a “death island“ in the northeast ocean as an arena for the wither. It should look like a dead scorched plains biome with multiple dead trees and a few wither skeletons lurking around. This area could be the boss arena of the wither - a giant luminous exotic dark overgrown cave biome right beneath the dark wood forest - the mysterious snow monster (as mentioned earlier) could live in a cave (that the player will find by reading several diaries from the abandoned village and following the clues) which could lead directly to the giant luminous cave. However, there could be even more entrances. The “magic flower cave“ could also lead to this biome. It would be very astonishing to find such a lively, exotic and colourful biome completely underground with very few entrances. This would also connect the story of the darkwood forest with the jungle as well as the snowy mountains. The diaries could tell stories from an underground world full with unknown dangers and flora. The player would be teased and hyped up by these diaries and would eventually find this biome beneath the zombie infected dark wood forest. It would add many layers imo. (Look up ARK Aberration if you want to see what I was thinking of) I also noticed that you don‘t have any birch trees on the island. Birch wood (and emeralds maybe) could be found in that cave biome
Apparently big structures to us are small structures to trixy.. Man i really want to be as talented as him 😞
HOLY MOTHER OF LORD THAT BIRDS EYE VIEW IS BIGGGGGGGG BWOIIIIIIII
He has a glass eye?
I think it will be good if you will make dark wood forest dungeon. The idea is very interesting at real

is he going to make a woodland mansion?

You should use mods, it would make it easier to make and it will look better, it still looks amazing if don't. Good job
I think the plains village should have some walls around it of some sort, seems too open
Add lore
I have allways wanted to play on world like that !! .... vanila generation of minecraft world is .. little bit boring ... and be able to play clasic survival  on world like that is just amazing idea... I hope you will make it to the end and wish you the best of luck ... also Im very big fan of vikings and norse mythologi ... it would be great to see some sort of viking village in your Snow biom
The small village house is better than anything I could ever build
Me, who still don't understand why this isn't in the original game.
Just WOW 🤩 that looks ssssooooo good and detailed, when can we download the world? I would love to play it
I WOULD DOWNLOAD THIS IT LOOKS SO COOL
I will be playing this immediately
I’ve always imagined a world with all my friends were we all own a biome and sorta have our own countries and in the middle is a safe zone, a zone where people can trade for goods to get things that they can’t get in their country.
In the desert maybe build some sort of prison
Maybe you could do some gipsey stuff like that in peaky blinders i dont now whats that cald those cars i would be cool in that westerns biome
A Skyrim like underground dwarven city
The nether and end could definitely use some work too... ;)
What about custom mine shaft under the builde
This guys a magician.

this is literally amazing ur so good
I want the caves and cliffs update to look like them snow mountains

This is so cool, how can i get announced when will this be realesed ?
in the jungle build a dinosaur tribe
where is the download link?
You should also try and make the nether world part of the main story you are making to have the story more open world style to it
1.3k dislikes, WTH! Why would someone dislike this? Just why?
This is gonna be soooo goood to plaay in
I wish Vanilla mc actually looked like this🥺🥺
This is looks like an epic representation of hunger games map from the movie, it's a huge dome and has lots of biomes(I think)
Whoa that's big, thats atleast like, 2 football fields wide
1.23 million subs, weird.
Wow........... best world for survival  can i play in this world
H - How How do you build like that? I mean how those thematic designs even pop in your head?
The elder minecraft: Skyblock
i would love you to add some dangerous mobs
This reminds me of wano from one piece and the mooshroom island is onigashima from the map
It would be great if there was a base in the center of the map
Wow........... best world for survival  can i play in this world
Dude, give to the player a objective to explore the map, like, which biome has a secret gem, and the player need to get all of them to open a super secret dungeon idk, but I would love to play like this, like, you would need to look for clues in books, signs etc.
i need this world!
I honestly would love to play this when its done, my issue is, its probably gonna be for PC- and my pc is dead so now I only have bedrock edition on my phone
Mojang:hire this men
this would be so fun to play hunger games with ur friends
Am a beginner at Minecraft where can i play this?
Did anyone else see peter rabbit on the thumbnail?

So are you working on your vid or?
You should have a huge river separating the jungle in 2 and even putting a still-intact-boat in the river

Someone needs to make a mod pack for this

Tip For This: Remember Disc 11: Make the scene where that happen and make a diary or journal that says his diary or journal
A secret watermelon house in jungle
Mojang should hire you you're amazing

I love how he adjusted the flag at 6:28 to go against the wind direction (Based on the clouds)
We need someone to download this, and film a FULL GAMEPLAY of this. Dream should do a speedrun in this too!!
Thank you bro...I always wanted to play in a map like this
Big sky island
You should be hired by Mojang for ideas and development.
Can you download on bedrock
It's like the Naruto map but the other villages are not there hahaha
Me: This church is huge TrixyBlox: This church is small compared to my other work. Also me: Whaaaat? Nice job keep going i need that world
I see kids burning villages and this guys is just doing them the largest favor

Petition to make dream play this map.
💎
This is amazing stuff man. keep it up.
AMOGUS MINECRAFT MAP!!!
this is bringing back memories of breath of the wild
UFO??
This remind me of Bionicle, with its islands being splitted into six specifics regions, Mata Nui being the best example
Download link?
I think it would be cool if someone could add some minor redstone things to the map, like make the traveling villager actually travel
(If you wouldn't mind, like this comment so it gets higher on the comment section :P)  You should add a statue of Lenin (the Russian leader preceding stalin) pointing since in Antarctica there is a statue of exactly that!  Maybe even a crashed plane (resembling the Li-2 if possible?) near it with a diary to referencing the expedition!  It's called the Pole of Inaccessibility and its in the farthest point from the ocean in Antarctica I completely understand if that's too big for a simple easter egg but nonetheless I'm really interested to see where this goes!
Can this be playable on the Xbox?
what about the caves??
@TrixyBlox can I use this for a private smp?
When will we be able to download this
I have some restaurants and structures
Imagine doing this all in survival
Image building the whole thing lol
Wow
hello where can i find the map u made
Who
Red dead redemption  2 in minecraft
i think this guy just made minecraft 2
what if your make an underground secret structure, like a hidden huge pyramid, and just the tip of the pyramid can be seen from above, but don’t tell us where it is so we have to find it
Question what about the swamps?
Make a flag for the top of the tallest mountains, to make them seem like someone explored that mountain
Build a secret lab
This looks amazing cant wait to play hopefully it will have generated ores
There should be a hidden cave in the snow biome that had a secret bunker in it
When can you download it?
Secret bases
I wonder if my potat laptop can handle this world
A "nether maze undwrworld" deep below the surface would be cool, but then again, i guess you could just build a portal to plain old regular nether.
Iovy
😆
😆
😆
Can u plzz add the link of the world in the description.
If this is for 1 mil i wonder whats for 10 mil🤔🤔  Anyway good luck on building the rest of it. Its obviously amazing af. And dont forget to take breaks and have fun
Make a beetroot farm
Totally not me getting Danganronpa vibes from the title 😗
I love this 😭❤️
Wow , could you add a download with just the vanilla stuff in ?
If you make this playable for others, does that include console??
i just have one single question, are there ores/caves so u can really play it in survival?
Hire this guy
God hard work
A few minutes into the video and this has to be the most interesting video I’ve watched can’t wait for this to be finished ❤️
Bruh you should be hired by Minecraft and make these the new things
If you make this map free to play i'll actually be willing to donate you some of my monthly savings, this is simply amazing <3
Your ability to build towers is beyond comprehension
please put the Tribal on the build
In the Mesa biom make the Pillar men from Jojo pls
How about a upgraded end and neither
Part 2 part 2 part 2
Seed plss! Nice video!! 🔥❤
Add ores: And strong hall
There should be a ton of cool you tubers using this map and each one gets assigned a biome and is required to build and make everything in there. I think it would be interesting to see how everybody reacts to having limited resources to trade or fight for.
Eat your cereal please
This doesn't even look like minecraft, looks more like something from modpacks. Awesome work!
I subbed :)
Can’t wait to play this keep up the amazing work
*mojang wants to know your position*
**Minecraft In 2050** Anyone Else Hyped For 1.17 Full Release + Biomes O'Plenty With TerraForge!!!
This looks SICK i only have one question... do ores + caves spawn?
someone need to make a video about surviving 100 days here but maybe with some mods of choice
is this on bedrock to?
Will this map be available for Xbox download?
This is.....oh god this is..... i cant say it with words.....its amazing you changed minecraft....completly damn your a good builder
whoever is working at majong is slacking bruh 🙄 hahahaha
One huge dragon standing  looking down  at the map
You should do the nether and the end and a strong hold
Is there a world download?
evolve the history like make modern day buildings and airports and cities and stuff
Add some abandoned shack on the snow biome and put some poster of yeti on it
For the desert village there should be a Muslim church because the Muslim world is in places like the Middle East and northern Africa which are deserts
Can you please sometimes make a tutorial about how to use worldedit because I don‘t even know how to put it on a map and I‘m sure I‘m not the only one who wants to build large things but just hasn‘t got the nerve to place every block by itself.🙏🏼
more, more, more!!
You should collab with jeracraft
You win
He should work for Mojang..seriously
Remember to ADD Ores!
Exited me speechless
I’m not going to change the plains village much  Also him: gives the farmer a house x4 times the height
I came here from reddit
hi this is the coolest thing i've ever seen i'm subbing ok bye
you gotta make a mushroom village bro
MORE MORE MORE
I suck at building in any game. After watching this I'm just a little motivated. I know I'll never make something like this, but I'll just upgrade my block of a house in Minecraft. Unrelated to the video, but I said it anyway.
Can you recreate mumbo jumbos giant temple from hermit craft season 7
Ouhhhhh Man! Wow...
mans looking like fake jake and logan paul had a child.
I am surprised there was not a blacksmith as I would have loved to see you transform one but maybe in a different village in a different biome
I guess I'm new to the whole Minecraft game but where do you find a program like this
If you can PLEASE make this compatible with the mod tektopia
WOW! Dude, this right here is a MASTERPIECE!
A secret underground dwarves mine and village! Or a pirates cavern full of riches
The dedication-
Can’t wait for the final project
PLEASE make the taiga and snowy mountains border viking themed..... It would look cool and fit in really well
Your island looks like PAC Man 🤣
Pc really said: I’m built Different 💪
Climate change be like
Man I miss building Minecraft, but my PC can't run it anymore  because of some open GL error.
i don't know why i got saw you in my recommendation now but very nice work +1sub  and like from me
Yo this is sick
We need this to be a real game
The idea of having different places of worship for different biomes is amazing!
Would this be possible to play on bedrock? I have a few Xbox friends who would love to play such a awesome survival map with me
Island do be looking kinda sus
100% going to play the world it looks super cool
Okay. How could you build something in this world without feeling shame
Make a floating island that has a ice spike mansion
So glad to see Botw as an inspiration source ! The landscapes in that game are truly beautiful
Somethings wrong with my world My crops won't grow Tree leaves are not disappearing When i go inside a cave there was alot of zombies skeletons creepers in there and causing me to lag  See cows in a mushroom biome using /locatebiome when i do  "/locatebiomeruined_portal" It teleports me to a random plain Zombies sometimes dosen't attack me only if i push them  rotten flesh in my animal farm not despawning Sheeps that i sheared are not growing back there wool Dirt not growing back grass on top of them (even if there's grass near) My farmland not turning to wet soil instead stays in dries soil and turning into dirt again Saplings not growing New generated mountains sometimes is made out of 90% gravel Game lags when i try to dig down Not finding any type of biomes in the nether just netherack wastelands Barely finding iron, coal When i place block on me it disappears and i have to rejoin this always happens its guaranteed Campfires not showing smoke Barrier blocks not going away when im not holding barrier blocks  Chests not making animations Pigs in caves  When i break iron sometimes dosen't  drop and rejoining to happen i never broke the iron I keep crashing World gets corrupted i don't see anything wrong with my system  I have alot of space left I have good pc runs minecraft at 100 fps and everytime i fullscreen it crashes
I cant even build a proper house Pls build me one
Ok, for an idea, I suggest having a hidden cult dedicated to Herobrine, with those Herobrine monuments that used to be popular
Reminds me of an ARK world
I want to play this world when you finish it
Is this available on xbox?
You know what you need a reward cause there is nobody I know that is going to do all dat
How do You paste the vanilla structures actually? And are all those mods available on just single player?  Also in world painter You used some custom brushes, right? Would you perhaps share them? (And one question about world Generator - can You make custom ore distribution in the world painter?)  And for the map itself... well not all biomes transition look natural to me. I think I would rather go with Desert->Messa->Savannah->Jungle-> Dark Wood forest-> Taiga-Snowy Mountain Or perhaps even switch desert with messa.  As for how it look like... well while I'm actually a fan of more basic, simplistic default style of Minecraft - in my scale this transformed structures, trees etc look really custom, they already are quite far from default Minecraft feel - I must admit it looks great. And even though I'm rather fan of having one world played all the time and infinitely expanding it... I think I will download it when it's finished.  and it inspired me to go back to my old idea of my custom Minecraft world(for which actually the story came first)... but for the central hub I kinda intend to use well sort of custom biome.
You made Red Dead Redemption 2 in Minecraft
Pls make this available in bedrock and I feel like there should be a massive jungle temple in the jungle biom because I dont think I have acctually come across one in survival
Yo its Very AMAZING
Man do I want to play this map
great now make the balkans
Yo what happend to your right eye brow???
Yo, bro, you really should make a tropical coast like Hawaii or so
Pls make part 2! Im so exited!
Why don't you work with some devs and make a giant RPG map?
Does this remind anyone else of Mata Nui?
put yourself inside the map somewhere desining the map if you know what i mean
I'm interested in seeing more, since this is incredible!!! The stupidest idea i can come up with is shadow cowboys for the western biome they are atleast 6,7 tall (or atleast bigger than you) ofcourse have guns (range weapons) and sometimes have horses. You probably can't make it and i understand since it's a mob rather then a building of some sort, toldya it was a stupid idea.
Put a boss in every biomes :)
You've got 3 times like the likes, where's the dl?
How in the world… Your so good at building…
Where is the download
This may be too much to ask, but consider changing the other dimensions as well! A themed nether and end dimension would be sick!
Can you plz put this free on console
This is art
how about an eye in ice like on snowy mountin biome
0:01 AMOGUS!!!!!!!!!!
Kinda sus
Can’t wait to play this!
Reminds me of a game called The Forest, but man, this is Amazing
I was wondering what world i should use for my discord survival realm. Maybe i can use this?
Can We download This Map?
This is the best thing ever created in minecraft
p o g
You should just make this world a multiplayer survival realam
You should put this on the Minecraft Bedrock store and make it free as well... I'm not even kidding!
epic but make a barn
rdr2 in minecraft
This indeed deserves likes😩
Maybe if you add some kind viking village in thundra biome, or massive building on top of the biggest mountain
How long did this take you?? That is a brilliant achievement
Can I download this map?
Mojang hire this man
Ice den for a werewolf
Were can I download its reach 80k likes
Imagine griefing this world? 🤔
I'm litterally ready to pay for playing this Map!!
wow
Is this gonna cost us mine coins and will where this be found at
AMAZING
Include a kingdom besides villages, so maybe a kingdom with a village connected to it
This is literally amazing I really would like to play through this build!!! I would love it if when I download the world I would find things or secrets that were not shown in the video in terms of lore I guess.
Will that be fully fonctional o-o? (end, water temple boss etc)
WOW you are just crazy. I would love to play this map. Hopefully you will succeed because it is a great idea that you just can't see.
When you put your shaders on
this is extremely cool
U could eat a full course meal watching this video
I'm so excited to play this with my friends
You really must be an minecraft worker.I think if you add those biomes into the game,that would make minecraft a better game
Plane crashes
Name of the world is Minecraft Breathe of the Wild. This also looks amazing btw
The world he made is just everyone dream seed
I have an idea for the mushroom biome, perhaps have a huge central mushroom over looking everything and perhaps it’s hollow and the inside has mini mushrooms so you can go all the way up but then it could also lead inside, underground  If you get what I mean, I’m kind of on about that darksouls tree that leads to ash lake
Sheeesh
What r u going to do for the nether and the end
i really hope when all this is done the download map link is free access because if it isnt itd be a massive shame
Skyrim vibes
Finna play this once it’s finished
A huge dragon in an underground cave with treasures
Are yOu GoNnA fInIsh ThAt kWaSol           (Its croissant but i heard something else)
dudee This is INSANEE
this is just so good
You should create Earth.
I can't imagine how long this take
This world looks absolutely incredible, can't wait to see what you do with the rest of the biomes!!!  Also super hyped for the world to become downloadable.
if minecraft was actually like this, it would be so fun omg
This is an epic idea love everything but here's an idea for the village . Make an inn it would be lit and would give more reality and story to the tarde and visitors to the village to stay somewhere bring in also the concept of the wandering trader a little more alive
what shaders is this
You are amazing bro
Bro... 😯
when minecraft hired you: me: lets play minecraft all day long :)
make a kingdom with lots of good loot
Land of wano
I suggest in the snowy biome to have something like underground frozen cave. Like it has a forgotten civilization.
Idea:Dark forest shuld have some special mobs with special loot added its the most dangerus one and the danger level gpes clockwise with biomes and to not die instantly by going into the biomes you must compleate a boss that pushes ypu further into it(something like valhiem)
The island like bionicle
The thumbnail looks like... AMON-
I have a few friends that love survival games and I have subbed just so I can see how this turns out can’t wait to play
This is soooooooo coool man excited to play with all my friends and discover the map
where do i go to download this world?
So far
I like this dude
How did you done the map? is this an software?
I've already made a suggestion but I have another. When building in a dessert I tend to stick to one of 2 themes. And often do both. Egyptian  architecture and large settlements for army's of skeletons. I'd build the skeletal remains of a large beast and build a scrappily constructed city in which the dead would reside. In fact you could make multiple evil settlements in each of the biomes each one holding key required items to finish the story
i dont think i could even make those tents in the pillager outpost.
You should totally do a survival/hardcore letsplay!
After you finish this project. Try contacting popular Minecraft content YouTubers to play survival in this magnificent world.
Why is your logo looks like translucentTB's logo🧐🧐
can I download this map? plsssssss
Wow🥰🥰i wish i could build like that🥺🥺🥺🥺
For the wild west part you should base it of off red dead redemption 2
Microsoft ought to be hiring you to build the POI's in Minecraft...would make exploring so much more interesting to find a decent set of buildings instead of the usual boring ones...
80k likes you say?? 😎😏
Noice
Finally I can play 3D Catan!
Can you some how make it like the gta rp where people can play together
Welp I,mma Just Gonna Watch People Play This Map Because I Dont Have Any Pc For This Map But Welp I Wish I Can Tho
Wife: he's probably looking girls on the internet  Him: upgrading Minecraft 7 days straight
Tricyblox can you please tell me what texture pack you use I've been trying get this forever
If you plan to also build a way to the end I'd suggest making a large tower  that breaks high into the sky. Put it somewhere to the left of the howl world though making it incredibly difficult to get to. Design it similarly to that of the end city and make it incredibly well fortified. It could not only reach high into the sky and do make the only entrance at the very top. Not only will it be high but it could be very deep into the ground at the bottom lays the portal. In the end well. I'll leave that part alone.
Add a underground futuristic civilization.
Okay thats cool and all but build the whole breath of the wild map
i have a question. Will this map be free?
Will this become a series?
d
I got 6 ads in 10 minutes... Come on man.
MORE MORE MORE MORE
It should be an escape map. I think you should add a map to show the locations of every chest in every biome so the player has to go through all the biomes. After they get to all the chests,  they can activate the portal at the big island to finish the game.
can i download the map somewhere to play on it with my friends?
The island is sus
Well, you hit the like goal, so where can i find the world download?
Dungeon, mineshaft, and ravine?
very exciting
OMG I WANT THIS MAP, SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!
i totaly want to play on this map
Add bridges across the mountains in the mesa biome
What program did you use to make the world?
Yay since this is a big project I don't have to worry that this will come before my exams finish . ( there's 1 and a half weeks left )
Me who gives up on building a box house:
Maybe you could add a cave with a dragon with loot chest that has really powerful loot  Ps. Would this be for free on bedrock because if it is I would love to play this with my friends. I would give full crowds to you tho.
In the village you forgot the blacksmith house, also absolutely stunning work with the fisherman house
Are you going to continue with the under water castle world? Just wondering, obviously do what you think is best.
Are you going to have mega bosses like Mutant whither or something. Like an upgraded Whither? or an upgraded ender dragon. Mayby a new forever dragon.
is there any way i can download this map?
Keep going bro this is really adorable
Question, does making the world in world painter spawn in ore under ground, or is it all just stone? Would kinda suck if you couldn't mine..
Would be cool if the Nether was upgraded too if you decide to repair the Nether portal
This is the best map I've ever seen
This looks amazing wow
This guy is the bob ross of Minecraft
Just subbing so I know when this releases...
“Ey get it to 80k likes for world download” Does 360k work?
Are you an architect by profession?
Very cool project!
In the Ice mountain biome you should make an underground kingdom
That's so creative
Your a legend 😯  Can we play this map if you finish it
11:18 i thought he was going to say back of the mansion
Java or bedrock, i play bedrock edition because java is just too laggy for me, if its not, can you make a copy for bedrock
Ask's for 80 000 likes. All the viewers let's multiply that with 4.5. Yeah
Where's the link?
Wow
i can't wait for this to be done, me and my friends gonna have an epic adventure
Satisfied by this videos
I don’t know if this makes sense, but I think the savana biome should be like going on a safari or something like that, both very open with tall grasses, and some small dense forests dotted here and there like a real African savana.
pls I want to play it soo bad. finish this fast!!!
The big boulder in the plains biome reminded me of the hobbit, when they were cornered. Then it led to a cave that went to the elf kingdom.
How good would it be in the center of the map exist the supermassive tree
A          M        O        G          U          S
Saw you on reddit
You forgot iron golems for the village
Pls Mojang hire this man
I have an idea, it's for plot, so there will be multiple endings and the True one is when you fix the ruined portal and go in, you will go to either a nether Fortress or a complete bastion ( all of them modified of course), and you have to go to the end of both of them to go to the stronghold and beat the end to and see what is the True ending. Hope you do it cause it will be interesting to see how much endings are there and what we will see. And maybe have a reward, or even get command blocks so that it becomes RPG-like
Download link??? 👀👀👀
I desperately need to play this oml
u getting the plains village and outpost from skyrim?
Make in taiga a little hut of diary of about how this guy was going to steal a bunch of gold from the bank you should add in the wild west town
Nether and end remodel
if mojang does make this a thing im uninstalling minecraft
How many times did minecraft crashed?
maybe you should add a plane crash at the desert with some loot i guess??
You should add the normally spawned chests
Mojang hire this guy right now to re texture all your structures and biomes NOOOW
I’m Dab— Ayo lets GooO
I don't know why the people who just Play games get more Views than people who Make and Develop the Games????     It's same with the MONEY as with VIEWS!!!!!!!
This could be an rpg minecraft world for your friends
is it just me or is the thumbnail a little sus
you should make some sort of boss fight lol
Holy shit, this is insane! I really look forward to playing this my friends!
We need a huge volcano at the center of the map
I hope you finish it someday and I also hope the seed works in PE, I would love to play it!
🤫
this is an best world for survival
I want you to add many modes
This is AWESOME
I Love it Please give us the seed link
Is this available in bedrock edition tho?
New Jerracraft kingdoms of Greymane. Y E S.
Me who wants to play this: *cries in bedrock*
This guy needs so much more credit
you should make the nether biome too !!! ;D
Would really love to see this map get worked into something lore rich filled with secrets and treasures
MADE THIS A MOD PLS I NEED IT LOOKS SOO GOOD PLEASE SPAM @TrixyBlox
What seed that 😐😂
I saw this on reddit a few days ago!
And can you make a bedrock edition version
You should of made a volcano that would be cool but it’s still cool
Can you make a download of this ?
Petition to make this an hour long
I want to play in this world so badly!
Idea: you should put a crashed ufo at the bottom of the ocean
Would love to see a secret cave inside the mountain with giant crystals coming out of the walls!
me:smirking at my potato pc my potato pc: don’t you think about it
How can you dislike the video ?
I will 100% play at if I can
Cool 👀❤
I look good
This is the most disgusting thing I have ever watched. Like, I think this may count as visual ASMR. I can’t look at vanilla Minecraft anymore without thinking, “This could look better.”
Where can I buy
I have a few ideas to add to the map: -A Giant Skeleton Ender dragon -Floating Islands with Structures in it. -Massive Underground Orc caves -A Giant Tree Colony (Kinda like the one from Avatar) -A Ugraded version of a dessert temple -Ice Spike mountains on the Artic region -Maybe add a few hidden messages and clues to solve said mysteries?  I think the Main End Portal would look good inside a cave in my opinion.
wow i cant even build a house
Minecraft: Breath of the Wild
I love how this biome is based off of BOTW. It’s an absolutely beautiful game and this looks like it will be too
I don't care what the haters say anymore, this game and the community are both amazing and beautiful.
Hey TrixyBlox mind if my friend uses this map for his server map? He will give full credit.
When you want to preview the builds but ur broke so u can't pay for patreon
Make a criminal underworld.  Place where human trafficking,black market,witchcraft service been going long time.build it inside a ravine so it get evil-ish vibe
Where's the swamp

E
I've never been more convinced to subscribe to a channel. Take your time man, it'll be epic I know
I'm convinced this is just Westworld in Minecraft.
Amazing, just amazing.
9:45 yeaaah don't forget the potatoes 😂😂😂
This is cool if this were on the original minecraft i would play it ALL DAY
Its so beautiful
Minecraft but it's open world RPG ? I'm interested
What happened to his eyelashes???
I don't think the map should be modded by default for accessibility but it would be amazing if there was a modded varyant of this
“I did a little building off camera”
make a custom biome that is so large and it should be a forest with no light ,add siren head in this map
Dang appreciated this fam effort, keep up the good work
Omg this is so f COOL HOW DO U DO THIS?!?!
Good job 👍🏽
I am so jealous
Yooo, this is sick!
Yo u need to be on the design team for minecraft. This would be awesome to play on as a seed

Smart people will not destroy these they would use these
You could do a Woodland Mansion.
Will the map have a download

Can you do a huge,but very hidden Jungle temple with a lot of traps and a big treasure room?
Amazing
This is actually really really cool!! I love it!!
I have an idea: maybe a new island with a volcano on it and a secret through the lava
You should rebuild buildings in the dream smp
Hey i have an idea could you make the Snow biome Asassins Creed Vallhala(viking) related?
Forge labs pls if the build is done..  Play this
Can you download this in mobile
Small ewok tree village in the jungle 😳😳😳
Man, that's the first video youtube recommended to me. You are awesome! I loved your project and will definitly play on it when it's ready. I'm just afraid of it beeing too big to play with friends on a server
When the villagers are living better than me:

The legend of Minecraft-Smell of the blocks
This is exactly why java is better than bedrock

Rich villages, extreme pillager outposts and a broken misplaced nether protal

Yo listen Minecrafts hight limit is going higher and bedrock deeper
woodland mansion?
island looks kinda sus when being created
Waiting when you will finish, to dowloand it
Buildings good and all, but mate you are just begging too much for clout. Like i get it, but people will subscribe and support you if they enjoy your content, you dont have to be so greedy and beg this much. Its even discouraging people to subscribe.

I appreciate your hard and I want to play it soon.
can you make a pixelmon one or a pixelmon region
I dont play minecraft .. but that is amazing so much hard work
where is the download?
Man, You should enter the mojang op team 👏👏big claps for u
Amazing
I got some idea for you to uses for this awesome map! So if you know bionicle g1, if don't. They are villages for each element, fire, ice, water, earth, wind and stone. So how about this, tries to make a hidden underground cites while also make a temple that hidden a sighs of the end. As well as add in some mods creature for the maps as well. That's my idea. Also make each villages has a element with them.
Is it weird that I wanna live there?
dammm this looks the same as the map of wano kuni
That should be an hunger games arena
Speechless
Ok damn this plains design is already too good im getting hyped for the other biomes.
Oh and by the way the clouds look awesome in the timelaps!
Can you add like a mosque in the savannah biome
You should make this into a smp and let popular streamers join it
If this had a download link im going to make a battlefield in this map between villagers and pillagers
And after this all a army of creeper will come and booom
Add a ruined colosseum structure which will have zombies with armour(to resemble as dead gladiators)
I want like you
What app u used to create the map?
Why dont you create a Kingdom and empire?
Did you post this on reddit too? Cuz someone posted it claiming its theirs
This is cool as shit and I’m subscribing
When you finish will you give us the world download?
Mojang : hmm , interesting !!
i will give you this map at 80k likes' Me seeing 358k likes. Were is the map
Do nether biomes next! 😳
Is this on bedrock or java of java then i will be sad :((((((((((((((((((((((((
why does this feel like genshin impact
If someone did this map with RLCraft installed I will absolutely love it
being that me and my friends love survival roleplay this map will be the best for roleplaying
Your so underrated
Now do it on console 😂
It would maybe be cool if there were some survivor npcs around the map I would love that.
AWESOME! 🤯🤯🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🥺🥺👍👍👍
How about making a giant hole and in the center is a end portal
Where map we already got 360k likes
Just imagine he built military theme world, like Pearls Harbour, Midway Old Harbour, ETC.
It would be really cool if you did like some mushroom huts like the Smurfs  PS. You should upgrade the swamps too
Im going to speedrun this world.
This is essentially what we are doing on our world and we've been doing it for over a year. We sadly, don't have access to world paint. So we've had to do everything by hand and with commands.😭😭
Please please make this available in the minecraft shop.
If this had a magic mod thingy, it would be amazing. Like Fairy Tail
Jakie to jest piękne!
I NEED THIS
Make a castle in the map!
You should make a huge grand river that runs through the whole map.
Bro your sick /cool
Trixy: Building massive pyramids and houses and ruins. Me who can’t even build a simple house: 😐
Yoooo man you have to build a vanilla structures!!!! I love this map, where can I download it?
Eyo I would love for you to add a underworld or Mount Everest!
Duuuude! I wanna play that map when it's finished! 😍 Where can I download it?
dang man u really had alot of time to do other things but did this.. respect dude
Could ps4 players get this map
Zelda botw in but minecraft
So the end and nether also will be upgraded?
I like the windmill, I just think the blades should be in an X shape instead of a +. The + shape kinda blocks alot of the building and it makes it hard to see the windmill itself. And the X shape would make it a bit more detailed. Other than that I love your buildings:]
This is litteraly terraria but in 3D
I suggest that you make it so that you can do something that triggers a staircase to some sky islands that have cool loot and beautiful looks
I think you beat 80k likes...
I subbed u becuz u deserve it😊(note to viewers: TrixyBlox spends days and weeks and months and maybe a entire year just for our enjoyment, so please, I am not forcing anyone but if you can, then please sub to his channel for his hard works)
This is like minecraft but we can use bonemeal on everything
Plssss download link
can i get the map download link for this world pleaseeeee😭😭😭🙏🙏
Cant wiat to play this
One of structures can be some kind of Demon king castle(or wither).
I think you can add a REALY BİG undergrounnd temple
Amazing
Hahahaha you noob you wanted only 80000 likes ? You understand that if community wants something you can get 6 times that easily you messed up
Dude youre insane i love it
wow
Mans literally did mojangs job for them for free
Add in a burned out airport or military convoy between the snowy mountains and the dark wood forest, preferably based off Russia, for some lor
Is your map is also available in mcpe
DAYUUUUM i cant wait for this map to drop and play it in survival and enjoing the game again, i didnt played minecraft for years. that would be a fresh new start
@TrixyBlox you should add a school house in a village
Where can u get the map
Map looking like a croissant
Minecraft: I don’t need it I don’t need it I don’t need it I DONT NEED IT...       I neeeeed ittt!
2:59 WTF IS SHE  DOING?! WHAT IS SHE HOLDING?!
u could make a secret at the small island at the ocean, could be a stronghold or a secret lab that continues the story
DUDE 350K LIKES WTHHHH DUDE YOU'RE THE BEST
Literally who has time for this? YOU'RE AMAZING!
I wish you were a Hermit on Hermitcraft...
The world we want: The world we get: *libmya*
Let me know in my comment when it is available. Thank you.
Can we download this map pls ?
I think you hit the 80k likes
God bless you!!!
ok but can we play this
Hi please read this here are some good ideas that are awesome for different dimensions as well like the end and nether maybe make a custom dimension lol  You should add giant mushrooms in the mooshroom biome  Maybe add treehouses to some trees in the jungle biome  Absaloutlet add all the biomes in the nether together and add a nether fortress going threw the nether  Also add the end to one part of each biome for example in the badlands add a end portal on the mines and add the end city blocks instead of obsidian towers and maybe find the elytra by defeating the ended dragon
a dedicated man.
so will tjis be free or some patreon stuff
what is the seed
Cool Project! I can‘t wait for the Next Episode!
I love the idea that you're just making an upgrade, overhaul and stick from the source material of the vanilla Minecraft structures. Not some exaggerated and over designed structures. Just pure aesthetically Minecraft touched upgraded structures.
Ngl village cathedral looks so gothic 👌
Please build some with attack on titan theame
Him: Builds a world but 10 time better  Me: Bearly knows how to make a iron golem
What a LEGEND!
Woooooooooooow
I wish there were seasons
Please one bedrock edition too
In the canyon make some dwarven ruins or dwarven tribes living there.
Someone should make a modded version of this map once its done, with more clever mobs and also with the create mode so windmills can move and all
damn bro, mojang needs to hire you
We are looking for a god of Minecraft
This is fire man! Its so amazing i hope mojang makes this kind of structures and stuff keep it up!
I want the download :((
Do you wanna continu thet
The 1.2K dislikes: the trees that got changed and didn’t like the upgrade  Edit: It’s now 4.9K dislikes :(
I’m sooo hypeddd for thisss
Can We Get The World Downlaod After Finishing All The Works?
Mojang: lets just give up boys
Will you give a file to download the map with only plains???
Do you plan to modify the layout of the other dimensions at all?
I nerd yo download this map now xd
Good job, this is some stellar work!
😍
That island i sussy
pls part 2 :D
So excited to play this once it's finish!
When transforming the ocean area, have a massive beach/shoreline that has some rocks towards the edge that has waves crashing upon them, and then it possibly lead into a little underwater cave. Bondi Beach could be an inspiration 🙌
im sooo excited for this and its a amazing idea
I really need to learn from these videos. This is nuts
Man, I wish the villagers could actually hold weapons. A Villager V Pillager thing would be cool
Will I still be able to play this map without plugins?
Here is my suggestion. Please try to get hired on to Mojang or something. They need your creative mind
I will say that nobody else would:   Can we get a DMC easter egg for no reason?
It looks like an rpg mode but its full detail no teleports and small places
Keep doing this it is great
Looking awesome!
this deserves so much love, the amount of effort put into this, i can feel it, i could never do this
Yooo Join hermitcraft
Holy Moly i cant wait to play this world! probably on a private server with one friend
This is insane! I would never be able to do this
And a doomsday bunker and a floating ship
Im just waiting for someone to make a video and destroythe world
We will watch your career with great interest.
And a nether protector
dude, this map is incredible, also your skill in creating them
Why you don't work at Mojang?!
And a king crab
I phink for the gameplay you could get off the Iron and diamond from the ground, it could be cool if we have to find them in chest oh and dont forget the nether
Minecarft is sooo beautifull
A king dragon
When can i download it???
Amazing, pls continue the project because i think a lot of people wants to download the master piece that this is, including me :)
This is why i still play Minecraft
That cool and please a minecraft  mod
so we can all agree that btow is a good game
10:53
He just straight up build minecraft 2.0
I am so surprised you made it Hand Made Omg
can you add a star wars referance
Yo could you add this to pocket edition? Would be really appreciated
This is actually the coolest thing I’ve ever seen in Minecraft holy shit!
How are you so good at building? I’m fricken amazed
How to dowload
Vikings in the snow biome
please make this map fighting like Ragecraft
I can't wait for more this is amazing....wheres the blacksmith? lol
in the jungle u should build the villages is the trees like treehouses
Add bigfoot
I think u should make a secret underground mine which connects all of the biomes like if you agree
Can i download this??
This gave me the "Open world MMO" like skyrim feeling. nice dude hope you finish this and i play it with my friends
Why haven't Mojang hired you yet?  You should probably be working as a creative director.
You can make a mod with all this!!!
Damn, this looks so cool. I was starting to get bored of MC but seeing this makes me so damn exited to play on this map. Keep up the good work!
MY GOD WOW
Adding special modpacks would make this customized world not even feel like Minecraft
idk why but now I just want to upgrade a whole world, but im just going to give up after 5 mins of doing it tho
But how did ypu do this bro
80k likes? I think you set it too low, or you just like doing this
Huge respect and Honor to you Sir for your dedication and creativeness in Minecraft sending salute from the Philippines
albion!?
me and my cousin played  on a minecraft multiplayer world with just two of us and we found a giant ruined portal someone explain
Will this map be accessable in bedrock version?
get dream  to do a man hunt on this map
aye, that island looks like wano
Reminds me of Zootopia 🐰🦊
Anjay
This Would Be Fun If He Made This A hunger Games
This how minecraft should be, they should revamp the game and make it more adventurous with lots of details and secrets.
Idea: Make the woodland mansion into a castle (Woogland Castle)
TF
And a town hall
Subscibed
How long did this take
dude you should edit the nether and the end too
Wow that was amazing, so much creativity
If vanilla Minecraft always looked this good, I’d probably play it a lot more 😩 That village is awesome
Hey i know im late but how aboat a woodlan mansion
All this is is a ridiculous money making scheme. He’s probably done with the entire map, but will split each section into 12-15 minute videos to make money ( he put 7 fucking ads on a 15 minute video ). He also doesn’t tell anyone that you need money to BUY the map, which means he’s false marketing.
We got you 300k likes, that enough?
"dummies, you dummy" Secret message
Yo I want so much play to this map  !!!
Perfect world
Trixy is the interior of building also redesigned?
Can you also add the Stronghold, please... Btw: wow
Make a secret statue of my logo 🙏 please
Absolutely spectacular
Da baby minecraft map 0:01
can it be free i don't got no mine coins
THIS DUDE IS SO UNDERRATED🔥
wish vanilla minecraft actually looked like this.. honestly mojang should just hire trixy and have him design new structures for the next big update after caves and cliffs.
Trixy CAN you make the snow biom viking themed?
i want to play in this world
BUILD CITIES AND HAVE THEM FIGHT
If i even spawn into the map my computer would explode
Soo if you dont put modes and new itens i shall say...its uselles
This may be controversial, is this downloadable for the bedrock version?
I dont know how- but I wanna do something like this
I hope it is not too demanding but could you make a secret cave base/hideout behind a waterfall?
@Azrealon bisa gak?
"I stayed true to the design" Me: That looks better than my main survival house world
good artwork!
Villager also shock this my house
holy shiyttt 😵
I could build this...                        Is what i would say if i was good at building
Wtf my man doesnt have eyelashes on one eye. 14:30
Add a nether aversion where you can go to trough The portal.
Can I get a map of this World 🌎🌎 please upload this is an simply incredible

You should create railways between the villages so the wood and materials from other areas makes sense. :)
Zelda inspiration in plains biome: Me: I LOVE THAT GAME OMG OMG OMG OMG Me 5 seconds later writing this comment:          noice.
Im really impressed. I was getting kind of Lord of the Rings, Skyrim and Zelda vibes from the way you designed things. From those vibes maybe you can make like a ginormous Mother tree in the center of the map that has like a glowy heavenly type of feel to it, kind of like the whole island grew from that point I guess. Or a monster dungeon, dragon lair. idk just a weird thought I got from seeing the unique Island design, keep up the great work. Looking forward to more
I can't express in words how amazing this is
why don't you make a rickroll reference
Hey TrixyBlox! I'm sure that this is just the beginning for your massive numbers. Like, this deserves sooo much attention, and i'm so happy for you that it's getting it. Oh and... the like goal is most definetly reached already... Anyways, i can't wait to see the results of this massive project!!!

Can it be that you like towers
You should make a prison island kinda like alcatraz. If you wanna get a little extra spicy with it, make it an abandoned prison with dead inmates (zombies) and you can make it a dungeon experience

OMG brother your work is amazing I want to play when you finish it !
NO NONONO
YOOO!!!! this is gonna be so sick!!!!!!!!
*“This upgrade stays pretty true to the original, mostly with pretty minor changes being made”*  *Turns library into completely different building*
Get SystemZ to mod this for u, like for example adding more mobs and making villagers more realistic and intractable while also adding some sort of village militia instead of an iron golem since it would be unrealistic for a small village to get enough iron and tools to make an iron golem, so for the iron golem u could make a fortified abandoned fortress that is only filled with iron golems and loot as its old residents who built the iron golems died long ago. I could also add dungeons of different variants with spawners in every corridor under the carpet or something to make it seem as if they are naturally generating or u can just mod in custom spawners. As for the thing about villager interaction, u would definitely need to mod the game for the idea u got for the jungle biom, since villagers don't interact with other villages and don't fight each other, that would just ruin the feel of it and make the game feel dead, so making villagers more realistic would be cool and maybe having villagers travel from one village to the other to trade resources as well but that might be too much modding. For now one small thing u could easily mod is the trees spawning by themselves and saplings spawning the new variant of trees u made.
Yo mans made fucking mata nui or some bionicle shit thats nuts
What if you made a massive underground secret ancient base that you would find somewhere in the jungle
How much time it takes to do it 🕑
That’s amazing!!
I WANT MORE
The builds are sick but i think you've forgotten a blacksmith
team trees would be so proud 3:44
i know what i have idea its called abandon treasure castle and ship and village in the secret cave and the surface
You are a Lucky one, the algorithm helped you, but in a good way because I think you earn it

Hello can you give me the map because it looks epic and soooo cooooooooool
@TrixyBlox will you put the giant pyramid in the map?
Kek

You should make the map fell more older than it is by adding abandoned campsites,old buried houses,graves,frozen mobs inside the ice in the snow biome.
L
OK.
80k likes? my man set his sights a bit short, sitting at 341k likes rn.
FOOTBALL PITCH!!
Can’t wait for this
ok ok listen to my idea we put the map into vr and make it look like sao
Thumbnail sus
cool this is amazing. it just looks like a typical Legend Of Zelda world
Can you make a mod with this map pls?
Given that this madlad has given flags to the pillagers and villages, you could conceivably have some of them related, implying nations or military outposts and expeditions.  As suggestions, perhaps a ruined portal in a different architectural style in one of the other biomes? It seems fitting for the desert temple perhaps, or near a desert lava pit.  Finally: ruined towers. Pillager, Wizard, watchposts, or chapels of forgotten religion.  The æsthetic of abandoned or destroyed buildings and settlements is a trend, and agile you mentioned a zombie overrun village in the jungle (great idea, by the way) it would be interesting to see other environments. Perhaps a tower on a cliff side wasn’t secure, and you create the ruined foundation and fallen rubble from the rockslide that toppled it.
You should build a gigantic volcano
Imagine Mojang hire you to rebuild every structure and to create new structures for them. That'll be sick
can we get the map download link?
Wtf this is soo awesome i think that vilage would Look litle bit better whit More Houses but i am not sure
Ive always loved to build in minecraft. But ...How do you net get bored? How do you not lose focus on what you are building? Whats what happens to me often , I simply lose interest in the build and now I have 17 or some projects just laying about.
Wow
You Need a Never give you up rickroll secret
Kinda reminds me of wynncraft <<
Feels like valheim mixed with hytale
epik, also you can add a Ravager Stable to the Pillager Outposts
I have an idea for the lore of the world, like a god or gods I was on the idea that ever place have a god
how can i download it?
The best
wow
Maybe make a hidden Nordic temple underground area in the snow biome
I hope you fully utilize the potential of underground builds in this world as well. Having a sort of "Korok" system would also be amazing. For example: there could be 16 player heads, golden buttons, or rabbit feet with nicknames in each biome.
rdr2 in minecraft 0_0
THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!
They should add all of this it is sooo good

You should really make the buildings into a data pack they can spawn in every world, i would really love that
INSANE, so we will be able to download this, for free!?
you know the villagers are gonna go to the closest bed and not their own houses right? But this is epic
IM SO HAPPY I FOUND YOU SO DOWNLOADING THIS WHEN IT COMES OUTT CANT WAIT FOR THE STORYLINE AND THE BUILDS
bruh your so talented its so good
SO COOL I WANT PLAY PLS!
It would be cool if you added some mods that would make it so whatever you put in the snow biome would be special to this map or just stuff that would be special anywhere, not sure what mods you would use or make but it would make it a bit more interesting I think. Like for example for the "beekeeper" villager, a mod would be cool to make that villager into an actual beekeeper and that wouldn't be that difficult seeing as all you would have to do is make it a custom NPC with a name and then change the trades and it would add a lot more of the whole emersion you want. Also, custom trades for certain merchants would be cool and maybe you could even make storylines with that like you said you wanted to.
I have a idea for a secret there should be very hidden buttons all over the map on diffrent locations  and if ypu press them in a certain order you will find a giant underground village
The sloppy dahlia partly choke because hygienic preoperatively print from a gaudy newsstand. sticky, graceful doctor
This is amazing!!!

th amount of subs your getting is insane you gained 20000 subs in one night
Can't wait to play the map!
Merci
If you want to add some obscure realism build the snowy houses on stilts. You could also add some that aren’t but are modern or destroyed/abandoned (explanation below don’t waste brain cells if you don’t want to).   In areas with permafrost houses are regularly built on stilts to prolong their lifetime the reason for this is because the heat from the houses transfers to the ground heating up the permafrost causing it to expand this will destroy houses possibly even several in a street.
Woooow, I want to try this map🙀
where i can download the map?
You could build a Zelda map into it
im thinking how much hours do you use for that
The map is a pd paradise logo. Just me? Ok🙏😔😔
Pls give us the link also for bedrock
deep underground add a gundam that’s being built would be pretty sick
In new zealand you can go from a snowy mountain straight to a desert
You should add giant statues of different animals that suit the different biomes
How long did this take you?
I think some builds in the Nether would be damn cool, can’t wait for the result
Can you add mod in this even tho i dont have pc to play this map

If the developers actually sees this, after three years or so (i think) , they will make this whole thing real
where can i download this map?
This is by far the best map I have seen anyone build and it's not even finished! I love the idea and can't wait for the rest of the episodes. I think that a secret chamber type thing connected to a witches hut somewhere would be really cool. (:
Make so people can download it
what wrong with  your eye brown
He should be minecraft's official builder
Mate u can add fire place in the ice biome to provide warmth and travelling shops around the world to make it more purposeful and adding vine yard would be awesome (fyi most of these ideas are form the game genshin impact )👍🏻🔥 have fun building 🎗️

Mojang, hire this man!
I found you on yt on my tv while watching with my younger siblings. We all love the idea of you making this and adding more detail to the structures and biomes, can’t wait to play this map!!!
awesome man, keep up the great work 😍😍
Next video: hello guys, today we build Earth
if you’re taking suggestions, it would be cool to transform one village into more of a town, like with concrete floors and proper roads and loads of houses, and maybe a canal system. This is so amazing i can’t wait for the next one
This would be such an amazing map to roleplay in
This is beautiful

This is just amazing!
*Sad Mobile player noises*
Ham kaise khele ohh
It would be a small cute touch to find a tiny snowman in the middle of the snowy mountains with a short story of the adventures of a snow golem.  Just a happy thing to find in the middle of the frozen hills.
Will the download be available for mcpe
This is so good man ur insane
Dude you have to continue this project! It's just awesome, I can't wait to download the complete map

Your buildings go beyond building. You deserve more subs for your effort into these videos!
there could be a crashed wagon and bones in the bottom of the canyon in the wild west
i need that map
I wonder how this guys still only have a million sub. This guy should have a 10 million sub. I mean come on, this is just freaking cool
That looks like amphibia...
I saw this on reddit
The obese radio prenatally crack because handle realistically replace after a youthful sneeze. physical, accidental walrus
so when can i play on it
i think you should create a swamp town that have a masion or like a big village house for a witch then create a dungeon under so we can have a action (i hope i can download this world)🥰
Why didn't minecraft hire this guy ?
THIS IS SOOOOO GOOD OMG!!!
This is how you play a creative mode !
Omg I have so many ideas I will definitely use this for a survival world but hopefully it will be on mobile.
This annoys me as I know MINECRAFT will not actually do this. 😤
Really Nice.!
I’m planning to use this world for an SMP with countries and wars etc. Great work!! :)))
underrated dude

your build is super hard and you build many block like 16,000,000 block you need a robot and it so fast to build it. this robot can click so fast and hack, you haft to tell him what ever you wanted :).
Next up the nether and end?
Ngl.That looks super realistic then real life
Can you make it for a PlayStation

Meteor landing would be cool
how do you get into the Minecraft map
I sim
Since fnf is getting popular, what about in one of the biomes there will be an abbandoned fnf stage?
Coral reef
You could have kept the width of the church the same as the original or maybe expand it by up to 4 blocks, while increasing the height.. Many European country side churches have that sort of long and slim look too them while still having quit the height and of cause a bell tower that sticks above the surrounding area (usually), so it could easily work. The wide sort of building like you made is definitely more what would be constructed in a large city where it was expected that a large audience would be present for each sermon and thus extra seating in the sides would be necessary, could still be a church but not the sort that would be built in a small or try side city, since the extra width is just wasted time and resources if there’s already enough space for everyone.
Nice work!
The thumbnail is  Amogus
What minecraft should look like:
They need to hire this man for the next minecraft update 💯

I saw u on Reddit (or a someone who copied u) (or u copied them)
Plot Twist: He's A Creator Of Sword Art Online Alicization Underworld Map :v
These builds actually give a feel from link the legend of Zelda
Minecraft literally needs more upgrades than Terraria
I found this because of the youtube algorithm.  Maybe add an Easter egg based around this?
You should add custom mobs to for this map
Hey, can you upload the world so people can download it?

Just your talent of building in Minecraft inspires me but i’m no where good at building like you
What. The. Hell. 😧😧😧
Map download link pleaseee
Dude the map really reminded me of subnautica map, i would really like to see an entire like story mode on this lol, with deep long lore but still mostly no npcs like subnauticas
Hey Trixy! Quick reminder, you can use Void Blocks to hold Waterfalls in Shape, and you can even walk through! Its easy to figure out how to get them, there are alot of Tutorials for the Command. Hope this helps!  Edit: The Command is:  /give @p minecraft:structure_void
Keep going!
This is amazing and mindblowing! You are such an inspiration. Also would really love to see the world being playable, sheesh.
you only did the plains
And pls add a traveler pls to be more like a mmorpg
You are best
This should be a mod
He had me at Bob Ross reference
Honestly speaking here, this project looks like one of the best projects I have seen in Micecraft in many years
what is the name of the application you are using
Ngl, i would like to see some slave merchant in some big town. Probably wont be happening but please add some broke traveling wagon perhaps in some forest
Sad only ok?
Beautiful ❣️
I think it would be cool if you make a colossal central tree in the forest/ plains, and adapt it for the other biomes like a giant mushroom for the mushroom island
Dude this vid has 300k likes why the fuck do u need to be patron or something this is like a lot of money can u please make it free
Hey can you make a mod an texture pack when you release this? For example the mod can make all trees your custom trees and take longer to grow and custom villager trades skins items and etc since you're making a huge project why not make it the best project
Just one thing tho - The world looks so beautiful that I guess no one would like to break even a single block off it xD
The available shop specifically type because thursday unlikely nod down a unkempt attraction. quarrelsome, thinkable carnation
Hey Trixy, first of all you did a very good job and the map looks already incredible good, but what i would like for the map would be that it is a bit more like minecraft, for example i mean the trees should be just completely out of logs, and not out of half slabs and fences, and thats actually the only thing i wish for, but still very well done!
Looks so amazing! Will it be server compatible???
I think you should make a pillager and villager tree house and make an abandoned pillager house think thats cool right...?
How do I download this map?
Can u do full breath of the wild map if u can 🤣🤣🤣
So dope and kinda like a mmorpg heh😂
If the villagers villages looked like in this movie, everyone would live in them.
Hhhhmmmm what is the hardest building on minecraft that u build😐😓
Definitely make some sort of Lab or otherworldly research site related to the nether and the End
Idea: you should make a dungeon under the jungle temple and traps with it
Very niceeeeee🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
It would be nice if there is a deep and complex network of caves in frozen mountains
Dude i dont even know who you are, you just got in my recommended and i am not disappointed this is awesome i left sub and like
Wow this is awsome but i have one suggestion. I think the farmlands you made for that village were too small. They were about the size of the area covered by the houses if not smaller. I once read that in the middle ages there was about a 1 to 10 ratio between farmlands and actual cities so it would be nice to see much bigger fields. For more information you can read the wikipedia article https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_the_Middle_Ages
Where will you put the strong hold just a question
Wouldn’t the villagers be killed by zombies pretty quickly
There is a reason why this video has 15% of the views, likes... (rare)
13: 43 which shaders bro please tell fast
is it just me? or I think that he must or should make this a server like rpg or survival thing.
Birch Forest?
You're such a legend man.
0:45 why does it look like he doesn’t have eyelashes
It would be a nice if you add more little randome islands
Seed?
Please give download link in Minecraft pocket edition
I love the feel of the upgraded plains biome, but you forgot about the swamp biome edit: also maybe a volcano or a small nether?
It is very cool
I will have this Map Please give me this map. PS: Really nice build
a city would be cool
cool beanz man
I’d love for you to include a faster means of transportation for such a massive world
Brush your teeth
Mojang! hire this guy! seriously I hope this download comes out, so can play it and do a video series
They need to hire this guy, i subscribed just to support this project
Wow
Why does this look like the Real Pixelated Kingdomrush Vengeance?
The legendary castle of the end
why would anyone press the dislike button after this video?
This man really build a croissant world huh
Put herobrine in a cave
WOW! Thats coolest map i see ever
This is so freakin cool
Cool
My suggestion is maybe you could add a couple mods to make the game more RPG like, since the vanilla game tends to lack a lot of depth and makes custom maps not as great as they could be. The vanilla game tends to cater best to random generation and because of the random nature of the terrain generation there’s not a lot of area specific rewards to incentivize exploring the whole map and all of the best gear in the game is made to be easily achievable no matter where you are in the world. So maybe some mods with custom weapons and enemies and what not which raise the peek difficulty of the game would incentivize players to explore in order to find better loot quickly. Some areas would be harder so you could really only enter them if you have good enough loot and once you’re able to survive in the area you’ll gain even better loot and be able to enter even harder areas and so the game gets progressively harder but never too hard or easy!  There’s definitely and alternative approach to do this kind of thing but it would definitely be a whole lot harder and I don’t think it would end up being quite as fun but in any case I’m sure you’ll find a way to make it work and I’m really excited to play the finished product!
You should make a boss battle i think
We're all waiting for part 2
dear TrixyBlox ,   pls do Attack On Titan  , ill subscibe thankyou
Wich seed ??
Suggestion: break some of the stone bricks on the ruined portal stairwell for more of that "ruined" vibe. Love the builds man. Hope that Mojang sees this and integrate some of it into the real game.
Amazing
And will it be free if it’s in the store as I have no tomens
Does the texture pack come with it?
hope u get job from mojang keep it up, ur videos are amazing.
A volcano could be cool
Maybe you could add some sort of rituals in the snow biome for gods from norse mythology, for example a big hammer which resembles the hammer of thor(mjölnir)
can we download this plz
Lets goooooo
pls tell seed
imagine how cool it would be to make an mmo rpg server on this world
When’s the next episode ?
You should transform it’s nether too
Dude, now imagine making this a PVE map, and adding custom mobs and bosses, and missions, HOOOOOly Damn that it would be a legendary map. This is 100% going down in the history books.
Why does the thumbnail look like the spell break map
A bit out of context but can the BSL shaders be used on bedrock?
How do i download this??
What about an underwater cave with axolotl
You look like the adult version of Dustin from stranger things bruh
This looks amazing!! Can't wait to see more!

DUDE IMAGINE SOMEONE LITERALLY MAKE THIS PROJECT INTO OPEN WORLD STORY GAME
genshin impact
Cant wait to play this
I dont think that anything AT ALL has more potential then this map.
it annoys me that you put a savannah next to a taiga. savannahs are hot and taigas are cold. they should've had a forest or something in between
Hold on you forgot about the end portal and also can you upgrade the nether to pls?
I feel like there should be like some sorta city like thing (like New York or something like that) but idk if it would fit in with any of the biomes
add some special abbilites mobs
You forgot a blacksmith in the planes village
SUBBED
A free roam adventure map? This is going to be amazing!!!
Can i live there?
I think a pillage will be great  A pillage will be like village but It will have pillagers in place of villagers and ravagers instead of iron golem
This is so sick u should make it available for all to play on as a downloadable world once its done looks so fun......
What is that texture pack
The spiritual son inherently improve because newsprint july risk except a tedious robin. sticky, bright basement
Trixy: **Makes everything better in Minecraft** Me: *Can't even build a simple house*
OMG i need this map !!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow really nice project you have sub
You should colab with jeracraft!!!
This guy can be a architect
I can't wait for people to speed run this
Wait, this'll be available for free download???
You are a goddamn architecht
Superb
This type of map would be so good for a mmorpg type of game like wynncraft. With all of the cool builds and the buge terrain it really would be cool as a server that works as a mmorpg or adventure game.
Congrats you have a new subscriber😋😋😋
I can't wait to sea the jungle
imagine you are a Minecraft developer
oh god please tell me i can download this!
Would you allow me to use this world download for survival content? (With mentions of course)
This is look so SICKKKKKK
How about a couple of hidden shrines. Notch for the villagers and Herobrine for the illagers.
Next mountains/taiga pls!! Make only 1 village for the 2 biomes. With  letherworkers, hunters and miners
satisfying 🤩😍😍🤩
it’d be really cool if the stronghold was in the snowy mountains, and that there are stories about monsters to ward off travellers
https://youtu.be/IqqIV8x82Qc
I love you now I am your subscriber
MAKE A MOD THAT IS LIKE BOTW OR OTHER ADVENTURE GAMES LIKE A TEMPERATURE CHANGE ON SPECIFIC PLACES LIKE THE DESERT OR TUNDRA ( or not idk i kinda just want more adventure and also pls include the nether too???
For me I would like to make this world into an rpg world. Pairing up with story writers, programmers, and artists is a really good idea. The writer will give out the story, connecting the quests, making out classes, and more. The programmer will carry and implement all that. The artist would create the more swords, more armors, designing them into a more rpg style. Plus I think this would be really supported by the community. So with all that good job for making this elaborate world sir.
Let's get this to 80,000 likes!! 3 days later, 300,000 likes..
Woah this is amazing!!!!
You are god of minecraft building
If i had a pc i would play in this map also subbed since 30k cant believe youve gone this far congrats !
Omg I can’t wait for pt2 this is guna be epic
Man, I kinda wanna learn to build...
This is what I've been looking for in my entire life. I've always wanted a MC world  where everything looks detailed or upgraded like it won't look that far from the original
Once i get my first gaming pc i definitely download this map.

nvm
Since I've played and beaten breath of the wild multiple times I can definitely see how a lot of this is similar/inspired by it! I loved the temple of time inspiration btw!
SOOO excited for the rest omg
On the top of the tallest mountain, u should place an imaginary flag of the plains tribe.
Fortnite Chapter 3 Map??? LMAO
Omg, I finally have something interesting to watch!!! YESSSSS. THIS LEGIT SO EXCITING

Will it be on bedrock as well? Or not because I'd love to play it
This is actually sick

After seeing this video, who of you wants to build an own world like this too? 🤣
absolutely stunning. but you forgot the blacksmith
Over 80,000
Please include totem and op opportunity books in  treasure chests  an love your videos
Wow how did you learn how to do all this?!?!?! Your awesome and I love your style
When can we play this awesome map?
Good making
I wish you can have 1m sub

When caves and cliffs fully comes out you should do an underground area
First time finding your videos, and I'm shitting my balls off my nigga this shit is capital
How can we download this
Add a custom wood land mansion
Question when it's out will it be available for xbox one s too
Oh hey, just me who doesn't have World Painter : D
How to make the plains even better: create mod and better villagers
very clean creation m8
This would be so awesome to play with my friends in a survival world.  What I suggest and would really love, is to add some dungeons with loot, like a sharpness VI sword or something not that crazy, but good enough to encourage exploration and travelling long distances to see the entire map.
any dev here? make this into a random generated world lmao sorry I know it's hard but, for the community!
For the mountains, I think it would be sick if you built either an Erebor(from Lord of the Rings) style base inside the mountain or  a cabin in the woods style house with modern elements that goes in the middle of the cliff side like Malibu mansion from iron man.  You could also do many hallways and dungeons that connect multiple parts of the desert, similar to the lost river in subnautica.  Then you could make the terrain very dangerous on the desert surface so the player is forced to explore through the dungeons to access the deserts point of interests easier.  You could also put aqua-ducts that lead to the temple.
Make a giant floating eye.
Impressive. Wish I had that sort of creative mind. :)
wow! amazing job!
we need an astronaut in the ocean
Why did 1K people dislike this video this is a masterpiece like just why
Add a giant Aztec style pyramid on the jungle biome
You know the videos amazing when you get hyped 2 minutes in.
For the plain area you should of put some military camps or bases
Its amazing but can u add the ruined portal chest
Download link?
The only thing I want u to do it is plz make it available in Bedrock edition
How to download this map???
I know its a survival map but you should add a story mode / campaign thingy
I hope I can download this map and start to survive like Legend of zelda wilder with my friend but with some custome code from command block...😀😀
THIS... THIS.. THIS IS WHAT WE NEEDED IN 2020
I love this
This is massive
That'd be so amazingtobe able to play in such a map!!!
This is unreal! It’s just astonishing!  Minor suggestion: you should add scattered structures around the map. Like tents or small houses
Noice and the villagers are proud of ur re-designing lol
Is there a earth landing?
Yall better like this shit lol
SO COOOOOL
Oh my god what an adventure map I could build on this...
Wow I can't build a single not ugly house
Would like to see swamp biome
Link download map plis
7:27 pillagers:     :D 7:56 pillagers:     :(

HOW DO YOU RELOCATE AN ENTIRE BUILD IN SECONDS WHATTTT
Do Snowy Tigas next pls
Beautiful
pog
OMG you will share the map for download please! but it would be played!
An old abandoned lab under the mushroom byome
Can you make a replica map of Runeterra (the league of legends world)??
Idea! In the Wild West or any other mine(s). Make a skull over some cobblestone and dirt and a book around there, explaining how the guy got trapped in there and how he came in the mines. I had an idea for the story but if it makes in the game I don’t want to spoil it. Nice project.  Another idea : At the snowy biome, a native/Indians village with in one of the huts there’s something about the wendigo; and if you go to the biome under the snowy, you can see something like a deer skull, the main part is a skeleton skull and the brown parts are dark oak fences!
If i did that i would make a mrbeast shop
can i download the map?
i wanna play the maap very baaaaaadly
Hello is any one there
this is like rdr2 vibes
at some point this reminded me of that really complex sarcastic building video 😭 Edit: amazing builds tho
subbed, i would love to play this map on survival with my friends
i guess you can put an abandoned mining village in the snowy mountains and a cabin
looks absolutely amazing so far, keep it up!

Me: oh so I’m guessing there’s gonna be a build team  “I’m working on this map completely alone” Me:  YOU WHAT!
I wish minecraft was like this
Now make this into a mod pack so we can play with these builds not in a map, but in a randomly generated seed
What about caves and mining
The plains will be basic not that crazy     I'm amazed beyond words
Bro this in shaders and rl craft is gunna be so flippin epic
Here's an idea for the jungle biom,  it should have a waterfall that comes from a river and falls into a lake and there is something special behind the waterfall. (Sorry if you didn't get whet i ment😅)

Give me the seed
Wow, when trixy make this minecraft world it looks like fortnite map😋😋

Minecraft: New Age

A abandoned futuristic laboratory in the arctic could be used for a story in the arctic
POV : u r seeing the sunset on this map
Why those this look like it could be in 1.17 in Minecraft 👁👄👁
Can you please give link of map
Can we download that,?...Pls,?
For an idea of a build: Get a lot of your favourite builds you have made and add them todether to make an adventure map, it will mostly be worldpainter to move things around so the building element of the project would be making the building survival friendly with buildings and maybey npc’s
ur the best builder
what if i add rebirth of the night with this
A secret underground cult focusing on Pepe would be a nice Easter egg/Side storyline
That’s absolutely amazing 🤩 I really like the inspiration from Zelda, because I played this too ^^
This is super impressive gj man
Mojang be lyk: write it down write it down!
Wait what am I playing again?
Broooo this so cool
Bro this is beautiful. plus love how you got inspiration from BoTW
The world gives me vibes from an anime called mushoku tensei
Hey can you make a biggest mountain in Minecraft ever made for the treasure adventure....
Can I download this on xbox?
What happened when TrixyBlox working with JeraCraft or the other way around
I swear if you decorated the nether and the end too I'd cry of happiness
You should do a let’s play of this when you are done
This is EPIC
Masterpiece
Can you send map
where can i download this??
I think someone should really make some kind of special mod dedicated to this map, that would go really well with all the stories you're planning to add, and it would honestly be really cool if the cleric could sell some nice modded items once in a while :D
This awesome can't wait to play
Can u plis try to make a bedrock download to
From the thumbnail i thought it was Wano island and onigashima from one piece
Trixy, you should make an ice castle! Congratulations on one mil
Lol my pc will explode in seconds after downloading the map
"Amogus Island"
“Get this vid to 80k likes”                                 Three days later: 300k likes.                           Trixy seeing that: “Damn”

Giant Poseidons hand reaching out of the water with a massive trident in it?
it would be really cool to do an avatar type thing in the jungle.  Like a really ridiculously sized tree that could be the village.
this could make for a great pvp map
This looks EPIC!!!
Minecraft is flat
Did I love these videos. How long does it take you to do transformations like this? Love the work man, keep it up!
Why does it look like a brain?
Link download pls
@Azrealon harus coba sih....
Yea that looks more like a cathedral than a church..
You should add a dragon in a mountain
What is the seed ???😕
@azrealon harus coba yg kyk gini sih....
wait first time watching your video..... do you have a glass eye? your left eye pupol looks like bigger and darker than the other.
This world will not be able to be played in bedrock right?🥺
Dude I think this project just might be too beautiful to use as a true survival world. More like a base for an adventure map or something if you ask me.
The map reminds me of aot (attack on titan) Reminds me of paradis if you put walls around in the middle
OMG that's amazing!
Minecraft is now like an RPG game now and i LOVE IT
A legend says: Zelda's Dad is still up in the church.
Damn that farmer lives better than me
New subcriber
maybe transform those spawner thingies
This guy should make a server with a fantasy theme. More fantasy then minecraft itself
What is the seed......
I really want to play and download this map so badly.
i CANNOT wait for the finish product this already looks absolutely amazing! cant wait to play it!
This is the first video I've watched from you and while impressive I do have some questions:  Why are you still asking for "likes" for the release of your next video, if you make great content then people will like and subscribe and you won't need to ask.  You said you have been making videos for 8 years. Yes, you have but unless you have removed videos you have only started becoming active in the past year. Don't get me wrong it is an impressive year and hopefully the subscribers have been from that activity.  You have charisma and the building ability in creative but personally I would like to see what you bring to the table as a survival and server content creator.  I wish all the best in your progression, I have subscribed because of this video and in ways seeing you being compared to the likes of Grian, Bdub and Scar, hopefully you know them.
Just an idea if you haven’t thought of it, fo upgraded underground structures like the stronghold, dungeon, mineshaft, ravine or cave
You impress me,you deserve much more than 1 million.
Imagine if that's the vanilla world generation... It's much more natural similiar to REAL LIFE when c0mpared to
Ahoj, jak se máte ?
I want to download the map
80000 likes and you finish it. It’s 320k likes right now. Where’s the map?
After completing  gimme tha download link!!!
When you finish you should do a 100 days series on it
Bro i want my friend to stream this twitch

Looks like a lily pad.
This would be awesome to play in!

This will be amazing
Hi
Can you do PUBG map in Minecraft like pochinki,shanhok,mylta,etc.....😭😭😭😘😘😘😘😘😘
you should create in the mountain biomes a couple broken down cleric wagons where now there are witches all around because of the clerics potions and weird wacky stuff
photoshop
He just upgraded from android to iOS
This is crazy man!
0:01 Minecraft is not Minecraft anymore
always the masterpieces are gainful.
that was phenomenal
i can't wait to play this but i do not have a paetron account and i only download maps from planetminecraft website
Whers the seed?
You forgot about the mansion.
make the spruce village and make the minnir ditails bigger btw you are the best minecraft player and builder and keep up the content!.
wow i think that took 3 months
extremely well hidden subscribe button :)
you could add a little underground area occupied by a mysterious cult or something?? amazing builds tho
I would like to see a giant skeleton ancient of some creature in the Mountain, Ocean, Desert or Mushroom biome. That would be cool.
STONEHENGE! 🤭🤭🤭
can we have the map? :>
BOTW 2 lookin great
Yoooo this is so cool, keep it up man
bro all of ur build are cool ur the god of building in minecraft even me cant defeat u if 1v1 building competition hahahahahhahahaha
How long did this take
OK. we can all agree somewhere on the island there needs to be an Attack On Titan type of MASSIVE wall that goes around something right?
did like 5 seconds of googling, the entire map is about 50% bigger than Russia
Things that are still missing  -Desert Biome Transforming -Mesa Biome Transforming -Savanna Biome Transforming -Taiga Biome Transforming -Snowy Mountains Biome Transforming -Dark Wood Forest Biome Transforming -Jungle Biome Transforming -Mushroom Biome Transforming -Ocean Monument Transforming -Shipwreck -A Map-Themed Texture Pack -The Map Lore
Maybe add an Illusioner boss fight in the dark oak
custom nether world
This is so damn cool, can't wait.
A quaint windmill- never thought I'd hear that
"So I did some building off camera" 😂😂😂
I love this so much
This would be amazing if Minecraft actually used these ideas. This is amazing work A+
this map + a modpack based around the Create mod. would be epic
when this project finish i want pewds to play it
This seems like something you'd see in a 3D terraria. With so many biomes in such an interesting layout. Perhaps near the ruined portal could lay a ruined castle? From a kingdom that once used the portal before its fall.  I think there should be a massive nether project as well.
You could add a hermit hut or two in each biome in a secluded area, so that it would be sort of like an easter egg, but also fill in a bit of the emptiness of the biomes, since the map is twice the intended size.
The thumbnail looks like an indian thali
Add some small rowboats and pirate ships so villagers have rowboats and then you can find pirates on their ships
is this map too on bedrock version?
Damn, thats a lot of adderral
Yuuu this Is like the anime wee like about it would be good aswell if there is an NPC that we can get quest and some other monster that drops loots that can't be crafted AHHHH
Legend of Alex place of The wild
How shesssshhhh
I officially dub thee as the best YouTuber to watch at 2am
80 tausend hmmm i think thats low
Make an illager town and a witch village!
Damn dude, this is incredible!
Can you make a musjid for muslims plz
what is this seed i want to try it
Maybe a dragon?
Consider putting an old abandoned mansion in the snowy mountains, a lot like the Snowpeak Ruins in The Legends of Zelda Twilight Princess.
YOO HOW DID YOU RECORD THIS DOESN'T YOUR COMPUTER KILL ITSELF
Can you pleeeease make a world download?
First off i have no idea how you edit this world like that but dang that’s great! And second how long did this take??
I can see this as a custom survival map called the Island lol
Yooooo 🔥
how about something like easter egg like there's a hidden cave or an island where there's a room like the purpose is to monitor what you're doing like and there's a custom villager there with the name of the creator of the map managing the room and other people who helped you creating it with some bonus items for finding it
you should be one of the minecraft developer
Make a link for this world plsss this so awesome
Seems great for a battle royale sort of thing with friends.
The inspiration in breath of the wild works perfectly this is just amazing!
Random subscribers names around the map would be sick (like myself)
I'm playing AC Valhalla with this on my 2nd monitor, and when it said "Knockout, You win" at 14:00 I had just knocked someone out with a fist. Amazing.
Where will you put it so we can download it!?🤔
80k likes wow, what a joke
yellow teeth moment
Can we be able to download this map to bedrock and pe please
Mushroom biome
Holy crap, this is insane!! The village looks incredible. My idea is to make the ruined portal emphasize the idea that the nether is expanding into the overworld, I think that’s the original intent for it, lore wise. It would also be really cool if you did some stuff in the nether/end, perhaps something in the sky??
This looks and sounds so incredibly awesome that i immediately liked, subscribed and rang the bell because i want to see *a l l * of this
The plains remind me about aot (attack on titan)
Map download plisss
313k likes in 4 days. that's a lot.
god damn what I'd do to get a download link for this map
I wonder if this will be available in all versions of minecraft
The 1k who disliked were bots
😱 omg I should've see this earlier this is a massive inspiration, Imma make a village on my survival server like that thanks men
Please make the villages center tree bigger
oh men i wish you are the game developer on minecraft lol
This looks amazing it looks soooooo  good.
This is absolutely stunning oh my god I love your building style so much it fills my heart with joy
Flat earthers designing their minecraft world.
This some BOTW type beat
Maybe you can use this as battle royale.
Mojang should hire this guy
When you release the map could you also put it on curseforge pls would be nice 😄
Wow!!! I suggest Mountain chains like Himalayas or the Andes
Hey trixy, it would mean a lot if you could maybe add some sort of nod to red dead redemption in the mess biome. I think many people would really love that and I can promise it would bring you more fans
A back to the future Delorean I the Mesa
Looks like the villagers won't work our way
Saw this on reddit
He's making minecraft into red dead
been watching since dan tdm's base transformation!! congratulations on reaching 1M!!
Can this be converted to bedrock?
The omniscient watchmaker broadly suspend because birthday subcellularly heal to a obedient baker. gaudy, numberless chair
hire this man mojang
How to download this map ?
pls download world
I just found this channel today for the 1mil special and now I got some catching up
An Idea for the snowy biome: could you include a huge crystal cave with a dragon skull inside and inside the skull there is a treasure chest (with whatever you want inside of it) and to access the treasure chest you need to get a diary with cords to the crystal cave.
Maybe a alibaba cave can work too love ur work
*cough* *cough* make hell biome *cough*
I mean like old school mode
This is dope
Applause 👏 tooo beautiful
@TrixyBlox Does This map work in Cracked Mincraft? Love Your Vids!!
Wow, this is amazing! I'm so glad I clicked on this video. You just earned a subscriber, and I'm excited to see the next part of this project!
This is so sick! Youre so creative cant wait for the snow biom tbh!
Is there a way I can download this map?
When  trixy gave us creative and let us visit hes world  People: *brings out tnt* Trixy:b r u h
Will this work on Bedrock edition?
Add random skulls around the map so it looks like people used to be on the island! Also can you build a abandoned village but its harder to find items like you have to mine / dig up stuff to find items and the loot is MUCH better than normal loot for villages.
The amount of effort and planning put out to this single map is insane
He said he wanted 80
Bruh in 3 days he got 300k likes
This is interesting and cool as all hell
I liked and subscribed because this is epic
Make it a Map so that everyone can play with it, ITS SO BEAUTIFUL
I can't wait to play this custom map amazing bro
can u maybe add indian temples in the jungle biomes
Masterpiece ⭐
This is cool asf but bro brush your teeth 💀
Heres things: new mobs, a bigfoot, custom bosses, new blocks, titanic shipwreck kraken and more!
I've never seen this channel before it just popped up in my recommended I watched two minutes of this video and subscribed
I want to play in that world lol
Somewhere on the map, there needs to be a Zelda style dungeon
me the vid just plays randomly  also me Jeracraft changed voice realising its another channel this is how this comment existed
Bro why does the island look sus
i wish he create that on my world ☺
Smashed the goal A little just a tiny bit
Imagine this map but underground is the massive caves and his massive underground castle build from his other video
Lets all agree that trixy is the best youtube builder
These should be added to mc lol
I almost don't want to see the rest of the videos until the map is up on the patreon page. I feel like it would ruin the surprise.
Sana all
My plan is put a secret bunker
This would make for a good dnd campaign
Do you have data packs for your structures?
And I thought making map art was hard
These all is fantastic and gorgeous.... Until the creeper spawn and blown everything
“I don’t want the snowy mountains next to the scorching desert”   me: stares at breath of the wild
I want to play i this world 🤩🤩🤩
this is so cool!! reminds me a lot of greed island!
You should team up with wadzee
Beautiful
The windmill was 👍
Lol.
you know what I love about this channel? It's the fact that all of these hours of work were made into a 15 minute long video with no built in ad or sponsorship, and that if he wanted to he could stretch this video into an hour long but chose not to
That is a lot of work.... Trixy has a lot of creativity and talent...  By the way can you make a Beacontown from Minecraft Story Mode??  Minecraft does not have pylons like in terraria..... The size of the map makes me want some pylons in minecraft...
I would like you to add in the Mountains an chalet where pepole can stay in
Where is the download
Wish I could find some console players that do things like this in survival with no world edit or texture packs. Any suggestions?
You should remake hypixels Skyblock world
Where can i download this?
My PC would cry just by loading this massive world(Lol) Waiting for the finished product.
someone needs to make a mod for this for like bee keeper villager ect.
This man doesn’t get paid enough for this
You did very well broo... 🙌 I played Zelda breath of the wild... I wanna play this map ASAP 😍👏🙌
I wish this is the actual Minecraft.
if minecraft was originally like this I would play minecraft again I played minecraft long time ago and it got boring
This is so cool, I subbed
you should add some underwater areas kinda like Atlantis or something
I can't wait to see the finished product! I would love to play it with a custom BOTW-like mod made specifically for the map!
How do you download the world?
Were can i download the map?
The circle island name: alan mosca
Looks awesome. Would be cool to see some super cool enchanted weapons in like huge temples for example that would relate to the story some how. I am talking about like "God mode" enchantments!
Include a pillow, different types give different effects when slept in :3  P.S: normal pillow doesn’t get a debuff, but different types do in different biomes cause why not
This actually looks amazinng
We will watch your career with great interest... subscribed
This is a beautiful project already and I'm looking forward to seeing where it goes.  Is this Survival map going to include a fortified town/village?
I have an idea the players started with a crashing plane
Once you finish the world could you convert it to bedrock for players that can't play on java?
Why he look like that one guy that says jokes on tiktok😅😅
Where can we download that map
I don't know where. I don't know why. I don't know how. But I feel this needs a volcano.
Make the mooshroom island bigger and make the end and nether cool.
Will this be available for bedrock when it is available to download?  Edit: also could we get a download for the terrain?
Trick be like it is so small  We be like omg it is so big
Which editor app do you use??
Bc of this ima sub to you
314K likes already. People, we’ll be getting that download soon (fuck it’ll be a huge download).
This is like an anime isekaid world, so awesome
Really looking forward to the next vid!! Just saw you as recommended just today and now I'm subscribed hehe
Can you do one in the mobile version? Really love the content<3
Well, 313k Likes after 3 days ,  If you don't know 313k is bigger than 80k, ( 313k > 80k ) get it ? 😁  Where the hell is world Link ????? 🤨
That was the best and most creative u build!!! I appreciate your hardwork, Trixy!
Can I download it? If yes then from where can I download it?
You could make this map into a server and as one idea have a couple traveling cleric carts around the map selling magical potions for lots of currency of choice I think it would be cool
Will this map available to play 😣😣😣?
Cant wait for the download link ^^
this map reminds me a lot of the arena in the second hunger games movie. great job!
Hers an idea from me (I hope u like it). Can u make an across the whole map adventure for like to find an sacred air loom that shouldn't be touched a d you are automatically in trouble and there's only one way out of it. You add another an across the map adventure that gives you the cure. You back to the sacred air loom and put something there too breaking the curse. I really hope you like this and I know its a hassel doing this and i completely understand, plz still consider this.
Can you place a pagoda on top of a high mountain?
underground frozen dinosaurs in the snowy biome
Eyyy I can use this map in 1.12.2???
I cant wait this to be released
Ultimate work, very nice. respect for you, sir <3
How can I download this map?
Very very very..... nice.....
Holy shit I can’t wait for the snowy mountains
Can i play in this map ? I would really love to play in this server
Add a crashed space ship an aliens an you n3ed to do a quest to help fix their ship
"So I did some off-camera building"
imagine getting in contact with a developer and making a world generator with this 😍
Yo,this is insane!I wish Minecraft change it into this
I wish I could build like that
Terraria in a nutshell:
You should make an Ice temple intigrated into an Ice cave
You should do the same to the nether and maybe the end?
Every one of the biomes represents a country
Him building these masive things and im just trying to figutr out how he drew the map
Cant wait mansion and neather fortress upgrade :)
Clash of clans builders watching this video:  👁👄👁
This looks sick!
Imagine these was added to original minecraft
Wow this is Amazing You can even tell at the start of the build Therefore ill sub you
Wandering villager out post!
In the roofed forest make a build based off of the Pokemon mansion from the  kanto region games. I think it would be more burnt and destroyed but hold a big secret to the world. hopefully you see this i think it would be awesome for this build. (that's not the woodland mansion, it would be different)
add rtx in it, then will look beautiful.
Can you please have a download for bedrock🥺
Put a ddungeuons in under ground where  u can get op items            In water...
This was BEAUTIFUL!!! I can’t wait to see it done. Do you play survival Minecraft? If so, would you be interested in playing on a server like Hermitcraft?
Do more!
This looks like adventure time Ooo
This is amazing dude cant wait to see the end. You are so talented man
your videos are so captivating that i got an ad in the middle and completely forgot that i was in YT😂😂 your contrnt is heckin awesome and i LOVE all of your builds 🤩✨
Holy cow 🐄  You sure are a good builder, way better than me, so I’m definitely gonna subscribe!
Is he going to be covering the other biomes in other videos?
Hope this has map download link
Broooo, with the rich history in each biome, the treasure hunts(missions) and the villager's diaries this can easily become a full on survival rpg. It made me think of Skyrim. Great Work and congratulations for it. Im hoping to see more of it !
I wish after he finished this he would let us download the world
Can you maybe add castles into it like a different type of castle in each biome
Woo very interesting speech
I’d like to see the Jungle Tribes have a temple for like, Mother Nature or something
You should make this a mod pack
THIS IS AMAZING!!!
how can i play in your custom survival world
Bruv this man is still underrated. Only 1 mil?! This guy deserves at least 10 million subs for what kind of content he is creating!
you are cool
awesome
How do u download it?
My guy u are a mad man
5:53
How about adding some fossils of giant monsters? I think that would be pretty cool.
What about the butcher
where is the download link?
DAM
Optional story and quests could be cool
Wish that was my world
The world will for java or bedrock....cuz I m a strict bedrock player
No swamp Biome?
A nice builder I have a wish that I would build like him
I think the bee farmer was an amazing idea, as the minecraft community has been pushing for this, seeing as honey doesn't have much use other than in redstone!
Is there gonna be a rp
This amount of like is well deserved congrats 👊 can't wait to see the next improvements 🙏😍
No one: Me: that island on the thumbnail looks like a *croissant*
i saw this on reddit
I've found God. I am no longer an atheist /j
i think you should add another biome which is a mountain with a castle
This is amazing! But the only thing I sort of didn’t like was the windmill. I think the wool should have been connected to the poles instead of the poles being wool
Amongus
Wow
This would be an awesome fantasy adventure map
amazing map!! how can I download it?
Idk why but when I saw the thumbnail I thought of Starlight wonderland ( MS season 5 )
not related to video but i just realized that you don't have eyelashes on your right eye. what's up with that?
‘Asks for 80K likes’ gets 300k+
I don't know why, but I feel like this would be the place where the half-life series would exist.
Wow its so cool
The ruined portal felt like the portal from god of war of jountheim
I love this idea!! Ive seen so many of you builds and never knew it was u! Definitely subbing immediately. One question with the sand. Why does the sand look so white almost like snow? I have it on my world as well and cant figure out how to fix it
Dude this is awesome, you got a sup out of me! Can't wait to see what you have in store next!
Where's the part 2?? I'm really waiting and thank you for the inspirational build❤️
i want giant turtle?
Sheesh man
This would be a good ARK map
The best build Ive ever seen
A secret russian bunker
I saw this on Reddit a few days ago!! I’m so glad I found this here now :)
Mojang should actually hire you!
you should also be able to do building in wynncraft
Please also make it a bedrock edition mcpack
I got so excited then I saw that the writing is prob only going to be in English, I hope he gets someone that can translate all the text to Spanish 🥺💖
i wanna download the world
If this becomes an available minecraft map will there be a mobile version or just pc?
This map should be added as a seed cuz it's beautiful and gives me inspiration but i don't have enough time to try doing kind like these myself
this is gonna feel like an adventure survival map.. awesome!
Please part 2
Villagers in that village "We live now in luxury"
They should hire you now
brush your teeth
Im going to make mmo game in roblox thx
CAN YOU DO ATTACK ON TITAN PLSS
Imagine the size of that world if you download it.
i feel like getting this map on my potato pc would be an insult to the map
add some fossils under ground
This looks like the Wano Kuni from One Piece!!
Magnificent!
Add llamas at the desert so thats they look like camel
Does that mean there is only one village per biome, it’s not bad because that actually adds to the adventure vibe
Could you make it able to be played on bedrock
Minecraft should hire u
I feel lazy
I love thi fovever
Mine
Superb Yaarr
I think mojang should hire you
Add a Kyrate Dragon (Star wars a new hope tatooine skeleton) in the desert please.
could you try to make a secret missile bunker that opens up kinda like the one in nuke town on cod but a lot bigger
Do the villagers actually live in those houses as their role
Uh, 80k likes reached. (310k at the time I am commenting).
You should totally add Herobrine’s mansion somewhere underground 🤫
I thought it's Wano-kuni map. *One Piece
Imagine speedrunning this world/lseed
Do that but in the nether
I wish I can downlaod your worlds for free:)
True content
Add a dungeon
How to download this world for java edition
Just subscribed, love your build, just a suggestion, nake a different playlist for this project, it wilo b easy to find for future
Hope to have it on different platforms. PC, Xbox, Ps consoles, PE, etc. This is so sick sheesh!
If I had minecraft, I would definately download this world, once it was done. However, sadly my parents aren't the biggest fans of minecraft, and so i'll have to wait until I'm 18, and have moved out to do so.
This is amazing and I can’t wait to play!
Bruh I would just take over the pillaged base and use it as my own and also make the huge portal my own 2, AMAZIN
Why couldn't Minecraft do this it's soooo amazing!!!!!
For the mushroom island there should be a Mega Mushroom that is connected to the rest of the mushrooms.
This guy needs to go too 2mil subs because he works hard by making vids
i love how everything looks so tiny on the map and then you realize it's actually massive
This map would make a good role play server
So i did some building off camera.
Why do some people dislike this video? This is awesome
where do i download this
Dude this is amazing.
Add them in minecraft
2:43 is that cactus... in a snowy world
labyrinth inside the sand temple and A BIG ONE AT THAT
Yes more than 80k i think you must give us the map trixy when its finished
Oh my god! This is AMAZING!
Pangea
This is actually the fricking COOLEST MAP IVE EVER SEEN.
WHEN IS PART 2 COMING  YOU GOT 300K+ LIKES
We want this map 😅🤗🙏👍
In one of the villages you should put a map room of the entire world
Dang! If this was an smp I would totally join end add the most shading pack like dang
:)
Oh, ruined portals are vanilla?  I thought they were being added in my one of the mods I use.
I can't even make a box house correctly most of the time
Bro, mojang better hire you
Oh boy now you inspired me to make maps again and also play minecraft.
you should make the back to the future train and as the train like the one the doc turned into his home with his wife that could fly
Hey trixy, add some changes also in netherworld where players can found some mysteries also. If it's possible
This kind da just looks like a hunger games arena, the last one I think
To be honest i always hated those survival players like dream, but when i was a kid i lived for creative mode and i’m so happy people are still using it
U should do this for the nether too
0:58 kinda looks like Pac-Man eating one of those pebble things
Looking kinda sus......
I want the map :(
Plases give me map link
seed?
Do nether plssss
Link to the world ?
I love this imagine if good community made structures and other builds were in the base game
what a master pese
MAN I wish I could get this on bedrock edition. This map would look sooo cool to play on
Mans can literally recreate the whole Dream SMP all by himself.
Do this again but in the nether
Idk why, but i remember genshin impact map xD
Actually have u tried recreating the end and the nether or have u tried one of them I mean it would be AMAZING IF YOU DID
is it possible to download this world?
I think it would be awesome if someone coded minecraft words to replace vanilla things with these but it could still make it load in like a normal map
I wish he could put it on marketplace for free because I play switch and I can’t get it via, download...
How long does it take to build on this scale
Maybe Make a volcano with a fortress
Pls come out with next part soon😚
make this a server
Download plis
You’re doing the caves too?
How about making another biome but this time it’s a city like a BIG CITY oh u could choose how to design btw
Make a submarine next to the mushroom biome and make a military camp at the snow biome and add a helicopter too cuz I love military stuff
Begging of this video is sounding like young Ford and his vision of westword and others
Can you build me a dad?
I want this map!
Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins and rose three days later.  (A sin or sins are acts against the moral law, or, God's law and so serious in God's eyes that it is  punishable by death in the old testament, but since Jesus paid the price we can go to Heaven if we confess with our mouths and believe in our hearts that He is Lord.)
You should make this a mod
Ooooooo I can’t do what you do but I kinda want to try
I have an idea it would be cool to have some wars in it and some nations It would be cool that there will be peacekeepers to protect the world from griefers
Nice work 👍
Fucking genius :)
Minecraft needs to hire this guy 😦
80K likes? HA, child’s play
Hey I have another idea  Try to recreate the entire Pubg Maps on Minecraft ?
It might be a good idea to start at double-size intentionally when terraforming, then downsize to get a more minecrafty flow.
i think this is going to become a map used for every modpack
Is it downloadable
A MEGA MEGA cave
Dang, give up the world link pal
What shaders do you use for the water and sky?
What's the program that u used is it for free?
If Minecraft don't turn its game into what u have builded in the futcher they made the game drunk LOL
Oh my god there's SO many things I could think of that would TOTALLY make this more attention grabbing
If you made mods, they would be amazing
Cleric is like a priest just out a wandering trader in the wagon
Please give it green😭😭😭
Amongus
Map is wayyy over 16 thousand letters lone 16 million It's more like 1,600,000,000 because of the height of it (100m)
Imagine, every seed in minecraft like this
The juvenile week annually beam because chalk cellularly embarrass modulo a abounding river. regular, marvelous circulation
Who else is thinking to download the world and then make it an smp with friends?
The adaptable position conversly pause because letter anteriorly blind failing a greedy novel. petite, profuse ring
Trixy: into there corresponding biome. Proceeds placing a dessert temple in the ice
I just looked and I somehow accidentally disliked so logically I have to like
Ima say one thing this guy makes whole civilization I only make a tree okay I made the tree god that was a lot of work that’s it I am done
Like wow, I wished minecraft actually looked like what you made
Also make a cabin in the taiga and snowy mountains I would love that
imagine an anime bout minecraft but with this map
I cant wait to play this map!!! Holy blow! I havent played singleplayer Minecraft for ages!
I hope Mojang take this guy to work with them and add a new something in minecraft to be a better.Please add a kingdom,villager guard,make a market 😂😅😢
i would love a massive tsunami
Me who cant build a house
Your sir,      *a r e   v e r y    t a l e n t e d*
Please make a illigar world
Perhaps for the mushroom island, you could make there be a ruined civilization of seafaring mushroom people there, with the ruined ship being mushroom themed as well. That would be pretty cool.
Mojang gotta see this
Bild a master Desert pyramid
You got way more likes than you needed!
Mojang needs to hire this man
I think the pillager out post needs to have dark oak wood
The thumbnail looked like a croissant
Can i download or use the map on pocket edition or cellphone?
He said 8000 likes 💀
This man can save mother nature by himself
Part 2 plz
O.M.G. This looks SOOOO  good!
Jesus christ this must be over 16 gb (which btw is the total storage of the phone I'm using rn)
this man went quality over quantity
Cave?
This is soo cool oh my god
i feel like you could add a kind of cave village or something like that on the mountain biome
Bro stop my shit PC can't even run normal Minecraft on the lowest settings at more than 10 fps now you gonna do this damn my shit PC won't even be able to load the map
can you do it as a map for us? so we can download it
Stronghold?

pog
Clean yo teeth breh
I NEED MORE PLSSSS
id pay for this
Cant wait to play the mqp
Pls can i copy the world pls pls
6:52 You Dummy
Do custom mobs to make it more dangerous if not it will be so easy for pro players
wood land mantion ?
Mojang should just have him completely redesign the builds
Fun fact: meat actually isn't as bad for the environment as you think. Methane from cows is a fairly small percentage of greenhouse emissions, and many farm animals including cows eat otherwise wasted food and convert it into protean dense food.
Add a biome were it's like the future
please drop the map i will payyyyyyyyyyy
Can you release the map before all the buildings
Bruh Minecraft got its new update cut out for them
Just a thought: why not, at the end, create a full world with all of the structures in it, replacing the old ones? I reckon it'd be pretty cool...
3rd boss : The Sheriff : He Can Be defeated in the Mesa Biome Will spawn on the train on the railroad. Killing him will give u the : Sheriffs Gun.
Minecraft needs to be more like this...
Man....This is amazing! I hope you keep going! Subscribed immediately!
people the plains boime WAS awsome
If Minecraft vanilla was like this, I'd cry
Mojang gotta hire him for designs
GIVE DA WORLDS
WE HAVE THE LIKES
Floating Island hehehehe
The Knight : Defeating this boss in the "jungle biome" will give u a knights helmet including 7 armor bars and it is unbreakable and it has mending unbreaking 3 and protection 4 : 2nd boss : The King : Defeating this boss in the dark oak biome will give u the "Kings Sword" with fire aspect 5 sharpness 10 with 45 damage : the knights hp 1000 : The kings hp : 10000 : Please do my idea :(
A wizard tower in the dark forest biome
This legit made me cry
I now want to build the world on Minecraft but I know I'm going to give up
Mojang is slacking off compared to this ART!
Minecraft play throughs after off camera mining:
what if you where to add a location in the map with a quest this is a ideaa   werewolf  town  a small town  with a quest witch kills of characters every night you stay it has its own quest in you have to find identified and capture the werewolf and you can either let them live or have a publish execution watch another idea will affect you should add a karma scale witch if you do it will affect gameplay and how easily you can gain trust of characters later on
This is amazing!!! You are such a great builder.  Where does the “river” in the fishing village lead to? Maybe you could add an underground river? Water needs a place to go in order to flow.
I feel like it would be better to prevent mobs from spawning on the roofs in some way
don't forget to leave a like, he so underrated
*ok* *well* *this* *guy’s* *channel* *is* *just* *too* *good* *to* *not* *subscribe...*
I wouldn't be surprised if you got offered a job at mojang after this awesome video.
Make abandoned mineshafts and make it completely dark so we have to explore it ourselves like in the gta secret mineshaft
why don't you put all of this in a realm or a server?
Song: arcade - lakey inspired
Part 2 now
I’ve literally wanted this to be done for years and even dreamed about doing something similar myself. Cant wait to see more!
How long did  it take you to build the entire thing?
Getting a sub for the pure determination
I'm so sorry but I can't figure out what you used for 1:27-1:35 (or something like that i dunno). I heard 'World Paint' I'm just confused is all. I'd love to use something like this for myself and wish to know!!  I apologize again. Great video bud! You earned a sub!!
You got 306k drop dat world boi
Dude you need more support. You are at 1,000,000 subs but you absolutely need more! this is insane! Imagine making something with a big modpack
it’s kinda like botw minecraft edition
This earned you a sub
This will be good for a survival map, but all I'll use it for is using creative mode + immersive engineering and immersive railroading to create trade networks between the villages and inhabited locations.
Please release this map or mod
Omg so cool
sheeeeeeeeesh
you should try to recreate Red Dead Redemption 2’s world in Minecraft!
I wish you can make the kind of map for Minecraft
I think the Badlands should have a large faction of Pillager outpost. Fits the theme
This gave me inspiration :'D
Let's go this is gonna be epic
love 5his vid
You should become an architect
Lol
how do i play this map
Pac-Man biome world
Upgrades people UPGRADES
holy crap... that is so cool
While watching this, I wanted to say this looks absolutely stunning and I can't wait to see more; however, I did come up with a couple ideas: -Swamp Ideas: I think it would be awesome to see the Witch Hut converted into some overgrown apothecary or Coven, having their own dark secrets and rituals, or having the Swamp Villages either hint at working with the Coven or, for something simpler, even just having caged Slimes and reference to them being a food source.  -Nether/End: I know this would be a lot of extra work but I think it would also be cool if the Nether and End could be somehow themed more, maybe showing the Piglin's trying to cure the Warped Forests out of fear for example, or having them worship the Wither. The end could have interesting redesigns, especially with the Cities, such as there being more variants of the Flying Ships or such.  -Other: My other, smaller ideas would be that it would be interesting if some of the Temples had more puzzles and mazes, rewarding those not greedy enough to just go straight for the treasure, or (Desert-only) if they had golden sarcophagi that would release Husks that try to protect its secrets. (if this gets liked or anything, I'll try to add more ideas)
Yo elder scrolls 6 looks sick
Dawload?
When can we download it?
For the desert mosques
Got past 80,000 likes pretty quickly
Alternative title : isekai rpg minecraft
Its amazing to see the progression of each building!
Make a hiden base in the map
When dowjload this straight to the villages
The thumbnail looks like the fortnite season x map
Wow
I can’t even build a house the doesn’t look like trash but this man can build a world
imagine Mojang hired this man for the building of village houses
Mojang should hire guys like this to do a new biome type “amplified structures”. That would be amazing.
man wanted 80k, got 300k in 2 days. ggwellplayed
Underground village😝
Can it be bedrock too pls
Mojang hire him
Me struggling to build a chair after see this: 😮 Me 5 hours later: but it looked so easy
I want this? yesss
I found your underwater kingdom video, maybe you should try building bioshock’s city, it’s uses 1950’s Art Deco art style but sound like a pretty big project so it’s up to you
If i could donate i would pay 100s but im poor you are absolutely deserving of your million subscribers plus 100 million more
Trixy+Jera+Grian+Magmamusen= Epic Build
What’s the seed :O
I hope you get some friends to explore your map together!
Please, hurry up with the publishing... I WANNA PLAY IT NOW!!!!!
This is pog
I'll sub just for this!  This was recommended to me thanks to youtube and it looks insane! I wanna see how the progress goes and be ready to download it when it's ready
I CANT WAIT FOR PART 2!!! It looks absolutely stunning so far!!!! 💗💗
plot twist: Mojang is planning to hire him as their structure designer
i think he forgot the blacksmith in the village
Lots of different cats wolfs and / dogs please!! 🙏🥺
The new fortnite map looking good
bro this man built a whole civilization
How can i get it
This is terrifying and amazing to look at
You should make some cool witch huts with a witch and evoker in it
What I would really like to see is like a world tree somewhat near the center of the map
That shit look like it belong to fortnite 🤨👌🏻
is it me or does he not have eyelashes
This looks like a Catan board
How to get the map?
Make sure to implement passive mob spawns properly
I do hope the mooshroom island gets pushed out into the ocean more, I think it’s a little close to the main island
Cool!
It's like wathcing a movie😮😮😯😯
The stream in the plains village should come from and underground lake
I think he made it to 80,000 likes... lol
Map link plz
This is so goood, building looks like from Mythical sausage
Pls put out a download to that world
Dude this is awesome. I’m super excited to see all the rest of the biomes
U forgot the mansion
Bro... how much time do you have!?!?!?!
This really good!! You should upload the map to curseforge!!!
Can you make the new cage thing then make it even better thank make like a cool looking portal, go through it and meet the hideout off the mobs so kinda like a Minecraft dungeons but enhanced
This is so creative! I want to download it SO bad!
Add a SUSSY amoungis imposter
PLEASE do the nether and end aswell, I wanna see your take on the bastion
If he lets people use it. Will it only be for pc? Or can it be done for Xbox and ps4 or ps5
Bro trixy u could build a indian temple
am proud of you, sir.
I never thought that I would watch this whole video so sincerely.
#idea need to make a mod that adds in all of these custom built things into Minecraft so that it’s spawned as well! Like the trees and buildings!
Hey what is the seed
Is it Java or pocket??lol it looks fun
Wow I want see someone play this world
This is amazing. I have an idea to create Fast Travel Points using Command Blocks (even don't having any idea how to do it). This map would be perfect to an survival game like The Forest, Subnatuica (it'll be cool to have a history and missions sistem, making you walk through the whole map, transforming this world in a truly rpg game)
Can you make it downloadable for Pocket edition?
You should add a military base or some kind of army base like for the village
This was amazing.
Just a suggestion that probably won’t be noticed, but if you’re not too tired at the end of this project, then maybe you could try transforming a small part of the nether where that ruined portal “would” lead with the nether fortress and bastions upgraded along with the obvious tree upgrades and stuff. Maybe even add some houses or huts for the piglins? Just a suggestion, and probably won’t be noticed, but I wanted to put it out there.
Add the create mod for the build to work like the windmill and a water wheel house can be added in the village in plains biome
are there still chests to loot?
Hidden villager cult at bedrock level? =D
I can't wait to see the finished map!
Dang! Can't wait to download this map if you can!
make a warfront featureing a large cotninate as a ww2 wasteland
I was thinking of a cool build like a tree house village in jungle biome,it would be a new idea and look cool and a jungle temple
Is this the biggest project in Minecraft ever🤯
Epic. I just found your channel, but if you haven’t done this yet, I think some building tips from you would be amazing... I wish I could build like you (not even giant builds like you usually do, I just don’t want my houses to be blocks or L-shaped boxes with roofs)
I mean do even have to build your own house if the village is that good?
can you send me the link for download of the world
so where do i download edit: GET IT TO THE GOAL NOW I NEED THIS
We also need modern area
Rick roll qr code under the mushroom island
Like notch in hidden place
We need Easter eggs
Mojang needs to hire this guy
🅐︎ 🅑︎🅐︎🅝︎🅐︎🅝︎🅐︎ 🅟︎🅘︎🅢︎<3
Yo I got a great idea man, In the snow biome put a desert temple and a few hints suggesting it may have been a desert long ago (as a reference to Antarctica being a desert). Also add a sign over each profession house labeling the profession
Survive 100 days in this
Add walls and a castle at the villages like   there were during feudal times and then ad the "kings castle" at the mushroom biome
How can i get the map
Your beyond talented💙💙💙
So uhhhhh, gamer has gf? CANCELLED
In the snow there could be one or even a couple of igloos, with entries of adventurers lost in the snow, maybe even a tunnel system connecting the igloos that are ruined
Plz put loot in villages house
I think adding some kind of school in the villages would be cool to so theirs a place where villager chidden would learn basic things lore wise
That's so awesome I wish I could download that world...when I saw your video I was like nah..then a few secs later..then I was wow heart me new fan/subscriber here☺️☺️I appreciate your works..I'm from Philippines 😍😍
Will there be a viking town?
Could you add this to the mc store so console players can play?
This should be the new hunger games map
Bruh imagine how fun it is to play this custom world it would feel like you're on your own story and your the main protagonist going on adventures.
You should build in the jungle biome an Aztec city or pyramid
i love this on a level where i cant even explain it
Your so cool
2.1 million views in 3 days wow good on you mate keep it up 🙌🏼
you should make a download
Is it just me or this video make me calm
Mojang should hire this man.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE MAKE A BREATH OF THE WILD MAP 🙏🙏🙏
Animal mods
Wow 320k likes he's definitely releasing it
Now I want to play survival one this 😃 It looks amazing!
Definitely should include an overall goal to get to (besides the ender dragon)

Can my pc load this world Specs: 8 GB ram              i3 3rd generation             Intergerted graphic card
Mojang:write that down  write that down
In every Biome you should add a giant Biome monster that is like a boss and after defeating that you should make a boss that uses all Biomes to destroy you 😳😆😆
Wait what about the nether next
Hmmm   thats a lil more than 80k
*"spanning across 16000 blocks"* 2b2t's obsidian structures: *pathetic*
The first time I saw this video I just had to subscribe you're so talented if only Minecraft could be like this 🤦👌
Do a Lost bunker on the island hiden somewhere
Breath or the wild, brings back good memories😞
You should make a sky realm
You are no life but is cool
Brush your teeth man
What about a special underwater structure like maybe a flooded city or sunken ship in the big ocean that’s at the bottom of the map
For the snow land you should add a mod pack with yete
You make something for the wondering villager
Cant wait for pt 2
One thing, MIND BLOWING!
Me building my one story house with no roof Looks at his builds “ well fu- “
glad this was on my recommended
This is such a good idea wow! Keep going please!
You should make something in the snowy area were it references the zombie outbreak in the village, and maybe how the disease started
Your a god
You gotta add some hidden Dino bones
The old ink peroperatively mess up because snowstorm occasionally sail during a verdant battery. deafening, red salary
Can bedrock players play this? Plz can they actually I’ll be rlly sad
Where can I get this map?
Christ, AND I'M HAVING TROUBLE TO JUST DESIGN A SMALLL HOUSE
Why does he look fake? He looks like he's A.I animated
Ok I’m love this style
OR NEAR THE JUNGLE
OR NEAR THE JUNGLE
Feeling an upside down pyramid somewhere underground that used to house an entire civilization
I THINK U SHOULD ADD A VOLCANO NEAR THE VILLAGE
Reminds me of Ooo from adventure time
Imagine if this was a seed and someone got it They would be so confused
Create world tree like those in anime
its ironic, i kinda had the same idea but instead it would be a world with different factions, for example the traditional faries faction in the forest with a giant tree and overgrowth and an underground system, a giant city with walls and a castle in the center and a lot of redstone for the human faction , and underwater city with diamnod pyramids for buffs along with the conduits for the atlantean faction, all in different areas of the world, its still a work in progress and will take a looong time fir me to finish ;-;
Some ideas: Maybe an invader coming from the east to take over the island or another biome in the neather as like a piglen village that is at war with the plains or something like that
Wow. I wouldn’t mind putting money down on this map. This is great man. I can’t wait for the final.
Crystal mines, new animals, small subplots, weapons, avatar like islands in the skies,  temples of old gpds, underground blackmarkets, secret things(worlds, mythical creatures,rooms,libraries,castles etc), atlantic like sea world, ahh maybe upgrade for the ocean?
Yo, world download?
Hey can you add this for console Because I would be happy playing it.
Make it a server
Why not have a locomotive depo with the wild west town, which can have several engines around a turn table
00:09 woooow u might wanna upgrade ur teeth first 😂
Your The Best im a New Sub 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
Realy cant wait for u to do the rest of the biomes and finish its so cool!
i havent watched something with such interest in a long time, i wish to play it and cant wait for the build to be available for download <33
what if u got a few mods to add special creatures to certain places
A castle
mojang should hire you to design all of the structures and stuff you did in this video
Wow!
am i playing minecraft wrong... or not good enough...
The equal athlete differently fit because blouse formerly dress times a erect week. black-and-white, fluttering fork
BOTWWWWWWW YESSS
I am looking forward to your mega project man! 😊
ILOVEIT!
Me: *rebuilding a town*  Him: *rebuilds the world
This is so beautiful 🥲
You should make custom stronghold and custom end dimension, at least a part of it. And also custom nether and ice spikes biome would be great
What app did you use to make the land for minecraft
I wanna play this..
I know you prefer to pay tribute to the original vanilla designs but wouldn't it be cool it there's an outpost for iron golems or something? Cause they do spawn naturally in villages, just that they spawn everywhere it doesn't make sense.
I THINK U SHOULD ADD A VOLCANO
Can you put this on the bedrock market place please so bedrock players can get it
I subscribed for this series, can't wait for more
You it lukes like qatan
You should do a Hunger games thing with this
Please make the world download work for mobile
Send this to Mumbo jumbo...oh will he be happy to build huh and all these-...just you are awsome
Hey Trixy I want to know if we need to be a part of your patreon to get the download. It is really hard to find a good custom minecraft world these days. My little sister is getting hyped but will be really disappointed if I cant download it for her. Keep up the good work and good luck on the rest of the world.
yeah, no. my pc would BLOW!!
I love the concept, it'd be dope to have nice riverways and ponds throughout the land. As long as its not one big ol ocean
This was awesome
And because of this map, I sub to you
Take notes mojang
You should add a Pepsi can     Grab can near you for $0.50
I recommand to give epic quest in the game
it would be a cool idea if you could put a hobbit home in the plains.
Can't wait till this map is out for download
Ur insane🔥
The Desert would be cool if it was a camp as if they travel frequently.
Me before watching: I would say I'm a good builder  Me after watching: I'm the most terrible builder in the world
Oh my, I saw the thumbnail and bought this was Fortnite. And I was like why tf is this on my recommendation😭
Make the weapon smith armor smith brothers and build a combined house and work shop
Imagine if Mojang hired content creators to help redesign the game i feel like some people would build  Mona Lisas and the other people would make a poop block more rare than diamons.
This is impressive
You need more subscribers likes and support
Look at the views...now look at his subs..... what the actual hell
hypixel builders be like:
Letss gooo. Damn. I just found you today
Swamp: **cries**
For an Easter egg you should put an UFO somewhere in the map, maybe in a lake, maybe on a mountain, maybe inside of a mine which leads deep into a dungeon ?
Those shaders finna make me act up...
We got 299k likes. G I v e m e t h e d o w n l o a d

I wish there was a swamp biome
Download links?
Man i am looking forward to play in this world🤩
This is totally Worth a subscribe
BOB ROSS LESS GOOOOOOOOOOO
Could you put this in bedrock so we can play it too?
I hate minecraft.
Imagine if mojang asked you to make the 1.18 update the structure update
THIS IS SICK!!!
you forgot  a raveen
Maybe partner with someone like SystemZee or Tango Tek for some custom additions! Would be epic.
Where’s the download for this map? Or is it not playable yet? @TrixyBlox
We shall not skip any ads and watch for at least 30seconds for content like this 😊
THIS IS AMAZING, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK
Its so gooooooddd
Can this be used for , Pocket edition , to??? Or is it only , Java , or Window 10?
I've seen this somewhere on reddit or Instagram
Mojang need to take some notes
Nerd
6:53
duude you gotta find a way to get this into bedrock, itll be really cool
You should put a swamp (in the form of a mangrove) biome by where the  jungle biome touches the water
Ayo can u rebuild my life
WHat If He Defeat The EnderDragon
He looks like when you put a collage of a bunch of different people together
when the island is SUS 0:01
It physically hurt when he said he took inspiration from the temple of time from breath of the wild. Bro, that ain't from breath of the wild
I would love to build something like this and even larger in beta 1.6.6 but unfortunately my Xbox 360 doesn't even have 1,300 blocks long of a world so that thing is like 3.5 times the amount of the world space that I have this is some heavy inspiration dude I'm almost tempted to terraform an entire world anybody else still playing beta Minecraft or any older version in 2021? If you're curious I can even tell you how to get there on the 360 that is if you have one of course
I can’t wait to see everything finished! This looks so good!
Where that World Download?
Is it possible to download this map on Xbox 1 version of Minecraft when it is available for download
Wow 🥺 my eyes
This looks amazing! I can't wait until it's finished!
I'm glad I clicked on this video and I'm super hyped for the world.
Ay MOJANG where u at hire this man
You should have a secret futuristic underground city underneath the jungle. Idk just an idea
Download?
I hope you make (or make a version of) this world were it's like adventure mode.. This build has so much potential to be a adventure map or something.. Mods and commands would be amazing for this..   Just an idea(not great)   Go to a certain biome for block of obsidian to be placed on the portal.. make it not placeable for players.. like that idk
How can you play this or can you even play it
When I heard “I used some inspiration from the legend of Zelda, breath of the wild” I went    BUILD THAT MAP
New fortnite map looking fire  😯🥶🥵🥶🥵🥶🥵🥶🥵
Map sus
What about nether?
How do we download this world?
hyped to try and play on it!
this is so awesome i strive to get to this scale build sometime
The only word I can say is “Respect”
When you post your map can you make it to where its on java and bedrock
How much time to build that map and decorate????
Is it just me or dose therapy kinda look like a croissant
some indiana jones treasure hunt
I imagine this being the next trend.. similar to Diversity and the series. i hope this is and adventure map of some sorts..
Sorry F doing this againIt’s because do you have gameplay of this it looks awesome I’m a big Minecraft lover I even have Minecraft like I was Minecraft again I’m here from Minecraft dungeons so do gameplay of this now
Petition to make a structure update in new Minecraft version
Make a history of a new dimension like sky dimension or the sea dimension
the next fortnite/warzone map
I would pay 100 for this world i want to play on this so bad
Imagine doing this in survivle with no WORLD edit
Make mods for every new thing and make new mobs please
Building tutorial: it’s really just easy: Output: THIS
you have such beautiful and artistic ideas it gives me inspiration for my own artwork. thank you for contributing to this world in such a creative and wholesome way
What about the end portal and end lands?
I was kinda hoping you'd have a blacksmith, too
Good idea. Too basic of a map
Will there be a end portal or a mineshaft? Also will there be a ice place? BTW love your builds!
In the Wild West I would love to see a back to the future part 3 reference
I'd love a role play in this world
I'll love see the notch's face in the jungle, that may be funny
A shrine hidden in the mountain's to some deity?
Looks like a fortnite map
WHERE ARE THE GOLEMS?!
Where do I get the download?
Can you add more animals like tigers, giraffes, elephants, ect.
Just also remember that you have to upgrade the neather in this world too
Uhm, you've already got 80,000 likes. So where's the part 2...    Jk......
you should add a piret ship
how about the end portal?
Trixy: "I've just added minor upgrades" Mojang: "take note boys" Trixy: *makes the most epic transformation* Mojang/everyone: *surprised Pikachu face*
Imagine a pvp in this
"I did a little building off camera"
Is it gonna be on Java and bedrock or no
My inpatients: NAW
I can see the taiga biome having a Inuit village where the main profession is hunting, fishing and ice making...
How do you get this on switch? Because I’m switch player’
I need at least one abandoned castel plz
You can create a modern city walled off from the rest of the map maybe. IDK I’m not very imaginative when it comes to these kinds of builds
u should put the mountain kingdom from the hobbit
Desert: Pyramids with booby traps and a tomb with gold and husk spawners. Crowded middle eastern style village with markets and a palace(kind of like Alladin).
BRUUUH I EVEN NOT PLAY IN SURVIVAL WORD WHAT THE EVEN WORSE IS WHEN I GET A FULL DIAMOND ARMORY I GET IT WHIS CREATIVE I CANT WAIT FOR PART 2
Sometimes i really wish i had pc minecraft so i could download these maps, but im only on ps4 and it sucks that i gotta miss out 😔
the island actually locks a bit like Voya Nui from the Bionicle franchise, sick build btw :)
Wow Microsoft needs to add some of your structures into vanilla, those trees are a massive improvement
So is he going to continue this a when 🤔
Vanilla Minecraft turns every block with vanilla
Will this map be available to download on bedrock
I got to ask but is that build underground the Mines of Moria from lotr
GET ON HERMITCRAFT YOU ARE JUST AS GOOD AS GRIAN... probably better honestly
You should also add just a little bit more hilly hills. Like the scenery is beautiful, don't get me wrong, but more bumpy hills maybe here and there would make it more realistic. Also something like the "Nether trials" would be cool too!
a volcano sounds cool
You are so creative! LOVE IT
Me trying to do something like this with no tools not even a costum world: Ok this will probably take 10 years but that’s ok 👍🏻  Him: This will probably take 1 year but that’s fine  Me: I guess it will take longer...
This is going to be awesome I can't wait
You should let the community decide the design of some of the biomes! Like you give a world download and we decorate and change up a biome or two and send it to you and you choose the best idea to use!
*KAWAY KAWAY SA MGA PINOY JAN* 🇵🇭
I am speechless,  this map is a freaking masterpiece 🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐😲😲😲😲
13:28 this music is really out of place, and blasting into ears, rather than fitting with medieval village
I 1 time found a broken portal in vanilla and it was almost the same size as that 1. Plzzzz some 1 explain cuz im off track
sus
I just can’t wait to see temples
@Minecraft come here take some inspiration
80k likes? How about we do it 4 times that? ;)
Man I have literally always wanted a seed that had every biome in the game surrounding a plains. Along with every type of village and structure in each of those biomes.. wish there was a real seed like this...
*Mojang taking notes frantically*
will there eventually be a download for the map (I get he's still probably building it so I'm not asking where, I'm just asking if it will be a thing)
HOLY S THIS LOOKS SO COOL
Honestly, I can't frigging wait to play on this map if it comes out
This probably won't happen but a second continent or a custom nether would be cool
Having the Matterhorn in the snowy biome would be dope
Bro can i download it
All these squares make a circle. Teamfourstar
MOOCE
So 100% this also needs to be a seed a data pack for some type of World mod because it would be cool to have this with some modded stuff I saw that Windmill and instantly thought of create even just being vanilla this is pretty amazing
Wait when is the next update to this world coming out
Zelda fans when he made a windmill hut: A v ^
don't work alone! you are going to get burned out
Tell us when you will release the map!
I wish this would come to Xbox I’d cry
you asked 80k likes, we give you more !
An ice fortress

The groovy dorothy initially exist because respect renomegaly drop following a testy hubcap. valuable, synonymous lathe
I hope it has MOBILE version haahaa
Will you be able to get it on consoles
Build a midieval city some where
Is there gonna be a pt.2 to this?
I usually find these videos kind of boring but when I started watching for some reason I just didn’t stop. Great vid
Can we all take a moment to subscribe and like for how long he spent for this.
Yooooo! I Wish I Came Across Your Channel Sooner, But At least I Caught This! I Actually Have Some Ideas, Some Of Which Are Easy To Implement, Some Not. But, To Explain What I Want The Most, Im Gonna Have To Explain What I Like A lot In Games, BACKTRACKING! Okay, Hear Me Out, If Done Right, It Can Actually Be Enjoyable. It’s Hard, But Possible, My Favorite Example Of This Is The Ultibed From M&L:DT (totallynotbiased) In The Game, You Go Back Through Each Area You’ve Been To Before, And Unlock New Abilities In Each Area, And Also Exploring New Parts Of Said Area. I Think If The Map Had Something Similar And If Done Right, It Could Help The Map. Like, Have A Roadblock That Says: “HEY IDIOT! THERE IS MORE TO EXPLORE!” And Then Guide Them To Each Area, And Have Them Use What They Have At That Point, (let’s say they just reached Diamond) And Let’s Say, There Was A Wall Of Obsidian Blocking Off A Huge Temple Within The Jungle. That Would Give A Reason For Them To Go Back, And Explore! (Other Ideas: Try Custom Builds That Feel Like That Would Fit In Vanilla. Using The Progression System Of Minecraft To Lock Areas, Just Incase You Don’t Think A Player Will Be Prepared Enough. Using Strong Mobs As Bosses When You Shouldn’t Be Facing Them. (i.e. ravager at leather)) Again, I Really Wish I Came Across Your Channel Sooner, This Video Was Very High Quality, And The Editing Was Fantastic. Real Nice Job, Consider Yourself Subscribed!
Make it for bedrock edition to please:)
How did you record Minecraft like that with it not looking at skin
Why doesn’t Mojang hire this guy?
I like it to download the map
stonehenge. Stonehenge. STONEHENGE
Lichrally. God I like British accents.
Omg I just heard that in the video Excuse me how do you miscalculate something like that but hey it's better for us players a bigger world for us 👏🏻
Add a lost civilisation in the jungle and maybe a frozen camp in the mountains
So much breath of the wild vibes
That world lookin kinda sus
Omg the way I am so excited for this I have been looking for something like this since I started playing Minecraft!
He is literally getting a free sub :D
I would have loved the map before all the upgrades lol
You need to spend less time on minecraft and more time on your teeth homie
THIS IS SO COOL!
ive been looking for a world like this for a rpg modded world thanks man
for 1.18 they should revamp all of the minecraft structures to match the new world size/ height
You should play around with this a bit and put in mods so there would be more mobs and way more life
Find out at the end the hole worls has a underground base where people of higher intelligent are watching over the island
Where I can download this map?
7:31 this gave me an idea for a base 🤩🤩🤩
Wampa cave lmao
*Jeracraft VS TrixyBlox*
Put a hidden star destroyer in the ocean
Hey you sould make a big hotel
Love this concept
Sky Island please love the great work
Bet some 7 years olds will download this and tell his friends he built it.
We need this can u realease this and give the name to use pls? Ur work is AMAZING btw
NO WAY, THAT'S TOO COOL
In the forest siren head
“I wanted to stay true to the original design and added only minor changes”
*Me : build a custom village for the villager* The villager : you destroyed our home that we build with our hand, and you simply thought we would live here?
When it time to get the family and to help you build. I could never. Love the videos.
anyone else getting *ARK: Survival Evolved* vibes from the story?
nice. it would be cool to see this as a mod
Have to ask though... is there actually ores and stuff in the ground or is it just going to be borderline to absolutely impossible to get diamonds on this map?  Forgive if I'm being a dumb but it's a genuine thought
I low key NEED this map 😍
Dude this is AWSOME
0:10 trixy looks like a knock off brand of David dobrik
Trixy needs to be employed already
Next video: I just built the world on a 1:1 scale, yep, thats right, every city, country, island, you name it, in Minecraft
Can you do a tutorial for the village
yoooooo thats past 80k likes
Something cool to see in this world would be the remains of ancient beasts. In the snowy mountains, for example, there could be the remains of a giant wooly mammoth preserved in the ice caves below. The jungle could have the remains of a giant lizard whose mysterious properties cause the vegetation to be more lush and vibrant. Maybe the tribes are fighting over its power? The one that I would hope for the most is the remains of a giant vulture in the mesa that the wild west town is built upon.
This should be a generation mod
How          Long...
I'm a leave and also seeing your amazing skill I think it would be cool if you could make attack on Titan map
Custom bosses and enemies in each biome pls
This is beautiful
Can you add a giant ice cave filled with treasure
I wish I was this good at building :( I get my inspiration from you tricky.
so what about the woodland mansion???
He was the kid who was always better than his friends at building in Minecraft
Mojang needs to pay you to implement this into there game
This dude should woek at minecraft
A wood mansion
If you want to add a quest so you can have mor story line you can do / give @s spawn_eggs 1 51fore villager that can customize to give items and diologand
Make a poop house
Trixy, will you be releasing this on the bedrock store. I’m sure a lot of people would buy it, including me. As it is honestly a really cool and unique world! Oh and are you planning anything for the nether. I would honestly love an edited nether!
This is sick, I’m excited to see the Wild West of the Mesa biome. I hope it has Red Dead Redemption vibes.
Maybe you could add a mini shrine dedicated to thanking iron golems for their protection in all the villages? I just feel like there should be something made about iron golems in general Perhaps you could even create a large iron golem production facility somewhere on the map, likely hidden underground, which would provide your map with lore about where the iron golems are coming from Edit: Perhaps instead of being completely hidden underground, it could be poking out of wall inside of a massive revien
I won’t sub unless u tell us the secrets
Damn fortnite season 7 leaks already
I cannot wait to move into that beekeeper house. Bees are the best animal to farm in Minecraft.
First time watching you and already got me hooked! Can’t wait to watch more! This is crazy awesome
wher mep
How do you even get a like and dislike ratio like that is an achievement
I think there shode be a area in the mesa with broken rv's on top of each other and zipplines you can bild.
i really wish real minecraft had these types of stuff
u r god
At this point you may as well make this a RPG server, this map would have to much quests and bos
You gotta do the nether too!!!
You should try and include the ice and fire mod so there is more content
This is one of the best (in my opinion) minecraft videos I’ve ever seen. Absolutely amazing, I just wish it lasted longer.
This Is Just, Awesome!
You should make a tree like the avatar movie
Bethesda games be like:
I’ve been looking for good building inspirations and this was PERFECT thx so much
This guy doesn’t have OCD
Where can I download this I because would love to do a 100-200 day survival series on this map?
This is straight up stunning
I wish this was a mod
minecraft story mode should have been a giant minecraft map like this, not a new game
nice
Sounds like he’s making a map like red dead redemption 2. Full of secrets and backstory
I need this map
Just wanted to make sure you didn’t forget to put a little bamboo in the jungle.
Wow, your as good as smallishbeans! Also this is a rlly good idea. Just wanted to say dat OwO
wtf I stopped watching YouTube and you had 100k subs and I come back and you have 1m?? holy shit man
This is gonna be very fun.
You should definitely include a Theives and/or Adventurers Guild
Can you make a pocket edition map like this one please?
the map will be available for download? I like it very much
MAD FRICKIN' LAD xD
No way for me to get on Xbox huh
Dude's teeth are nasty af. It's called a toothbrush man
You should make a huge ravine in the savana that has a small village inside
Damn you're the best a this But a 16 million blocks to build must take u a very long time So try to copy building in the villages (I know u did but the houses in the village are builted again more than 3 times) Have a good day. Edit:(please copy the pyramid in that video)
Noice
Hay I got something, you can make an abandoned castle inside a mountain at the snow biome
You really should include a data pack with the final release, so that trees that grow from Saplings, grow into your custom trees, and keeps things respawning in their respective areas. Make us spawn in a random village each time, so that it feels even more immersive, as if we were just a villager. You could get a really neat and well oiled RPG outta this, maybe even have quests be sold by the NPC's that you've built houses for
Add a delorean in the mine of the western town or a some other hint to back to the future
I love breath of the wild :D amazing to see this map
Full metal alchemist
Is there a download?
I would like to imagine that the pillagers wouldve built a bridge over to the mushroom island
You should add a end portal so you can actually beat the game
I'm getting a skyrim vibe from this project
can you make this a download
Make a big bout pliss in there
So awesome, wish I has the patience to make something like that in Minecraft!
This is so amazing, I love watching your content and will always get a like from me
Will there be ores in the ground
This reminds of adventure time when Ooo was split into all of those elements
You should add like a whole city school and work place in the plains for people who like to role play lol
use a  ƈǟʟƈʊʟǟȶօʀ
How can u play it
this looks like the map of an open world story game that would have a fufilling ending that makes me want to play it over and over again.
I wanna see the rest of themmmm!!
When villagers evolve 13:29
sorry but 4000 x 4000 is not 16000, 4000 x 4 is lmao
Can't wait to play this map as a survival map with my friends
is the next video out
This would be a sick pvp map
This is awesome can't wait to play but will there be a stronghold, end and nether?
Is this for Xbox as well??
is it gonna be free??????
why did that intro give me massive read dead redemption 2 vibes
BRUH i'm in LOVE with this world
whoever disliked video this is just jealous
Where do I get this map ?
Bro you are freaking amazing idk how you do it
To make gold mining more adventures you should make a mind rail like a roller coaster going in different directions looking like a Labrinth of mine trains
I can't build s h I t   I don't even know how to do layout of the city   Any tips mate :o
did anyone else see that the flag on the pilliager outpost was going against the wind?
Mate I would love to download
a realy good job that fits the realy good idea. i hope you are going to show us the progres
Bruh my computer would blow up if I tried running this
Q perfeito cara I from Brazil and I loved
If was mojand doing this It would take like 10 years.
this world looks kinda sus my guy
Will this be playable for all version of minecraft??
I am so excited to download this! If you let us of course!
Trixy: 80,000 likes for part 2  — 2 days later —  200,000 likes   Me: HOW
Put a chicken wing in the mine
9:20 crop farms are worse for the environment tho
I'm so in
Me: *builds dirt house and feeling good  Pro builders:* build whole map and call it decent
i would literally give up at the point where i needed to add trees
My mouth was wide open the whole building process 🤯🤯😯😯
what shaders do you use?
This is amazing why you dont have 100 milion subs
Can there be a sky island?
This world is perfect
You should hire people to do commands and make this a server, it would be a easy way to make money and it would be extremely popular.
The fact this is among us shaped is driving me insane
download???
What i think would be incredible is a minecraft map that has a similar size, story, and playability as a Bethesda game like the elder scrolls or fallout. that would be a huge project but I would buy that map in a heartbeat
Where is the world dowload?>:(
TrixyBlox in 2024  Ok so let’s re design these villagers here!
Maybe include (as an idea for a secret story thing) A mine combined with some dungeons with nether or end secrets that may lead to or tails or a darker, smaller story line.
When will it develop Minecraft, according to what you say
just a small suggestion, I would suggest adding a bit of rock around the sides of the staircase to the portal to make it look more like they built into the rock a bit
THIS IS AWESOME
That would be the Best buildings if Tektopia was suited for 1.16
i love how you just have an idea for everything and how good you are at it i wish i had the same skill
Imagine adding a underground alien lab randomly lol
just dont forget to upgrade nether and the end also the end ofc, in the end of how long you want the nether to be you can make a giant lava sea and some lav botes with loot, also make some walls to the willage, since this is like a hub meybe this can be a city. and aso please upgrade the end cityes the has always disappointrd me. good luch with this and keep going (also hope you going to 1,5m soon, and btw sorry for my bad english)
Request: Temple of Doom-style minecart ride inside a jungle temple.
this is on my birth day lol
yo this is crazy this could be a huge thing
Holy s**t you earn a sub. And also when you do the Mesa biome it’d be cool if you build a dam holding back a small lake, It could be a little construction site.
WoW
I Feel like the villager village is missing a house with a entry to a mine, and some animal farm/stable or something for cows etc.   Otherwise it looks amazing
i honestly cant wait to see the wild west part
yo that logo is sick any merch in the works?
Wow! For the plains I would swap that tree in the middle and size it up and then it would be a Grand Elder Tree ( not too huge ) Luv the videos keep it up!
This be pretty cool, though I wonder if this is gonna be purely vanilla or if it will have modded content, like villager guards and new types of pillagers
Soooo, where do I download this?
Unshould add new mobs like yetis and stuff and mobs for the story like stoey mobs
🤫
Probably one of the fastest times I’ve subbed for anyone I’ve just met o-o
Saw the island on reddit! Looks awesome dude!
dont forget to add an end portal
Yo you forgot to do that actual nether biome
Am I the only one how doesn‘t know were he is building the nother bioms????????????
When your bored:
Oh good it’s the voxel sniper guy
Question, is there any way your able to get this on bedrock?
Who else saw the dummies you dummy
WOW  WOOOOOOOW
This is amazing bro you deserve more subs like what
There should be multiple broken records
Minecraft, start taking notes
wow-
Mojang, please hire this man to redo the auto generated structures in Minecraft XD Please XD
My head when I look on the second part of the thumbnail: *AMOGUS*
If minecraft actually looked like this, it would undebatably be the best game ever made
Clever
Pls complete this! Its so cool!
New title, "MAKING FORTNITE IN MINECRAFT"
Wait I’m confused is he gonna make another? Because he only did the plains biome
More plz
fact: this world is actually bigger than the Vatican city. According to Minecraft every block is one cubic meter and this map has a size of 16 Million blocks which would be around 16 Million square meters whilst the Vatican City is 4.7 million square meters. This is based on real information. Quite interesting right?
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
the thumbnail of the video looks like among us
I love watching videos of your builds.  Relaxing and inspirational at the same time
Wowie this is BIGGEST I never seen.
Minecraft seed pls, and can you speed run this world?
You could make the Desert temple a Dungeon
Wow... this is AWESOME!
Wow
maybe you should comission someone to make it into an adventure map cause if i played on that map on survival my heart just wouldnt let me break even a single tree.
Will It be free to download?
Hop to have the map ?
just give the next part of the project! cant wait to see the whole thing of this map !! :>
part2 plz
In winter village you can build a moscow kreml castle style buildings
THE MAPPPPPPPPPPP
I think I'm gonna try to transform it even further once it's out, adding little things like mob camps with spawners in them, and chests with loot that take skill to reach, inspired by Breath of the Wild.
That one kid for a school project:
I would recommend building ancient ruins around the portal inspired by the Greek architecture
Good job mate 😂
also you should include like a realm in the sky or something
Will the island have cave generation?
secret idea : king arthur  \ or the master (link's) sword on a shrine underground
Love this!🤩
as soon as my man said 80 thousand likes i liked it even if there were already 226thousand
This is so cool but i cant build such a great thing im not that creativ and im bad at building Q.Q
16,000,000 MILLON BLOCKS DUDE YOU REALLY MISCALCULATED!!!!!!!!!
is this java, and if it is could you maybe make some cool maps like this for bedrock? that would be awesome!
So if you grow trees with normal tree seeds, could you make a command that your tree designs grow instead of the normal ones, i guess this would be kinda more beautiful. Btw: GREAT IDEA, PLEASE CONTINUE
You should add ur mom
Only 80,000 likes? this is for 1,000,000 likes
an SMP of this would be so sick!!
WOW
Now that's good content right there
You really just done went and made a whole DnD world-
omg this is so cool
STRAIGHT UP INCREDIBLE
Looks absolutely amazing 😍
Pewds really have to see this
Please make this also for bedrockkkk!
Maybe a massive (like maybe a full-biome length) dragon skeleton in one of the biomes? That’d be cool
Who would win? A pillager outpost, which took hours to built. Or flint and steal?
When the island is sus
where download
This gives me GOT vibes. I never watched GOT
I always wished to someone to do this! :D
PART 2 PLEASEEEE
About about a forgotten survival bunker from one of the zombie outbreak deep underground? Amazing work btw
So this is just an idea but you should add a massive underworld under the map like  purgatory.
we need this to be playable.
Where/when can I dowload it for a Survival?
You should do a underground lair full of nasty mobs and then at the back lots of good tresure
W E E D E A T E R
Transform a woodland mansion
you should put zombies in the abandon wild west village
Hey, you should make each village have certain colours, like, yellow and white, green and white, red and white, and such. It would give a spice for the variety and navigation.
BoTW and Minecraft are my Favourite Games!! I am really happy that you are playing it (BoTW)
Are you going to transform the nether too?
No blacksmith?
Put a castle in there somewhere
Aight this looks good
I’m excited for this
the map looks like a among us character
This is really good
sooooo cool
Looks dope cannot wait, u should do a giant monsters bones underground somewhere and it branches through a cave system randomly
For the desert, add ruined wagons around the place
DUDE THE BEE FARM THO... SICKKKK TrixyBlox needs to get more recognition, he's such a good builder!!!!!! Also the Beekeeper should really be a villager profession. Mojang should've added it in 1.15.
This is so cool!!!
Trixy this vid has 1.9 M views
Why not make a Bermuda Triangle thing were there is a bunch of shipwrecks and Plane wrecks? idk thought it would be cool
I wish this was on bedrock :(
Make a profession for the snow villagers exclusively called “the ice fisher”
Hey, great idea and super nice buildings so far, maybe a graveyard at the back of the church will make it a little more realistic
Omg can't wait to play this myself, this is so amazing ❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥
For the dark oak forest you should make a big fantasy-like tree, it doesn’t have to reach the build limit or anything like that, just have it stand out and have some sort of affect on that biome
When do you think the map will be released
Amazing
Where is the download link I’ll make a mod that has a bee keeper I make mods for people and my self I want to help you but can you tell people to subscribe to me please I’m a big fan you made me think of making the bee keeper mod pack
Trixy makes some of the coolest most detailed builds it’s so cool what he can do keep up the good work!
Dog sled race track along the tundra and into the mountains/their village(s) would be super fun.
Yo hit 80,000 likes so quick Yk what to do
Idea: add more chests in one structure bc this world doesn't have a lot of structures like a normal world so its makes this map much more fun to play in it
Pls tell me this is a seed we can use. This maps dope
Build a scp facility plz
Please make a berserk map.
Mojang should really hire some of these pro builders to redo the old minecraft structures. This looks 100X better than vanilla.
world download link?
I actually saw this the other day on Reddit and wanted to see where it was going
This is so sick! You are an Elite Builder!
Can you make this to an adventure minecraft server? You could add dungeons and bosses
idee: crashed plane
That looks awesome I can't wait to play this
Imagine making a ctm with such a map     Anyone remembers ctm maps? Anyone?
how i get the map
On the small island I would put a castle
This man can rebuild civilisation by himself.
Is there a download for bedrock
Hi TrixyBlox I'm new here! I wanted to make a suggestion, perhaps in the Jungle or Desert, would you be able to make huge dinosaur /godzilla skeletons? For example in the desert one massive fully in tact godzilla skeleton somewhat buried in sand and in the Jungle pieces of dinosaur skeletons...please? The dinosaurs can be left out but I would really love to see a godzilla(2014 model) skeleton just laying in the Desert biome. I feel that this would give the map a very interesting feel...but it depends on what you think and what the other subscribers think ...have a nice day all of you who read this comment!
Is there a way to volunteer to help, I would love to help with planning/building on this map
thats so epic omg
i dont think my pc would survive this monstrosity
Tx is cracked at Minecraft my guy UHHHHHHHHHH
are you noob you noob
Is this gonna be on bedrock too?
how do you get the vanilla stuctures ? i really want to make my own map but i dont know how to get the structures
I wish this was vanilla minecraft man 😭
Every time I looks at rocks in this map I think a stone talus is gonna pop out
WOW respect!!!!!
HOLY FUCKING SHIT UR INSANE
With the create mod you could make the windmill move.
I want to live in that village
INCREDIBLE😱
Can we get this map or not
Try a Secret Tresure chest which is really hard to get to and has an epiccc story line
To make the plains look more like breath of the wild you should add chickens in random places in the village
tfw when there’s no goldfields in the savannah  sadge
Can we gonna play on that map
This is giving me ideas
I want to see more of your amazing builds 🤗👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🤗
maybe a graveyard with a dungeon inside it!
You should build a himalayan monestery in the mountains
Its looking like new game bro
you are a good builder
U should make a part of the world where it was ravaged by war
I don’t know how large the planes biome is but maybe it’s cool to at another village
this is too big. other than that pretty cool
can i download it to put to my minecraft world?
The island looks like...                                             A M O G U S
This is so cool!!! Wow
Am I the only one who is getting hunger games vibes from the map layout
Trixy that village is epic but you forgot the blacksmith!!
*jealous in bedrock*
The dude just said let’s aim for 8K and three days later he’s over 282K likes
skyisland
He could transform the stronghold?
maybe im just an idiot, but i have no idea how to get this. do i have to get java or bedrock? how do you get mods like these? are mods free or do you have to pay for them? do you get mods through an official site or something else?
Sheesh
I-I need moree......
when is this coming out?
When the thumbnail is sus
Is there a way to download this?
Someone make a mod pls for this world also use the wandering traders for the merchant thing so we can have a cleric as the leader in the church
Maybe a swamp and the witch's hut? Whenever i watch things like this eveyone usually forgets the witch's hut which is pretty sad
can't wait for this to be complete, i would love to play on it
Without using too many superlatives, at some point when you learn enough tools and skills, you stop "playing" the game, and start effectively being a an in-game game developer. Some game developers are map makers, and as such this is no longer playing minecraft but a game artist mapping a map. I'm looking forward to playing this map.
wait a second, I found you on reddit a couple weeks back
Dude, that looks really awesome 👌, if I was the one building, it would be 2 times uglier 😅 and it will take 2 months 'cause 🤔 I have to study and I've some others projects that take a long time too... 😏
Idk if you are going to see this but can tou make like a golem whit all the biomes
will you be customizing the nether biomes?
Wagons across the bioms and some broken ones like if they were robbed
Please finish as fast as you can  I must add this map to my server for my friends
woahh, i saw this on r/Minecraft and had no idea it was you! super excited for this!
Shit, I can’t wait for the next episode
4000 x 4000 is not 16000 bruv
Looks so great
I would like to see you doing this to the nether
add herobrine to the world in some form if u can
I thougt it was Fortnite When i Saw the thumbnail
Defo should make a crashed Viking ship
yeah
What about caves?
Maybe you could make some hunter outposts, they could have treehouses and live far away from the villages, but at the bottom of the tree they have a shop
Holy shit you're a wizard :D
More than likely not, but will this be downloadable on Minecraft Bedrock Edition?
I have a question what about the caves and ores how are u gonna add them
Will this be available on bedrock??
Is this going to only be for Java
OMG INCREDIBLE
8:59 "dedicated bee farm" "dedicated beef arm"
Tommyinnit?
Humm imagine a tree village in the jungle. That would he pretty sick. It could have those bridges and everything.
So whens next up load, I wanna see it be finished
Uhm I’m not gonna hate but you only did the plains.....
We NEED a skeleton or wendigos cave in the icey area I forgot the name of
You just won a subscriber. Very impressive !
Man, go work for minecraft. this should be the vanilla buildings
Include an Arab mosque
Minecraft needs to hire this person like dang.
I think it would be awesome to have a small giant plotline in mountains or something, not like massive but larger than normal, like an extinct race of people
I'm way too hyped
This is just awesome. You are so cool.
Make the texture realistic and like and like a Minecraft movie animation
anime
All the people that disliked are ones that died in survival in peaceful difficulty
i cant wait to see how he remakes a woodland mansion lol
this looks like breath of the wild.... its crazy pretty
You are going places. If YouTube does not work out, you should be a architect!
Idea time : the most important thing is to make it available for all types of minecraft ( java / windows 10 / bedrock etc ... )
I would LOVE to see a txt for villagers
This mens fease looks like CGI
Thumbnail looks like a dnd map
Love your content
This is so epic! Can’t wait for the next one! Keep up the good work!
Can you give we save with this world, please
Once its done then everyone can download it for all platforms, right?
i kind of like the idea of adding mods to this
Yooooo i am invested! I subscribed because of this video! Good content bro!
I think it would be cool if you also changed the nether
I suggest small clues found all around the map all leading to each other  and eventually leading to a treasure chest
Am I the only one who thought the map on the thumbnail looked like a croissant?
Trixy: can we get 80k likes  we can do 200k likes
Reminds me of ARK extinction... (the map layout)
Big support man!!! Keep up the great work loved to see what you’d do to the other biomes
When can I download this
please do a part 2
are you gonna upload it its over 80'000
Can you just give the map without any builds that you made? just for survival
This seems pretty cool! I wish you good luck
How do you download this
Why can't vanilla builds be like this?
For fuck sakes I wish I had even a fourth of the creativity this guy has. This whole island is so god damn beautiful.
Where can I download the map
Dude, Grian doesn’t have anything on this guy!
How do I download the map?
I need this map download
Someone please collaborate with Trixy blocks and make a mod that can randomly spawn his builds in it
Can we please play it and can you make it free
The outpost looks like a fortress out of Assassins creed origins. The tents, and tower say it all
hey could you share the world download pre-transformation?
80k? yes more than 200k take it, no thanks
Going off the pilliger castle idea further down, have the snow biome village be a warrior village that get most of there food from trade.
HOW CAN I PLAY THIS MAP PLS I WANT TO PLAY THIS MAP
Only if the biome are realistically placed like they would in real life
:OOOOO WOWWW
You and your builds are so cool!!!
Karens: MINECRAFT IS FOR KIDS, GET A LIFE AND A JOB!!! trixy: 😂
There's no way that's a minecraft we should call it ⭐ MİNE&CRAFT ⭐ now it's more good 😂😂😂
You should add a star wars reference from the planet of Hoth when Luke gets captured by the snow creature in one of caves perhaps
The pillaged outpost for the mountain biome should be on the backside of the mountain slope
Lol we definately surpassed 80k likes
Upgraded nether and end plz
the one thing i would add is a trojan horse, other than that its perfect 10/10  are the nether biomes getting an upgrade too?
This man is illuminati
Super interesting! Can't wait to see what's next.
I think you forgot to upgrade nether and end also you forgot to add other villages too
hypixel really needs to hire this guy for skyblock
That looks cool but also... VIRGIN 😂
Woah
Nice.
So you make a roleplay Minecraft story? What??? That fucking awesome
When is part 2 comig out
This would be so hard to do on console 😂😂😂
This looks epic I wish I could build like this
mojang needa step up their game. this is ONE GUY and he does better job building then a whole company.
What about ravines
make a totorial to how to make the hole island because i want to make the pilliger place and the villiges and when are you gonna make the 2 part there is 278k likes
how can i get this map
PLEASE ADD A BLOCKSMITH TO THE VILLAGE
can you build a hidden experiment chamber underground, where the skeleton of a dead scientist is inside the wrecked chamber, and the room in which the subject should be is broken out  the story behind it should be that some crazy dude scientist tried for years in creating a wither, and finally succeeded, but the wither broke out and killed the scientist  if you like this kind of idea (and i sure hope you do, there's enough space in the map to fit EVERYTHING) then like so trixy can see
get a mod maker and get him to add some custom mobs in each iome and make it sot hat the mobs thats supposed to spawn in each structure do what they usually do like for the guard ost make it so that they stand there and add bee keepers that would be like the best mod or map
oh nice imma be in the snowy biome
this is epic bro
Errm did you forget to put iron golems in.
Teacher: tell me who you love the most. Me: tells her TrixyBlox Teacher: TrixyBlox? Who is she/he? Me:shows her this video.
looks amazing
Are the ores spawning like they do naturally ?
I probably know the answer but will this world be available on bedrock edition
Please rework the windmill blades. I think they aren't really realistic
The entire island is Among Us....... GETOUTOFMYHEADGETOUTOFMYHEADGETOUTOFMYHEAD!!!!!!!
I feel like i needed youtube premium to watch this video
it would he cool if you added a flying island and a gaint crystal cave
Can you tell me which shader you use it makes the game look insanely beautiful!
I hop your next custom map will be in Hytale 🔥🔥🔥
idea time is to add more natural water types such as ground water and water falls
Attack on Titan World?
how do i get the map
will there be a mod for this
Him: *builds a giant custom world*  Me: *cant even build a dirt shack*
This is so dope!!! Hope ur already working on the next biome and i think everyone respects u for this! <3 gl
Would love to see a research bunker in the mycelium biome
Sooo damm good waiting for it to release ur video will be on #1 trending after ita done we want the map
when will it be out
You need to make a sever with this
This map will be available for everybody?
Did anyone else notice how he sounds like mumbo jumbo at 12:38
I Love Minecraft! And Really Want to Play your Map!!!
Make some Islands around the big one which fits to the bioms next to them but are a little bit different. Like the Easter Island next to the Jungle Biom, a couple of pirate island with pirate harbours and stuff like that, Hawai etc.
Maybe A MASSIVE Improved Dungeon? Have like Guard room Cells Like A Prison for villagers?
The real question is.... how long did it take him to do this😳
You could add a set of quests with armor and tools with enchants that are above regular vanilla enchants using commands where you have to solve treasures all over the world for this slightly op gear.
Bro this would be the ultimate Minecraft hunger games map
Lava pits in the plains are good at breaking up as well, after all large builders do have trouble making smaller scales engaging (you don't wanna run forever to get places). You seem to be doing awesome. Really wanna play this : )
A genius
THIS IS SOOO AWESOME I CANT WAIT TO SEE THE FINAL RESULTS FOR THE WHOLE THING
How about  you make a reference to GTA SA In the train that you want to put in the Mesa Biome.
I want to play on this map so badly!
make an asteroid explosion
Huh, decent looking minecraft channel, might actually check it out a bit more
I saw the village outpost and was like, so its tsushima but minecraft!
Mojang Has to hire him. NOW
Simple buildings? This sounds like mumbo jumbo talking about a 16 by 16 redstone door he made
Will you be customizing the nether as well?
Be sure to build the Interiors Because ya know. Survival. We want to go in the buildings.
You should make a futuristic, advanced civilization in The End!
Can you make the Red Dead Redemption 2 map in Minecraft
This guy is the best transformer in the world at least to me is so cool and does the best build’s🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😁😁😁😁😁😁👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Here me out, for the snowy mountains add a pillaged castle- like a bigger version of the outpost. This would be where the pillagers originated from!
Oh my god.
wait did you count the 16 million?
Ngl, ill definitely download this, especially for that Bob Ross references
a zombie inteligent woman/man
Waiting for part 2
hey i think that you should do a big castle in the middle like zelda
Beat god damn biulder i have ever seen
“Imma keep the plain pretty simple.”  Me after seeing the finished plains: *WAIT THIS IS SIMPLE?!*
WOOW THAT IS SO COOL!!!
The pillager base deffently passes the vibe check👌
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL I LOVE THIS!!! THIS GAVE ME INSTANT DOPAMINE I CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY THIS
amazing!
i need to play on this with my friends
Hope U change minecraft.Join mojang
don't pause at 0:40
Nice
bill gates: WRITE THIS DOWN!!!!
Hey Trixy I have a question will you upgrade places like the end or nether?
Add something to do with CATS! 🐈 🐱 🐈 🐱 🐈 🐱 🐈 🐱 🐈
What about the ice biome
"i just want a quaint windmill..." *builds the Eiffel tower*
Dude this is insane. Subscribed.
I hope minecraft will be like this in the future
This is so sastifying
When u got recommended I actually subscribe bc u r Minecraft player builder😁😁😁😳😍💯
To be honest, I love this. In many maps I have seen, people build massive, extravagant structures right at spawn. It becomes way too much to take in! Here, you opt for a simpler style in the plains biome, best example being the fishermans hut. There is nothing beautiful about it, it is simply a fishermans hut. However, the further the player goes once they stray from the plains, the more complicated things are allowed to become ;)
I think this is the literal fantasy world that you spawn in games-
In one of the forests put a sign on a tree that says "Happy Little Tree"
I think this would help if you decided to add improvements to the ruined portal https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThQsMJ2bbXI
someone needs to make this into a story mode
I think an Abandoned Pillager Outpost would be awesome..
6:53 lol
How do you get the world building program at the start
What’s the seed I really need a good map for my first survival
cool
This. Is. Jaw dropping.
Ohh a Jurassic world secrete world be good
set up underground catacombs type thing, linking all the biomes will this massive tunnel system to where each one has one random temple in it and that temple is the entrance of that biomes tunnel system, and have them all converge under the plains or mushroom biome with a main room where all the tunnels are themed around each biome breaking off from this main section room
Plz give a link to download this map in next vedio
Its just amazing how much effort he puts in his videos
Um, this may be stupid, but it might be interesting to add an abandon city with a handful of zombies
Y    Thank you for 1 likes i really appreciate it!
Different cave biomes with the new 1.17 update?
It looks like hyrule from breath of the wild 😂
sheeeeeesh ;-;
Among Us warning.
you should make a doomsday bunker
You should do an upgraded Stronghold
just imagine you could get hired by mojang for building on this high level
Can I get this on ps4
I want a enormous sarver based on this map!
Download link?
will this map cost money?
“Travelling merchant” Terraria players after he said that:
When you give it for everyone
this is actually insane
How do I download the world
I will recommend making a giant stronghold
A botw inspired map? YES PLEASE
Can you make part 2 of this video? I'm very interested
Suddenly, most of your cave builds will be very much possible with 1.18 update coming this December. :)
i am exited for the wild west town
You should make a data pack of all the custom build so we can put it in a new survival maps and the new biomes/build are in
You said your going to add things your not showing us, but will you do that as you transform the biomes or after you do them all and right before you release the video? I subbed forever ago, but not on this account.
WOW YOU ARE A GOOD DISAINER
Where is the world download
This is really cool, but I am greatly disappointed by the lack of a swamp biome. Is there any chance of you adding one in?
I think you should have made the stair to the nether portal crumble down a bit
Dang if this builds existed in minecraft i won't build my own house anymore but instead live in the village cuz it's so FREAKIN GOOD
You could make an underwater/flooded village outside the temple
The island looks kinda sussy ngl
Only if this was a downloadable map to use😭
can you please link this map so we can download it please
Minecraft with a side of Lore
Should’ve added a graveyard outside of the church
the thing is minecraft is not a good billder
It took me a year to make a cool house for myself  like  You Are Amazing at building
Plains biome: has villagers that are exclusively vegetarians and pescatarians Also Plains biome: has a farm shaped like a steak
I want to do something if I can combine this world with the kingdoms of gray mane by Jera Craft hey can make a whole entire story based on those two like the main kingdom is the kingdom ( I don't know a better way of saying that) and this world could be like a separate Island maybe called the Badlands or something like that it's probably would be a place with settlements and other things basically the kingdoms colonies I don't know it'll take some thought
I was trying to find the next videos about this world and then realized it was made 3 days ago 😂
80k? Obliterated and then some.
pls i need thi8s seed
This so cool! time to start a new playthrough lol.. It'd be awesome if there is a swamp so we get slime anf maybe a dungeon :D
A big mountain and a mine/house inside of it
Can you make it a seed ?
Is it PC only cause I have PE
But i dont get: How did  he actuelly build that map? Bc doing it block for block would take months.
WOW!
This man has some serious dedication.
TrEasURe MaP
dude this is awesome, keep with it please
where will I be able to download this when its finished? 🥺
THIS👏 DUDE👏 IS👏 A👏 LEGEND!!
imagene he forget to start recording when he was bulding
snow biome should include some kind of research station :)
Do the nether since you are already making a broken portal
I guarantee by the end of this build, you’ll be at 2 million subscribers.
I can't leave without telling you how good this looks.  I think I may play on it when it comes out.
this is so gooooood!
wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How we can dowload this map ?
Love it.
This is actually so dope I need to see more of this!
Why you don't give link to download this map/terain i don't know what is it
Minecraft in every Minecraft trailer
This with some mods would be the coolest shit ever, nice work!
You are a legend
this will make my potato pc explode
Your definitely one of the best builders I’ve ever seen
Will this be available for download after its completed????
how can you play this world?
Will there be ores to mine? And will there be ores under the ocean/ will there be stone under the ocean & will the map be unlimited ocean
You could build a ruined underwater city
Can’t wait to play in that world. It looks amazing!!
Mojang should hire this guy
You really should finish this world I love this video so you should keep on going absolute art
You could add a secret cave with cave tribes under the map
Are there resources in the ground?
Wish we had this in bedrock marketplace
you should do this again but citys not towns
Please say that this map is mobile friendly?
Could we get a blank version of this map as well?
This isnt minecraft, this is art man
This is so cool I can’t wait to play it
Perhaps in the mountains, you can have something akin to High Hrothgar (Skyrim) that represents(ed) a centralized power in your world; A kingdom that had once or has some authority over the land.
Can´t wait to play!
Is one biome you should have like a pillager capital
idea:i think  it would be fun to add a frozen monster in the snowy mountains
The best like/dislike rate you will ever see( you cant dislike for this much work)
Great job bro I really want to see the result
What if he made hyrule?
Give us the map link
Do this but in the nether
Yup...."Quaint" windmill.....
wheres taco bell :)
I think it would be cool if at one point early on you can find a journal with a riddle that kickstarts some sort of scavenger hunt for a series of journals that slowly reveal the history of the map while encouraging you to travel across the entire thing.
Can we get this on mobile mcpe? Please I want it please I want it so much
keep up the good work mate!
I always love seeing the builds you make and I can’t wait to see how amazing this is when it’s complete! Your time and effort on these astonishing builds truly pays off. you really are such an extraordinary builder!
Idea time: Make a abonded kingdom
You should do a War in the Nether between the hoglings and the wither skeletons
11.36 Travelling merchants: am I a joke to you
Nether upgrade?
How can I download on mcpe? Please hep
Very pretty the map but... Can you do the Zelda Breath of the Wild map? Oh wait.. you can't jsjsjsj
Idk man... the thumbnail looks sus.. (joke)
i'm literally 3 minutes into the video and i'm absolutely amazed at the creativity, talent and mostly the motivation! huge pog! my depressed ass could never xD
God bless all of y'all and always know that god and his son Jesus both love all of y'all amen 🙏♥️
if the idea is to create a survival maps, will there be ores underground "like" minecraft generation? I saw some maps before but because of the terraformation there was no ore underground. Really nice looking map and builds. I'll def check how it's going to evolve
hey! I think it would be cool to make a volcano, you could put some lore into it, like village ruins or something like that
BTW can you do  yeti in  mountains and make the mountain villagers have a temple where they worship and sacrifice things to the yeti plz plz plz
make a cave in the mountains were a giant dragon used to live, and inside of it put a lot of gold and stuff, together with he's massive skeleton
TrixyBlocks in the future: I will be making a ww2 map with soldiers and bases where you can actually join clans and teams
WOW!! SO COOL I WANT MORE OF THIS😆
Can we have the seed for this map you created for mcpe
Make an esteregg from sherk
Sending this to villger news
So this basically is going to become a roleplay world?? or it has the potential to be
Ima a new subscribed and I love the vid
Will this be able to download on Minecraft pe? Or is it just pc?
The wiggly whale frequently sigh because raven decisively own among a overconfident hydrofoil. noisy, gaping latex
Why you dont build that in survival XD
It somehow looks like zelda breath of the wild
Will the map have the files edited so the outposts actually spawn pillagers?
Everyone: Where part 2
This should have been colab with grian
This is actually so cool
This guy is so incredible. Keep making incredible and amazing content!!
Porcay
This man said 16,000
PART 2 NOWWWWWW
Are we going to be able to download this map?
no seriusly how
Image if Minecraft was normally like this
Hey tis is my first video watching of you love from🇮🇳
This is already looks amazing and really want to play this map!   *Maybe you can add a little magical witchy village in the dark oak forest
HOW CAN I PLAY
Can i play with that map because i want to explore that map and your build is awsome can i plsssss but im on cellphone
4:56 yay Zelda 😂
If this is the Ultimate Survival World, then it should be possible to get all of the achievements as well, that would be something to keep in mind when upgrading.
What’s the seed
Just WOW :0
yoo trixy awesome video, you should make a world where we have parts of previous builds that are floating in the void due to a distortian in time and space, like it has wormholes at the bottom or something and a part of a build floats there on a big chunk of land.
How can i download the map
Is there normal ore generation?
Not gonna lie this would make Minecraft look so cool
If you took the inspiration from Zelda, you could make a tent hidden somewhere with a chest and few weapons that would resemble Link
I accidently tap the wrong video, but im glad i did.
I’m really intrigued with what the Nether could possibly look like
yoooo you are hardworking
Jaw dropping 👍👍👍 I have to mention this, as the video was playing on my phone my jaw opened more and more
Where can I download this map
If you like big things, you should upgrade a woodland mansion, I’de love to see one!
Is there a download link yet? I would love to play on this world
Maaan it’s already 270
So the nether and the end next? In the same world obviously
Can I just say this is sick I can't wait to see what you do with the other biomes
1 idea is to make  structure like Middle Ages like a motte and Bailey castle or black beards ship
Could you make a toturial for each building upgrade please
Details were great
Cant wait to see the next one. Love you
add a herobrine reference as a secret
This is very incredible! Nice work man! :D
you forgot swamp
Can you convert the Stockhold so that it can still be found with ender eyes?
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INSANELY AWESOME!! I LOVE THE UPGRADED BUILDINGS AND BIOMES!
Put a dungeon plsss
I hope there is something under the well
Wow... JUST WOOW I sub and liked :)
Where to find the map. I really want to play it
I wish u were The desginer of minecraft
How do you get world painter
Damn, why does this only have 1.8 M views? This thing is crazy awesome! This deserves more!. Damn....
I had an idea like this years ago. And I have to say we definitely had similar ideas about this too. Besides that though, this is absolutely beautiful and awesome! Also, I would honestly love to see this map have a volcano somewhere and I think it would be cool to have a beach outline for the island, but that is just me.
So cool and i have lots respect for u
Make a secret lab underground that’s super hard to find where it seems like someone is trying to make an ender dragon, but it seems a bit off
Wow amazing 😮
You should add area 51 in the desert
It would be fun to add a giant bee hive inside of the jungle
Would really like if each biome represented a state and each village a capital. Could also add remote houses and some war structures and a side story about a horrible past war.
Man I wish I was this good at building
THIS IS ACTUALLY AWESOME
a coral reef pond would look cool in the desert or in the jungle
Try to get it in the Marketplace for xbox mobile and other
Can u Make This Public
can you share the world ?
Damn. Subscribing just for this project. This is so cool. Can't wait to see the finished project. :D
Will it be on bedrock?
Plz make nether too
270k
Mojang should hire you! You are amazing builder!
I can't wait to be able to play this with my friend
You should add a massive castle/ ruined castle in the middle of the world in the plains biome that would be so cool
idea: a rocket center
Nice job I think you can probably get to 2 mil soon, You are the most under rated YouTube. I have an Idea for the snowy biome,  what if you put a cabins and an escalator, like those things you you use to get up a mountain.
stunning
nice idea
bro can we please get a download for this i want to use it on my ice and fire server
Trixyblox - need 80 thousand likes People - ez  Also likes - 270,000
This video tells you everyone likes spruce wood
I wonder if you’ll be able to actually survive in that world
Absolutely incredible! Let’s get this to #1 on trending so that Mojave sees this. This definitely needs to be what normal villages look like. Adds way more depth and is almost breath taking. I can’t wait to see what the other biomes will look like!
Make this a playable seed for everyone to play (Very nice job looks extremely good)
Can you be the next creator of minecraft???
The map:  My ugly house inside of it: : ()
Mojang: write that down, write that down!

Lmao, another "jungle civilization civil war"
only if this become 1.17/18 compatible..........
Ur so good at this game
Why not a (after)warzone. You know the usual. Dead, destruction, ruins etc. Give it an impact to those who came across it gives the feeling of wars. What one could bring. India Delta Kilo just put a warzone anywhere. Just don't make it span across the map. Maybe made a few place each biomes warzones.
This is INSANE!! I can’t wait to download it!
Beautiful
mojang see this vid
Bruh put the download link what's the point of showing us something we can't play
I want some of that "I survived 100 days in hardcore .... .... .... in Minecraft" I want some of that guys do a series of that map .
After u finish the other biomswe can download the world? Bcp I want it soooo badly 😁
Can you put this on realms?
You are INCREDIBLE!
Imagine playing on this world on a factions server
Bro all I want is to download this map and play Hunger games on it with others, it would be fkin epic!
Just put a single pitfall trap somewhere random. 4 x 4 and if someone walks on it they fall to their death. No warning. No hints. Just a random middle finger to one unlucky fool
Give this dude a real empty field I bet he would make the next big city.

Plz upload and make it downloadable soon cuz I really want to play the map badly
Can i Download it in the bedrock edition when you are ready ?
mega man?
First time here, no idea who you are but i'm extremely excited for the final version
Will it work on bedrock?
I like how this has 269k likes and not even 1k dislikes that's how good this vid is
It would took me 1000 of years to build this
It's so beautiful I wish I could just download it now but I don't have a computer I only have my phone T-T But I still want to support you since you doing something amazing
I have a question, will you be doing anything with the nether? or the End/End City? Edit: Just got to the end of the video and I have to say this is amazing and I will wait happily to actually play it!!
AWESOME upgrades!! cant wait for the rest of the series :)))
Make a new mob...A monster in the snowy mountains
can you download this to minecraft mobile?
Yo that lit
What the f***   How.. This is to good
imagine mc made this a seed and someone joned it and was like "wtf"
Your teeth are a little yellow, but the builds are great.
An abandoned military base with a secret bunker
This is by far the best build you've ever done!
Imagine using mods on this world and turning it into an amazing rpg map (sorry if I’m not clear someone who replies will probably k is what I mean)
How do you accidentally make something two times bigger than what its supposed to be😂😂😂
Legittttt
Part 2.
You should add a run down urban area to one if the biomes.
You know what? You've got my attention. I'll be sticking around to see where this project goes, and maybe even some more of your content as well. Good luck with this massive undertaking!
you are the best minecraft builder ever.
Am I the only one wondering what happened to his eye?
this is literally amazing!!!
Will you please give the world seed of this
Will the map be available on bedrock?
Yo I’m just sujesting to do a mob change like big foot and then a aliens
Mojang needs to hire this guy
You should put a diary in the pillaged outpost about attacking the village and a diary in ghe village about a failed pillaged attempt on the same date!
On the mushroom island you should make a really big mushroom in the middle and make it a house for mushroom people that own the mooshrooms.
Can i download it?
You should do the nether to
Why isn’t this in the game
I would build something viking inspired in the taiga
Yooo TrixyBlox , we made it !!! Over 80k !!! WHERE IS THE MAP ? 😅🤣🤣
Yo idk why I thought your face was a filter or is it a filter ??
oo
Idea: I dont know if you'll be also changing the end (or if there will be an end to beggin with) but I think it woul be awsome if you made some kind of "houses" or "villages" for the endermen that could be, of course, way taller than normal village houses
This is so awesome
whats up with your bottom teeth
Once I found a giant ruined portal directly where I spawned and I was so suprised.
This guy is too good
waiting for next part
You look like a robot
This might be asking for to much but I think it would be cool if you did something underground.perhaps doing something with a mineshaft or something with the stronghold
this was an insane video keep it up and can’t wait to see next part
The size of a church does not make it a cathedral... it’s dependant on it’s location in the diaceas
make it into a mod for other players
Trix I love the map but can u build a tavern I thought that would have fit with the theme of the town
I think that a murder mystery would be really cool to see in one of the villages!
I'm loving this project so far! I think one thing that this map could benefit from having some small loot to collect in the form of small Pillager camps on random places in the plains (Kinda like BOTW has those small Bokoblin camps you can stealth and kill)  I'd also love to see how this map would look with some Create Mod integration, but I understand this is a more vanilla-focused mod! Can't wait to see what you got prepared for the other biomes! ^^
Sir make it for bed rock 🥺❤️✌️
Great job!
16,000,000 blocks? What a madman.
Trixy, this might not be like- I guess actual minecraft build, but i want a giant Pillager outpost castle, with all the structures pillagers spawn and tons more
Ur pc: AAAAAAAAAAAAA
still waiting
You deserve 50 mil subscribers
can’t wait for the map
Ok. Mojang, Buddy! HIRE THIS MAN WE NEED THIS IN THE GAME NOTCH!
Is this map available on bedrock
Ok this video is blowing up... HF
You should add a large colonial city off the plains coast, and have the storyline include interactions the colonists/ foreign power, and the native villagers
Why not add a player hideout/base?
#idea  Put smaller islands between  because the separation between the mushroom island and the plains just looks like models being shown beside each other. So maybe small rocky islands in the ocean and good work btw!
Incredible idea. Can’t wait to play it myself. Sell your hard work for $10 and you’ll make millions.
Dude. How to convert to bedrock.
alr im going to sub cus i realy wana play this  map cant wait till its done
I love that the world I so huge, leaving loads of empty space for people to build their own buildings, monuments and so forth once they play on their own. This was truly amazing and I'll stick around for the rest.
I’m just not gonna watch this video now until I explore this map
I wish i can biuld as good as you bro you can go to servers and work for them you get nice earning the more you do
Dude this gives me chills keep up the good work
you saved my saturday <3
You should add an emerald in one of the villages
What if the mushroom biome was trying to corrupt the plains and other biomes
Best Minecraft upgrade ever! I wish you could help me for just a simple modern house
You should make custom NPCs for all the villages so the won’t leave and you could even make them look better Edit: Well done your goal was 8k and you got 200k
Mosque in the Desert would make sense, Buddhist Monastery in the Mountains maybe?
someone should make a custom modpack for this map
If i had a good gaming pc i will defienetly download this map and play the heck out of it, it's sooo beautiful. Keeep up the good work man
I’d like to see a lot of those like underground dwarven city type things and definitely lots of your transformed generated structures
Welcome to Bob Ross Island
Will you release it for Java or bedrock or both
This is how minecraft should really look
When you remember this is Minecraft your brain explodes
This was satisfying...
Reference the Light Birgade poem!
Will you be able to find ores and stuff like in regular vanilla or will you have to cheat fo that stuff?
if only this was going to be free xd :(
can we just appreciate the fact that the ad at 13:31 is exactly on the cut, so he finishes the buildings, then there's an ad, and then it gies over to showing the result
Dude just when he started to explain it I got insanely excited
Idea: a ravager stable for the pillager outposts
Too much is better in trixy blocks
I haven't watched the full vid yet but quick tip, add custom mobs too Monkey for jungle Make villagers like Tarzan Make a big tree known as the heart of the forest Make the mines dangerous with one wrong move and BOOM BOOM I was actually about to make a map like this and I'm so happy someone took my idea and made it, also what about the nether and the ocean, why not make this into a island adventure survival thing, with multiple other Islands, and a kraken and giant shark boss underwater, also about a boss in each biome like bad lands have big husk, dessert the Pharos also quick tip the dessert piramid in real Life have the smallest inside ever like you need to crouch and the entry in the middle of the pyramids, I went there, in the nether there can be the great big Lava either and also, you forgot a biome, ice spikes, why not have s giant mushroom tree in the mooshroom biome and have a a ice castle in the ICe spikes, I hope you read this, and have a good day. BYE 👍
I like the snowy mountains and jungle already. You think there could be.... how to describe this... kind of like natural caves, but the system connects and a tribe lives deep in said cave system? Like a bunch of tunnels that eventually connect to a massive underground “field” where a tribe lives? Also, if you want to make the jungle more interesting as well, I really suggest adding a cenote. You know, a sort of pit that fills with fresh water from the rain, but some often have underwater tunnels, too. I’ve never seen a cenote in a Minecraft Map, so I have a feeling that if/once you release this, it’ll draw attention once people start playing it.
Please add the Woodland Mansion in the forest🤓
I want to play this so bad
Everyone at the beginning: Looks interesting  Also everyone but at the end: I WANT THAT!
Me: Listens to what you're planning to do. Me: pauses the video and immediately subscribe because you're amazing.
I liked the video and i even leave a comment
This is amazing I subbed in the first 5 mins and I’ve never seen you before
Dude the plains is a bird and mesa is the beak like a bird
This. Is. Awesome.
theres a lot of stone in the village builds, so I think it would be cool if there was a quarry to explain where they got it from.
A custom cave
Glade I found this! I can use this to play with my friends :D
that is the wano kuni, right?
Looks like forknife
I was going to comment on how he didn't include the Dark Oak. Then I realized that if he did, he'd have to transform the entire Pillager Mansion and every room and thing in it.
Imagine you could play in this map that would be sick
Idea: scattered around all biomes you should add little tents for wandering traders! 🏕
Yo this is soo sick! Can u make this a download map for realms, it whould be soo cool and id love to play on my realm right there! Please Please Please make this useble 🙏
After the overworked is done, it’s Nether time.
do you watch anime or one piece🤔
Honestly I like the smaller builds better they look amazing
I need to have this world
It would be cool if the villages have some walls as defense against pillagers
mrbeast saw this be like:one dollar every block if you plant tree, litterally ages later, here is your $16,000,000
this is what minecraft rtx SHOULD be
Add a rebel base in the snow to represent Echo Base on Hoth (Star Wars)
I realy want this map its so cool
A strong hold would look great,
You forgot adding jungle edge biome
should've made the cart into the wandering trader's cart and the church being the cleric's
Bob Ross is always needed if no bob ross everything is shit lol  cant wait for the map to play in keep it up!
Make a drowned temple/outpost
Why is this so satisfying
In the desert/mesa biome there could be an Indiana Jones Raiders of the Lost Ark reference. (Face melting scene?)
What flavor do you want your map to be?  Him: Vanilla.
Th theoretically with mods you could create a rpg
WHAT HOW POG IM SUBBING
So i did a little building off camera
@wadzee needs to do a collab with this man, it is going to be epic hahahahahaha
So cool can't wait for it to be done. I have a quick question regarding the coding/ environmental awareness for each AI. Since you are changing up the way they town is set up and trying to add a story element to the world would you have to alter the AI's? Whenever you start a new world it auto generates certain features and parameters that the AI has to follow. I just wanted to know if you have to change/add to those because you aren't staying with the original forms of play.
One question, why doesn't this man have 100M subs? Because what he does is not normal, keep it up
ayo, where's the world download?
The tree alone is looks more detailed than my hOuSe
you're creativity is exactly what i look for and aspire to have for minecraft and i LOVE your channel. seriously keep it up trix
MY EYES ARE FREAKIN AMAZED
@TrixyBlox is there a Map download? It's an insane build and an insane Video. You own my respect.
How to install
Where swamp?
I just noticed he made the village and pillage update better
Bro i want your world map
Is there any way to download this world?
I am so hyped for this to come out!
This video said dummies you dummies
Broo how can we play your minecraft map
I guess adding the *Swamp* biome is a *GREAT* idea..
Create a meteor crater
Will you make one for bedrock or this one plz
Swamp?
SO GOOD
Stop maar met roken donder op
Bruh... he's too good. Keep up the incredible work!
idk why but this reminds me of sao
Pleas sende the cod for this build in the cements
263k likes compared to 700. GG! and lovely map

My PC would explode if I played this man 😂
This is great! I love Minecraft mega builds and love how you actually made the map so much bigger! Please do more of this!
Wow 👏👏
The wither shrine with it telling the story of the wither.
I HAVE TO GET THIS
I love this map!!! How do you download this world
Do a Jumanji style mountain with an animal head carved onto it
You know that 1 in 100 video I  that recommendations that is accualy really entertaining and you watch the whole video . Ya this is it
That map lookin a bit sussy
hope you also add a lot of underground structures   would be Awsom
10:16 “Really minor changes”

I wish I had Java edition
Pls download for map
I would love to see Jimmy, Karl, Chris and Chandler to play this
Make a cooler woodland mansion in the dark oak biome!!
This is bordlerline wynncraft stuff
Unsure if you already started or had this planned, but I suggest basing the Desert off of the Arabian Deserts.
Where do you get the smell I need the link to the person that made this video send me the link in the chat or comment the link
wow. just WOW. that is extremely impressive. i'm impressed.
Pls tell me how to download this map
You need to make sure that pillagers actually spawn in their outposts, cartographer villagers and fed dolphins work, etc. I suggest using a data pack for this, though some of it could be accomplished with MCEdit or the like or just mob spawners or maybe command blocks
What is this... Skyrim?
If there’s a way for you to put it on bedrock then you should do it I don’t have access to Java
*a quaint windmill* litterly makes a giant windmill that there’s no way I could make
The elastic alto virtually smoke because learning markedly excite pro a kindhearted bagpipe. heavenly heavy hellish, heavenly heavy hellish needle
... when you see something so beautiful and you wanted but you remember you're on a different version... And you have maybe deleted every single father van accident... Please don't judge me it's not my fault I wanted one thing that no one has gotten yet from valve themselves
Woodland mansion transformation in the dark oak forest????   if not, separate video?  I want to see your take on it.
Add lore. It might take a while but it lets people find out things and make it more fun
i feel sad for the 800 people who disliked, they don't have a good taste voor good content
Make this a survival games map just imagine..
Trixy I'm working on making a kingdom based on the pillager outpost
"I'm doing this alone...with the help of my girlfriend"  😆
How do I get the world
This looks amazing, I hope we get to see more!
Genshin impact be like:
what about a reef in the Coast next to the mushroom island, with a treasure in the bottom or smth
I need this
damnnnn
This guy architect skill is insane
Will this map be available in a bedrock version :)?
So I think we beat the 80k like goal
maybe you can do a ravine near the island? but under water. Or maybe a giant fossil in middle of a pit? idk i have so many ideas
Reminds me of hunter x hunter (the island game thing)
This is AMAZING!!
For the desert biome i was thinking that something underground would be cool almost like an abandoned mineshaft but with desert loot. A place where you could find cool treasure as well for people to find.
Will I need to be a part of your Patreon to get this world download when you finish
Can we have region that worships Water Sheep? lmao
This is what he say simple even its so hard to build lol
Wow
Too bad Xbox can't download custom worlds
get a life bro
Download?
When the map is sus
This guy is my inspiration for building things that look awesome not as good as him but still
can we get the install link
Wow. Looking forward to the final product!
Very cool,I subbed
I NEED THIS WORLD
You should in some random cave create a giant abandoned dragons lair with gold and chests, etc. In the wall of a cave, you could have a darker section of a wall, then it opens to a huge cavern with a dragon skeleton. Something kinda like how RL craft does it. Just a thought.
Nice builds!
If only I have java
When is the code for map coming out also you got a subscriber For you hard work and creativity
Is this map only java?
Love you content and your dedication its always a pleasure to watch
yoo the guy from reddit
Bro mincraft better be taking notes 🤣👍
The whole island just reminds me of that island where Bionicles lived.
World download?
That map is godlike and kinda life-like too. Amazing work!
Daaaamnnnnnn!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥😍
i cant wait for the next one
i had 7 ads in this video?
Can you include a abounded airport?
Add me as a friendly pilager in a camp and a ravenger named Bessy.
Yooooo is more like real life! I like it
Put a never gonna give you up picture on a desert temple
i got so much building ideas from this keep up the good content :)
What if mojang relleas that biomes in mincraft
Can't wait to play on this map You've done an amazing world map
You are so good at building and I honestly think it would be cool to have a few houses on mushroom island with some mushroom crops and mooshroom farm 👍
this is soooo sick. I’m actually really excited to see this project unfold
So much hard work in just 15 minutes hats🥰🥰👍🏻👍🏻👏🏻👏🏻
OMG that is amazing, Trixy just an idea. Why dont you, with a modder or just you, create a mod to add a boss for each biome, it would be awsome, congrats man, that is amazing
also break up the portal rune stairs a bit with holes and dents
can you make it for survival map so me and my friend s can make it as the survival server and pls make those nice trees to regentrate after thye get cut becuase you know so we dont make the world ugly if you could thta would be wholesome
I know I’m gonna get some hate for this… but wouldn’t it be kinda cool if Dream did a manhunt on this..?
Its... Its...   Its Beautiful!
I think we Need an arena in there
Lol 260k likes, a bit over 80k, can't wait for download
Ultimate croissant
Aaaahh..... Very satisfying.
just imagine what he could do with an Animal Crossing island.
The people who are working on Minecraft biomes are going to get fired by this man
When is part two coming out?
This would just be resource heaven for minecraft players
Plot twist: he did this all in survival
Will it be on xbox ps
Trixy, I saw everything upgrading in part one and I was amazed! I subbed, liked the vid, clicked the bell, and I cant wait to watch part 2!
Bedrock map Pls
Wow i have never seen such a good and beautiful minecraft map or world i like it cuz its almodt vanilla but better
Do the villagers had more home
Will you make another one after 1.17 drops?
i love your buildings if i ask can you make me a cyberpunk2077 city
I want mojang update again Minecraft  like this I really like it
NI
This is awesome!! 😍🤯 subbed & liked!
Bedrock?
You are amazing !!!
.-. gonna be sub server? plese ?
Woah this is sick
First saw this on Reddit, then got recommended on YouTube literally 2 minutes after.
please give us part two like you were trending we deserve it
Dude you are amazing great job awosome content. I have a suggestion about thiw progect. Is it possible to make a small village inside a cave on the snowy mountains or is that too difficult ??
260k likes I think we will get world download
wow
butiful
6:35 the flag is flying in the opposite direction as the wind
Bro,why don't you make a under ground civilization in one of the biome,if you like this idea just react it plllzzzzz
I honestly don’t understand why Mojang don’t hire people to build new structures lol
Adding a 'yeti' cave in the snow biome would be cool😀
You put a forgery in there?
This reminds me of mu megabase
I just really hope he changes the chest loot in the villages and the pillager outpost because if anything needs an upgrade it should be that.
Im reely look forward to play in this world
The amount of pain he has to go though
a lord of the rings type quest with a volcano and having to destroy a specific thing with many challenges along the way
Ive only played on mobile phone it looks so different on a good computer
i like more this kind of buildings rather than the huuuuuuge ones. When those are so huge it doesn't even look like minecraft anymore, but this ones are epic at it's epicness
This builds makes me remember the days when Aphmaus roleplay series called my diaries. It's like almost the same builds
awsome
Thats about the size of a real Minecraft world
me and my cat somehow slept from your voice, its so calm and nice
mate I'm literally shocked on how good this is
dd anyone realze he ddnt do a lrary
This look amazing.And also why do people still dislike the video.
I really wanted to put the meme which said "I have been looking at this for 4 hours . Its beautiful "
idea: underground village, ya know like a place for miner villagers and built structures inside  maybe a mountain village, its like a big and wide ranges of mountains with a village built on top of the mountains or maybe around it   a village in an island on the middle of the ocean   a mystic forest and there you could place some mobs that we rarely or maybe never see like that fairy mob ya know those tiny creatures with wings(forgot the name)   something like a _tree of life_ a big giant tree in the middle of the swamp maybe  underground forest?  tombs  pyramids on the dessert also an oasis
Trixy:let’s keep thing simple me: ya literally just made every thing real life man.
I recommend a graveyard in the village  Dont ask me why but that would be good... I think?
mojang, why u not hire da guy yet?
Looks a bit like cyrodiil cool.
I noticed that you had a jungle, but no jungle temple... I know that for a long time now, that the jungle temple has become very..., "loot and leave" but i always loved their dark and mythical ambiance...
Can’t wait to play in this world!
Can you make it on bedrock so we can play?
I think that a kraken or some Greece   god references will be crazy
Can't wait for the next video
i hope this map will be free, i so wanna play it when it's released
That... That's Mata Nui
I was hoping there was going to be a swamp
You could add underwater rivers and caves to explore near the ocean temple
The biome transitions look very sharp. It would be great if you fix that.
Idea: if you can set the spawn point if this map have it be a big ship wreak with some starting items and what not.
It looks like Breath of the Wild meets Skyrim that also meets Minecraft in both generated structures and the size of the map. Mojang should seriously consider setting the default map to be something like this to accommodate later updates.   Plus, I would love to play on this map.
Can we pls get this map on bedrock edition ?
Maybe add a little bit of bony tribe in the mesa biome and that would be Cool
Its beautiful
Would this be available for PlayStation
I saw this on reddit before this video lol
Ong last I was here there was24k likes now 200k
For the mountains, I think you should make a hut with good loot, and a big mine. Just an idea.
Not sure if you've already thought about this,but a couple of Easter eggs here and there including like your own base or something hidden somewhere would be really fun to explore. Something to explore that isn't there in vanilla Minecraft basically. Also I'm hyped about the lore that can be made in this world. Having patience is difficult eh?!
I’m getting windhelm from Skyrim vibes when I see the plane’s village
And what about the nether ? '-'
This is so awesome!
The thumbnail is pretty sus
Liked and subbed!
I can see wyncraft vibes XD
The layout kinda reminds me of the hunger games catching fire clock design
Is this eventually going to be available to download download play?
This looks amazing so far but it is only going to get better
Try adding some bamboo Forest, and some small roads like that of BOTW, adding also a maze like canyon at the desert will greatly compliment the survival theme of the map, others like swampy areas, and swamp villages which is literally above the water. And also river villages, i often see that history books as a major trading point.
If my skill is this good end still don't get me a girlfriend idono what can XD
Him: get this to 80k likes Me: finally... a worthy challenge
Lol you forgot one structure, the swamp hut
YES FINALLY.
You should make a hole flying city over a biome.
Dude, this is awesome! Keep it up.
Include a secret lab please
Include a secret lab please
Include a secret lab please
Include a secret lab please
I just subscribed bro can't wait letsss goooooooooood😁😁
You should add a broken down city like it was in a natural disaster or something

big b n
if i was one of the dream smp member  id rather leave lemanberg and moved in this realm
“And maybe even a Bob Ross reference” Hmmm ok...
where can i download this mappp?? I really wanna playyyy
Can you make a version for bedrock?
Have SCP 096, or a king enderman in the mountains, that would be a great easter egg. Regardless, good luck man, looks EPIC!
Plz do a nether-version where, when u go very very v4ery deep u find a new nether custom world
Please say u added a woodland manision. I think it would fit perfectly (:
This kinda looks like a lilipad from amphibia... but not really
You should add custom items
Don'tq really play minecraft anymore, awesome game but I've just played it too much, I honestly think im gonna reopen my realm for this map its gonna be so bloody sick
THAT WAS SOOOOO EPIC
This is epic  I’m gonna sub this is too cool
Just add some dope mods and you pretty much got an mmorpg
Include a secret lab please
cant wait for my friends to load this map 2 fps
Include a secret lab please
Include a secret lab please
Include a secret lab please
Include a secret lab please

Include a secret lab please
Hey Trixy when’s the next one comin out
In the Grand Canyon add some pueblos

Create Mod would've made you be able to make things like the windmill cooler (you could make the windmill move)
Why isn’t this dude working for Mojang yet?
Floating islands
Pls make the next one soon
Minecraft 2
this is so very very pog
Make a rail road leading to different towns
Omg
Isn’t this just mata nui
Please, please, God tell me that i can download that to play on my Pc. Please!!! Would be soooooo great if my friends play on it to
You should make a bridge to the mushroom biome
I really want to download the mappppp
creativity
Man this is like minecraft (everything) level 1 million I cant wait for the other biomes and the inspiration from this is absolutely pog champ
Wow this is the first video I’ve watched of yours and it’s amazing!
0:50 80 thousand likes *smirks in 250k*
can i download this map?
I'd love to download the map is it possible?
Forget hypixel, I’m playing this (when it comes out)
6:52 dummies, you dummy
5:58 "but you will stil need a diamond pixace" that where you wrong
That is the MOST BEAUTIFUL thing(?) ive ever seen
You should make villager guards. With the new outpost they are going to need it.
The map is just Northrend from World of Warcraft
Can’t wait see what’s in the other biomes
You deserve 10mil subs
I want to build my own house in survival but won't do it because the structures he built are already much more than what i can do on my own
Please add a woodland mansion
...how do I obtain this world
I’m sure this project will take a lot more time. You should consider adding in some of the 1.17 features once they’re out and maybe even make your own custom caves or something!!!
Perhaps something hidden deep in the lake, it’d have something special (maybe a totem) for the player. And more mystery!
Do Poseidon’s royal mountain from assassins creed odyssey
Maybe add a mod it's called "create mod" example transforming bridge, moving windmill and etc.
Yooo this is so cool they need to have these upgrades in vanilla
Also, would be nice to have a flower biome
@TrixyBlox I wonder what if you get some people to create a custom datapack that rewrite all builds in a world, with random builds. Using your builds as examples to rewrite the world kinda, would been great
STORY ORIENTED PLEASE
How to transform minecraft to Terraria/Zelda
Suggestion: Add a pirate hub somewhere on shore.
Trixy is goated i love this
I hope you'll take on caves and the nether as well, and maybe the end?
Hey Trixy you should add a shattered savanna biome in between the plains and savanna The should be a little village on it too
This is amaizing!🔥
This is epic! Please please continue working on this project!
I got summon to a world with 7 biome
Mojang should hire this guy
255 thousand likes lmao
This project looks really challenging and interesting!
you should make it a realm that would make it where a lot more people can play it
Please dont show any story or secrets
my computer would explode if I played on this world...
I thought food was in the thumbnail, man im blind
SO BEAUTIFUL!!!
I can't wait to download this map lol its looks amazing already
Could you do a japanese or chinese inspired temple for one of the biomes
Trixys World speedrun incoming
Heyy I saw your post in the reddit
I am not Jew or any specific religion I believe in all religions and so I kindly ask can you add other religious buildings in villages I would appreciate that :D
Where is this world it looks amazing
Yooo this is insane! We definitely need the world download!
how can i dowloand
Add some more small islands around the map please
Trixy: 80k likes for part 2! Youtube: Nah, What about 260k?
You can also add some mechanical structures or crashed spaceship or satellite.
Wow it‘s just amazing
*turns on hardcore mode*
I really can't wait till the map finishes nice improvement it's really a bummer I can't play it 😢😢 cause I don't have pc 🥺  But still will be waiting to see the next part of the map 😄
the music the words the building this is all so inspiring. I usually never comment on videos but this one I had to. This is a very beautiful video. ❤️
Imagine he did this in survival and forgets to record
Go trixy I hope you succed
Jesus Chirst, Dude! The sheer dedication and effort put into this is unbelievable. I really want to see this done and wanna download it to play it with some friends. Keep up the good work! :D
VIRAL
13:32 This kinda reminded me of Meridian from Horizon: Zero Dawn
where can I get the map
make a villager who gives you random survival items
Me: *Downloads the world map and puts it in Minecraft*  My Computer: *"cowabunga it is."*
This is actually crazy! I don’t have a PC yet but when I do this is going to be the first thing I’m playing, and maybe play with my friends.
When u build better than minecraft itself:
When they do building off camera:
Mojang needs to have these structures
Maybe you can add a native tribe maybe make the pillage them cause they can attack the town and you could be the hero and save them.
Add a strong hold
"Hey what kind of art do you do?" "uhh idk" "Maybe you like painting or drawing anime?" "No, i like building in minecraft" "Wtf nerd, i bet you are lying!" "im not lying, i build things like a kings castle" "i cant even build a house in minecraft" *Proceeds to get away from him*
Is there a tutorial on those village house? cause damn they nice a hell
Trixy how do you get that shader plss show on me
OK where can i get it ?
The real view laparoscopically seal because maid essentially bury near a tangy rain. decisive, annoyed schedule
Trickcy
You should make a huge monster frozen in ice somewhere in the mountains
Me: try’s to build the church but I can’t  Tricybloxs: why is this so small
mojang devs rn: *sweating*
cant wait for the next one !!
should make a modpack that makes worlds generate with structures like this
Idea time: Pillager Outposts have 3-15 burnt houses near them, like they overtook a small town and built an Outpost there.
Wow I can't believe your skill in minecraft I wish I also have that kind of talent😁😍
How to download this map?
You know what? SKY ISLANDS it’ll be epic
Do something for the wandering trader
I would love to see if you can build a japanese themed villages I would love to see it get implemented
just wow i am so hyped to see more of that project
Trixy can you put this on bedrock aswell
Amazing video. So well done
Wow, i m subscribeing right now
*But if you close your eyes.*
Can this map play to android?
omg just wow 😍😍😍 . the feeling that i cant even built a small house but this my gosh so bomb
*a simple change*
I think you should do a Christopher Robin tree in the plains biome
This map, will be perfect for a RPG style gameplay
Trixy:its actually 16M blocks  My pc: chuckles   im in danger
does this map have naturally generated ores?
Damn i like the Pillager tower its so cool
We need part 2 !!!!!!!
Now do the same thing for the nether and the end
Pretty sure that island is just the Bionicle island
Do you think will be there a way to translate the diaries to other languages? (I'm here to help with the PT-BR one haha)
Dude you should be the guy that makes buildings for mojang, your building is absolutely amazing!
I Think i Saw this on Reddit, right?
Just wondering how long did this take you
Wow.
I need more
Wow what a work👍👍👍👍❤️❤️
Men can't wait to download this map its really amazing Anyway I'm a new subscriber,you deserve it buddy,after an a hard work.
This should now be the builds of minecraft.
Hey can i play the map i dont know where to download it
Can you add ancient miners for the caves?
Imagine notch saw this     "Get ready for the new update(≧▽≦)
try this with the realistic terrain mod
How can someone dislike this vid ? It’s perfect 👌
This is one of the videos I've actually liked, I'm loving it dude I hope you finish it!
Idea time: One of the last journals at the end of the map is a journal that has quardinates to a far away island that has the end portal underneath it. Something like that.
nerd
I want this map so much
i would love to play this :) i wish there was a way to get this world and play it for ourselves

To the 750 people who dislike this video i want to hear what do u hate about this beautiful piece of art
How minecraft tutorials be like
I wouldn’t be able to use this as a survival world because I’d be destroying a masterpiece
That island is pretty sussy
You should definitely finish this it’s amazing but  I really want you to make a giant Zelda Breath Of The Wild Map And make it playable
Who ist the Download Link?

Don’t kill me for this but..... when I saw the thumbnail I thought it was.... the fortnite map...
Give me the map, is so masive 🤯🤯🤯
You could make a village of wondering traders for a backstory for wondering traders.
You have earned my sub so much
I suggest for the snowy mountains that  -The biggest mountain has a campsite and a large flag because its like a tourist spot -Have many different igloo sizes -Cliff sides -And a tree house
this is amazing
Grian who?
You got to add custom mods
if i can get my hands on this map, i will make a youtube video titled: "playing the best map ever" or something like that
Would love to see a swampy area in the water by the plains maybe with a custom witch hut
An oasis in the desert could be very nice, love the vid
Plot Twist: He's actually recreate the whole Genshin Impact world map in minecraft
I love this, it inspires and hypes me up so much, you've earned a sub my friend ❤
Ayooo! If its done, make patron and "sell it" i woild buy 100%
Imagine build this all in survival
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽

It would be REALLLY cool if you add  a well in the dessert that inside the well has a lab like the vanilla iglo in minecraft! ALSO I SUBSCRIBED BECUASE I LOVE YOUR BUILDSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. KEEP IT GOING!
The thumbnail looks sus
r u gonna make a non-adventure map version of this? for an smp?
Trixy this is epic is there anyway once your done you could create a pack so we can download it and play survival in it
This is so cool, you could also transform the Nether, it's pretty boring..
You should make maps that people can find showing the biome or part of it
Can't  wait  to  see your  next video, 😍😍😍
I wish I could download map, but if I do my PC might explode
You make it seem like its so easy when it is the total opposite I can never make this especially if I dont have a team.  Keep up the good work!
Is there a download
If architects played Minecraft
U should make this a map bro if u can
Its there...80k likes.... : D
i actually wish minecraft was like this

WHO ELSE IS HYPED FOR PART 2
Will you release on bedrock?

trixy is it possible to use this in Minecraft servers as like a map for hunger games or something
Is it just me or it sounds like a hunger games arena 😂
This is amazing, perfect, U R the best!
That insane
I stopped watching your channel for awhile, completely forgot how amazing your builds are.
Ill keep up with the project! Seems really cool
what if we kissed in the among us island
Do you know the sky is like a professional builder is so good
i think you should add rugs to shade the villager's market stalls since it seems to hot and dry there
Ad eldorado plz or aincent stone cityez
Can you do the nether as well that would be so much cool
A hippo
What about the other biomes?
The map looks like Amogus
Bruh, imagine noob building a dirt box near that village lol
Really cool!
When I locked at the map I thought it was fortnite
Is there a download for this map?
That was amazing world, how to download it?
IM SO HYYYYYYYYYPEEEED!!!
Maybe you can add the swamp  in your world with mangrove forest
Brush your teeth!!!!
Wait I kinda want mesa for 1.19 update
Could you make like a magical fantasy fairy place? Like with Crystal's and giant insects? I think that could be so cool and really good for a story line
you should add among us references
Wow! This looks absolutely phenomenal!!!
Maybe even a Bob Ross referance. Chain epic
It's similar to CODM BR map
The problem with this is,you can't build anything cause it would look so bad(my builds I mean)
Will u release this in pocket edition?
Can i download this map?
Can we download this map later?
Minecraft: Breath of the Wild
When I seen the thumbnail I thought you were trying to build Wano from One Piece Anime.
This is shaping up to be my favorite project of yours yet! Super excited to see where this goes!! Also, we smashed that like goal out of the park; this community rocks! 😄
You should add a kono dio da face in the snowy tundra that you can only see from above or in a cave. Unless you don’t know what JoJo’s bizarre adventure is. If so ignore my idea
elve villige would be cool
An underground bunker in each biome would be epic!
we need Minecraft to hire this guy
i love you
You are are a good builder I love u
I said sexyy map as a joke but i dont think its a joke anymore
where can i download this
Beetroot: exist  Trixy: I'll ignore that
We need some pirates and pirate stories and towns near and in the ocean and shipwreck area
Maybe small islands with abandoned structures (THIS IS INSALEY GOOD BTW)
I really, REALLY wish I could build like you can.
You actually accidently made a new game 😍😍😍😍
I think u sould make a little town in mesa biome and around it some little houses whit skeloton head and redstone dust for blud and a sing that seas (thanks for your stuff -jungle tribe)so that means they randsackt the mesa wild west.
Cant wait to play on this world with ma frens

Build a broken titanic in the mountains
please download link
Honestly as soon as I saw the map's shape the first thing that came to my mind was Voya Nui Never thought Id be back there but here we are
xD can I get these maps?
The plains village could perhaps benefit from a church yard and graveyard.
could you if you are ready with this project make the world download for free because me and a lot of friends want to play this but don't have money. please
I wish trixyBlox and mythicalsausege should be incharge on building minecraft structure.
This gives me Red Dead Redemption 2 vibes
I can't wait to play on this map
insane
This is a very cool idea, kinda reminds me of the subnautica map in the way it's laid out
A
sus island
I absolutely love the work being done! That would be amazing to play in that world! I just have a small thing I wanted to say, for the village, churches were very often located in the center of it to be used as a place to meet, and also since it was a religious building, it had to be at a fair distance for everyone! Other than that, love the church and the village as a whole, great job there!
U need to become a minecraft developer wow ur so good
I wish minecraft will be like this and the texture will be like the life in the woods renaissance.
This make me feel bad for my builds
where download link? *confused monke sounds*
i wanna see more
Are we going to be able to download this? Also it looks amazing and I can’t wait for part 2!
I want to play this
Already looking forward to the end result and map to play it myself and as idea maybe you can add some custom villagers like a beekeeper and stuff they will sell and buy vanilla items but it would look cool i think for sure to have them walk in the bee garden :)  keep it up and hope to see the rest soon
it would be really cool if you add custom mods in (like for ex. Big Monsters or Unique Ores if there's a Mod like it out there) and add some quests to immerse themselves in the game and on the map. This would also very addicting to play so I'm sure a lot of players will play your map a lot ;D
those are the types of videos i have always been looking for
I just want to make sure, but did you actually forget about the Bamboo Forests in the Jungle Biome ? Or was that just your choice to not include them ?
have you considered applying any sort of mods or anything to enhance the game, like giving villagers dialogue or sidequests n stuff?
Oh my god I need pt2 Also when and where can I download this I NEED IT (Edit: U just earned a sub ;) )
Uuuuuum I think a good detail would be chests with uncommon loot would AWSOME
Will this map be free to download?
Can we get this to Minecraft Bedrock edition too?
You got me inspired
I might be a little late but how about a sky island?
oh my god,this video is popping,aim 80.000 like,and the community tripled it(this time when i comented is 247k)
I Just wanna play on this map...
Little more than 80k eh trixy
Imagine this with mods that add special kind of mobs, loot and bosses that fit with the biomes, it would be so sick!
Imagine this with mods that add special kind of mobs, loot and bosses lol
An ancient world in a different map.
Damm so good
pls use create mod for stuff like windmills. Create mod lets you move block smoothly, without changing their look, with only 2 blocks (but does not let you copy them)
Minecraft takin notes right now✍️
I have always wanted to do a project like this but just don't have the technical skill, would love to see a tutorial of the world painter and world edit side of this project.
Awsome
When you do the desert diome you should make the temple huge with pyramids all around it! And ocationally ad some awesome loot.
*Mojang wants to know your location.*
i think you should also make a nether world map like this which would also be fun
Maybe you can do Arctic fox and Penguins
Imagine this with mods that add special kind of mobs, loot and bosses lol
I have an idea how about add some abandoned castle full with zombies and other
when ur done this ULTIMATE SURVIVAL WORLD can u make Ender kingdom?
Huge cave-ins in mountains
You could potentially team up with a mod maker so that you can have some modded villagers that work better with the environment
Imagine this with mods that add special kind of mobs, loot and bosses lol
2:25 in bottom right corner you can see pp genereted by computer lmao
This is so awesome!!! I just wanna play it rn! I can not wait for the next vid!
For me to do this it would take a life tome. You should be really proud of your self
man i hopse this has ores underground
I’m not good at building :( have bad taste but this one is a piece of art work
This is amazing
Make a hole in the middle of the island with water and a city at the bottom
Holy —— I can’t even- this is absolutely insane
Make a cave with a cult of banana In it
me with a crappy laptop whith running minecraft at 10 fps  could never even dream to play on this map
this video made me cry. we need wayyyy more maps like this. thank u so much :')
In the wild west you should make a railway bridge over the canyon but make it broken, I feel like that would look sick
When this map Will be realised? Sry for the question, I know its a hard work making this, but I am so happy to see a so diferent game, and the mods we can use, like mo'creatures, Will be surreal
Instead of hay blocks, you could put target blocks
Will you be able to download this map?
something from naruto/anime or sonic/mario
You should use the create mod.
*You had me at Bob Ross*
Dude what are you going to do next??? Your awesome so I'm sure I going to be EPIC

Awesome work! I'm looking forward to play this map, both trying to survive in there and taking inspiration from these amazing builds :)
this that grian 2.0 you guys were talking about???   *somewhat agrees*
Hey
Guys imagine "Forge laps" doing 100 days on this map!! With like modded mobs and stuff! The map is just perfect 👌
So basically, you built your own wynncraft
Minecraft can be so pretty
This is sick, this gives me major Skyrim vibes
2 days and it’s at 250k likes
U r rlly f*cking good at building! The only thing im good at building is huge custom trees!
Can I have a backup of this world?
Pc gona go boom
This looks amazing! Also, I would recommend also putting it on the Bedrock Edition Market Place, because people like me would love to play on it once it’s complete
Can you do a 100 person try to survive in this map ?
I would love to see a subnautica reference in an underwater cave
This isn't Vanilla anymore... This is Chocolate
Omg I'm so glad that my recommendation took me to this, looking forward to the rest of the project
You have a million views, where is that download ;)

Talk about an amplifying service
Amazing job but how are we gonna find minerals like iron diamonds and stuf thers no underground ?
Its too good to be true
How much spare time do you have
this is insane! got yourself a new subscriber
This guy is so talented!
It would be cool if the journal entries from the villagers were a quest to find all of them
In a vanilla Minecraft realm
I have an abandoned portal way larger than yours
Yooo your a god bluider
Youtuber: pls get 80k likes?! Fans: triples it in 2 days
I need to see a flower forest on this
HOLY MOLY!!!! IT SHOULD BE VIRAL!!!!! 😲😲😲😲😲
It's so beautiful :O
Please make for play survival
Oh. My. God.😮
Custom caves?
When this is done you should do a survival series or give it to dream to speed run
nothing I build will fit here. Like the standard of builds on this map is going to be so high that NOTHING I build will seem natural I think thats also the beauty of MC, that the natural builds and structures are VERY simple and plain, so your first nooby builds fit naturally into this derpy world. Maybe thats also why there was a certain charm to those lanky cobblestone towers with windows we used to have.
a viking villlage?
YO wheres my download?
Can you make a download for this map for us
0:02 That looks like the wano map
WOW I want to play in this world..please give me seed...😍😇❤

A W E S O M E  I can’t wait to see part 2

Loving how this is looking so far. Honestly, with your skill, I think it would be cool if you made a resource pack or something like that which included custom structures and or structure replacements for vanilla MC.
Why Is This So Good?? I'm Serious Its So Good
Yo trixy, where the download link  Its already 200k like
Trixy you should of used the waggon for the wandering trader not the cleric but I like the idea

Man thats just amazing
I really want a mod to have these things on my world by default
Zelda botw is a good idea to back it off it’s like hyrule field if only there was a castle. I like how you put meat on the fire at the Pilliga basis like they are in the boko camps in Zelda 😄 The temple of time look so alike except there is no staple in the middle
Wow dude can u add me in bedrock and teach me how to build pls Gamer tag : Minecraft Car36
id really like to do one of these kind of projects myself but it will probably be a few years in the future in that case

The cleric “travelling merchant” in the wagon gave me resident evil 8 duke flashbacks

Love it a game were ur imagination goes 100%  were u learned many things

I made the cage more cagelike  Ah yes, floor is made out of floor
80,000 LIKES!!!! WE CAN GET THE WORLD DOWNLOAD
How can I download this map? It’s incredible!!! Ommmgggg
If you want to , you can make another project based on this one for when you reach the next subscriber goal . Here’s what I thought of : You can take that map and make it apocalypse style , because the zombie villagers from the zombie village have spread or something similar! Grate project and continue the good work
Hey will there be caves?
This is so cool
6:16 i just like the clouds
Воу очень классно 👍👍
Some ideas to think about -please make it so you spawn randomly in the map -please do some sorts of dungeons with puzzles in them  -make the whole map both coop and singleplayer compatible (especially the dungeons) -make some kind of story arc? Idk like missions or something  Just some things i thought would be nice

Hay it got more than 80k likes give us the world download

I think the sea monument u can do a medium or big sea cave
Mybe you should have some floating Island it would be cool too
Dude, there is only one biome upgraded yet, but i can't wait to download this map. Really good work
Very hard work to creat this
i would've spent the whole day making a custom tree 💀
Imagine this map + RPG mod
Holy...... do you have any idea how long this will take?
Make a central pillager base. And have some in the nether.
Mojang get him as a designer!

The island with several different ‘elemental’ biomes give me serious bionicle vibes. Looks great man

First
80,000 Likes, 3 Days In... and we have 235,272 Likes
This is probably the coolest thing I have ever seen.  Also a suggestion I have is maybe add like an underground settlement of people/mobs that live within like a mountain or under the mushroom island maybe? or perhaps deep underground near bedrock?  AND do you have any plans for upgrading the Nether and The End??? cant wait to see this project be completed and I am already hyped to play on it.
Where i can download this ultimate map?
Mans spent so much time detailing a village that is better than my single house
Alternative Title: Jeracraft's successor shows what he learned from his master.
Hey u should re build the dream smp
this is actually too beautiful to destroy it for survival
Mans making a whole rpg
Petition to collaborate with Tango Tek and make this map functional.
This reminds me of that old console edition tutorial world that had every main biome
So this is basically minecraft hard mode?
I'll be real with you I never saw someone that build so beautiful like this I hope you'll keep doing those videos!
im getting more genshin impact vibes than zelda but its very cool !
is that map for sale? i want it for my minecraft server, where i play with friends. is it so cool
Is it possible to download the map?
Plz put it on marketplace for console versions and make it 700 minecoins
i would kill to get it and explore it but ive got pe and hate playing on my computer :(
You should make your own let’s play of this
Where is the blacksmith?
For the snowy mountain area you could add a glacier
This is amazing a record breaker cause you made this ginormous map all alone 👍👍👍
Trixy and jeracraft collab?  Please?
Lowkey looks kinda like the "land of wano" from one piece  I see the onigashima island
What happened to your eye?
I play on don’t play on Java I play on windows ten so I am still able to get the map because it looks so cool
This could be a hunger games arena
What about a ravine
Can you make this a seed!
hmmm a massive 'Tree of life' would look good in the center of the map. could work with the story too?
This is really good keep the good work up love it!
Can I Download That World?
Trixy i would love to have a full on quest/ rpg mode for this map its like quest and npc to interact with and gives u rewards and comes with random loots so we dont need to go mine wood that might ruin the map if u break a lot of wood and ye im excited for this and keep up the awesome work man❤
you could add a volcanoe or crack hole in the ground
How many days did it take you
He updated the world, but not the Game itself  _Get your facts right, boy!_
ngl the view from the top of the island looking kinda sus
i really want to play minecraft at this map but i dont even have minecraft
I haven't actually watched this whole video yet but on the board I didnt see the swaml biome
Are you going to make it so mobs can’t spawn at the mushroom biome cause that would be cool and for the original biome
Make.giant ⬛                       ⬛                       ⬛                    ⬛.  ⬛
And you have to rember this is only the plain biome. I cant wait for the other biomes!!!
Gives me shadow of the colossus vibes
Yo this is amazing thanks
This video got me Right in the spot, I love the idea of basic Minecraft but revisited by a skilled biulder
You should have used mossy cobblestone in the plain biome when you were building the rocks. Not only stone and cobble
This could be a really fun multiplayer map with each group having a different biome. would also instantly introduce an economy because you can't get certain things from one biome that you can get in the others
They called him a madman
The island in the thumbnail lookin pretty sus
*Creates a whole backstory for the cleric while the wandering trader exists*
Will it be able to be downloaded?
Trixy Buddy I want u to challenge Grian to a mega build and a very detailed build battle
Art
You should add a floating island with some water dropping from it. It would be so cool if you did so. Also how about nether biomes as well
Yooo!!!This is a master piece!!!!!sheeeessssssshhhhhh
Zelda shrine with loot
This looks great! Also congrats on 200k likes in 2 days.
I love the map and can't wait to make a realm on it but I think u should try to make a gun thing on the map with a gun (if u can't do it don't do it
What about the swamp biome
Alternative title: “Minecraft, but it’s better”
WOA the map looks like a World box map
Imagine adding mods to this map to level up Minecraft's gameplay

Hey man is there a way to get this world on my ps4 minecraft?
I can already see your beautiful world littered with nerd poles.

WOW
This is random, but you should have a hole in the ground and when you fall into it, it takes you to Kin Der Toten from Black Ops 1 Zombies...weird, but it'd be a cool Easter Egg
Am i the only one that loves this map , can I download it whit out the big changes
When you're done with the map. May I use it for my server? It's not public and I will not make any revenue from it. It's just a server with my friends.

I'm actually working on an ultimate survival world myself, although it's much less grand
Make a few hills/abandoned houses and add some chests and then recreate The Hunger Games with 1000-100000 players      Even if thats impossible that would be so cool

Dream add this man to the SMP
Who the hell disliked this
You are God 😳
I would love for you to make a world that tells the story of the song Fairytale of doom by Beyond the Black. I think it would be quite a nice challenge to try to tell a story where the entire storyline is already planned out for you. I could never do such a thing but I think you just might be able to.  If you've never heard of the song before, here's the lyrics: "Blinded by gold and blinded by diamonds I let you chain me in silk You told me lies, I drowned in your eyes And in all those castles you built   Silver the doors and golden the cages Nothing was quite as it seemed And when I realized, you turned the key And I saw your eyes full of greed It was too late when I screamed   Once upon a time this love was true And I tied myself to you We spoke vows to last forever, oh Once upon a time I lived a dream I got blinded by your scheme Still my vows hold me forever In a fairytale of doom   Feeding on nightmares, stealing my terror You enjoy keeping me here I feel it slipping, I see it dripping Like blood and tears you drink fear   Silver the doors and golden the cages And when I met you you gleamed Life, it was pleasure, stealing my terror And I saw your eyes full of greed It was too late when I screamed   Once upon a time this love was true And I tied myself to you We spoke vows to last forever, oh Once upon a time I lived a dream I got blinded by your scheme Still my vows hold me forever In a fairytale of doom   Riven my soul and riven my senses I feel my spirits recede Dying imprisoned, last of my visions Your burning eyes full of greed It was too late when I screamed   Once upon a time this love was true And I tied myself to you We spoke vows to last forever, oh Once upon a time I lived a dream I got blinded by your scheme Still my vows hold me forever In a fairy tale of doom"  I'm curious to see what you can make of it.  Thanks in advance.
you should add a woodland mansion

Love your builds! Massive inspiration, and I can't wait to play on this map!
Can you put the download for the map cause I really want to play on that map 😸
How many Days/Hours did u spend on this INSANE Minecraft Multi Biom Island? And when is the realiese from this Insane Island?
Sometimes i think of myself as a good builder but then I see videos like this and I’m like: hey I suck.
Maybe one day all the Minecraft maps look like this
Alright, you deserve one subscribe for obvious reasons. And hey, looks like I'm the 11.101st commenters, nice!
You should put your builds into a modpack and name it something like upgrded builds. I think a lot of people would download the pack
so cool, downloadable even better
Woah that is cool and it really does look a lot like botw
Wano kuni?
80k? f that idea. We going for 200k
Already hit 230k likes so how about that download
1 out of 7 or 8 biomes
Damn ithought that was minecraft
I’m now asking myself, “why isn’t Minecraft actually like this?”
Can you upgrade the nether too?
This is seriously your best serie ever! Cant wait to see more🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩 keep up the good work🤩🤩
So inspirational
I love your builds
Ok I need this map
WE WANT MORE
We all agreed that he should be working on mojang
Please do Ruins. We need houses, we can repair, because we will never built houses that fit in this beautiful world
What if Minecraft was like this!!!!
You blew 80,000 out of the water
They should have the next manhunt in this map
This dude needs to get hired so all the structures are like this.
The literate minibus enthrallingly hate because sundial postmeiotically reply despite a savory index. disgusting, dizzy arithmetic
Will this make it to consoles
This is sick  I hope i can make something cool in minecraft  But im lazy so  Maybe it wont happen
it might have taken me like 69 years to compleate this
I love this channel
soup pond
Plz build a hidden becon in the mountain that you have to collect any ore block that you have to collect to finish the becon and a chees that will have a ridel to get the blocks for the becon and after activating the becon do a command that will give the player another ridel to give them armor or a surprise and plz do this it's my greatest idea I thought of plz add it
Just a question, Im REALLY hyped to play on this map, so.... are there going to be actual ores? Like its custom built so are ores like iron, diamond, and gold incorporated into the design?
Zelda is cool :)    (Well, look at my name, axe Dee XD )
WHERE DO I GO TO DOWNLOAD THIS MAP
This is really epic, a suggestion would be to add some large mountains large caves and maybe add some of your structures from past videos to here but anyways this was epic!
You should go to the nether from the portal ad delete a 1000-1000 chunks with lava ocean or just do netherac and make a  nether world but don’t rush yourself
YOUR BUILDS ARE SO COOL(◍•ᴗ•◍)❤
Wish I had the time to do something like this.  It's amazing. Great work TrixyBlox!
cant wait to do this map keep going you awesome person!!
Download link? Wow the World is insane
Why does your right eye have no eyelashes
Bro does this dude only brush the top row of his teeth lmao
If minecraft really add this to game it would be sooooo much better
Can download now?
Among us island 😳😳
You look like the British David Dobrik
BRO MOJANG NEEDS TO HIRE YOU
This is sick and it reminds me of rl craft without the mods
Does this world work for bedrock
I think you are ultra legend pro max builder I can t it to complete and dowload it
They should actually Add a beekeeper and a fisherman to the villagers
U Sound kinda like Tommy innit ngl
This is absolutely fantastic, I haven't any better description for it. I used to build professionally- lost my attention span for it when a massive project similar to this was lost with my old computer. Maybe I'll pick it back up again =)
i really wanna see this with no height limit
I cannot make anything this incredible. I am so excited to download the map and play in it. I cannot wait for the journey you made in this map for us experience.
And BTW way are you going to do the nether too
I cannot make anything this incredible. I am so excited to download the map and play in it. I cannot wait for the journey you made in this map for us experience.
That’s REALLY nice! Can’t wait for completion to play with my friend! I also hope you will make some custom caves)
'80k likes' LOL
Fck these 80.000 likes. Get this man his 8mil!
Pls make it available on bedrock
That thumbnail looks *sus*
This is maaaaad
Wow
I can't wait to be able to download it
My advice for the village biome plant is to add a villager statue
Imagine if this guy entered one of mr beasts challenges
this is absolutely crazy. cant wait for the finished project so i can play on it myself!
Imagine combining this map with the new SEUS Shader, when it's released
i just now watched your video and im already addicted
Will this project extend to the Nether and End? The Stronghold is an interesting prospect. You've got to wonder who built and why and how it fell. The Bastions and Nether Fortresses share similar sentiments: They're all defensive structures. They must have defended against something and failed. They're also clearly ancient, but probably not as ancient as the temples. Clerics, Librarians, and that illager mage I forget the name of could be trying to discover the lost ancient ways.
Trixy x bdouble0 collab pls
This is badass
This mustve took so long and then there still 9 more biomes, wow
This is amazing, could you also add in the woodland mansion?
The likes r so far AWAY on 80k  And wheres the map ?
Make a betrock download plzzz
I love the way you build everything you've also given me inspiration to to things on my own survival world and i could never think of doing something this big I honestly respect the dedication 🖤
I need this Map

Hey trixy can u but a viking raiding ship or town in the snow biome? Thanks

Bet he would win every build battle on hypixel
Can you build some custom biomes and new structures
I hope this gets released soon, I really like the map and wanna play it right now. So excited and looking forward to it.
You should build a hammer faller it is A hammer that falls on the material on stone slab it is for the blacksmith
Pls hurry up making the rest of the map, I can't wait!!!!!
Wow😀 how many days and months you build this...i am speecless rightnow😅 and this is good for a story map. Great job😁👍

Mans just made a new game this is adventures mine craft
Dam
Which software you are using to create a world?
creeper face at 14:01
I am subscribing for this custom map series alone (even though i don’t have any console or gaming pc 🤷‍♂️😅)
This is why minecraft is an amazing game to ever made!!!
Where can I get this map
This man needs more than 1 million subs man
At 15:02 I have seen that portal in my vanilla bedrock world
MOGANA really want to congratulate this man Hard works 👌🤝🤝🤞
Your an awesome artist!!!
I think in the wild West of there's a saloon that there could be some traps that sent arrows flying past your head??
Just a small request, for the jungle biome could you add in a reference to Star Wars return of the Jedi?
Mojang should hire him.
This is actually insane bro , already watching forward to play on this amazing map
This should be "building red dead redemption 2 in minecraft"
"The tutorial isn't that difficult" The tutorial:
This is masterpiece  Where i can download this?
Make an app that includes that pleade
When do you guys think he is gonna finish the world?
I have an idea add a cave of sorts a big one to and build a barbarian civilisation
why didn't mojang get professional builders to build the village and pillage update
Idea for a video: Upgrading the spruce wood biome
Trixy, make a stronghold like from SMP earth in the ice biome
Where do I download the island bro?
As an idea, maybe you can add a big castle in the middle of the taiga. Also very cool what you're doing!!!
Mojang should hire this guy i mean he can literally his artwork in making the structures is amazing
You could make the improved portal in the nether too, so that when you teleport to the nether the normal portal doesn't ruin the atmosphere
Left some resources in chests in villages, it will be more interesting to play map in survival. Very cool work btw
Can you give the map to play please
I can smell the bacon being cooked on my PC coz after I run this map, my PC's gonna melt.
Awww this was posted on my birthday!
How bout a monster cage for a beast in one of the biomes like the jungle
Maybe a elf forest village? World trees would be awesome
This is the best map I've ever seen
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩I subscribe and like
u build soooo goood i counldnt even build close to 1 of ur little houses good job
If i ever manage to play on this seed i will be sad because I will have to cut the trees and i will ruin the beauty :(
Also if you have churches in other biomes, maybe have some different religions, probably from norse and maybe some minecraft “gods” like the ender dragon or wither.
Can you do a collab with jeracraft?
Make a mineshaft thats not abandoned and custom villager skins
what soft wear did you use to make the custom world so i can make my own
Can't wait for the next episode
You should build a mandir which is a hindus religious temple in one pf the biomes as they would add lots of detail.
Dungeons
Part 2 builds:desert temple, jungle temple and abandon village
Bro that minecraft map is cool
I want this update in Minecraft
This looks like an amazing adventure map... a survival map? Not so much
Imagine him as the creator of minecraft and calling it "Minecraft 2."
I want to download the mao
Seems like moyang is lazY
you are sooowgood at building
Can You Make A Series, Pls?
i’v never heard of u anywhere but damn i love this build i cant wait till the next video is up
I'm REALLY looking forward to experiencing a new survival world gameplay. For playing minecraft since the late alpha, guiltily I have been getting bored of the game entirely. You have my full support on this project!
this lookls awesome! buit I'm also curious, does this still function like an actual ingame village? Likle, does the game recognise it as a village and thus does it have thge same mechanics like spawning iron golems, starting a raid when you enter with "bad omen", etc...
in the dark forest you should put a castle instead of a mansion
omg mojang need u
Maybe a valcano
Wow I don’t need Religion at school anymore I now know Job the earth was created ;_;
i really want to play this map
For other biomes, for pillager outposts, you should base the outpost on the environment, including possible increased damage or age appropriate for it. Not just having different source blocks.
Idea: Add a "magic sword" hidden in a "dungeon" to represent all tose rpg games such as zelda or terraria, I'm actually very curious on how are you going to do it, if you decide to do it of course
Ok but, imagine this with the Pokemon mod.
Imagine how cool minecraft would be as a rpg with quests more armor more weapons and magic and stuff
can you give us dowland map without structures thx (:
swamp would be cool because of the witch hut
Can we get a swamp so we can get slime easier

*mojang has left the chat*
Imagen if someone copied the structures and made a mod that uses these structures.mhhhh well... i can code a bit soooo
This is one of the most impressive things I’ve ever seen in Minecraft .
I have an idea for the more icy biomes. What about a snow cave with ice for walls and some dinosaur or an extinct animal traped inside the ice?
Build a volcano
I’d like to sea the giant remains of a mysterious monster/dragon type thing in the desert for example
CUSTOM MOBS please thanks
Bro you are awesome bro..🤗 Pls share this minecraft world.
Ahhh all the biomes are there.... Where swamp?
Where's the blacksmith 😶
Do you have a stronghold?
Yo!! Is there a download?
what if goose monument
Could you make someday the complete breath of the wild map? Maybe With custom designs added
Please make a small mushroom village
You know it took a while to make when you see multiple wandering traders 💀💀
Bro this is fucking sick, I love it!
Very epic
OMG IT LOOKS SOO COOL
man i want to play in this world asap
Teach me how to be a pro builder... Please?
Kinda reminds me of amphibia
The pillager outpost  gives me Warcraft Vibes   I miss the old days
How can someone dislike?????
A. where can I play this B. Imagine doing a 100 days hardcore survival on this C. You are awsome
Imagine if you became the mc structure designer

Can you made it free to download and what happen to the stronghold
This is insane holy shit
Three words : beautiful as heaven!
how can i download?
80 K likes? Pfft 200K likes take it or leave it 😂
Minecraft devs: HEY THATS ILLEGAL
Make one for mobile players
Im exited  to Play this
Trixy: I made one for wheat, one for carrots, and another for potatoes. Now with our farm done... Beetroot: Am I a joke to you?
I am ever so slightly upset that he didn't modify/add the blacksmith to the village. I know he added the stone mason but I think the atmosphere of a stone worker and an actual blacksmith is very different.
There are many ways to be talented in Minecraft.  But you literally surpas everyone else by creating your own world and massive structures :DDD
Will i able to download this map on bedrock?
Can you change it to bedrock edition
The library build looks like the civ 6 libarys
I'd definitely live here
Love this project!

Where is the part 2??? ;-;
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
Most patient Minecraft player I know
IT WILL BE SOOO COOL if u staystayed with the vanilla theme
Why not do every biome inn Minecraft and structure ? I mean sure it will take a long time to make and it will be hard but it will be fun to build, for people to play and you will get views
Your Acctually Very Tallented
His teeth are yellower than my piss when I’m dehydrated
Imagine this map was perfect for battle royal
The thick example bareilly type because armchair osmotically wave throughout a wrathful cocoa. unknown, hurt tyvek
Im so excited to see ur others builds. Espeacially the wild west one
Um did you create multiple structures around the island or just one??? I would prefer multiple structures.
It's at 222k CAN WE GET THE DOWNLOAD

You could have used the create mod for the windmill. Good job 😁👍
Bedrock?
I swear to god if mojang isn't gonna hire this man-
pov: its "just a simple build"
Can this be in Bedrock edition??
i'm not wwatching the part 2 so i wont get spoiled !!! I wanna load it on my server w/ my friends !!!!
The island looks like a crosont
I was here to see the MAX amazing World. 22.5.2021

FROM minecraft to A literally Chopping down trees with fist Blocky RPG
I just have one question... If you  release the map to download, will the stronghold spawn natural or will you make a upgraded stronghold underneth the map?
Wowwwwwwww
i sugjest a pyramid temple
I have an idea: maybe in the taiga biome a hang mans tree. With a dark backstory or something. Or a overgrown abandoned prison.  Would love to see something like that. Anyways, amazing video.
Good video, I couldn't stop thinking that you can take more ideas from skyrim, as soon as I saw the video progressing, I was thinking about skyrim
Mojang shoul hire this guy for makin world Structures and bioms
You should make the portal connect to a huge new fortress
this is awesome!!!
That's really epic! What shader is that?
222k likes is enough right? and please make it available in bedrock. I subbed too
This could be a monecraft battle royale map
Can you make a world tour after you are done?
Minecraft should hire you 😂

Sooo basically Minecraft 2.0
Sus island
What about for the desert there are bones/ the remains of dinosaurs (or something like that)
This is what a pro minecraft player looks like
OMG THIS IS SOOOO COOL
I  didn't know it was a church because it doesn't look like one and it looks like a ruined tower
the cinematics look soo good they skipped my heart beat 🤩
Mojang better watch this
Heh who need genshin impact all my comrade play Minecraft
Damn, it's beautiful

Wow nice
It,s not a game it's an ART ♥️
Those banners in time lapse😂😂.  Also, how the hell do you do this?!?!
Will this map be playable to your subscribers? As I really want to play on it :) I’ll even pay to play on the map:)
Man looks like he didn't sleep for days
Thank you for making this for all of us!!
PLEEEAASE add an abandoned Castle in the snow biome
Unlockable fast travel as you progress?
I dont understand how you have so much time to do these things, it's so awesome, respect my guy
PLS ADD A SWAMP BIOM
holy shit that's dope
I saw in your planning you didn't have a stronghold for the end. So I thought that would be a good idea to add since it's a big part of Minecraft.
u should enclude a snowdin town from undertale in the snow biome   sorry for my spelling tho
Wha ...... I JUST TURNED 1.11 MIL SUBSCRIBERS TO 1.12 MIL
I want to see a vid on you building the other biomes Edit : spelling mistake  for the word you
That Bob Ross reference got you insta like.
Imagine an AI doing this, but with different places, biomes and chunk
You should add a island about 2k blocks from the mainlands and have the stronghold there
I didnt even know this channel existed. This is the video that will make you blow up... you gaijed a new sub
Where can i find the link to get the world??
IF YOU WOULD'VE CODED THE MODS  SNHSHSGSHSVSGS THATS TO GOOD        New sub btw :D
A Lore? Take my subsciptions
the builds in this video will be in my survival world!
If there was some sort of RPG modpack for this world, going through it would be even more fun.
Get this guy into hermitcraft season 7!!!
Its crazy 🙀🙀
If this ever becomes available to download YOU KNOW FOR A FACTTT I'm gonna download it to see for myself
I wish this was actual Minecraft
This is awesome
I do building but this guy makes me feel like a total noob

This is really cool
Hi please add starter chest the cost 40 emeralds
Can you make the fortnite map in mincraft?
make a fortress a huge one <3
Someone should make an SMP with this world.
Villager looking at the builder  Is it god?😀
Trixy : make it 80k Viewers : Three times take itbor leave it
When you do a build contest You: terrible Your friend: =
it'd be cool if the nether alternate to this world has a similar sort of layout with it's biomes
I want more!
Woodland mansion?
Can't wait till you transformed the sea monument
Yooo thats insane!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
A murder mystery would be funny!! Omg that whole map is so awesome i Look so forward to it :)
Dude you should like hire someone (or yourself) and make this a mod where it makes the builds you did naturally
bro this reminds me of zelda breath of the wild, this is absolutely SICK   edit: 30 seconds later, I reach the part when you say that you took inspiration from zelda LMAOOOOO
Please make 100 day
Tryxi are there going to any ores
Ideas? Well, I've wanted to make a Darkest Dungeon themed build for a long time. It was meant for a modded game though so things like blood for water (presumably just red water) in the courtyard is probably not an option. For vanilla only, I guess you could put the Ender Portal somewhere in a Nether fortress if that's possible and doesn't crash the game or explode like a bed in the Nether.
Add a volcano next to the desert
It's better than the real world😀
😲
I wanna live there🙂
Dang
That is insane
Alt title: how to make Minecraft into Sid Mier’s Civ

Subnautica except on land but minecraft
A bunch of streamer n shit should play in this. That’d be cool asf.

Hmm...i wonder if i can get the world😅
Amazing
I should be proud of ur self
Will every gaming console be able to play on this??
Can I get the plain map without the structures for my own content? I'll give you credits off course.
Do you plan on also adding some mods for the new professions?
How much time do you think it will take you to finish?
Idea: add lava/water pools

How long did this take my god
God will hire this man to remake earth

Someone should create a factions server or smp on this, it would be fun with a big map
Yo trixy! you should add a flower fields in the Plains.
Dark oak forest need a mansion

Me after seeing this : pls let this be like 4 months old!  I wanna download that noice map xD
You could make a nether biome under the plains or another biome
Please make a video you build battle with smallishbeans
You can use some mods in this map, that add npc creation, like Custom Npcs.
HOLY THE PLAINS IS SUPER GOD DAM GOOD HOW?
This video makes me feel so satisfied
Can you add a custom stronghold and end area??? I think it would be awesome!
Thats cool
first 3 mins and alr dropped a like this pretty pog
At the end let’s see it with shaders and a nice texture pack ok?
How did je place these trees/structures or createt the landscape?
Pls give download link
In the wild west village add a bank with a vault to make the town feel more authentic and try to use blocks that turn villagers into the professions that they are suppose to be like the fletching table.
Those villagers must be living good now that you have upgraded their homes Mojang should hire you You deserve it
Wow! Your projects are so detailed and you put so much effort into them! I respect you :D
Trix yo bro you can win like 500 build battles jesus christ thats beautiful

OMGG IM SO EXCITED TO PLAY THIS AND SEE MORE OF THE BUILDING PROCESS, also iron golems? 🥺
Are hou gonna transform the nether???🤔🤔
*Mojang should take notes from you.*
This deserves a subscribe...
Wtf how are you so good
Could you maybe add also a Redwood Biome?
You should make a Mosque for the desert biome, cuz it fits perfectly with the theme
I absolutely cannot wait to see what you do next... 100% subscribing!!!
Cant imagine what happend when you collab with jeracraft
How did you generated the structures?
I am begging you, if you every read this could you do a full scale botw 2 map? With your ides and such? You are super creative and seeing how you made this I thought it would look cool
Playing this in VR would be mental.
sick!!!! so nice man, i want to play it so badly.
Is it okay if i use this map for a server (credit wil be given to you)
Dont worry about the world shape, its just pacman eating
"No this is patrick"
IDEA: your going to have to collect obsidian blocks scattered in each biome to fix the ruined nether portal. After fixing and going inside you go into a new undiscovered world like the nether called "Outlands" but all biomes in the nether are completely transformed and after adventuring in the outlands/nether you will fight many blaze monsters until you have enough for a ender eye. then you will go back to the normal world and find the dungeon the dungeon would have to be filled with many monsters and tricky puzzles. After completing the puzzles you will unlock the door to the portal room and thus entering the new world you have never seen before called "The void" or "The end" i haven't thought about a good name yet and fight the final boss hinted throughout the map in books or paintings the terrifying and evil dragon that destroyed countless cities and bastions and his name is "insert name" i havent thought of a good name yet and after you kill him you'll go to "The far lands" Many blocks away from the main island in the end and discover new things and become the greatest warrior the is.
THE PLAINs remind me of BLACK CLOVER an anime series 🥺 so inspirational
7:57 you should make that pond (or a different pond in a different village) extremely deep, and make it only explorable with water breathing potions. You could have a hidden dungeon or treasure down there. You could also have it lead to a giant chasm, with a custom made temple in the middle for dungeon crawling.
Just wondering is this going to be free
Holly shit this look awsome
If I play survival in this map I’m not even going to break anything because it’s too beautifully break XD
I’ve gained so much inspiration for my builds in the next season of Hermitcraft
How had you generated the map like you wanted it? Have you built it yourself?
Ohhh I saw you on Reddit!
I Love the lore of your stuff
Everyone is talking about the builds but look at them clouds dude it's so frickin cool
Pov: Clash Of Clans in 2030
Wait, where's the blacksmith? And the library?
Its perfect...  ILL TAKE UR ENTIRE STOCK!!!!
I wonder what would happen, if Trixy and Jeracraft did a collaboration
Australia, I like it
What a guy, doing this whole project all alone
Dont forget the stronghold
Make an ultra iglooo
This could very well be a MMORPG map. Good stuff...
Thats insane
You should create hidden dungeons under the chruch
The absent skate bacteriologically welcome because comma unpredictably fasten beneath a vagabond luttuce. deeply, brainy forgery
For the snowy biome try to ad a big frozen shipreck that almos close to the village
Try to get a mod in
can't wait for the nether
I have an Idea for a build in snowy mountain Build a Castle on top of a mountain
Aye Trixy i have a plan   My plan is -Build a Dungeon -Build a Stronghold but it fill with mob and little bit treasure -create a maze filled with treasure  And anything you like😁👌👍
How did i just hear of you?? Amazing work
Wait so we can play this map I just watched this vid so I don’t know if I can play this map with friends but if it possible then can someone give the seed or realm
Him:I'm still going for a similar look to the vanilla minecraft outpost.   Me:oh you were joking  Him:repeats the sentence  Me:I'm out
What app did u use to edit ??
You should make a massive futuristic core that is only accessible. By a secret tunnel
Seed?
MORE BOII
Man I want this please🙏 give us this map please🙏
How 'bout make it a bit fantastic? My opinion is a castle or something.
i Cant WAIT UNTIL YOU DO THE SNOWY MOUNTAIN BIOME!!!!!!
If mojang was open to the idea the should upgrade all their structures to make the game infinitely better
This heavily reminds me of BOTW, I think you should add a sheikah shrine as a reference to that game!
Your a god a Holly god
Pleaseeeeee make castle in the sky
Wooow sick I'm subbed right away even tho I don't play MC anymore 😂.
Very cool man
Hi new sub :)
why u added a bell in the library? library use to be quiet if someone rang that bell it will be noisy. just a suggestion depends on you :DDD
imagine playing survival series with it
I dont have too many ideas for builds that i could translate into such fluid text here in comment form, but i believe i could help with lore or story and finer details mainly if you already have a story. i spend a fair amount of time in a freestyle rp based writing server thats been going for over a year now, and building characters, lore, and writing books and little notes especially is something i could help with if youd like?
Shaders?
Pandora's vault has been real quiet after that temple
why do you dont play bedrock edtion
This is mad man , ur crazy. This is so awesome
Sussus amogus??????   OMG
it was 16 mil lol not 16k
Mojang should hire professional builders for improving terrain generation as well as improving monuments
Imagine this was the real minecraft
Add some iconic Cod Zombie Map 🤣🔥 or City of Gold
Whooooo my guy has build on of the greatest map i am subbing and you should to
We hit the like goal gotta make another video on this.
get this guy to hermit craft
Can't wait to download this map and destroy my pc
This is really cool, and after this i think that making a recreation of the dark crystal world (thra) that is also completely playable, you might have to do some research though because its a really small niche
Jeracraft vs Trixy pls do that
Can anybody pls explain how do I download it?
This would be a good pixelmon map
Too many trees in biome just make them boring, it's nice to have areas without trees where you can see the land and it's features.
PIRATE COVE
Suggestion= make a jungle house in the jungle biome and make i bear cave in the forest biome. Btw i love your build trixy its sooooooo cool even i cant make those
Yooo this is sik bro!
that look's so i can't get it in words
Nice job mate

Trees!
What about the blacksmith
Imagine a black Smith house in his style
is this in java?
World Download??
7:22 cannot Wait to take over this
I think you should create the  stronghold to be this incredible underground build. Maybe even dungeons in some spots
I think there should be a giant mushroom  on the mushroom island.
you should add a secret David Shiddy, other than that, will it be on the minecraft marketplace
I saw the island on Reddit I think
Give village iron golem and but gold and chest at ruin portal
Give the map link
This is awesome dude. I would totally hire you for a minecraft server builder and designer! You've got pure talent
arson simulator 2000
Amazing video cant eait for the rest! I eant to download this world but noe I gotta wait!
At this point you might as well make all of Tamriel lmao
Why does the overview of it look like my lunch in a lunch box?
I really want to download this map
This is to amazing we need more!
This dosent need any dislike man the is true hard work
why mojang never make this
Is it possible to have this as a bedrock world? Even if we have to pay?
« 80,000 likes and part 2 » Us: *well yes*
I say not completely 16,000,000 block yeah that's correct I say
This is so insane ur so cool good luck on u bro :) 👍
4000x4000 aint 16000. it's 16000000
Did you say 16,000 block ,yoooo!!! It's got to be good and fancy 💯🤓🤓🤑🤑😲😲😲
I think something you can add in the world, is a single grave, hidden under a semi-large tree in plained biome, who that grave belongs too, maybe just someone who lived there before us
Can u give the map for us to download it?
Damn I would enjoy minecraft a lot more by playing in that world THAT IS SOO PRETTY
What the heck!? He just use 2 materials to create a masterpiece.
I feel like im in 2018 and it is really calming
awesome work! would love to see what you can do using the tools in Vintage Story!
The only bad bad part about the series is that it will end someday 😭😭
Why don't you work in Mojang ???
I think he forgot about the nether
Make this downloadable for bedrock pls
Good work bro
that was  just AWESOME map i subbed cuz this awesome video
Damn bro I think you like building things, I could be wrong though.
plz do a part 2
What you’ve done is what Minecraft was created for 😂  Not bedwars.....
Is there a way I can get this world?
this is just boring🥱
I have a suggestion so in the ruined portal there is nothing no items nothing except a portal so my suggestion  if you want to take it in consideration would be that there would be a treasure map there and in the treasure there will be some starter gear like iron,coal,sword,armor etc anyways can't wait to play on it
No one :  Literally no one : Mojang studios : appoint him
Somewhere, maybe, I think a forest of big red woods wood be cool
You should make A Broken Castle in the Spruce Biome
The world is going to be for java? Or bedrock
Can mcpe download
A sunk tank
Ö what he thinks the church is small its bigger than my base
When will i be able to download this :( This is so sick!!

This is soooooo cool
I love it dude keep it up
Yoo download please! That map is sick!
Ow that was sick
Ur cracked
Love your builds. Can't wait for the other biomes. Keep up the work man and we will keep supporting you
This just goes to show that this sandbox game is limitless
Breaking mojang
You should encourage Mojang and notch to remake Minecraft like this
I can't wait to play this! This is really dope
212k likes in 2 days we just want to make you work
This should be Minecraft alpha survivor map.
I NEED more
Ohhey! I remember you from reddit!
First video I’ve seen, not even 5 minutes in I subscribed- this is pure talent and entertainment! I cant wait to see the progress!! I’m so invested in the story and little secrets scattered within!
i need this map pls, u can?
I love the world but..... I play on ps4 so I can't play it 😞
That windmill looks shitty
Are you able to get this on Xbox 1 ?
Wow bro that's so cool.😀👍
Dude mojang should hire you
Where is swamp?
I wonder how much storage this will take up
the village was so beautiful
Can u pls add this in block master for minecraft? I rlly want it :c
this mans using hacks
As a tribute to your Underground and Underwater Kingdoms, I recommend making a (MUCH smaller) similar area for this map. Maybe the smaller underground kingdom could be in a cave near the plains/desert and feature new caves and cliffs blocks, and the underwater kingdom could be housed in the restructured Ocean Monument.   Also, I would love for a mermaid theme around a warm ocean/coral reef biome! Happy building Trixy!
This is more exiting than azzyland's celebration😅
it would be cool if he could add a field of gravestones and tie it to the story
Can you add a secret giant sloth
Can u plz make this map for pocket edition 🙏🙏🙏
How do i download this?
Make something 69k by 69k W I D E
R u gonna do a custom end and nether as well???
You just made an entire new Pokemon region
Here’s and I idea for the Maza biome have a hidden rail cart that leads to an underground cave biome like in journey to the center of the earth
Herobrine
This reminds me of that Bionicle world
you went over way 80k likes lOL
This world download better not be behind a patreon wall!
I think it's a good idea for myself I'm just saying what I would do you don't have to do it but I would like you to do the inside of the nether
I would possibly add the Minecraft comes alive
Hey, if you happen to see this, I think something slightly more futuristic in one of the other biomes might be very cool! A group possibly starting to experiment with redstone technology? It could be an excuse for you to make some very fun machines as well!
Hey  can you include most difficult riddle related treasure hunt that leads to god's house where lies best enchanted sword and custom potion along with armour
I would make like three more Pillager Outpost with a giant pillager base where all of them come from with then I would go to the nether spawn is and then I would decorate in I would try to put mods that fit in
I always thought it was weird how their isn't a Dark Forest village. Turns out, it's because of the Woodland Mansion. If a village generates next to or inside one, yeah it's  not gonna be a good time is it?
When will there be a world download
DAMMNNNN BOI
I was don't watching you but i will subscribe only for this video
Can we play in that  world
Fantasy World Vibes
0:00 the world be looking kinda sus
Please make a arena in the desert Where we can fight the wither its fine  if it's not made
If it comes available, I would pay to be able to use it for my Minecraft server. And just a thought but, would you do something similar for the Nether if you finish?
Sir you just earned yourself a subscriber
hey trix make a giant mushroom hub in the mushroom island
Yoo wow
Minta link nya
Dream after watching this video: time to speedrun this after it releases
This gave me soooo much inspiration, I was shocked...
This man is a Legend
are you gonna transform the stronghold?
You should add a secret tomb in the desert.
Tried to copy the windmill on my hardcore world I died
You should make the spawn either a crashed plane In one of the biomes, or a ship wreck off the coast of one of the biomes.
Wish this was an official map😭
Can you add this world for downloading
HELL Yeah mate Good Job
This man.   This man takes up days. Weeks. Months. Just for us.  Put some respECT on that.
Seed???? You make a god map. I would like to have this in vanila minecraft
I like how he has actual constructing lore but the only lore in my Minecraft world is a man shooting himself with a glock-17
1:20 this reminds me of the arena in the hunger games 2
Umm can i download this in  pocket i dont have a laptop
Idea for Snow biome:Some ice Presenting frozen Creatures Some ice covering ores A cave with a campfire far away from the village like they strayed from the village with a chest and inside is some ice or snow with some tools And a book saying the story one portion of the biome story some book and quills will be scattered around the map like the caves the villages a camp at the open covering the whole Biome story
Meanwhile there is me, not even able to build single house which'd be pretty
80k likes...
i.  need.  this.  map.
As Truman would say “ This is B-E-A-Utifull”
You are very good at building and decorating. I'm impressed.
Can you create a video for 100 days minecraft survival in thid world?
YESSS THIS IS GREAT
since u r inspired by zelda botw, i request u to build the korok forest or atleast the big pink deku tree on the center of the mushroom island.
Idea:make 3 new boss and 10 new mobs and hostile mobs (23 mobs)
This look soo cool. Might I recommend random little things like stones that resemble Stonehenge or something like that. It would add a flare to  the biomesand can also close some dead space
0:00 when the impostor is sus
Hey can I play it on pocket edition
Build a temple a new structure
you should make a village hero side quest, where in one of the villages have some villager hiring warriors to fight back the pillagers by raiding their base in the dark oak forest,
I think he hit 80k likes- More like 210k
the f you ar psyco dude this is crazy
Jeracraft: “finally a worthy opponent, our battle will be legendary “
I noticed with the "traveling preacher" area, it's not at all obvious where either the preacher's cart or the cart in the middle would go around this world you're creating- there appeared to be no roads, etc. so you might want to make a roadway system where travelers could travel between biomes; and be sure that one of those roads connects up to the market.
Mabey in 10 more years you will have more than 50 million subs
maybe a crashed ufo for the secrets of the tundra
You should drop a link of world in the final episode. Are you gonna do it?
Neat
Can I recommend like an ice cave for the snow biome?  I think it looks awesome with also some frozen creatures or dinosaurs underneath
Me, trying to not be overwhelmed by his builds: I'm not crying, your crying.
Woowwww you pro builder
Try making a tavern for one of them villages. I wanna see a drunk villager!
Who found him randomly and started watching regularly
This inspires me to be more creative when creating a house or a statue   I wanna play this world so bad
Onigashima in one piece
Savanna update idea: I know it might seem like a dumb idea, but imagine a huge Lion King looking rock in the middle of the biome. Savannas seem to be over looked, so it’d be cool to have something like that
You should do what Skyrim did where they put notches pickax on the top of the mountain. That would be cool
you should add some small dungeons since this looks amazing for an rpg survival world!
Trixy said " Minor Changes " but actually a " Major Changes "  Well done and Big respect to you Bro
you remind me of the old youtube... a much more simpler time. Cant wait to see the final prduct, good luck bro :)
Are you also planning on doing a custom nether?
Suggestion: For the wild west area, I request that they cut into an ancient, yet futuristic bunker, with notebooks talking about a great calamity, and villagers in stasis pods. Think it would be very cool. Like so he can see it and consider it.
"I thought the cleric could be like a mysterious wandering merchant" **sad wandering trader noises**

This is bloody amazing. I love the island idea! I'd love to just take the island before you started upgrading it to see what inspiration can be grabbed from it. But this is some great inspiration!
I got an idea: add a volcano to the hill biome
Make a huge fort
It is so beautiful 🤩
6:52 Dummies , You Dummy

Yooooooo it is sooooooo cooooool bro

Are you Gonna Do the Nether?

Let's just say we went a bit over that like goal. Also I really want to play this it looks amazing.
Damn imagine him being a dev in minecraft comm they would be so lucky to have a talented creator

I hope you make a peaceful server out of the map... It's so sick
Mabey in the ice biome you can make an ice cave
What’s world painter? It seems interesting.
Can't wait to try this build
But will we have to support the patreon to download the 1mil special map?
It's so beautiful 😍
Can you make sure to add a stronghold
Imagine all the minecraft youtubers play this survival world when this is done. It will be one of the most trending videos in youtube. ngl.
Good
Oh my fuckin' god THATS EPIC!!!
Why dont minecraft looks cool  like this ☹ ... I mean minecraft is cool and all but i want thiss😆
the map/thumbnail looks like bionicle's map
Cool world I' wish this is an update
You should have put a bonfire and a small hut besides the wagon so the wondering traders could start it whenever there's a rain or it's night time I always see them do that on abandoned spruce villages whenever I'm playing the game and it gives off a nice atmosphere
Lmao not even 3 days later and its already at 209k likes
Daaang
lol it's far past 80,000 likes!
Surely you get writers to write a script for the island to give you even more inspiration
BRO THIS LOOKS SOOOOOOO GOOOOD
i hope we get a stronghold that actually has a story, as well as some sort of actual entrance?
where is the map to download?
I wish you complete it fast. I can't wait to download this world in my phone
16 million blocks?!!
legends of zelda breath of the wild is one of my most favorate games and always will be (edit) you think i can play on this map when im on xbox
Mojang be like:Your Hired!! We have now a plan for 1.18
@Minecraft, please hire this guy to your company
Part 2
80 thousand likes hell we will have 210 thousand likes.
you should get a modder to add more interesting features to the mobs
I have to ask that once the project is complete you overhaul it with mods to make cities with interacts or citizens, new enemies, etc. it would be so cool! 🙏
Please give the download link of this masterpiece
How did this guy make that island?
Nice 👍
Trixy, could you include something with the new nether biomes. I think that may look cool.
That looks way too freaking cool, like damn  Waiting to see the complete form and play the map
madlad, that's all i can say
I'm not only impressed with the dedication of this MASSIVE project but also the video and editing quality. My man, you've got yourself another well-earned subscriber. Keep it up! (I'm simply too overwhelmed to compliment everything going on.) ;D
This is freaking genius!
Supreme. Imagine that was in minecraft + a bunch of mods like epic animations, weapons and armour also npc and mobs
Broo!! Can't you try to make End allmost the same way like to remake the end a bit
Dude...holy wow. You’re just... I’m lost for words that’s how insane your building is. The amount of detail and time is just insane. That farm was absolutely beautiful. Just the way the stream was and the way it looked. And then the pillaged outpost. Just oh my god.
Will we be able to download this?
i transformed an entire abandoned village into its beauty state AND THIS MAN LITERALLY REMAKES THE ENTIRE MINECRAFT. R E S P E C T .
amogus
8:37 Ah yes, "quaint" this guy is incredible lol
not gonna lie the island looks like Mata Nui island from Bionicle's just stubbier
The nostalgia is real
Yo can you put this in the Minecraft store so I can get this on ps
Mojang needs to hire Trixy
will u make a bedrock map too?
Wow I don’t think I could ever have the patience to make something like this!
How to get though world
1.3 M views in 2 days....your better than any rapper
Hi where ican download the map?
Put a pilliger fortress
Should make an endgame underground tunnel system that adds to the story
My idea for this would be making this be turned into a mods custom gen, where every single revamped structure and biome gets ported to a generator
I wish mojang sees this and add this village to the actual game and credits you
Anyway this will be available for ps4
I hope minecraft use your ideas in the future
Where to download man
how to get it in phone sorry but im in bedrock^_^◉‿◉
Hands down to this mc god
Sooooooooo beautiful
Umm you should do you know the boat in sea in water ubgrade that
When you release the map, will the spawn point be far from everything?? I feel that is great, so you can start the world then try to find everything. (Plains village being closest obvi)
Underground Railroad!!!!!!!!!
Most cool world I ever seen 👌
Am I the only one who thought it was halarious that the plains farm looked exactly like a steak🤣
Make the ice biome as dead and cold looking as possible, and at the top of the tallest mountain, put a cozy cave that has either a monster or a lost/living alone villager
add some mods
There's actually a world called Paralon that is much larger and more extensive. I don't think they are finished with it though.
Your creativity is awesome
Here is an idea make a pillager village with a gigantic pillager outpost (150-200 blocks) in the Middle and around them 8 normal pillager outpost who connected whit a bridge to the gigantic and make a mine in the village a field whit weat an port for the pillager army and army camps and a big wall whit a big door pls Hope u make it
can’t wait to download the finished project
I want this map to be downloadable for mobile and pc 0.0 its so cool
I think u should make a treasure hunt that brings u all around the map and shows u all the different biomes and structures
This is EPIC  maybe add some walls to the villages to keep the pesky pillagers out? And maybe something Iron Golem related in the village?
Am i stupid and forgot or did he forget blacksmith?
You should make a world generation mod
hey pls give us the world plss
Cant wait for the next update
Lets give a round of applause for his pc
Plis plis
How can I buy this?
Add a castle on tiger biom
Maybe you could have a shootout between two characters in the old west town? They could add some backstory?
THIS WAS SO SICK! HOLY!
How long will it take to make the next video? No rush tho, I just want to know when to expect it
the island on the thumbnail looks kinda sus
Make pearl harbour nah I'm joking but it would be cool. I love your builds
omg this is soooooooo EPIC
If he starts a smp then imagine how good it would be!!!!
I wonder if dream want to play in this map
Mojang needs to hire you 4 this!
Its epic
U should make one huge ravine across the whole map
Pov : you didn't searched it .
Sadly i don't have java edition 😔😔  Edit- is there one for bedrock
This guy literally just made RLcraft Island (oOOOOooOooh... mabye a good name?)
I don't normally like videos but this one is insanely cool. I love the idea of creating a minecraft world but better. I really hope that I'd be able to download this world and play on mobile but if not I really can't wait to see what you do with the rest of the biomes and enjoy watching you build it. It looks so cool
Man, imagine exploring that map in RTX...
I think next biom is not mosroom not woods or any thing it is the fancy biyome
Imagine this to be l'manburg
Pocket edition 0.0
This is what we need
Looks like Voya nui + Mata nui lol any bionicle fans😂
Now draw it giving birth
Make a monke kingdom in the jungle or a  pillager kingdom
This is like Jeracraft!!
Is it me or does the land kinda look like Wano from One Piece
grian V2
9:36 anyone else see a steak

This is amazing! You are so talented!
Can you create a city building 🏙️
Download Link???
I think it would be rly cool if u made the nether into a literal hell and the end into heaven
Mojang must hire this man to make the world on maybe Minecraft Story mode s3
I wish I like that to build and also it cool
BEST BUILDER EVERR
8:57 ummm
I'm pretty sure the "bob ross" painting you showed was the one his son did. It was literally the ONLY bob Ross video I ever watched.
Add a monster/alien secret in the mines/tundra
Is it for Java only?  Edit: u should probably edit the nether as well
You should add a snow village like eskimos
Who else thought that the base map he made looked like the og fortnite map kinda
How to download this world
Can't wait man!
hu

Nice
woodland mansion? ;)
U can call that village a century later village or the next generation

Grian wants to know your location
Please hurry up with next vid. This was too epic.
Yo I just realized that your the guy froM Reddit
He is the best minecraft builder ,designer ,modifier in the world
Make a upgrade for a woodland mansion
Could you also transform the nether and the end in that massive sick map?:))
now this is epic
The way the biomes are lay out reminds me of Tamriel
this looks like minecraft but were smaller
Imagine all the super talented mega builders like grian, jeracraft, trixy, and more came together to build a super big map
the dark oak or spruce wood forests should have like, creepy serial killer shacks or something. It would be a cool, creepy find, if your just travelling through the world.
perdon de la monarquia, saludos
una casa de la coscu army
I just got this in my recommended idk why but finally YouTube recommended something I actually like
The like/dislike ratio is INSANE!
205K like!!
I hope mojang started adding this worlds to Mc
Personally, I think the cross on the windmill should be slightly tilted to the right. Other than that, this was a really good build, can't wait to see where this build goes.
Every build better than the previous one!!!
Jeracraft+Trixyblox: THE BEST BUILD COMBO!!
for minecraft pocket edition
Ok give us the download now (Can you put it on bedrock too?)
I think it would be great if a floating temple was on the snowy mountains biome
WHAT IS THE WORLD SEED
wherre issss doowwnloooaaadddd mmmaappp
Quit Minecraft for a while and this guy just made me play it again.
It was like "adventure time" if you know what it is
Looks Amazing!! Can’t wait to play the finished map. Adding some lore would give a nice storyline aspect 😁
Very cool! The world download file is going to be a huge file size but I'm still hoping to grab it anyway :D
Can u pls make a vedio gameplay
5:15 that song...
Id love a structure datapack or mod made by you that naturally generates these amazing builds
How i can download the world
Can we take a moment to realize this dude just made Earth in Minecraft
🦷
I saw this on Reddit first
Different title: making minecraft worlds better
This was so calming to watch :) can’t wait to see the other biomes
Ok so my ideas in religous buildings  Desert - Mosque or jewish temple Its giving me arabian vibe so like yah  Mesa - buddhist or hindu temple Mesa is giving me east asian vibe or china's landscape vibe   Savanna - orthodox church Orthodox church architecture is very different it looks like a mosque but it has a cross and savanna is givin me central african vibe and christianity is very popular there  Taiga - Church or pagan religion Taiga biome is givin me european vibe and europe is a Christian but it wasnt always a Christian europe was pagan before jesus become popular maybe greek mythology churches would be cool  Snowy mountains - church or pagan Its Givin me finland,iceland, other european countries that are in northern europe vibe so catholic church or orthodox church like in russia  Dark wood forest - wicca Givin me harry potter vibes and its also a dark forest so maybe a wicca church idk (idk what religion does wizards follow)  Jungle - mayans or hindu temple India is rich in forest and India's most largest religion is hindu but mayans lived in north central america and its vast in forest so yes  Other additions  I would loooove to see abandoned villages where wizard and witch use to live there peacefully and then got destroyed by the humans (aka muggles) and the villages have weird architecture and it will have few loots like ( spell books, magic wands, etc.)
Yooooo can you add an jungle village please
U have 200k likes sooo do pt 2????
You honestly should work with Grian.
It look like a game of Settlers of Catan.
warcraft 0-0, and the limenade outro song........ i really love the limenade outro song.
best minecraft creative content on youtube
will this map be downloadable? 😳
I want that seed
A
Wooooowwww
204k likes now wheres the link?
How do we play on this map?
This is an incredible build on its own. And your gonna upgrade and develop it even more?! Your patience and creativity knows no bounds. Hats off to you sir. And I would like to recommend adding buried and frozen skeletons of possible prehistoric mobs
PLEASE MAKE MORE!!!!
idk why i thought of this but i felt happy when he made the houses for the villagers better it just made me happy to see villagers have a better home.
Will the download work on bedrock edition?
Am i the only one who is slightly irritated by the lack of a blacksmith… Great build nonetheless 👍
Idea : build a castle on the Mountain  :)
Yo fr tho at the end of this you should put all of the progress videos into 1 video cuz this shit looks sick. Also, I love Breath of the wild so theming the plains off of that gets a bit fat 10 from me
Can you plz make this map for bedrock too???
Is it possible to download the world so we viewers could explore it?
Now we're all just waiting till Mr Beast does a hide n seek with this world/map 😳
Put RLcraft VR in it and you got one hell of a good map (or just put RLcraft if you dont have VR)
It would be cool if you could get a modded or someone with good command block skills to give villagers the ability to trade with each other and actually use the marketplace
I wanna see Themyscira in minecraft
Make the jungle template a jungle palace
My main feedback is to try and keep the world still functional for vanilla survival. The structures should still spawn mobs like they normally do, underground should look similar to vanilla, and there should still be large spaces for the player to build themselves. It would also be neat to rebuild some nether and end structures a little.
i have no choice but to sub for this mans insane skill. keep up the good work :)
Mojang should really be taking notes right now
I would love to do this but there are a couple things idk first idk how to make a map like that second I suck at world edit third I'm bad at building
It's really ducking cool how there are huge open spaces on the plains. It feels much more realistic that it would take some time to travel to the other end of it, not just a few minutes at most. Although I don't think my (my dad's i guess, but my whole family uses it) PC could handle the render distance
Since in the beginning you said that "the neather leaking into the overload" you should make some neather stuff or at least just like a bastion
I'm not sure if he noted on ot or not, but putting some coal or iron into the plains boulders would be a nice touch
You are amazing, your builds are amazing, this map looks amazing, and YouTube recommended is amazing for bringing me here!
Wishing that I had a strong enough computer to download the maps you make.😭
I WISH I could built this well xD
You should also build some custom stuff like better houses maybe get some one to get s texture pack for the map
With the amount of work you have put into this it must of taken a very long time to complete so far. you have peaked my interest so I subscribed to see what else your capable of doing, excellent work you can take pride in this
You should build a new woodland mansion but better
You should also make a end and neather if you can idk if that will be to much cuz you know those are 2 more dimensions
Is it just me or anyone else want Trixyblox vs Jeracraft build battle?
I wish minecraft was this noice
So... Are you going to upgrade the Nether and the End for this one, too?
Nice, just gonna wait till part 2
Now.
epicness
This looks so incredible so far!! Will you be touching the underground at all? Like redesiging spawner dungeons/strongholds or even creating your own massive dungeon?
Idea, make diarys for pillagers, and zombies
slightly reminds me of ark ngl
Make a small post for stone golems that would be great  Like a stone golem on each of the four directions And having a larger medieval city in one of the biome would be great
"80,000 likes for Part 2" Bud...I think it's a bit over 80,000...😅😅😅
Damn bro I wish I knew how to do that
Could we get a download of the worldpainter version before it has buildings? I think it would be really cool if we could see what others build on the map
pog
So cool
Cant wait for this to be able to be downloaded
I don't know if it would fit in but maybe like a Hobbit village maybe.
This reminds me of the just cause 4 map
Cool hope you have a good day and when you go to bed you have a cold Pillow
Am I the only one wondering how to get a world download?
You should make white run and dragon reach from Skyrim
Add a giant plains biome giant oak tree
My goodness it’s time to sub
0:24 I didn't know that was possible even with an auto client thing....
Idk why but this reminded me of the Land of Ooo from Adventure time
as soon as this is up for download I'm gonna ask my friends if we can do a group survival thing in this
one builder to another that is insane
This reminds me of BOTW map! Keep up the good work~
Plains Biome: Medieval Theme
This is amazing I subbed
PART 2 NOW pls 🥺
This is amazing!
How about add different kingdoms each biome or at least 3 of them and make it where they would have diplomatic relations and trade stuff
This thing, with the right mods, could be literally, a complete new and amazing game  (Sorry if is something wrong, english is not my first idiom)
I don't easily like and subscribe, but for this amount of effort I will. I'm super excited to play on this world when it's ready!
wow
Amazing as always   Portal is amazing, pillager outpost incredible and village is so special too   but my concern is that this village is so dense but Vanilla ones are so scattered (or they look scattered because of small their small houses but these ones are big too so give a bit space between them).this is also good but i want to say that can you please add some space between the houses and make it less dense.  But oh god this was amazing, i have no words even i cannot build this
Is he redoing the caves too?  That would be awesome!!!!
dang I thought grian was the only good builder on YouTube dang
You should transform the dream smp
I really appreciate someone like you making a "player-scale" project, I personally really enjoy making player-scale builds more than large scale ones because they're easier to enjoy in survival
The pillager outpost he built reminds me of the forts in Skyrim that are always filled with bandits
I was eating a cookies 'n' cream hershey's bar, and a cookie chip flew into my eye.
Where's the swamp
i think that a large sandworm skeleton would be a cool addition to the desert perhaps with a large excavation machine lifting large parts of the skeleton into the sky...
I can't wait to try this map out
Make a boss for each biome
What your doing in these videos are amazing and I love your work! Do you think your also going to the nether? Or even the end??? (P.s. your so cool! ✨)
Haha now people will think twice breaking that tree and looting from villages
... no swamp? :O
How do you create a custom world like this?
U should make special cave and like dungeon Hope u add this 👍
Oooooooo you should add a GLORIOUS flower field!
I so want to play this map
I couldn’t make this in a million years
Man will u release this world for bedrock edition too? please
Can you please make a genshin impact world on minecraft....
I would love a Spyro reference :)
THIS LOOK SO COOL
Can i download this map?
That makes my day dude you are extremely talented I wish I could do that and I hope you do more with this I personally love art but absolutely suck at it lol I hope you do more things like this you truly deserve a sub
Okay but, WOW
you should add some type of progression system that would be awsome
7:52 I would happy live in that house I don't know how to build really well😫
Will this be a pack on Minecraft because I play on a ps4. Well I hope...
It's beautiful, I've looked at it for five hours now
Can you send me the map after you complete it, i want to do a 100 days in it. Thank you
80000 likes? More like 200k GG dude
You should have made the stair case a little broken in ruind portal it would have looken cooler
world download??? pls
Wheres the abandoned village?
What about hidden loot around and underground the island and a cave area underneath the island
Can iget link to the world u created
I can imagine this as it’s own video game
Add castle that wages war to each pther. Like orc human elves and more
it looks like a parrot. 🤔
Can you makr a sky kingdom and dragon attacking it the dragons belongs to the underground kingdom
You should put chests with items at structures so the player will have more motivation to explore
Put a cave in the traiga with a fox monument
Wish I could get this on bedrock😂
Hay trixy! I'm kinda new to the channel and I'm loving everything so far! Your builds are nothing that I've seen before! (Well maybe cuz I didn't play minecraft in a while-) I just wanted to say I love your content! Also just a little suggestion or idea maybe? Is it possible that you can make berk? From you know httyd, other than that I have nothing else to say- I really love your videos! Keep it up! 😊
OMG🤯🤯
How can I play this
pls make The Shire or Bag End. Or just do something related to Lord Of The Rings or The Hobbit
Broooo I would dieee to play in this world ..... My very own survival series .... Like ... Imagine exploring while riding ur horse, and u see thisss !!! I m like sheeeesshhhh
What a good map for modern house😏
1.1 M subs, 1.1 M views
yo please make this download open to the public I really wanna try out this map
You should do a swamp Village because there is a villager texture matching the swamp
Hey is the map only for java??
Goal: 80k likes  Outcome: 200k likes  w h a t
Can you make a hermitcraft reference on the moosh island?
Maybe you can add buried statues, made of ice and stone, in the tundra biome (that's what I call the snow biomes). Now, what I mean by that is make a few statues around the area, as if they were once part of a frozen kingdom, but later on got buried in the snow and ice. The kingdoms would have been destroyed, but the statues just remain. I actually got this idea from the ruined nether potrals, how they can end up being buried, but are broken and busted, and I want to see the same with the statues, only without the fire and such. The reason why I suggested something for the tundra biome is because they're actually my favorite biome in the game. They just makes me feel very calm when I'm actually in one.
already at 80k likes sooo whens the next vid         I know it takes massive amounts of time Im just excited
Far off in the distance, (where the wandering trader comes from) is a massive city of gold and stuff with a massive archivist library and stuff. that could be a cool reward and surprise for those willing to stray from the island
You only having eyelashes on one eye is freaking me out
80K likes...
I suggest you do a broken bridge to the mushroom biome
I wish there would be a swamp
Cant wait for the badlands
His voice is so relaxing c:
Maybe a Pride Rock with a parrot trapped in a skeleton cage, as well as a nook for a blacksmith in some other villages. Could also consider a small city, two to 3 buildings partially underground with a small strip of road and maybe an overturned car. Looks amazing! :p
I believe people in the plain have animal
what a Bloody Legend!!
do a playthrough on it
I really want to play this map
You should make a huge tree that could be used by a witch or a different mob
Wow man pretty epic mate      I wish mojang add this XD
wanna know whats good to add? well G U N S , any game with G U N S is not only american but also good so take my tip and add G U N S                 (for those who dont understand or offended by the american part its a joke)
I thought I saw this on reddit? Did someone take your image or was that you?
Minecraft dev team needs to take some notes from you good sir
Don't know why this was recommended to me, I haven't played Minecraft in months, but this got me back into Minecraft. Thank you
I was the 200,00th like
Could you build a fairy tea party in a forest somewhere? Or maybe like the Alice in wonderland type tea part?
Imagine if they used this map and made another Minecraft: Story Mode
Add helpful animal companion and underground bunkers
Make some ice spikes or icebergs outside the snow biome in the water!! Some sort of kraken maybe ?
holy crap, this is insane!
Please make it in mc bedrock I want it
This map can be a battleroyale
Soo REALISTIC WOW
In the jungle book u should ad a hidden ancient alien civilization build with a futuristic but parishes look
can we download this map?
you earned a subscription
This is breath-of-the-wild-taking
Your builds are so amazing
Maybe a literal 1 by 1 piece of snow that you fall through into a little room that has a sign saying hello
Can i have this map to play?
New sub
For the desert you should make custom cactuses and custom dead bushes
be a great rp map
80k goal, 200k at the time of this comment
It would be really cool if the village could give you a quest to eliminate the pilliger outpost, there could be like a leader you have to take out, and when the leader dies the outpost would change into a broken state or something, and the main tower could fall into the water nearby, this most likely won't happen, but that would be awesome
Lmm
Why does he always start world edits by placing sand?
THIS IS INSANEEEE DUDEEEE
Part 2 ???
Wow trixy even I can't build this
The chances of you answering me are slim, but, what do you plan to do with the caves?
you'd think Mojang would go "hey these people have some talent let's see what they got to make our game more beautiful"
bro.... the end cities are going to be fucking amazing
Minecraft should hire TrixyBlox i mean Trixy's Structures is much more better
Please make it Available for bedrock
Try a nether kingdom
How...
How 2 download
Reminds me of Oregon and our bipolar wheather
I see they’ve released this year’s Catan board game theme.
so its minecraft but with a pokemon mindset
Hi
Hey I have a suggestion. I’ve always wonder why other builds didn’t think of this but what if you created a survival map with all you creations in it. That would be so cool
For your hard work you deserve more than 1 million subs....!!!!!
Mojang, hire him rn
Me who plays botw and can prove he is right about the trees: :D
This so cool I can't wait to play the map
can u add the  world download
80k likes ? You diserve 800k
Wish I could build like that
Oh my gosh it’s at 80,000 likes I can’t wait to play this
you should add a wampa cave (from Star Wars if you didnt know) in the snowy mountains biome
Yeeees
i think maybe you should make some sort of convoy that goes from one village to the other transporting resources and other materials through the various biomes
The Island looks like Voya Nui
Wish i had java edition
what you could do is have lore behind the island’s creation, have some like mythical god have created it and separate gods created the biomes
Maybe desert should have a type of ancient egypt feel,
you should transform the nether and end as well on this map really with just a custom nether fortress and bastion and a custom dragon fighting arena  nothing else matters lets be real
canu do a nether to
I wish i can have this all
This should be Fortnite Chapter 3 mao
Deep underwater cave systems with stalagmites and a large central tree surrounded by magic would be quite interesting
THIS IS AMAZING
It looks like the island in tensura WN side story
Make boss mobs we can fight and have great rewards
Underground giant mysterious portal with secrets to another mystical world that you explore
th is beautiful i wish i had your talent of imagination
It'd be cool to create different places of worship in each biome. Maybe a Buddhist temple in the ice plains or a mosque in the desert biome
you don't deserver 1m subs, you deserve 100m
Can I downloud that?
Happy 1mil 😄 🤗
He should be a Minecraft designer
I hope minecraft hires you to make maps like this because the original maps are so boring
Idk who youd need to work with to make this happen but you should find a good coder/mod maker and make a mod that improves world generation. Not necessarily structures but like cliffs hills natural water structures etc
I don’t know how you do it I would be a perfectionist
You should totally make a series of this
I saw a among us character on the thumbnail
This is absolutely incredible!, cant wait to try it out :D
Easter egg suggestions: Underwater kraken Flying Phoenix Unicorn in Forrest Dragon guarding a pile of gold deep in the mountains A blue centaur under a waterfall (from cartoon Hercules) Minotaur in a maze
I wanna see more... ASAP🙏🙏😂
This looks AWSOME!!
this is cool yo!
This looks insane as hell. This is lore gold
Can bedrock play this too?
The map already looks better than anything
181k likes Where's the map!? I wanna play!
Best I have seen from this channel do far. Insanely cool
I NEED THIS DOWNLOAD, IT SO AWSOME
the dislikes are people jealous
The start looks like lego bionicols
This would make a great map for a MMO, RPG game
Fast speed build be like:IM A FLY
Where can I get the map
Are you gonna build a stronghold?
You should add a Upgraded Dungeon Type thing with some boss at the end to the Small island.
will there be custom caves or something of the sort underground because that would be really fun to explore and mine. also what about the nether and end?
This is a nice build so far. I'd personally like to see the desert be built next with pyramids,sphynx's(?) And other Egyptian style builds
ayo i think i saw this on r/minecraft or smth
I wish he was a designer of minecraft to make minecraft most best game in the universe.
This guy is so underrated  .Pure talent 👌💗
wow. amazing. earned you a sub and a like
So i am here to ask that  We dont know how much days you took for it to build beyond our imagination but still we are not watching the whole video thats really depressing  Plz guys share his videos thats alot of hardwork like we cant even make a house for us in mc becuz of bored and he made the whole mc world with all biomes 😍😍😍😍
I kind of wish this was actual world generation
this map is going to be insane when its done.
why cant mojang hire this guy, its so good
I can sense 100 days youtubers using this map after its done
I already see forge labs making a 100 days on this
That was amazing.
Simple building style.... Anyone else triggered by that?
you should add some bee hive in some trees
Master builder 🤯🤯
only a few minutes into the video and im getting breath of the wild vibes
Ufo
Can you play it on bedrock?
This channel will blow up when mr beast plays it
this would go awesome with tango teks upgraded villager mod an his other stuff it would be beutiful cant wait till i can download the world
Hands down this is about to be one of the most inspiring Minecraft series to ever come out. Keep up the amazing work!
What about the strong hold revins and abandon mines
So some things to add  1. Maybe in certain places you could elevate the ground to a drastic extent and then have a sharp cliff, and going along with that, some ravines  2. I feel like there should be more rivers lakes, and streams. It just doesn't feel right tbh  3. Yeah so you know those old transformation structure you made? (Eg, the end stronghold upgrad and desert pyramid upgrade) maybe you could copy and paste those structures into the world and add a little civilization area to give it some legend-telling  4. Since you're taking inspiration from botw, maybe you could add a large castle and a castle town  5. I think maybe the mushroom island is a little too close to the main land. Give it a little more distant. Oh, and since we're on the topic, you shiuld add some islands here and there around the perimiter of the landscape  6. Ok this is a realy good one. Maybe you could also give the nether/end an upgrade too. Give the nether a netherite kingdom, and turn the end into a place of exile. Maybe there's a reward for conqering these dimensions, like a certain weapon to end all weappns ; )   All in all, i do hope you incorporate these into the map and i can't wait to see what the final product will look like  Stay safe!
I ant wait for the next episode/vid
how do I play this when its done
Can you also give us the base template (Basically the world before you made changes) as well
me about to seriously ask "where world download?!"   *checks the date*  ooooh...
can you make a broken bridge between mushroom island and forest
I thought you work in Varuna
I wish my favorite structure was in there The Woodland Mansion
U CANT WAIT FOR THIS MAP TO BE DONE! I really want to play it!
i dont even play minecraft, but i might just have to buy it to play this map
I hope you include secret island
Build a haunted house in the snowy biome
200k nice
I'm literally crying watching u make this as i am the opposite of doing something this amazing.
Underground ancient temple
Is this a world that is open to the public
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESHHHHHH
It would be cool if you hid obsidian blocks in each village through the map for you to find and bring back to the portal
Isn’t that as wide as the farlands
Bruh
Can you give us the world code so we can play make it on ps 4 or 5 nin switch xbox and pc oh and creative plz
I liked this
If it’s not too late, I thought it could be cool to see some sort of underground shrine, similar to hidden palace zone from sonic and knuckles, maybe it could have a partially built wither at the centre of the temple on an altar with a block built prophecy on the wall behind it, it could be located In the jungle maybe. Just thought that might be cool.  Thanks
Will this be able to download and free? And be ported to MCPE? I would love that you have no idea. This looks amazing and you are so talented
First of your videos i've seen, so i cant say i was here before 1m, but I'm excited to be here now!! Super hyped for the rest of this map!
This is incredible work i am truly impressed i wish you the best and hope you continue this is crazy creative and simple a great idea i truly hope i get to play this map
Make some pools around the larger clusters of boulders   Also this is a great video
Make a bit of the desert be on a lower Block level as id there was a lake. You can add bots, a town with a port that is no longer in use and maybe something resembeling bones of some kind of a Monster.
This would be perfect for an RPG style SMP
i like trains
This fell like 2b2t
If youve watched attack on titan you'll know more of what I'm talking about, but can you add the village with the wall that would be epic thank you!
where can i get the world it doesnt say
A secret I recommend is a large, hidden, fiery throne room with a Herobrine statue on each side of the throne.
I think having something like Stonehenge on the mushroom island could be cool
You should add a lot more structures that are a bit smaller. I think that would fit vanilla more.
Looks like a hunger games arena
Huge fossil please!
Where's the blacksmith
A castle would be cool
So Cool!
Finally i can pretend to be in the land of Ooo
We need a download of this world
THIS IS SO COOL MINECRAFT NEEDS TO ADD THESE
In the desert you should make a small town where the wandering travelers are from!
Yeah this is really cool but your custom oak trees... idk. From a survival stand point they might be "worse" then the original ones. Sure they have more wood, which is good. However you put slabs and the logs with no bark. Some people might like that, and sure they look good but you can't build a crafting table out of both those items and usaly they are for building a base. Not everyone uses them also so from my pov in a survival gamemode they are just more clutter
Such a good video man keep it up
“minor details” (to the library) Me who can’t make a normal village library
What you could do in the the snowy biome you could somewhat base off of skyrim in a sense and make a lumber mill that could create little trade routes around the map that trade spruce wood that would explain how the plains biome got spruce wood. Which could then allow for pilligers raiding the wood wagons for supplies for their camps
It would be awesome if there was a main story in the world making it an adventure map that can also serve as a survival world adventure map with its very own lore and side quests, but i imagine it would be very hard to do it considering youre a one man team doing all of this
for the tundra village you should add an ice cave for mining ice
Man now i rly want to wait and make the ender scrolls on this map! It already looks amazing!
This is amazing! Inspiring even! Do you plan to update it with caves and cliffs and stuff when the next update is out too?
What Mc should me like LOL
IDEA: In on of the biomes, build a secret lab that shows how the zombie village became a zombie village.
Bro you are litttttttt ! 😎😎😎😍😀😁😁😜😜😻
You should try to do something with an abandoned well found near desert villages
Shouldnt a map of this size have at least 2 separate villages in each biome?
You should make a little mod pack that changes all the vinnilla structures
Hope this is what minecraft looks like when it gets v.2.0
PLS is it gonna be on ps4 or console
Plz make the other biomes!!
10mil block tall bob ross statue
Shrek.      Add shrek somewhere.
Suggestion: Small runes could be scattered across the map, by completing the puzzles inside them you could gain a special item. Maybe something to do with the story. Keep up the good work it’s amazing!
1.1 M subs. 1.1M likes. Seems as if all agree this should be finished!
Mojang needs to hire you
u sound like Tommyinnt
This is just pure talent
Suggestion:  Instead of just 1 Pillager outpost you could add some Pillager camps, not big camps just small enough to house 2-3 Pillagers basically a Pillager bandit camp or vice versa where travelling villagers set up camp to rest, just to make the world slightly more alive
Virgin
Nice build
You legit stole my idea. But cool
put a rick roll in there somewhere
Dude makin this when i can't make a half decent castle
So cool!!!
Just wow,”, omg
add sirinhaed
This is what I’ve been waiting for sense I’ve become a patron member just for your content
Your so good at building
Yeti/Bigfoot den?
Everyone gangsta till Mojang adds these structures
I'm so excited to see the nether :-) :-) :-)
EVEN IF YOU DONT LIKE HIS BUILDS YOU HAVE TO LIKE HIS VIDS HE WORKS SO HARD AND DESERVES RESPECT ✊🏾
WOW you are such an amazing builder, I took a few screenshots so I can try some of your ideas.  Thank you for that awesome vids, you have a new sub :)
My favourite has to be the villager outpost
So coool!! I’ll be excited and waiting patiently no matter what biome you do next 😄
So...are you going to open the portal and update the Nether too? Can you even do that to the whole thing?
I think there should a underground ruined base in one biome
Next video: Remaking the entirety of Minecraft
I cant wait to download this map
We need to get to the end pls
Why tf he have no eyelashes
Amogus island
Mojang will gonna be so happy!😊😊😊😊😊😊
Like goal: 80k 2 days later: 195k Hmmmmm maybe he gave us to much tome
this is amazing! please do another video of making this world!
Is there going to be a part 2 I hope there's going to be a part 2 because you have a good taste of detailing and upgrading everything in Minecraft so I called you amazing and awesome
I think it would be cool if you did custom caves in this world. Even an underwater city would be cool too
POV: he had help, because of spectator mode = another player
Ok hear me out make a castle in the olanes wich is a OP massive vilage
This is mesmerizingly awesome to watch
Try building lady dimitriscu's castle
Wish I could play this on bedrock
I have a suggestion for you Jungle biome😄 In my country or Malaysia🇲🇾,there is a tradisional house called ‘Rumah Panjang’ where all the villagers will gather if there was an event,dead person,and more…its more like a community center.You can go search the house in Google
Make a upgraded nether fortress
Now there’s a 0% chance that he’s gonna ever see this but this may have been the greatest idea that you could’ve added which was that far away from the island there’s like a secret island there’s like it’s full of blue like it is like monsters like it’s a secret lab like there’s a small island and there’s a door until secret lab underground that can lead to all of the biomes in all their main places so it’s like a Tavern to all of the places
I want to visit this world 0-0
That is amazing!
You should do a ginormous jungle tree in the jungle biome. Love your work anyway :)
where world down load
This needs to be an update
amogus island
Basically Wano kuni on minecraft
I can not wait to see the next video.
EPIC  MINECRAFT       GAMER!!!!
You lied to me, you didn’t upgrade the blocks
Love the vid but yu should've expanded the village a little adding a few pedestrian houses
Op
I've got an idea. A huge UFO underwater, gta style
You should make all the biomes and then play that world as a survival series
Could you possibly make Ba Sing Se from Avatar the last Airbender
Put a dragon nest and a dragon boss for boss fight
Are you the guy who posted the Reddit post?
someone should make a mod pack for this map
Suggestion: you should take steps to make the villages more trade accessible, ex: make counters to restrict the trade villagers so they act more like NPCs in rpgs and can be tracked down to trade with, personally I think it would be annoying to look for the oak village to get to the cleric and then have to play a game of hide and seek to get my stuff
I want some dragons that you can tame in every biome in each caves it will have 10 tiers but i have no pc so im just gonna watch
you should base the mesa biome off of new austin from red dead redemption 2
Make each fishing spot have a sign that shows which fish you can catch there
Now...upgrade the air...
Recommend gang!
I subbed do I deserve a cookie
Please please please add a woodland mansion, I’d love to see exactly what you would do with it to make it look both more frightening and more monumental
Sheeeeeeeesh
Subscribers: 1.1M Views: 1.1M Me: Now That's What I Call, Pwetty Epic
Also this be fire 🔥
The size of a chearch in a town in the old days showed how sinfull the pop was the big the more sin as they tryed to buy there way back in to gods good book
I'm near sighted so I can't watch this video from, a far 😥🐗🦥🦩☄️
10/10 that was nuts
I think it would be awesome for a underground structure which might be good like a mining outpost or a mineshaft but upgraded etc.
you should build a hoth battle diorama in the snow biome
you should make a witches tower in the forest, like something out of hansel and gretel !!
make the end as part of an alien spaceship
I would add an underground village that might be a nice touch on the mushroom island or tundra areas.
@Minecraft start taking notes and add these in 1.18
It is codm map
Oh my god I am so excited! You better finish this and let us play it! Within 2 days we’ve passed the like goal! We’re so excited!
Where can I download:(
Boring
this is epic..
This is incredible. Can't wait to see the rest of it
Can u make this for MCBE
I already love the designs goodjob this is amazing
Zootopia
when is mojang gunna hire this man
can i stream with this world?
Do a woodland mansion, nether upgrade, improved caves and improved end
*I want the Bob Ross*
I had to subscribe just to see where he takes this world.  The transform so far is amazing!
You've just got to include some Breath Of The Wild references, like a super OP diamond sword in the dark forest.
no this is not minecraft this is wano kuni
Will you ever send out a code where people can check this out?
This is.... so exciting. Please don’t get burnout! It’s important and a big part of failing big projects. Can’t wait to play :)
Can we download that map i want to play that map on mobile :)  Edit: i think mobile can't load that map haha
Just tried double like
Bruh what the hell is that I wish my brain worked like that this my man really thought of a campfire like that with a red block man I could never 7:05
I want to download it but I'm on minecraft pe I subbed aswell
Dude iwish I can get this world on pe
This is so amazing! Great story telling as well! I love this video so much and am excited to see what comes of it! You earned a sub!
Sadly,now is to late, but u could consider use "create" to create more vivid villages (mills that actually move for example)  But in any case, an amazing job
I hope I can play this on bedrock 🥺
Ice cave with a frozen UFO being excavated.... maybe?
Trixy pls make avaliable In Java and Bedrock/MCPE edition
I’m glad that I clicked on this video
Can you add custom loot chests or vanilla loot chests and stuff for the custom structures?
omc imagine finding this island just randomly searching the ocean lol
I am definitely stealing that anvil from the stone mason
Is there a seed so can other people play the world?
You should do the desert next!
I can’t wait to play this this summer
This man needs to be in hermitcraft
god Dam
I wan't to play it ... But my pc is going to die
do a nether themed biom
As I don’t play Java, I’m wondering if there is a bedrock link (specifically pocket edition)
add a castle plz
Bruh, you’re the best builder I’ve ever seen
dude this looks so cool, and maybe you could do some kind of castles there one of my favorite things to build in minecraft.
Quick question, was there a treasure box for the ruined portal? Love the build, and I can't wait to go ahead and start playing on the finished build with friends!!!!!
This is amazing and I want more. Please give me and all your subs more of this amzing content
Sadge,Its on java 😔
First time watching one of your videos. My cat really enjoyed your voice, so i guess i’ll keep watching
The map really reminds me of Wano from one piece not sure if he was inspired by that
indiana jones do it IT WILL BE SO NICE
this guy should be working for mojang
I think that you already thought of this but adding a hidden tomb somewhere would be pretty sick
For the snowy Mountains secret I'd say something so rare, so incredibly rare that no man has ever seen it before.  An honest politician.
This is awesome
Mojang needs to hire ppl like you to make Minecraft worlds look more like this and more naturally love the work you do
Thats almost as big as the whole minecraft world!
This is super cool and very creative! Even if I can’t play it personally, I still love watching!
I literally can’t wait
I know this ain't related to building. But maybe u can script or makes someone else to script a mod for the ice mountain monster. That'll be littt😋😋
Ya quiero jugarlo
Ok
Everything about this is epic
Definitely place a mansion for the illagers in this world. I'd like to see what you would do for it.
This is mind blowing🤯
mojang needs to hire this man ASAP
Minecraft needs to hire this guy
someone needs to make a mod that like makes mine craft more realistic (not rl realistic actually realistic) just to play this map lol
It's like an isekai world  It's an anime genre that transfer the MC to another world after they die
Amazing
This is literally the best minecraft related video I've ever seen
Maybe add in a giant monument that people worship that connects to all environments. You could also add in a little town around it. Or it could just be a myth like the giant mountain in lord of the ring. Maybe you could add in something like Mount Rushmore in America
Is it possible to play that in bedrock eeition
1.17 update but better
you should get a mod thats for a cool boss battel and hide its under grownd and some orther mini bosses
This was so inspirational!!
0:00 SUS 😳
No normal mountain biome, just snowy :(
Can i used this world?
Add some Create mod stuff to the map!!! The train, windmill and such would be much cooler with the mod.
This guy is a legend
6:53 it said dummies you dummy...... well I mean thats kinda right.
Maybe make a sort of abandoned village in taiga and then a diary entry from a traveller in an outpost that mentions "a great beast of giant proportions that the villagers fear" and then you go on a quest to find the monster then once you complete the quest, you fight in the monster's lair.
could you also link a download for the base map?
i wonder whos a better builder trixy or jare craft
i just discovered your channel and its awesome, just liked and subbed!!
Imagine speed running this seed be like:it's fake
how do i get da map
Man can i download the map?
A really cool idea for the plains would be a Stonehenge circle for some more decoration
How would I mine though?
totally playing this map in vr
Mods!! Lots and lots of Mods
what about the swamp
This is incredible! I'm so excited to see the rest of it!
Two kinds of people: those who know what sand looks like, and those that think it's white
If its survival friendly, I'd really like to see you create an end realm that really feels suiting for a final boss fight, bc i've always felt the end was very lack luster for being the game last realm you are meant to go to. Also, i really like the effort you put into these things, its pretty inspiring to be honesy. Thanks
Inserts kylo ten more gif
minecraft designers writing ideas rn
noice
Add a swamp please
Nice video !!
Make a bob ross tresure quest
I wish minecraft did stuff like how you do it but unfortunately they dont do it but this is COOL
I wish I could like this more than once 😪
this is dope!! hyped to see the other biomes
*sees the floating anvil in the quarry* wait that's illegal!  honestly though, this build looks _amazing_ and i can't wait to see what else you have planned for it
i literally don't know what to say but that world is Incredible :D
...You might've reached 80,000 likes.
dont forget caves and clifs and the past updates and keep the map updtaed for as long as you can like update every 2 years or 1 year maybe
You should make it for bedrock as well
I definitely need to see where this is going!
Will this be for bedrock and Java
it wood be soo cool if you combine all your minecraft worlds into 1 hugh world like every video on your chanel in 1 world be soo epic
Brush teeth not tryin to be mean
Which version would this be available on? Java or bedrock?
Guys just imagine if there was a mod that made this world into a story mode and after you complete it you can make your Own story. If that was a thing I will be up for it
U can a make cave in mushroom island like ppl in plains believe there is a monster and only brave villagers can go
This build can be a DnD world
Yo u ar an amazing builder
well dont forget to upgrade everything in the end and nether maybe in the sky and under the ground
a villager and pillager castle, 1 should be in the winter biome
Where is the world download
If there were mods so  the cleric cart could actually move this map would be fire.
is there a world download?
great build though i think it would be cool if there where ocean biomes and the little tiny like sunken castles if this does become a map i hink you should make it for bed rock and java its only fair
It'd be kinda cool if you made the mushroom island into a replica of Easter Island. Also love the work keep it up and I'm definitely subscribing.
If I had the the time I’d love to make a world comparison to Hyrule
Can you please add a black smith and a bell tower? THAT WOULD BE SOO LITTT!!!! (great video)
You now I want a smp on this island
Minecraft should hire you
Idea: A castle on a floating island above the main island guarded by a fire-breathing dragon
Are there gonna be other videos on the other biomes or do we have to get the world to find out ourselves?
This Is truly a beautiful build
need more
ZELDA IS POG
Make some acual story and make the stronghold in a Serrano area wherever you want but put it in a huge cave with an end castle that is guarded by either skeletons and enfermen with skeletons and a wither at the center
imagine being good at building
You should build a whole world that is Super Mario themed.
That was awesome
Hide a book witha rickroll link somewhere
I would've lost my sanity
This is absolutely bonkers! I can’t wait for the rest of the series. I love the idea with the clerics and maybe the savannah could have a lot of nomadic tribes. People who travel in wagons around their sparse biome and act as traders from the desert and Mesa to the people in the plains. Some interesting things for survival stuff would be a ruined wagon structure, a wagon that fell behind and was left to rot with some loot in it. Or even encamped wagon trains all circled around a bonfire.
I could never get the dedication or motivation to build even one of these builds
If you thought trixx was the only one suffering through this,think about the camera man
why does the map look like a click bate fortnite map update
1st idea: What if with all the water, you have it lead to a secret area or maybe a key. You need a key from each biome to open a huge door in each biome that hold the final secrets of that biome. Let's take as an example, you start to swim inside the rivers or watery areas in each biome and find a water key in each one(they may have challenges or not, that's for you to decide) and go to the water biome with those keys (there is not a key in the water biome because that is where the door is🙃) and open it. Once done you now have access to the watery secrets. 2nd idea: What if you worked with a few modders so you can make the viligers actually trade differently or even give tasks to do so you can get closer to the main goal (if you add my idea) possibly get the location for the ancient door to the secrets or keys to the other biomes that can hold(again with if you want to add mods) have special powers or equipment.   If you want to dumb it down to make it easier for you to ACTUALLY do because I'm just letting my mind free. Have fun🙂 Love u and your amazing work💛
This is so beautiful!
In the jungle biome instead of having a church or something of that sorts you should have a medium sized stone head, and this also kinda translates to real life, because in real life There was a Tribe in Central America, to Mexico called the “Toltec’s” . Which they Didn’t worship the Heads, but I thought it would be a nice idea.
what about the nether? but other than that it looks AMAZING
Guess I'm playing in VR lmao
ADD A SEA MONSTER PLEASE
Why ja this so satisfying to watch? Oh, and happy 1 mil subs
I though of something what about every biome has landmark like a split bolder of something like that
It’s recommended to me
Idea for the snow biome: A dilapidated village of Inuits/Eskimos that had been ravaged by an avalanche.
How long did just this video take?
Luv your work
Hello, I have a pretty cool idea. What if in the mushroom biome, you add in a secret wizardry room underground, in a cave? Anyways, love your vids. You really make my day, and are a huge inspiration
Subscribing to see this project get finished
I bet u Minecraft is watching this rn and is really interested, waiting for the next update 👀
How do I download it, :)
Make an ice cave with a snowman village inside the mountains in the snowy mountains area
This boy literally recreating the elder scrolls in the cube game
Can't wait for the next biome the plains looks amazing but the thing that just kept bothering me about was there not being enough vtrees around the village
Minecraft Battle Royale anyone?
Make a Trixy SMP
OMG this is the BEST build Ive ever seen in my life! Good job!!!
You should add a blacksmith!!

Don’t forget to change how the neither and the end look when you enter the dimensions

Almost his entire subscriber count watched this video…
Lol they already like cuz they want it
When you won’t be able to play it because you’re on mobile
You are insane
That middle part of the Island is sus
The Bob Ross reference is gonna give me a chub. When I grow my fro out everyone says I look just like him. The hair is a pain though.
Imagine he adds ocean biomes lol
I don´t know why but I think that a castle would be extremely epic.
I love you bro, I can’t wait for this to finish, I really wanna play it, it looks soooooo amazing, and it’s not even done, I can’t wait to see what this turns out to be in the end 😁😁😉
every so often this video would distract me from being unhappy
I'm SOOOOOO HYPE
In the mines add a villager who lost his family to some raiders from in town or out of town don’t care but you help him take revenge over the whole raiders clan
To the 474 people who disliked this video I say to you why, just why.
11:23 Yay! Your Christian! Or are you?
My god this is fire
"80k likes" there is now 185k likes, so i think we passed that
The island from ark in Minecraft
Bedrock edition world download please :| (If it's even possible lol)
I want to play it!!!! Please continue!!! I love these videos!!!
Amahngahss
That 80k likes just got destroyed 😂
This is so cool
Don’t forget to make a neather and upgrade the end
Plz make it for moble
Make the mount ebot
looks like terraforged, but better
Why can't they just hire content creators to create their building to have a variety into it. It suck we have this ridiculous looking blocks for villages
Ayo, anyway to put it on bedrock eventually...
Lol it looks like Wano from one piece
This was delightful to watch! I usually don’t post commentaries on yt videos, but this one was a must. As a new subscriber, I was simply blow away by your skill and charisma! I didn’t even notice the minutes passing, and sat wide-mouthed during the whole video. It’s a lovely project, although I can see how much effort it will take — And so, definitely would like to see it finished! Also, congratulations on the subscribers!! Hope your channel grows way beyond that, cuz it’s what you deserve.
OMG please leave the link to download the map
Maybe add a cemetery or garden to the church, idk
Nice dude
What is the name of the program you used to create the giant island?
I'm gonna say it. He's Grian on steroids.
Little maker
Villagers dont deserve to be living this good
Yo, who wants to make a server once the map is finished and make a bunch of cool projects, like bases, castles etc?
You should make the lil mushroom island appear to be an island, but actually be something much grander underneath
The scarce kick cellularly mend because siberian feraly report lest a envious eyelash. weary, staking flavor
Rain snow on biome snow?
The perfect DnD map doesn't exi-
Imagine this map but like modified a bit with the create mod like making the windmill actually spin and other stuff
This reminds me of Breath Of The Wild
insane could you build a whole rpg map
Amazing.... everything you did was amazing 😍😍😍😍good job bro❤🔥
1.1M subscribers
Did you do leather worker
should i care he went up .2m subs while i was away for 2 hours?
How come it took YouTube this long to put your buds in my recommendations... You are my new favorites Minecraft builder
my pc is crying just from seeing this
So we can play on this map?
It looks like amogus
when you realize in the real world this world would be 146.304 kilometers long (or 90 Miles long if you are using the imperial system, so it would be about as big as south Carolina)
Can’t wait to see this finished
I would love to see some sort of Star Wars reference in the snowy biome like the head  of a atat or like the yeti cave where Luke is taken to
I really wish Minecraft was actually like this 😁.really cool vid buddy
If Minecraft used these biomes as there’s I would just implode from excitement
Arttt
Considering the portal in one of the centerpieces of the plans biome, why not make a nether hub? And if you want you could even use it as a way to show off some nether structures if you choose to making any
“ very miner changes” rebuilds whole house snd changes everything all while building better than I ever could
Epic Build! Something that I noticed you didn't include in the video is the caves (to make it survival friendly) and stronghold/structures.
Honestly the size mistake might be a blessing despite the extra work. So much potential for stories, builds, scale, etc. it looks absolutely amazing so far so thank you for all the hard work
Cool idea I had.Make your village upgrades to the mine colony mod template, I don’t actually know how it works but i think it would be cool.
dang this was insane.
You should be hired by Mojang
Do you think you could keep a download for the vanilla version of the map aswell? I’d love to create a survival and build my own stuff on your incredible island!
Who are you? 👀
I hope this map has ores so I could use it for an smp
make an underground maze/trap
Better explanation for clerics would be that they’re spreading their religion.
Is it available in bedrock ps4?
Duuude, this is literally perfect! Just want to see your upgraded version from the Swamp, I think It would fit well between the Plains and the Jungle
I REALLY want to get this downloaded world in bedrock edition please!
Man, these are so fun to watch. Thank u so much for your content. Its so enjoyable to watch
I know it could be a long shot but is it going to be bedrock compatible?
Is there such thing as builder's block? Because I think I have it and the was the cure
why is this man not a designer for mojang.
The Pillager outpost looks like a Skyrim Out post
Bruh I need it, I want it, GIVE IT TO ME
This is freaking amazing!!!!!!
"the library stays true to it's design" changes the entire building
FORTNITE MAP 3.0
Minecraft: "How big you want the church?" TrixyBlox: *"Yes"*
Is there a seed for it I would like to see it
please make a alien world, with everything based off actual biomes
Maybe a dragons lair at the peak of a mountain hidden or a yeti. And in the jungle by the coast a pirates port like tortuga in pirates of the carrebean.  Love the video so imaginative!!
Why did that wagon for the cleric remind me of the Oregon’s trail video game?
I wish she got uploaded to mcpedl for bedrock players so bad, but there's probably conversion issues
pls add the king yeti also there main enemy monsters from the nether
oo, when I get this map I'm 100% turning all the windmills into create windmills and adding a millstone into it.
This man should be hired by the Biomes o' Plenty team.
Maybe make it so that one of the biomes has a more modern village like with indrusty
Wow dude this is freakin sick (I haven even finished the vid yet either)
I may or may not have had a dream inside this world, but realistic
Please for the love of god, make this bedrock edition as well as Java.
Huge tree. Don't care the background/layout, stump or living. Huge tree good.
wow  earned a sub from me!
this is epic
Your so good, absolutely amazing builds. imagine if you made this a mod
The thumbnail got Amogussed
You forgot a flower forest. Without it, we can't get dyes. And ores, what about ores?
This INSANE
This man is doing what Iv'e always wanted to do in Minecraft. Look at Trixy man. So inspirational.
Then u need to make the nether LOL
Build a druid temple in the jungle or dark oak biome
What if you added a giant wall between two of the biomes, like in the story they had wars so they built a wall.
You should do a massive cavern with a upgraded stronghold under the plains biome
so pretty much its catan
As a suggestion, how a about building a main Majors house in every major village? It may have some readable books and a hall with villagers or wings with shelves maybe.  Great building, i will definitely play on it when its done ᕙ(  • ‿ •  )ᕗ
This island kinda sus.
this makes me think minecraft is horrible
The world gives me ghost of tsushima vibes
Does the pillager outpost naturally spawn pillagers ?
u should add boss castles
Could you rebuild berk from httyd?
Damn, this is beautiful
Beetroot: forgoten
Your should do a dark Forrest biom! Kinda a black and purple theme with any structure you want to add and a creature too if you'd like!
Now that we got over 80,000 like, GIVE US THE WORLD. btw best minecraft world ever.
Clicked "Don't recommend this channel", I hate Minecraft WTH ..stupid

Holy
this made my day better thanks alot man
Imagine speedrunning this world
"map download when this video gets 80k likes" me seeing the video 2 days later at 183k: "i think we are close"
Bro, are you using a NASA computer cause if I just loaded this build my computer will die
:o i need.... Map
this gave me so much inspiration as to how to build a village I'm making in my survival world! :D
will the worl download only be available to your patron supporters?
this mans on another level of creativity and patience
I wish I could play on this world but I play in on Xbox . 😭
Who else thought of Catan after seeing the thumbnails
He said 80,000 likes and got 100,000 more😂
Yo i saw u on reddit
Your videos are so incredible and help me get better at billd.
I want whale...
I can't describe how amazing this is, it reminds me so much of BOTW. Great job.
So how do the ores work?
What if you make a road that attaches all the separate areas. Kinda like the Silk Road?
secret chest in the snow?
Every time I see one of his videos I am just amazed
Can’t wait for the other biomes
I only just found this channel, and your talent and dedication is astounding, I wish you the best of luck with your world!
Pls put this on Minecraft marketplace
Need a download
Now i want to play on this map..
you are insaaaaane
You are a absolute madlad
When you build a house in a custom made world and the villagers houses look better than your build
Can I get the link to play on the MASSIVE world. Also this is a really cool map
Someone should make a mod pack for this map specifically.  That would he fukcing awesome
This is the BEST video ive watched in a while Thank you!
a role playing smp  on this map would be a fun with the right people
I could see this as a hypixel hub map and the ruined portal the hub portal :0
Is this world super flat only? cause if not then I would love to make  a build on this map. Also flower forest biome would be cool to add. Now that I think about it. it would be cool if you merged this build with all the other builds you have done. though I don't think its possible.
Try u make the witch hut a wizzard tower
i wish i could build as good as you
SHEEEEESH
I saw you on reddit!
I call it minegea aka Minecraft Pangea
is that a mod because i want to do a hardcore survival in my phone and pc
i'd like you to add more variations in the plains so that it would relatively be less boring. but i mean this is too good how could this be boring anyways? lmao
Can we just appreciate all that hes doing for us this is incredible I'm vary proud also I'm proud of your girl friend giveing you ideas this is so beautiful
The 'human' scale of this is actually really enchanting this is my fav build video of yours by far.
Wow can you make this for Skyblock its be amazing
This mans just made the whole fucking map for The Forest nice job man
I’ll just stick with my wooden houses, you do you
When are we gonna get the download
This man needs to go work for either  Mojang or Hypixel
@minecraft are you  blind give him a job
This was surely a lot of work. So here, take my subscribtion
This is so amazing! Very epic!
make something in the End like building a giant enderdragon!
Dude, Thats simply fantastic, cant wait to play the Full map!
This is perhaps the most beautiful piece of artwork in Minecraft I've seen, I cannot wait to see where this goes
Ok I just want to say you are such a good builder
So in the mines you can find a sign with Emmett Brown's initials on it if you mind beyond that you'll find a DeLorean like build as a reference to back to the Future part 3
Will I be able to download this on Minecraft Xbox Bedrock edition?
You should put a tardis in the wild west town making it seem like the doctor had gone back in time as a reference
This is going to blow up and for the record I was here before it did
Damn that's cool as hell, can't wait to see more.
Oh shit, is the dude who made that reddit post?
This is a little far fetch but here goes.   Maybe in like the desert which in the video shows nothing maybe like in the past there was a nuclear missle hole with cool things?   or for the snow biome a secret government facility with cool monsters.  like i said farfetched for minecraft lol
Wow!!!!
hype😍😍
From zelda breath of the Wild, i think to fill some empty space, you make ruined structures
This is absolutely INSANE I have no words.
Man builds a mansion the size so big that it nearly touches the build height and calls it 'not so much' lmao🤣
I'm so excited I love your projects!
That thing he use to create the world what is that?
Maybe create the yetus cave and maybe a Bigfoot reference
This is basically Paradis iland from SNK ❤
If World Edit wasn't real      Trixy: time for another video 😐
Can't wait for the next vid im considering subscribing
AWSOME
The useful romania tellingly steer because pajama postnatally touch without a fragile band. abortive, verdant drama
I subbed because of this video it insane
This makes me wonder why the devs don’t just hire him to make a few new structures
We need more!
Hello! I got a cool idea you could use for making this survival map! Maybe, for one of the biomes, like the Dark Forest, one with a lot of shrubbery, you could put in a really tattered village with a small hideout base underground! And with the diary idea, you could put it in the small hideout describing how a family ran away into a hideout from an ambush, and they traveled a long way, maybe they even went to the plains to escape after finding a portal! But the portal was a one time use and broke! I think that might be pretty cool
This man did more work than mojang for 11 years you should be hired by them because if we compare Minecraft to your work it's like simple garbage
This man could write an amazing book but he is a god in Minecraft instead
I'm your 1.10M sub men
Pls make an Ice dragon on top of the mountain
lol right here it sounds like someone plugged in a mouse  13:36
I am so gonna play this if it comes out
Pls do a custom nether too with custom fortress and bastion that would be so cool
I just started watching stuff on your channel here very recently and damn man these transformations and things that you're able to do are just mindblowing. Plus not only that they're incredibly satisfying to watch. Like for real for example I'm blown away at how you're able to take the bland trees that are in the game and turn them into just gorgeous looking trees that completely transform areas. All I can say is I cant wait till you show more of this. Cause it's incredible already
There are few places I'd want to isaki to but if your there hell we chilling in minecraft
Could you put a protective wall or fence around the village just so monsters don't destroy it?
Build a castle in the Taiga biome, near the mountains.
This would make an amazing smp map!!!
Can you build Atlantis please
why do the plains biome look like Lego worlds with the tree's lol
add villegers to become fighters there so boring
why am I getting heavy RDR2 feels for this buildings?
And now time to download this and actually play it
There's a lot of players that don't have gaming pc can u make this map for bedrock edition too please
first of all you are so good at building second when this is done I am gonna  add a bunch of  mods that makes  it so  much more real it will be amazing
oh I just got an idea what about in the masetta biome you could add a giant skull giant or skeleton on the map dispearse through it?
Wish you could make your own animals
Thank you for having my idea someone has complete my dream thank you
Trixy, you inspire so many people to work hard and you'll succeed. your talent shares a lot meaning.
Please make a download!
Abandoned  mansion would be cool
Heavy inspiration from BotW? Well, having a tower in every biome would be nice, but if you don’t, ill add them myself and use the waystones mod to really flesh them out.
YOU ARE A LITTERAL GOD AT THIS! I am so amazed by your building skills :0
Sheeeesh PogChamp
Your Amazing at building stuff!
I-i need the nuber for it
Now load RLCraft into it.  heh
I can't even explain how much I admire your builds and how much you inspire me.
The village reminded me of the hyrule village i also see you used alot of Breath of the wild i have completed it.
Your content is godly my man. Absolutely stunning. I'm not here to hate, but pick up a toothbrush homie. Your teeth be looking yellowish, with all due respect.
The plains biome looks like blocky Skyrim
Trixy your literally amazing! How can i download this map???
How do we download the world on xbox1
You should do something cool with the nether and the end but nothing to fancy.
Yooooo i rly want to play this map this is awsome
Remindes me of red dead redemption
You need to build an oasis in the desert. Because its just a thing you must have in any desert
Are you going to make a 2 part
dude imagine if at the end of this whole thing you extend into the nether , proximity voice chats and make it into a a online multiplayer role play server that would literally be the best!!!!!!
I really hope he puts it on Minecraft pe
I would love to see either a giant underground cavern with crystals and lots of loot or maybe an underground village. Also, cant wait for it to come out keep up with the good work
More more give us more
Wow this is amazing =) (wish I was a great builder like u)
I can’t even put into words just how insane this is
This map is like litarely made for a giant survival roleplay project
if anyone is curious with his shaders they are BSL shaders, or atleast it looks a lot like it
you should get this village TWICE as large
any way i can download the map??
Please make this available on bedrock when it’s finished!!! 😊
What was that thing that you called world painter called and were do you get it
Yoo thats soo cool
Idea: add one big pillager village / town, it’s like a pillager outpost but with more buildings and 2 - 5x bigger
What minecraft should look like
Hey trixy when would the next vid be out this is mad and i cant wait for part 2
Yo i gotta just get a tutorial on that transformed pillager outpost!
I was wondering why this only had a million views until I realized this was made 2 days ago
duuuuuudeeeeee, this looks soo fucking sick bro, cant wait to play this map, keep it going bro🤟🏿
What about the nether? Are you going to custom-create that too?
If Minecraft 2 was a thing, this would be it
I wish I was this good at building
I already want to play it and ive    Watched 2 mins of the video
Any idea when you will finish
Ma mn trixy the planes biome is amazing so I'm talking like all of ur other bluids aren't better than this 😂 but just keep up the good work hope we get the new biome soon cause I cant wait and hope u guys keeping safe from the dealy virus and peace guys👋✌

You should add a big world map at the end if this project somewhere in the map.
Mom: we have people who are bad at building at home People who are bad at building at home:
I would love to see a storyline about a legion of monsters overunning and ruining a series of villages outposts and castles of a kingdom
I will wait for a map download!
80k likes? He has 177k likes😅
This map will be awesome with the caves and cliffs update
Include an among us
I don’t know if it’s too late, but I’d really like to see a swamp get included! Maybe it could take up part of the inner coast of the jungle area.  I think you should be able to find some strange and slightly creepy structures in there. The lonely castle of some old lord driven mad by years of isolation, some tents with logs about the findings of a terrible monster... Maybe you could put the zombified village in there?  Just some ideas, loving this project so far :)
me and my friends will use this world for a nice survival series
your videos are very intertaining, and super well build
you could make a shrine to herobrine lol
The kind of survival world I'd love to play
Were the god dam finish video?
This is awesome
Add a stronghold to the world
I kinda want to wait until the series is done so I can download the map and avoid spoilers
Is this going to be free? It looks too good to be free, to be honest. Gorgeous
2 days = 178K likes make it 250K this is the best opertunity you will get 7 more hours

Could you please make the world download able?
OK thats so epic
you should of added one of those Woodlyn mansions!
Bro you just Made a New ark map
I cannot put it in words how impressive this is
You should add a dungeon in one of the biomes,you can use dark souls as an inspiration thats where I get all my medieval building ideas from
80,000 he said, hahahaha
I’d pay good money if this became default Minecraft.
you should add in a crystal cavern, not only using the new crystal like blocks from the 1.17 update, but also tons of ores and a lake in the middle of the cavern
Soo.. You gonna upgrade the nether and end stuff too?
pls make a mansion
l wish I could click like several more times! I love, love, LOVE THIS!!!!!!!
SSSHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESHHH
My guy made a better Minecraft story mode
This looks absolutely insane.

🤤
This is beautiful.
You should get hundreds of random people to play on there and have a war if you would Between the different biomes once your done
I'd love to see a recreation of the sunken ship structure in the ocean area!
World download!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I wish i could have this but im on bedrock. The limits of console...

Please do a castle! Maybe a winter Castle. And a very very old big tree
Me: I never watch a video more than 2 times Also me: I've watched this video 5 times already
Bro, I have to say it and probably most people in the comments already told you but you are one of the most talented and amazing sick people I have ever seen.  it's amazing the world you created and all the structures you made to complete it.  I'm almost sure that with the thousands of comments that you will be overwhelmed with in the comments and you will miss mine you won't read it but I would love for you to make a tower almost like the ADMINISTRATOR in "SAO" (Sword Art Online) representing that there was once a god that created the world you are exploring with the ability to do everything or something like that. I'd love to have a part of the story like that and for sure the tower/fortress/dungeon would look amazing.  completely awesome  you need more subs
Add Thor’s hammer
Can you add a playlist for this series
This is crazy
Where can I have this world ? 😭
That’s awesone
Amazing wow!😁😁😁😁👌
Your building skill deserves to be in hermitcraft
Can we have the world download, i would love to survive to play on it
I could not even begin to imagine myself making something as amazing as what you’ve done, good job
Please get working with some mod makers after this so that there could be mythical creatures, real life animals, none of that classic minecraft enemy mobs that would be fantastic
Did you Play Uncharted? If yes, you would know those old villages In the Jungle which are half Broken but you could build this one
Put secrets in the portal to
You should make the player start with a map that covers the whole map with compass so the player can know his location and the biomes and not get lost cuz the map is soo big it's really great keep it up and if you can pls make a bedrock version of it   IT'S REALLY GREAT
What is the world seed
I saw this island on Reddit
Trixy setting a like goal on 80k Him seeing 180 k likes be like : My expectations were low but holy shit
THIS IS AMAZING. I especially love the inspiration from Breath of the Wild, as it's one of my favorite games. This map feels like a whole different game. Absolutely fantastic.
Add secrets to the pillager outpost like the villagers aren’t what they seem like
Minecraft Survival Evolved
That outpost reminds me of the ones in Skyrim, they seem to be similar
Are you gonna mod this? This would be awesome with mods! I mean this would be awesome already but still!
That is one funny climate
If all realms were built like this, wars would be so fun, especially in 1.17
I really want one of the villages to have kind of a futuristic, redstone based city with actual technology
P
He is so good at this!! Definitely want to play it when he’s done. I can’t wrap my mind around how he is so good at building!! Absolutely incredible!!
this map is better than dreahmall v.2 map
Hi, I know you wont see this but I am a huge fan of a game called Red Dead Redemption 2, and I really wanna play a map of the game, for survival and roleplaying i guess. And Id LOVE you to make it, the map is fairly simple, if you need any help with like knowledge of the game and where things are, Id gladly help. Also, rdr2 is about  a group of criminal's set in 1899, they make camps around the map and they are being hunted by pinkertons, its the backstory of a character named John Marston and the first rdr was about John and how he hunted down the remaining gang members in 1912 I believe, it sounds not very cool but it features the best game protaganists in the history of games for me, his name is Arthur morgan, in chapter 1 he was a bad man, he was picked up by Dutch vanderlinde the founder of the gang, and Hosea Matthews is the co founder, and Arthur only knew what loyalty was, thats all he had, and in chapter 2 he went to go get money owed by The Downes and Mr. Downes was sick with tuberculosis, and he accidentally spit on Arthur Morgan and Arthur had got tuberculosis, and by chapter 5 its when it really had effect. At the same time Dutch was showing his TRUE colors, a deranged murder. He acted like a good leader but he was slowly being driven down into madness by Micah Bell who was a rat and worked with pinkertons. Anyway enough about the game, my discord is Blazingboy77#2669 if you have any questions. I can send you a picture of the map if you want to build it. Thanks, I love your work.
I NOT DUMMY 🙃
You should make an underground castle with zombie, skeleton, and spider jockey spawners. And it should be in the taigia biome
Can you please do a Japan 🇯🇵 style I feel like it would have a good effect on the world
you should add boss structures with bosses that have diamond, netherite armor etc and give them weapons and custom enchants if possible on their armor and weapons
Wow! Great video! I have never seen a better build in my life! I’m definitely going to download this when it is released! You are such a talented builder! And this is only the start............
Can you make it in bedrock
For console players can u make a vid of secrets in  a week or smthn?
I CANT WAIT TO SEE THE COMPLETE WORLD BRO I WANT TO PLAY IN THAT WORLD!!!

If this was how Minecraft was. Your character would probably have to be big
Question: will this map work on pe? Or will my iPad burn with the heat of a thousand suns?
Where can I get the world download
You just made my day ❤️
you should add an underground mine w jumpscares
lmao idk why kinda giving me valheim vibes
I swear if there isnt a random underground block replaced with a sign saying “Felix was here” I will die a very sad man
Pippen and trixy blox should do a villa le     Btw if you don’t know who pippen is search up building the world in line frat 1:1 scale mrveast did something with him

You know , carrot actually never planted as field , it planted as garden bed 🙃
How can i download the map?
Yoooo dude this seed would kill it
I would kill to have half the talent you do
Will the world download be available on Bedrock too? I would love to show it off to all my friends and explore the finer details!
Bro I can’t wait for the next build
Idea for the Snow biome: Make a wrecked hut on the mountain lower side, and a boulder on its side, like the hut was destroyed by a rolling boulder. Idea for the Mesa biome: Make one of the mine entrances inside the west town and make the mine have some miners on it (either villagers or pillagers, even zombies).
ok i should really watch furthur cuz u added 2/3 of the things i said
nvm i now see u added pillager outposts XD
And Ive made it to 3:00 and ive already thought of an amazing idea! MAKE A NETHER PERFECT WORLD THING. u prob wont read but i did it anyway. I was also thinking about adding jungle temples and Pillager Outposts and off the coast of the snowy mountains could be a really cool ice spikes thing. u do u! I will probably comment after so stay tuned!
I NEED part 2
at 2:20 biomes look amazing!!
Yooo put the Aurora (from Subnautica) in the ocean
Idk man but if you got time you COULD make a few or a single floating island would look cool just saying
You gave me a cool idea this map is used for normal survival gameplay how about a map like this one but for the origin mod
Adventure time feels
Add a mystery sign somewhere on the map but don’t tell us where it is
Give me more
Wait your last upload was 3 weeks ago did it take you 3 weeeks to build this huge map thats impressive that's great dedication it will take me 11 months to build that whole thing
This is amazing! Plz mak part 2
What about a boneyard in the desert biome?
Chinese structures Sakura trees
trixy: please can we get 80k on this vid?  trixy when he realises that it has 174k likes:what how
New sub
Pls add hell
I love how almost all of his fans watch his videos. It's so great to see an active community!
Realy nice video 👍😁👍
how do you make biomes and spawn chunks in custom map?

Idea: Custom texture pack specifically for this world!
I think add another staircase for the ruined portal just for convenience
0:00 Amogus
Please do take care of yourself and dont overwork. We still need your future content T_T. Super excited about this.
In the mesa, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, add the "c o m e b a c k s h a n e" from the town with no name as a meme please.
can i download this map its so cool and I would want to see it in person!
Could you like try to make a version of blackreach only accesible by a mine or a secret in the mountains?
you should make this into a multiplayer server so people can go into the map with like 75 other players and battle it out to see who wins (but remember u will have to add a border so the game wont go on forever)
Can I play this in Survival?
How do you play map
Will we can dowload this map ?
i kinda wanna see a castle on the mooshroom island and little sprial steps off the cliff side that goes up to the island that would be kinda cool
This gives elder scrolls vibes to me.
this is truly awesome i cant wait to try this out
Can we download this map?
You are such a GOAT
why all best builders at Minecraft are speaking British accent?
Dude, that's Hytale
put this in bedrock NOW!
you should do the taj mahal that would be interesting. i once did that with quartz.
I am in love with this map. Always been looking for a map like this. Ty for making it
Many references...   Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Sea of Thieves, Ghost of Tsushima, One Piece Wano Arc, Assassins Creed, and kinda looks like the Kirby village ngl
You should ad a dragons nest on the top of the mountions
this is truly amazing
Will this be on the market place?
This has been what I've always wanted in a Minecraft map since forever. I am so excited for this project
Maybe add a bridge to the moo shroom biom  through the pillager outpost
Everything that you build is just incredible and inhuman. You have serious talent.
this is really sick
i have an idea you can make a giant abandoned library with plant and weeds grown it with different floor level
Idea: Pillager stronghold upp in the snowy mountins partali hidden
Please put this on Minecraft bedrock for Xbox pls
Add a tree in the middle of the farm
Imagine this was actually minecraft
The amount of RAM this guy must have
Literally gorgeous
Will we have a world download
It Looks like an anime isekai world, make Names dor all the cities
You're doing better job at improving minecraft than mojang.
Are there ores in the world so its playeble in sursvival?
Meak an tepell in the dessert
You should do a survival series in this world
Ocean builds!!!
how do you get the download on ps4
so I went looking for the next part and then noticed " dang that released three days ago, he's probably still working on the second biome!!!
i think you should add a meteor or a giant hole where the meteor wouldve 'landed'and added some story to it
Please make this for bedrock (marketplace)
U are one of the best builders no 🧢  U and grian should colab

There is no such a great word to describe your builds
Make santa's home in the snow bione
This deserves a subscription 👍
I really like how you did this but wouldn't a cart fit the wandering trader better
When you finish can this be downloaded??
wow this is soooooo cool
Here some ideas For the desert biome you can take some egiptian style, and maybe featuring a sphinx close to the desert temple And this is kinda weird but For the mountains it could look like a place to live for some small creatures like goblings or something, shaping a village to smaller proportions And for the taiga you can make a single house in top of a mountain, that would be kind of cool I hope you read it, congrats on 1M and sorry for bad english, not my native language
Can you make this playable on bedrock too, I can only play bedrock
You should make a giant skull of a dragon or something in the ground
Can we download the map
Can't wait for part 2
The brash floor comparably include because mind coincidently roll about a jumbled barbara. questionable, fabulous catsup
You should do a floating future city in the air
part two
This would be Minecraft in 1.36.69
Ward
This is insane!!! Amazing job!
This is just a suggestions can you make the wild west a gold mine
You should add TangoTek's upgraded villagers mod
Is there a download?! This looks sick! (If you said there was at the end of the video I probs haven’t heard)
Is he missing his eyelashes on his right eye
many of us are waiting for it, I hope it will be available to download soon
In two days this guy got around 1 million subs
Trixy when this world is done can u make a download for both bedrock and java edition
this whole project is soooo cool, I just can't wait until I get to play it!
"I did some off camera landscaping"
Can’t wait to download this when it comes out
How do you download??
Brooooo this is amazing
add a secret bomb shelter and maybe a lab
You could add a wandering trader wagon to the market in the village. Btw very cool build I can't wait for next biomes
Is it possible there would be a bedrock version like on the store
U should save the map at certain stages as u improve
I would Love to live in such a world (irl😳😂) but Mojang should listen to you and the villager Jobs maybe the bee Guy should really bei added
Are you going to make a new temple or are you going to use the big one you have already made
Please release this as fast as humanly possible!!!
This looks like an ark map
Very good Video but 6:28 the First flag was actually right and the Second one was wrong
when the next vid coming out? u gots 80k☺️
The massive scale and massive skill, I’m speechless<3
I wish for an attack on titan build.
Can you make it so people on bedrock can enjoy your map when you release it
minecraft needs to take a year or 2 to overhall the game and get trixy blox to help
You just a legend i am impatient for your map.
What I call upgrading if it was normal minecraft Villages: 1.14 Portal ruins: working portals Shipwreck: working ship Ocean monument: pull it out of the water
Can't wait to download this map. I've liked and subscribed
I love this
Dinosaur =jungle so dinosaur
Could you add like a Witcher schooling or Witcher covin in the dark oak forest or a swampy area if you have one please
epic
maybe somewhere in the mountain biome you can make a wandering trader hut. he always seems to be wearing a robe pulling llamas behind him, and they spawn in mountain biomes. It's always a wonder where he comes from, so maybe that can add to the story or can be just a neat little secret. I for one think stumbling upon the wandering traders hut would be a cool find.
You should make a pirate base like on a underwater mountain and they are using all the space possible. Or you could make them on a barge with docks and everything they would need to survive. They could even be looting the mushroom island!
This guy: makes amazin builds: me: how did he make the anvil fly at 11:01?
Wow only one man building this sheesh imma sub
Do big City
Am I allowed to use this for a private minecraft SMP, when its released?
Include the word beans somewhere on the map like this  Beans are cool - Eco  Please?
This map, is like that food that looks so beautiful you dont want to eat because its too gorgeous
you absolutely smashed it keep on doind you amn and im exitecd for the other biomes !! 🙌😊

Trixy you must make it for bedrock too if we the bedrock viewers can download the map         Edit: i am new to bedrock and i don't know if we can download the map.Correct me in the comments if we can't downloadthe map

I’m definitely making an smp with this world
Is it possible to make bedrock version if not, I thank you for reading this comment and sorry I wasted your time
i would like to see a somewhat Norefolk like church or cathedral in maybe Taiga or Snowy Mountains biome, it would also be cool to see a viking ship that has become frozen in a ice lake 😊
Try upgrading the Nether and the End so it wont look boring and plain
Where's the download link
wow, amazing. you deserved the 1 mil :)
bro this is going to be like my first minecraft roleplaying scenario that i will be trying when it comes out super hyped
You should add the moon
Personally i think it would be cool to have a massive tree in the center of the world
Stronghold???
Could you add a wolf den? Please?
WHAT A MADLAD
A very skinny tall mountain with a boss fight
Will you be able to mine underground and are there going to be ores underground?
the map kinda looks like wano from one piece, with the mushroom island being Onigashima it even have similar rivers
what are u planning to do with the new 1.17 blocks?
yoooo this is dope
When you try to find the following videos of this series and then you realize this came out two days ago XD
I would like a way to download it on bedrock.
AMAZING!!!!!!!!
I bet he’s British
its looks like Australia map and nature :)
I'm definitely downloading this when it's available
My suggestion: KEEP BUILDING THE MAP
I feel completely inferior. I THOUGHT I was good at building. At least I know something know.... I'm useless.
One word..  Amazing
Is tier a way to port PC maps to ps4?
Add the impostor from among us
u have too much time
Get spartan weapons + shields, some form of backpack mod, and a couple other mods and you got yourself quite the adventering world. Gonna love to see this thing finished.
add an sky island and a place were the gods used to be wachting over the people who used to leave there thats my idea
Could you add a huuuuuuuuuge coral reef
Trixy, pls do a custom nether and end. It would be, well, how do I put this?  *LIFE CHANGING*
YEEEAAAH BREATH OF THE WILLLDDD!!!!
Add a graveyard next to the church with items in the graves
This guy srsly deserves all the success he gets
I can’t wait to see what he does with the blacksmith. Same with the cartographer. Maybe you could make a giant map of the biome it’s in.
2024 summer Minecraft update
mad respect for you bro. so much work went into this
Love the shaders
Cyrodil
I hope you make this playable!!!!!!!!!!!
You're wild!!!!!!!
we doubled the likes, wow we really want to play this map
Make a nether biome
pog
Cant wait to see the next transformation
I think it’d be cool if you added a witch hut to one of the biomes. I know there’s not a swamp, but I think you could still add it in the dark forest.
I CAN'T WAIT to play this!!!
This is insane and beautiful
This is actually to cool the artwork and attention to detail is atonishing
All
Please add jungle temple
uh it's over 80k likes
Hey man just wanna say.. this is really good 👍
How about an ancient underground railroad system that connect's all the biomes
wow the like goal was smashed 2 fold
This is awesome
You got my sub
You should put floating sky structures
Make a ruined civilisation in one of the biomes (idk which one but I think it could be cool)
Huh. REALLY awesome map (I’m spanish, and i’d say “apoteósico”). You can be sure i’ll download this masterpiece. And also, i think is a great map for some RPG/MMORPG server.
I think a massive tree would be cool and like have a village that lives on it
And then, the Fire Nation attacked
Will this be for everyone or just patreon
You should add a farm
I can't wait to see the full transformation of this map. Trixy, you have huge potential. I bet it will worth it in the end.
WOW JUST WOW 🤩
Can we get the map
i hope he makes a temple or structure in the mushroom biome
bruh
Congrats on 1mil. I subscribed 😝
This is amazing! Brilliant! You're so talented
your doing gods work
Trixy deserves more subs
jesus christ this looks amazing
the only suggestions I can think of are to have the railway cover more than just the desert, and to possibly have an industrial place somewhere else connected to it
I. NEED. This.
Imagine minecraft add this to the game
Trixy should be an employee at minecraft. Change my mind.
The thumbnail makes it look like a croissant
How do the villagers protect the village aka like pillagers and zombies
Ad a statue of a deity of each minecraft mineral in the center of each biome
Minecraft the RPG
pls finish this
Pls tutorijal for bulding this good
I wanna buy it already
That map is amazing, will you be releasing the fresh/vanilla version of it? I'd like to use it for my servers main map, credit would be provided if course.
I need to see the next biome this is so cool :)
Wow..... I WANT THIS!
You should add modified Dungeons that have good loot but hard to get!
Stop.please its all amogus
Bro what..
how are you manage the trees regeneration ? Anyways this is amazing your sooooo talented OOMMMGGG WUZEROIQUWZBEICWHJAFO
This is... insane...
6:53 dummies, u dummy ?!?
hey @Trixy Blox thanks for making big crop farms in your world so we don't have to steal all there crops now we can take half
Wish I could build like this guy or khaios
Idea: Maybe you can transform the Nether and End dimensions on this world. Like maybe a warped forest village and a infested Crimson biome;)
Idea for the Jungle biome: a primitive chocolate section, driven by the fascination for the cocoa that grows there. Chocolate gods and rituals? Could be fun or serious :) think shrines, symbols, etc.
For the next one you do can you try to do a massive modern castle with like a rich town around it. (If it’s not to much to ask😅.)
Mojang should learn from this video.
Dang it I can't play the map because number one I don't have a PC number two if I could play it on my Xbox it would probably break it
I have an idea where there is a pirate ship just in sight off the coast of the plains. Some diaries I there would be like: “I miss our old island... that volcano was very powerful.”
could you maybe share the seed in your next vid? these maps look awesome
can you make a vidio were you make a ender outpost kinda like the pilliger out post but in the nether
HOW IS HE SO GOOOOD!?
Maybe add an abandoned city
Mata Nui looking pretty great in Minecraft
can you make a totorial that shows how to make the pilliger upgrade place
The whole time while watching this video i was thinking this would make such a cool open world third person triple A game with like a whole story similar to breath of the wild. If you went to a group of developers you could make a really successful game from this world
That should be the actual Minecraft village ngl
Asks for 80k likes gets double
You should reupload this with no commentary and some music in the background.
Will there be an empty version of the world, without the buildings?
What computer is used to be able to render that far with shaders on? I have a 2080ti and a threadripper 2950x. Would that be enough to have a good render distance on this map with shaders?
can u put the link bc we can join on singel player
U knew what this plain need, animal, more animal
a army to fight
fortified village pls add
For 2 mil. subs you can do nether for this map :D
How much time does this man have on his hands? Please make a tutorial.
Is there a download for this map?
Idea, have a quest in mesa biome where you have to take out a evil bandit or just other quests in different biomes
if u work with like 5-10 mod developers then this would have a cool story and stuff
Is there any way to be able to make this world downloadable for others so we can see this map on our own pc
Ummmmmmmmm... fortnite??
Why is one of his eyes missing eyelashes
what about swamp?
Idk bro but the map looks kinda sus
Man, you must be an architect
When the map is released. It's only a matter of days before youtubers start doing challenged in this map
What if you added journals or logs in pillager outposts to give them a reason to hate the villagers
420 dislikes ik they arent from mad ppl its from the HOLY GODS OF MC BUILDERS
I almost never subscribe but you sir earned it like I'm subbed to 8 people 5 of them IRL friends that is truly amazing keep it up
this looks so good im so hyped to play this
This makes me excited for Skyrim: VI
Story idea: Make a code that lava and water can't produce obsidian. So the player is forced to search the missing blocks ( from the portal ) scattered around the map. You can add this to your story, why the portal exits, how and why is it destroyed. You can build hidden dungeons where the obsidian is hidden and protected by traps, monsters and other challenges for the player. Every dungeon should be in a different difficulty level, just for fun.  Good luck and eat tooth paste!
Maybe in the nether, you can upgrade the nether fortresses and add a bit backstory to them?
build a nether
this man is insane
You could make a world generation mod
Yo you should do how to build tutorial videos I love this style
Plzz include dungeons
the story of excalibur
wow... just wow. Maybe you could make a secret basement in one of the houses?
How long did this take
The thumbnail reminds me of settlers of catan
Brush yo goddamn bottom teeth bro
THIS NEEDS 1M VIEWS
join hermitcraft maybe?
I have a question if you post this map how would I play it on on console
This is absolutely fantastic to watch!!
I saw the original landscape on reddit :) great job!
Make a Rickrolling QR Code
Just wow
how do i get the world download ?????
This is the only man who can make literal whole survival worlds look not like a bunch of blocks, but literally make it look as beautiful as hyrule from botw
You cant do it in minecraft pe
I think u might have gotten 80k likes
Transforming a woodland mansion would be epic :D
This map would be awesome to play, wondering how hard it would be to add in some additional underground ore/cave generation for ores, if I wanted to add a couple mods too though on the finalised map.
This is so underrated like what the heck youre so talented
The Dislikes are from people who dont understand ART
Well well well, this video has WELL over 80K likes.
Ayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
how are you going to restructure the nether
This is the best idea ever
Wynncraft smp
Woah when i can im downloading the map
Are you going to use some mods for this? I think some Alex's Mobs mobs could fit well due to how close they are to vanilla's style for the most part.
Wow, this is absolutely incredible
If this will be a world download, will it be on Minecraft Bedrock if it is a download?
U should do a 100 day in survival hardcore mode challenge
seed pls
Wow this is soo nice 😇 u have so much talent and time for this amazing world. its looks so perfect 😇😱 i wish i could create this as well 😊 Also, my idea would be....make new places like neither biome, dragon biome, and make a heaven looking biome 😶 all in one place 😶 😁
You just got a sub and i'm gonna send this to my friends, so hoppely more.
add a medieval village in the dark wood forest
Is the map ( whennits finished) free?
I would really love to see some ravines, I think maybe a village in a ravine in the mountains?
This is some breath of the wild shit
*listen man , i need that finished world download*
Trixy is this available for bedrock edition
make a secret cult on the map somewhere that worships herobrine or sum
You're an amazing creator
PART 2 💥💥💥💳 NOW💥💥💥💳
Two villagers look at God who redesign their homes be like:  “He’s cool, but hmm ... I have liked our design more!"
I thought this was a seed
The ice biome should be more dignified like a ice castle and the slums down below it or something
A circular laberynth somewhere with a sort of treasure would be awesome!
You should actually make these into nft's and mod the game so these spawn naturally.
prfesin
add a full dungeon with  traps and mobs
there are no words in the english dictionary to describe this
We’re a little over 80k likes. Good job man
Hey trixy I've got u a challenge....... reply and I will tell u
This makes Minecraft’s normal structures look like dirt huts
part 2 part 2 part 2
w-wow maybe you can make a lab under a igloo our a villager house and keep a test villager and a zombie in the lab? you got a sub
16,000 blocks, seems legit  (yes i read his comment)
subbed
this is so cool I'm subscribing rn and well since you're already customizing trees maybe put one or two mega giant trees in the forests? ancient giant magic trees in the center of forests are always very cool
Please continue this I’m really interested in your channel
Free download...?
big jungle temple and monkey
Elli
Pac man world Lol
You could make a pirate themed pillager outpost on coastal region
Cool
I don't know who you are, but that's epic, I'm subscribing
bakre
Villager approve
Perfect map doesn't exi-
Make a Yeti frozen in ice plz
a massive dragon skeleton
Not me sleeping wonder what others biome would be like
just...wow...I'm speechless. I fully intend to play this when you finish it
Your project is enormous I'm sure it's going to be a great successful experience
I wish there was a download link. Damn its such a cool map.
This guy should join Hermitcraft or start a survival world
Idea : a large pilleger base and not just a tower!!
map download?
Imagine how sick it would be if worlds were randomly generated like this
Mojang should hire this guy! He will upgrade the whole game!
I'll keep a close eye on this because it looks great
Plz do more this is so amazing
get to work our building slav- ehhhh volunteer
This look like its from lord of the rings
Add floating ice islands near the snowy biomes
Ideas for the desert biome : Maybe structure reminding of ancient Egypt/ Sumerian (Babel Tower) you could even do the legendary suspended garden of Babylone, make it hidden/secret underground or in plain sight with enigmas revolving around ancient mythology.  I also had an idea but maybe it's a bit too far fetched : A castle in the sky, like Laputa in the Miyazaki film and in the travels of Gulliver ? It would make a really cool god sanctuary (could be abandonned or populated by a very old and wise civilisation)
You should add a ruined portal in each biome or major point of interest. It would make it seem like there was a connection between them all
you should put this on mineraft market place for those who dont own a pc  i totally dont play on playstation....
Minecraft remastered edition
waaaaaat no nonnnonono way uwu
Trixy's Rule:  *Every house needs a chimney.*
Why do you keep calling it survival? This map is absolutely amazing! But it’s not survival, so I’m confused on why you keep saying that
You should do a collab with PheonixSc to make more of these features work :)
Mojang should hire you 👍🏼👍🏼
Part 2!!!
I'm downloading this a month before it comes out, this is Minecraft heaven :D
It would be EPIC if you made like a lord of the rings inspired castle moc in one of the biomes(up to you)
THIS IS SO COOL!!
Please do the rest of the biomes I love your biulds
Make a small crashed spacecraft in the desert
Also add a Wild West In The snow biome like in read dead redemption 2 at the beginning
minecraft
I was watching a video about the best minecraft builds, and I happened to see a 1:1 scale of the Avengers Sokovia scene It was by my favourite minecraft YouTuber ;D
He got 2x likes he asked for
Me, with my dirt house 👁💧👄💧👁
YouTube algorithims like you
This is soo cool
Minecraft 1.27 be like
can u show the download link
suggestion- catacombs under the jungle
You should use create mod for the windmill and other things
Could this maybe get a copy for bedrock edition
Dam, I was looking for the link when i realised "2 days ago"
This reminds me of the greed island from hxh
Men this deserves more likes and subscribers
Can we get it for downloading as quickly  as possible...so i can use it as a multiplayer map and play with my friends
I would like to see and abandoned/destroyed old vallina building hide in the map
Part 2? =)
put a diary in the snowy biome few scouts went to search for food that was almost a month ago what could have happened to them.
My list of ideas (I) and [ideas for] changes (C):  (C) At the ruined portal, I would change some of the normal stone with blackstone, and I would make the stairs a bit broken.
Sheesh
Uhhh why hasnt mojang asked trixyblox to just remake the game? It would be SOOO much cooler that not gonna lye
You just made Minecraft 2
Maybe I would build old catacombs under the death village or... cave village
"80,00 Likes" People: 162k take it or leave it"
Fire vidio but what about mansions
Trixy this actually insane bro good luck!
Okay but what is the app you use to make the world?
Hi will this be available in minecraft PE and can you please put it for everyone not just for patriot because I can’t get it and i love the build and your channel
Create an island 1000 blocks away from the main island where there is a gothic style castle with vindicators and summoners (pretending to be vampires)
Ik this would be a lot more work, but i really really hope he makes something for the nether as well
He should make a custom nether hub and end city/crystal towers
amazing
can you customize the end and the nether in the same world 🙏🙏
I think in your next video you should build minecraft animals in your style , and in a zoo
where is the download ?
"this map will be survival friendly" begins making custom trees right after that will be a pain to cut down.
i have no words
Idea: in the mushroom thing biome forgot the name, add a giant mushroom with a mystical treehouse and fantasy lighting
vrmmm
Release this as a map because it's going to be so popular.
You should make a maze in the desert pyramid :)
Amazing
You should make kinda like a horror kinda scary back story about the snowy biome with diarys saying stuff about idk do something cool like it
trixy is insane and epic :D
Send us a link of this map!!!It is urgent!
trixy my mind is blown how do u get these ideas i love how u explained and u made and ur designs love ya waitng for next biome
This is fucking dope
WOAHHH THAT'S SO COOL Make sure not to overwork yourself, this project seems really huge.
The church is too big, it looks like a cathedral you could find in a town/city, but not like a church you would find in a small village. At least in my opinion. I am however really excited to see what you are building next and of course how it will look once you finished! I'm looking forward to playing this world, no matter how much time it will take you, to build it!
This is how Minecraft should be
that's some beautiful art
Very epic
For the world download also convert the world to a bedrock world for bedrock players <3 :)
I don’t think anyone will see this but u should Make really long roads connecting different village biomes so it is easier to travel everywhere
this world looks way better than the real one, change my mind
Add a plain
Underground city. There should definitely be an underground city or large cave system
will we get the map to play?
yoooo this is really nice looking! i would totally be down to get a bunch of friends together to play a survival game on this map.
Don't forget caves.
NICEEEEEEEE!
minecraft: the elder scrolls 6
Yooo great man it's almost like one piece
Just got a 106 min long ad lol
who else noticed the fact that the plains biome kinda looks like the fortnite map tho
How do you download world? Ps it looks AMAZING
Mojang should hire you at this point
Do we get this one free when it's done??
Fucking underrated
I have ans idea """ BIG MUSHROOMS"""
download where??
An idea for the snow biome: maybe make a snow kingdom or Castle.
Bro hats off for the effort and time you put into making this map. You have talent my friend.   IDEA:- Tree houses in the jungle village can be cool and different from the rest of the villages.  Like you have so much scope to make this even better by adding details and pathways,elevator etc.  Edit:- Reply you ideas to improve this .
Amazing ! Maybe add more houses since the village increased in size it should also increade in population
Wait this was you? I saw this on reddit! Wait...    That was a repost wasn't it
Is this Island a copy of the Bionicle Island?
You are a Minecraft Legend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm so hyped to play this in vr
Can you make a secret underground place where gapples netherite armor and weapons and op items
I can't wait for the map to be realised!!   I subbed 😊  Hope the map is free to download
Elder scrolls 6 lookin nice
You should have tried to make the windmill spin
Bro has the time for all this.... AND HAS A GIRLFRIEND?!??!!
I wish I can built this good all I can built is a square
eyelashes go by by
As soon as this man said the temple of time I was like I subbed liked now what's next?
This map for some reason reminds me of Ark: Survival evolved  Edit: this world would make a good roleplay world imo
amazing
i know its probably not possible but if there is any way to download this map on console someone please tell me
Man you should put some sort of Abandon science lab were something Escape  Another idea is a Giant dragon Skull or bones
This would be perfect with tango tek’s villager mod
This is so cool! i wish I had Java edition so I could download the world. Keep up the good work!
Blacksmith
The thumbnail looks awfuly sussy😳
My teeth being white af but cant even build a house
If Grian had a child it would have been Trixy  Btw love your vids Trixy
I'm subbing
Talent
this would be amazing for minecraft hunger games
When we can download this world I actually don't want to break any blocks. It's so beautiful!
i would really like to download this world and you are really good builder
A suggestion, as requested: I don't know if this would be too hard (probably would be) but are you gonna transform the Nether at all? You have that big portal in the middle - you could go through there and customize the Nether so that when people inevitably fix that portal and light it up, they'll walk into a fresh revamped nether (at least, the starting area will be unique).  This way, you could upgrade the fortress and the bastion, add a few new Nether structures (same way that you said you were gonna add custom structures to biomes that didn't already have them), and tie in the story that you're building in the overworld to the nether as well.  Obviously I realize this may not be feasible, seeing as A) I dunno how complicated it would be to sculpt terrain in the Nether like you do for the Overworld and B) it would likely add a huge amount onto an already colossal project, but nevertheless that's just my suggestion - I think it would be really cool!  Fantastic video, I'm looking forward to seeing more :)
Minecraft 2.1 be like:
An abandoned city would be really cool😍 for inspiration you can take a look to the game Horizon zero dawn
Dude can you hide like a sword stuck in stone somewhere hidden, which ends up giving you a diamond/netherite sword
Dude can you hide like a sword stuck in stone somewhere hidden, which ends up giving you a diamond/netherite sword
PLEASE make this a map we can play, I really want to play it brooo
You are the one whose project I saw on reddit!
minecraft should really hire trixy to help them build/upgrade stuff, like bro you cant say no to these builds
holy Christ you are such a passionate and talented person
oh yes!!
this is like the game ARK
Need sand? walks lots of blocks to the desert
paying this paying that cmon
Just saying, your a legend!!!!
I think it'd be amazing if the Mushroom Island was volcanic
can I have this in bedrock edition please
Really looking forward to how you will do the end dimension and the nether
Oh my god you are the Minecraft god!!
For survival Minecraft. Builds an anvil that defies gravity
PLEASE Add CAVES AND ORES UNDER GROUND
When is this going to be downloadable? It is insane, so excited to see more of it :DDD
I wanna play this, could I download it from somewhere?
Can you downlad map??? plz tell me that you can???
I wont talk much I am just subscribing
This is so cool
Maybe you can put a waterfall in one of the biomes
I think it'd look very nice if you put castle ruins around the nether portal (maybe not the whole castle, I just think it'd lool amazing if you put 2 fallen down towers to the sides of the portal)
this will be great if u made this a mod, put new mob in it and new weapon cuz its like a masterpiece
Add a huge underground cavern with either a gigantic alien type end portal or an ancient demonic nether portal or tree:P
This really reminds me of the forgotten lands from shadow of the colossus.
I wish Mojang makes an actual Story Mode. Talking to villagers, recieving quests from illagers or villagers, stories to uncover, a main quest and so on...
Yo trixie should add a Abandoned military-base or a blown up nuclear-plant both of these could explain why the dark oak forest village is infected
0:01 WHEN THE ISLAND IS SUS 1!1!1!!!1!1!1 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵😳😳😳😳😳😳
what the downlad link?
Map kinda sus
make a secret giant music machine
can you crate a 5235 easter egg
We got the video to 160 000 likes!
Why does he look so fake
I just hope no one bootlegs the finished project
Plis make a house like Beecher's Hope from Red Dead Redemption 2
Thats insane bro your cracked
Yesss I want this mappp
Heyy I can from Rslach
I feel like adventure maps would be better with music it adds that nerdy feeling that your in a adventure
the fact that i already found a ruined portal that big
Idea: the infected village was made due to an election, where a corrupt leader won the votes and turned his citizens into zombies in exchange for a giant emerald mine in the Snowy Mountain biome.
This is amazing!
i would hate to play in this world simply because my builds would loook soooooo bad in comparrison :'D
4k?!
You should make a kind of village in the mountains. Like a huge cave with houses built into the stone. The story behind this could be that the villagers wanted to mine the emeralds that’s in the mountains. But it was almost impossible to live in the Climate of the biome so they started building a village inside the mountain
One thing you could have done with the portal was make the stairs more ruined by putting cracks in between
what if you make a new wbiome with flying islands
13:45 look closely, in the farm, villager go up, villager go down.
When part two?
is there only gonna be 1 village per biome?
You should redesign the nether bext
mojang should hire this guy
I can make a dirt house...
sus
you need a swamp right there in between the plains and mooshroom biome
I WANT MORE OF THIS PLEASE I BEG U
Oml! I wish I could build like u! Keep it Up 👍
Do a mosque for the desert. please
I feel like Trixy should be the structure designer for Minecraft
will we get to download the world
Maybe there could be this underwater cavern? And the further down you go, the better the loot you can find gets
Bro can You please please pleaseeee tell me how to get that map, i mean not the edited map, the original one, cuz i rl need itttttttt
That might be a little interesting for the story to
Can you make a abandoned temple for old gods that caused the whole island to go into chaos?
I thought this man built the entire wano country until I look at the title
Boy, where are the ads? You God dam earned them, so use them. You can't let us alone just because u can't afford it anymore. (Insane Map again can't wait to download it)
BEAUTIFUL
THIS IS SO COOL MY MAN
I can't wait for this to be finished.
Can't wait
I FUCKING LOVE THIS WORLD
Maybe other Minecraft YouTubers can make let’s play videos on this map when you’re finished? Thoughts?
Build
will we be able to play this locally, or do we also have to pay on pateron for this world?
I'm subscribing!
THIS IS CRAZY
I wish I could get this on bedrock..
Someone's gonna have to start a creat let's play in this world 😍
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
Wtf amphiba
You should add a dragon cave to the mountains
damm!! its way too much work can't ingnore the like button !
if it was only a mc server :(
Idea Maybe make a railway connecting all the biomes. If you already did that then sorry for waisting your time
I love this!
THIS WAS PUBLISHED ON MY BIRTHDAY🧀
wouldn't it be logical for the village to have walls, to protect itself from pillager raids? It would be more realistic, but less minecrafty.
why does the map looks sus
Im so jealous of this guy's skill
A frozen castle on the mountain in the ice biome would be cool. It over looks the frozen village below.
so cool
next up making hobbit map
Amazing
I think it's a little past 80k likes now
Minecraft :- we need this man at our company
Can't wait to try this
"Get this vid to 80k likes"......  It's been 1 day ...and its 153k right now  Amazing work ...keep it up ...😁👌
You are an amazing minecraft builder
Could you give us the shaders and texture pack (custom sky) to enhance our experience with your world. Would be great thanks! <3
how ist the worl he creates in world painter where he havent even build on looks so much cooler then everything i ever build
It would be cool to see a river come down from a hot spring in the snowy mountain's and go through the plains
Anyone else saw this on Reddit
You haaaaaaaave to put all the rest of your builds into it. You haaaaaaaave to
fortnite should hire you for map designs lmao
Him: Ok that's enough work for today... (Forgets to save the world)   Edit: For the people fighting on the comments: Relax..... It is a joke
you are a great builder
Awesome. I just wish the Island would look more than a pizza with a bite taken out from it
Imagine doing a 100 days in hardcore here.
Deam this is the best Survival map i see
YOOOOOOOOO
Will this be available for mobile??
maybe after this big project you can build some greek structures? just like you did last time the aztec and egyptian project, but this time with greece monuments. it would be really cool to see this! btw i really appreciate your hard work man, this what are you doing is so crazy and coool at the same time <3
Are you gonna make the caves to?
Beautiful absolutely stunning
is there a place where i can download those custom brushes?
amazing
ayo i may look dumb or sum but you could do a worldpainter tutorial
mabye add quests from the villagers
TrixyBlox: I only made minor changes  Also TrixyBlox: Changes the entire build
why did i think fortnite when i saw the thumbnail.
Pls pls pls pls pls pls PRETTY PWEASE                  BOB ROSS THE BOSS REFERENCE
Man. I've been stumped in my building for a long time, it's so nice to have some form of references and inspiration for new builds, you've earned my sub😂
I love how the villagers start doing their job immediately without even hesitation! Such good workers c:
Him: "Get this video to 80K likes"  The Video: at 115K likes Me: Yes
This is better than the Minecraft updates, they need to add all that in minecraft
lol is there anyway I can download this world
This is minecraft
Make stronghold and end portal inside the mountains
I’m also really excited for the story aspect of the map; that’s such an interesting idea
Hey, would you be okay with people streaming their adventures on this map? I think it’d be really cool to stream. Also maybe there could be a ship wreck at the edge of the plains biome and that could be how the player got to the island so they’re a little more immersed? Just an idea! No pressure. Regardless of your answer to the streaming thing, I can’t wait for this to be out. Being able to explore and check out some nicer builds and how you utilize your blocks is gonna be awesome. It’s already looking absolutely beautiful.
Ultimate survival world imminently goes into creative
Make the Pillager outpost have a half built bridge leading to the mushroom island like if they planned to go there
Idk why but the way he made stuff reminded me of ElderScrolls Skyrim and the mayor part of Zelda games
You could get like a lil bit of concept of the 1.17 and make like epic ravines or caves
you should make some kind of wagon train camp thingy in the plains or mesa
This is so cool!! I can’t wait till it comes out and take a look around :)
1:44 the backstory behind this would be rlly interesting to see, i hope u keep the idea of a backstory
You should try out the chisels and bits mod. I think you'd like it.
this made me do my own thing like this but not the same thing
It took 3 days for the vid to reach the goal
You sound like maxmoefoe.
It would be cool If you would add hidden rooms in some buildings. For example under the church you could have a hidden ”cult” room
Wow I can’t wait to see a 100 hundred days of this it  will be amazing
No one needs to build anything in Minecraft if this implements inside the game. I loved this video 😍 😍 😍
Me: *cant even build a 16x20 house*
you would need a hurricane to even begin to make that wind mill turn
What is the seed
This is like watching Gordon Ramsay making food but, not angry.
where's the end portal gonna be and are u gonna do anything in the neither
I watched 30 seconds and subscribed
is this not breath of the wild but better?
I’m sure someone has already suggested this but it would be SO COOL if you could include some stuff from the 1.17 update (ik ur probably work working in an official release, but ur clearly VERY creative so I doubt that would be much of a hindrance) I was thinking excavation sites mostly, but if you could work in like,, an above ground cave biome that would be INCREDIBLE!! This is phenomenal already tho, keep it up!!
Once 4 nations lived in harmony until desert attacked.
Well this be modded friendly?
Minecraft should hire him
Will this be on ps4?
add cool modes
Once this comes out, im def using this for my smp
Is there interior for every build?
Woah, that’s gorgeous! I want to play it in survival already!!!  YOU ARE AWESOME, DUDE!
Hopefully when the map is complete we can play on it with no lag ofc 😅
Could be a story world or something too
Add a cave in the snowy a mountainy biome making it look like a yeti cave.
Are you a botw hacker because you could replace the level design team in an instant.
I'm pretty sure there are Snowy mountains next to deserts in real life.
That's soo awesome!!!
Nice work, this world is fireeee
Australia in a Map
wait so we have to pay for this? no thanks
this is a work of art my friend
Nobody is as good with World painter as trixyblocks
Dang this is hype brother love your vids and hope to see your future challenges 👍
A survival server design including shops lobby and more
You are so talented so creative like bro fucking sick its reallyyy gooddd amazing i have no comments
Free Download when the project is done? Plz
man, I cried watching this, this was my absolute dream, like, really
"Its a simple build" The build:
I thought that I could build a good village but I guess I'm wrong.
Soooo when is Mojang hiring you?
Yo! I saw the blank island on Reddit and I didn't even realize it was you!
Add a Atticus mortimer refrence  please
this should be a world option
absoultly amazing
U could maybe make a like stronghold under the mushroom biome and make some story to it that that island is the gateway to the end
THIS IS SO GOOD! You have a new subscriber! I am very excited for this, especially the Mesa biome! Nice Job!!!
Damn
Quickest subscription I’ve ever given
Absolutely phenomenal, holy moly! Excited to see what's next!
Here’s an idea why don’t you make like a giant pirate ship, like an absolutely massive one and if you were to make an underwater city they could be direct enemies with each other it could also help with the story like the pirates hunt down the sea people, mermaids or whatever because they could be used in slavery or something I don’t know it’s just an idea  Edit: the boat could also be a mix between a steam boat, the black Perl (pirates of the Caribbean) and metal beards ship from the Lego movie.
Can you try to make some map available on bed rock
never have I wanted to experience a minecraft map so much
Can I get the map
I love the Breath of the Wild style plains
could we have the files at the end of the map plz plz plz ; )
Mojang. just hire him already. This dude had amazing talent. *take notes*
if you like drawing you should subscribe to Popcross studios this is not selfpromoting i just want to get that guy to 500k
I, for one, would love to see a small cat island or village, and same for wolves/dogs.
This is superb! Can't wait to see the other biome, this can be a server survival game like if you're a hardcore minecraft player, you can stay here for the time given to survive like 300 days or conquer other teams, such potential!
I saw the thumbnail and thought of the "These are cattails" vid
Under one of the biomes or under the mountains put ur stronghold castle but there’s one way in and that way needs a key but u have to go through a ton of quests and stuff to find that key idk just a thought
This is AMAZING!!!
This is amazing
Keep the comments so they get on recomended
can you add the eygptian temple and jungle temple i will add some mod to get a good boss fight
This man could beat Grian.
I have no idea how he got so talented but it’s truly amazing 🤯
Bedrock players be like:
you should put some quest or hints in books around the world that helps you to find treasures or secret dungeons
I would love to see some ice caverns and caves in the snowy mountains biome. Potentially with remnants of an ancient civilization with of the walls of ice, or maybe even the remains of an ancient beast?.....
This video is influencing me to play minecraft again
1 day in, over 150k likes. I'm getting this map, and no one can stop me.
Looking forward to the map. Instantly earned my subscription.
yo aint that the world of amphibia 🤨
how to download this map pls tell
This is just so crazy!!!!
Looking forward to play on this
Next video coming soon or ?
brush yo teeth
Bruh try and add some dungeons.
can u include dababy car?
I wonder if he will make it compatible for caves and cliff would love to play this with the new update
I would like you include an reffance to youtuber who have inspired you
Your eyelashes tho 🤮
IMPORTANT: Don't put the witch huts in the Mooshroom biome because witches WONT SPAWN. Mooshroom biomes have a feature where no hostile mobs spawn on them.
I think you should build a big detailed bridge connecting from the main island to the mushroom biome
I need this map
shader?
This is sick
Pls say that java maps can be converted into bedrock, pls 🥺
Inpersive
The lowly yugoslavian proportionately battle because blowgun developmentally chase atop a knowing vacuum. daffy, solid philosophy
where is part 2
Cant wait to get the map and enjoy its beauty.
How can I download the world?
is it just only me or yall thought of rl craft after seein dis too?
This is Lit!!
For the winter biome please ad a maple syrup farm. I know it's not in the game but it would be cool.🍁🍁
Can U Add volcano on the Snow mountain please let   and Also A Random house For A villager or a Wandering.trader In the Snow  Sadly The New Type of mob that attack u with snow don't win the vote that will be cool tho
This map is pure talent and Hard work
Where can I download the custom brushes?
This is epic!
Please try and create a kind of big underground research facility type thing where an easter egg or something like that is
You should make another island wich contain the stronghold you had previously done
LETS FUCKING GO, I’VE BEEN HERE SINCE THE BEGINNING AND HERE YOU FUCKING GLOW!!! CONGRATSS🎉🎉🎉🎉  I’m Aeip6thy on YouTube and Instagram lol. ❤️❤️❤️😎😂
Make a bastion in the nether!
make an abandoned research facility in one of the snowier biomes
My Suggestions and Ideas: - A giant cave under the island. - An underwater biome - A sky city - A Corrupted biome - A small island next to the main island that has a volcano on it
Yo I saw this on Reddit a couple of days ago
Add an Ice spikes biome And completely re-decorate
idea for the stronghold - lean more into the maze theme, I'm thinking like an abandoned dungeon. And for the portal room, maybe make it like the great hall in how to train your dragon, with massive pillars on each wall, and the portal itself in the center, acting like a great center piece under a giant burning chandelier... idk, just a thought
plz why dont you have 10M subs? you deserve it.....
Just joined on the road for 2M
Ideas:bigger stronghold 1.An underground area where it looks similar to the nether but it isnt rather its a underground volcano sort of thing 2.multiple islands around the main land which are reachable by boat and have good treasure
This is a really cool idea, I hope to see more soon
Anyone know how to make a huge world paint map
This looks amazing!
You should make this world downloadable for those who want to explore in your creation. Looks good 💯
This village is pretty environmentally friendly next second adds a quarry
me wanting to speed run this only without speed run
Fortnite chapter 3
Lol,80k likes he said,more like 152k likes in one day
Since you said Breath of the Wild was a main inspiration, I think it would be cool if there was Small pillager camps like bokoblin camps with small rewards like resources and weapons. Idk just thought more botw like things would be cool mixed in with the Minecraft elements
THIS IS AMAZING
Make a mosque in the desert biome lol
a cave :)
You should make the famous stonehenge monument in the plains in England
i need moreeee
He’s talking to the beat of the song
make a netherite block AT 69 69 69
2:13 how to make so much of terrain to be rendered?
Plz make a world java download plx
I have a good idea inspiration in anime called ^Itomori Town^ heheh i like that so much (^-^)
Seed
where link?
Make a Monarch outpost from Godzilla King  of the monsters specifically Kind ghidorahs
Holy shit his is incredible
What do you think about a village for wandering traders
This is so impressive! Pog
I've always thought of a place that mobs come from. Like a castle that was abandoned and the mobs (skeletons, zombies etc.) inhabited. They use it as a hideout during day, and emerge during the night. What do you think?
Can you do nether too?
"80.000"? we almost at double what you asked for literally 2 days in
I already want to play on that, it looks epic!! :D
What I would love this story to be is that the player isn't a special figure. Like they're here to solve all problems, and is the answer to everything. I want them to just a bystander who stumbled into something, and are just a part of this massive world
You are so good at building village and more in minecraft. Keep it up!
it would be cool if there where was a custom coral reef around the ocean monument.
How long did this take
Make a Guild in every village in every  biome and put some task on those guilds
What about a blacksmith
JESUS IT'S AMAZING
Dear Diary  Hrr, hrr hrr hrr hrrr
I. Need. To. Play. This.
Oh my goooooooooooood SHEEEEEEESH
I'm getting some shadow of the collossus/ breath of the wild vibes
Trixy u deserve more subs than dat!! Btw congrats on 1M subs
6:50 "dummies, you dummy"  also, this should be a mod as it is wonderful
i think the nether should get a upgrade too. not a big one but make it look like people has been there since you know the ruined portal is well already been built a bit so ye maybe some nether houses/make it look like a big fight went on in a fortress. also if ya want the end too not much there so up to you.
Its not even fair how good he is at building.
will this be downloadable map ?
Could you try to make a small cabin in the snowy biome with diary entries about a man starving? And them a skelleton and a wolf in the basement (kept seperate so the Wolf doesnt kill the skeleton) so you can tame the dead mans dog?
Snowy Biome idea: top off a trapdoor with snow, under is a hidden room like a laboratory, chest room, or someone who lives there
pls start working at mojang
For whenever you get to the desert, perhaps you can something based on the Pyramids of Giza. For the either the Dark Oak Forest or Taiga biomes, you could build a small logging site. Finally the jungle could have a small volcano and the jungle temple can be integrated into it somehow.
An enjoyable in game DnD champagne could be done on this map when finished. With additional work (signs and books) a guided champagne could be done for those that cannot find a DM.
I feel like there should be more hills everywhere, not to big though! Keep up the amazing work man!
Nooo why am i so early :(((  I look forward to the builds :D
Do u have the map download for this
Woodland mansion, stronghold and the caves would fit in here. I suggest also transforming an area of the nether, and maybe add a conduit underwater too. Ooh ooh, what about transforming a bit of the end too. Sorry getting too ambitious
Savanna should have many rocks and giant rocks, also a huge lake that replenishes the trees and a river
Include a underworld but the theme is water
Dude!!! You nailed it💯💯💯💯. That hardwork🤯🤯🤯
I love it is my video.🥳❤️ Please can you make Angkor watt cambodia!!!🇰🇭
This feels like a minecraft version of breath of the wild, super excited since I've put in a good 200 hours into that game and I miss playing it for the first time
Can you buld a custum nether in the world pls
Offline gamers: Minecraft isn't fun because there's no story  Trixy: let me change that
I love this so much. You are so talented and your work is absolutely amazing. As soon as this comes out as a playable map, i will 100% do a survival world on it. Good job bud
That Pillager Tower is fire I think thats my favorite structure
I just got this randomly in my recommendation and now I subbed
You should be Mojangs Vanilla building designer👍✔️
Dream Manhunt on this map would be SIIICK
Maybe you can add some stone statue in the jungle alone for some mythical story telling  Ex: here lie's the hero of....
do more
Mojang should hire you for a new update which changes the minecraft vanilla World.
The real question here is: why doesnt minecraft hire him and builders like him to design their buildings so they look better?!?! Like, these new designs he created are so amazing!!
for the winter biome you could probably have an alter to odin or other such pagan gods
idea : a giant mushroom in the middle of the mushroom island
this is so cool good job
i saw this on reddit
Make a better desert
Dream’s manhunts and speed runs are gonna be a lot harder bow
Minecraft Manhunt on this map,,
Mad respect.
Are we all thinking the same thing about making it a download able map
Mad props. Wow!
Make in de center of the sand biome a big pyramid with on the top a king temple made of quarts and on the corners of the temple: 4 basic desert temples!                                                        Maybe a small cowboy town more on the right side of the center
MORE
This is actually a rpg map
It's crazy how good your upload rate is considering how big these builds are
Mojang: am I a joke to you?
It would be cool if one of the future villages had a big wall surrounding it to protect the villagers from zombies and other hostile mobs. Could also in some way ad to the lore
This is epic !!
skyrim who?
You must get someone to mod this world to fit its story
Put a mosque in the sand biome. You can get inspiration for it by looking at pictures of the great mosque of Mecca.
The issue with custom trees for survival is that they are a paaaiin to chop down but you really can't do without to upgrade vanilla properly
you should make the structures and put them into a world gen mod and that would be fun
Can I download this map for android too?
Is it just me or does the library remind anyone else of the animal crossing town hall?
The motivation and creativity is incredible!  This deserves more attention than it currently has.
im guessing you use a lot of commands so this is my command for you  give me the next episode i want it
Bro I need to play that
Imagine if this was a multiplayer map with factions for each biome.
Add ancient civilization dungeon
Mojang should watch it
How about ores?
You could have used some mods like create to add more realism to the village houses like the windmill and pillager outpost
You could add in the sea some groups of whales, that gives you oil when killed, and wich the villagers except tribes trade very expensive. To do that you could add sea ships, like caravels,and cannons, arpons,etc. And you could add some easter eggs of giant sea monsters, like kraken. And with that you could add a new villager type, the sailor, to help you
This might be the best Minecraft video I have ever seen🏆
massive respect for this guy. His mass creative talent and not only that but the effort he must go into to make these videos is crazy.
Can i dowload this in bedrock??
OMFG  Its beautiful
Some Lord of the rings like mines and seeviliages.
I wouldnt play survival on this map just because anythin that i build would look like shit compared to this
So cool
Upgrade the mobs to became deadly and make new species with the mobs. Make a human that can speak to us and help through out our journey.
I hope this map can be downloaded into bedrock as well.
use seasonal celebrations like: Christmass (Santa's house and Christmass tree) in the winter biome and Halloween (Like a Ghost Town) in the dark forest biome
um... who's gonna tell him? it's at 150k
Can you do a hot air balloon in the snowy moutans
I saw the map on a reddit post yesterday, this is awesome... maybe someone stole ur work on that map, or maybe u posted it... I really don't know, but this is going to be epic
I saw this on reddit
The legend of trixia the breath of life
end and the towers:i think i should be in dustbin end city:of u should be in dustbin where should i be?
CAN'T WAIT FOR PART TWO!!! AHHHH
Wow I would love to see some skyrim like castles in the snowbiome
Imagine playing hunger games in that
How to play this
You should make a gigantic ancient floating island. Kinda like Angel Island from sonic.
We need a Grian Vs Trixy build battle I swear.
I've never seen a gaming youtuber getting so many likes in such a short time
make a pirate ship or an airship  where you can see the whole map
A quite big cave with an enormous skeleton, like the fossil but upgraded.
Can you make a tutorials series / episode on how you use world edit etc?
You should put a back to the future 3 reference in the wild west area
Him:A cathedral Smallish beans:NAH NAH NAH *spends 24 hours in Minecraft*THIS IS A CATHEDRAL
Wow, that looks amazing!! 😁 I admire your good effort and detail- I watched right to the end! 😊 You have also gained a sub! By the way is it similar to the normal spruce forest biome or is it more like mega taiga? I recommend big, tall, full leaved trees and maybe even light grey glass in the sky to increase atmosphere and danger!
You forgot blacksmith
Make a snowy castle in the snow biome
Trixy please make a ravine, but it has people living inside with a village
Will you customize the nether if so you should Make that village for the piglins
I'm digging a 1 by 3 tunnel
Transform the nether too, things like an intact bastion and better biomes!
Omg 150 k in 1 day
Why this remind me of gunshin impact
Cool but where did his eye lashes go
9:26 I don't see how farming meat is environmentally unfriendly
When I first saw this video, I was like, "How do I favorite this video? I'm only 10 minutes in!"
Imagine you use this map and structures in survival mode. The villagers will have better houses than you.
My pc specs are 4gb ram i5 and I think this world is not for me I think my game will just crash
Mushroom Island smurfs
Mushroom Island smurfs
Trixy i suggest to put your previous projects in that map 😃
We can feel u r effort trixy
hey good job with the builds, they look very nice. But i need to point our that u said at 8:34 that the farmer should live in a windmill. I gotta say that you dont see people living in windmills cuz its very loud, so maybe u could add a rustic house for the farmer instead. He would be very greatfull.  Good job man keep up the work :D
Maybe A revean
A Big Salute For This Man Who Made This Possible✔️
INSAAAANE
Ooh this was so cool - I think it would be so cool to have like dungeons and stuff like in RPG’s but I can’t wait to see what you’ll do
This in VR and shaders :O

MOREE this is just straight up good content and i am really looking forward to see more of this

This guy is trying to recreate the Fortnite map in Minecraft props to him 🥶
And then start a SMP.
Only thing I would ask about is Wheres the swamp region?
pls make a mod with al the upgraded  buildings somebody please do it because then Minecraft will look way better
@TrixyBlox I would like to see in Dark Oak Forst a Woodland Mansion because I would thing that would be a good fit and make it look haunted or look like The Spencer Mansion from Resident Evil just a theory
This gives me adventure time world of Ooo vibes
Got an idea for a new profession building Blacksmith
It reminds me of the rdr2 map so much, its like the same choice of biomes that game has.
Minecraft needs to hire this guy.
This is the guy who we call "Master Builder"!
Wow, this is awesome! Glad he used BotW as a reference
i need the download
bob ross reference, yes
Suggestion:make one main big village and make a statue to make it look like the village used to have hero or make it like the villager are worshiping a god   (Its okay if you didn't  read this)
The map reminds me of that one lego bionic show
Where is the download?
This is worth money, not for free.
Wait is this playable and if so how can we play it :)
The Elder Scrolls: Minecraft
I guess this is what a person does when they’ve done everything there is to do in minecraft
These should be the actual structures
This is entertaining I love it I give sub :D
Me two seconds after 80000 likes:  Where update
Please make this a series where you build another building every day and an ai where these spawn normally
this comment is to promote the video
You make it like Clash of Clan... Or Clash Royale.!
on this vid in the desc please
i want this as my survival map
The only problem i see is the mob spawning and biomes in f3
Hey if u ever add new biomes you should do swamp flower forest and snowy tundra
This is really cool
damn thanks youtube recommendeds
How much time did this take?
Could you make these structures into a mod?
Man you have grown a lot just yesterday you where at 1.5 million and now 1.7 million
Yo place the end portall in the mines of the massa biome and the lab in the snowy mountains wud be cool as gold
I really wanna download it but I know it’s gonna cost money which I guess is fair
The AMMOUNT OF WORK put into these videos IS MINDBLOWING! Literally THE MOST dedicated youtuber!
In fact its NOT survival playable reason: You dont want to destroy anything that beautiful
Build a Abadoned House from a old survivor and secrets from that old survivor
I hope i can build like this in my minecraft worl... :(
could you somehow code it to where the trees will naturally spawn like that? Because other wise I wouldn't want to chop them down!
Please add ores so we can download the map and then play survival minecraft with friends
Idea for a big projekt:  The  whole the legend of zelda botw map woth the titans and tje castle
absolute madlad
I’ve already commented, but I’m so glad this video got so many likes so I came back for round two!
Wow this is amazingly well made
WOW
*PC FPS HAS LEFT THE CHAT*
bro can we have the link to download this world please bro !!!!
You forgot about beetroot farm in the village! >:(
Gods I'm so excited for the world download. Awesome stuff man
bro can we have the link to download this world please bro !!!!
BEST MAP EVER  You forgot the swamp
U forgot to place Mansion in dark wood biome -_-
im a little worried about those stall villagers just getting killed by skeletons in a survival setting, but otherwise great work!
This is insane...
What would be epic to add is a secret redstone contraption that when triggered by a hidden button or lever, gradually spawns in a natural-looking survival base that has the basic resources you need, plus is aesthetically pleasing to look at.
Make a revin
living legend
How many days did you finish the biomes?
Is this ark
Next episode: upgrading the ENTIRE UNIVERSE survival friendly
Map Download?
Also will the world be free or will you have to pay minecoins
I have actually found a giant nether portal ruin in my world before I was so confused it was right there in the middle of the village
What about the nether? The end?
Woah can’t wait it’s absolutely amazing
Pls add mod (more bosses and monster) and more quest, like RPG games
you should make a custom nether too also this reminds me of middle earth it looks so so...so no words can describe how good it looks
Will there be a bedrock download?
Really waiting for the Wild West biom. Would love to play in that
What shaders do you use?
I want to watch the ads two times
teach me the ways of bulding master
Why u look like robot
Fantastic build! It still has that Vanilla feeling to it! Keep up the great work! 👍
I love how the Pillager outpost looks like a refurbished version of the farmers mill that you built later
This is one of the coolest maps I've ever seen
Would this be a patreon-exclusive map?
You should make a massive castle where is the stronghold
You should add subterranean secrets.
Make a ski resort or mountain in snowy biome that would be sick
I’m sorry. I have to say it.   When the shape of the map is sus
I NEED to download this map!!! where can i download it?
The ammount of effort he put into this for a 15 minute video apreciate it >3
Soo uhh.... Can we download the map?    No?       Alright then
you have 145k likes
Youtube recommendations are really on fire today. Is this gonna be downloadable?
and put it on a link so i can play
Maybe add a hidden cave in the mushroom island with giant crystals?
Can i just say, you just took Minecraft Open World Adventure to the next level  Basically turned it into a RPG-Theme(?)
this is 2 forgotten structure 1 : Igloo in snowy biome 2 : well in desert
Dude this made my day can’t wait for the next part
When you are the 800,000th viewer
You could work for minecraft with your skill
This whole awesome build summarized: If Minecraft had a BOTW worldpack
when can we download it?? best survival map!
what shaders do you use?
Why he don't have eyelash in 1 eye 🧐?
I was uninterested until you teased a Bob Ross reference. Now I’m all in...  Jk. Love your work man.
You could add a tornado that has destroyed a village
Cool
Brush your teeth bro
This is my new favourite YouTuber
is this java because i want to play this but i have bedrock edition can you make a bedrock edition survival world like this please
Maybe the different biomes could be different Kingdoms
hunger games vibe
THIS IS SO FUCKING SICK DUDE!!!
How did you make the Pillagers spawn naturally in the custom tower
I would pay $20 for this.
Saw this on Reddit!!!
What about the caves😏
I wanna see an smp on this. It looks amazing, keep it up!
Whenever I watch one of your builds my imagination starts running wild and I get so inspired. I'm not even a serious Minecraft player, nor do I play D&D (yet), or write, but this gives me so much inspiration and motivation to do so and to draw.
i can't wait to see the End City, and the Biomes in the nether
This needs more views!!!
Who else wants to play on this map and wants to shake his hand
You should put together a modpack that’s optional with things that you might think fit into your island
Wow that awsome do the nether to
when will be able to download this world
I need more than 15 min XD
I cant wait to download this map
do you take lessons from grian or something TELL ME YOUR SECRETS PLEASE
Mcpe please
I love the timelapse 🥰
Will it work for bedrock too?
perfect vidio
You could put all the flags of every courty around the world and as a goal find all of them
Looks insane! Can't wait to see where this goes.
So you mistakenly made the map 2x bigger and you kept it? I’m not complaining
80 k likes? huaa easy
This man needs to make a video game.
this is a real chad
I've never seen a video more deserving of a like
Make like an area in some mines that have fossils
At the dessert you can add a Giant Cat looking thing like in Egypt don't know what's it's called. In the mountains can you add an enormous mine with good ores. For the ocean you can add a very large pirate ship with some pirates I guess. Can you add a wooden mansion that looks like a Castle at the oak Forest or something. This my last recommendation for this video can you add a under water lost village like Atlantis then the a Kings Castle underwater or something.
The jungle should obviously have been next to the Savanna
I want to play a hardcore world on this world so badly that would be so cool
maybe you can build in the dark forest a fairy world and in the snowy moutains a dwarf kingdom
An abandoned fortress somewhere in the snowy mountains would be sick! maybe an upgraded stronghold could also be put into play
were did the woodland mansion go lol
Black plasma studios well use this map for there new animation i think🤔
YOU GOT OVER 80K LIKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You have forgotten the blacksmith
This is some good shit man
We need players up in here, who's up for some D&D style MRPG (Minecraft Role-Playing Games)?
Hmm… for the tundra biome you should create a huge dragon skeleton that is above land that leads into a huge cave with possibly a boss if you could add one. Idk your choice gl! Looks crazy already.
And idk if you have moose shroom island but pls do and something like wreckage or destroyed structures to add something like how did this island become full of fungus even the cow. It just add the mystery.
I think you should break the stairs on the portal a bit
Wait I have an idea for the spruce biome so maybe you could like make a path/road which will have wagons/trucks going to cut down spruce wood then bring the wood back to the village for more roofs that would seem cool Or you can maybe make a lumbering village which trades with the plains village. Maybe like food for wood since there arn't many food sources in the spruce biome.
Will you make this a downloadable map once finished? Would love to play
Im new here and just subscribed looks good and i have an easter egg suggestion how about a nuclear rocket silo .would be funny😄
i loved this and cant wait to see more
this is really cool
I wish there was a seed for this
I don't even play Minecraft. But... I might just start because of this.
An idea for the end portal You could put it in an hidden temple in the mountains or maybe put multiples in different hidden temples
This guy proves minecraft is more than just a block game. It's art.
Do a castle in plaines
Sick
HOW ARE YOU SO DAMN TALENTED, I WOULD BE MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH THIS ALONE
Am u forgot the iron golem
I would like to see you set the biomes according to the environment (4:15 you can see the farm freezing up, because minecraft wants there to be an icy biome). Worldedit is capable of that :)
This is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen😱
*we will watch your career with great  interest*
Imagine this as a hunger games map...
It would be realy cool if you could build roads between all villages so its all connectet or just some pathways leading to different places. im sooo hyped to see the endresult
in the wild west make tumble weeds and in the snowy mountains make giant snow men pls!!!!! this project is so cool, good luck!!!!😁😁😁😁😁
brush your teeth
This is what the game should be
Can't wait to get this download!
The villagers have never felt so happy for that upgrade
I suggest a datapack that replaces the vanilla tree with the new one when using sapling.
Will the nether and end also be custom?
I hope i could play on it with my friends! I rlly like it good job.
Can we appreciate the fact that he make and build all of this alone.
i just found out about you and i wanted to say that the transformations and the buildings that you make are absolutely beautiful. btw here's a suggestion: maybe you should make an underground hidden village in the mushroom biome or the dark wood biome
Can you please make it a map dowload
You should make a Zelda breath of the wild map
BRO YOU SOULD OF BEEN THE ONE TO MAKE THE MODLES FOR MINECRAFT!
Make a survival video
80k likes? Its over 100k already lmao
When I see you build, it looks like you copy and paste things onto the island you work on , how can you do that and does it work on minecraft Java?
I'm exited for the day when being able to decently download and load this map a bit slowly would make your cpu be considered crappy trash tier
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .

This is such a cool idea that I can’t wait to download the map
for me the main fun I find in MC is going on pointless adventures that end up taking me through weird places, like going to find a stronghold and finding bees, a shipwreck and a giant nether portal on the way, so this maps looks like it would be a lot of fun when going through one of these adventures and finding maybe a treasure map or a lost town and such
I know you are going for a village that kinda resembles the vanilla version, buuuut it could look more alive if you tried the TekTopia villager mod. I think it would look more alive... but idk, then it also pushes away from normal good ol' vanilla......  I really liked the video by the way
Add a massive glacier at the snowy biome and have a temple built inside of it,kinda like a dungeon with secrets and such
Graveyard behind church
How do you download this
80k likes Day later 100k
i want you to possibly add  an abandod village near the first village in the plains os the next village your making
looks so cool! would love to see some difficult to traverse paths towards the jungle villages with very dense forests and like parkouring (for example tree stems to cross a river or waterfall
Idea: You could do like a tree or shonthing that is a entrance to a BIG cave or a under ground world
Will it end with we Can download the world
Great build! I'm excited for more!
what we see what TrixyBolx sees
Can't wait for people to download the map and improve the nether and the end
I wanna download this
In the jungle add a abandoned hospital
Idea for the snowy village: make it abandoned with diaries inside saying things like "We might have to leave soon, the storm is getting closer by the day".
Please build a drowned town. 😁
If the snowy mountains don't get a elsa ice castle ima be suprised
Moreeeeeee
this is just the fortnite map in season 7
Add a Cross to the Church.
who think mojang should hire this guy?
Petition for him to be in dream smp
Hé, i saw you on reddit! Cool!
I think it would be cool if you will add a ruined empire theme on the mushroom biome or a ruins of a ship battle under the water somewhere
Could you build a big TRex or Dragon skeleton in a cave deep down in the snowy mountains pls?
already at 141k likes in 1+ day
What if it was a kind of adventure story game.. you have to go all around and get pieces obsidian or doing different quest, then you like fight the wither or something as a final boss. As a reward for killing him you get a diamond pic!! Once you get to the nether you beat the game!! That would be soo cool!!!!!!
Id buy the plain map for like $25.00 like holy shit calling this amazing is an understatement
because of this, I have now realised I would love to see a project where you transform minecraft into Breath of the wild T_T
you should’ve ask for 100k likes
pls make a seed
Mojang should hire you
this map will become so amazing, you are the best
Try to include abandoned houses or campsites in the wild and I think u need to make the forests really dense and confusing, make it really immersive
Mojang should hire this man like damnnnn
Mojang should notice this
you gotta make an underwater fossil that you can swim into that reveals a cavern
Do you actually decorate inside of the houses?
Where map? Where download?
This is a pure awesomness
We need this online like a multi-player map!
It got more than 80k likes so cant wait for part 2
It would be very cool if someone make a minecraft story mode mod based on this map
you wanna idea? make a whole new game! :)
modpacks would fit this banger
I can't wait to play on this map
Very impressive chief 👏 can't wait for the next biome 👌
but where is the download link or is there not one?
Sheesh
And even better then netherite can be found in the nether and piglins will be your service forever and give the most op stuff ever when you give them ruby
you should add the create mod for windmills and things to move and look cool:)
Try add like an arena in mushroom island where you have to fight the wither there
emagian mojang see this.how many days they do this.
I CANT WAIT ago so this with my friends
Dude wants 80k and gets 140k
This makes me sad minecraft just completly broke for no reason just yesterday.
Part 1?
Maybe place a little cave somewhere on the planes in refernce to the cave you find after beginning botw
I can't wait to see the rest of this project. Wow!! The inspiration I got from this video alone is crazy, so I really can't wait to see what else is in store!
Are you gonna add some custom mob to the map?
Can't wait until the battle royal version to be released, lol
Can you add a ruby monstrosity to the mesa biome mines and ruby ore very very very very very useful but very very very rare to find
You said you'd release the full map when it's done, but could you maybe release the map with untransformed structures too? I'm absolutely terrible at building, but it'd be interesting to compare my builds to what you'll do with it.
I need this map
Id the map for Bedrock
Imagine if this project combined with the YouTuber   Daniel Krafft  Redesigned  Mobs series
It should be in bedrock also plssssss I a 14 year old
Who else saw this on Reddit?
imagine adding so much mods onto this
After everything is created the fire nation will attack
how about do a dwarven kingdom?under the mountain?The Hobbit inspired build
Map looking aus
Please do custom caves!!!
Try to make this but modded.
Just curious, you said you updated everything, but I don’t see others lands except plain that got updated, others just Minecraft style.
A castle for were the king of the lands used to live Or a dragon dungeon with the ender dragon egg as the prize in the center
Can someone do the math and see how many level 4 maps it will take to make a full map of the entire island
Make sure to get this to 80k likes  Gets 140k one day later
Mojang better hire you
Bro that legit looks like wano from one piece
U should look for mods that can add mobs to the world
Please create a ruined piglin themed village/Camp near the ruined nether portal
On the planes biom you didnt add tge birth forest
Mojang should be taking notes!
Holy cow! This is amazing!
Idea : make underwater cave castle that have massive room of end portal also only can enter from underwater cave
Woah saw this on Reddit sweet
This is insane
🤫
This is the biggest project I’ve ever seen on Minecraft after 1/1 earth
:D
i saw this poston reddit
Loved your video ! For the taiga biome you could take inspiration from Read Dead Redemption 2 and especially the small town of Strawberry ! Keep making great videos !!
Minecraft needs to hire this guy
Who else thinks him and jeracraft should team up😂🤔
I haven't touched Minecraft at all since 2017, left behind all the youtube videos, and out of nowhere this video got recommended. Pleasant surprise, as I'll definitely be waiting for more videos of this project.
Thank you for trapping villagers for me.
RPG
Mojang should take some ideas from this!
Me: makes house*  Trixy: hold my beer
This dude is making my dreams come alive
You have a girlfriend?
Its almost like the land of ooo
There's a stronhold there?
Mine dead redemption!!🔥
This video, only a fifth of the way through, has singlehandedly earned my like, sub, bell, and com.
i love all the smaller builds you should do more of them!
Can’t wait!!!!!
Daaamn, this is sooo awesome. Trixy be making my childhood dreams come true. I really can't wait for the finished build and the lore behind it. Congratulations on 1 million subs man, you deserve it!
This feels like Clash Of Clans
This feels like Clash Of Clans
This feels like Clash Of Clans
"this is still quite small to how I usually build" my man I don't evenknow how to build a decent looking house
Maybye a sump
You can make a massive tree in the middle of a village
Mojang should hire you to upgrade all the vanilla structures my dude.
I don't know how or why, but i just felt really good while watching this
Epic
This was so awesome keep doing things like this
OMG, so goooood, keep it up man. Can't wait for the other biomes
Idea: add a Secret mineshaft in the badlands
Where can I download this map it is so cool.
Imagine One of the secret is rickroll
This is dope trixy awesome work
Will you have a massive cave as well?
Wow! Thats so amazing and your channel is so underrated!
6:53 "dummies, you dummy"  :/ sus
Hey u posted this on reddit

I have an idea for an addition! What if we had a stronghold but like bigger with mines like a secret lair then an abandoned End city temple Trixy hope you see this and good luck sir
Can't wait for the next video
Mojang needs to hire you
Minecraft 1.19 World Update 🤣😂
Anyone else think the map looks like wano
hold up wait a minute are you gonna do the nether???
Loving this! It has almost doubled in likes from your request, you deserve it!
Why can't Mojang do stuff like this????
Can we have a secret library in a structure in the dark oak forest
YOOOOO! THAT'S SO AMAZING! ✨
I saw this on reddit
80,000 Likes for part 2? we passed that in 3 days Noice, Me you and everyone that sees this video. we did it now lets wait for the next part
can you make the map free?
6:40 I can see my self being hit off the edge already smh
Bob Ross go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Me not knowing anything hes saying nodding my head yes
This looks like 100 player pvp map
I swear if he puts this behind a patreon paywall I'm gonna be so annoyed
can we just talk about how insane this is? i never would have imagined someone building such a massive custom map
woah this is insane
Where is the map download link?
You won a new notidication squad sub, also how do i download it? Is it for bedrock edition or java?
I want you to be a god to edit this world
Is tis Minecraft?
Bro how does your PC you know... not blow up while recording and editing this world with shaders/optifine on?
Trixy I think you should make it to where you buy the download for like 5 bucks just to support your channel
I think its still to empty
Trixy: 80k likes for map?  Us: 138k take it or leave
Hey trixy i was wondering that when you are done with this map, can you make an alternative way for the public to play it other than your patrion cause people like me who have parents that do not let us pay for these websites could actually play this p.s i love this map
It would be cool if you made a bustling kingdom
PLS give Save!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Or that World to play survival
I don’t know why but before I heard your voice I always thought you were a girl
N o i c e
this is a secret bionicle island
A pilliger vs village sean
n o i s e
6.9K COMMENTS XD
is there a download for this map?
By the time he finishes this project he will celebrate 2M subs
Would love a secret herobrine portal or something.
Where swamp
Mojang should hire you!!
after all why not, why not just subscribe
How about having a giant center mushroom with a village in it. That could give the player some incentive to go there other than infinite mushroom stew from mooshrooms.
Alright now i want this but in Terraria
Yo Trixy! You should upgrade the stronghold when ya get a chance! Been waiting for something like this and now it’s happening. CONGRATS ON 1 MIL
Done >80k likes
Do a swamp between the dark wood and Rain forest🌳, or in the mushroom biom
What about the ores etc
Is It posibble to Download this?
Is this for bedrock to? So not can you do something like this for minecraft bedrock to?
I want you to remake "fallen kingdom" next also fallen kingdom is name of place and name of song made by captainsparkles
Would be nice to find a village in the nether, not with pigmen but, villagers. *Backstory intensifies*  You could upgrade them and choose them so their trade options will be worthy of a journey in litteral hell.  My apologies for the potentially bad english of mine.
How can I download this?😟
I love your build no creations please build more like this but more like a contenents with each bioms to larger ones like this please
Omg! Cant wait to see all this and later use this map! Good luck :)
Maybe for the ruined portal more of a broken stairway design? You are the greatest!
what shaders are you running my man?

Damn, if a genie appeared in front of me right now, I'd wish for normal Minecraft to look this good.
I can't wait
Idea: Make a normal survival base in any of these areas, transform that, put a nether portal in the base a transform that specific part of the nether
Minecraft should hire you to build worlds.
Can't forget the nether and the end.
Hey there, amazing video! I really loved it, but I really would really like it if you were to make a modpack that copies all these features so that I can play it more than once :) Thanks!
Please do a series on how to use world painter I’ve watched many before however they don’t seem to go in depth enough on how to do something like you do
add MORE AND MORE AND MORE MOBS
Best viddo in WORLD !
*I love you too*
only 4 minutes in - my jaw (literally and fugitively) dropped!
I am a bit late but how about the shroom biom beeing really mystical
Maybe try doing the end biome on an island or the nether biome on an island
This is cool but I just wanna know if there is an interior
Never gonna give you up
make a epic tronghold
9:20 to 9:28 look at the lama

Yo pls get this out it is so cooooooool
Imagine how laggy this world is

When the New fake fortnite map leaks:
Maybe you can transform the dream Smp
mojang needs to hire you
This is friggen epic bro, what program did you use to make the map?
Can't wait for it to be finished!
You should try to recreate the nether once you’re done with the overworld
I saw this on reddit and wanted to download it. I cant wait!
This map will be my new ww1 map
Trixy planting trees: *MRBeast is happy*
dammmmm
this is absolutely crazy! wonder if you're planning doing something cool with nether/end as well
Can we get this just for survival Edit: context is no quest just survival Also tbh I would just live in the village  House
Can u make a Redstone village.
Wow
I hope you make it downloadable
W
I am happy when I finished a Block House without roof!
I cant even build a symmetrical house with good aesthetic using 150+ blocks.
That was crazy😅 ...
Jerra craft colab PLSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
This is some amazing work! You truly are a talented one 😆
Please make it a free world download .
Dude you are so talented, keep up the amazing work
Cathedrals can be small and churches can be big. I belong to the choir of a church that regularly gets confused for the city's cathedral by outside visitors.
Where can i download this map
Make a secret buried or crashed space/futuristic vessel (a submarine or space ship would be amazing)which can add to the future of the storyline .
Timestamps for the different biomes would be cool
When the island is sus
A secret fnaf area/pizzaria pls
Hey *MOJANG* can you add him to make your generations, he seems to be GOOD!
Make the  wano country in  minecraft pls
Mojang and Microsoft, take notes
When is the second biome video coming out? .
Alternate title I made rl craft in vanilla minecraft
I’m excited for more!
AMAZING
GG im subscribing👍
epic!!!
You should add a hidden underground city in the Mesa or mountains
Amazing
in the messa biome i would love to see a giant skeleton slightly burried on the groung like crocodiles in water but with a dinosaur skeleton
It should have a huge cave,  with a lot of valuable ores and some treasure.
He deserves more than like & subs. 😲
I hope to play in this world one day.
What's the seed
Can we get it for bedrock
Imagine someone would do a nodded series on this
oh my god looking amazing. If only I had a pc that could run that decently haha
It’s so beautiful I can’t wait for episode 2 your amazing at this
This crazy design, i love it
I can't wait 4 part 2
You should put a village pillage hut in all biomes as a mini boss battle and then do a large boss battle in another way
Ay as a secret put an island out far away like doom island or something
I wonder if you can make some "upgrades" in the Nether and End
I'll wait for the part 2, keep it up.
I love this so much! Can't wait till you open it up for the public to download.
this look very good
u got 100k likes in a day
yoooooooooo this is epic! I can't wait to see more! Congrats on 1 mil! you honestly deserve it!
so is it just me or does his other eye look like the eye you draw when u screw up the other one.
saw this map on reddit didint know u had yt channel lol
Where can i download it
how can you not like this guy, , massive respect bro
I can only just imagine mrbeast Gaming use this map for his challenges
Mate, this gives so much vibe, so much inspiration and so much encouragement to restart building in minecraft!
Hey Trixy can u make a mobile link of this map plz  . Thanks!
Truly a masterpiece
anyone else get Bionicle land vibes? XD
are you going to add a working end portal?
This is one of the most beautiful things i saw in a long time. Im speechless.
the viligers must be happy
Actually could you do Ewoks/crashed falcon in the desert....some sort of Star Wars Easter egg?  Comment your ideas
8:46  this is a good  example of what the netherlands looks like XD
Dream reacts this also dream:interesting map i hope i can beat the 5 hunters by usin this place hunters:oh shit here we go again
Could we do a panther for black panther!  Or an Indiana Jones reference in the jungle biome
My man doing it every since he was born
This is impressive! Will you do the nether and end as well?
Him: Lets add a tiny bit of change to the map. Me: Nice he is adding stuff. *blinks* Him: *makes the entire universe in 1 second* Me: WTF
DO IT FAST! I WANT TO PLAY IT SO BAD!
I would like to ask u how much time was taken to make this project
Imagine an rlcraft type mod with this map, it would be soo amazing to play in, as well as making it a server for other players, i would love to play that
It's gonna be pretty boring to play actually
If only the default minecraft is this detailed
hope u actually finish this project and this isn’t just hype for 1 video i hope this is as dope as we all hope
Will you be customizing the other dimensions too?
So... You almost make a Mata Nui island
Somebody, call Mojang rn
You should definitely make this map a quest map and the final quest is to fill in the portal by going around the map and completing smaller quests
You should have made a swamp
Mushroom biome make a mushroom castle 🏰
illuminati desert pyramid
I can’t believe this legend only has 1 m subs i have watched you since 300k subs.
Is it going to be available for bedrock edition?
How to download the map?
Man if I knew how to build like this then........ wow
Build far lands somewhere far from the island and dont tell us where u built it Just leave some hints that can tell us where to go
I am just Wow'ed
you can do the end portal in a dragon temple, the idea is like a past religion that venerate the end dragon and the temple is a way to stay more closely to their "god"
you can ad a villige in a cliff and I realy like the idea of the jungle
I am looking forward a lot to part 2, this is a amazing map so far. Maybe there could be a overgrown cliff in the sea with a jungle temple in the jungle area, like you could implement it a bit from the jungle temple transformation video but a bit smaller to fit with the vanilla feeling of the map. Maybe also a huge skeleton in the desert or the snowy mountains, since you mentioned taking inspiration from BOTW?   Will this map be available for free once its complete?
Inside?????????
Hey, could you make this with rpg support? (meaning that me and my friends could play with a rpg modpack?) So some storyline and a lot of villagers towns would be great. The mods itself is not a problem. Only the builds!  Thanks
I will definitely be looking forward to this :)
You are insane
a day old and it already has over 80k likes
Its look like an rpg
An underground ice cave system for the ice mountains could be cool
if the map is finished, is it for free to download? it would be SO NICE!! you're one of the best Minecraftyoutubers I know (sry for my bad english, i'm from germany)
133k in 1day You're rocking maan ❤️
this is literally a map for like RPG games
this is the most amazing thing i have ever seen
Where can one download the map? Fantastic work.
Trixy... dude... you're the BEST map creator I've ever seen!! I love how you created an entire world with it's own lore, that is SO amazing! Keep going man, you're god tier!
just noticed its made yesterday
Is the map out yet? I wanna play this with my friends
Now I want to see that but without shaders
Imagin this being your hardcore survival map
Will you upload this for free or will you lie like in the other video?
Art
Minecraft: Breath of the wild
what card does he use ????
You Are Insane ReCreating A Whole Minecraft Map!!!
Two things. Frozen waterfall lake in the mountains. Also, maybe you can add like tracks from one village to another. Since there will be travelling merchants/clerics, wouldn't there be a well worn track that they follow because it's safe? Like it's not really a built rode, just a line on the ground that doesn't grow that much grass around it anymore because of the number of times people travelled through them.
This guy have 1 million but he deserves way more he’s still underrated in my eyes This is sooooo damn coool
Hello mr trixy can you do the mines of moria from lord of the rings?
Hi! Loving this, but are you gonna recreate the nether and the end too?
yesssssssssssss
chuck us a download
You should totally do the Nether!!!!
Add some ruins ib the map for an adventure felling. (^.^)
ohh shit that was fast 80000 likes lool
*Mind blownnnn*
What about the nether? Or the End? Also anybody tell you you look like kit Harrington
Wow
Its like ark genesis but minecraft version
your insane!!!
This is amazing! It will be cool to see this with the caves update, you should go under the terrain when caves is released!
Can you please provide the map for download or make a data pack with which the new structures and newly designed biomes can be generated in a newly created world?
Amazing. Just amazing. Keep up the great work
I- I'm to lazy to do only one detalized building I'm not gonna comment that
You asked for ideas so what about for the disputing jungle tribes. Ones a ground village and ones a village in the trees and they are just fighting because they are trying to figure out who owns the trees.
God damn! You just earned a sub!
Are there going to be ores ?
"80k likes" theres 30k left! For it to being doubled!
Genie: 3 Rules ~No wishing for death ~No falling in love ~No bringing back dead people Me: Make me a good at building things in minecraft Genie: ......................  .  .  .  There are 4 Rules.
you should make the Ruined Nether Portal the spawnpoint
i bet you a 1000$ that people are gonna do hardcore Minecraft on this world
Please add like a main boss arena and an actual boss to the area like a boss progression now that would be fun and challenging
Give it  for free please

World download?   (I'm a new subscriber)
a mention of herobrine would be so cool for the lore, maybe a mineshaft that just have red stone lights like how people used to show “oh my god herobrine was here” a lil silly but it’d be so cool
Bro what about the woodland mansion ?
Anyone else notice the "dummies, you dummy" text?
Wouldn’t trolls and Elbs fit better than the Wild West
hey, when is the download coming out? love ur work btw :D
Where can i download the world?
You earned a subscriber buddy. Its crazy how much work you put in one video
Minecraft
Mojang be like: when you try your best but you don’t succeed
This is so good bro sure got yourself a subscriber
Legend
A single random chest on literally any possible block even capable of being placed under snow that's packed full of pumpkin pie, no restrictions of where this chest can go
If someone can make a mode that can grow custom trees out of saplings that would be awesome
I've never been so impatient to see the rest  Why didn't this pop up in my recommendations 2 months latwr
Can I get your seeds
This gave me inspiration to build my own version but smaller btw i love how u build

Minecraft:overworld update
Looks like land of wano
You gain a new subscriber, hope to see more of this project 🙈
⭐Amazing⭐
Can you please add Sonic The Hedgehog on the Snowy Biome instead of the Big Foot. hehe
Man this is insane, you could add other easter egg like other game, movie, or even youtuber
Congratulations on the 1 mil man, you should definitely make some ancient skeletons of behemoth creatures. Love the vids
Dwarf kingdooommmmmm
UNDERGROUND KINGDOM!!!
You should collaborate with a mod programmer who would implement your buildings in the world generation
A temple on top of a snowy mountain, and possibly some cool mines! A custom end and nether would be amazing too. Great work btw :)
😲I want that

Strong hold please
that's a gigantic open world
can we all play in the server
This is so awesome
how can I get the map?
80 k likes..the video crossed it...so when u give us the world.??
Brooo i got an idea do a mosque in the desert it would be so cooool 🙂👌👌👌
You are so Creative person!!
Well, this youtube channel is underrated He deserves more subscribers
Would love to see u do something with the hermits on hermitcraft
I love this sooo much
This bedrock too?
it would be nice if there were spawners in the pillager outposts so they can spawn back
anyone else think that the mushroom island needs a giant mushroom battle tower in the middle or something like the or is that just me. Because I think that would look absolutely amazing.
Where's le shreks swamp?
I cant wait bro cant wait
I don’t get why Mojang don’t just hire him to rebuild the whole of minecrafts structures cause they would get so many positive responses
You could add a black market and/or a tower.
You should work for mojang because this is amazing
YOU JUST MADE A BATTLE ROYALE MAP
Nether next
There should be a time traveler lurking around the map and he has hidden journals, there should also be abandoned campsites around the map. Oh, and a giant fossils and a giant skull of godzilla. Edit: And there should be a giant mountain on the snow biome (like mount Everest), on top of that mountain there should be a big sword standing on the ground, and that sword was used to kill godzilla.There should also be deep ravines
What'd be cool is a datapack that grew the custom trees from saplings
Algorithm go brrrr
i saw this in reddit since i got a notification didn't know it was trixyblox
I have a little idea for the mushroom island. BC why not make a mysterious cave or raveen just to make it more worth exploring.
I sometimes think the landscape is almost like a modded Minecraft landscape but it’s more beautiful tho
Dude is literally making a new zelda series
Man it already 100,000 likes
Is this exclusive to Java or could you access this seed in Bedrock?
It would be a good idea to build a illager or pillager casel in snow and strong hold under it and they keeping it safe it also helps in story that they are trying to access the end with beasts around the biome.
In the desert or snowy mountains you could add large fossils like in Breath of the Wild
Wow, I feel inspired! Thank you!
Is there any chance that we could download it ?
Upgrade desert temple ,jungle temple and all you have upgraded in this map and include new adventures and chests for loot
Looks like Millenium falcon from star Wars
Man this map was vast  Didn't think horse was enough
will it be available for bedrock edition?
Idk if it’s possible but you should try make a mod that replaces everything to your builds
Dude, you need to put this avaliable.
Very Nice Build! try to build a massive zombie apocalypse build with a huge zombie build
a pewdiepie and mrbeast village/nation and a tommyinnits abandoned house where you will have a quest of finding the disc of tommy
i think the windmill could uses a tiny bit of ascents for example green terracotta
I was wondering if you could kind of combine a pillager Outpost, woodland mansion and a village. I was thinking you could probably put the pillager outposts on like each of the four corners of the woodland mansion and have the village surrounding the bottom of the woodland Mansion.
Your village is so small
i hope this will be for the 1.16.5 version, also when you finish all the biomes, you could then start with the nether, i also hope there will be like a story to this world, that would be cool
Pls do this map for free because it’s a 1mio Special
This is fricking insane
Surely the upgraded pyramid, jungle temple and end stronghold get implemented. Those things were way too amazing to not be featured in this world. This whole worlds gonna look amazing when it's finished
DUNGEONS DUNGEONS DUNGEONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE THE VID AND YOU
I want to paly this map this is my favourite map ❤️❤️
Will there be a bedrock edition world download?
If there were villagers in different biome, I would like to be called like this: Plain Village Mesa Town Jungle Tribe  Desert Uhh... something  Ocean palace Dark wood Coven, or swamp And out of ideas
129k likes 277 dislikes. Damn
you should make a UFO in the back of the snow mountains out to the water :)  And one more thing... This looks so FUCKING good!!! You really nailed it!
Waiting for world for getting download
U should make a custom dungeon for every biome or something like That to make it more interesting to play in survival
I wish thes was a seed in minecraft I meam its amazing!!!
Mojang needs to hire this guy to build stuff
Imagine this is the vanilla minecraft structure in 2025
How abt Winterfell for the snowy mountains??
I don't understand why Mojang has such elementary-looking village houses how difficult would it be for Mojang to hire someone to make better models??
Petition to get trixyblox to guve world download
It would be cool if you could create a slight nether area from the main portal, like a piglin village
Custom village trades would be so cool! Maybe an evil cult has settled in the stronghold.
I would guess a skyrim map would br epic
will villagers actually use all the stuff? I thought they ignored player-built structures?
Please release this as a map
Bruh, I cant wait but I must.
I am amazed :0
Will the different buildings and towers have spawns for correct entities?  Like a fisherman guaranteed in the fish house, pillagers spawn in the towers?
Bro, don't forget the swamp and the witch's lair please 🙏🙏
Wow thats good building skills 👏
take my MONEYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
Damn i remember playing a online MMORPG game and the map looks like this.
I can't wait for the finished thing oh my goodness! Please keep up the lovely work!
First time on this channel, and I can say, mmm, someone is won
80000? mate it's almost 139k!!
This looks incredible! I can't wait to see how this will turn out! 😄
Can yuo put this into mcpe and send a doanload
I have a question pls reply: is u release the world download can we install that to a server and play with friends?
oh man... this is so cool! I wish we could download it, but i understand that it will probably be EXTREMELY laggy
I kinda wanna see a nether build like this
will you also be upgrading the nether?
I think you should add some  lava pools in th Mesa  Snow pit traps in the tundra  Quick sand in th desert and lastly some  ocean ruin
I cant be the only person who does get satisfied by minecraft timelapses, but especially so with this one
I have q name for the village it is* wulvenheim
I came I saw I subscribed
I NEED A VOLCANO on it
Can't wait for the world download! And I hope it will be also available on bedrock or pocket.
I'm hype for the next transformation!!
how about Orzemar from dragon age i think this epic and also this map is beautiful fantasy vibe patch minecraft so well
My man you should have a hidden village that you can only find if you solve a riddle that tells you were it is
Bro, wynncraft is calling you, check your emails.
I feel like an ice cave would look nice for the snowy moutains
One of the secrets should be a abandoned graveyard
Beautiful…
Great job!
Maybe a good idea but have a tunnel system running through all the bioms and that also counts for a 2 for one because cool tunnel and lore.
THIS IS THE BEST WORLD EVER, i hope we can download this one for free without having to pay on patreon because my parents dont allow me to do that
So basically this guy made Catan in Minecraft right!!!
Make a lava pit in the plains biome and a hidden boss chamber with a lot of mobs and maybe make a few quick sand pits in the desert biome.
Challenge updated the nether
I would be so happy if i can build just one of the buildings he made
I think you need more house when ?you look  on the size from the church
i subscribed and you have to make map public😁
you should recreate a luminescant moon in the sky or a sun if you would prefer
Plz make all the marketplace stalls have different colors on the cloth
Can you also add asta's village hage from black clover pls
I can’t wait for the other biomes I’m so excited
Can you also add asta's village hage from black clover pls
how does someone get as good at building as this guy, wtf!?
i would plant a few more trees in the plains biom That would be very cool
Your eyes
Mojang got to take notes
I feel like a plains biome would have a mobile cattle farm like the ones in brazil or alaska. I realkse these are completly different but oh well
Imao what if u added volcanoes and put villages on volcanoes and put vaults in some villages + Mojang should hire u :)
Mojang be like: This is our inspiration to update every biomes in minecraft!!!
Id love to see trixyblox in hermitcraft.
This is amazing
He should not pay Mojang to add all of this, Mojang should pay him
Should have a secret give away treasure
It feels like his eyes are staring at me, but he himself isn't
Put a abandoned Herobrine  Temple or shrine of sorts. I think that would be pretty cool.  Also dude, you are frickin incredible. Keep up the good work man.
When you release this map to download
Imao I think it would be better without the quarry
I can officially say I have seen this man evolving. From the pewdiepie base transformation till this one, oscar never fails to suprise me. you sir are what I call a crazy mad man, keep going.😃🔥🔥
This sounds dope!
I saw this on reddit
You are a legend bro
I would be really cool if there was a dragon nest in the mountains
Its F2P map plz?
a big dwarvin like mine (kinda like Moria) in the snowy mountains would be cool
Where was the bell located?
Is there a way that this could be on bedrock?
Just do it
There's must be part 2 this
I have one question: if its in world painter is there ore distribution and caves as that is a very important part of survivalf
Maybe you can add a wich Castel that have dungeons that vilagers  are trapped in and the wich is trying to rule the island  and like maybe you can make a story' too  defeat the wich idk
Noice
Will you be making any improvements to ender portals/ the end?
How does he just draw the whole map? And just copy and paste things into the world?
Instagram.com
This looks amazing. Good job!
Trixy:The plains villagers are strictly vegetarian  Also Trixy:Adds fisherman’s house
you can crosses in the church
All my hands are down you win I can’t i give up I try to beat you in my head
1 day and it's 130k lmao
Completely stole @TheMythicalSasuage’s video. You even copied the farm
How do I get the map for myself tho
:0 wow this might be the most amazing content by Trix Thank you for making this video I'll make sure to hit the like button
You should be in hermitcraft
Instead of I giant campfire chimney I’d put a torch haha
oh wait it is the 21 nerver mind
YouTube recommendations didn't disappoint me today
is there another part
Holy shit, if this doesn't get you a job at mojang, I don't know what will. This looks incredible
You get a sub because this looks like from a very cool game I think minecraft should hire you for designing structures and the others should make it that they can really use it
Pls make it free download 😔
You should make the dark forest into smurfs houses!! Plsssssssssss!!!
I love love LOVE this! Do more like this!
The whole island looks *sus.* >_>
Transform jungle biom
Idea: add real animals that aren't in Minecraft we're you think they would live
u said u wanted to do a botw style r u planing to make the hyrule castle in 1 build ?
more, more, more!!!
Can't wait to make a survival world on this!!!
“inspired by botw” that made me happy
that was cool
I would absolutely love to play this, and I'm big on good ol' survival, so you're definitely doing well my dude! Absolutely love the work so far!  Also, by the low chance of you seeing this, I would like to suggest maybe making smaller places where people can restore or build on to something there (ruins, basic structures, or just little natural places) and look at what different types of players would do in this world (like wanderers who live off the land, challengers who face big feats, and builders who settle and develop places).
Downloads map* PC blows up 😐*
Whats worldpainter?
Couldn’t u just redo the programming of mc and change all the designs 4 the structures like villages to spawn normally but look like ur design
Will there be a bedrock download or just Java?
You know wild west town
THIS IS INCREDIBLE!! I'm so excited to be able to play this map someday and I loved watching the building process! Can't wait to see more progress videos!
Ok why's this guy not hire in mojang?
You could transform a shipwreck on the coast of the plains biome
When ur done u should do the nether and the end :)
Job well done Mr. Trixyblox!!❤️ I suggest your own version of an Attack on Titan walls  map. A lot would probably wanted to see such build.
+
THIS LOOKS SO SICK AND I CANT WAIT TO DOWNLOAD IT
bedrock ver?
Why did you not do a swamp biome
well this be available on pe and bedrock
firstly i thought that was a fortnite map lmfao
How can I download this map?
Bro why is the map amongus?!?!?!?!
I'm always jealous of these talented people so I never watched their videos, but now that I saw his ideas and story, I subscribed and kinda wanna see how it plays out.
Its like a Warcraft
The villagers seems to be enjoying their new village
Cactus on snow????
Make part 2
It’s be so cool if you revamp a coral reef
The map looks like it could be from a Minecraft hunger games
The problem with the water freezing from when you added the vanilla village how will you fix it? I think thats related to the biome you are in
I have a question.. Will Pillagers actually spawn in the Outposts?
U ARE GENIUS!!!
How are u soo good at building
First village gives me Assassin’s Creed vibes
Cannot wait for this world download!! How long would it take to run across the entire world? Or just one biome even??
Trixy! You should make one BIIIIG Tree right in the middle of one of the Biomes!
Give this man a medal!🎖
Love how he said 80k likes and he got 124k likes in 2 days
if u made the villager meat eater then u can make a butcher
Names: Olympus, Noah’s Ark, God’s Garden, Thymescira’s Brother, Titan II, Odyssey
This man is a banger can you make a large mystical custom tree like in my neighbor  totoro
Trixy!!!! Your back dude Ive been waiting for your uploads. Great vid as always. I know you have a life and all, but you really need to feed my addiction and upload more often 😅😁 80 000👍 here we go....
I’ve been binging game of thrones and I would love to see a ruined kingdom like castlery rock that shows the scorched aftermath of a Great War
"Any professional builder cant live without spruce wood"  -me

You be like- making custom map  Me be like- making map but on a dream
Once this becomes available for download will there be ore in the ground for players in survival?
The vigorous pot postsurgically melt because george willy arrange excluding a enchanted study. elfin, mindless pull
custom end and nether would be hella nice but that’s just me :0
@TrixyBlox Reposting comment by Black Winter because i really want you to see it: The Mooshroom island should totally have an elven vibe to it, it fits so well with all the mushrooms lol
Make a stronghold!!!
"80k likes for part 2" bruh you got 123k likes in just a day.  And this is truly what we call God tier creativity.
Wow! Your so talented from creating Minecraft biomes! 😲
Where download, This is what we have been missing in the stock community,
imagine having 10 builders like this dude. building on that map
maybe add some mods that would allow you to add conversions between you and the villagers and things like that or some commands maybe I mean you can also feature other youtubers who can help with them if you don't know much about I think that would be cool
I have an idea !  You could try to transform the maps of books into minecraft like warrior cats ! It would be amazing 👍
is it available on switch/bedrock
Forge labs should play this on hardcore when this build is finished
It's trixy I'm not surprised
Add these islands and each one has different hostile mob like zombies, skeletons,And somethings about four islands
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! make dripstone caves for cave generations
All I can think of is what if you add some mods to the world like dynamic weather, and dynamic trees. Even mo- creatures  Honestly Trixy's builds inspire me to want to learn how to make minecraft mods so I could add his ideas into minecraft
If there is a world download for this it would take hours to download
YO THAT WAS SICK!!!  my idea suggestion would be to maybe like add a statue or smthng of a legendary hero to fit into the backstory of the world
hhhhhhhuuuhhhh  WHAAA
Thx alot your builds are really great.. it gave me sooo many inspiration, idea's for builds
Hi I'm going to be ignored
Can you make this on bedrock
You fkin madlad holy mooshroom
Does it have caves?
idk if you see thi but pyramis in the desert
Really hope I can get this on bedrock
Minecraft: Ultimate Edition
Could you maybe share the seed?
whats the lofi song on the background called id like to listen to it
I don't want to say it because ppl will say I'm mean but it's true
It would be nice to see like a abondon military base/ secret governmental building in the snowy mountains :D
Mojang should hire Trixy
PUT 1 OBSIDIAN IN EVERY Pillager FORT IT WiLL BE COOL
He should join the hermitcraft 8.....  Yes yes he should....like everyone who wants him to
Make the mushrooms biome like an out cast island like the island of mystery vibe
will saplings that the player plants grow in to the costum trees?
I want this world so bad!!
OMG!!!
Swamp?
uhhhh I'll make a video game out of it once the map is finished
Part 2
I got an idea!  How about build a Sky Village around the Snowy Mountains. The idea is that each floating house will be attached together by plain bridges, each set of houses and builds are attached to a hot-air-balloon which could enable them to contentiously float. In the center of the village, their is a big rope that is attached to a giant hook hanging in a mountain which puts the whole village together without flying away. Their transportation to go up and down the village is by using elytras. That's the whole idea basically.
Og
You really make something that no one can make ❤️❤️❤️❤️ you are really inspiring
I haven't even gotten a minute in but this already has me hooked by that shot of the upgraded nether portal.  Edit: Oh my god that was amazing.
Maybe you can do each biome had different religions like plains might be Catholic and the mountains books might like a multi God thing
Minecraft seriously needs to hire him, he's so good at building! and his creativity is so inspirational.
This guy is SO talented!
It looks amazing but I have to say the village looks a million times more appealing to blowup. However I probably couldn’t without saving a copy first.
Upgrade  Upgrade  Don't go back
Brush your teeth
You should build an underground cave city. It could be fashioned out of cobblestone and stone bricks and could make a really good villager kingdom or pillaged kingdom it could have waterfalls and small patches of plant growth in the cave and I personally think it would look really cool. I know it’s quiet a big project but I believe it would add a lot of life to caves and would make for an all around great looking city.
Try make a secret dungeon where all the monsters spawn
you make so many amazing things and I'm blown away every time.
Time well spent
I really love to play on this world (. ❛ ᴗ ❛.)
Imagine Minecraft actually looking like this
I cannot wait to see the rest of this. It's absolutely beautiful so far.
I need to see more, great work
E
I love how the cart is are like five time bigger then the horses,like how could the horses even carry that thing
I would like to see a special hidden journal of a villager that once thought about "what goes beyond this world" aka this custom map. This journal will possibly lead to the 2nd map of this series if it ever becomes one :>
The Elders Scroll: Minecraft
Will this be Java or Bedrock or both?
Love it, you should make the mushroom biome like fantasy themed with bio-iluminecent(probably not how to spell it) colors in all kinds of hight variants.
This should be the new vanilla minecraft
Please world link
This is so cool and looks amazing
Day 2  Could you create a random person's dream house in minecraft.  Time_ARTS
Would be real cool to add an island biome to fill in the space around the mushroom biome. Or maybe a sky biome above the plains biome. Perhaps a sky island shaped like a horseshoe with a waterfall flowing down it's center. Maybe few small mountains and structures to add more character. Or just go with a spiral shape island. I dunno just spitting things, but probably not the build for it though.
Dude this is so awesome
In the future youtubers will start to play some lets playminecraft in this world.
Damn dude I don't really watch Minecraft videos like that your truly giving it a RPG simulation that it never had id wish for the developers at Mojang would pay to use some of your idea and help grow the Minecraft community with ur inspiration
Imagine Minecraft actually hired him?
love this so much ! you're easily one of the top minecraft youtubers in my book :) it would be so cool to see a sky island somehow incorporated into this build !!
You should add quests for this that would be so cool
The map shape is sus 🆘🆘🆘🆘 🆘⬜️⬜️⬜️ 🆘🆘🆘🆘 🆘🆘🆘🆘 🆘🆘🆘🆘
2030: I upgraded the whole world in Minecraft
Minecraft really needs to make a beekeeper profession. Just a villager who can trade honey, honey comb, flowers!
It looks like the fortnite map lol
Any dislikes are crazy people
Ok  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG8IUc5T-k4JC8GyFMRzIew
a castle in the snowy mountains
A problem about survival friendly maps is the use of blocks. For instance, if you use an anvil as decorations, players are going to use that anvil instead of crafting one.
i need it!
So cool
Ark Minecraft edition
The sand looks so white my head hurts
Yoooooo!i want to play on this sooooooo baddddddddd
Add I big cave system that may lead to a underground city
Wait where’s the download?
Hi i love your videos!! From Philippines 🇵🇭
RPG minecraft
That outpost is so BotW it's pretty cool
Don’t forget about doing underground biomes! That would be so cool
I love building and im really good at it and if i had the patience i could also do something like this but i get bored really quickly and dont have much friends that also like building so its a struggle for me to build big projects
You should do a map mystery called (The Murder of Shyra)
Will this be for everyone? Like without having to be part of ur patron?...just curious
I wish this is available in bedrock welp i have a pc that is really old and broken i dont have a pc and i wish i can play in this world lol
I’d love to see the end portal opening up in the ocean like your upgraded dungeon
Wow damn bro
Billion dollar project right there
You should make a real city in minecraft like; new york, london, havana, etc
Can’t wait for the winter biome
Oh boi, this guy is hella underated, he deserves 10M
What if you put the stronghold in the middle island? And make it look like the mushrooms have just grown around it
You should name a villager trixy blox
O.M.G. gg
yoooooo
Oh I loved this! Suggestion for the pillaged tower you can also use nether quartz ore so it looks like there are still bones in the meat.
I definitely will be downloading this map when its complete, and I do have a suggestion. A "shipwreck cove" or "pirate island" made up of ships attached to each other and populated by pillagers
Oh hell yes I've been looking for some spice and I've just found it. Thank u can't wait to see it all come together.
Include a JoJo reference 😜
Are pillagers going to spawn at their towers?
insane
Now This Movie World
Ngl, this guy should make a prison shell, or a full fledged prison, one to be made into one of those inescapable prisons, and the other just a normal prison, but just majestic to look at.
Put more abandoned sructures like a  Wodden hose in a middle of nowwhere or a ruins of a great empire in a form of crumbuling towers and a broken shed in the middle of a desert or a half burried badly super damaged vilage that is abandoned lol i have soo much idea  that i cant fit it in this coment
When this is done luke the notable needs to do 100 days on this world
i love stuff like this
How to stop my pc from doing boom
This is just mind blowing. U made me smile the whole video. ITS SO GOOD. When can we download it?
I know it's not terribly original, but an Indiana Jones-esque restyling of a jungle temple, complete with traps and all sorts of passageways, would be super cool!
Holy this is amazing
If i download this map ill never build my house is like the tree is better than my house lol im ashamed lol 😂
bedrock or java
You is god
You are beyond talented. To me making this kind of stuff in minecraft isn't just playing a game. It's using the limited resources you have to make a beautiful work of art
This is just an idea, but It would be neat if the the revamped ruined portal teleported you directly to a revamped nether fortress. Maybe even teleporting players to some of the nether structures like a bastion, or just the nether biomes in general. I think that would be a good way to go about it. Just a thought.
This might be a stupid question but I gotta ask lol. Will it be possible to play this map on Xbox One?
can't wait to see part 2 :D
Using breath of the wild as inspiration is 1000% big brain IQ
I’m thinking you could add something special to the mushroom island, like a mushroom tribe or a Primal Mushroom, bigger than the others.
Insane, honestly insane
Add a pickle and not a small one a huge pickle
Imagine dream being chased on this amazing map xD
Can you pls make a base for a goldrush town? i have a project to build a minecraft goldrush map but i need a base. thx MAx
80k = Part 2 Like Counter = 120k  Me: LETS GOO!!
Transform Pewdiepies newest house plz
I loved this, cant wait so see more
Well an idea that I can think of is a sort of underground system, stretching and spanning across the entire island, allowing for am intricate and customised cave system beneath
It would’ve been nice to see you do something for the golem
are you gonna build in the nether too?
Would it be free cuz you did so much work and it must have taken weeks or months
Thats bit too much for a village
Mojang:TAKE NOTES
Plz make a world download
Easter egg idea: "Created by Warren Robinett (not really)" written on a sign somewhere, This is a reference to adventure which is commonly known as the first game to have a Easter egg
COOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Kinda looks like amogus
11:30 Wandering traders: am I a joke to you
Bet just don’t make it a patron only map lol but good job your such s inspiration for building
do it in bedrock
In the dessert or miesa biome do a dragon skeleton sticking out of the ground, that'll be sick
Dang! That thing is way more realistic then the real ones
Amogus
People working in Mojang:  Right that down, RIGHT THAT DOWN!
I really want to play that map in real life♥️
They should make this the next 3rd life map
I'd love to see someone create a really cool adventure map out of this when it's completed. Seems like it could be a separate game altogether
Put this man in the Massive Builder of Fame
I know this is your build and you're doing all of the building by yourself but might I suggest working with a modder to help with npc ai? I'm not all that versed in the ways of code but I assume there is some way to change the ai of the npcs to make the villagers of certain professions go to the dwelling specifically made for them, maybe have their own custom dialogue to contribute to the lore of the map and work with that treasure hunt idea you mentioned, or many other possibilities. I know you're the building expert here but when it comes to making playable maps, interaction is the name of the game.
After watching this, I am REALLY looking forward to the rest of the biomes, and beyond😮😮
Idea:  The Bob Ross reference takes the form of a diary from a villager named Rob Hoss, who writes about teaching the village children to paint their surroundings and appreciate the gifts nature has granted them.
I love how true to the original buildings you are
Try converting the ice spikes forest into a village, by making guard towers out of the tall ones and houses from the small, thicker ones.
If this is 16,000,000 blocks + mega custom structures. I wonder whats the file size of this map.
Dude if you finish that many YouTuber will use that in modded or regular Minecraft vids
Bro please do the download in bedrock edition too
U should collab with someone who can do mods
Why does this look like  the map of “Creatures of Sonaria”
This Video deserve a Like. 👍👍👍👍
Make the nether portal more circular in shape not just the normal rectangle one
I-... ima build myself a new village bye y'all✌
My man really out here making a full on world, well done my good sir
The outpost is super lit.
I have a suggestion for the wild west town. You can probably add an RDR1 or RDR2 reference.
Wow awesome map
"Playable survival map" but I'm sure a lot of people (including myself if I download it) are just gonna explore in creative😂
:o
This is ph1lza level building. And that's fcking great
We will be watching your career with great interest.
mojang should hire this guy
Imagine this become a MMORPG survival  minecraft and there's epic item lol
Guess he got the 80 likes
Tutorial mode lives again..
The sands looks like snow XD
This is my favorite video you’ve made yet.
The villagers got some amazing houses while i stay in a square house 🤣🤣🤣
Nice
I think you should make a...  A fortress/temple/dungeon with an op item at the end (by op I mean like crazy sword that does like 10 damage, is unbreakable, or something like that). You could make the outside bedrock and make it so that the people inside have mining fatigue (so we can't cheat). there are many ways you could add in the temple so feel free to have fun with it maybe even connecting it to a already existing temple of hidden in a "useless" well. The fortress/temple/dungeon could have like puzzles that only people that go to all of your vides throughout this series understand like what builds you made in each (but you can do it however you want, have fun with it,  it is much more fun to watch when you are having fun). you don't even have to tell us where the temple is (you just should probably tell us if you make it so we look out for it or maybe you could hide it in the villager diaries). There are many ways you can take this so have fun if you do, do it.  Also I know you are a business, but I, and probably many others, would appreciate it if you could make this one free for your viewers that do not have the money to pay for Patreon as this is your 1 million sub special and we free viewers would appreciate access to your amazing world too.  Thanks an have a wonderful day.
Fun fact did you know that the top part of the south rim of the Grand Canyon is actually a pine forest
This gives me maaad terraria vibes
So cool
You should add some mods like small ones for example animals mod it won't change the game just as a cool thing to add
i just ate 3 chimi chunguses
THIS LOOKS AMAZING, you should add some sort of underground base.
I think you should add a giant underground base where you can find the main pillager outpost.   And maybe some type of mystical swamp or tree that houses evil witches    But I don't know what the lore of this world is so idk  Also maybe the pillagers main outpost is in the tundra biome and that is why no one could find them and stop them because it was too cold there and that is why they have blue skin.
Man this would be an awesome server to play with friends
I personally think you should have a world without the lore because maybe some players just want to play the game without the giant towns and villages. Just normal villages and towns.
Bro u are so underrated I wish u could get 10M subs.
Oh I saw this on reddit!!! Love it!
Wow, this is awesome! I'll bet playing survival on the finished map will feel almost like a Zelda or open-world adventure story!
How can we download this map
Leave the Mushroom island mostly uninhabited except for one villager that lives in shanties and is just... weird.
Minecraft 1.19 renovations for old updates, if happen
gravity falls
You should use tango tek's  villagers for this map
You should do some secrets under ground
Woodlen Mansion?
You Are The Awesome and hard working YouTuber I have ever seen!
I think someone stole this I saw the same on Reddit or was that u?
whens part 2 comijg out?
😳😳
He have such a pure talent to changing every things looks like in the real life, btw all the building and structure are very detail, i love it
Wow so cool!👏 I can't wait for the next Biomes.
This video is like,How god created the world🙃
Mojang needs to start taking notes
I wish we can feed the world creator with these buildings, trees and landscaps.
When you watch this and cant even do 1 of the roofs without watching a step by step trutorial-
Is it just me or does it kinda look like settlers of Catan
Your builds are absolutely amazing for sure....and I love it Here's my idea; maybe you can try leaving some empty and broken places intentionally and randomly across the borders of the biomes so as to give some freedom of building to the survival players..... because it can make this world unique for everyone
lesh go!
Swamp???
This is great keep it up
118k likes in one day... You deserve more, man. Congratulations anyway!
What about mining in the caves for ores and stuff, or is that gonna be in the mines, idk
You should make a mega igloo
Add Davy Jones ship flying Dutchman in the ocean deapths or on the surface sailing away
This dude, is beyond human creativity
Can you add something like the world tree yggdrasil in the middle biome cause I think it would look nice
Now do it in survival
You should get a to make some mods or data packs for this world
I love this but I think u should think about how playable it is. So like breath of the wild there is small villages everywhere and mushrooms and food all over the place instead of empty plains.
Trixy: 80k likes and I'll add the link to download this map  Gets 118k under 24hrs  Viewers: yes
Who's going to want to break those trees?
Idea: Small puzzles in a handful of the areas? Also you’re amazingly talented with your builds, keep up with the good work
you are INSANE
This looks so fucking sick
Make the world spawn in the middle of the plains village so it’s like an RPG starter town
Grian has really been quite since this vid dropped       Its a joke clearly
Excuse me, *how?*
yooo!! This is crazy looking good . I can't wait to see the next biomes!!!!!!
How to download this
I mean,,, it would be kinda cool and funny if there had been a plague at some point in the world.....
My man made a bigger version of mu megabase
if i pay for Patreon am i able to download the map download?
Moore MOOORREEEE!!
did you post this in reddit
He put so much work in this YouTube video like damn.
Will there be any ores or caves in a world painter generated world????🤔🤔🤔
This is uge ! I bet people will do insane series on it.
Minecraft, PLEASE hire him to your team AND PLEASE make him the head builder of all biomes and places.
U just earned a subscriber
You gotta make an underground city!
There is no swamp
Yo your awesome man but me I'm not good at building faster I'm making a map takes me 3 months 4 hours.
oh how i wish i had the patience to do this.
Common Profession Ideas for the next villages:  Wild West: Mining Taiga: Logging Dark Oak Forest: Hunting Mushroom Biome: Cutting down Mushrooms Mountains: Religious Beliefs
gives me World of Warcraft vibes and im so down with it
"Let's try for 80k likes" So far past that by 36k my dude, and with good reason, this is epic
What shaders are you using?
This is gonna be so awesome! Excited to this where this goes! Im especially excited for the Wild West Town!!
You should now redo the nether for the map as well -edit also the end
I feel that the northern part can be Skyrim inspired, just as an idea.
ASMR to get you sleepy but its just Trixy explaining the build process
How do I get this map. I need this map now-
id love to see a castel.
Petition to make this the fortnite chapter 3 map
Voya Nui anyone?
A meteorite / abandonded modern city would be nice!
Damn the world was right when they said the only limitations are your own mind
My man be making an entire game over here
I can’t with the wandering traders-
Withches hut
It does looks amazing, but... a village this size will be decimated by zombie raids.
Hey , The new Mmorpg Server lookin good
Minecraft might as well be a god because it's infinite
13:31   If villages were like this I would NEVER burn them down, it looks sooooo beautiful and gives me comfort living near.
That girlfriend's representation was perfect😯
imagine mojang invite him to the team and with the cave and clifs with this.
4000x4000 is 16 million not 16 thousand
Add dababy
You should make a video making the breath of the wild map in Minecraft
It looks like a hunger games arena
I don’t know if you’re still taking story ideas but here goes nothing:  I was thinking something similar to the Degasi from Subnautica if you have ever played it. The tale of a people that came before you as you try to track them down. You progress through the world finding abandoned bases and tribes that are devoid of all life. The more you explore the more clues you get as you find yourself in the nether to find their base there. You learn more and more about them until you are ready to fight the dragon, you enter the end following the populations path before you to find the end of their story and maybe find life in this world where you were alone. You defeat the dragon and make your way to a structure in the end, this is where it is revealed that they had all died either due to mobs, the dragon, or natural mobs.  The challenges for this idea would be enforcing the linear progression of the story, but that could be seen as an opportunity to make the story more exploration based and the whole experience open world so rather than force the players to follow the clues, they seek them out willingly.  Once again this is heavily inspired from the Degasi from Subnautica and is a very loose story that has definite room for improvement, but I had the idea of the progression based story and thought it would not hurt to pitch it
Mojane hire him to work for minecraft
Dude imagine an SMP on this map, the plains biomes being the central hub but groups of people claim one biome and depending on what biome you get you get certain buffs and defects. Like you cant change your choice once youve made it and then you can build an SMP from there maybe raids on other nations (biomes), trade with other nations, goal being the first nation to full conqer the map wins. Obvi some lore and rp gots to go into it and "rules" but like i cant wait for this map to be finished
Lol can you give me some tips on building, I suck at it
My builds on this are gonna look so meager just compared to the custom trees he made...
Bro I can only build fantasy like overgrown things but I can't build houses 😭😭😭 This makes my builds look like I was 2🖐️
I think it would be cool to add a underground city and lead it to like a customized end and end city
throughout the world I think it would look more Breath of the wild theme if you added some    Broken pillars and other ruins
shrines
How do you get so much time to make this big structures
don't forget to add boxes around the generated structures so the game can recognize them as villages, outposts strongholds, etcetera
this is so cool omg
How would you download the world?
Time to do an RPG Minecraft world thingy?
This is what we all wanted to do when we first downloaded minecraft
add a huge farm or ranch in the savana or plains maybe
Can you tell me what your program you used to make the world?
I think you should make a custom ravine
7:55
ayy its over 80,000 likes im excited
A quick tutorial vídeo for the village builds will be amazing
just thinking the time you used amazed me!
Bro pls make more, you make my day ❤️
These were some amazing upgrades. I think the portal would look awesome with some broken steps as well, but it's all so amazing!
Hay, some of the stars needs to be crumbled
Instead of a mansion, make a pillager town

Is it just me or that island look kinda sus
hi i builder to but...in mcpe...I don't have a pc yet... edit: notch belike:If I was still alive I would have changed Minecraft for the better ...
i know a secret, put a random sign somewhere on the map which says "There are no easter eggs here"
what if there is a secret nether portal somewhere, but it looks like its leaking in the over world. you know like this? like a little crack in the wall.      https://c8.alamy.com/comp/RWJ22A/crack-in-surface-rift-in-earth-realistic-fracture-in-wall-vector-illustration-RWJ22A.jpg
The flashy chest quantitatively earn because minister alternatively weigh versus a big puppy. organic, cooperative silver
Stronghold And mabey you could have some dragon temple in the end, and a enderman village
one concern in the beginning of this episode i think you removed the caves will you be adding thos back or making custom one or something?
nice 👍
Bedrock player's :(
The stuff you make is god like good job
I can imagine this being an epic rpg style server map
This is truly an amazing project good job
Minecraft looking a little bit like Da Baby
Maybe insignificant but you earned a like and a subscriber
8:45 anybody else reminded of the windmills from Resident Evil, Village windmills or no?
trixy 2070:today we upgraded real world
No igloo? No ravine?
I think that it would be cool if the mooshroom biome In The middle there should be a mother spore and it connects to some big mushrooms.  Also are you going to do the nether and end?
something that would be awesome in this would be a transformation of the nether as well... just a thought
I have an idea how about adding a floating island which holds more secrets and more likely an endgame type. Also (i dont know if possible) u could also add to the nether and end for lore stuff like nether will be the evil type and end for mysterious type
I feel like this guy could single handedly build the entire Wynncraft map
Part 2 ?
You forgot to put stone buttons on the wagon’s wheels.
Did you do all of this by yourself Bruh you can make the original game look 8.7 x more beautiful or more
Just from this alone I immediately got some lore ideas for myself. The Tundra once holding a mighty Empire, and the mess being the result of Industry being introduced into the world. I can’t think of much more for anything but I find it interesting none the less. Keep it up man
Mojang: Cant see a new designer Trixy: Am i a joke to you?
beekeepers. mojang take note
Plane biome where is black smith
You should add the Ocean kingdom you made to this map, idk if that’s possible but you never know 🤷🏻‍♂️
Can't wait to see the whole thing finished holy moly
You should def team up with a mc coder to make all the structures have cool challenges and effects
Maybe you can add mine in the plains biome for the to get there stone and other resources
bruh. first vid i have never i mean NEVER fast forwarded EVER great vid cant wait to see it finished love it!
Wow
I can suggest maybe add a another Island with HUGE bridge that leads to that island witch has a MASSIVE tree and that tree has many animals and plants it’s just a suggestion and this would be a massive “little” addition and would be a huge undertaking
We need dababy car
Something I think you could do for the plains is to add an underground city that was forgotten but still inhabited with massive magic tree and for story the cleric could be from that city
I’m coming in her for some Minecraft but nope! I got a history lesson
Add a crashed hot air balloon right here 2:45
You should build a palisade around the village to protect it from zombies.
Add a place like korok forest but with mushrooms in the mushroom biome
Build a buried stronghold from the penguin cult in the tundra mountains.
Pls continue this
Who else want to make an SMP with this map
Curious, How long did it take you to do this?
Trixy can you make a it where We can download it on Pocket edition
I think in the dark oak forest you should put the pillager mansion and also have like one or two igloos in the tundra or snowy biome!
ay yow its 115k likes where link
Omg MOJANG should use your village designs there amazing
Trixyblox should do a 100 day hardcore video
Amongus...
This is amazing! WAITING FOR MAP DOWNLOAD! Btw, this DESERVES A SUB!
Man i cant wait to downlaod this
I know this took so long and I love it and everyone will love this if you are Minecraft builder
I would build just one of those plains trees and be satisfied for the rest of my life
god tier building skill but what about the blacksmith?
115K Gimme da map
mineshaft
I think it would be awesome if you added a light house and a stronghold and some other cool real life structures
Please make the Mines more interesting in the jungle biome 😬
World box in Minecraft
For desert do mesjid
What texture pack did you use for the world.
Great video and concept     No love to the swamp biome 🙁
I’m definitely downloading this world
imagine doing this without world edit and commands
What about the Nether
Bro can you make a beautiful world in Minecraft pocket edition
Make a secret cow place or a subnautica reference please 🙂
Add kingdoms that rule over certain parts and their villages
Wow!
Do you have a world download for Windows10 edition aka Minecraft Bedrock?
These are inspirational, I'll use some of these nice ideas on my minecraft series and mention you like mythical sausage!
Im so lazy to do like that
do animals spawn here? and also mobs
You should add water temples as old castle ruins that live many ages ago that sank underwater
So that's why I recognized the church for the plains biome... (I'm a botw fan and I'm pretty good at it lol)
Now this is content YouTube is meant for
Can you Do Cave in this map? :D
That Mason Boine is bussin
STORY TIME: many days ago the player has been drifting along ocean after a genocide of his home, They then wash up on a unique and seemingly magical island holding some of the world's rarest biomes and most common in one big piece of land and a smaller island. The player then stumbles across many villages with villagers, enemies such as the pillagers, zombies and their variants, skeletons and their snow variant and many more dangerous mobs will this lucky survivor live to become a powerful person on the island or will he die on this beautiful island. Watch *TrixyBlox* to find out

GIMME hehehe
If he's going with a fantasy world, it would be really good to see a Beastman, Elvis, dwarves, and maybe demons(?) themed villages.
Can I play this map to mcpe?🤔
a suggestion to the jungle biome or the taiga, either make a temple not far from the village that has an egyptian-like structure of ocelots for the jungle and wovles for the taiga. Just a simple yet very difficult idea for me to do hahahahha! hope to see it when the downloads available!
You could see him struggling to build smaller lol
A under neath snow village
ADD FAIRY GARDENS
K I'm new here but I love it I really want to see more of this, also idk could you think of maybe a snow castle, u know stone bricks and then ice, idk im bad at building, waiting for the next vids, peace
Drehmal V2 > this
This is Legendary
Can't wait
Oh that's so cool, would love to have this as a seed.  ...wait a minute  This looks surprisingly familiar somehow...  I saw a similar croissant shaped land somewhere...
keeko
Bro yo nice
Yes
when will pt 2 be aired. i cant wait!
I 💕 your builds!!! And I would love to suggest with the story to collect three different stones, ice, fire, and wind. The Queen's Icicle plunged in the frozen depths of a crystal cave. The Ember Gemstone belonging to the Desert Goddess. A wandering Witch's Gale Charm stolen to a ruin in the tropic. Hope to see the inspiration build an amazing story! 😺😍
My humble suggestion: make a unified storyline for the pillagers. Maybe some military communications detailing their ultimate goals? Have the headquarters be a mansion in the dark woods. You could include tiny outposts and supply points to make it seem like the pillagers are really an invading force, and maybe it’s the players job to stop them….. or steal their ambitions of conquest and subjugate the villagers yourself. You decide!
I already know someone gonna do a manhunt challenge on the finished product. That'd be sick dude!
How did you get the base of it ? Like the land ? Is it a mod or something?
am i the only one who thinks his eyes look like theyre glass eyes? i dont know whether to think theyre beautiful or uncanny. strange indeed.
good so far but i wish you added a swamp
Yoooo make the desert village like Islamic city with mosque and colorful bazaars 🙏
Gonna download the map and play RL craft on it
2:14 i thought that wild west was a replica of wild west but in roblox, cause its so similar (the textures, positioning, Lighting and stuff 💀)

Do a sunk or frozen UFO
Do a 100 days in this world and download mods
Is it possible for US to play in it?❤️🥺
This looks amazing and I think that you should build paths that go on through the entire map
Is this an SMP world that you're planning?
Ive never even played, but still sounds epic! Any Cathay themed areas?
Hard work pays off man. Thank u for the enormous and more aesthetic builds!
Are Mojang gonna update to this?
this is inspiring, I needed inspo on a world I was making and I always look up you. you always give the inspo I need to make builds.
A secret underwater village could be cool 😎
Skyrim Turned into a Sandbox Building game
Can you play this map on ps4
WHERES THE DOWNLOAD
Awesome
Should it be the mesa biome be filled with some native-American villages?
ima bouta pass out for how calming your video is
Can u make portals to other dimensions beside the nether and the end ? BTW I can't wait to use this world to start a new survival world !!!
this Is Fcckkkking awesome 😎😎😎😎😎 Big Salute to You Bro
are you going to use a questing mod for the storyline?
Brilliant! So brilliant 😁 Can you put some fantasy features in? Similar to the underground elves village.  Giant pillars, bridges, lights, beautiful trees.....
This is honestly so impressive I wish I had this talent
is there a world download 👀
Can't wait to play!!
Why and how TF you only have 1mil 😭
this guy is too talented
Ive never felt true inspiration until now. I expected why less detail but instead we received this fraction of what yet is to become a masterpiece
Just amazed by how he can make this, how would you even learn this?  And how long would have this taken him?
Add in The bleak falls Barrow dungeon from Skyrim.
I need this ohmahgawd
this could be a map for an rpg game
You should make a castle in the snow mountains
make monster in spruce

So cool
INSANEE
Is that the island of Voya Nui?
Please do something really really cool with the mushroom biome!! Mushroom islands are my FAVORITE biome in minecraft and they get so slept on by everybody. Please do something exciting with it!!
What, how what no what MAGIC! WIZARD!  also how did you do world painter so easily like, how did you do all of these?
This is amazing man, can't wait for part 2, seriously, you deserve more recognition.
Why you slacking MOJANG?
Man it would be so cool if the download is available on bedrock :(
secret underground woodeland mansion
For things like this probably it's a Good idea Streaming when you building the Project but still keep the Quest Secret
Exited for this world
BRO PLEASE MAKE A WORLD EDIT TUTORIAL SERIES
I want to play this so much!!!! Also I want to play with mods to do it better! :D plz upload the download link :) P.D: Nice video!
I love sound villager😄
I think it would be cooler if you putted the mushroom island a little more far away, like, you would've be exploring the seas and find a far away island of materials never seen before, it would be sooooo cool.
Maybe there could be a secret underground society
Do this with the nether as well
I would like to see a frozen waterfall in this world, it seems like a challenging thing to do but I have faith in you. Congrats on 1 mil!!🎉
Me: happy with my almost pro castle and tree  Trixy: with their God builds  me: ...TEACH MEEE
Dear TrixyBlox, Would you kindly include Stone Heads in the Jungle biome? For Storytelling purposes, it will serve as a warning to players.  Its appearance is up to you. I recommend Mossy and regular Stone bricks.
man this looks so good i dont even know if id want to play in it, i would just ruin it
I think you should build a pillager castle in the snowy mountains
I want this map to be a survival minecraft series holyyyy its so goood
in the snow build a mountain with a Romanian style castle on it
Make Japan
#27 on trending! Deserved it too
Are there going to be natural spewing ore, mobs, and caves?
so beautiful... already wish I could live here lol.
Is it just me or does one of your eyes have makeup on it?
You gave me brand new game vibes this is aswome
I know that tryed his best to upgrade minecraft but you can't upgrade perfection
I love to play this map. It is insane
Absolutely killing it dude this is amazing 🎉
Mojang should totally use all of this for normal spawn.
In the mines there should be a plot where a disgruntled miner felt he wasn't getting enough of the cut for a huge ore deposit he found himself (A nice little bit of intrigue for the player to look into the mines). If a player is curious enough they find in his diary that he rigged the entire mine to blow if they step wrong because if he can't have the money no one can.
ADD MERMAIDS 🧜‍♀️🧜‍♂️🧜
Now that's worth some subs
this dude makes it look so easy
its in the shape of the millennium falcon
will optifine be required for the full experience? also will you do anything with the nether?
Holyyyyyyyy.. This is soooooo AWESOME!! I'm definitely downloading this when I have the chance. Also an idea could be a floating islands of some sort maybe a little magical place where you can only fly to reach to it. It would seem cool, Ready to see what you do next for the other biomes!
This guy is Grian 2.0
If you put it to max speed that is 2x it is more better than normal speed.
Alt title “rl craft but with no mods”
My idea: make a  island in sky for the player make adventure better and in the island have a pre wither:)
I'm definitely committed! Wanna see everything else your gonna do! 😍
Add a massive but overgrown, partly or mostly buried, or a collapsing statue in the desert or jungle to show there was once a great empire here but it collapsed
why Mojang not add this in Minecraft?
Awesome 👊
Real quick, not nit-picking small stuff, but out of all this beautiful and immersive godliness...... why would you put a bell tower on top of a LIBRARY? I feel it would be a tad annoying to be reading and/or researching quietly, in your own little world as you do in libraries, when suddenly massive ringing sounds out from directly above you, causing you to jump and consequentially knock over the lantern you were using for light, and fwoosh! No more library XD.
My guy is literally the greatest
lol saw this on reddit :o
Can you name the mystery villager “Mysterious Cohen”
Bro just 80k likes bruh done.
please make the taiga biome like a huge red wood forrest, it would look epic!
a work of art
How about the Blacksmith house Trixy?
Ok, DEFINITELY turning on notifications for this series! As someone who LOVES upgrading vanilla structures, this is a dream come true!
FINALLY I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMEONE TOO DO THIS FOR YEARS. LETS GOOOO!!!!
Idea: upside down castle under floor  Like, with a mountain ir something up
Custom nether too? or a huge cave leading to an underground city, I also think that the mushroom island is a little close to the mainland and i think it should be something that you have to travel to, maybe have a gigantic mushroom in the middle to have this sense of awe while u are rowing your boat to it, also town names
This is Insane
u can make a frozen cave in the snow biome and have frozen saber tooth tigers and mammoths stuck in the cave icy walls (and maybe a random nut for the ice age reference xd)
Oh fuck i dont think my computer can handle this
Sometimes I really like the recommendations of my YouTube page
Amazing👏🏼👏🏼
okay someone should integrate mods like ice and fire into this and turn it into a fantasy world
You did not just say 16,000,000 holy macaroni
Do you possibly think that you could do the nether or maybe even the end? I know thats a lot, but it would be amazing!
Minecraft 1.32 be like
This is awesome! I really wanna play in this world
Can’t wait for pt 2
Make  a part 2
Forgot the important part of the village. The good ol bell.
Trixy Blocks, is the world available for download on Bedrock? I want to know so bad because my friends and I want to make a DnD campaign out of this.
dff
Eventually it would be really cool to incorporate Herobrine and the nether in the lore of the world. Maybe add an area where a destroyed portal is surrounded by an area that was being “taken over” by the nether? The nether was causing problems in the overworld, hence the destruction of the portal(S). Perhaps the myth is that Herobrine will return if you activate the portal, so perhaps traps are in place to keep the world safe from some idiot that decides to activate the portal and reanimate the devil (so to speak)?   Just a thought. 😅
I might have to screen cap the cathedral to make an actual Temple of Time in the castle my friends and I are working on
Your light setup creates two reflections on your eyes. It’s like your eyes are made of plastic. Grate videos!
What would be cool would be like mob dungeons with crazy good loot in them once you beat them, maybe one in one biome or have one in each. This is really cool idea and I can’t wait to see what this world becomes!
World download needed 😳
Plains need water so add some rivers leading from the ocean or some lakes?
When 1.17 comes out you should raise the mountains' height. When I saw the scale of the new mountains, the old mountains look so petty XD
This guy does not YET have the recognition he deserves Not even after the 1 million milestone
Brother please survival world🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵
Who the hell dislikes this video
https://youtu.be/3c3PPmlFKK8
NGL Trix is one handsome boi
This is definitely one of the most ambitious projects in Minecraft I've seen so far, your patience and determination is impressive! Can't wait to see the results!
Dude this reminds me of so many open world games, I’m so excited to explore this when you’re done!
man, imagine a roleplay adventure like shadow of israphel on this map.
Dude this f**king insane!!!! I will subscribe so i can be updated again.
Wow
I love your builds, can't wait to play in this!! I like to make mushroom houses in my worlds, but what about a mushroom town!! XD  I was a bit thrown off when the stairs to the ruined nether portal weren't destroyed, other than that everything is awesome!!!! Masive props
Wow, can't wait to play it
I know this map isn't finished but just the little bit that is i already wish i had a laptop so i could download this map
I can’t wait for the map! It looks so good
If you ever feel useless, remember that there are people disliking this.
Cheese
Imagine a floating island like how he did for Sokovia in Marvel
I’m excited for dark oak forest and mushroom island :))
I cannot wait to play this with my friends, it looks fantastic!
Im gonna be jealous if this is only available in pc
I’m so hyped for when I actually get to play on this map! I’m so excited for the story too!!! Can’t wait, keep up the good work!
How are we going to download it if we are on console like switch, and ps4
@ForgeLabs ...... u know what to do
I appreciate your dedication this must of took a lot of to time to build this and cant believe you actually did this and other builds
i stil cna beleive that he is this good at building
Yo trixy keep up the great work! Maybe if you are going to transform a Stronghold, you should put in in the snowy mountains area
This is just insane... it's just sad that I'm a day late since I either missed the notification or YouTube was annoying and didn't give me one
It's either supposed to be a person's brain/VR set or an actual island.  .    . 👍👍
I’m sorry but like , touch grass...        Then make me a mc world >:)
why so many ads jesus
Idea for one of the biomes:  An animal kingdom feachuring tons of animals from across the map like parrots, cows, chicken, sheep, ocelots, foxes and rabbits. But the most important thing a *secret* statue of a *you decide* (player, mob or legend/myth like herobrine or notch). The can also be a treasure under the statue like a special custom structure or a secret village fitted to no biome. Mabye even a stronghold or just a bunch of valuales like diamond emeralds gold and other things. It could even be something like a desert temple but better mabye like a super valuable treasure but a dangerous labyrinth to get to it.  Biome idea:  this is *optional* but what about something in the sky like a floating island i dont know what could be on *im leaving that for you tk decide*  Question:   Will there be ravines in the over world and will the have structures in them Will there be mineshafts in the overworld and hoe will the look Will the be any caves in the overworld and what features will theh have What about the end and nether cause this has to be playable in survival and beatable. In the nether will the be features like villages and secrets? In the nether will you customize or make nether fortresses, bastions and other custom structures like statues of the wither or another extremely powerful nether mob with valuables mostly gold under or near the statue? Will the nether be 2 million blocks wide (16000000 ÷ 8)  In the end what about the enterance to the end (the stronghold) the exit the end city gateway portal the end citys the obsidian spikes (pillars) and actual island
This man should be the one who makes all those tutorials on how to build things in Minecraft... The tutorials are no match for this mans buildings.
Buy AMC STOCK!
Villagers be like : WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING TO MY HOUSE T-T
a little idea, make an abandoned castle in the taiga
oh god i’m a year to early i can’t just go to the next episode 😩😩
I'm so excited for this :)
omgggggg this is so cool!!! You definetly got another subscribere here! You should add pyramids in the desert biome and some kind of panda/bamboo forest in the jungle biome! I honestly can’t believe you actually do this you’re so talented!! I can’t wait for the next video and to play the map!!
Castle.
Rebuild stronghold
Fun Fact: srpurse tree are in the tiga and the tunda has small amounts of trees and more snow and ice. 😁
how to download map?
Why is this man not working with mojang?!
My manz is a phenomenal builder!!!
Include some RPG modes! You're basically making skyrim!!! LOl
You should add pillaged cities
we want part 2 now
this is absolutely legendary, cant wait for part two! also, you just earned a new sub!
add 1 deaced gaurdian hidden somewhere in the plains to contribute to botw refrences
This is amazing. I’ve never seen one of your videos before. New subscriber. Thanks man.
Your builds are amazing. It looks like how I would imagine Minecraft when I was little and it’s great seeing it brought to life
this looks grate keep up the good work
Hey was wondering if you put in a ravine? Because if you didn't can you place it in the desert or mesa? It could be like a ravine village. P.S. Mesa could be milked for story because the Mesa usually has more emeralds
How about you do a biggass mountain, where on near the peak of it, slightly hidden within snow and a cave, there's a mansion that's maybe as big as a the first stage of the mansion, with Pillagers of course, lot's of cages as details how they create the ravanger, with some animals like cows and even villagers. Rest of detail's are up to you because I suck, but it would great if there were secret tunnels that lead waaaay out of the mountain into other biomes and even some structures and pillager outpost's. Showing that they are intelligent and have prepared themself for trouble. Sorry if i accidentally engrished a sentence wrong.
Where is the map download
U should play on it it would be awesome
What's up with the eye?
I always feel so inspired when I watch your videos! It's better than any nostalgia that Minecraft could ever give me on it's own!
Imagine he puts this on a MOD that would be mind blowing and most  unbelievable thing that would have done in MINECRAFT.👍
At 9:54 I would make the tree in the middle the biggest tree in it and a Library and Maybe three stories tall (the library). Also can't wait for the western one
Me: ah finally i finished my Very cool house!  :Sees vídeo  *I have crippiling depression*
Meh 7/10
please add woodland mansion. i wanna see how you upgrade it :D
You should make a massive bone structure around the dessert temple or ocean monument. I think it could really add some depth and make them pop out more.
I've always wanted a minecraft world with every biome and structure close to spawn
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17- For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
Make a hardcore super base on that
bro no hate but those teeth wtf
Add some mods to use
Do you use bsl shaders?
can u play this world and beat it
Great build! I never usually comment but this deserves to be blessed by the YouTube algorithm
I know is survival map but i must ask is ther like iron daimonds coal? U know like in normal survival wrold
Minecraft hunger games, extreme
This is the best video ever
I think he should earn and deserve more support! I mean look at the effort that he put into his creations :)
I feel like you should put some wandering traders in the cleric's traveling cart.
Trixy talked about BOTW... what if you made puzzle dungeons like shrines scattered across the map... and filled them with loot?
This is like Catan + Minecraft +Trixy level Insanity ahhaah
THIS IS AMAZING! You earned a sub!! Can't wait to see how you'll do the rest of the biomes!
Made map for player to hold one so we can have one like in  hurtwrold or other games
"16 times the detail." - Todd and his sweet little lies
am i the only 1 or this island is kinda sus...
You could make the mooshroom biom into a mystical floating island, floating above the water with old chains attached to it.  Idk if that fits the backstory you have in mind but I just thought it would be neat to have
I don't know why but when he said that there could be a secret in the mountains I immediately thought of some underground factory building iron golems
Omg i need this map xD
I would not want to mess with that pillager tower, it’s sooo cool; I wish it looked like that in game. Cool stuff can’t wait for pt2
Subscribed, liked, and amazed. Love this kind of content.
this is . . . the coolest thing
I love you. XD
Well it’s only been a day and looks like we’re playing it boys
HermitCraft??
we got 107k likes, gotta do a part 2, i feel bad for your sanity, but then again, its for the P U B L I C            (edit) and who are the 221 people who disliked it?, bunch of uncultured individuals, don't understand good content.
ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
You make building so inspiring and awesome.
THIS IS SO COOL!!!!! I am so excited for more!!!!
Upgrading *the plains biome***
This is amaziiing
OHHHHHHHH THIS IS SUPER COOLLL
Put the Canadian flag in the snow biome with some maple trees
You are Really good at building
Bit OTT on the chimneys
Bruh this feels like ARK without dinosaurs (I love both ARK and Minecraft, so this is a good thing :))
amogus
...... I wish this was also for moblie!!!!
This is SO COOL! You really showed how great Minecraft lets builders make it! Great job!!
waiting for part 2
My friend said what's the seed 😂
Dude this looks so awesome! I absolutely love the ideas you use for your creations
Where the blacksmith at tho
If anyone is a fan of Aphmau, does anyone else think of Starlight from Mystreet when they see the map?  Edit: Geez man, this is awesome, keep up the amazing work.
I seriously need to upgrade my pc
omg
Forge Labs he made it, now play it!
It's people like this that still keep Minecraft fun
Awesome video!!! Also I subbed :), so for the Mesa or Badlands biome i actually got the Idea of a Jaguar Temple being out there, cause there isnt really a temple based of an animal in Minecraft in any way shape or form, and Jaguars do live in Mesa biomes of North America :)
Just think about how good the minecraft updates would look if this guy was hired by Mojang
Omg 😻
cant wait to play this when its finished. wondering if it would be ok to stream a survival playthrough if i gave credit?
That's insane
Very impressive!
I can’t wait to see what will you build in next videos 😩
Wow!
this is literally an elder scrolls country. holy shit
Mojang should start taking notes
i love the detail in this village i wish i had pc minecraft so i could download this
Already over 100k likes, so i'm looking forward to the world to download ;)
Honestly my idea is dumb but what if there where secret tunnels in each biome that led the a secret smothering in the middle
Would you consider making a server that is a remake of the breath of the wild map? I feel like  that would be super cool
This must have taken soooooooo long good job m8.
This is going to be amazing
If I were to give a like but of advise I think that in the snowy mountains biome you should make a colossal ice fortresses for players to adventure in full of loot and some other great stuff you build along the way
"Clerics are actually religious leaders and would typically spawn in a church" - 100% legit and accurate, yep 😂 Awesome video, cannot wait for the next part! 😀
Imagine what he would do to the nether biomes
80k? how bout 105k
My pc could never
This is so awesome. I can't believe no one has done something like this yet. Can't wait to play on the map with a group of friends!
i don't mind if it's not but is this going to be downloadable? :O
Anyone else getting Westworld vibes?
Where are your eyelashes
Good job man!!
I can't wait to play this map! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
Poggers can’t wait until it’s downloadable
I am ligit excited to see the rest of the world builds. Your work is inspiring! Keep it up!
Bro you should add some mods to this
this would be an insane modded smp
You should do some super developed caves to keep theme work the upcoming cave update. Plus, would allow for more to explore down below!
you should add a custom stronghold that is a functional bunker
Make a alien spaceship crash in ur next vid
YOO WE DID IT! Where da link at? Pls don’t make it paid.
ğ
Fortnite map
Have you ever thought about creating something from avatar world?
Just a suggestion maybe add a underwater/ocean city or village. For the nether I think put a nether kingdom like a hellish looking kindom Same for the End a ender kingdom
The map looks way too big. It’s no fun having to travel large distances that are void of unique content.  Map size is only impressive when there is actually something to see or do in most of its area. Here it seems that you accidentally making the map too big hinders the experience as players will have to waste more time traveling from place to place rather than enjoying the effort you put into the actual content.
I just found your channel, I am do excited to see where this goes
Can you make a large, scary cave in the snowy mountains. Kinda like a windego's cave?  Edit: I believe you forgot the blacksmith's home
You should really try and get into making maps for ark survival evolved
Now this is a mega build. Holy shit. I'm actually making one too. It's just for me though. I might use some techniques used here as an inspiration. I will not use it for any videos or any monetization means.
the quarry should be further away from the library and church its would be laud
dowloaaaaaad plsssssssssssssssssss
You should build a house for the weapon Smith, the armorer, and the toolsmith
How tf did this guy make Minecraft look better than real life???
God loves you all
Why don't you make a personalised nether?
Como fazer o download do mapa?
YOOOOOOOOOOO!!!! This is so cool! Quick question though... Will this be for all versions or is it limited to only one?
World download pls
I saw this on Reddit, I can’t wait to see it come out!
You should add some tree stumps around the village and the outpost as a small detail 👍
Plot twist the pillager base is actually a wind mill
Me when This map gets finished and is downloadable: *prepares shaders and VR*
The fact I get excited about this just shows how much I love this game.
Wyd when out of sand?
Plz put this on pocket edition too
My mind blown once again on how you are so good at building. Also, quick question, will this download be patreon or free?
Please please please make a huge jungle village with a huge tree house for the main house and some houses built on the side of the trees and connected with bridges
Im jealous of how much talent this man has
What is the music called 13:32
Ah yes forceful evolution
One doesn't own emotion, and when one is owned by emotion, it's a reflection of one's belief that one owns them🎈
In the shipwreck, make pirate journals and weapons!
I cant wait to play this one day
Mojang do you see this hire this man
Oh shoot so 12:01 is a freaking church i tought it was just a normal tower 😆
Can't wait to see part 2!
Let's go more than 80k world is coming out other than that huge inspiration keep it up
Waiting for the Wild West city
Please transform the nether fortress 😁😁😁
A ice temple
This....... is ........ AMAZING.........
Definitely dowoading this when its done
How have you not been offered a job at Mojang?! Have you?
imagine playing hunger games with like 1000 people on this map....
omg someone should collab with this and make mods for it and call it the trixy survival challenge or something
You should add a similarly sized and themed portal on the Nether side as well.   Despite the fact that the larger frame gives enough harvestable obsidian to make a small normal portal, I feel like many people would rather utilize the larger size to fit into the build, at least eventually if not at first.   Would be really enchanting to work towards reconstructing the large portal, and be greeted with a similarly grand one on the other side.
Just an idea, but I think you should add a smaller island off the coast(about as big as one of the other biomes) and build a volcano on this island, with a weird rift thingy inside. And a strange radiation is coming from the rift, which is causing the area around it to convert into a nether landscape, with all blocks in the area replaced with their closest nether variant. I always liked the idea of putting certain dimensions in other dimensions, and that's what's happening on this small island near the big island.
You should literally be paid by Mojave for this
Will there be a swamp
Th
im gonna try to do a survival series on this world! This looks amazing
😢
I was actually working on a project similar to this, creating a map containing all the Minecraft biomes for a D&D campaign called Bioma. Had a bunch of stuff planned for it like a mushroom fae village, hidden dungeons containing Wither shrines, etc etc. That project fell through though, so I'm glad to see you doing it!
Great Stuff that must take ages seriously, you're a dedicated man and I respect that keep up the good work!
This is incredibly nice looking !
Will the world download be available on bedrock edition?
90% WHOA COOL MAP   10% Can We Have Map Link?  ( But Seriously I Need This Map:/ )
Do more like this as soon as possible
This is so inspiring thank you for the amazing builds keep posting awesome content also one thing I would love for you to include would be a Bigfoot cave and maybe a treasure room in the cave thanks again for the inspireation
how can this have dislikes
This looks so amazing, i already want to play it🔥😖💪
make L.A in the sand
Will this map be free?
You have almost 100k likes on this video, looks like you have a lot of work ahead.
Heyy, Is it useable for Modded minecraft, like Pixelmon, or others that have new ore spawns and/or custom biome spawns??
can we get a hidden cave under the mushroom island that is an abandoned safe house for the people of this land
I'm honestly blown away by how good this all looks!!!
Kingdoms in every biomes.
Dungeon with the end portal would truly make this survival playable. Also are there random ore spawns? Great content
this is amazing
this is giving me wynncraft vibes
This is insane!!! Cant wait to see what you do next. Keep up the good work.
maybe put some broken trader wagons in the snow biome.
12:01: what I can build 12:18: what this man can build
Hey u seen like an amazing builder. Could you help me upgrade my building skills from awful to almost as good as u? Well I would say I'm awful but not very good.
Looks like a lord of the rings map, in the start
I say a really cool ice castle in the snowy mountains ❄ 🏰 ❄
This is so insane I am subscribing just for how insane it is.
this is amazing
Amazing
For the taiga biome, you could make the pillager outpost a pillager kingdom, almost like a Viking kingdom. That might also help form a story line.
This looks great already can't wait to see what you make next
This is an incredible idea, I can't wait to play it
Can we get a world download of the map before you do too much so that we could transform the world in our own way? I’d really like to have the map as it was when you imported it from world painter because i like to build cities and different worlds as well and I really love what you’ve done with that map!
wow !!
The pillager outposts are like far cry. Sick
So there are ores and caves etc?
There actually is a traveling merchant variant of villager already! It’s the blue guy with the llamas. That could be the guy who owns the caravan instead of repurposing a cleric!
I can't wait to see the Woodland Mansion.
I wish this could be bedrock version of minecraft
I would love to see some sort of high tech underground base, similar in structure to portal, also some puzzle elements could go a long way into making some extra challenges
I would love to see some sort of high tech underground base, similar in structure to portal, also some puzzle elements could go a long way into making some extra challenges
Pleseeee put also in bedrockkkk
Add a sort of hellish version of the surface
Make like cave in Snow mountains as a secret so it hides some information
Looks like a game of catan
wow! this is absolutely amazing! I can't wait to see what you come up with next!
Is the world download on patreon or?
You should add a secret book about the pillager war
Do a gameplay video on that map
what happend to your right eyelashes?
Wow you are the best at building!
i did not even have to watch when I gave it a like
With the shaders on and the way you build this world, you truly make minecraft more beautiful.
Minecraft: write that down, write that down
The most hyped i can get at minecraft is when i get the full iron armor set lol
you have to add some of the "updated temple" structures you've made in the past. it would be a perfect opportunity to use them!
This dude made Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild 2 for Nintendo
Mini bosses?
i just saw this on reddit
imagine if it was 1.17 scale
It suck this won't be on console
Noice
Will there be an end world or will horses/trident be mandatory?
imagine playing this with mods :D
Can you giva us world download
those bottom row teeth looking good
This is the best minecraft video ever made!!! Well done bro
Will you make a bedrock version to download?
I want more! Please keep going! You definitely made me want to play again
I know it’s  It’s not  a  Minecfaft structure  but you should make a Santa’s cottage in the snowy biom who agreea
In the mountains you can make long bridges going back and forth between the mountains. And maybe he can also put temples on the side of the mountains that can be explored.  Note: Like this comment if you agree and would like him to see this comment.
I PRAY that this map will be free
You should truly make a Zelda reference like in the dark oak forest make a quest to get a enchanted diamond sword with mending and a bunch of other enchantments. Can’t wait to see how this turns out.
Hey there will be also a custom nether? If there is one I recommend making the Reign Of Piglins A big but sorta abandoned Reign full of piglins
Yeet
That roof on the windmill looks.. amazing wish i could figure that out
Everybody gangsta, till this madlad makes the nether
Pineapple
can u make this a downloadable world? If not its fine but it would be cool
You should team up with some people that can make minecraft mods to make special mobs, bosses, armour, weapons etc to make it even better.
Pleeeaaase tell me this map will be ported to bedrock edition!!!!
Yoo this is crazy can you put up a link to install it to Minecraft I will love to play in it
please do me a favor, pls build some mechanical island where can fit with redstone machine
I can't wait to see more are you gonna put a structure in the mushroom island
I love it! ❤
That’s really cool
Pirate ships?
Genius
This is awesome! This must have taken a while though
For ice biom igloo's and tents For jungle biom treehouses For MESA biom houses in cliffs For dessert Egyptian style
This maps like a whole new rpg game
Do you know if the map will be out by June 9th? I wanted to do a survival world with my friends with it. It looks really sick though, keep up the good work!
Idea for the taiga biome. Have a skull in one of the mountains and let it be an entrance to a cave with an ancient animal frozen in ice.  (Kind of like the frozen leviathon bones from breath of the wild).
Lmao 100k in 1 day this man's got a lot of work on his hands 😂
ahhh holy shitttt im so excited!!! this sounds awesome!!! im definitely gonna stream playing it once it comes out!! i'm most excited about the story! I love discovering secrets and immersing myself in stories. Hidden caves, treasures, and secret worlds all sound amazing!
this is amazing, imagine a full hardcore let’s play on this world
Add one of the Helsinki stone men statues somewhere in the snow area, maybe a broken one And perhaps a reference to Skyrim with nazeem and the cloud district or the college of winterhood
How did u get optifine working with fabric?
Sick
J.     Zeus.      That’s sick
water tower in wild west
I can’t wait to watch the rest of these
In the taiga forest, you could make a viking themed village that leads out to the sea ready to go out plunder other villages
Are you going to be making a transformed woodland mansion aswell? Maybe the nether and end along with it? I mean, doing that would be a long project, but then it would truly be the ultimate survival world.
The Mooshroom island should totally have an elven vibe to it, it fits so well with all the mushrooms lol
That also have paths and woodland mansion
Maybe add Relics from dinosaurs or giants who ruled the world before
You need to make wagons that travel from village to village to make the roofs plains village make since
Ice palace in the ice biome  Stone castle in the plains biome Sultan palace in the desert biome
why is the custom world looking a little sus
An abandoned city in the snow biome deep underground, fully enveloped in ice, maybe with a destroyed dam leading to the ocean.
I am ashamed to build a dirt house in this map
Plus looking forward to the map.
what you’re doing is really cool. Congratulations on the project.
a few small kingdoms in the tundra with spawners
Great job really great results cant wait for the final product 🔥🔥👍
can someone tell me when this is downloadable
PLZ can the map be free download. Becuas most Minecraft maps are so over priced.
In the snow biome make a yeti cove
i saw that on reddit this morning ig
Literally the BEST Minecraft project so far on YouTube!!!!!
Make a stronghold
Make a giant trident
You should add a stronghold
Make a sewer ;)
World Download? 👀
This is really cool
Nobody:  the squid in the time lapse:🧍🏻
Are you gonna make and put some modded animals/mobs?
Hi TrixieBlocks I think you should put a custom castle in each biome
Yay its 80 likes
Wow amazed
You should add in a villager kingdom.
I think you should add a cave/dungeon for the monster in the mountains
I dare you to count how many times he said _(custom) _
I need this map
This is gonna be so cool!!!
absolutely mad. Well deserved on Trending
A small Idea for a secret in the mountain area: make an scp 009 "red ice" cave. I think that would be really cool
Lesgooooo
A muslim mosque in the desert biome would be cool and maybe a buddhist temple in either the mountains (for the Himalayas) or in the jungle biome.
I’ve always wanted to do this I’m just too bad at building XD
he's like jeracraft...         but better
This is really awesome, can't wait for the next one. With some mods this world could be absolutely legendary!
He fooled us
this was posted on my bday
How is this mans so talented omfggggg
do you intend to change the nether, too, would be totally nice ?
Why do minecraft not hire you to build villages and that kind a stuff
Bigger pilager base in mesa?
Goddamn I wish I was this good at building 🥲
This is amazing...... PILLAGER TOWER IS  JUST SO AAAA   POV: your a villager that decides to leave the village and adventure the great unknown finding ancient secrets......
Looks like a bannana
But what about mob spawners?
Question: since this is the 1M special do we get the map for free this time because all your other maps are behind a paywall
Looks sick
Please Mojang hire him to design the new updates
map download?
Please build a viking village in the snow biome
BROOO WHAT TEH FUDGE
oh wow i saw this on reddit and didn't know it was you. really cool dude.
0:01 looks like amongus. MAKE IT STOP
I am so incredibly excited for this, I cant wait to see how you interpret each of the crimes and structures, keep going strong 💕💕💕
no blacksmith?
inclue one sign, at choords 0,0,0, that says "69lol" then I will definitley get the world
Something I think would be cool would be if you were to include an emerald mine in the mountains in preparation for the mountain half of the Caves and Cliff Update.
You have to upgrade a stronghold in this world probably should be in the plains but at the same time it could fit the idea you had with the mystery in the ice
An idea for the map is make a massive underground ice village that spans thousands of blocks
Tip: For Water Falls you can use  a Structure Void as the water cant move but you can go down it To Get it just do ' /give ( Your user name ) structure_void ' ( Idk if you know that but i hope that It Help )
If the pilligars have that much outpost there should be a fortress ore something for them🤔
Make an huge castle on an island connected by a bridge that has loot
That is amazing!!
Bedrock pleaseeeeee
You should get Grian to do a biome
You should make a whinery in the spruce forest because there are berries and it would be really cool to see
Wow
Can i have the download of map?
FANTASTIC!!!! came out amazing
For the second biome can you do the snow biome pls
WOW
Dang I'm glad to see this on the trending page
Add secret things to each biome and at the end all of the secrets when put to together should lead to a treasure chest!
YA HAVE 80K BRO, MAKE ANOTHER VID
Love this
Bro i almost spit my water over how clean that editing is
You should take inspiration from Minecraft Dungeons and Minecraft Earth, bring all of Minecraft together. If you ever do the Nether, take all the bastion variants and transform it into a single Piglin castle, and maybe add a few Piglin villages. Maybe add more dynamic caves and create areas to place the Lush, Dripstone, and Deep Dark biomes. Maybe add the stronghold in the Deep Dark underneath the Dark Forest and add another building above it to connect the stronghold to the surface, maybe add some sculk to make it seem overrun, and add the warden to the stronghold making it seem like a sort of guardian. Maybe make something specific for the wandering trader, perhaps something like you did with the Cleric and the Wagon.
Will there be custom caves?
where do i download it
Omg 😲 this is amazing
I was extremly hyped for this! Saw the reddit post and I am impressed!
Finally did it. GG my guy. Doing amazing. Im fairly surprised mincraft hasn't hired you yet.
I think you should add a small swamp, it could be great for lore
PLEASE DO THE BOB ROSS REFERENCE
Now make it a copy into a anarchy server
This is grains dad.
This is great, I would love to play the finished version of this map!
wowww
MAKE IT FREE PLZ!!!!;)
imagine having talent               couldn't be me
Gimme link now Pls
Awesome project, I really look forward to the other biomes! Are you going to transform the nether as well?
this mans is insane
9:28 "pretty environmentally friendly"  Nomads that travelled with their livestock thousands of years ago: Hey wait a minute..
What if there is a banded cattle
are you going to be upgrading the nether too?
What about the end? We will can beat the game on thus map?
In the jungle a world tree could be pretty cool but that might just be me
This is sick
I think it's a little over detailed
Love it
i would LOVE to see you transform the nether for this map later on (if thats even possible lol)
Mojang, add this to minecraft roght now or else...
you. are. amazing.
I'm really looking forward to it! I remember when minecraft adventure maps used to be the shit back in the day and i miss it so much!  Please take it easy and don't let yourself get burnt out in this massive project! <3
Wow that amazing
100k likes... That was quick wow
GOODNESS ME! You're unbelievably talented and your dedication and creativity are through the roof. Of course without even mentioning the incredible production on the vid. You just earned yourself a new faithful subscriber my dude.
More plz
Make a Giant footprint in the mountains  What maybe could lead to a cave or something
If I had a better computer, I'd start playing it, and never delete it!
Java or bedrock or both
Wooooo! This is a fabulous project! The builds are insane!!😱❤️
hidden under bunker house thing would be cool like the normal igloo but better
Trixy you have to add a volcano in the jungle
This is going to be incredible
Add igloos
Do you think you would be able to release it for both bedrock and Java? This is a really cool looking world and I would LOVE to play it. Great job!😃
Will there be ores and caves?
My guy going all out, I love this
U know he is og when he refuses to say badlands
I am excited to see more videos of this series...and i thought you can add a graveyard by the church
HOW IN THE MATRIX HELL!!!!!!!!
I saw this world in Reddit!
Put the mushroom biome further away, bc i think it is to close and it would look cool as a sort of remote, tropical, nature based island. Must say in HYPEDDDDD!!!!
You can build roads and paths from village to village.
Could you upload the Map finished and just with the terraforming ? Would be awesome to give us the opportunities to make our own world based on this map !
BOTW is my favorite game, so you know I’ll be playing the heck out of this. This is awesome, I can’t wait!
This was you on reddit. Wow
bro this with dinos would be great
wow.  I am hyped for the final result!
Please add a secret 2nd island with a temple of god the father
customise the nether aswell
Alternative title: making minecraft into minetopia
do AMOGUS REFERENCIA 😳😳
This man is crazy, and i like it that way
You could add a sky island with a castle
You should work for Minecraft! This is soooooo much better
This is sick!!!!!!!!
Damn that looks fucking awesome. I really look forward to see the rest of the build. Can't wait for the world download when it is all finished.
I'm going to play this map in VR👌
Make a mineshaft but better
When is part 2?
Ahem.... The sound your map makes is Wakka Wakka, I commented this just after you made the world
A cool easter egg would be a shell of a silt strider from Morrowind in the mushroom biome; also a mystic creature egg with different mineral blocks in it scattered across the island would be nice to have (to make a real Easter Egg hunt)
planning itself wont be possible for me
This is FUCKING awesome
My man Trixy, you're creating a one man Wynncraft. Good luck.
A volcano into the jungle will be cool
I think that some banners and light sources in posts at the villages would be very nice!
Yooooooo this is insane, try and put in a meteor in the desert or b0adlands maybe?
Oooooooo it'd be cool if instead of just a bridge or boat to the mooshroom biome there could be an underground/underwater system that leads to it also adding traps and puzzles to make more challenging💙

Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit NeedGod.com.
I just wanna say.. thank you
I think you should have a wall surrounding the village protecting from raids
*inhale* *outhale* BRUH
Desert biomes: egyptian style like the sphinx and other small statues, maybe a minecraft camel and some tents with nomads living in it, small towns  Snow biome: snow trees, forest with things that have to do with yetis (yeti footprints) a bunch of igloos, and like a huge ball of glass and inside it is some Christmas theme things like canes and ginger bread houses, a large river covered with small separated ice paths leading up to the ice castle  Badlands: dead trees, bunch of small towns with shops, salons, hotels and more and a huge horse stall barn, horse carriage vehicles on the roads, a large group gravestones with one huge dead tree with lantern, train tracks, bushes, a huge flatground gunfight area with some dead trees and skeleton heads  Mushroom biome: colorful or some glowing tall and small/mushroom houses/trees, massive massive mushroom tree with people living in cooking there food with some floors and some ground spiral path connected to the entire mushroom tree, water wells, another waterwell in the middle from a farm, the biome is a bit elevated like a grand canyon plain for inspo in a reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1cdrzu/mushroom_biome/) maybe some colorful normal trees and some colorful glass blocks on the ground below it is some lava
also the stronghold you have done
this is like..............Minecraft 2
Now hear me out in the Mesa back to the future 3 train scene delorean and the train
this is going to be the best map EVER made!!!!!!!!!!! No one can ever top this when you have transformed everything You should also defenitly put your other upgraded build; desert temple, jungle temple, etc. inside this map
For the end portal you can make it look like it's been abandoned and kept away from being known from everyone
Please build a Mansion in the dark tree forest :D
I-   I-   I have no words that is just amazing I am totally subscribing.
Will this be available on Bedrock?
Trixy do you think you could upload the plain island for peoplt to download? :P I would love to also be able to build on this island! :D
Can't wait for the finished product! that is just amazin
You need to add a the Forrest refrence
If you do make a world download, could you make one for both Java and bedrock?
This looks absolutely amazing and I can’t wait to see how it goes. I’m also very excited at the possibility of being able to play on it and would definitely like to get the world download once it is all finished
Nether next ? on the same world ? and after the end ? it would be insane
Yo when you gonna make another biome
When you finish this you should do a nether and or end version of this!
This really takes minecraft building to a whole new level. This guy needs more subscribers!
Why can't be the real strukturs so good !!!
80k pssssssss... u got 90k in a day
It looks like an amogus character, the island in the thumbnail
there was a mushroom on the cliff side on the mooshroom biome so maybe it could be hanging over the water (visible at 14:00 left from the tower)
hear is a idea a diary for the merchant day 50 or something he has been at the abandon village and escaped but bitten and in the other days he talks about other bioms and how the abandon village before it became abandon but vague and how the plains village started just a idea. Also he has a risk of turning into a zombie i wish you could make so there is a chance he would turn into a zombie every day but that would be a little difficult but eh im fine with it or without i.. Keep working cant wait to see how it looks at the end.
Is anyone else mad that we have to wait for more of these amazing builds
where do i get download of the map?
Whaer did u learn to use world edit
Is this going to be free?
YOOO THIS IS SO COOL!! I can’t wait to see more of this
In my opinion this is the most exiting project you have ever made
Is it just me or does the library with the plains biom look like a school
This is really cool. Honest got me back into gaming thanks for this
add so it suport ice and fire so you can fight dragons
Fuck cyberbug, we wamt minecraft with curv blocks and mini blocks
you should make this a mod with like heat and dehydration
Maybe make villager clans or counties and have like left overs from wars.
Can you build something in the nether too ? It would be cool to see something like on the other side of the ruined portal :D
Bedrock friendly map?
Schools finally over
You could even do a showcase of good builder's that update your map ! 👍🏼
Trixyblox: actually is just a little map  The map : 16 000 000 block :)
This reminds me of greed island from Hunter X Hunter
Please tell me this will be in Bedrock version too 😔
I really like these video's man. I can't wait to see and play on the finished map. Keep doing what ur doing it is amazing.
I think that you should make a gigantic tree at the center of the plains biome whose roots connect to the others, with the exception being the two desert biomes, making it look like they were purposely cut.
There are 3 types of Minecraft YouTubers: 1. Survival gods 2. Tutorial builders 3. TrixyBlox
Do it online and do like hunger games clock map so every hour or anytime it fits for this, biome is deadly but hardly survivable
aww man this is the kind of world I've been wanting for a pixelmon map XD (I wouldn't know how to convert this to work with that mod though) In any case this is looking amazing so far! I cant wait to see the Mesa.
I don't need sleep, I need seeds
An underground cave system with multiple outlets in each biome would be super cool!
Will the download be available on PS4 ? 🙏
listen i wasnt subscribed and now i am thats all i gotta say
I've been wanting to do something like this but I'm still figuring out how to even use World Painter. I love the idea of a huge sectioned off continent like this (kind of like the clock design from I think the second hunger games book, but less deadly...)
can we have the map?
Minecraft devs: write that down, write that down!!!
feels like rdr2
We did it 😁 we passed 80,000 👍 can’t wait 😝 for the next video
Can u make a survival series by playing this map
Mojang would like to hire you now.
Imagine if he transformed the Nether too! This feels like a series i would wanna watch to the end.
Maybe you should also try doing this for the nether and end.
Could you make some bedrock addons for structures your a really good builder and I’m sure it will get popular
Can you please do a survival series 🥺🥺🥺
Do something like this with the create mod
Yooo this was insane! I hope you finish it soon!!!
This is the reason i subscribed.
Trixy you should put a random cabin in the snowy mountains and a snow man in front with a baby snow man next to it :)
Is gonna be world limit?
If only minecraft naturally generated all of this.
would be amazing if you could incorporate the spawning mechanism into the pillager outpost/ocean monument so they spawned mobs also
It's only been a day and it's already at 92k likes. Better get building O_O
It will be cool if you made a giant abanded mine in the mesa😋😋😋
Anybody please send this video to mojang😩😂
That's some amazing work! Just one question. Will this be available for bedrock? You can transfer java worlds into bedrock with some programs.
Welp, over 80k in one day, you know what that means
pls make tutorials i wanna learn how to make these
damn i wish i could build this good
This is what I was waiting for!! Love the idea of mixing different structures into one world. Keep up the great work guys!
Yooo
I would LOVE a download for this world.
I just can't wait for the next vid. This is my first time seeing a video from this chanel and I already subcribed 🤩🥳😆
Snow castle
WHOA
I'm sold. This is definitely going to be quite the task. So good luck, and please try not to stress yourself out too much 😁
holy shit dude this guys good!
Is this downloadable?
this is crazy cant wait to see more!
Build a UFO high up in the sky
Can we get this as a free map for bedrock edition too
You as smart as a box o' blocks
Hey hey I saw this on Reddit D:
I saw this on Reddit and didn’t realize it was you
Dude, you just made a "Bethesda DLC"-type of island. You totally deserved a ton of appreciation. =)
GIVE THIS LEGEND A MEDAL AND A TROPHY NOW
give the zombie villagers a nametag and a helmet so they dont despawn
for the algorythm!!!!
I don't think i have ever seen anyone build a GLACIER before, so maybe that for the snowy mountain-biome? Or hot water springs with geisers?
I’m gonna start using spiked wood walls in my survival worlds they’re so cool looking
Okay but THIS IS EPIC
Can you use it in bedrock and can you use 1.16
Can someone please tell me how to make a server with a downloaded map? (Preferably free)
Dino fossils in the desert
This is awesome and reminds me of OOO from Adventure time
everything looks great as is, although i think the stairs to the nether portal should be somewhat broken
A monster lair would be awesome, like 1 legendary creature per biome 😍
You went on my recommendations. I clicked this video.. I don’t regret it. This build is awesome!!
What I'm expecting/what I want:  Desert: Big pyramid, Oasis, Some small bones, and traps everywhere. Mesa: Wild West town, Large Mine, Lots of bones, and dead trees Savana: Lion king mountain, and more paths. Taiga: Bob Ross. Snowy Mountains: Yeti cave, igloo village, and a snow mine. Dark Forest: Dead Village, Large Dark Trees, and caves. Jungle: Ewok like tree village, waterfalls, and a Science research lab. Mushroom: Fairy town and Witches in rival (like yin yang)
Upload the map
I've watched this three times already I'm so freaking excited to see what you do next definitely gonna download this!
Aside from the Caves and Cliffs update this would be what gets me back into Minecraft. The map looks so good!
SICK MAN SICK!
you should add a huge mountain chain
Thats really cool
Hello can you do a sky island like in a zelda game(i don't remember the name ) and do a village with a mega castle on it
add a raccoon statue easter egg in the ocean!
Can you add custom mobs to maps with command blocks? There's potential to release some sort of creature that hunts you, or a temple guarded by ghosts that won't track you very far but are super hard to kill
#realyGood
Can you please add a old pirates underground hideout with old barrels of stuff and his diary or something like that. You are an insane builder and I have learned so much from you builds.
You are a pro builder I can't believe everything
whats t4he seed?
yo minecraft BOTW
If jeracraft and grian joined in to this project, it will be so interesting.
Yessss i love western themed builds
Can we have the jungle forest ft a long house base of Borneo long house ? It would really call to see it .
No swamp?
It would be kinda cool to add like a small pirate town on like the edge of one of the water-facing sides of a boime
I think an isolated, abandoned military base in the middle of the desert would be quite cool
you should add a secret bunker in the mooshroom biome that can only be found with a treasure map
Mooooooooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Homie literally made lore for minecraft
It could just be the lighting but it looks like he’s got a black eye on the right side. I hope he’s doing okay
Add custom mobs like yetis and have a custom mod for the train so it works but you have to have a conductor. Also add custom sea monsters for the ocean. And add custom cowboys for the west that you can have shoutouts with. Love your vids and hope you see this
Which version is this map?
Oooo you should put in a witches hut and add a mysterious waterfall
It’s so relaxing watching people build in Minecraft
you have 90k likes put the link in the discription we want that map
This is absolutely amazing, really looking forward to the taiga
wow this is epic. I hope second episode will come out soon!
This is my favorite build so far!
This is epic
image him doing this with mods. and good one like ather of twilight forest.
this reminds me of the land of Ooh from Adventure Time
can you add like two versions? one is modded with like cool modded structures (can't think of any good mod mbmb) and one vanilla?  edit: oooo try the biomes of plenty for more foliage
idk know how you would feel but I think bison would be a nice touch
I always want to see this . . . And it's awesome
This biome Project should be your biggest Project yet and the most amazing when IT Will be complete
Please tell me im not the only one getting massive wynecraft vibes? love the video
Da Vinci who?
it would be great with a desert town like egypt or the gerudo village from breath of the wild with gigant pyramids :b
can u add a statue of Stalin for are soviet mother land
its a sign that I step up my building skills man Im too lazy
This alone deserves a sub!
What about the woodland mansion
Your dark circles are very deep, take more rest. I like your video. 🍫🍫
You can make custom maps with a painting app? Bruh    (Im a noob to Java, so this is pretty unique to me lol)
How would the cave generation and structures work?
Me:the map is so small for survival!  Also me:never leaves my base
This is awesome
will this world work same as a any other world ???
My man trixy is transforming a whole world while I can’t even make a dirt house
Who is Mojang even hiring if not this man?????
now you can post the second video
This remind me soooo much about The legend of Zelda Breath of the wild!
amazing! new sub
Can I buy this?
Mojang either needs to hire this man or take some inspiration from him
One idea I have is to maybe add a dock full of thieves and even a few ships and pirate ships
This looks so good, i have no idea what else to say.
The Whole Map at the beginning and everywhere else looked like hyperborea......wait--
This is just INSANE!! I have no words to describe how cool this is! Keep it going!!!
Brings back tutorial days lol
I love how the plains resemble zelda
100 Days in hardcore with this map??
Hehe, being very carefull talking about the religions😂
Add an iron golem in the swamp biome that sinks into the swamp and attacks mobs from underground
Dayum! Make an abandoned prison/gulag in the snow biome
9:26  Veggie Bois                                           Thank me later
make it so the villagers have a certain pathing and can do thing according to their job. example: farmers can plant and harvest crops
Okay the like count exploded in a day i guess you can say that time to plan when to get the new vid
How long does a build take on average
Research center in mushroom island
Build a secret underground laboratory under the abandoned village. It'll be a little like Resident Evil in that biome. And have a side story on the people trying to contain the virus turning everyone into zombies.
So much work for a village
Part 2?
Def subbing and liking. Can't wait to see you finish this god tier build!
Build a giant underground cave under the island.
You should build an underground huge library
88k likes in one day
1 day ago: already 88k likes  how
will there be a bedrock download
it would be cool if you made the river for the crops come from the mountains
Okay
super cool!
Trixyblox:just building a "quaint" windmill for the farmer    me:Bruh that aint quaint boi thats better than my bulids by 2000000000 millinon points i mean just look at it.
Do the structures load in loot like the normal ones? or just empty? For a real survival world you'd want the dungeons and things to spawn with loot to help the whole world
Wow this was my first trixy video and I am so fuking excited. You earned my sub man <3
Dude, with the effort you're putting in, you deserve WAYYYY more than 1Mil, honestly I am 100% sure you deserve over 10Mil even, but ill just sit and watch when that time comes :DD
Ok so trixy we know you took inspiration of the merchant from the duke in resident evil village
9:39 That patch of dirt on the right middle is not watered!!! IGN 0/10!! jk awesome build, you always create such giant builds and the dedication you put in these is astounding!
your insane at graphic design
The snotty net visually nest because asterisk decisively glow atop a toothsome east. probable, amazing cost
Tbh I’m not a big fan of the shader I recommend a new one BUT AMAZING VIDEO BRO KEEP UP THE WORK!
Would it be available for console or no
You should build a spider den for the roofed forest
Maybe a mysterious traveler, like Steve since he isn’t really a villager, maybe make some campsites that have been abandoned and some remains of human activity :3
Make a mineshaft underground were there are a lot of traps dangerous mobs but a journal from a miner a the end and 19 iron and 7 gold and 8 diamonds.
I would loveif you would put a forest, like the forest in Zelda breath of the wild
You should have a place where it shows all your first 1M subscribers or how ever much you  want I am not just doing it so I can be in your insane map bc I wasn’t even a subscriber before 1M also make a rick roll in ancient temple or something
I will make a show using this map
bro tus construcciones son geniales, sigue asi, siempre miro tus videos y me inspiras con tus construcciones eres un gran constructor y youtuber
CAN I DOWNLOAD THIS PLEASE!!!!!! LIKE SERIOUSLY I REALLY WANT TO DOWNLOAD THIS MAP AND IS THERE GONNA BE A PART 2 TO THIS CAUSE I NEED TO SEE WHAT YOUR GONNA BUILD FOR THE OTHER BIOMES!!!
You deserve the one million
You can make a secret room like down the well how it vás build
Trixyblox you forgot one biome a birch forest
Imagine making a server! 😂
Looks great man! Excited to see the next build
Majestic
This gives me diablo II vibes
Prison prison with redstone of course maybe mumbo jumbo
I assume that there will be a big ocean, since the map is an island. Wouldn't it be nice if there was something in the ocean too? Perhaps abandoned ships or sea monsters. Or maybe a high-tech building from the people long lost. Or even an alien ship? In the ocean you could hide almost infinite amounts of cool eastereggs.
I like this. I like the lore
bro i relly want to downlaod this map
Seed code?
Really good video. Congrats on trending. An idea i had was for the desert or mesa where you could build bandit camps or smth along those lines. Anyways keep it up.
Nether fortress,bastian next vid
NICE
Some underground eastereggs you will only find while stripmining would be nice 😁
Yes please
Maybe you could make some new structures ships and giant revines and I would love to see more tree types.
I want a mod that makes world generation that is like this
This is awesome
YOU'RE THE BEST MINECRAFT BUILDER I'VE EVER SEEN
I would watch him for 15 hours building and never get bored
To be honest your map can be used as an Minecraft film map or an rp
haha
instead of horses use lamas for the villager wagon
And it is probably on pratreon and this makes me sad
Is the rest of this world ocean except the island? Also maybe more trees in taiga and jungle 🤷
When will u do the next vid? (no hurry)
looks good
Since theres pillage out posts, there could be pillage villega? Or a mini caste or something like that.
Honestly this all looks so beautiful when i play if on survival i doubt i'll be touch anything just cuz of how good it looks
87k likes! 😆 Next episode soon!!!
Wow that was literally amazing and satisfying. Looking forward to the rest!
This map is going to be the next Skyblock, I can't wait. Good luck👍
Only 157 dislikes..... With over 80,00 likes..... That's a good ratio-
You should add a dragon like smaug
You shouhld found a built team
Wow, can’t wait for this to he finished. So impressed! I do miss some horse paddocks or stalls for the village, otherwise everything is perfect! Looking forward to the next one :D
smp server tho
cool i wanna try this myself now! :D downloading worldpainter imma try this!!
Will you be doing the nether and end?
I am your new subscriber , can u do a favour . Pls modifie villager's and there drain
Trixy is the most talented and dedicated builder I have seen! Keep up the good work!
Real respect to this guy who dous who knows what any hours he spent just for us
Make a new weapons 😍😍😍
I NEED to play this!!
if this would be built with the cave update it will be amazing to play, because when I imagined myself playing this in the future I wouldn't want to ever cave or mine and just spend all my time exploring, but imagine this with the cave update
Hey that’s pretty good
this had been uploaded in my birthday, and wow, wow, wow, wow you are very good at this I am very impressed!
Please do some more episodes of making this MEGA WORLD
Bro, this could turn into a real triple A (AAA) game with minecraft mechanics and a unique hero story behind. Like Zelda BOTW but different. Such epicness in this map, I was feeling that open world rpg game feel and got so inspired. Amazing work.
Reminds me of Oblivion
Uhh, where my habitat, the swamp?
The people who disliked this video were so dazed by the enormity of this build they couldn't see straight
This is a awesome project ... imma give u a sub to keep updated :) Edit: And btw can you make the Island in a normal world ? I mean if you travel out of the island like 5000 blocks in each direction .... that there is normal world generation so you have even more things to do ? And not limit the player to just the island and not disturb the beauty with auto farm and so on ...
you missed the chance to sneak when going in the pillager base.
Shouldn't there also be a stronghold, to make it a functional world?
I do hope you have a nordic theme in the snow (perhaps make Yggdrasil?)
Wait since you're upgrading everything does the include the nether biomes and the end too
You should add a mystic castle/fortress with a dwarf theme kinda like the dwarf mining castle in the hobbit
Cant wait for the next one
Is there going to be a End Portal?
Just giving the pillagers special needs
Aka Minecraft 2
Hey you can add a Hinduism temple at snow biome
If it is possible, i dont know if it is. Can you make it downloadable for bedrock. Im sure alot of more people will download it then.
Will this world be available for download somewhere?  Edit: this comment was made before the end of the video, so ignore please.
If this is going to be a survival map. How is caving going to work with the already pre-built landscape above??? Or are we going to have to hunt for materials like iron or diamond in the world in specific locations? or are you going to create custom caves as well? Great work so far though! I really love it. Just skeptical at the moment.
I was upset as you didnt show the terraforming :(
this is   a s t o u n d i n g
80k under 24 hours... epiccccccccc
Maybe in one of the biomes, you can make a pillager base (Maybe a castle or fort in the mushroom or dark oak biomes) Thank you for the videos, man.
How about a secret, ender dragon worshipping cult in an abandoned mineshaft.
I would LOVE a full on Boss battle if its possible ! It'd be absolutely sick
You should add an underwater cliff cave!
Bro imma play ice and fire mod on this it will be legendary
Id love to see him go full at the mountains of madness in the snowy biome, just massive mountains full of ice tunnels
i wish this map will be free you know it is after all a 1 𝕄𝕀𝕃𝕃𝕀𝕆ℕ special
Me after watching this:- how do you builders do this type of stuff
How long did it take for you to make all of this.
Make a Graveyard behind the church and maybe you could make a place for an end portal? As always you did an amazing job!
I have the strong urge to tell you to add catacombs to the desert.
This is awesome, If I down load it I might add some things from the Create mod. For example to make the windmill spin.
The structures are amazing do you think you could show us how to make it in a non time lapse to make it easier to make in our survival worlds? Love the vids ur amazing
Mojang has been real quite since this came out
This is sick which biome are you doing next?
when this is available to actually play in i don’t wanna loot the village like i usually do bc it looks so cool :(((
This is a wild suggestion but could you sprinkle in clue that we weren't the first explorer of this island, like there was another before us?
Please do Mesa next😭
ever thought about becoming a builder for hypixel or wynncraft?
Hello, is there some way to make a chunk to continualy spawn Pillagers, like in a typical survival generated world? I am making a survival map and want to learn how to make a chunk spawn pillagers, or woodland mansion enemies.
Add a rickroll.
i would just say that the villager are not at all protected -_-'
Also can u make a SWAMP in it bc of the WITHC HUT
silo nukes and a super bunker and a super trees and a mother tree
How to download this? Its very very cool
can't wait for the next part
This is so incredible. I Love it
Congrats on 1 million subs
Now where’s the download. Pleade
Show us the intererior to us
I haven't played Minecraft in years, this might bring me back to it as I need a more challenging experience. The treasure hunt idea sold me.
Don't forget woodland mansion lol
that looks amazing
How cool would it be if there would be a mod for this map so that if you place a saplings the custom trees actually grow
y are u not a proffessional designer for mojang man? love ur edits of the world
Will this be available for 1.17 and having updates for the map when 1.17 comes?
'Just a minor change'.
This dude is a professional house flipper damnit fuck
YOOOOOO i want this world download
Pls, for the desert, add underground tombs with mazes/riddles in the pyramids.
This map will work on mobile version?
in this morning it had 60K likes now it has 85K LIKES!!! it is growing fast. :)))
this is gunna be epic
Oh my god your such a good builder
suggestion: a happy little tree
its a great map
I have to say this looks amazing and looks great and cant wait to play it
TrixyBlox’s buildings, dedication, and concepts are the exact reason why I’m subscribed to his channel. He’s awesome!!
I subbed with notis on and everything
Already at 80k likes. Lmao.
The 153 people who disliked this video are monkeys
When this is finsihed so would it be awesome is the map was downloadable to experience the map. Great Job.
85k likes in 22 hours. Love to see it
For showcasing the upgraded village i think that medieval music would fit better
I think it would look nice if you added a sea side village where villagers would trade,doc, and fish. I think it would look nice with massive fishing ships and merchant vessels scattered throughout the ocean
map download please
DUDE, You could something similar to the Mines of Moria (hope I spelled that right) in the Snowy biome.
Can I help you build the map
Hey, i saw this on reddit, cool!
mojang just needs to hire this guy already
I'm so excited for this project!!! Amazing idea!
Yoooo! This is..... LEGENDARY AND EPIC PUT TOGHETER! Meabe i thibk if you make the map 2 Times blogger that that i thibk it would be' legendary!
I need this map
Maybe create a waterlogged village? As in, a village underwater that has been ruined and destroyed by the water?
for the mountain biome village i suggest those agriculture stairs in the sides of the mountain
this video made me go back to minecraft after 5 YEARS
Can i get this on console in anyway?
If ur making it based off of botw make the euro village in the mountian
looks like amphibia
This is so sick!
a giant secret snail no reason
Mojang should hire you
I have been doing some off camera work.
Umm... Doesn't the wandering trader already do that cleric thing?
It looks like wano-kuni
Wow !
You should make a storyline in it so the game and world has depth in it.
I wish I could subscribe twice.
Holy shit....    I cant wait for this   And the fact we will be able too play it for free?!?!?  This should cost like 30$  We love you trixy.
Hey it got 80k likes where’s the download, I’m super excited!!!
80k LIKES ALREADY??!?!?!?!?!??!?!??!!????!
Mojang should hire this guy
You sir are insanely talented I am always blown away buy your builds. You should check out the LitRPG book series The Land by Dr. Aleron Kong. I recommend that because I was wondering if you would ever consider creating playable worlds in Minecraft based off of popular fiction and non-fiction books. If so I have always wanted to see a Minecraft version of The Land series. Thank you for what you do keep it up you are awesome.  -Gnomes Rule
Your creativity is UNPARALLELED. Loving the small size restraint, as it still shows your attention to detail. Excited to see part 2!
Mega rl craft update
You should make the stairs look run down where the ruined portal is
Minecraft BR map? Would be a great idea to get some other YouTubers to come play a BR on this map for money or you build something they want you to build. Sounds cool ngl
Can't wait for the other parts to come out.
YouTuber : i built this off camera   The building :
You should add swamp biome with a Witch's Hut
Y is there no cross on the church?
This is amazing I want to play now
So under rated
So excited to get my hands on this! Already have ideas for how I wanna play in this world.
It’s so beautiful already and I adore the building style!! I can’t wait to actually be able to play it
What's the name of the Programm to  create the world
Can the villages be raid?
I want to play that map
Can you try and make it available on Xbox? I would love to play this world
Oiiiiii it’s 80,000 likes already where is part 2!?!
making small builds are hard  trixyblox 2021
Dude ur welcome for the idea,  I believe I was the one who first put the idea in the comments, nice work! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩😋😎🔥🔥  Edit: Speedrunning the map????
Stronghold, You forgot the stronghold.
Can you make this world purchasable from the minecraft store on bedrock when it's finished?
You gotta add mods to it so you can prevent stealing in villages and whatever so it’s even more realistic
This guy get into fights a lot or just have blonde eyelashes on one eye?
that is, at least in my opinion, the most amazing 1M special on youtube. Such a great idea i love it!
I'm literally dying because I can't wait a minute until you post this map again.i have no patience.trixy your the best builder in minecraft and you make good builders in minecraft look bad
Is it gonna be a free download
Why dont you get a team of the best builders you know and allow them to add other structures to the world?
Where is the download?
Trixy: "If you want to get the world download once this project is complete, make sure you get this video to 80k likes"  It actually hitting that goal  in less than a day
If you have time you could also edit the end, stronghold, and the nether.
I can’t wait to play in this world!!!!
Mojang should hire world builders like you and make their default structures. It would feel like zelda
every video you do is incredible
80,000likes in less than a day
This is minecraft but it's 2050
bruh 80k in one day great job guys
one word. Wow!!!!!
Richtig Geil was du da machst 👍🏻 Mach die Welt auf jeden fall zu Ende Ich will auf der Map zocken 👍🏻
Congrats on 1mil, you deserve it idol😌
Mojang hire this man!🤯🤯
This is amazing but i wont be able to play the world because im on bedrock
Dream shoud play in this map
Will the pillager out post work??? Like will they spawn there???
i suggest something about the portal. If you can make a nether hub as well but its ruined and full of wither skeletons for the back story arc its like made out of basalt or the blackstone bricks like it was made a couple centuries ago. Next is to make a frozen water fall in the snow biome since the temperature don’t change and i think it will be pretty with the shaders your using. Next is there is an abandoned old lab like made out of sandstone that goes under ground and it contains the end portal. Last is mushroom island there are gonna be some witches hut or something since its like a magical place that only the exiled mages/witches go to. i hope you read this mess of a comment. ily please continue what you’re doing!
I want to download this world
but what about the end portal?
Less that a day and already 80k likes like sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh
is it possible to put a swamp in there some how, i would love to sea how u would upgrade a swamp, like swamp villages don't even exist in vanilla minecraft
This looks so cool i really want to use it can you please make a video how to get it on your own minecraft
Holy Jesus......
I love this map so far it's the best thing ever seen on Minecraft
You should add a stronghold so we can beat the game and you should add custom caves Like so he can see ( you should do an interior vid ????"?????????!?????????????? 👇                       Ps have a good day 😀
This is amazing! I haven’t watched the video all the way through yet but if you haven’t already can you work in the nether through the portal?
3 things can you make it so when we can download the world pocket edition players can play it, 2 in the ocean make the shipwreck being attacked by a kraken and 3 add a raveen village kinda like that massive project you did but not as big.
It looks so good!! *sad bedrock noises* I don't know if it works like this, but is there a chance you could release this on the bedrock marketplace pleaase?
I think the END dungeon would work well hidden in the mountains or dark  wood forest.
id love to see some sort of abandoned survival base, something from a less fortunate, earlier player
The level of détails & dédication for this project is just awesome. Really good job, can't wait for the rest of the map.
PLEASE! If its possible make a custom nether and end that would be the icing on the cake :)
Amazing job, everything looks truly amazing
In the snowy/taiga biome, you should make a medieval castle, it would look awesome! And also, your an amazing builder. I wish I could build as good as you.
An idea: u could make a flower biome in the plains biome
Can we get a world link
He got 82k likes in 21 hours
Imagine a floating island like how he did for Sokovia in Marvel
You should change the end and the nether
I feel like more than 1 ruined portal would be nice, also a transformed dungeon (not huge but maybe like a few spawner and loot rooms)
i want this now
9:24  Pescatarian squad
Trixyblox i need to ask u if u can upload this map to downoload because its epic and i wanna play on it ofc if its all done <3
What about caves in the plains biome?
could you make  ur logo for the portale in the nether that would be made for the ruined portal?
Ok  This is epic
Imagine this map for an RPG styled adventure map (with command blocks). Damn
I have an idea on the snowy biome having a skeleton kingdom since it was snowy there and they fit on the biome pretty well
You should do stuff with the ocean biome like the coral reefs or the warm water biome
this guy I can barley make my house symmetrical.
OMG that is a so cool project I just subscribed because of it.
I think that in the farm you should just plant wheat cuz It looks like a wheat field If you agree give a up vote so TrixyBlox can see
Its just great but i would really like to see a watermill
Imagine he made the gloomy forest from Ark survival evolved 😯
I want to have the patience this guy has
can we download this?
Have you already planned to make routes or roads across the map through every village in the biome or it can be roads through every biomes with some stops like little villages you know to re-supply when adventuring I think this will be a good suggestion hehe hope you can read it 🥰
wahooo I can't wait! i am in fact new here but I am already very excited to see more of this world and other projects to come!
Maybe adding a pillager ship fleet near the island in the ocean could make a nice story of the pilligers trying to take the entire place
cant wait to see the final product. wish i was this creative
TrixyBlox please keep updating this map like every milestone you hit, kinda like making map changes in a battle royale, that would be very cool also congrats on 1M 💥
well crap gg
This was amazing Im very excited for the rest of the biomes to be made. <3
can't wait to play this map
Alice in Wonderland Reference in either the Dark Forest/Woodland Mansion or the Mushroom Island!
I love botw
Did you made this by hand? cuz if you did, god dang thats a lot of work
I am so jealous of java players
I love that you took inspiration from Breath of the Wild! i was thinking the map looked similar at the start. this is so cool!!
You are insane.Pls do part 2
i cant find your eye lashes bro
So basically Westworld...:)
i want more i wish i had found this video like in 2 weeks cant wait for the next parts
I thought of a story about a group of travelers from a far away island drifting near the ice biome. They could be from a big ship that crashed in deep ice and were captured by tribes or monsters from deep in the mountains. It could tell a story of how they survive in many biomes of the island through scattered chest, camps or even caves.
With the villagers it would be cool if in the diary's they talk about a curse that bound their hands together or smtn like that.
This man made Minecraft better than mojang
3:28 was that a desert well I saw
Oooooooooooo my god
diaries from the villagers:  dear diary,  HRHRHRHRRMRMM
more, more, MORE!!!!!!!
just WOW
This was SO GOOD
80,000 likes before twenty-four hours was up. My man.

Guenuinly get so much inspiration from all these videos !! Always end up wanting to makeover my own builds x
Sheeeeeeeeeeeesh!!!

Hmmmmm i think this is the larges build u have made 🤔
This man is literally too op...I solute, you absolute legend!👊🏾
Can you build a mosque in the desert and reference egypt with building the pyramids of giza? Plz
Shreks Swamp
When you create a world like this from the start does it still have natural ore spawning and caves with lave and such? Also cant wait to see this when its done I would love to download this.
Bridge to Mushroom Island?
Im hearing a lot of word "backstory". Can we mby expect an smp with a story somewhere in the future😗???
Minecraft should add that village in the game
This is awesome please do more videos on this😃😃😃
Do something under ground like a cool cave system underneath everything
now i wanna see a mrbeast video with this map maybe dream vs technoblade but with an army 500 players each that would be cool (if the server could handle it)
The effort you put in your builds is amazing, keep up the amazing work! Btw, will the stronghold be in the download so can beat the dragon? And maybe transform some nether structures as well, maybe even a woodland mansion :)
revamped nether in addition would be a cool idea
Titanic
Kaas
CAN'T WAITTT!
Wow what an enormous and cool looking project ! This is amazing ! Are you planning on putting multiple smaller points of interest in every biome ? Nothing big really just some little things to give more life to the map, like abandonned campfires, isolated houses, some landmarks with its unique terrain shape etc... This project looks absolutely amazing and is definitely worth the sub !
Go in the quantics team it is a team of builders pro
Not to be rude or anything but the scattering of sand around the lake is a ridiculous distance from the lake, it goes inland about 100-150 blocks.
WOW!!! I'M FREAKING PART OF THE HISTORY NOW.
I wanna see you legit just recreate botw in mc that'd be insane
You got skills! good job!
Man just made a hole red dead map
That LAKEYINSPIRED music at the end, just fits so well.
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Link me the download
WHO DISLIKED THIS!!!
0:42 the vidoe has excatly 80k like at the time i am watching.
80k in less than 24 hours.. sheesh congrats man you worked hard for this
Please do more if this. This was totally sick.
An idea:An abandoned snowy village with broken houses filled up with snow, maybe even some chests hiding beneath the snow
Just make a giant igloo or something
Make a Blair Witch or German dark forest theme for the dark forest biome
I’m so unbelievably excited for the rest of this project; the Plains biome was amazing! Will the world download be available for both Java and Bedrock?
here is a tipp: go and contact @commandgeek you both can programm a advanced world generation datapack you are the builder and he is the coder
I'm getting major BotW vibes with this map, I think it'd be really cool to structure the pillager outposts in a similar manner to BotW's towers
the Map mistake have accidentally gave you the best content I could possibly think, I'll be looking forward for your next video
add a ancient dragongrave
Hey Trixy where are the caves ? That's the most important in survival world . Because that's the best way to get Ores .
i loved this video
can you do snow cave's
Pls a free download
U can add a reef PLEASE
YOW!!! WOW!!! I'M FREAKING DAMN PART OF THE HISTORY NOW!!!
can you literally in the depths of the caves just add a dababy car for no reason.
I would be cool in you added a coral biome because i think is one of the most beautiful
I have no words for your creativity 🤩 😮 just....... AMAZING DUDE 🤩
80 k likes yay
you should add some hikers that was hiking a big snow mountain but died in the cold
this dude should make a server on this map ngl
I can't wait for this it already looks utterly fantastic
imagine makinng kool epik sik mc animation with this map lmao
Im not good at building but i think distory some block in the stairs to ruined portal because it's 'Ruined'
Imagine if this guy made an fully story loaded RPG out of this map
You should make one of the snowy mountains hollow and with tons of lava, like a hidden volcano. Make some treacherous and hard terrain to get through for some secrets  Edit: a waterfall would be cool too! maybe even a stained glass rainbow if you do a waterfall
you should old stone walls around the plains like in ireland! :)
Naruto world
This guy should work on the Minecraft design team for structures and terrain
Mojang, PLEASE HIRE THIS ONE OF A KIND MANNNNNN
This is similar to my customized world wich took 5months to complete and it is made up of 577.600.769.420
nice
This was amazing! The huge nether portal made me wonder if you're making a upgraded nether aswell?
It's already at 80k trixy. Do it.
Jooooo im nummer 80.000 😎😎😎
Dummies, you dummy 😂
trixy it would be good if you added some life to the ocean, and also add wrekked ships, treasure maps , and mushroom biomes
LETS GO 80K LIKES!
Maybe a secret dragon head or something like that
That island be looking sus
Do something to the end and the nether biomes and btw can you pls dont add the finished thing in the thumbnail
Put a huge bomb in the center of the mushroom island (get it, mushroom cloud?)
Gonna be hard to collect wood u almost don't wanna break the custom trees💯💯
We are so close to 80,000! We can do it guys!  Edit: actually I had not refreshed page, it has just gotten to 80,000 :b
I think the map looks great so far but, I think the obsidian in the ruined portal looks a bit thin.
This is incredible and i bet you eveything that those dislikes were misclick    Keep doing what you are doing :-D:-D
I'm getting real Skyrim vibes
I think it would be cool to see some sort of giant ruined statue somewher in jungle perhaps
Seems like if I will download this map, my computer is gonna explode
Hey i have a suggestion what if you start next the desert one and then the badland and make a village on the desert but little bit of the same but change it some and make a pyramid that is just a little bit look like the sand temple upgrade and use the desert feeling like and like on the start on the badlands i have a little suggestion add a little bit of a old town and that's its i hope this help ;)
Holy *shit* this is so insane bro your so talented
I would love a dragons lair full of gold and treasure I’m so excited to play this
Almost at 80k likes let's get this to 80k people so we can play the map
This map is gonna be Awsm 🔥🔥🔥
Villager diaries be like: “Dear diary, hrrrrrrrrmmmm.”
The ancient larch kinetically long because syria methodically paint after a piquant baseball. precious, quixotic drake

The video is out 20h and it already has nearly 80k likes.
So close to 80k
You and mojang should work together to make a new world gen algorithm.
This is my first time watching him  And ohh boy... I didn't expect that Also after this vid I'm subscribe to you
For the snowy mountains i imagine this eery vibe, with frost and thick fog, if snow particles or something is possible. And when you mentioned the ruined portal i thought it'd be really cool with some eery catacombs or dungeons deep within the frosty mountains, maybe permafrost accross the walls and prehistorical creatures trapped in them. And the cave would eventually wind up at a ruined thrownroom or something, with icy and snowy walls and some cracked bricks and stone to show that it's been abandoned long ago. Almost as if a civilization once came down to the caves to worship a king of some sort, or maybe a giant dragon king that slowly died or was slain in an epic battle against hundreds of men, or just one brave hero. Maybe the dragon king once was the protector of the mountains and through humans worshipping it and doing sacrificial rituals to empower the dragon king enough to lay peace upon the land and protect its mountains against other monsters and deities. And once we explore the cave we would have to go down a long tunnel/cavern that leads down to the big cave, and we could find a massive and ginormous dragon skeleton, reminiscing of the past. Maybe it holds a secret? Perhaps it's heart can revive any that comes in contact with it in it's empowered stage? Is this how civilization once thrived near it's presence? Maybe it holds the portal to the underworld or the end. I'm not imagining the hugest of caves, cause your scale might be smaller, i don't know. I at least imagine the skeleton to be maybe half the size of the cave (depending how big the cave would be) and the cave being packed with permafrost and icy peaks and huge shards coming out of the ground and the walls, 'maybe impaling the dragons skeleton'. Or maybe have magmatic shards impale it, as if it was slain by a fire deity, or the ruler or the nether. Then the cave would probably have a huge exit for the dragon to fly out (maybe too high up and hidden in the mountain for the player to be able to enter through that area) But if you end up reading this (which you probably won't😂) I'd just like you to consider my ideas. And good luck on your project, I'm looking forward to more content😁   And one last tip for your whole  project..  make puzzles.. lots and lots of puzzles and secret rooms leading to deep and unexpected rooms, catacombs, treasure, and dark sacrificial stuff. Puzzles and secrets are what makes any open world game feel fun to traverse and explore. And i want your map to bring that very same feeling of mystery and deep lore.  Keep up the great work:)
you had me at wild west town
Trixy: "Beekeeper doesn't exist as a profession." Modded Villager Beekeeper: cries in honey.
dude i swear to god when i saw how GIANT it is and how your trying to make it my hand started to SHAKE SHAKE im done how are ppl so good at building holy
Add a cars reference in the wild west town
In the desert I think you should add a dark evil civilization with a color palet of the nether with Blackstone and other colors I think that would be really wonderful
Comrade , You deserve more views.
what about doing a server out of it
I live these vids keep up the good work
Will this map be available for xbox players???
I'm very sad that it won't be avalible on mobile I would have loved to play this
The amount of effort this guy puts in is just too fabulous good job bro keep up the great work👍
In the jungle you could make mayan styled temples, with more structures that belong to that era.
Minecraft on steroids
Add mushroom fairy houses and a small castle (if there's room) on the mushroom biome!!!
My
me: gets excited over pillager outpost      Trixy: that was simple and I did nothing
THIS IS AMAZING
Dark and light magic light vs dark
New sub again
This absolutely deserves a thumbs up
Amogus
ngl, this looks like a good minecraft role play map
I wanna play this map !
This is too pog
i hope this map would be available to bedrock
Did you say plains is the most common biome because for me it’s ocean
I need this in bedrock edition, PLEASE I need the wild west town please if there is any way to put this in bedrock, please consider it!
A giant fossil or series of fossils exposed across the landscape would be neat
A swamp woulda been cool coz those Villagers look the coolest
put a pewdiepie reference
I think a couple of guides to making these massive builds would be cool, e.g. How you placed in and replaced all those trees.
I love how the banners are just having a seizure during the time-lapse
Command blocks for fast travel! But have someway to unlock them with a quest of some sort
add a swamp in man
cant wait till this is released
Honestly would already love the map without any of the builds in it yet. could that be possible?
Why didnt youtube show me this when it was finished😫😫😫 want to keep on watching
TrixyBlox: 16,000  Me: Lol it is 16,000,000
U want  idea huh well DRAGONS legends,WOLF PACKS in mountain,A YETI?,PHAT SNAKE in the dark forest, ELFS?,WEREWOLVES oh and a cult a dragon cult
you are so awsome
WHY INST MOJANG WATCHING THIS????????????????????????
Wer almost there help us get 80 k likes let's go
The best content ever🔥
I am so excited to play on this map
Amazing keep up the good work!
As a Zelda fan I loved that the pillager outpost fire pit looks like a boko camp
Add Iron Golems
I just wanna see @cubehd play this
Build a wall around the vil
Recommendation: I sort of imagined the mushroom biome as something mystical, far off in the distance. Do you think it’d be a good idea to reposition the mainland farther up and the mushroom island at the bottom?
Pls 80k We all want the map
That Brown Box thing in the DarkOak Forest in the thumbnail, is that the Woodland Mansion?! If yes it's Quite Big...
Can't wait for the download link!!!! I subbed and hit the noti for it
How do you build so well? any advice?
I ammidietly got zelda botw vibes from this and had the urge to play it
When the map is built will it work with mods ie load modded ore etc
You are amazing
I really hope he builds a sick bridge to the mooshroom island
This guy having 1m sub makes me think his underrated
You Should Also Make A Woodland Mansion :)
Love it
U R A GOD at building
you should include a guardian temple, they are necessary for survive because they provide a lot of xp
Woah
Ideas for maps  1)What if there was quest  to find   ancient,sword,weapon,potion,power or secret  and there will be gaurd  we have to defeat  it 2) what if there were some zone where in certain  time the monster, diff type of people  come form other dimensions  3)what if there is town  was cursed or radioactive  town
this looks amazing
Is only at 76k likes why
Ur officially one of my favourite builders in minecraft!
This man DEDICATED
you should bild a giant castle with the end portol in it
If only I could bild this good
The most talents builder on YouTube
First of all, that is amazing! I’ll never understand how some people are just so talented! Also, would there be naturally spawning caves? It seems like because you made the terrain of World Painter, there wouldn’t be any caves or underground areas, or ore for that matter.
Fire video keep it up
Will he put casual ores in the stone? Something like enhanced caves
more likes pls
This is super coool  The massive church is such a symbol
Finally a new video♥️♥️♥️
How do I like 1000 times
You should add Gotham City
Trixyblox why dont u do a swamp biome beside the darkwood forestb because swamp has its own structure and mobs and since ypu already planned the size you just need to put it like in the edge or wherever you want in the dark oak forest and you could also trnsform the end and nether cause of the same reason as the swamp you could even add your own biome in the end but this is just a sujestion hope this makes it into the map luke this comment if you agree pls do this
Dude you are the greatest minecraft player ever not just builder the best player and every time you upload my jaw hits the ground more and more
My GOD! I thought I was a good builder, but I guess I should stick to architecture in housing...
Minecraft should take notes
The thought of playing this map has me so excited, this looks extremely fun to explore.
The church is a bit disproportionate but it’s still amazing
Please continue the project
I honestly feel like they should bring back tutorial worlds and this should be one
World download?
Where can I download this epic world on my Bedrock Edition?
add a stronghold
This guy need more attention. His work is amazing!!
Mojang should hire him
Looks like Mata Nui.
thats actually amazing
Hire this man
holy crap bro, cant wait till the world is available to download
Bro.i just cant tell who's better at building  Grian or TrixyBlocks I just cant tell
imagine this guy doing his minecraft education edition homework lol
I can’t wait for the rest of the biomes
This island kinda reminded me of Voya Nui from Bionicle.
For savana can u build a japanise style house?
Nice
MMORPG minecraft?
We all want to see a 100 days on this map let’s be honest
Good luck on the project it seems amazing
"Quaint Windmill"
We need mojang hire this guy
Hey @TrixyBlox I was wondering if some where you could include a hobbit themed town because that’s a very well liked build style
Make a huge map of this map inside that map with the map... I mean really do it..
only 5k
I would personally suggest adding some more rivers, just to break things up. Like maybe 1 or 2 big ones that go through multiple bioms
Excited for the download! Amazing and beautiful world btw!
I’ve been waiting for someone to do this because I’m obsessed with the idea so I’m really happy rn ahh
Ur a legend
add some pirate ships
when you are upgrading the mesa biome add like more midival and magical builds like in  normal minecraft  because the wild west  styse doesnt mach with  the buildings in  other biomes
This is gonna be your top viewed...
You literally deserve tons more hype. This project made me want to play Minecraft again. Kudos to you, a true artist!
i wish i can build as greart as you
Why did you call us dummy’s not the training ones    I saw the text lol (no hate)
YAAAAY TRIXY IVE BEEN WAITING SOOO LONG your videos make me so happy❤️❤️❤️
The moment I heard you say dark oak forest, I know there's gonna be a mansion. Perhaps the owner of said mansion could have some kind of story, like a vow of revenge on an old friend who betrayed him, and then after solving his diary entry riddles, you find his secret project in the form of some powerful potions, a couple gold apples, or something else to save for later on your quests.
Can you make this as a Mad that everyone can Play this
Croissant thumbnail
I’m just shocked wow ur talented man
Why hasn't mojang hired him yet 😂
do something with aliens!
Damn
What if you made this into a CTM map with the monument-nexus type build in the mushroom island
Here’s some easter eggs ideas Abandoned water sheep church Waterfall with a cave behind it, maybe with a dragon skeleton Random statue or memorial of yourself Bikini Bottom (in the ocean ofc) Bigger, better shipwrecks Titanic off the coast of the snow biome Hidden dwellings from early nomads Make the train go through the entire map Connect all the nether portals with ruined bridges (in the nether) Abandoned (Anti)Dragon religion/cult
can you make a world tree? like those giant trees which go till the block limit and make a few villagers who live there.
Minecraft 2
Astonishing project!
the mark rober of minecraft
Add a mosque in the desert biome
How can we get this map? This is amazing.
minecraft gasm
his goals are beyond my understanding
cmon 6k likes and we get the downlaod
You should make some giant skeletons in the desert or Mesa!
Gorgeous
you should use the CREATE MOD it will make your builds more alive.
finally a new video! i’ve been waiting for it!
Trixyblox need to join hermitcraft!
yaaaaaaaay
والله إنك مبدع 👏👏👏
You should add a meteor or UFO somewhere where it’s crashed into something or buried somewhere and have and alien ship or pod in it or a virus/infection that affects the map like the zombie village you mentioned
If this is for a survival world, I'm curious how will the players get ores, is it the same as the default cave generation or he changed it due to world painter?
I was so sad when I realised that you uploaded this video today :( I really can not wait to see where this goes and to watch every video on this fantastic idea you have, this cool world you have got planned. What you've done in the plains is just wow, amazing and I have no more words its just out of this world amazing dude. I'm so happy I found your channel, it is so fun and inspiring to watch your videos :) Thank you for such good content and again I can't wait to see more on this new survival world!
I cant wait to play this map with mods it will be so epic I hope
Mojang should hire you for building naturally spawing builds and world seeds/worlds
Make a shipwreck next to the island!  ( a big one)
Will u use villagers from vanilla or tweak them a bit? Like the ones in tektopia by tangotek, they have their own town's economy and they'll have different professions to tend everyday
You should add a lore about extinct dragons and pheonix and add a area specificly dedicated to a dead dragon
After 80.000 pls make it free for all to download and not only for your patreons 😞
This is my dream... I always wanted to do something like this. Really cool to see someone finally do it.
You and the YouTuber known as jeracraft are very similar you should do a collab.
Make a giant ice and snow cave
An idea is an Egyptian styled village for the desert
Can't wait for the next biome
How do i get world painter, does it cost money? Tell all
Maybe add an area where a battle took place add, or a few sunken ships off the coast
Can we have the world done load
You should put in a volcano
In fact maybe could you re create how to train your dragon town
Add some stuff like castles n things of that sort to help with lore and random caves with traps or buildings inside
Add a pirate ship with the pillagers  or a pirate island it would make sense why there are ship wrecks (I know mythical sausage is already doing it but it's cool)
give us a bit of backstory in the next video too
When you finish that, are you going to upload it to some pages for fans to play those maps?
New subscriber! :D
I think you should get more subscribers😁😘
Mojang ano na!!..
making the vanilla temples into zelda like dungeons would be so legendary and make this map very fun to explore in survival
Looks so amazin’!! But I do feel like the area around the church could maybe go with a small graveyard?
A witch village would be neat! Witch huts and wizard towers, that would be super cool!
He should add another biome: The Swamp!
Get this man 80000 likes
Bro you have skills than othere minecraft builders
you should try to add the upgraded stronghold somewhere in this island, obviously on a smaller scale but that would be kool
will you be making a resource pack that makes these structures normal and randomly generated. oooohohohoo so cool
This would be great with some mods! Especially because some stuff aren’t apart of the actual game.  Maybe a mod just for this.
I actully love this idea so much, your skills even just in this are incredible!!
I would appreciate an Inca temple in jungle
Bro I suck at building and thought I was getting better than I saw this.also good job
Me thinking your builds in the plains biome is too big: 😳
Can you build whiterun from Skyrim :D
I think you should make the walls a Little bit smaller Cause I think i looks off proportion
its beutifull!!! i think the plains needs a little bit more trees...
Do a place where all of the biomes can connect where they can exchange goods exclusive to that biome.
Hey Trixy! Great work! For one of the secrets of the map, can you do like a hidden treasure? It would be very nice for the player if we had to do certain little puzzles to find it out!
dope
Make a large tree as an attack on Titan reference 😂
Cant wait to see forge labs play this map with mods.
Trixy you should find a modder and get him make a custom mod made for this map, it could be like a questing mod, RPG mod, mobs and weapons mod, just to give a bit more fun to the map when playing it
It's 18 hours old and we almost have the 80k  Nice
i love this! maybe you should have carriages scattered around for wandering traders
Please make it more realistic this time with like not massive pillars that are unreal
When u get isekaid into another world
I litterly just found this vid randomly and I gotta say this is a masterpiece.  Even with WE this is still hard to create.
everyone please make the likes upto 80k i really wanna try the custom map
For a secret you should add Atlantis of the coast of the world
Your the kinda person we’re building a whole map is just easy
Give me the map-
make a secret giant cool cave
Weee need le mapp download eeee  Like the video now, eeee
This map would make a great smp
shee wama, this is amazing!
really excited for what comes next
this is so poggers
The dedication omygod!! Are we gonna forget that this is trixybox
I always wanted to do this my self but I can't get a custom world :(
If minecraft was a real rpg game:
Ask HermitCraft if they’ll use this map for Season 9 or later
This is insane
I wish this wouldn't be a patreon thing cus i really wanna play on this world
bro this is insane i think you should ad d a roman style arena in the world:) big fan waiting for the nextt part
he forgot beetroot on the farm
This guy can literally be a Minecraft builds developer.
I need this!
It would be pretty cool if transformed the nether too, maybe add a custom fortress or something.
👀 this is epic
0:45  *When u forget to put on mascara on ur Right eye lashes .*
A stationary guardian or like a sleeping golem would be cool
Vindicators: *About to kill Trixy* Evoker: *Why are you killing the Architect that's renovating the mansion?*
Can you add a Viking settlement in the snow biome next to the sea
This is how it feels to make a Homebrew D&D world
why does his face look  like a really good deepfake?
Give the download link of this world in the next video. I have also a question. Question: How much time it take  you to build? And which shaders you are using?
Maybe you could add small natural landmarks that are rare natural features. A rock arch in the mesa, small sections of hills in the plains and maybe small ruins of former settlements in the plains and other biomes too
this is a very cool Idea i hope you finish it (dont ggive up) ?
I think for the pillager base only have the one Guard tower as I think two is a bit overkill and is less temporary than two
Oh that's awesome!
This will be fun
But in a huge subscribe button on the desert
you are the best builder ever
You shouldnt give it to us for free. Put it on your patreon. You do too much work for you not to get some serious cash
Nice
Would this be just for Java or can Bedrock players be able to play it
I love how the villanger started Farming
wow
Wooowwww I want to give this video more than a like, it’s sooo much time and planning that I wouldn’t want to do to make all this and mannnn, I already want to download the world as it is loll
I love how he just talks about games that I know especially Zelda Botw  because I just finished it again for the third time.
Hey I think a blacksmith house will also be good
I dare you to make the terraria underworld
I would love to see you updating your Erebor build from years ago, btw. So that it includes all of Erebor from every Hobbit movie.
71k likes We can do this
OMG! really cool! I like the design of the church. Fore the ice biom it would be cool to see maybe a big castle ore dungeon with loot in dwarf stile.
Plane crash yes yes yes
trixy make a giant dragon lair
For snowy biome build a tree farm for fetcher villager and go with lumber Jack theme
I have an idea, why when you go work on the desert you place like a quary to a rare resource that only exist in that desert, and a bit of the story is they fighting over that resource
Hi Trixy, I love this project and it will include the entire community! i'd like to make a suggestion. I watched someone play Resident Evil 8 recently and I love the Romanian mountain village vibe, so minus the chaos and mess, i think it would be a pretty good village vibe for the snowy biome ^_^ keep up the amazing work and i look forward to your next video
so if i want wood and cut the tree then if i put the sapling will vanilla version or custom one grow huh
villagers: new house who dis?
i hope you add hobbit style villages..😁..love from the phil.🇵🇭
Imagine if the map gets used for a SMP
this is MasterPiece
The giant island I saw that on reddit. Was that you?
Yoooooooo this is cool
This has earned a subbie 😁
oh I see your post on reddit, google wth
What about a secret oasis in the highest mounted in the snow area like in the missing link movie Just a idea also keep up the legendary work!
In the snow area can we get an ice dragon that would be cool.
would you be considering to do a port of this map for bedrock?
Would be cool if the mansion in the roofed forest had a pattern where you need to do certain things to get to the "treasure" (besides fighting the evokers and vindicators) like lighting up a fireplace to open a door somewhere or a small aquarium where you have to swim fast towards a button or something to open up another door .. kinda like the mansion in Tomb Raider 3 if you are familiar with that of course. This is a nice concept hope you have fun making it! ^^
I had to stop you in the middle of the video to subscribe, incredible work.
Maybe tent/stall/carraige for the traveling trader amd it can be pulled by llamas?
Add a monument that looks like a egypt pyramid or the sphinx for popularmmos since their og players
ඞ amogus
he forgot about woodland mansion
Would love to see a hidden Pharaoh's tomb somewhere at the border between Mesa and Desert biome, like a big sub-surface tomb that opens up to the viewer with lighting that is actuated through a puzzle game (think Indiana Jones style)
Isekai Anime Vibes
Mojang should made you and promote you to a world/biome/structure creator
Black smith sad
u neeed to change the colour of some of the market stalls!!!
Trixy, you are making my dreams come true with your Leonardo DaVinci level builds, truly amazing🙌🏼
When the world needed him most he came back
Add some survival mods ;)
We need moreeee!!!!! ❤️
Will  you upgrade the woodland mansion
Mojang: "Okay, so WHY HAVEN'T WE HIRED THIS GUY?"
Wow…what an enormouse job you did, hop you rich billions follower ASAP.
Please another content for tommorow. I am so excited to see the next biome ❤️
Im shocked it isnt on 80k when it was uploaded 16 hours ago  So underrated  People will probably make 1000 days videos in this
Hey we neeeeed the world download !  Please ❤️ Dope work Trixy❤️
Bruh, where is the wild west town?!, Missing lot of stuff
This map/build would go very neatly with tango teks villager mod.
This is so freaking awesome and inspirational!!! I LOVE IT!!!
download pls
Spawn Yeti in the snowy biome
Love the idea
Monster ilend
I guess his girlfriend think trixy has no legs
if you make this a series than you're going places
MAN so inspiring
When u do make it downloadable can you make it possible to download on the bedrock edition
69k likes is better
Your fucking insane
Minecraft is not a game it's a game engine
Tatoine from star wars
Where is blacksmith and leather worker in this video?
i wish mojang hired you to make the villages they would look so much better
Can we download it ?
Make a Cave Where the new "Mob: THE WARDEN" could roam and rule and make it absolutely dark in there so it fits the scary theme. If you can also make the exterior of the cave guarded by a villager (I mean just build a structure that make it look such the entry is forbidden and is guarded by someone and is living there.) and make a tribe village near by
The moaning periodical shortly scare because airbus trivially ban save a ultra elbow. selfish, optimal whiskey
gib me le worl d
I cannot believe that you forgot the BLACKSMITH THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST TRADEMARKS OF A PLAINS VILLAGE Thank you.
Would be awesome to have a custom nether fortress if that isn’t too much of a hassle. Not needed because of how cool everything else is gonna be though.
An Easter egg from Unnas Annus channel which never had existed ? 🤔 Maybe? 🤔
I can tell this will be a famous world download. Amazing work so far, Trixy :)
That village is beautiful! I am crying at it sight! Here, have my subscription
Pls do so Can download
me: I think I'm a pretty good builder! *watches trixyblox with all of his upgrades and builds* me: Welp! There goes my opinion of me being a good builder!
This is crazy!!
Add Fundy,MrCrayfish,McMakistein and CommandGeek to make this map feel like a different game
Can u create some giant dungeons whit treasures and spawners traps
Make it downloadable
can you do minecraft sivial seris on that map sorry for my spelling
Will there be a stronghold?
Please upgrade the nether
Where swamp!?
Man did a whole battle royale map
I got an idea for the snow biome it's that there is a town which is steampunk themed
Could you make a crypt as if it is to be like a very lore based world the crypt could be like a starting point-vote reference
Another title: Creating a lord of the rings type world in 2021
I thought the church was a castle
i just love when you do this its kinda satisfying
And a secret underground city in like y 70 below, in the snowy mountain biome, that would be cool
its ausome
Trixy give link of this map after finishing
Trixy give link of this map after finishing
The funny thing is that I’m build something like that and I started 1 year ago and still not done :(
This is SO EPIC!
Epic
BRO I LOVE THIS MAN SOOOOOO MUCH ITS LIKE A 💙FANTASY GAME!!!💙 SOOOOOOOO AMAZING🔥🔥🔥
When you start right below you is an hidden chest of course nobody mines dirt so good secret close but actually not
This is like Art, this is just satisfying to watch, as you build things better than I can even think of...
The elastic hardware hemodynamically concern because lute ectrodactyly borrow within a illegal wallet. pushy, victorious grandson
Could u place your huge desert pyramid instead of the vanilla one, and maybe make a giant custom stronghold? Anyway, it's simply splendid!
I think you can fight grian can you?
idea: add a futuristic city and then put a boarder in every biome and then make a castle/palace with the theme of its biome and then make a tallest tower in the mountain making it the center piece of the world and then make a bridge that connect every biome to the mountain island and then put like a underground subway to connect every biome and then add a like a castle for the pillagers that way its more interesting
You should really work with modders and coders to make your world come to life! Possibly with unique behaviour for the various people like the tribes and western. And get them to occasionally attack and negotiate with the others. It would also help to add some horror elements like in 'The Forest' to make it even better. I absolutely love your work, keep it up!
Bruh he's so creative what
We need to get this guy to 10M subscribers.
now this is epic
This is what we need Right, gamers?
This is what the future of Minecraft biomes and generated structures looks like
im ur bigest fan and i love ur content so much
AMAZING
This would take like 2years when done in survival
Please get in contact with a developer who can make sure that this map is really playable in survival. Mob spawns, ore generation, water and lava flow, a nether and end world! I want to beat the game with my friends on this map! Please make that happen!
once you're done and turn this into a play-able map, you should call it 'TrixyCraft'
Pls don't forget to add stronghold
This is amazing
It would be cool with a cliff side temple somewhere on the edge of the island. AND if the jungle village could be hanging from the threes.
that is not a upgrade its a revamp
You should add a story where you have to conquer every structure and look in every nook and cranny in an order until you unlock a portal to the end in the center of the plains
You should make the nether and end customize. And make the game beatable for the players. Good Luck Trixy, cant wait for the next vids.
Suggestions: - Add piglin statues next to the portal, because so far staircase looks kinda empty. - Make mushroom biome island into huge cow skull (Onigashima reference from One Piece). - Add ravenger stables to the pillager base.
70.000 likes at the second day lets gooooooooo we get that
Can we download his maps
What texture pack do you use? Absolutely amazing work btw😍
Me: *made a new account times ago* Also me: *didn't subscribe to Trixy for about 3-4 months* :I
If your done with the bayoms can u make a movie of all the ep
Loving it Trixy! Strong winncraft vibes!!
MAKE SURE TO ADD BEES!!!
It would make sense to also transform the end, nether, and underground for this as well, either way, I am pumped to see this build!
this idea is so good, would be a shame if u dont continue it
Minecraft Devs shouy hire him.
Please, please please pleeeeeeaaaaaase make it available for bedrock
Me just like: Screw the lore what about the fact that going from savannah to jungle to dark word to taiag to to snowy mountains because thats a better more accurate chain of progression for the environments
Amazing !
Can't wait to download it❤️❤️
''Upgrade''        Trixy: did you mean *make Minecraft stuff way more complicated and unminecrafty?*       (i'm not hating just pointing something out)
custom caves! Those would be so fun to explore!
As a pretty old player I am exited what this map would bring usung minecraft!
Can u pleeeeaaase make a tutorial for world painter?
can you turn ocean temple into epic
COME ON GUYS LIKE THE VIDEO SO WE COULD HAVE SOME FUN!1!1!
Pleeeease secret custom bosses
Can You Please do this for bedrock too?
PLS PLS PLS CANU PUT THIS ON PS4
everyone like this video go go go!!!!!!!!!
What Shader pack does he use??
how can I play in it?
A woodland mansion should definitely be included! You could try to completely let go and build an absolutely massive mansion for fun
Hope pewdiepie will find this
congrats on 1.04 Million subs! :D
Please add a big penguin to the snow biome
Good build lol
It would be amazing if you sneak in a Japanese style village in the mountains with cherry blossom trees
this might be the only megabuild that im really hyped with and will play it in the future
Idea: There is a crazy scientist in snowy biome and his base is inside the mountains and my man is looking for way to improve the virus that he created ( which is zombie virus) by adding big foot DNA's and making the infected larger stronger and more mutated. His base have lots of mutated zombies, hella lotta big foot evidences, his evil plan to conquier the world with his zombie army, lots of kidnapped villagers (possibly baby ones) ,labrotory with bodies/test objects inside of glass containers , hella big mob spawner, and his treasure vault ( the loots from the abondoned or infected villages) with map to big foot (bigfoot is a mythical creature if you can tame he will become your buddy unlike horse or dog he will be indepentent, also appear when called) ( also the scientist is kinda like witch but way stronger and he is the boss mob longer you spent not fighting him he and his army gets stronger as he captures big foot in his all iron evil labrotory)
I’ve been waiting so long for something like this. Love it Trix!!
The fact that this is less than an hermitcraft episode
Congrats on 1m sub!!! 🎉🎉 Love your vids!!
It whod be beter if u put jungle in playr of taiga brcouse jungle is tropical biom
This reminds me a lot of Zelda, Outstanding job Trixy!
I can't wait to see the outcome of this world and experience it myself
U sound funny when you say walls
you should make the villagers sell equipment of different kinds and it gets better as you progress into the map, also you should use some mods for a few custom weapons and bosses
Hey I saw the thumbnail on Reddit the other day. Being used already I see
Minecraft survival with a plot story! Holy!! I'm soo excited to try this like an anime adventure or something I wish minecraft would hire you and build this kinds of things with different plot stories, missions etc.
i think u forgot about the stronghold !!!! lol
Wow you are an amazing builder
Blacksmith?
Cant wait for the map to come out
This is just minecraft earth . Add new mobs hire modders k
Why hasn't Mojang hired this man yet?
SMP in this world
Where I can use this mod. Say plz
it would be amazing to see a woodland mansion in the darkwood forest
What an epic video! I'd love to see custom villager trades and maybe even mob loot tables!
imagine if the minecraft championship want you to be a they minecraft battle royale map.....like fortnite
It I am the ceo of mojang. I will set up a team with you leading it to redesign all the buildings. It will bring so much more to the game!
uhm i only have integrated graphics which is intel hd 4400 do you think that will be able to handle the map? cause im good with 30 - 45 fps if its possible
Bedrock edition?plz i dont have java:(
I cannot wait to see this finished
I suggest that you make cave entrances in the plains biome, a ravine, some little ponds like in a normal Minecraft world
The windmill would be great using Create mod!
This literally took customisation to a whole new level
I can't wait to play this!  and also please add The "world tree"
These guy need to apply to mojang lmao
the moon from majora's mask
God i have so many ideas
a sunken Titanic in the sea
A world that shows that Humans end up destrying themselves using nukes and civilization rebuilding it self currently in the medival age and there are mystical creatures (mutated animals) and magic being rediscovered .
You can add a crash alien ship
I cant wait to download this!
add like nukes in the ground thats worn down and old
TRIXY you shuold tranform the nether after you done this project
Beatiful
Man i wanna build my own one now
I think it'd be cool if in the middle of the snowy plains biome there was a fully furnished cabin with a working chimney just in the middle of nowhere.
The ice biome village should have pet wolves
random ideas idk  savanna: pride rock or something (I just like lion king lol) mountain that no one's been able to reach the top yet and if we do idk place where zombies came from and spread to the zombie village dungeon maybe underwater secret thing or secret island maybe a mission from each biome that all connect and lead to something else uhhhh idk maybe a whole new structure for a biome that doesn't have one already an upgrade to an ocean ruin sounds cool or a village or half a village that sunk into the ocean maybe an upgrade to a ravine or mineshaft?  idk lol those are just random things I thought of and read from others, this looks amazing and can't wait to play
A custom resource pack that change the way the mobs look, both calm and hostile ould be nice.
Ancient city that looks like the building we have filled with broken cars , buses and apartments
I think Minecraft needed a TrixyBlox because the minecraft map as it is is outdated and im glad you put them to notice on this Trixy! The Minecraft world needs and update like the one from trixy right here! You have such dedication and youre so passionate. I tried just making my own castle but turned out to just make a minecraft version of a real life castle from Slovakia. No, im Norwegian haha just if u wondered. Just found the castle so beautiful. But i think its about dedication and not stressing and work hard and long hours on minecraft..and basically play around with ideas you have. I support you fully man and i cant wait to see what is next <3 :)
damn.....this looks amazing!
An ancient city filled with ender men and having churches worshipping the dragon
Ahh, finally, this is what I've wanted all the time
yo this should be in vanilla Minecraft  that soo sick!! nice map
A tomb of an ancient king or someone powerful filled with mobs
A battleground filled with broken stuff , houses and loot
im so gona play this in vr when its done
Demon worshippers
Bikini bottom
Hogwarts filled with potions , witches and other magic related mobs that can act like a dungeon
Imagine, someone downloading this map and then making a box house in the side of the plains village
Books filled with lore in houses. You can add like a dead guy in the ice with a book next to him
Will this also be available in Bedrock?
U should do this with the nether as well
Video game easter eggs around the map
I think it would make it better if the mushroom island is a little farther, where you can only see its outline. But, this is just what I think.
A treasure hunt that takes you from the sea throught the whole map that leads to the captains gold.
hoth star wars reference
Petition for this to be actually added as the standard naturally generated structures
This is beautiful
I literally just saw this on Reddit
Pls like this vid so we can get the island finished
Can you add a metal dragon statue? It's my Chinese Zodiac animal.
wish you a fortune from this video
I just realized a BIG flaw in this... Where's the end portal at?
What about adding more dungeons? Underneath? Or maybe something that will challenge players
Dinosaurs in the ice . Or bones in the desert
And also can we have like a free map because this Is very big
You are best minecraft builder in the world.  you are my favorite I love you.
what shader do you use?
Holy gosh this is sick you are cracked. I have always dreamed of a huge minecraft world like Botw, and here you are, the legendary Trixyblox building it all in front of our very eyes. Living legend.  gonna try and up my building skill from now on. truly are an inspirational figure.  Can’t wait to see what biome you do next! Congrats on the 1m!
This is awesome 😎👍 I need to download it so my family can play keep it on
Why not try and incorporate mods and make custom mobs? Like in the ice biome there is a dragon boss guarding eggs which you can raise up to adult dragons?
it look nice
Epic! can't wait
How long does it take to make these kinds of videos?
congratulations on the 1 million subscribers :D
What about a Sea Monster next to the ocean monument?
The smith house could also be part of this village
I wish bedrock has this :(
I might make something like this but down scale it a lot
This guys needs to own minecraft and make it like that
I would like to see dungeons in every biomes and with new boss to beat.
8:05
This is amazing OMG I just found this Channel and I want to Build like that WOW!
Ohh You're just amazing
I just realized the physics man. What is the use of fire places with no windows? If I ever lived in those houses it would be flooded with sweat in the couple of months.
Valcano bimomee
This is great!!! Will you be doing anything in the nether or not?
Idea:ads rivers and more lakes and name them because naming a place just gives you a good feeeling also add citys in the Plains and some towns as well because villages are boring also very good inspiration i really like the map
One thing you forgott in the village is the well! It could make some story parts or hide some treasure and just be a real cool decoration!
Ayyyyyy! BOTW forever!
This was basicly the most amasing project you have started working on!
Does...does he know that there’s an actual trading villager
This is amazing ❤️❤️❤️
Are you going to make the nether Custodio as well?
You should team up with SystemZee for the additional creatures/entities.
Way to absolutely destroy minecrafts humble village lol
Love this channel
wow i really like it like so much
Can you do a woodlen mansion building
Put ruins of old tribes
Inspired me so much its so cool
You earned my respect man this's a real neat build. idea:Make a Pillager headquater in the mountain biome
How do I get map downloade?
This why I sub to you
I went to subscribe not realizing I subscribe a year ago. I haven’t seen your videos in a while
Trixy, could you please make a custom stronghold and end portal room please, you could make this world fully survival based!
I think it would be cool if the nether portal stairs were kinda broken, and had a little more wear and tear. I am absolutely hyped for the rest of this world!!
I think you should upgrade the Nether then the End, cause you upgraded the Overworld..      This is just my opinion
Can you made a fantasy map thats like a game and please made so huge so it become almost a exploration map please
The first village has inspired me for a vannilla village castle. Thank you so so much trixy,and plus+, you earned a sub. I will post the video of the castle intro when I finish.
I think you should add a wandering traders house in a random spot with nothing else around it. Maybe in a forest.
You should add a swamp in between plains and jungle!
This looks so cool I wish I could build like that
i want to play it so bad i just want the world quickly   and a note to minecraft hire this man for your new updates
You should amke ores more rare, since it's not going to fit if someone with full netehrite or full diamond walks around in this world, make it more like the old versions in the game, where nobody was super rich, i think that will go with the theme.
Make an upgraded stronghold
U should make a medieval castle and dungeon
SICKKKKK
Great vid please do more
Coolest build I have ever seen
Bedrock or Java
Zelda is my favourite game.I completed it four times and finished both dlcs
Mojang should add this world and have it as a very rare world spawn like 1 in a billion or something
Snow leopard statue
Here’s an idea: a dwarven village near the mountains with large mines and mine shafts underneath
Mojang better be watching this
This is perfect for hunger games
Put all your past video builds into this new map.
The amount of effort he puts in his vids is just insane!
How did u do that🙀
This is so cool for 100 days series wow any youtubers out there try this map
Make A Fallout Vault
cool
mmm yes
I'm really upset that you have to spend at least $5 to download his builds, I don't have $5 to give, I understand he has to make money and stuff, but dang, I wanted to play this world when he finished.
I think crazy to him is different
Awestrucked !
Get we also a blank map download?
All I can say is WOW!!
what about the cave
Someone needs to make a server with this map
Wow . Can't wait for it to complete ☺️.
Make a mysterious ice cave.0
Are you going to add costom caves and biomes for them? Also think you should add your own costom structure for the mushroom island.
He, plsssss, plsss, since its your 1 million celeb, plsss s give out this map for free
this looks exactly like the village from sword art online alicization
In which country do you live
Will bedrock player be able to use this
I've seen several of your videos and love each one. This is the icing on the cake for me! You are VERY talented and I can’t wait to see the finished project! You've also inspired me to do several modest builds of my own.
ice dragon
Bro! The graphics!
😲 WoW 😲
Oh my god this can become the ultimate RPG adventure map if we combine this with the create mod
You should add a hidden magical village, kind of like Hogwarts or Hogsmeade.
this guy just created a whole compact continent that is rich in everything. bet potato pc users will lag alot cuz of HOW DETAILED EVERYTHING IS
Your voice sounds kind of like grian
Why dont you upgrade your builds in 1.17 update
I wanna use this map when the download is available but what about the ores, they won't naturally generate cuz you custom-designed the world. Isn't it supposed to be survival friendly? @TrixyBlox
When will second part come?
Hey I am from india  U can also made a storage area  You can do mail box for extras And farms for cow,sheep,chicken,pig,and horses If u want by the way very good build
Will it be available on bedrock

Godamn everything in this video is seriously cool
I cant do this much, evan if I tried! This is awesome! 100% staying subbed and I'm probably gonna start watching more!
This is amazing, keep it up
Will the world download be free once you release it. As a thank you for 1 mil?

Make the first word of every sentence in one of the diary's rick roll the player
I really want to download this world and play it. I hope we hit all the goals so he will make it possible!
The entrance to the end portal stronghold should be in a secluded spot in the snowy mountains or jungle
Hey, trixy. Mabey you can add some real story and your idea of some dairy for the villages. The story will have some dungeons for some books with text. If you have completed the story you can enter the end and the ender dragon is the final boss. And to everyone else, go like this so we can download it
Anyone who plays this world won’t wanna break anything
Hey Trixy! Think you could do a tutorial on that Temple of Time esc church? I'd love to build it in one of my Switch worlds! (That and it looks really freaking cool... XD) (But seriously... Could you?)
I'm hoping for a woodland mansion
You should do a speedrun with this world
You can add world download?
This is AmmMaaZZzinggg
You should make like a caveman outpost on the larger rocks in the plains, like Farcry Primals Udam style.
lol im over here checking every few hours hoping for the likes to reach 80k
How do you get the world
Ideas - large wheat field -1800 city to explore  -coastal town - a ranch in the snowy mountains -gossypol town in the snowy mountains  -run down church in the mountains -a ferry to go with the city
Add flower biome to plains??👀 pls
yo, dude, I didn't even realize you hit 1M Congrats
This looks like a warzone map 😂😂, nice job TB!!
Have an idea. What if Sailors ate the mushrooms from the island and infected the village in the forest.
add the cum keepers crypt
Remember that desert pyramid you did 6 months ago? Copy paste that at your desert...
More plz
Wandering trader instead of cleric or have them work together?
I agree Travelling Cleric is better than a wandering Trader
They need this man to make Minecraft generations
Minecraft generator:im the best, but he is better
I’ve been waiting for this video for a long time.
Make a little tunnel under a rock like that one scene from lord of the rings!
Please add a little Shire in the plains
Can you pls make a mosque in the desert
I need a video of trixyblox and jeracraft making this world together that would be so amazing 🤩
Can we download the map ?
Wait was that 8 bit from Brawl Stars At the end of the build?
OMG I SO WANT TO OKAY THIS MAO I CANT WAIT!!!! YOU ARE SO GREAT AT BUILDING!
Maybe make a dwarf cave with like a lot of forges shops and mines.
Will this be available in mcbe
Hey buddy, the minute i put on the video i subbed, if i load the map will it lag, cuz i have a potatoe pc
I am so hyped
Some one should make a custom bee keeper mod for this world
me, instantly wanna see youtubers who plays Minecraft, to use this map to make a solo/collab survival, either normal or hardcore mode :'3
Cosmic PVP: You dare challenge me?
pls whats the seed, it looks so cool
This is sooo cool Im so excited!
Try building old American trading ships. Or the titanic
Underground secret biome!
It would be awesome if you built a whole underground set of biomes as well. Maybe even copy in the elevish underground build you did a while back.
Omg I need to try something like this
is the worlddownloud  ook voo bedrock?
Without even bulding anything it still looks amazing
Its perfect
This is sooo inspiring!
I thought it was the land of ooo
The multiple illusions this inspired me to do- heck yes.  The amount of work put into this is astonishing 👏
You should also add diary entries for the evokers, they could have a really cool story arc
Man Imagine Mojang steal ur village to upgrade his village for an update
Can you do a map Adventure time ??
PLEASE MAKE EVERY HOUSE IN THE WILD WEST VILLAGE SALOONS
add a storyline?
Is it possible to get this map on bedrock? Probably not, but it doesn't hurt to ask
More
Epic you are a God !!!!
WE NEED A COLLAB BETWEEN YOU GUYS!!  TheMythicalSausage, TrixyBlox and Jeracraf!!  A video like that would be iconic!!!!!!
It really feels like watching an art piece being made
"include the Bob Ross reference " Now that's something I wanna see
Love the ideas, the editing, the Ocean-friendly actions, you're honestly gifted bro. Wish you all the best, deserve way more♥️
trixy: makes secrets spectator mode: 💥<💥
The effort and actual architectural concept this man puts in his videos is unreal. I'll NEVER stop saying how underrated his work is
Love it
where can i download this?
Looking forward to this
I wait for the day TrixyBloxs and JeraCraft collaborate
Hey here's a little idea maybe try making a very detailed cave in the mountains and that's where the mysterious thing lives
The only bad thing about having a great survival world is that your builds cant reach the standards😂
If you are transforming EVERYTHING, you would have to include Nether and End Worlds in some sort of transformations too
you should have tomes full of riches but are defended in your pyramid wen you bild the desert
I think you should make caves a biome with extra features like your underground kingdom...
There has to be a cursed tomb in the desert right? Like some Indians Jones stuff!
Incredible work
Petition to add 🌊 waterfall 🌊 in the jungle
Will this be available for MCPE?
This was commentated like the most entertaining baking show of all time
Make a erebor like mine
Where can I get world download It works on pe right?
i think it would be sick to have a star wars crashed fighter or an AT AT in the snow erea as an easter egg kind of thing
Have u ever seen a man transforming everything in Minecraft? Trixy Blox is just awesome!
YES YOURE BACK!!!
an guardian statue for each biome like a automata
This guy isn't popular. He deserves a million subscribers.
I really want the map once its finished, but unfortunately im in bedrock edition
Mojang and its developpers are gonna copy some of these ideas.
Can you please make your free to download
What happened to your right eyelash?
Dude Trixy is in heaven because he said'while you are DOWN there
As a bedrock player, im quite jealous of Java players with this map coming out
Why swamp
Gravity Falls shack in the forest pls pls
This is cool! Great job!
Amazing build
Instead of the avatar it's just builders as benders the one thing is who wins him or grian
This is insane.. Will it be available on bedrock?? .. Please say yes.. Wanna play this badly... Can't wait to see next transformation..
WERE ARE THE BEETS!!!!, also check if you can light that portal
1 video 1 biome So we gonna get about 1 video per week?
Don't forget to include an end fortress. Maybe under the zombie village to add story
Thanks for inspirationnnnn
this is terraria 3d
this vid gonna get viral :D
Is this gonna be available for bedrock?
You should make an ice spikes village. Don’t know if you wanted to do normal snow village but it works out amazing. I found an ice spikes biome and converted the interior into villager homes it looked absolutely phenomenal
This guy can basiclly remake the entire botw map lol
Similar to other open world game, I suggest (if you can)  add a percentage so you know how much of the game you have experienced
What about the Nether?
I’m curious about what a strong hold would look like
AHHH IM SO EXCITED
Damn
Yo should add a waterfall somewhere
oh my gosh this sounds so cool :00000 I cannot WAIT to play this
He doesn’t want to be crazy in the plains biome, this makes me nervous for the others 😅
Add some secrets like Full Netherite Armor And Tools For A Secret treasure
For the wild west build can you make a back to the future reference
Now, this is quality content 😍
We need a pillager fortress in the taiga!!!
try making some holes for mines, mineshafts, the other 1.17 biomes, stronghold, etc.
Yeah.... I'll stick to building on Roblox.
This map would be good for 100 players
Amazing work the mojang team should really hire u if they did this to real Minecraft it would be huge and more people would buy it and stuff 😮
Suggestion: It will be awesome if you did the diary entries, especially in the zombie village in such a way to uncover some secrets!
The People who disliked are the people who SUCK at building and are jealous of trixyblox Lol
...    The Island is sus
Tell me how do you have such a smooth and calm voice
Man if you see this. Even if it doesn’t get to 80k, please continue!❤️Itll be insane!!!!!
You should add more rivers through the biomes.
Do ores spawn like normal?
Mans do be building RLcraft
LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS INSANE PROJECT!
Would it be possible to get this map on Bedrock? Just curious
thats awsome cant wait to play it
Good vidéo but to many ads
I ACTUALLY WANNA PLAY THIS MAP I NEED THIS MAP ASAP!!!
Add ancient ruins around the map from the ancient builders
minecraft. NEEDS. to hire him.
Hey please make it available for pocket edition
Can you give me this map download link
you should terraform the nether and end to make it a lot more immersive
SUUPPEERRRRRR
I subscribe for this..
This is epic! You have god level dedication bro!! Really looking forward to download it!
when will it be downloadable?
Hi trixy I am a fan of ur videos and in the videos I've seen I was just wondering what the app u use to make ur Minecraft worlds called
This is insanly good. Good job Trixy
My jaw dropped....oh wait it fell off...
these vanilla upgrades are the best
Congrats on 1 mil.
Pls add abandoned mineshafts make them SMALL cuz ur builds are hooge and then some cave hole patches with many ores inside like a geode. Make them rare. Like put only five cave hole patches and ten abandoned mineshafts. Or u can add as many as u want. Is tis gud? \(°=°)/
Who about underwater city Or Zombie forest with so so many zombie  With treasure in Centre
I swear to god you're putting so much effort to your videos and you don't get the respect you deserves
What kind of beast pc do we need to run this?
How long did it take for you to produce THIS video ?
This is amazing!! I can’t wait for the map to be sent out for download so that I can have this as a survival server map (I’d give a ton of credit to you in the bio of the server and at the world spawn 100 blocks away from the village)
Playing on this world would make for a kool utube vid!
This looks so good.... I am eager to play survival in this
It would be cool if you did a secret base in the snowy mountains
One thing that I think would be really cool is random hidden (like through red stone contraptions) bases, just small ones, one or two in each biome, all a part of some secret organization or society
imagine, just imagine if he built the ice kings home from adventure time... probably won’t happen but if it does extreme pog
It's AMAZING! I can't wait to play it!
GET THIS VID TO 200K LIKES! WE NEED MORE!!!!!
I LOVE your building style!! can't wait to see what's next!
An ancient tribe was taken out by something. An explorer is hired to find out why. As the explorer goes through the island they find weird shaped skeletons. The explorer finds a cave the locals have said is dangerous. The explorer looks into the cave and finds ancient demonic rituals. They are frightened and immediately run out. They fall asleep in a local home and has a weird dream. They see a man being dragged to the cave he saw. They wake up to near someone screaming outside. They check it out and see that the villagers have a boned their homes. As the sun rises the explorer contacts the employer and hears another phone ringing behind them. They check it out and see the man from they’re dream on the ground unconscious. They run away and see portals have erupted all over the island. This is all a random idea if you like it please like. If you want to add to it reply if you want.
Imagine the speedruns
your builds are WAY to good to not subscribe, tbh i hate that youtube forced me to unsub to you, since your content is way to good
i cant wait for the Bob Ross refrence
It would be ultra epic if it has custom villager mod
If you can put this in bedrock I will love you. We bedrock players  don't get that good of maps like this one
You should build an overgrown and abandoned jungle temple buried in a ravine in the jungle
Wow I wish minecraft developers would take inspiration from this absolute legendary builder.  Edit: I'm sorry if I sounded rude I was just complementing him.
You should add a destroyed village to make it seem like the nether was so horrible that they felt they had to destroy the village as well
This looks like it’s going to be phenomenal
Oh my goodness! How absolutely breath taking, I'm super excited to see what else you do. Perhaps in the desert you could do some Islamic/Arabic styled buildings. The church could even be transformed into a mosque. But that's just my Muslim inspiration, no matter what I'm sure it'll look awesome!
Nice
will the map include the bounding boxes for the structures for us hardcore farm-builders? Love the work it looks so good! Can't wait for it to be done. Also will you be doing the nether? Edit: Also a small suggestion (I didn't see it in the video, so if I'm wrong lmk) But one of the more helpful things on a ruined portal is the gold block, so maybe add one in somewhere? Just a lil thought. Been watching since the desert temple video, keep up the great work!
This is the Catan Minecraft combo I have been looking for all my life
WE WANT MOREEEEE!!! 🤧😭
Mojang call this guy
Is it me or does your right eye not have an eyelash?
kinda want this now
Why doesn’t he have eyelashes on his right eye
ure so talented....
Would this ever be available for download on console? I play on an Xbox, and would love it if I could get the map on it.
I have never been so impatient for the next episode...
That is one of the coolest things I’ve ever seen build
So cool
*L E G E N D A R Y*
When you aren't satisfied with Minecraft terrain and structures so you make an entire island with all the perfect things in it-
How did you make the world?? Like the base part, when you made the main island and chose the biomes? Please I’m BEGGIN’ 😖🙏
dAAAAAMNNN
Bro you deserve more subscribers then green boi
We need a part 2!! And a world download!
some ancient collection and task
I wish Minecraft would make some crazy mountains and like cool hills and realistic water
This idea is insane!!! Will this be a free world of a paid Patreon world!?
I love your builds!!! An idea for the biome with the canyon is a coal mine with hidden explosives. Also for the desert biome can you please incorporate cities/ villages cut into the mountains or underneath a temple have a civilization there? Just a suggestion and I can't wait to see the end!!😁
7:56
Deym I love it
Add a treasure hunt which will rickroll the player. 😂
Reminds me of a Catan board, but like, in a good way
Can u create the fortnite map in Minecraft
You should connect a swamp to the jungle biome and have it bleed into the ocean
I can’t wait to play this 😳🥺😗
Dope
My idea is to all biomes need a some kind of gods, kings, emperor, or titans. And nether too have some biomes.
Please add like modded mobs
OOYYY... don't stop, make more... I really like this project your making...
I need part 2
Please include the mega tiara biome as a smaller part of the normal taiga biome. It would be so cool to walk under the canopy of those enormous trees.
You could put a world tree in there!
minecraft would like to know your location
You deserve more viewer
Ok ok, so 1. I seriously admire your build style, and 2. LEGEND OF ZELDA REFERENCES, you earned yourself a Sub :3  Can't wait to see where you take this ^^
Trixy ISTG YOU ARE THE BEST! THIS IS SO GOOOOD!
I have been waiting for something like this for a while! I'll be following de development closely
that is absolutely absolutely absolutely beautiful. And youre criminally ignored by the community.  More power to you!!!
I turned on notifications just to see this amazing project. Keep it up!
Hey dude. Something was wrong with your subscrive button. It's red but luckily I fix it by turning it to grey.
i cant wait for it
Come on guys we can do it!!! We need a part 2!! 80,000 likesssssss!!!!!!
A pier is made of wood or concrete, a jetty is a concrete pier with natural holders surrounding it, or the same without the pier.
This is beautiful, and if you don’t upload it I’m going to cry myself to sleep for the next year.
Please make an underground village in either one of the biomes, or connects to all the biomes.  I'm a massive sucker for underground villages.
dreams doin his next manhunt on this map, good god you are insane at what you do, keep up the good work man :D
Him:making a whole 16,000 block island in minecraft  Me:struggling to make stick figure with a market
Very impressive. Would love to see your interpretation of a woodland mansion.
TrixyBlox, you are a major inspiration for me, and I always look forward to your videos.  I recently subscribed, and I’m glad I did.   I’m SUPER excited to see what you do with the rest of the map!   Thank you so much for taking so much time to build all of this!  It’s incredible!
Edited: sry he was taking inspiration from BOTW Is it just me or the placement of biome feels like the regions of Breath of the wild like mesa high mountain and desert like gerudo desert and highland in bottom left, mountains in north tundra forest like the birdmen village hyrule field a plain in the centre
I was gonna ask if theres more then i realized it was only posted 9 hours ago TvT
Sooo excited for this series!!!
This looks amazing!
I love the small builds and the fact that they don't look to outrageous , where you still can use this at your survival world and build some houses and not feel disappointed that they arent as big
I wish this could be on bedrock edition, but we all know that won’t happen
I can't wait to download the fully finished map
Is this ganna be in bedrock?
does the ocean monument have the bounding box to actually spawn guardians?
This will be the greatest map ever when it’s finished
Imagine mods being played on here, even more mind boggling.
Will the nether and the end be transformed as well?
Dammm Mojang needs to step up, theyre being dominated by masterminds
Mojang/Microsoft should really consider hiring you. This is absolutely awesome. Congratulations, I'm eager to watch the following videos.
put good loot in the  chest
6:53 "dummies you dummy
This make me do better and bigger things :D
Is there anyway for you to port it to ps4.
This is gonna be awesome!! The shape, size, and way that the biomes are split reminds me of Catan, which if you don’t know is a board game. Not to put a damper on your vision/creativity, but I would theme the world off of that. Also, again not saying you HAVE to do anything, but personally my favorite genre for pretty much anything is medieval fantasy, so I would also take a lot of influence from that such as Game of Thrones, Lord of The Rings, D&D, etc. This might be going to far but a great example for medieval fantasy architecture and overall vibe would be the Goblin Slayer series. Again, not saying that you HAVE to use any of my suggestions, this is just what I personally would draw from for inspiration and would try to make my world be. But that is the beauty of Minecraft
Let’s get this to 80 000 likes boys
When the world is sus
For this to be a truly survival experience include datapacks that autogenerate a custom tree when saplings grow (there is one)   https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/custom-trees-5081513/ https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/easy-trees-4562308/  These are some examples - datapacks are cool additions - find someone who can help
Is it just me or does his pillager outpost look like one of the Templar keeps from Assassins' creed?  Just me, okay, I'll see myself out then.
Kind looks like the hypixel Skyblock hub. Did he make it?
If theres a mountain theme village it should be with some sort of norse mythology
Love the concept man, amazing job
Botw flashbacks
Can you add animal mods to it because that would make it a lot better?
It would be cool if you baised the snow biomes Pillagers outpost off of the southern water tribe from avatar: the last airbender. With the fence you put around the outpost being instead a snow/ice barrier around the snow outpost.
When you are done, will we be able to download it? if so, will it be free?
This man is truly the best minecraft builder
This is amazing, like I could never make any of this and also is it just me or does this remind anyone of skyrim
I think there should be a graveyard behind the church
Since you asked for some suggestions, I think putting some massive bones from some sort of leviathan or giant monster in the desert could be awesome.  It could be especially cool if they have journal entries from an archeologist nearby, which could possibly lead to a giant cave with the monster’s skull inside and some kind of secret (more world-building? Treasure?)  This is an awesome idea Trixy! Just seeing your ideas makes my imagination go wild!
*why do I hear boss music?*
I don’t think i’ve ever been excited for a mc map like this
The village kinda looks lika hateno village from zelda botw
What if the dark forest is the root of evil or conflict in the world or houses a once prosperous town or kingdom maybe add sewers to it where you fight monsters
What i think you could do for the mushroom island is make like a golden cow shrine or something. Maybe make it like an ancient civilization used to worship the mushrooms. Also you mentioned other ways of worship while building the church. IDK. also love your stuff, keep up the great work 👍
bro if i could play this i would crash as soon and i join XD
The mushroom biome could have some sort of mushroom infested building
You’re a good builder usually it would take me like an hour to make one of those buildings or you probably doing about 10 minutes.
DUDE THIS LOOKS SO SUCK, I can’t wait to see how the rest of the map comes out :D
This map is as at least 12 2b2t owo's
Collab with jeracraft and make a build using 1.17 blocks and some building mods pls
how do you download the world?
Can you make a survival series inside that survival map
In the snow some Star Wars easter egg from the battle of Hoth would be neat
Minecraft truly is amazing.
Pause at 11:45 and look at the weels those are side ways slabs
this is magnificent! please do part 2!
It’s like Skyrim in minecraft tho
Amazing job Trixyblox! I am not good at building much of anything in Minecraft. Your builds are very inspiring though. Keep up the good work! I am curious of which biome you will work on next.
I think for the Mesa town you should add pillagers as the local townsfolk do to the fact that in general the Mesa town would be seen as a rather rough town
???😀😀😀Add some kind of pirate theme thing in the water like pirate outpost
Congrats on 1 mil!
I saw this and was really hoping it was like super old so I could instantly download it 😂 so to u got a sub today I guess
Mazes!!!!!
At half the video this was so good I dont even wana get any spoilers now, shut up and take the like. This will be EPICCC.
I just got an idee for the desert. How about a oasis with a littel secret like a buried treasure
Woooow
I AM ALREADY INVESTED IN THIS SERIES. you have the best mc builds and you inspire me with every video
it's like the five kingdoms but with more
For some reason i get such strong feelings of nostalgia whenever you say zelda botw.
FINALLY YOU HIT 1M!! This is POG!
Congrats on 1 million!
Guys let's name the places.
Imagine if he did a huge tree that connected every biome👁👁
Can't wait 4 the next episode 2 come out
This is AMAZING!!! You are so incredibly talented and I can't wait to see what you do next! Instant sub!
heres an idea use mods
Massive cave system that connects all biomes?
the world instantly reminded me of botw, glad to hear that he was inspired by it as well. amazing job, you've got a new sub
In the jungle section it would be cool if you mixed palm trees and created a coastal tropical village
Will it work for Bedrock poke edition ?😀😀😀😀 coooooooooooool
I don't understand how you are so damn dedicated. This must have taken so long. You deserve more than 80k liked this is just insane!
As someone that is inspired by Trixy and has my own YouTube, I just cannot comprehend how he manages to complete these builds so quickly. AND look how good everything looks! I swear he released his underwater kingdom video like last week lol
Pls don't make the world download Patreon only, if it's a 1 million subscriber special, shouldn't it be for EVERYBODY, not just people with their mom's credit cards?
Wagon was more for a wandering trader Ngl
Oh. My. F*cking. God. 0_0  I love this, please do more. ^_^
QUIKLY GET YOUR BOTS  WE GOTTA GET HIM TO 80,000 LIKES
Make me feel like I need to do so much better damn and I might have to get a pc these mods are crazy
Can you add a meteor creater for your survival map.
Oh, I'm SUPER excited about this! You're incredibly talented.
how are you so good!!!!???
Love your videos man
I'm so FRICKIN excited
Dude! You are so talented! The best I can do is a box.
Maybe you should do a build battle with Grian🙂
this guy would make a great dnd dm
I really do hope this becomes a series plzzzzz!!!!!!
TrixyBlox Is the BEST Minecraft builder I have ever seen.
His eyes tho
it would be so cool if trixy did a 100 days video in hisown worlds he makes
this man should be hired to design minecraft vanilla structures
This may not get into the world your making but I think a hidden wolf den pack would be interesting to see. It's up to you on what kind of story would involve this wolf den.
If I had this world I would be afraid to place anything or break anything 😂
What if a giant fox structure in the taiga biome that also inhabits a lot of foxes berry bushes giant fox statue? and a big fox den? Also will you be doing the nether and end for this survival world? and what about for the 1.17/1.18 update when the new world gen comes around would you be updating the map to play with the new height limit and depth limit?
i would love quests !
Given that the plains would have lotsa pastures and stuff, I woulda imagined it could have livestock-centric business as well until you said they were vegetarians and pescetarians (?).   SUGGESTION! Maybe you could have stables for selling horses in the plains as well?
Some sort of nomad thing like the Mongols or the Scythians would be cool, and a trade federation with some pirates would be nice. (Edit: Make some sort of demonlike Satanic worship society in the nether)
bro he went all out i mean you can make your own game bro like....😐😐😐
Can you convert that on Minecraft bedrock or mcpe ??????
ngl i would buy this map
You should add elven city
Please give this map for free. As it is 1million special Please give this map for free. As it is 1million special
Beautiful!!!
The Mushroom Island feels a bit too close to the main island. Maybe move it a bit further.
you should add references the lord of the rings the fellowship of the ring
Build a flying futuristic city that has not been affected like the other structures
You should make a secret cavern/cave/dungeon in the plains by the sea
AAAYY, you're like me! You just wanna make something cool, but always get obsessed with world-building and story!
Trix what if you put like a villager somewhere out in the snowy mountains and he has a quest that will take you across the whole map, on an epic treasure hunt, national treasure style
plains biome should have a big ravine
When you said the oak pillager outpost was a “temporary base” I was like “wow is he going to make a new version of woodland mansion?”
we need more.
BOB ROOOSSSSSSSSSS
Ooooooooo cool nice 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Yo you should add floating islands 🤯
You should add ice fortress
you should add pirate ship
THIS WAS WHAT WE ALL HAVE BEEN WAITING AND WISHING  FOR, OMGGGG
In the snowy mountains biome, add an AT-AT or 2 I'd love to see a star wars reference
im like the villagers peskitarian! great video and look forward to playing the map
Okay, don't want to distract from the amazingness.... But why are you missing your eyelashes on one eye? Or are they just blonde?
I’m angry at how good you are at building    JK I love the build so far 😀👍
The ship of black beard with an hidden treasure pls like so he can see
I have a question when you finish the map can you port it to MC 1.12.2?
most minecraft youtubers: 100 days series  This absolute legend: *Creates his own fucking universe in minecraft*
I want it to be included to be able to play on on mcpe so i more people can play it on ima sub u i forgot to sub u
Are you going to also make the nether custom? Just an idea, I understand it is already a huge project.
Youd think he would add a swamp biome, because its a biome and has some of its own structure but no
Yo, I got an idea. If you ever edit the world, maybe add a cemetery.  But seriously. You are truly talented my guy.
Yo, I got an idea. If you ever edit the world, maybe add a cemetery.
In 50 years this will be god level😃
I wanna play this so bad
i hope vanilla minecraft looks like this someday 🤞
So this is gonna be downloadable right
In the mushroom biome, you should build a fantasy village where the houses are mushrooms (like the Smurf’s)
we need this seed
Hey! I sent you a dm on instagram for some concepts.I was wondering if you could check them out
Just saw this on Reddit and didn't realize it was you, looks amazing so far!
This is literally breath taking... I love it
Wow
Watching you has made me want to build the world of "That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime"      Whether I actually follow up on that is a different story
Imagine minecraft creates a story and use this map as the original world, and give unlockable DLC's which are portals that leads to YOUR other projects. A whole game dedicated to you.  Love from Indonesia
You should ask to join hermit craft
A place where wandering traders come together would be a good idea
RESPECT IT bro😎
Do you think you could build something from star wars like Yavin base or a star destroyer
So, Sooo inspiring! Exactly what I needed to jump back into Minecraft once agin xD
*frick*
Can you add a giant spider
Give me the specs of your computer pls.
You should make mosques in the desert biome! This is absolute talent btw
the true main minecraft builder
Did I miss the blacksmith house? Wait...wait That's not it... I meant to say Where's the blacksmith?!?
Amazing
If you don't mind stepping away from Vanilla MC, you could use the Create Mod, that Mumbo Jumbo's getting into in order to animate the windmill, and maybe a few other things.
would be so cool if you had the mushroom island be home to a village of witches! maybe they were cut off from the rest of the island because they were too bloodthirsty or something?
Are you sure the world download shouldn’t cost money?
I don’t know if you’ve already planned the diaries but, here’s my idea. There could be one in the zombie infested village about this one survivor who thinks about running away to save their life. The journal could end with something like “Today is the day, I hope everything will be fine.”  There could be two outcome of their story. In  an other village we could find another journal about how they managed to escape or, never find any other journal about them.  I hope this could give you some ideas :)
Please add Atlantis or the famous lost city of Atlantic city.
The plains biome reminds me of the kingdom of Gondor in lord of the rings
Glad this was in my recommendations
I legit took 12 hours to build a church in creative and you just outdid me by 10000% in 30 mins
Imagine adding a town that worships potato’s😂😂
This is soo cool
I feel like the map villiger thingy is like the mayor
I wish I was creative talented as you man.  I can't even build a simple thing out of my mind .
So no swamps? *smashes* *phone* *and* *skateboard*
No swamp but still SUPER COOL 💃
I really wanna see a transformed woodland mansion!
You had better do more of this, I need satisfaction like this-
Can we download this map
Cant wait for the world download. The first thing ima do is use the create mod to turn the Farmer house into an actual windmill.
you forgot the blacksmith but this is nice
Hi im late sad
This looks great, man!
I wanna build like you
Why is he so much better than me at building 😭
I would pay up to 50$ for this mal no cap
here is a suggestion, take some inspiration from the WynnCraft server. The server has a ton of cool builds that could help you with your transformation.     Like if you agree
This reminds me of the ark map
I hope in this project change the dungeon spawner. Because, dungeon in vanilla minecraft is looks bad and no had story of behind the dungeon.
Some type of military camp please
What would happen to the nether and the end? I sure hope they stay the same especially the nether because it’s already hard to traverse.
This is really awesome! I can't wait for the rest of the biomes
An additional new series 😳 Very appreciative!!!
Ik I'm being selfish but as a 1M subscriber special gift, this build should be free hehe 😏
Is this gonna be available for Bedrock as well, or just Java?
Please add dwarves and/or a dragon in the mountains
Pillager lore please
For story each peace of land is claimed by different clans that are at war or they cooperate
i really hope there is some kind of ritual happening in a tribe that desires power. & that ritual could spawn a mob boss that could potentially cause HAVOC if not stopped
Add a cult in the swamp biome
Hey trixy, long time sub, I got a couple ideas myself if u would like to hear em :). For the snow biome I think it would be really cool to make a village almost like how Vikings lived, hunting for food in the snow, with tamed polar bears, ice fishing, obviously a big armory and such, with guard towers because Vikings fight unlike villagers. Also maybe the dark forest should have more story, like an abandoned castle/kingdom all zombies or dead. An ancient kingdom only talked about in legends. We have seen what you can do with castles mate, I’d love to see that. Anyways as always, keep up the good work man, even just watching this video gave me so many ideas of my own and I love doing what you do, except you do it better haha. Good work, everybody sub and like rn <3
Pls say can I play these world on pe
You are the best builder I have seen (is it okay if I use some of the designs in your village and use it in my world?)
You should add the armor stand mod so you can have villagers hunting in the jungle or doing stuff another biomes
Please please please pleaseeeeeee make this map work on bedrock
I watched the first thirty seconds of this video and had to pause it and ask you guys whether i should just wait and play the map without watching these upcoming videos to not spoil things? Cause this is just wayy too cool man
Awesome!!! Hope you will continue this:)
This is similar to wano of one piece.
Ok ok, so in the spruce wood biome you should make giant dead or stumped trees that have like a tower with a village behind it!!
I'm not sure if you were already planning this, but I'd love to see some more detail on the interior of things like desert temples. I've always thought that it should be clear what the temple is for, and right now it's more of "oh cool, I hope there's good stuff in the chests and I don't blow up"
If you’re going the extra mile, you might as well add fossils in the desert and maybe under the ground poking out in the mines or even just under the ground in general. Also, the church reminded me more of the temple of time in Ocarina of Time more than it did Breath of the Wild
Realizing he isn't taking actual real-world geography.
WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW I'M SO HYPED
WE NEED 80K
PLEASE MAKE THIS FOR BEDROCK. I WILL GIVE YOU ALL OF MY MONEY FOR THIS!
You should add something like the elephant graveyard in lion king
Can't wait for part 2
Thumbnail looks like among us
Early?
U deserve 10 million at least subs
holy moly thats huge
He forgot about the swamp biome
HYPEEEEEE!!!!!!
Hats off dude
Put a bunch of pop culture references in it like Skyrim
collab with forgelabs?
OMG CAN'T WAIT
I have an idea   Build a castle in a biome and add a underground facility where there is a giant mech there
Dang I wish there was a seed for this for bedrock. But good job! It’s rlly rlly creative and intuitive
I might have to do a 100 day series on this map.
Do you plan to do anything in the nether? As a crucial part of almost every survival world, I don’t think it should just be overlooked.
that's EPIC!! Good job !!
Swamp biome?
you should check out the quark mod for extra stuff for your world
Yo how about a skyrim type of civil war Or a Stark tower from avengers
Do one for bed rock to maybe 🤔???
I love your definition of slightly
This Map I Can Make SMP Of
After you finish the main world can you do the nether or even the end?
Awesome! Perhaps you can add some kind of haunted graveyard somewhere, with an ancient tomb and hidden treasure.
Holy fuck this is awesome
You should make a abandon mine below all of the biomes connecting them
there should definitely be an abandoned underwater/cavern village (perhaps carved out under the jungle)
There are minecraft casuals, builders, designers, godly builders, legendary builders, then there is trixy
Dude this is your best video that I've seen. Not too big, and not too complicated. Just plain old vanilla minecraft. It just fits so perfectly with the theme of the game.
the 80 dislikes are people who are jealous because they suck at building xD
this is sickkk
I wish I could get this world in bedrock Edition
I *CANT* wait for the next episode!!! Keep up the good work!! (1 sub earned)
im so excited for the map to finish I need this for my new smp
Wish Minecraft was realy that pogging cool!! WELL DONE !!!
How about for the snow biome you make a hidden temple of some dead tribe in the mountains and then you could tie that to another area
This is some lord of the rings type thing
Pls tell me this will be on PS4/5
49k likes in 7 hours let's go. Subscribed, liked and want to play
World download?
not even in creative am I this skilled 😱
Blacksmith
No swamp biome?
in the snow biome you should do like the mount everest
Lookin good
you should do a more fortified bigger town with walls in the plains, love the vids thanks for this.
Markets for the different biomes, a kingdom of some kind (like for chickens idk), festival/carnival, lords and serfs, overgrown gardens, broken statues and landmarks, an underground city, a flower field for bees (I love bees), stables, cabins, walled monuments, old caves overrun by monsters, a library or cathedral, port town with docks, houses customised for different biomes (like tree houses for jungle, bungalows or clay houses, a sleek marble city in the desert, etc), a light house, broken aqueducts, a courthouse or prison (dungeons), an abandoned forge, a cat village (just a tiny village. For cats), evidence of extinct animals (like giant footprints), a carpenter,  a waterwheel  These are just random ideas and I know they are all over the place, theme and concept wise😅, I just always loved the idea of creating a story in survival mode. Might add more later
You should have much more than a million subs, I try to do almost anything you do and I brutality fail. If you could make this a mod in the future (when you're finished), I bet my computer wouldn't explode and It would be the most fun in Minecraft I'll have for a while. Thanks!
It would take me forever to build that.
Will the world download be available in bedrock Minecraft?
Does it work on bedrock or tlauncher
what app your using to make custom caves please tell me🙏
Hey Oscar, this shit is FIRREEE!! Keep it up man 🤙🤙🤙
Will the nether also be transformed?
Alright who disliked
You should put abandoned carts around the map,and have like,the backstory of pillagers raiding the wagons and killing of the cleric
This is man is a mega Man thanks for this video
Could someone tell me where to find that software to edit maps like that? Thank you
I just don't understand how you don't have more then a million sub's, you have so much talent, I wanna be like you one day man, keep it up
Once you finish this insane transformation could you try do something similar in the nether with a giant lava ocean surrounding it and enhanced fortresses and bastions along with some added structures
How do I get this?
The church really does remind me of the Temple of Time, especially the transformed version! Edit: I so want to see the next episode and absolutely wan to to see a download. This is the content I subscribed for!!!
Put Arthur Morgan's grave on some of the grand canyon, just a little easter egg from rdr2
My guy got fed up with building single builds and decided to make a mmorpg
please like so we get the world down load
Will this be daily, weekly, or random?
TrixyBlox : you need a diamond pickaxe to do that. Water and Lava bucket : Allow us to introduce ourselves.
I really want to play this but whether it's finished or not I don't have a PC that can run anything other than Tetris...
this is very poggers
In the middle (the plain) there would be a giant God maby the God in the world to add more lore
PLEASE PEOPLE LIKE THIS VIDEO PLSSSSS
Great job can’t wait to see more
Can you put a futuristic village in an area
Me: yooo 16 thousand blocks is alot Trixyblox: nvm actually its 16 million blocks sorry guys
Hey trixy here are some suggestions! ice cavern bigfoot mega tree like in the swamp in avatar sex workers, somewhere (these places were very important in the wild west!) volcano, or underground lava cavern. lava river? fascism town of giants! In the sky? in custom clouds?? excuse for big builds :)
Oh god new smp.
1.try to add or upgrade a stronghold 2. try to upgrade the nether near the ruined portal 3. upgrade all temples 4.upgrade all trees 5. upgrade all villages 6. add a igloo and upgrade it 7.upgrade Ocean Monument 8.add and upgrade Abandoned Mineshaft 9.add and upgrade Woodland Mansions 10. Add some ores
Include a huge dead kraken in the sea some where in the ocean that has treasures and maybe diary's from pirates
What about the Nether?
Unreal
How about the nether and the end?
I love how he casually says that he builds much bigger even when that cathedral is not small by any means
My cat approves
Found you on Reddit, I have very high hopes for this project ;)
Use the transformation of the dessert pyramid in the dessert biome it'll be cool
11:59 this pleases me greatly.
I think you should have a buried WW2 style bomber plane in the desert.
I'm now imagining about someone actually making a 100 days of survival in trixy's custom world
I NEED THE REST OF THE EPISODES!!!!
Trixy: “I’m transforming everything in Minecraft!”  Grain: *confused screaming*
Another Idea. A monastery in a mountain (Maybe, since you can add other different types of churches)
Im still liking cause i like you😚, even tho i cant get the world download cause im on mcpe😔
So excited to download this map. Are u planning on adding a stronghold???
Why does the picture of the island at the beginning look like a rabbit throwing up
Ok a idea the desserts biome has a srecrit Odin under it and it it alatis
I’m excited for the mooshroom island and the Mesa biome! They seem like interesting designs.
I'm to a Minecraft legends I'm a boulder speed runer science and prefrontal
This is amazing. Thank you for making it.
When You Feature the Mountains, Put a House in Bavarian Style Up there
Add a hidden kingdom in the mountains
Everyone please like the video
Seeing this, I subscribed!
The desert temple you made would be a great addition to the project
The stronghold should be somewhere unique like the center of the tallest mountain or under a private island
there is a mod for the beekeeper
Do like that to the nether too pls U so cool
My guy just went ahead and started making Minecraft 2
You really should have added all 69 biomes
Maybe create a custom villages in every biomes
Who would dislike this god of a world?
Could you make this an SMP, please?
Keep up the good work
Suggestion: add a giant tree on the Jungle biome. add Villager near the giant tree like they protecting the tree from someone Make the tree glowing, give the tree like life force (the tree gives the world life, and the villagers who live there are guarding it)  *just a cool idea with a bad english* Reply me or something if you cant read it
Idea:how to build better in minecraft
amazing
I don't even have the patience to do this
Do part 2 please it will be so so so so so so cool
"Maybe even a Bob Reference..."
Can you add wood land mansion
What if you and grain did a build off. Hmmm
Idea for one. A deserted warzone
Can you build hidden City in desert
When you are making the village maybe you can make like stores
i really have problem making maps in worldpainter. I know that never has been any fovus of your vids, but i i like the way you make maps. would love to 1 day see some sort of vid whit focus on world painter :)
I haven’t played Minecraft in a very long time and i cannot wait to reinstall it to experience this world in the first person. Amazing
Ideas: Custom weapons, custom biomes, custom dungeons
I wanna see the rest
Maybe in the badlands biome there could be large bones or skulls to symbolise some large creature that used to live there
Build a stone hedge with a beacon in the middle!
a bever dam mabey idk where it would go but eh
Make it a server
Just one question tho. Have you added cats to the villages? I can't play Minecraft well without my legion of cats in my home
This is minecraft god, bow to him
I would totally play this map.. if I could play it without my PC exploding
2:47 Upgrade The Nether, And I Have An Idea For That, That The Nether Overworld Portal Its Conected The Same Portal And In The Same Place, But In The Nether, And That The Nether Will Be Like The Overworld Island, But Like In A "Mirror World" And That In The Same Places That Are The Biomes, In That Place Will Be The Nether Biomes
genshin in minecraft be like
I think an End Portal could be hiding in a cool temple in the Tundra would be really cool, and you can get all the ender eyes you need through side quests you pick up as you explore the Map. I'm thinking heavy BotW theme for this kind of stuff, but I'm looking forward to what you do.
A planes village turned onto a city with walls and an entrance for the rail road
I think that it would be awesome if there was a giant graveyard in this world or maybe some hints that there was a massive war in the past. I just think that would add a good storyline to this world.
CAN I DOWNLOAD THIS MAP!!?!?!???
Dude this is dope. Please make more!!!!!
Are you going to make a custom  Nether and/or End too or just the Overworld?
Definitely getting this when it’s ready for download!
GUYS, MAKE IT SO WE CAN DOWNLOAD IT.
how long did it took
Has a additional defense you add a smaller outpost okay I am not going to question further maybe
This video summed up in two words: Hypixel Skyblock
YOO IMAGINE WORLD GENERATION WAS LIKE THIS
Maybe make the church of the dessert village a mosque or a pyramid so it can be either Arabian or Egyptian, and a sacrificial table for the jungle village so it can be like Aztec or Mayan style.
So far, this is shaping up to be absolutely gorgeous
On the wild west biome make a abandoned church and 2 or 3 houses trixy
#jackscoolthings
Dang dude that’s epic
Legendary...
Shipwreck?
The new elder scrolls map??
I think you should add giant stone statues of animals that represent the biome like jungle can be am omelet and the mushroom biome can be a mooshroom cow ect.
I have and idea for you it could be one of your biggest project yet you could make the entirety of the us
Are you missing eyelashes in your right eye? Was it always like that?
Wait... Do you only have eyelashes on one eye 👀 also scrumch Minecraft mmmmm
Please make panda village from film Kungfu Panda_/\_
Next is what biome A Jungle B Dark Wood Forest C Savana D Taiga E Snowy Moutian F Mesa G Desert H Mushroom J Ocean
Idea:Bosses and more? Or bandits and black market?
If you can maybe can you try and put this for console, don't worry if you can't. Also an idea for your dessert map you can put a bank with hidden chests with gold, silver and emerald blocks in them
Pity that we console users won't be able to play this once it's complete :,(
put in a bunker that accidentally set out the zombie virus, that eventually infected the village
Anything inspired by botw is win
Dungeons, DuNgEoNs, DUNGEONS!!!!!!!!!
Can't believe he actually took the time to build this thing
I watch these kind of building videos to get inspirations for own Minecraft Worlds. Great idea with this huge project!
whats da world link. im tryna import it
80K
Sadly I can't play it in bedrock
YOOOOOO
Good luck on making this type of builds
I can't wait to play that map ! Thanks man, I appreciate your talent and dedication
Commenting for the algorithm 👍
I really want to play this, looks amazing!!!
If I would say the ruined portal is quite good but the stairs are much more in the good side it's called the ruined portal right? So I'd have the stairs a little bit on the ruined side as well cause you know it's a ruined structure......
Mysterious beings and infected villages to Bob Ross References. absolutely beautiful
Man I can see this map being a minecraft RPG where you fight easy mobs at the beginning and unlock new zones (the biomes) with new mobs and bosses etc. There could be also secret zones at the far end of the RPG like the mushroom biome where only level 99 players can enter or idk
This map is absolutely astonishing! I can’t wait until it’s finished.
Swamp “Trixy was never my friend.”
🔥🔥🔥
This dude could probably finish a continent minecraft 1:1 alone
this is next level
bell towers are not a great idea for survival minecraft... villagers are gonna get stuck in their way to the bell
you forgot the shrek swamp???
Add a giant footprint in the snowy biome or in every biome cause if it's on every biome it will look like some giant is hiding or protecting the island
I absolutely love watching all your builds. You Trixyblox are a true builder for minecraft and have pure talent. Can't wait to see what all you do here. I'm excited!
Finally, a map I won’t get lost in lol
Can we get forge labs to play this when it's done?
man this is amazing
someone should make this an adventure map with a bunch of command blocks so it would be a lot like breath of the wild
Add A Statue To The Village!
I know it's not an actual thing in vanilla minecraft, but you gotta add a lighthouse near the ocean XD
Am actually new on here immediately I saw Robert Smith posted @Hackerjone6 on telegram just 15 minutes ago. So I contact him  on telegram immediately I saw the post on here and I see that it's real and not really scammer, so I thanks God for today and thanks hackerjones for saving my life.
I feel like there might be a trend of you tubers and streamers playing the finished product.
What a about a shop in your inventory so when you are lost you can use the shop to buy like elytra so when you're elytra dies you can get a  new one
Just watching the map being created was amazing! I can’t wait to see the whole thing!   Also this makes me want to play Skyrim
A “quaint” windmill.
TrixyBlox can I pay you to build me something?
Yo this is crazy! Can't wait to see what it looks like when it's done.
I love seeing ur videos
Will it be downloadable in bedrock edition?
maybe add some traps in the dark wood forest? like animal traps,
Can you pls make a Greek themed village without using World edit
"a quaint windmill would fit perfectly" *proceeds to build the biggest windmill ive ever seen*
Unreal, so fucking cool
Can’t wait for the rest
O M G what a HUGE project :o How couldn't I subscribe???  Don't forget the nether/end structures for the full world experience, as well as the underground structures like the stronghold mineshafts and spawners! (which could have relatable caves for each mob, just a suggestion xD)  Good luck with the project! 100% waiting for the world download!!!
ShReKS SwAmP PLz!!11!!!
That map is *BUSSIN*
who were the 68 people that disliked. I dont get you
You had me at “Bob Ross reference”
You should make in the snowy area a ginourmas castle and cave, so you can have a king under the mountain and if you really want to go lord of the rings add a dragon in there and all this could be lore for the map
lmao i saw your reddit post and thought someone stole your thumbnail, then i looked at the user
put in shreks swamp please!!!
Maybe you could add an underground ice palace in the snow biome?
This is amazing! I always wanted to play a survival world like this
Right now when I’m making this comment there’s 44k likes (smash like!)
For the mountainous area there should be a large cave which houses a dragon nest
80,000 likes please i want the full world and download :(
Where is the *ravines*??
Why does this look like a Minecraft Ultimate map? (I think that’s what the event is called. If I’m wrong then the Minecraft hunger games thing.)
This is awesome I love this!
Be sure to place a bell anywhere you want the villagers to treat as a meeting space! They will gather near the bell every afternoon if you do.
I want build a medieval house next to the village
:|, watch, man's gonna make the whole minecraft earth with land
this map is...... legitimately imposing. Like, i'm in AWE of this map, cause it's 1: Gigantic, 2: Epicly designed, and 3: beautiful.
It would honestly be sick if you just made this super tiny hidden entrance that led to this GIANT underground ice cave as a secret
You should make mods
I feel like the traveling merchant (cleric) in the village would appear in the wild west town since it has a wagon, if would be a good part of the story.
I was just thinking before he said it that it looked like the temple of time😂
Indiana Jones Dungeon Temple in the Jungle!!!  Do It! :3
Imagine placing millions of trees and then you just replace them- thats a lot of extra work. 😭✊💖💖✨💖
Why are his eyelashes on the right eye gone
Ok I'm so hyped to download the completed map when it's done!
Will it be available on bedrock?
Also so excited to see the next video!
Include among us pls
we have to get this video to 80,000 LIKES
people who died yesterday didn't get a chance to see this  it makes me cry, really
looks like a warcraft map tbh
like it, just do it.
Dude this is awesome! I love it and can't wait to see the rest of the map!
THIS KINDA STUFF IS WHY I SUBBED, PURELY AMAZING CREATIONS! Freakin love this stuff keep up the great work man.
when u realize he’s doing this all with just some cubes
I’d like it if you made a mineshaft maybe near the mountains and it leads to a secret base filled with all sorts of mobs and lore.
Can this world be downloaded?
PLEASE DO THIS AGIAN THIS IS AWESOME!!!!!
WOW
well in another village particularly one of the cold ones how about you have beetroot be their main crop as it's not everywhere you can grow wheat and potatoes too easily. For the jungle tribes I would imagine they're living off the fruits of the jungle so cocoa beans, fish, boar, and flowers. Since those tribes are also fighting how about having some with dogs. Expanding upon the jungle how about a volcano and have one of the tribes worship a deity that comes from it? For the Mesa. if there is a pillager outpost, give it some horses and horse stables as that's what's common out there in the Wild West times. I would say for the snowy mountain instead of just doing a village on the surface how about a cave dwelling village that live in the mountains as both of them had a quarrel one year and half of the folk went down the mountain in search of an easier and more prosperous life and the other half stayed continuing to stay with their meager supplies to survive. For the dark oak forest it would be perfect for some shady people to hide as well as those persecuted on the works of magic to hide. Perhaps even scientific research is done in secret in the dark oak forest. This could also be applied to hiding in the Taiga where terrain is tough to navigate. Expanding upon these ideas could be another nether portal as a magic experiment gone wrong in the researcher's basement and opened the gateway to the nether inside.
this is litterally SO AWESOME! I’m very excited to play!!!
place the map for download
try to make custom cave systems.
Can you customize the nether and end as well?
this is actually super epic, I've been dying for a good survival adventure map and this is exactly what every bored Minecraft players waiting for the update needs. super excited cant wait to download this!!!!! love ur builds
You could build a secret island that you have to make some sort of mission in each biome to get the map to get there. And with a big reward in the secret island. That would be cool
Hey Trixy I have a challenge for you. Creating Middle Earth form hobbit and lotr of the rings, you have the skills, I think it would really be cool. 😃
i need to play on this map
Dam man just made ark map
Yall we best be getting this to the like goal cuz im hyped af for this series! Super cool trix loving it so far
You should create a custom nether that's 1/8 the size of the island and has all the nether biomes
You should make the nether better if it's gonna have a small back story, but remember to break the portal when you're done with it
Imagine trying to do something like this in bedrock edition...
“Lets not get crazy with the plains biome”  I don’t think he knows what crazy means..
I WANNA GET THE MAAAAP!
It sounds stupid but could u add a really cool horse place idk how u would but it would make me happy when I am able to play mc 🔥🔥🔥🔥
42k likes so far in 1 day-
ive never wanted to live in minecraft more than I do now
Perhaps you could add a massive ravine in the ocean? Also enhance the nether
Am I tripping or did TrixyBloxs eye on the left side of the screen look like it had no eyelashes, in the outro :0
That’s totally insane i can’t wait to play on it omg
The subscribe button has been hit.
This gets a sub!
Sicko mode building.
This inspires me to build something different than a 5x5 house
Mojang needs him
You should also add a secret end portal room with laboratories or something
After watching so many create mod videos, I half expected the windmill to start spinning! 😅
After seeing this, I just had to subscribe.
Urgh!
It would be cool to get in some custom music tracks for your beautiful map. There could also be powered minecart rails you can unlock for fast travel. You should make a custom nether and end along with adding modded ore so that people will play this map a lot longer. This map should also have side quests like hunting down an enemy quota or completing a challenge within a time limit.
when this map is finished, i'm absolutely going to play on and explore it
Would be awesome to have a giant dragon sleeping deep inside the montain
Suggestion: Some kind of yeti cave in the mountains.
Can this world be available for Minecraft Beta plz make it available when it's out🙏🏻and I love the idea 👌🏻
You should add a mangrove forest /swamp
This is massive!!
The portal looks like the one in world of Warcraft
This. This is talent.
Yooooo please can this get 80,000 likes!!! I really want to play on this map with my friends! Edit: also you got a new sub.
can this be downloded on bedrock
SO AMAZING! And does anyone ever notice how nice the clouds are?
should have 10 mil
I didn't play Minecraft for YEARS now, because i know it to well but DAMN  if you let me download this map I'll play it INSTANTLY. Handmade work is always better than any other casual generation of computer, even with the greatest mods. Keep it upp❤❤
In the other biome villages it would be very cool to see you build some custom walls to keep the Pillagers out!
Amazing! what if you make a reference to something legendary from minecraft, like Notch!
It would be cool if you'd make a data pack that makes the eyes of ender uncraftable, and than you have them all scattered around the island in for example the Ocean Monument or some custom biome themed dungeons. Your Main Quest on the Island would than be to find all these and defeat the ender dragon!
Maybe there could be a floating, Olympus-like island above the tallest mountain... ?
alternate title:copy and paste on crack X10
Can’t wait to actually play on this map. 😩
Can’t wait for the next part! Love the details!
I really love how the island is coming along and I hope you can finish it
This is wild and amazing
Make a fleet of pirate ships pls, thx            :D
Can someone tell me how to download world stuff like this on console cuz i would love to get this world on console when its done
I think it would be nice to put pagan shrine into dark oak vilages since you want to make it zombi village.
maybe a caslte runis out in the feldie and a bio temple plus a redstone lab
It's amazing! I can't wait to see the finished project! Keep up the good work!
Just add a dragon , for the memes lol
This would be a good world for an SMP
i want to see what you do with the woodland mansion.  Other than just build a big mansion in a Dark Oak Forest.
I think I'm in love. Absolutely the best ide, video and builds I have ever seen. Can't wait for the rest!
It’s only at 41k likes? Upgrades people, upgrades!
And so do other people and ITS SO COOL
40k likes in 5 hours wtf
PLEASE say this is not just going on patrion because I don't have a patreon
Add an ice fortress
There should be a series of diaries made by a mysterious author who was trying to figure out the secrets of that world
If I download this I’m turning that pillager outpost into my base.  I wanna see a part 2.  Is this downloadable on pocket addition.
This map reminds me of ARK
This is so sick!
Speaking of breath of the wild you should totally make that in Minecraft that would be siiiiiiiick. Like if you think he should
Damn that world is smooth. I mean look at those mounyains
🔥
This is amazingggg!
Yes!!! I LOVE THIS! especially the inspiration from the BotW map! I can not wait, will def buy when you are done! 💚🤎
Forgot the swamp :(((((
Woooooahhhhh thiss iss bangerrrrr
Make a floating sky island in the map, maybe. That'll be good for adventures
i think you should do a the mesa next i would really like to see how you make it
based from the thumbnail I thought this was the playground from crosscode lol
I am sooooo excited!
THIS IS THE COOLEST THING IVE SEEN SOMEONE DO
For now, I'm sure I'll just download it with just a few questions about what version to finish 1.16* or 1.17*?
Aepic map  Im not insulting him its just unique go say epic as aepic
TINY
🐟🐟🐟Fishy with da drip
Wow ! Really really really good Builds !
I feel TrixyBlox has helped create one of the maps on Hypixel
I absolutely love this. I really hope the map download comes out for free and bedrock compatible. Love your work Trixy!
This is awesome
Im LOVING this series, cant wait for the western part!
It looks amazing! Although I was quite disappointed with the market area since it's relatively small and insignificant compared to other buildings in the area, which it shouldn't. Perhaps you could highlight the area not only by adding different kinds of stands with different colors and all, but maybe even building a small jousting area as well
im so glad this came up on my recommended! this is sick i cant wait to see more! *subscribes*
💡Some ideas to fill the empty spaces in the world:    • Entrances to dungeons/the stronghold hidden and lost to time. Maybe some custom dungeons that you can duplicate around the world?    • BOTW-style puzzles that reward the player for figuring them out (observers under grass blocks work well to detect “player placed block in spot X”, but I’m sure there are plenty of other puzzles the community can help out with if you’d like a redstone assist 👍)    • Ruins of old villages and towns, now just broken stones and half-collapsed arches    • Ravines and caves for easy access underground    • Ponds and lakes, with stepping stones and small fishing spots     • Cattle ranches, surrounded by fence and tended to by a single farmer living in his house    • Graves/shrines dotted in areas far from where they should be    • An old battlefield, with small opposing camps left to ruin  If anyone has other ideas for the spaces between areas, comment them below!
A massive Yggdrasil type structure would be epic!
would this be available for Playstations?
My mind is literally just fucking blown. I cant even make my own house look good in minecraft
Me watching this video: This is amazing! Also me realizing he didn't put in any caves: Oh 😯
A custom version of the nether mabye?
Want.
I love the idea of the pillagers temporary base maybe you could create a normal home base
Barely even a few seconds in and I can already tell that this will be one of it not your greatest project of all time! This is exactly what every survival player needs!
Will this world be available on Bedrock edition? Specifically PS4.
Creat a underground dwarvin city accessible from an abominable snowman lare in the mountains
insane
everyone lik!
*sees thumbnail*  Everyone else: circle world?? Me: Millennium Falcon world pog
My request is for you to re-create the Lost Settlement from Minecraft Dungeons in the snowy mountain.
I so wanna play thisss 😍
Trixy or someone should try and speedrun this map lol
Imagine having a war on that thing
It feels a bit empty, but it still looks sick
The first pillager outpost went from outpost to a pseudo castle
This.  Is.  AMAZING! Wow, this looks insanely good and I would love to see the whole thing upgraded!
I LOVE YOU!!!! <33333
Realised I miscalculated the size of the map a little, it’s actually 16,000,000 blocks 😅
This guy is disgustingly underrated give him 100,000,000 subs now please
No matter the world/seed, I still suck
When an amazing idea! I love this.
this is fire bro
Nice!
This is sooo cooll👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
You're almost halfway there on the like goal and the first day of having the video out isn't even over yet.  I predict you will make it there by Monday.
Damn this is amazing! I am very eager to see your next part of the biomes build! :D
fucking hell
Don’t forget the caves!
Next video: "I created the universe in Minecraft. My creations will worship me or go to hell."
This reminds me of Tamriel
0:00        Amogus
am i crazy to think it looks like an hunger games arena
Can we download it?
trixy and jeracraft should collab
Mojang watching this like 😶✏📒
Can we Download the map plssss
"me just sitting there for 5 minutes after he said how big it was" " also me 6 years ago thinking my 100 x 100 blockhouse was huge" you truly are a legend.
Yo. Why cant vanilla minecraft look like this by default. This is amazing.
"Spanning across 16,000 blocks" "4000x4000" 4000x4000 is 16,000,000
I think someone should make a mod that generates worlds like this
One questions....in world builder..dose it automaticly add ores orrrrrr.....
Wait will this have caves and stuff like that or no?
biome specific structures in each biome jungle temple in jungle woodlan d mansion in dark oak forest
do you want to make survival home for newbie
This is gonna be insane!
Well the youtube algorithm will like this
Ow my godddd this is epic.... jeez detication is limitlezs.... who said minecraft boring...well think again....
🤯
This is sick!!!!! Please tell me it’ll be free money’s super tight right now as I’m trying to upgrade all my things (pc and consoles), and life expenses
This is insane!!
Desert should have a hidden village in the sand like it was lost 2 time
In the desert you could do an underground sand village like the one from star wars.
Super cool video
This is beautiful
Such a great video!!! So glad I waited this long!!!! I can't wait to play my own and try to be good builder like you! But you are insane!
I think chinese will destroy that Contenent for resources
You should add a giant illager city in the dark oak forest, with woodland mansions, pillager towers and a great wall. There would be vindicators as citizens, evokers as wizards or cleric and pillagers as warriors. That would be very cool.
This video alone earned my sub. Mad respect for taking on such a project.
Could be cool if the boats where in attached to the instead of flowing in the water. Looks cool tho 👌.
You. Are. Fucking crazy. This map is so, I don't even know what to say, just wow
I think it would be cool if the world have some type of air ship attached to the ground in the snowy mountains
Pog!
Inspirational for the outpost I may do that
i cant wait for the playthroughs
secret massive underground crystal cavern be like?!?!?!??!?!?!
You deserve way more than 1 million. Amazing job and can't wait to see what you do next. Take care Trixy.
So idea I've had since I was very young tribes of people that live in the mushroom biome but they live underground inside of caves
You should add heaven and hell
Nice
him- come on lets make a 1Bxm blocks of a world Me- how do you make a costom world
Hey, what’s up with your right eyelashes? Where did they go lol
I noticed you put shop reck on the map you should try to make like an old battle with a whole bunch of sunken ships
I shoulda started my smp on this  We would have ruined it with perimeters tho
it's just hypixel skyblock LOL
Congratulations on a million! Joined you at about 30k
(Futurist idea)  Make a Militar base in the desert If you wan't to do it older just make an asirian,roman, griege base.
Bro you made an amogus map what have you done
nor would grian do so much work
This is so cool! You should make it for all consoles! Including the older consoles.
Making things more messy seems to make them more interesting and up to interpretation. That's why I like the boulders of the plains so much, they bring that flat zone of land to a place that's varied and messy.
Does anyone else think the island looks kinda like Metru Nui from Bionicle?
Trixy. i'm new here can you remake the neither too? you should ;)
Will you be adding ores???
This project is EPIC, although can you make 2 downloads? 1 with the lore and 1 without because it would be cool to use one for a story map kinda thing and the one without for a multiplayer server with my friends!
when building plains village, you just see the farmer, still endlessly farming in the feilds, no time in the mill :(
*coughs* errm mojang hire this man *coughs*
can you plz send the seed of that worlded
WHY CAN'T MINECRAFT LOOK LIKE THIS NORMALLy. IT'S EPIC LIKE THIS
He is too good
Remember guys 80k likes
00:02 Did you mean 16.000.000 blocks (4.000x4.000)? (The map looks absolutely awesome btw!!)
Liked, subscribed, and here's a comment. I really wanna play this map on a modded playthrough! 😍
What about the Nether?
Mountain lodge or Inca village for mountain biome
I need this to get to 80k
Tering zeg
If this would be a server it would be so cool
I have an idea        How about you make a house for the player, or Steve because he is the only thing like him in that world that resembles a human and can pickup and place down blocks
PLEASE TELL ME, HOW CAN I PLAY THIS WORLD ?
Wow, Microsoft should give u a job modifying their shitty MC lol. Your view of MC structures is way, way better!
i know this is cursed but the thumbnail kinda looks like amogus
What about a pillager Fortress in the Snowy Biomes(like Vikings)This is pretty much the main base of the pillagers. Story: Pillagers find something with great value that is only found in the snow biome so they kidnap villagers after their raid and force them to hard labor with pain and cages. That's when you come in and save the villagers from the fortress. Surrounded by 5 pillager watch towers pillagers around every corner. Do you have what it takes?
We nEEeeEed 80k likes
Can’t wait to see the rest of this!!
great dude. art. nice nice. nice to be able to follow this work, :) eager to see the upcoming ones (and what about the nether and end? :D)
Amazingly awesome!
How did someone find something this great worhty of a dislike
Could you also make a link for bedrock?
God loves you guys!
Maybe make some holes in the stairs to the portal
One of the secrets should be the  l'manbreg flag
I wish you could mack a underground anchant builder civilization under all the biomes coneted by tunals and i wish you do it on xbox so all of the xbox players could help and i could give you ideas for the builder civilization ps my username is wasteland heroo and plz make the main underground civilization city in the plans biome
You should add  a local mine for ores. And also make a wandering trader spot idk how it's made but perhaps with command block to spawn him there every morning with different trades every morning.
Trixy you should make a hidden shrek shack
transform the nether also
the only thing i think your missing for that village was the well but other then that awesome build and hope to see more
make part 2 i wanna see the mesa and the jungle, my 2 fav biomes
You should make an smp server with this map, that would be really cool
I dare you to add all the Structures you changed in your past villages
Cave in the mines that connects to a giant castle the multiple mobs that's what the fight we are fighting all of them you could get treasure stack of 64 diamonds
When he made the trees and places them I thought of BOTW then he mentions that it was inspired by it seconds later xD
Man, I kinda want you to build the nether biomes and nether villages.  That would be so awesome.
...So Red Dead Redemption 2 without guns
Congratulations, you are the best builder YouTuber, and you forget the swamp biome. 🎂
the only bad thing about this video is that it's only 15 minutes long
Maybe add some ARG elements in the ocean monument? Like ciphers and such?
update for 1.17?
You should make the nether look cool too
Sheeeeeeeeeesh
Transform the nether Pliz
An oasis paradise in the desert would be cool!
Add ores in the snowy mountains like ore spikes in some stone
GET OUT OF MY HEAD GET OUT OF MY HEAD
Make sure you give the villagers jobs so trading is possible. I noticed you didn’t do that as much.
Trixxyblox: remaking the whole of minecraft making it look Amazing*  Me: can’t even made a dirt house*
yo I did the same but in a much smaller scale! Was really fun building in so many different styles :) Im exited to see what you will build in the other bioms, the plain one looks awesome tho!
This is very cool
Biggest video in trixy blox ever let's go viral so he could do another biome
Bro Grian is quivering right now
I already did that by putting on amplified worlds   B  )
Wow that was amazing °o° !!! I also have an idea for the winter biome, where you should do a Japanese style temple, I think the contrast in colors would look really cool. Or make it out of ice? I'm not sure but whatever you come up with will look great no matter what!
This is awesome, congratulations on 1 million subscribers!
So cool! I can’t wait to see where this goes!
Wouldn’t 4000x4000 be 16 million?
Bob Ross reference!!!!
This world is the one that fits the feel of Sweden remix
"Spanning over 16 thousand blocks." 4000x4000 Me in pain: 4000x4000=16 Million not 16 Thousand...
U make my day love the builds
i need part 2 to continue life
In the wild west town for a secret could u add doc browns blacksmiths hut from back to the future 3
acheivement acquired "serious dedication !"  you builds are amazing and congrats on 1 mil subs ;)
Could you sell it on the Minecraft bedrock edition store too? That would be sweeeeeet.
i wanna see a massive castle :D
Minecraft needs to hire this guy for their building
Very cool, liking this build so far
Wow
I feel like something that could be added any wear is some sort of village that is one with nature and is a farming village, another one that is just like a normal one, and lastly one that is more futuristic and more advanced maybe even have an island in the sky
This could be a cool pokemon region
A dragon lair under the ocean monument area Anywhere really
I was Thinking to Myself, "This is kinda like Breath of the Wild in Minecraft!"  THEN YOU MENTIONED BREATH OF THE WILD!! MY FAVORATE GAME OF ALL TIME  edit: AHHHH, HE MENTIONED THE TEMPLE OF TIME!!!!
I love it, I can't wait to play on it!
Congratulations for one million subscribers, man!
Cave-system inside the mushroom island
this is so COOL!. you should leave some vanilla trees in the plains so people don't have to cut  down the beautiful custom ones
*WARNING* if you have megalaphobia don’t watch this video
No swamp biome RIP
1. Add a few birch trees to break up the oak 2. Make a destroyed colesseum in the snow biome 3. Add a Shrek reference in the swamp
This is amazing, can't wait to see the next Ps. Here from R/ old video
I absolutely LOVE the village but i feel like its a bit too much foresty looking, i feel like it needs to look more like plains maybe by getting rid of the bee woods thing idk, i love this idea it looks really good so far. You could maybe add a volcano island off the shore too just to look cool.
Mojang REALLY needs to hire this guy ASAP.
Make sure to put snowmen in the snow biome... Or else 🙃
I got a bit of an idea I know that this is kind of obvious but tega or Spruce Biome could be longhouses Viking
JEEEZUS CHRIIIST HOW DO YOU HAVE SO MUCH TIME ON YOUR HANDS?!?!!!!?!?!?!?!!??????!!!!!!
How would we download it on ps4 xbox are we able to or not
When he said a railroad, my hopes got high. Can't wait to see what amazing engine he builds!
ADD HIM TO HERMITCRAFT SEASON 8!!!! LETS GET THIS MESSAGE TO XISUMA
I think a pillager castle would look great in the icy mountains (or an derelict castle due to the mysterious monster)
This looks like it’s gonna be one of your best projects yet. I’m excited to see where it goes. Keep bustin out these videos man
Will the woodland mansion and the bigger monuments like the ocean temple also be updated?
You should have put a wandering trader in the wagon
It would be cool to see the Pillagers have at least one outpost in each biome where a village is present. You could think of it was the Pillagers owning each biome where a village is present, where you have to go liberate the respective region.
I will only suggest one thing. Can you pleas add a sign. Hidden anywhere saying just 2 words. "Engineer gaming"
Ngl love this idea I might do it in my free time just WAY scaled down also ngl would be kinda cool to see Elsas castle in the snowy mountains ido why lol ❤️ keep up the amazing work your so talented (Edit part) also maybe a castle somewhere maybe even a ruined castle like Breath Of The Wilds Hyrule Castel
Did anyone else check how long ago this video came out just to see if you could go to the finished product
This is so cool! I Can’t wait for the Mesa biome upgrade! :) 💕
Will there be caves?
you can't "upgrade" what is already perfect
You should add an abandoned cabin in the snow mountains and some random ruins (made of their biome specific blocks) across the map to add further mystery.
Custom nether and end
This is so underrated I can’t believe you haven’t even gotten 5 million, although you deserve 10 million!!! This is insane you dive all your work and effort into these projects yet such a little group of people watch your videos, I can’t believe this... keep up the good work, I love your videos and I thought maybe as idea to fill some space at the Mesa biome is to put a Wandering Trader Outpost, always wanted to know where Wanderings traders came from..
Hey, I just wanted to say you're an amazing builder!  Unfortunately I'm not in a position at the moment be able to join your Patreon yet, as I had some pretty bad luck financially recently. But hopefully in the very near future I will be able to join it. What you do is extraordinary!
Great Idea: Add Animals Like, Giraffes, Elephants, Maybe Crocodiles And Sharks Hunting In The Water, Tigers And Lions (if u like idea like so he can see)
I think it would be really cool to add an underground marketplace with huge crystals! A magical marketplace! Of course, it wouldn't be easy to find and have a secret entrance...
Ahh it looks so good!!! I could just live in the plains forever!!!
it would also be cool if u added wander trader carts around the map that had an Oregon trail style
Could you do a customer nether and end to?
In the game Minecraft considers the “church” a stronghold
Woodland mansion??
You should upgrade the overall terrain by adding some spruce slabs to make the terrain in the plains to look more smooth
my name exclusivly on a sign hidden somewhere on the map because tommorow is my bday. Reply so i get my answer thats what i want to be added to the map
Will there be a stronghold? Possibly a super upgraded one like you did with the village?
please say ur gonna make videos on the other biomes, cuz I wanna see more
Though this projects already big. I think if you go into the neter at all you should hide little secrets and easter eggs for the players to find. Wether they be in the fortestes or even in the bastions, i think it could be really fun!
I wanna be like you when I grow up
Keep working I will likely pay for this
so happy to see what the next bionms
THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER
I really wish I could have this map
A glacier with casms exposing tunnels carved by meltwater.
𝚌𝚊𝚗 𝚎𝚎 𝚐𝚎𝚝 𝚊 𝚠𝚘𝚝𝚕𝚍 𝚍𝚘𝚠𝚗𝚕𝚘𝚊𝚍 𝚏𝚘𝚛 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚜 𝚝𝚑𝚒𝚗𝚐! 𝙿𝚘𝚐𝚐𝚎𝚛𝚜
Why don’t you do a type of generation using this, like a mod.
Y’all better get this to 80k likes
Only watched first 5 minutes and already love it
Add seceret: wolf den
Oooo you like big bildnings then bild the norwegan Nidarosdomen that was maked by the vikings
Great idea to ad flouting islands in the jungle, they are connected with big lianas and on one of the islands is the jungle temple
Me, who spends a solid hour making a single custom tree:
The island´s kinda sus
After watching this video, i subscribed, turned notifications on, liked the vid and now commenting how amazing ur builds are
I love your vids and every one sub
now you have to transform the nether and the end :)
If I was a villager I would go to the church to worship you everyday
Definitely earned a sub and a like 👍
Pls a lite smaler buildings
Plsss can realese the mapp pls
Nice
im excited
I’m 3 minutes into the video and this looks fucking amazing. Can’t wait to play it!🤩
Not gonna lie this give me huge red dead redemption vibes. Also amazing job!
This is the coolest thing I have ever seen you deserve so much more then 1 mill
HOLY SHIT THIS IS AMAZING
This is Minecraft if they actually upgraded there builds when the community wanted them.
80K likes? What a joke... We are almost halfway in 4 hours! LETS GO GUYS!
you should add a mod that makes all of these structures appear naturally
This is why I’m subbed
Pog
Wait is this good on MCPE and 1.17.50
Looking so very good so far!
A cool idea would be a rift to a hole new dimension somewhere hidden in the map
Dude You are amazing ! Keep Going And i really Wait for the Next biome Your Big Fan From Egypt ❤️❤️
add a floating island as the hub
In 1 of the biomes, you need to add a dedicated spot for players to build their own house. It would help people blend into the upgraded map.
Underrated
You should also make a mini mod pack with this. This should include minor things like a beekeeper profession for villagers and other things.
I can already imagine doing modded survival
Just noticing now that the like to dislike ratio is the legendary 1000 to 1 Well deserved
Is there gonna be a rift?
This is insane and all that for 1 biome cant wait to see all the other biomes.
This guy so undderated you need 83 million subs
*g i v e   m e   t h a t   w o r l d*      *( p l e a s e )*
Wow!!
Hey he created mata nui ( props to who gets that)
0:00 sus
Maybe you could add a large skeleton of a creature in like the desert or something.
bro i wish i can build like that thats cool bro
Hell I want to play this map
That looks great, hoping this comment helps in the algorithm so we see the others
imagine chopping down THOSE trees in survival
Hey 1 more thing when this is done you should put it up as a world download
could you make this project a free download
In the Mesa biome build beachers hope, from Red Dead Redemption
Minecraft should hire you as a builder honestly.
Bro let’s get to run this sweet map Trixy Truly masterful as always!!!
Lit!!!
How do get the world edit feature????
you just do a wizard tower/village on the shroom island
This guy is basically creating a Minecraft version of Westworld
This is great
I cannot wait for the finished map🔥
Amazing!!!
Amazing. You should also build a pair (or One) big city
make a amogus refrense or a tricky the clown refrense or just add my fave pls love your vids
I really want to play this map at the badrock Edition if its possible🙏🙏
You should build a massive palace in the winter biome on top of the largest mountain.
Do you plan on having a version of this with just the biomes without any structures? I'd love to try making my own structures
where to download
BEAUTIFUL
I would love to download this map once it's finished, hope you keep up the amazing work
It feels like something you'd see in a medieval mashup pack's custom world
If you want this map to be survival friendly You need to have ores and stuff underground And you need the stronghold  Maybe you can upgrade the nether and end too 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Not even 4 hours yet and it’s at 34k
You should add a giant crater and meteor and a waterfall going into it
In my opinion, a better order would be: mesa, desert, savannah, jungle, dark forest, taiga, snowy mountains.
I can’t wait for the world download!
You should put this in the Minecraft store for minecoins, so that bedrock players on console can download it
First reaction: SUBBED
That was the  best world I have ever seen you should be part of a Minecraft company and build cities.
amazing as always
I love this guys creativity and patience. So thrilled to see the map come together
make a broken up curch some where and put a jurnal in it explining the merchant and also why the curch is broken up
Congrats on 1 mill!!! looking much forward to this one man :))))
I will play that map with my two brothers and a friend! I’m looking forward to that
0:24, why doesn't your name show up when I search most talented Minecraft builders?
Download pwease?
This is amazing love the builds, are u gonna put some stuff in the empty places on the map? Cuz as u said the map is huge, so wondering if any big build will be going onto the plain areas on the map or is it specifically changing set places on the biomes?
I'm really looking forward to this cant wait for the world download for inspiration!
In the jungel biom make a cavern temple or a retual spot
Im begging please make this playable for multiplayer servers, that would be so fun
spead the word 80 k come on
Plains biome “keeping it normal” In the background the water in the farms turning into ice
Wowww i can't waittt to play this map thats amazingg
This would be really cool with mineshafts and monsters along with the epic fight mod for this map
I dont even want to know the massive number of hours it probably took him to make this video
He Made Mojang's builders team  look like A Joke
This my third comment lol, congrats on 1mil
This is so freakin cool.  I'd suggest to put out winter dragons ❄️
This is madly insane!
Put snoopdog in there somewhere lol
It's very rare that I watch a mc building video and I get inspired. I'm pretty bad at building in minecraft, but holy crap I don't feel like I want to build, I feel like I NEED to build.
Yeah, but why?
Now THIS is sick can’t wait till part 2!!
Add an underground ice cave, as the cave/cliff update wont have them :(  Plus ice spike biome, but upside down and right side up underground would be cool  Also you could use anchient debris as a meat on the firepit for the pillagers
he is so amazing  man im 12
Image a volcano off the coast. I know that's not vanilla but a man can dream
Ice castle in the mountains?
Holy cow. Please Finish this soon
add an improvide zobie spawner  also a better mineshaft
Are you a map developer on the Wynncraft server? If not you should definitely be accepted by their server owner.
Please make a temple in any biome it looks amazing!
This project feels like an rpg game now but better
6:52   "dummies, you dummy"
It’s all soooo cool! You did very good! 🥺😁😂
Pog champ
Hm.
This is so good this guy only has 1. Mil give hime more
This is like the coolest transformation of a world and it is so awesome
Brooooo can we get a download amid just the vanilla map so we can play it without the custom stuff in survival? This would be epic on an smp server
It would be really cool if you would build some huge structures scattered around the map, like a huge cathedral or a huge pyramid :)
Dang this is fire
imagine Mojang watches this video...
I will pay to get this map I'm so excited for the next video
This is looking AMAZING man u r the best, I really think you should add small towns with a blacksmith and stable and add a main court where all the villagers from different biomes come to settle debates.
Wow, it looks amazing already!!
My god this is amazing !!
Ooo a cool idea, under the jungle biome if you could maybe put a cave entrance leading down to a bigger cave with a waterfall in it that would be awesome and behind the waterfall there would be some sort of secret.
Hey Trixyblox!!! You should make a evil Lair underneath the dessert somewhere.
This is amazing 😍 love from 🇮🇳
Make a wisard tower un one of the mountains and a water fall with a cave in the back
will this be available for bedrock too, it also looks super cool too
@trixyblox you are an amazing person I love you and you are insanely good at building I really enjoyed and that looks like it took forever to build
If/when you are done, im definitely going to play it!!!
ha ha Mr. anyhow your cooping technoblade=]
what about the nether?!
The map is kinda reminding me of the horizon map not the car game one
How long does this usually take?
Ima send this vid to some friends so you can get 80K likes! :))
So basically red dead but Minecraft
Maybe add a tavern in the plains biome
My pc: you better delete this or we are gonna have ourselves a happy little accident
KEEP LIKING WE NEED THIS AT 80k
What program did you use to place those clusters of trees?
the dislikes are people that dont have java edition or play roblox
Plains needs the flower biome !!
Oh god i hope there will be a tremors reference in the desert biome
This looks like a Rust map
Is there gonna be a stronghold tho, that would be cool
I think Forge Labs will love this and use it for his 100 day challenges
why doe’s his eyes look deep faked
I love that the georgous cathedral is for him only tiny church
I would like to see a coral reef literally anywhere but it would be neat if it was around the mushroom island
Say hi, the thumbnail said it
Star Wars EWOKS in the jungle or at least a reference to them?
you can add dungeons and chest with loot!
Bootifull
you should do a mod pack with the villages and structures and i will be the first one to get it cos its fire
You should put a castle related to each biome to be the leaders of each biome with specific enemies in each. For example, a pyramid castle in the desert and a castle made with the same blocks as woodland mansions in the dark oak forest.
Omg this is absolutely unreal this is amazing!! I can’t wait to see the finished project!
You should do the nether for 2 million
This is absolutely incredible!!! Keep up the hard and good work!!
its a giant Crosaint!!
hello Trixy,  since this is going to be some kind of survival map, it would be pretty lame if you get into the nether/end and it's just venilla minecraft. it might be cooler if you were going to upgrade that too.
Im excited to see where this goes.
Enhanced zombies mod ?
This makes me qustion your sanity.   I won't miss the next episodes, this is amazing!!!
The winter should definitely include Nordic mythology
9:48 egg
Can you make this into a multi player server
sheeeeeeeeee-
first vid ive seen by you and it deserves a sub
I think you should do an Easter egg pertaining to the fact that the world is not real and is artificially generated. Maybe a series of secret control rooms hidden below the map that are pulling the strings of the overworld? I think it'd be a cool mystery
Lowkey looks like the uchiha symbol
IDEAS 😛  A secret underground biome? 😮 A broken nether portal that actually leads to a remade nether biome? 🤯 A Small swamp biome with a remade witch hut? 🤔 A remade stronghold under de center of the map? 👀 A plane crash/survivor spot in the jungle? 🤠 An ice castle to go with the snow village? 🥶 A volcano in the desert? 🔥 Birch forest? 🤣  What do you guys think of those? 😊
Maybe the best thing i've seen in my life?
It looks awesome... cant wait to play on it with few mods
This looks incredible! Can’t wait to see what you build next 😄
DND 😆😆
SO good! btw first time watching u :D
Can you plz make the the next one of these fast plz
Wow man Congratulations on 1M! i've been watching your epic builds for like 3/4 years now. Wow
Next project idea, doo the Skyrim map or parts of it BC it is quite big
Wow
"4000 x 4000 = 16000"  ... to dim to use a calculator
Grian must be proud👌
Meanwhile: *I give up after building a Dirt Hut.*
this is pure fire amazing skills self desings no copies from other creators and this is skills
I'm so excited to play on this finished world with my friends! Great job! Looks amazing!
Make an abandoned  Shroom Castle
the music when showing off the finished project made me sad. I miss you Charmo
It would be cool if you made a hidden monster cave somewhere which had a dragon or any other big monster you think would fit the theme
KEEP BUILDING THIS LOOKS SO GOOD!
sugestion: do the same in the nether:)
TRIXY IS BACK!!!
Oh I’m really excited for the next video
Add a mayan temple in the jungle
Would be cool if you added the woodland mansion
Beautiful AMAZING good job
it would be amazing if he transforms the nether biomes aswell
Truly one for they books.
Thought this was a in game Catan game lol.
This is the first video I have watched, and this guy’s editing is so good
Make a Mosque for the desert biome instead of a church
Hey when it's done can I download it in mobile?
For the ice village do first nation/Canadian natives village builds
Just gonna like. It doesn’t hurt and I just wanna See were this leads. Good job so far Trixy!
You should add a cloud/sky area too!
My dream Minecraft series. THANK YOU 🙏🙏🙏
Could you add also the end portal? Pls
GET THIS MAN SOME LIKES
Love Wild West ideas
Maybe you can add stables and shrines like in breath of the wild
Man love this vid
When I download this I'm making a video no doubt
Skeletons of forgotten/deleted/removed mobs in the desert
How did he copy and paste the trees like that?
That is very cool
Can u also do a nether hub to get around to sections of the map?
I love these videos and this has the be the one I'm the most excited to see out of every single one. (I wanna download the maps but I don't have a good enough computer to run normal Minecraft without lagging)
OMFG THIS SOUNDS SO GOOD I AM SO DOWNLOADING THIS!!!!!!!
Concept: A cave in the highest mountain in the snowy mountains that houses the creature in the snowy mountains.
I subscribed after watching the video
You should add some mods with this map
Make a big icey skeleton with horns and its head, left arm, and bits of ribcage sticking out
is this free or do you have to pay for it
I would make a wall around the village and people please like this map is amazing and I want to play on it for myself
This is going to be the best map ever!!! I can't wait to play it!
Incroyable je veux cette map une fois terminée !!
This is amazing!!
*oh cool, he made australia*
This looks so amazing! I can't wait to see what else u build
Ice caves with mammoth remains
This is insane! You deserve way more subs
ADD SOME SEWERS UNDER THE HUGE MOUNTAINE
Please release this
was the island's structure based on Wano?
make the cleric's caravan more strange looking to make it actually look like it sells strange items.
okay trixy has lost his damn mind
Tundra or mountains definitely need a viking village and some draugr infested cementary💪
This might be one of the best builds, like sheeeeeeeesh
Philosophy behind this video: "I got tired of just transforming one thing at a time so I just decided to do the rest of it in one giant mega-series"
please please please finish it!!! I would love to play survival on this with my friends
Epik
Bro this is the real deal. If there is one job you will get it will be a biome a designer for biome and buildings.
This needs to be turned into some kind of mc rpg
You can do mansion, ice spikes, drowned ruins like atlantis those are my ideas
Just love what your doing one question will it be available for bedrock and java?
I hope soo bad you’ll add a Swamp biome to your plan, I really like the idea of a village standing on pillars above the water like they did in one of the villages in Avatar. Also like to see in the forests some broken trees and part of trees laying on the ground as decoration. Already looks good and hope too see more of this!
A giant forest would so great ! With sequoia
Hey man, great work on that island, you should try downloading the "Nef's medieval decorations mod" and taking a look at all the cool structures that generate naturally
Keep liking for everyone who wants the map
build yourself and girl a secret house....
I've thought about this idea for ages and it's so cool to see you do it! I'm so hyped!
What about creat a mod pack to do a rpg
That was awesome can't wait until the map release
16,000 is about 128 by 128  4,000 x 4,000 is 16,000,000
Mojang:*planing to upgrade the world generation one day* Trixy:i am four paranal universes ahead of you.
I hope those srtuctures will be used in some vanilla enhancing mods, like Yung's or Abnormals.
My idea is for the snowy mountains, scatter around a bunch of mountains with the biggest in the middle
This guy is a god, I can't believe he isn't more popular than he is. Trixy is literally the best Minecraft builder I have ever seen!
you could leave a chest in the portal, that says: abandon all hope whoever enters here.
Question, do I need to be a patron to download his worlds or is it free?
@Trixyblox I would love to see what comes next. Make secret shack in the mountains and a nice Shrek swamp randomly between two biomes pls. I would love to see my idea added lol
Gonna be honest, I'll probably be most excited for the Mesa, it's so underused and now it can so cool, hell might find some mods to go with this map so I can have the wild west stuff good, some more jungle stuff and other things
Pog!!!!
And trixy Block saw that was a good thing, third day
Did he add a woodland mansion
This is amazing
This guy is absolutely amazing!!!
please make this public
This is sooo awesome :0
ok but now make 3,000,000 of these so there can be seeds.
When you finish this whole project you do the same thing but to the Nether on the same World
Acc best mc video
Just a story idea... What if like you had all the different biomes in somwhat of a war and maybe some alliances
I really hope i will be able to download the map in the future, it looks awesome and would be pretty fun use it with friends
Minecraft is like: Yay punching trees to get wood! Meanwhile:
Can't wait for the world download!
This was really cool,  And, you’re going to call me blind for this, but when he first zoomed out to look at the entire map... I thought it looked small.
Make it available on bedrock when it’s done
Get some youtubers to play this on camera! It would be fun to watch!
Incredible!
You should add a singular Eye Of Ender in each biome, and a large expedition to get it.  In the center plains biome, the underground has a stronghold temple that can only be activated with all of the eyes. So you can still beat the game, and make it take a long while trying to scavenge around for resources.
your map is the best i've ever seen
I hope we don't need to buy this map
Here's attempted I think that you probably already know the bells are not actually useless they actually conquer great the villagers and and a virgin I don't know remember don't make all the pillagers glow
Mice
I love this i want more
This is what I aspire to build. It's incredible
I think it would be rlly cool to have some huge ice caves in the snowy mountains biome with some monster in them or something like that. Could also add for some good lore too.
I need more episodes now.
like the video
Just started the video, I can’t wait to see what he does
Can we get some breaking bad references in the build?
Man you need to upload more frequently!
You make Minecraft look like a completely new game, gorgeous
Amazing pls do more
Make a snowman family living in the snowy mountians
Trixyblox that map is gotta to be my favorite out of all i've seen it has all i want in a minecraft world,when can i download it.
Hello 👋
This would be a great winn craft style server  Also have you played age of calamity?
You should make morioh cho somewhere
Bro do yu have a life this is just. Just. ..                Very crazi
Yes yes yes this is soon cool
I WANNA PLAY THIS 😭😭
I think it would be cool to have caves and naturally spawning ores
Make a hidden herobrine spawner
Amazing
Ice cave
I think a graveyard would fit the church.
"We didn't expect yellow people to die!" - Grian, the keeper of pufferfish.
This looks f**King fantastic  Can wait to see the Bob Ross reference Stupid question  this be playable on Xbox?
I love your style of building! You have such talent with these things, it's so awesome to see all this. Thank you and I cant wait for more!
You should build stuff from game of thrones for a video! That would be insane
Just wow
11:32 Duke-? 😂
Make a castle in the snowy hills. It would look AWESOME 😃
Jeff bezos funded this village.
Me seeing that pillager tower gave me a hard one fucking master piece i must say
Since you have taken some inspiration from BoTW, I have a possible new mega build for you. My idea is to recreate the entire map in Minecraft, including villages, mountains and possibly even the divine beasts. I don't know if you will do this, or even see my comment, but I personally think it would be pretty cool to make. Anyway, this was a beautiful and inspirational build as usual, and I hope you keep up the quality content!
Wow. That looks cool. Can you make one with out the story aspect but if not its fine such a great job well done on 1 mill thanks
Wait. Isn’t 4000x4000 =16000000?
This was truly amazing!!! If I were to make a suggestion, I would say you should add weirwood trees in the spruce biome, when you get to it
I would instead use the cart for wandering traders, they are a better fit for a collector and merchant for magical items (they sell glow stone in game)
No mansion?
dayumm
For the shipwreck you should make a small pirate village featuring a skull shaped cave with treasure in it!!! The mouth of the skull would be at ground/sea level and you could have stairs winding down the skull into a cave of treasure and dead or undead pirates!! It'd be so cool!!! Love your content keep it up!!!! I'm super excited for the rest of this build!!!!
I absolutely love the energy all of your videos have. The buildings look absolutely insane, and I just can't wait for updates on the map. Congrats on 1 MIL!!!
Are you planning to do the other two dimensions at any point? I feel like that could be another really cool part of the project. Regardlesss, great job overall! This is really cool
Love this
Underground city
Add a great tree that has a whole village in it
yoo this crazy!!
Please add some some caves all around the map with hidden secrets inside
The 33 dislikes are people who tripped while pressing the like button
Secret magic tower with Those pillagers that use magic (As a version of the woodland mansion?)
Fun fact!: if you add fun fact at the start of your comment people will read it like if it works for you
I have an idea, a city under the sea
bro world link??
This is absolutely incredible
A Shattered Savanna would be dope!
I'm getting goosebumps,I really can't wait for this 😁😄
can you try to build an ark survival evolved map in minecraft??? the isle, ragnarok or whatever.
The map looks like Wano
I want this world just to see all the little nooks and crannies
i would like to see each strucher remake on youtube you can make a vide for ever biome  sory i can't spell
Who could dislike this, haters man, some odd ppl
can you make a viking village
Trixy, brush your teeth!
I have never seen you before .......       BUT IM ALREADY SUBSCRIBING Keep it up bro 😎😍👍🏾
You should make a secret place were there is a moon religion since that is the islands shape
stop making everything to OP but still pretty epic!!!
It would be great if you could put this up for free... It would help with publicity and people would love to play it!
i would love you to add coral reefs outside the island and i imagine how sick it would be for the jungle biome to have a gigantic tree
Hmm mayby a broken bridge To the mush room Island?
This is the Minecraft I want to play
hhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
This guy could literally snatch the jobs of Mojang Developers 😆
He should make a gigantic cave as like a resemblance for where the yeti lives
300 2
Awsome
8000 likes eh we at 24k in three hours
this man build a whole survival world and i am still building my wooden box
i want to use this for a hardcore world  also please add an end portal
Dude... legendary I can't wait for the next upgrade
I enjoyed every secound of this Video ,thanks
incredible idea!
13:06 wait look at that roof, it looks like a pillager outpost roof right? and listen, you can here the raid horn. I think that this is a hint at the lore, I seriously feel like matpat right now.
The mines need a giant crystallized Cave after you have completed a challenge in the mines
I love your videos
Woooow Trix amazing idea and building keep up the good work 💪🏼🤯
I aspire to be able to build like this man
lowkey want to see a mosque as an alternative place of worships hmm hmm
THAT VILLAGE LOOKS FUN TO BURN AND BLOW UP IF U KNOW U KNOW
This would have been an awesome hour long video with all the biomes can't wait for the rest
Idea: for the mushroom bio you could do a little mushroom house with a mushroom farm
super excited to see the transformation of the other biomes!! and congrats for the 1mil, you deserve it
you could add a road that goes to all of the main villages and landmarks, with perhaps the occasional roadside feature along the way, such as Inns, taverns, encampments, mines, etc.  I think this would both make the world feel more lived in and connected, and it would help guide the player through the world, and may even serve a function, as them travelling could mean that they will require a place to sleep during the night.
for mesa or savanna u could take inspiration from red dead redemption that would be awsome
Less go
Well, the limits just increased
Will it have caves and chests in the structures, i want to host realms on this map when its done but also want it to be a fully playable map
This is so vanilla looking yet SO MUCH BETTER !!!
damn its amazing
This is amazing
everybody gangsta till he start to make the nether and the end
OH. MY. GOD.
I am totaly dawnlowding this world to make a server with my friends! That's awesome! I wonder how it would work and look with mods
This is absolutely amazing! Can't wait to see the rest of the transformations! Keep up the good work and even better content!
I want my second video. RIGHT NOW! Hahahahha
Where do I download that world?
Map link please !! It's awesome
Mojang should hire this guy
Can i play on this world?
Will you do the nether too?
Something I'd find cool is scattered ruins with varying wear!  Not every ruin is a temple or a crypt, and I'd love to see more types of ruin's as well as different states of decay!
yooo
Youtubers always say, "get this video to X amount of likes for part 2" Like everyone knows you're already going to make a part 2 because you want views.  Edit: this isn't about you specifically, I just got triggered when I heard you say it.
Can we have a download of the blank map?
Mojang should hire you
how do you have the patience ???
Me who wants this world but I’m bedrock user .-.
Get dream to do manhunt here
work on the nether as well. Cant wait to see the final build
HELLOOOOOO I LOVE YOOO VIDDDS
when he was building the farmers house and added a little cottage for the beekeeper immediately sent my ADHD brain into a cute gay cottage core story line spiral
You should make a corals reef:) Also you are great, you should make a colab with jeracraft
They should put this as the new tutorial map on console 😝
i cant wait for the next biome transformation!!!!! epic video
Host this on a server.
mojang hire this man already
Wow, you are amazing at building bases in minecraft! very excited to get this world!
Maybe a natural generator trading hall in jugle would be Nice so i can lure villagers in it and get easy trades
For the mountains biome, you should do something like the Snowpeak Ruins from Zelda Twilight Princess. I think that’d be super cool.
Man, Trixy is so talented as a builder, cannot wait for more.
80000 likes people!
This is amazing
#idea   I know someone will use the map for an adventure map or an RPG themed server.   *i can feel it*   And yes, i wish to make an adventure map out of it.
Maybe in the plot you have in mind you could make it so there is a story in which the final is an end portal, which takes you to an alien civilisation and the end dragon fight takes place in an arena . Idk If its to hard but then if you beat the end dragon you could refight but then against the wither . Just like a real arena against real different type of enemies.
Imagine hoe much dedication and patience is needed for this build. This guy is a legend.
Wadzee: Creative? Pathetic.
can you putit on bedrock on the marketplace i buyit
Try to add little things other than the specific villiage ! Like maybe a little campsite here and there some broken down wagons a little outpost for travelers and such! If the worlds massive there will be plenty of space. I love it
get this man to 80000 likes
A Herobrine shrine would be a nice secret
Is this world open for bedrock??
oh god im 3 hours late
aaah, buddy - you forgot to include work stations for the villagers in the Trading Square to renew their trades. Right now, they'll run out of stuff and never restock their trades.
You should make some ruins on the other side of the nether portal
This is unbelievably cool, so excited to watch this whole thing play out!
A BIG ASS FOSSIL IN THE PLANES/OCEON
what about a mythical grove in the dark oak forest? like a little fairy village or something like that, can't wait to check that world out, def gonna stream it
Is their any way i can just download the island and vanilla structures plus the tresure hunt and if it would be possibe with your very very cool trees?? :) cause it would be fun to play harcore on it
Ooo fun
Sheeeesh! This is amazing 🔥
This is fucking awesome dude!
just pay this guy Mojang.
You should try to make a Star Wars World (like if you were to create a planet for a future Star Wars film, what would it look like)?
I got really excited, and checked the upload time/date hoping it was an old video and that you already had a ton of these videos done 😅 cried when that was not the case. (Pregnancy hormones can really get ya sometimes)
Trixy: Only some minor changes to the librarian.  Also Trixy: Rebuilds the entire house  Me for minor changes: Adds 2 trapdoors to a house “Perfect”
GUYS LIKE IT NOW
I can’t lie I want him to make erebor or something like it in the snowy mountains or Mirkwood In the dark oak
Your awesome
when are minecraft going to use these amazing buildings and the diffrent Biomes
I love trixyblocks
Please make this world available for everyone!
Honestly Mojang need to hire this man I always thought that the structures in Minecraft we're just too boring that I found this person
you should make a giant underground mine with dungeons and stuff and an amazing custom stronghold! love your builds
Wow.
Underground tunnels connecting all of the biomes would be cool
This was absolutely insane, can't wait to see what is coming in the future
Will you play on this map in survival but other than that amazing video!
I thouth about you could make an mini tree city on the side Wall of a moutain so it would be like hanging down from the moutian. And make it like cool and cozy  I thouth about it could a a birthday gift idk bc i have birth day today. But Yea  Just an idea i thouth could be cool  Have a good day and a Nice Life people  Keep the happy toune in the chat!!
In the sea, some ships could be fighting or be shipwrecked. Like The Jackdaw and Queen Anne's Revenge from Assassin's Creed Black Flag, or even the Black Pearl from Pirates of Caribbean.
You probably get this alot but do u realize how INSPIRING ur videos r? :-D u know that feeling wen ur done watching a Bruce Lee movie, u feel like u can do Kung Fu once the movie ends? Yeah i get that with ur vids EVERYTIME! I immediately open up my Minecraft world and start building for HOURS nonestop :-D i doubt im the only one who feels like this tho, so i just wana say, Trixy, THANK YOU for ur AMAZING and INSPIRING videos o7 LOOOOOOOOOVE THEM!!! Edit: Also, is there any chance of me being ur right hand man in this HUGE project and assist u with building this insane world??? im not bad at building and designing structures, ive been doing art for over 20 years now :) for example, i made a carnival biome, with rides and stuff with pressure plates all over the ground so that wen the villagers walk over them fireworks shoot into the sky with various colours and patterns... looks pretty cool as us walking up to the Carnival :)
Where is the swamp
I guess the plains aren't that plain any more
Some ideas: A pirate ship A haunted mansion A witch hut A sea serpent A giant squid A flying monster
Dude that looks awesome! I think i have a good suggestion you should build something close to bleak falls barrow form skyrim in the mountains area that would look so cool!
O my gosh he is good
Will you make a download link when you finish trixy
This should be an ark map
yall better get this to 80K
Make a giant mushroom thats also a house in the middle of the mushroom island
For mooshroom island make a statue of the “mooshroom monstrosity” from minecraft dungeons
This guy builded Erebor so he deserves my eternal subscription.
*it gives me pain seeing him manually building and copy+pasting trees, boulders, and bushes into the map with worldedit instead of just attaching the schematic files for them to a brush in worldedit*
WE. NEED. A. DOWNLOAD. LINKKKKK.
KRAKEN, PLEASE
claim your "here before viral" ticket here >
I am so hyped for the download
make diamonds spawn at Y 15 without anyone knowing it:)
Please put Shreks swamp im begging you
If it was my world I would want dragons in the mountains but that's not normal dragons. Maybe dwarves at war with the dragons? Eh. No acata for the savanna?
This reminds me of the arena from the second Hunger Games story
Damn
This looks like zelda and genshin impact but if you add hundreds of stressful quests, hard commissions and a ton of hostile mobs it will resemble genshin 1000%
Can't express how excited I am!
am i the only one who will like each biome to be as big as his whole map? like  the bigger the better
Can you please make two towers from lord of the rings
Stonehenge !!!
I'm a bit confused do you mean it's 16.000 blocks wide or high or that's is 4.000 blocks high and wide cause if it's 4.000 x 4.000 that's 16.000.000... 16 million.... and if it's 16.000 x 16000 then what's the 4.000 x 4.000 for if it's de length of the line under why is it 4.000 x 4.000?? that would be for squares right?
u look like baby
Lets gooo 2 hours from upload and already 20k likes! Keep it up guys this will be eeeaasyyyy
Yes, but is there a download anywhere?
Please also do the flower forest
Custom caves would be dope Also DAMN I bet even Keralis and Grian envy how good you are at building
Cant wait for someone to speedrun his map
Play this map with some mods and you got hytale
and now its time to add hypixel skyblock items to this (im KIDDING lol). I can't wait to see the final product though! :)
If you need one idea: For the Mushroom Island, make a giant underground Mushroom Village, that is only accessible from one of the bigger mushroom. Another idea is there can be a run down castle in the dark oak biome, infested with monsters and dead villagers of the kingdom.
#free_palestine_🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
8:00 He sounds like he's in a property show
Make a viking-style village in tundra!
What Shader do you use? Love your vids
Wait, You're not related to David Dobrik
Looks great already. Cant wait to see what else is thrown in!
Breath of the wild minecraft pog?
U could add jungle warriors and mystical beasts
yes
Note: Don't take down the custom trees.
In the mountains put like an Inca empire type architecture to make it look like people used to live there.
Can you pls make the map for bedrock two
This is sick
This is massively well done! Fantastic concept and awesome results. Very nice!!
Please make a server using this map imagine like there are different factions for each of the biomes
I really can’t wait  to see the rest of the world! I plan on playing in it keep it up!
So cool
people who disliked (iM a clOWn)
I feel like the scale of this is mimicking the map in Shadow of the Colossus
Awesome build dude! Just gotta say, if you want the windmill to be accurate, you just need to flip the blades to the otherside of the main log. Apart from that, its really accurate! You even placed it high up and kept the trees around it low
Well you got my like  Also. Are you going to customize the nether
u need to open ur own damn server  and add ice and fire to this map and it will look amazing
Yooo this is awesome!!
bro this man is god
With all those secrets and deatails you have planned it would look like red dead 2
Idea: out trails for the merchants to fallow and put random merchant wagons on them  Oops almost forgot to say to connect the paths to the village
I love your videos because of two main reasons. 1. They are really high quality in terms of skill, presentation etc.  2. They are made in a way so that I can watch them without getting sick. I can't handle first person games at all. I get motion sickness from it. But you always record it with a free floating camera which means I can enjoy these videos too. Thank you!
When the thumbnail is sus
Ican't wait to download this. I thought it might as well bwcome a mod too. It allows pwople who can't watch your videos and increases your popularity so yoy can share your content with more people
Right now I am learning modding, and while ago, I got an idea. Wouldnt it be cool to have world generation mod that makes world generate with trixyblocks biomes and structures?
I wish vanila was like this.
this has to be one of the most visually satisfying videos i have watched and i can't wait to see more you are by far my favourite MC builder well done Trix and congrats on the 1 million
This is INCREDIBLE! Just an Idea: Since you are building this you should add a TrixyBlox monument somwhere. That would be so cool! Keep up the good work! ❤
Mojang needs to hire this man
Can’t wait for the next biome!
Nether biomes 😳 (or not this is a massive build after all and you shouldn’t overwork yourself)
We need a massive survival games competition on this map
Couri is definitely gonna make a video speedrunning this world lol
You should add a dragon skeleton in one of the biomes
Trixy, Jeracraft, Grian, and GoodtimeswithScar should do a collab video.
Make a snow cabinet on the snow Mountain
This is truly awesome
Bedrock download???
for the mooshroom island you should make custom mushrooms and turn them into little houses
this is really cool and I would love to see this for my self!! also a suggestion is in the jungle you could add a small Jurassic park Easter egg? maybe like a raptor cage or even a visitors center? both rundown of course!
I NEED MORE
Wow
it looks AMAZING
I wish I had that map/world.
WOOOOOOW
I don’t even know if I could build a farm like that. You have some seriously impressive talent!!
You should upgrade the nether and the other realms
You should add something related to the Wandering Trader somewhere
This is amazing
2:46. You should make a hidden cavern that is like an underground pirate cove
and by that i mean
WOW
just like
WOW
Hope this gets ported to Bedrock.
I really do hope you'll do something for the Nether as well!
Please make a old ruin (maybe next to a volcano). Or a mid age bagage car driven by a Horse
i really love this! this is so beautiful and i love how you did some things with botw! :D
Do the nether as well white all the biomes!  like so trixy can see thise
but did he keep the chest in the ruined portal
Make a dungeon and a strong hold
Put in netherite so we dont need to go in nether olso if you can make the end in to  a moon.
Suggestion about mountain biome, have you ever seen Jumanji: Next Level. There is a fortress owned by Jurgen the brutal that I think the look would be perfect for that biome!?
Hey trixy, I play on bedrock and I wanted to know if the map was gonna be there as well as in java? I love your builds and your one of my favorite creators, so i'd really like to download it there.
maybe a cool underground dungeon in the jungle?
where can i download it?
Imagine if Whitelight's Villager Overhaul Mod was used in this...
When the thumbnail is sus
Maybe you could do the woodland mansion
Now all we need is 100 kids and air drop them in
I rly want this to become a mod with a story for each biome with bosses new mobs and overall this to become a nice rpg
Ok it's confirmed now: Trixyblox is absolutely crazy
You should put the underwater city build in the water as an upgraded coral biome
I think that a good idea is that every biome has one main structure, for example in the desert the piramid, in the forest the azteca temple, etc. Every structure has challenges inside that the player has to beat to get an ender eye (or something like that). The player would have to go to  every structure and beat the challenges to collect those ender eyes. When you have them all, you can go to the End.
What about mining like or randomly spawn
This is very cool.... but u should have added a swamp biome too
Have ever done a space them before?
a) I WANT MORE!!!!!! :) b) will you give the villagers actual professions to trade in survival
How many builds and projects do you want at the same time?  Trixy: Yes.
You could do a treasure hunt
Secret underground vault
NICE*
Add an abandoned castle kinda like where the necromancer was at during the hobbit
I wanna see this so fricking bad
This is soooooooooo cool!
Keep up the great work!!! Love it. Looking forward to a stronghold 😃
Reply at 80k
Dude you  should make a data pack
I’m getting mass amount of Skyrim vibes from these builds
This is so cool! Does anyone know if caves exist on this map?
It reminds me of wyncraft
I think you should show how all the the villages are connected for example have some kind of central city where all roads lead to
I might do a survival game w/ my friends with this
Can you do desert next
not gonna lie this is amazing
i wouldnt want to ruin your hard work by playing it on survival lol, those custom trees are beautiful!
Would love to see a underground village/civilization in the snowy mountains
You should also make a forgotten battle feild
You make vanilla Minecraft look like it was made by 5 year olds 😂
How do you danload it
really hope he does a makeover of the mineshaft
Nice
I play on bedrock edition i can't play it:(
That's so good I would like to try to survive in this world 😜
This is awesome!!!!
Why not add a floating island? Or maybe even several. But bruh, this I awesome
You make a massive mysterious tower in the center
Do the savanna biom next
Nice video pls make more from this projekt
I think something cool for the ice vilage whould be a viking vilage, with a main hall where everyone gather to celebrate, feast and have meatings, and posebly a statue of a nordic god of your choise
This should be the new mincraft ultimate map
Cannot wait for your Mesa build, a railroad?! I love trains and am looking forward to see what you make!
Have an abandoned villager lab
This is very good
This is probably not something that will get added but, it would be cool if there could be quests or things like that to do. Maybe find a good trustable person to maybe do some command block magic. Quests wouldn't give to much, just some smaller extras to help along the way.
When Trixy doesn't know what to do with a build..... "I'll add a tower, that'll do it"
How about a different planet for the next map like Jupiter
I am very excited for this
I'm excited for the western area
Yoooo! I’m really good at building highways really slowly. Can I do some?
This man is pure insparation...and i also think he has a LOT of free time😂
You should make this a survival server
I NEED MORRRRRRE
Nice build! Can’t wait for the next one! Congratulations on the 1 million subs btw!
Instead of making it a survival world, maybe you can make it a open world adventure map, with the use of command blocks and such so that instead of the normal adventure maps where you are forced to just do the story. The player has a choice to roam around for a while but the story will progress with a command block trigger of somewhat
Bedrock players be like:           👀  👄
Are you going to upgrade the nether and the end too ?
Pleeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaase, make this world available for Bedrock. I would buy it!!!!!! Pleeeeeease!!!!! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I think it would be a cool idea to make the different villages have different places of worship instead of them all having a church
Maybe a giant labyrinth with a loot and a boss you have to avoid/defeat.
When I get the chance ue next big project u should build the breath of the wild hyrule
Its the first time i see your channel and seeing how creative you're just gets me hyped to see what plans you have for the other biomes on this map
YouTube Algorithm says you should look trixi. And dude I binch watch your stuff since two days. It is so satisfying to watch and listen your explanation. Really really awesome
This is insane project. Mad respect.
I can’t wait to be able to download the finished thing
Since the plains village has quite a lot of spruce, they should be friends with the village in the taiga biome and have like a trading path connecting the 2
If I may impose some of my dumb ass ideas:    as a pagan i think it'd be super rad if there was a heathen/pagan place of worship or something in the dark oak forest. I think a fae circle or a offering altar would be super nice. Also a magical lake or smth.  (I think my mind is completely going greek mythology rn, I'm sorry) but yeah, I think that'd be rad
...will we get a witch hut? I would love  to see one in a future video
I would like to see what you could do with cities skylines.
Can not wait for mesa!
Him- "Creates an entire map with new creations and custom builds" Me- "Struggles to create even a single house"
I’m going to TRY copying this into my world
Does anyone relise how much free time this man has?
wow. this is amazing

Add some roads leading from town to town and to different sites around the map
*Ngl the beginning layout drawing looked like the Paradise PD badge*
BRU I wanna play this world so bad
Dont forget the Birch trees!!!
I LOVE IT
amazing
Legends say hes gonna do a nether version of the map
you should  make an underground futuristic city
Could you include a dwarf fortress in the mountains?
Subbed and liked. I probably can't get this on my switch huh? Would it be on the marketplace??
The cleric became an actually useful wandering trader.
playing this with the atlas minimap mod was would be Incredible
Will you add more for having a Nether parallel to this world? From what I understand, so much distance travelled in the overworld equals so much distance travelled in the Nether. Maybe you could have regions where sorcerers experimented in ways they shouldn't have, mutating little sections of the land with corresponding nether aspects, and vice versa with the corresponding nether, putting leaks of this world into the nether but twisted by the nether it has leaked into.;)   Perhaps having a giant base as well crafted as a consortium for this dark cult of Illagers that combined what they've studied into one massive mutated fortress.  And this would allow the creation of bases of both the Illagers and the Villagers that seek to protect the peace they seek from the evil cult.  I'm guessing that you don't intend to make mob mods, but maybe you could also have both good and evil deities crafted as statues of different types representing aspects of the world, with the evil cult having their own.  Maybe for the evil cult having statues based on the minecraft story mode's Wither Storm, maybe a more decked out Herobrine statue, an enderdragon statue, and more.  Statue ideas for Cult: 1. Wither Storm, with it broken up, with potentially tiny web like connections between its segments from its final days, but each growing on its own as the smaller parts orbit the larger central part. Likely, since it'd be larger, hints of wither bones sticking out to make it look even more bad ass. 2. Herobrine, but with armor based on the default outfit with perhaps using web or other things to represent a natural mist of power that comes from his empowered body. Perhaps wielding an upgraded diamond sword inlined with white to represent the mist power flowing into and through the metal with mist the color of his white eyes coming from his palm. 3. Blaze King, custom mob design statue of a king of the blazes, with a large central sun and floating tower rods that are held together by tendrils of smoke. 4. Magma Slime King, spread about like a blob with smaller faces spread about its form. 5. Grand Ghast, a larger ghostial form with multiple faces and tendrils, with see-through ghost faces floating from beneath its form, its eyes and mouth smoking with fire. Inspired by the mutant ghast in Minecraft Story Mode. 6. Ancient Guardian, a guardian so ancient that its paling skin has started to decay into a purple state, with more spikes to emit electricity, eye bloodshot with symbols to grant greater foresight for extending its reach with its electricity, with more fins grown for greater speed. 7. Ender Dragon, just larger and more realistic statue of it. 8. Shulker Knight, a knight formed from multiple shulkers becoming a hive mind, fusing and re-forging their shells into a form that not only allows it to strike with its armor, but also conjure multiple orbs that defy gravity to those hit like orbital weapons. 9. Phantom Overlord, a giant ancient phantom with enough power over dreams that its own body has become distorted from the multi-colored mirages floating off its form. 10. Zombie Emperor, a giant armored zombie with necromantic energies floating through and out of veins, with colors not only representing the expected normal zombies, but even the alternate versions like the Drowned, Husk, Stray, and Vex. 11. A glowing mushroom monster based on the ones that turned stone golems into the Wardens that were announced that seek out foes by sound.  Statue ideas for Villagers: 1. Iron King, a giant golem king of the iron golems, armed with gauntlets with sigils, with runes across the form in a way that resembles a royal garb. 2. Snow King, with an upper body that's more muscled, having large trees as arms with frost floating around them, with a vortex of ice beneath for traversing the ground without legs. 3. Strider Savant, a wiser multi-legged strider with the webs on it now formed like a cowl around its body like royalty. 4. Shroomlord, a giant mushroom monster that used its powers to enhance cows to grant better food for the people. 5. Command Constituent, a giant being made of command blocks, or rather made to look like such, its body made of floating fragments with glowing orbs in the center as its true energy body, or at least a statue with crystals made to resemble such a form beneath the shell that is command blocks that float around its power.  All while having Piglins and possibly Pillagers being neutral factions spread about both the normal and the nether locations with smaller bases of their own.   These are just ideas though. You make what you feel inspired to craft.^^
Aside from the genius design I cant even process how exactly he does what he does. Relocating a structure he built in a splitsecond? How? Nothing makes sense, night is day!
Underground pirate caves?? Or maybe A massive sewer system with A mysterious monster??🐍🐊🐉
😍😍😍😍😍
I hope we can download this because this is pure ART.🤞🤞
It would be cool if you sprinkled in some hatches and secret labs around the world like the whole world is being monitored and studied by a shifty hidden organization
It would be cool to see an Ice Castle in the snow biome .3.
Brilliant work!
They need to increase the hight limit, it's actually preventing even better builds.
having some themed dungneons would add great depth to the playtime of this map! one problem i have with survival maps is that, while they might be pretty, i want something new to do.
Incredible!
So excited for the world download. Could you do one for bedrock please?
maybe put a mosque/synagogue in the desert, a wooden church in the mesa, a buddhist monastery in the mountains, and a hindu temple in the jungle?
This is how Minecraft should be 💯💯💯
You deserve more likes, subs and recognition. If my understanding is correct, basically you're gonna make each biome has their own story which players have to discover by themselves. Dude this is ultimately very awesome
Trixy I just got to say, Your the best Minecraft builder I've ever seen!
This is so much effort
I really want to see how you do the sand temple since last time you made look really cool
is there a download for this??
You should add a cave in the snow mountains biome for something like a monster as like a fun little Easter egg.
Big fortified castle set in the top of a valley in the snowy mountains maybe? Idk have a great day! :)
Please say you populated the underground with ores.  It makes surviving a lot easier and is generally a good idea.
Hi please add [READACTED] i will reall appercate it
Is everyone that watched the video liked we would be there aldreat
For the stonemason’s house and quarry, you should put it on the outer edge if the village because it looks awkward in the middle of the street. Other than that its amazing.
This is 125 Minecraft maps of square distance!!!! Incredible. 👏
Where can i get it
80THTOUSAND?!??!!
You could do something like a pillage base unlike the outposts which are simply that, this could be were like the leader of the pillagers resides
Master sword from legends of zelda
If and when released is it possible to get this map on Ps4?
4000x4000 is 16 million, not 16 thousand lmao
you shuld trantsform the strongholed into a bunker
This is an amazing idea! Love from Korea!
Maybe do a cave themed biome underneath the snowy mountain biome, with like a pirate cove, which you can access from the ocean and with a dock nearby.
Amazing work please continue the project!
I like to have a mafia village in desert
this is why minecraft was made
Will you do any fantasy building like a castle in the plains biome or just stick to upgrading current structures?
I know it’s a massive ask, but please make this free. or give us a free trial or something like that. Would love to play this map but I don’t have the funds to buy it.  Amazing concept and great video
This. Is.                       Nice 👌
WOAH
W O W !
Congrats on 1 million!!!!
Sadly those villagers at the shop markets will die in the first wave ... no where to hide ...
4000x4000 = 16,000  ......... MafS
Looks amazing, can’t wait to see the next episode
Here’s an idea if you care for my opinion I see everyone and by that I mean literally everyone always make their desert Egyptian themed with pyramids and what not but what people forget and I wish I could see more of our builds of other desert civilizations Egypt wasn’t the only place with a desert one of my favorite genres of build I see barely anyone try to create is a Babylonian themed build asides making a classic giant pyramid what if it was a ziggurat or the hanging gardens of Babylon or even the Tower of Babel you have to remember that the first recorded civilization was in ancient Mesopotamia in the Babylonian empire or you even try a Persian themed build I just have been seeing pyramid after pyramid for desert builds with little variation and I would love it if there was more variation
Giant Fairy Tree!!!!PLZZZZ...can i play on pe?.. i have no pc :(
Gotta love it when this guy uploads 😊
This is...  insane.
Finally, some good fucking content
This is by far one of your best ideas! Can't wait for the world download
What is the thing at 2:27
Yes I love it muchas amor I want the download now
Trixyblox after you finish this you should make the resident evil village map
Ice cave hideout for pillagers( maybe)
fucking like the damn video
w o w   just wow
Looks fucking small
I'm so hyped for this oml. This is all I ever wanted to seeeee
THIS LOOKS INSANE PROPS TO TRIXY
I can not wait to play this map, holy hell this is amazing!
Can't wait for the result!! But does anyone know if I can play this map on my XBox One?  And how?
I can't wait!!!! I want this to be amazing! Subscriber earned!
make the caves 2
This looks insane!!!! Please finish it!!!
I’d be disappointed if there is no delorian time machine in the western mines
I wished that you put up a litle more structures
Notch look what a talent you’ve missed!
You are facking amazing builder wtf i love your videos !!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️
Yoooo this is so awesome
Underground cult base/dungeon deep inside a cave in the Tundra Biome👀
Star Wars is proud; you have made the Millineum Falcon an island.
Getting major Breath of the Wild vibes from this whole map
I want to see a huge tree.  The villagers could still, even though they’re pescatarian, have some sheep for wool, and cows for milk.
sea creature...levithan
cool
Woodland mansion?
This man out here creating lore for a Minecraft world.        You sir have my respect
If you see this comment, its time to like the video!
For hiding a little secret in snow biomes, what do you think about a destroyed ice castle or an ice meteorite
Isekai Type Plz
Wow
How has minecraft not hire him yet like MINECRAFT HELLLLOOOOOOO!!!!!
DOWNLOAD PLEASE!
How in the world do you make these builds!? And how long does it take to make them?
Add the cave of memes
Wich app you use on minute 1:25, from 1:57?? I always lose time making my oen islands block by block, I need it
I was actually playing on doing this to!
You should make a reference to the movie "The Thing" in the snow biome
The island should be named Bloxia
Notifications are on!
Don't forget about the sunflower fields and the flowers forests
Cool <3
wow
Or castle
I had an idea for the desert (obviously you don't have to do it tho). What if there were some ruins of an old civilization partially buried in the desert? I find the ancient Egyptian castles to be super cool with the tall, sloped walls and the pillars that were inside to hold up the ceiling.
sorry that I have to say it but            the island looks like a croissant
You should add A hidden Beginner base that used to be owned by the owners of the diaries
Hey Trixy we have the same mind you make big build while I make lore builds
How about a huge mountain base
Who else wants to see a cool looking mine??
i can’t wait to play this map
Best playeable custom map. Amazing!
Dude WOW  This is so cool when you are done could you put the world download in the description? That would be so cool  Anyway keep it up! 👌🏻
Would you be able to convert the world to bedrock once it's done? Or would you have to many problems with people stealing the map?
Some forgotten temple under the church would be nice, with a creepy journal left somewhere
When this is done will it be on Microsoft Store?
You brought up breath of the wild, and I feel like if normal Minecraft was more like this, it would top BOTW in my favorite games of all time.
wynncraft.............
Can you do some kind of Robin Williams Easter egg??
how can we get the world ,
Why don’t you work at mojang
EVERYBODY LIKE THE VID
Um... you forgot the swamp?
2:29 we will watch your career with great intrest
you should add towns like villages but bigger with walls and some with castles if you want to add it
it would be cool to see a big crater or something like a meteor hit a really long time ago
80 800 8k 80k 800k 8M 80M 800M 8B 80B 800B to infinity likes
How did u place tree so fast? Is there a brush for it? Im always struggle making forest.
You should hide a huge Nordic forge deep within the mines
Maybe you can make it into a marketplace map for us console players
I would like for there to be a flying city that's built like a castle made of quartz/marble blocks and has multiple levels with different buildings such as homes, a farm, and a library, etc.  I'm really hyped for this project! It looks so good already!
This looks amazing! I'm really looking forward to seeing what's next. Are you planning on upgrading the Nether and the End as well? I feel a customized End would be awesome :D
Can you make a now npc
Btw : on what version is it
I love this and i can't wait to play it!!!  But just one thing to say: There are to many villagers and not enogh houses. Build more pls.
Add a settlement in the mountain like Lord of the rings (erebor)
bro, please make the world download free
This project is crazy so excited to play on it. I hope there will be a lot of easter eggs, hidden chest, secrets spots....
"I thought it'd be more interesting to make clerics into these mysterious travelling merchants that sell items across the map" dang, if only there was already a travelling merchant villager mob that sells mysterious items across the map
Love the village disining
It looks sooooo good!!! It sucks I don't have minecraft. I would download it when it's out if I do.
Yooo that's just crazy! Much respect!
This is awesome man! When do you think this will be for download? :D
Would’ve been even more awesome if the mushroom biome island was like a broken fragment from the original Pangea like continent where it’s bigger than it was and like a giant asteroid smacked the island off the original continent and some alien mushrooms and mutations happened causing the whole island become mushroomfied or some other sci-fi thing plot but gotta say this map is very swick
Normal Youtuber: Let's transform this one builing TrixyBlox: Okay... Let's just build a whole new giant world put some buildings in it and transform ALL OF IT  i absolutely love you content, you put so much work un it ♡
I wonder if the pillager outpost will still function properly as a pillager spawn point
I think that this map, whit some mods, like alex's mobs or mowzy mobs, would be amazing🤩    Ps. The map is beautiful
I want more gf content lul 😭awesome project m8!!
i so wish i could build such cool stuff like this, definitely gonna download this one
Wow incredible. Cant wait to see the other biomes! 😍
This is cool kinda reminds me of rdr2
I cannot wait for this download!!!!! 😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑😑
Having watched the final episode in this series after a year, it is crazy to see how much of a difference there is from the start to the end! I am looking forward to playing this map when it comes out in a mont!!!
Build a floating island with so much source for survival
Trixy, you should separate out the biomes with more natural rivers and other landscape features as a nice transition, right now it's kind of jarring that all of the sudden you're in a mesa, as the train just changes abruptly.  I would also add some deformations to the continent as a whole, as it's too round atm to look natural.  If you can please supply a creative world with the buildings you used! It would be cool if we could add them to structure blocks in the default generation!  Also the plains would looks way more interesting with some mud pits, more ponds, some natural wheat, and maybe some unique terrain, like the cliff overhangs of Guar Plains in Xenoblade. =)  Also, sky island please, it would also be neat if you did a bit of the Nether as well!
Idk how to download it if you can download it ):
yes
Is the download going be free or will it be one of those "patreons only" type of thing?
those trees will be a pain lol
When he finishes the map, its going to be a free download, or its a patreon donation to get the download?
This is the biggest minecraft map I’ve ever seen
Congratulations for 1 mill 🥳🎉
Your videos make me wanna live in minecraft
Maybe hidden statues of you and your friends in diferent biomes
SO AMAZING!!!! THANKS FOR BEING YOU TRIXY!!!
For the spruce biome you could make some custom submerged rock structures
I am not a builder but I genuinely enjoyed this. Its 'peaceful' in a way. Can't wait to download this!!
An interesting story concept for this survival map could be that the nether originally in good terms with the overworld, but the citizens of the overworld had a prejudice against the inhabitants of the nether. The overworld citizens believed the inhabitants of the nether were demons and that the nether was some sort of hell, when in actuality the inhabitants of the nether were just mistaken as such. They were just a people that were literally from a different plane of existence. The nether was leaking into the overworld and the overworld citizens thought they were trying to invade and destroyed the portal. And any journals found about the events paint the nether inhabitants as demonic and that the nether was some sort of underworld. The said events happening millennia ago. This causes the people of the overworld to believe these events as fact.
I neeeed it!
Epic
bruh playing in this survival world is gonna be so hard cus im not gonna wanna break anything!! it's all so beautiful ;o;
Congrats dude on 1mill subs🥳🥳👍🏻
When he used a cleric as a travelling merchant : Sad wandering trader noises.
You are one of my new favorite Minecraft builders
how are you so good at building oml, im jealous
Trixy - its hard to build so small I normal build big, Me in my 3x3 house with a 2 block roof.
When you finish the overworld eventually, it would be cool if you made a custom nether and end. It would complete the survival feel. It looks amazing tho!
This looks awesome already, and ive got a question. Do the Structures still work, so do Pillagers still spawn at their outpost? or will they be a limited number? I would love to know. Anyway keep up the good work!
One word, *Shaders.*
Wow! I love this! I wish there was a download! I’m going to subscribe
Where's the download?
wow this is sick
this is so cool! and congrats on 1 mil❤
Me after seeing this- Oh yeah! Let's go build something!   Me two hours later rethinking my life choices after realizing that I STILL cannot build
Nice bro
This is just Catan in minecraft
something tells me this dude is still gonna keep going if we don't hit the like goal but goddamn he deserves it ,I'm exited to see how all of the biomes are transformed but I'm most curious about the mushroom biome ,how do you turn something that ugly into something beautiful while keeping its original base???
The master of builds is back
nice
GET THIS VID TO 80000K likes (DO NOW OR die =D)
Make it a MC, and make it anarchy, but no hacks.
I'm looking forward to seeing the result
I think the cart would be better to trap a wandering trader in, rather than a cleric.
1:13 the map looks like map of "wano land" from " one piece" anime
Have you ever thought of working in Game design company as an artist of sorts? Cuz you seem to have a pretty good vision of game themes and logistics behind them. Also these builds require skillsets that usually tend to take a whole group of proffesionals, you even put some storytelling in them which is a very nice yet barely noticable touch. Good job 👍
Can you pls build the old Fortnite map in Minecraft ?
How about you add under big Mountains a big Icey Cave where you can find some ,,big Secrets''
awesome!! can’t wait to see the next biome :)
If you do make it downloadable, can you add a bedrock version too?
Maybe you can do the story line? Bit of quest, going to diferent arreas and boss fight. I think it is good idea
I would live a map download of even just the map vanilla map :) Also, will this map be survival compatible / have caves and resources underground, etc?
This is the ultimate goal i have for my minecraft world.. But still no where close for it to being done..
Add a waterfall behind the windmill that flows into the farm!
Please release the next video quick
Kinda seems like it would be a map for a Zelda game, Just add some temples and there you go!  (edit) oh
we want a sarvival siereas
That was.... Incredibule
you should try not just finding a treasure but multiple treasures for one big treasure to make this all make since like a story of multiple people hiding these treasures and unlocking the secrets behind this mysterious island
Can u make this in bedrock so I and other people can play it
Voici un commentaire pour le référencement
I just sub right now, your buildins are awesome, hope to see more soon ^_^
You should add a taiga forest temple. ❤️
Poggers
You forget flower forest
This reminds me of Catan lol
This reminds me of Carson lol
brooo!! this is so cool! i can’t wait to see what you do with all the other biomes!
wow
I know this is long shot and doesn't fit in. But what if you had keys in each biome that unlocked the stronghold to the end.
😭 y’all I could neva y’all you tubers be doing my dreams
This is amazing,  cant wait for the next biom <3
good Minecraft world 🌍  wowwww 👍👍👍
This is so epic
Bro you need to make movies. You are so fricken creative
How do you get this map ?
Looks like battle royale fortnite map
I’d love to see the mushroom biome have a giant rotting tree with a village around it.
Im so excited for this
9:43 i find it hilarious.. That you didnt even include beetroot.. 😂😂
you should add a cave village in a modified cave system if you can
You should make the ruined portals staircase look more like crumbled
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhhh
Get this man some likes!!
U should be hired by everyone bro!
Ngl kinda looks like a rust map lol.
cant wait for part 2 :D
Add caves and ores
This will be so deadly as a playable map!
Absolutely insane, can't wait to see the next parts it's absolutely beautiful work here
Don't forget the caves!!! You gotta add custom caves and cave structures Custom loot is also something cool you could do
Do a underwater bimom
What about a blacksmith?
Omg I’m so excited for this!!! I might have to do a play through on my channel😳(shouting you out every 4 minutes every episode because of how sick this is)
Bob Ross is the best painter
YOUR 1 EYE IS FAKE ??????
When Trixy uploads everyone’s day gets better, and you can’t say it doesn’t.
This is the most inspirational video I've ever seen btw love you trixy💙💙💙
Nice trixy best builder
Brush ya teeth
I love your creativity😅🤭
add some custome mods for an optional version of the world with maybe  some guns for the wild west area or a yeti for the snow biome
It would be cool for you to bring back up the map time to time in the series and update where we are when you are putting in major locations
Update 1.19: Villages and Pillagers Update. *small word changes cause* :D
I want this map how do I buy one from you
“and with that, we finished our plains biome”  *N A N I ?*
i think it’s be cool if u added more of the ”magical” vanilla structures such as the stonghold or the igloo!
You're amazing I just saw this video on my recommended and I discovered an actual legend this is so inspiring and so nice of you to actually let us witness your greatness
beautiful
Love the video, can’t wait for the next!
Fuckin Legend
YOU SHould sendthe finished world to DanTDM coz he lost hardcore
This looks amazing! I’m very excited to see what happens next. I’m not exactly sure how well you can edit the Nether, but it would be cool to see your designs on some of the structures in there!
The pillager outpost is better than most of my builds on its own
Ah yes, 4000 times 4000 equals 16000
I swear to god plssssss join hermitcraft
this looks like straight from open world game
this is so cool, i’m stoked :D !
you should add a underworld of people stuck down below that will be cool ( people who is underground)
Definitely should reach out to Mojang and get this added to the marketplace.
Maybe that mushroom island should have like a ginormous mushroom in the center or some mushroom caves
Some of the trixy village houses are better lookin then mine maybe villagers deserve it or maybe not 😏.....
Why does this have 40k views and only 12k likes? do people not want this map?
I thought that HONEY ADVERT that RUDELY INTERRUPTED ME was actually you, soz for thinking sutch horrid things trixy. (I'm not being sarcastic)
Can't wait to play it 😊
love it! cant wait for the jungle, and maybe you could make one of those massive jungle trees that you see in avatar?
Can you put like a secret lost city in water that no one knows abt and can only be entered if you've found each part of something in every biom O:   ?????
Did you model the shape after the country of amestrus from full metal alchemist, it’s the exact same shape
In the desert, you should have a pyramid with a tomb with boobytraps. In the snowy mountains you should have a bear cave or old mine. This project looks great already!
you cant tell me that island isnt wanokuni
This just needs a coral reef, no world is complete without those
next video: I edited the real world and got the continents into a supercontinent
Will you make this a server because I would love it
First off amazing Video the Island looks awesome and the structures are breathtaking second you could build Tempels with treasure for the snow or mountain biom I think they would fit well
Soo do i watch these videos or wait for the world to rlease so i can explore? Ahhh help
You overdetail structures a bit too much imo but I still like it. Cool idea too
4000 x 4000 is 16000000 btw im sure you realised when watching all the comments
Can you try making a new stronghold design?
Me makes a Nice house for villagers bed water and everything  Villager: Nah dirt is good
get 80,000 likes i want this world please!!!
the wagon couldve been a wandering traders wagon.
That was so amazing
Hola guiris uwu
You forgot swamps
I would have added small little creeks and rivers in the plain, jungle or dark forest biomes with maybe some willows to add a little bit more realism and atmosphere
5 star
Do the nether and the end next for this world !!!!
This is so cool! First thing that came to mind was a hunger games arena
I like the idea of uprading everything, great work! 👍
Can I get it on bedrock console
Please this is your 1 million map so make it free.
I need to play in this world
tell me why once he added the trees in the bee area all my stress went away
It would be really nice if the windmill Blades were a little bit more dinámic. Nice video🙂
Anyone else bothered that one of his eyes has no lashes
really EPIC video this is SOOO COOL
11:46 the wagon’s wheels could’ve looked better with those very dark oak planks and maybe normal oak buttons in the middle
are you going to upgrade the nether and end too?
This is so awesome
44,192 th
your iris looks almost black
When this is done, I can't wait to see servers use it, hopefully we'll get an SMP out of it with prominent Minecraft players, exploring the world you've singlehandedly created
I would legit love some huge skeletons in the desert. Or some frozen  non hostile enemies in chunks of Ice if the latter is even possible.
I’ve built a few giant trees in my world you should see
Mega
I feel like there are more than 10 biomes, but yeah there are 10 major biomes. Me after seeing the very 1st transformation (the ruined portal): OMG LET'S GOOO THAT LOOKS AMAZING. :0 Oh wow this video was only for the plains? This is gonna be epic. Loving the new designs. I really hope a modder can work with you to create a mod that changes vanilla structures (and also the trees) and adds the redesigns. It would be interesting if the boulders were also added, but idk if that needs to be added as well. But I gotta say that this is looking like it's going to turn up pretty epic. What's the render distance used near the beginning and also used to show the time lapses, though? It seems like he can look pretty far out.
I think you should get someone to put custom loot chests around the map
YESSSS
this mod would so fricking well with the ice and fire mod and other mods in general
tf ur a God
Mojang needs to hire you
this is very nice
This is so epic great good looks so good!!!! I hope in the taiga biome there is a huge spruce tree as a reference to SAO that would be cool
I can't wait to see more! This is amazing!!! 😍
This is so awesome I would love to play this one day!
I would Love to use this map in my Hardcore world or any other world its Awesome!
All I hear is get this video to and I just hit it
He’s too powerful
there are a total of 3 different people in Minecraft: the fighter, the speedrunner, and the builder.
When 1.17 part 1 you should upgrade this
you could add some custom structures like an obsidian asteroid with some precious ores in the center or some kind of things like that to give the world more history
If you do a world download I will try to add the structures to minecraft as a mod so that they naturally generate
the villagers hired the best contractor and gave him a 5 star review on yelp
Not being picky, but I really wish I could find stuff like this on the ps4 minecraft market. Builds like these really make me happy, and hearing that there is a story along with it makes me giddy.
What the heck I was literally just writing about an island with all of those biomes and trying to figure out how I would position them like I did a double take cuz the thumbnail was exactly what I was going for. Either I'm a prophet or you're a straight up wizard.
Cool
Please add mythical creatures like dragon fossil or big snake
Please make this accessible for bedrock, and  have it cost 900-1100 for those who want it.
Put the ender portal
IMPLIMENT A MUDER MYSTERY!!!!
this looks sick, maybe if you can edit spawn, because your adding diaries and stuff in the villages, you should like shipwreck on the island and try to find out where you are and what's going on, kinda like a survival adventure map that leans heavily on survival
Are you going to add a stronghold? Because every minecrafter has been wanting a better and updated stronghold.
Herobrine hut? also I think that the village needs more farm land. Great build tho!
I’m exited for someone to do a 100 days challenge on this map
BUILD IDEA!  How about caves and dungeons? :3
Could you make this downloadable for all versions of Minecraft if possible? Otherwise amazing work
love this series，pls make more
Suggestion: you could create some sort of a mushroom cave. Another suggestion: you could create a sort of roller coaster out of the mesa caves or the railroad.
do you think he will transform the nether?
The legend of Zelda also has a few biomes and the planes on worked out quite well
your content is sooooo coooooool
He should make it a multiplayer
couldnt the wandering trader be the travelling merchant?
may you make like a prison. like Arkham asylum. idk what it has to do with the story but I recon it would look good in a forrest.
This looks soo good. I think for the jungle biome you could ad a massive ancient tree and maybe that can be where the people worshipped, or maybe even inside of the tree. This is just an idea.
Cool!
773rd
Wait did he even put a swamp?
The people who disliked are mad because he didn’t upgrade the grass block
"The church still feels small." *Literally bigger than my entire base in MC*
Mods on this would be sick
I have an idea: what if you made a cool castle in the center of  the entire map Edit: Jungle biome village would be nice. and maybe transforming the nether and end to boot in a future episode?
Never hit so fast.. havent seen it yet but dang if u make i map i hope wed be able to play in it!!!
What about doing an Icy cave showing something from the past in the ice
Hyped
Add a meteor crater
Make for the desert 🐫: A ancient Egyptian style with 🌴 and river Oasis resembling the Nile
A cave temple...but up side down 😏
Can someone make a mod that makes all Worlds like this?
This is really cool
This world is incredible. TrixyBlox deserves the 80k likes that he asked for.
Do part 2
Minecraft better take some notes.
Been up for 1hour and has 8k likes. I think it’s gonna make it
watch this video to destroy your minecraft self esteem
You make it look so easy
YOOOOOOOOO, absolutely amazing work trixy! I've been watching your videos for a while now and I've actually used you as inspiration for some of my own builds. Love your work man!
try making a normal size city or do something in bedrock edition
This is amazing, always wanted a custom survival world to explore! Will the world download be available for bedrock or just java?
im so excited for the rest of the biomes!!! i cant wait so see the transformations and learn the backstory of this world!
This was posted an hour ago and there's already 11K likes. Over 8K likes in just an hour!
Nice build but i think you can build an graveyard in your build
Can you please build hogwarts, including the black lake and the dark forest, as a new projekt after the vanilla island?
You should make a mod pack for the different biomes
We all want the world download
This makes me wanna play with toys and be a kid again lol. These builds really brings the adventure to life
Tbh, the 80000 like goal is really low what you're doing
Guys get to 80k likes on this video
I can't wait to play in this world omg!!!!!
This would be an awesome world to play on with some friends. Id take over the pillager place because it looks dope.
this is amazing and its amazing what you can build.
omg i love the breath of the wild inspired stuff
Ugh, y did i have to watch this when im not home, my brain went flooding with ideas and inspirations
you should've put the wandering trader in the wagon and swapped out the horses for lamas
6:52 “dummies, you dummy”
buzzin for this ngl
buzzin for this ngl
make the deserd a huge tower and at the top mak eth estart of the treasure map and go alone from there
Is the map free and for minecraft bedrock edition
I think the world download should be available no matter what... I feel like I am being punished for something my sibling did. Just because some people don't like the video doesn't mean we all don't like it... According to the amount of likes while I am writing this comment there are over 9000 people wanting the download... Please?
I honestly cant wait to see what happens with this, i really want to play in this world lol, i wonder if hell do the nether and the end too
Thii is amazing😵🤯😲
It would be good to get a mod with custom bosses in each place
Great Gob!!
Wow i just saw this on recomendation and this is amazing
Literally one of the coolest minecraft projects I think I’ve ever seen, can’t wait!
This is gonna be incredible
i never thought there would be trixyblox lore
the world reminds me of bionicles or something old i can't remember everything
Trixyblox on hermitcrat season 8?
This us so exicting i can,t wait for part 2 minecraft should really feature these types of villages
I wish Minecraft looked like this that would be epic
wow
your videos make my day :)!!!
its here
Can you customize the nether in this world too?
someone should make a mod where all your revamped structures are there instead of the normal ones
HERE BFR THIS BLOWS UP
You need to make aquatic bones too
kind of reminds me of West World
If you could make a Mushroom Villagers in the Mushroom biome: https://www.planetminecraft.com/mob-skin/mushroom-villager-4599705/  Have Mushroom farms:  Just Hoed Mushroom Farmland: https://i.imgur.com/HJro6pT.png  Wet Mushroom Farmland: https://i.imgur.com/HvSOqYl.png
Please build a old trainbrigde over a canyon in the Mesa biom
How do I download this map?
I'm really excited to see what you do with the secret underground room underneath the igloo!
The whole idea is absolutely amazing. Similarities from Skyrim and other RPG games coming together in Minecraft, and especially in this map just blows me away. I'd love to get my hands on this adventure map 🙌
Sir if it’s playable can we play it on switch?
this world is looking crazy so far, nice work!
The ideas of this map, and the map in general remind of horizon zero dawn, though I’m not sure why
Trixy can I please have the world template that you built all this on? I want to try to build my own little revamp of this(I’m not that good but I would love to try)  This whole build is absolutely amazing!
Why is this so perfect??
Your creations are absolute amazing...keep going!!
It's kinda sad this world download is only for Vanilla Minecraft players.
I love botw, I like how you used inspiration from it
Kinda sad I get so proud of myself when I make a dirt hut
Can you add a custom stronghold as well?
This freaking map is insane, I'm already excited to see what you do for the next one. The music was great too!
Trixy you should make a half broken bridge over to the mushroom biome that has mushrooms taking over part of the bridge
Bro we love you But we can see That u are not  Sleeping well So We can wait U can get ur Sleep bro
LOVE IT.   Just imagine jeb and notch taking notes.
Please like this video!!
Wow
I would love to see the huge underground mines be like a labyrinth of sorts that would block the entrance and make you have to find your way out
Seeing you make the stuff you do is always really captivating to me and never fails to get me riled up. It makes me want to learn code to make mods to match this, or makes me imagine my own lore that could happen in this world and inspires me to think of my own imaginary world as well. That's why I love you videos so much man, they always get my own imagination going. The builds are also incredible of course, but to me that's not the main thing.
This looks incredible. I can’t wait for the Mesa biome. I love building in the “Wild West” style. I built a pretty sweet tavern in one of my worlds with a pool table and bar, and up floor restaurant. It was awesome.
cant wait to destroy it all 😀
Why can I just hit like one time?? D:
the waggon reminded me of Duke from resident evil
This is sick
Good luck  Don't forget to have fun
can u like work for mojang and like get them to upgrade the real minecraft world like this please
Why can’t we give him more subscribers this guy has a talent congrats I’m looking forward to play in this world
Alright someone create this on bedrock lol can't leave them hanging
Quick little idea: for the snowy mountain biome when you get to it, you should do some icy caves in the mountains that open up to a larger area with a big reflective floor, like a false Minecraft mirror made of ice or something  just a suggestion cause i know whatever you have planned will be AMAZING  keep up the sick builds Trixy
the next video: I built wynncraft
The plains village must have a good amount of trade with the spruce forest if they have so much spruce wood on their roofs
maybe a monke village in junge biom?
You should make a true mine somewhere, with working mine carts, transport elevators, vast underground tunnel networks, a real scale blast furnace with the chemical processes required to smelt ores, purify them, cast objects, etc. Gold mine in the mesa biome
Brother u can make a dam on the river which will make the world more interesting
You should male a broken hanging bridge that connects the mushroom island amd the plains
You should add a mushroom grove in the roofed forest with glowing fungi and stuff. :D
He's better than Mojang.... It's been proven
This is just a suggestion but trixy what if you add like a huge world tree in the middle or anywhere. Also it could be named yggdrasil. But, its your choice.                                                                                                                                             .                                                                                                                                                                                                                .                                                                                                                                                                                           I just hope trixy comes across this comment it would mean a lot
I use to build for youtubers are servers and this is the type of project I would get out of my minecraft retirement for
Mojang should really hire you to do some work forreal
I'm wondering if the nether will be vanilla or also customized 🤔 if it was custom then it would be a cool part of the story where you need to finish the portal and go thru it to do something
Keep it up woo
ForgeLabs should do a video about it 😶
image if this was a mc generation mod 😳
Yo this looks like something wynncraft would make
It has 9.252 likes and 30.119 views when this comment came out
Bedrock edition download??? Pocket edition too
Flying dragon castle hehehe
I really wanna play your survival map soo bad. You're awesome
Ok
what if in the mushroom island there is like a subterranean type of fungus that has made his own home under the island
The stairs on the portal ruin could be a bit more ruined but otherwise it looks great 👍
Where swamp
when will we get a base world release for download? Id wanna try to do abit of project on my own sense im a new builder*=
i love the quiet bit of diversity he’s going add with other places of worship that isnt the “default” of Christianity and a priest and whatnot
Awsome but will there be a woodland mansion
im so hyped for this
Dragons in the mountain caves
I really appriciate your work and I litterly haven't seen anyone else doing this
Every time I watch this guy's videos I just become awe-struck by the creativity and effort he puts into these builds. Can't wait for the next part!
Can't wait for the next parts 😂
When the island is sus😳
Why have people disliked this
Im trying to think of something to say but... I legit cant
Why not make the Ocean Monument a temple for the Greek god Poseidon? Would also really love to see something mystical in the snow biome.
why does he not have eyelashes on one eye
imagine this was how vanilla minecraft worlds were generated
whenever u release the map can u make a bedrock edition version, pls
This is just simply too good
this shit wants me to be notefied about it. and that doesn't happen a lot for me...
You're so amazing at building with so much detail you're just awesome I like to see more❤️👌
Wow that looks nice
I wish you did this earlier because I want to binge watch it
minecraft plus
this is like Wano-kuni from one piece
This is looking amazing dude! Can’t wait for the next episode.
huge dungeons
Him: "And I got some inspiration from BOTW"  Me, who used to be a switch player but has Migrated to PC: *Sheds a tear* I haven't that name in years, and never have I felt so, so wonderful, and nostalgic. But seriously though, that plains chapel looks just like the temple of time, keep up the great work!  And also another thing, I really think a taiga inspired by like the Korok Forest I think? Either way the one with the Master Sword in it, and have the Master Sword as an Easter egg! It fits the taiga theme reall well even if you decide to not do the Master Sword, just a suggestion and have a good one! (I might look at more BOTW biomes and give more suggestions, I really like the idea of the and where it is going!)
I thought the wandering trader was gonna go in the wagon
you upgraded literally everything... soo? What's next? lol
In the snowy mounatins it would be cool to see an ancient society frozen away from the world
Please make the 80.000 likes so I and all others can download this.
You should add a custom nether as well
Can you make it available for mobile 2 it's look cool😊
Trixy is so underrated it’s criminal!
This looks incredible, and I really appreciate all the detail and story you are putting into this custom world. I can't wait to jump in and explore it!!
i really like how he transformed them, they look just vannilla-ish to be cool
Trixy: mmh im kinda bored by only doing my biggest project ever which is probably going to take hundreds of hours lets also transform the whole minecraft world... I love it!
You should also make a texture pack for certain items.
PLZ GET US TO DA LIKE GOAL QwQ I want to play dis map once i get java (also for the jungle I kinda think it should be MORE over grown with a cave that houses a old, abanded House in it, like those starter homes we all make at one pount in our lifes. I love Your videos ad was wondering if I choud have a shout out? love your work!)
Twin Peaks reference in the taiga biome pls
I really love this. I hope you contiue this project, it would be really awesome.
Sick
I would love if you create something under the wild west town . Like a secret base.
please if u release the map dont forget the bedrock edition 🙏🙏🙏
Wait can I play on this map ?! ( Bedrock ps4) this looks crazy man 👏 🔥
Add a second river and some water fall type thing in the mountains
seriously this is insanely cool! I'm so looking forward to more videos, your talent is on another level
ZELDA BREATH PF DA WILD IS SO GOOD
And just yesterday I was thinking how great it would be if you created a whole map for Survival or Adventure mode with a whole story/plotline... AND Here it begins!
Giant woodland mansion in dark oak forest
16000000 blocks
Fans: So what are you going to upgrade next Trixy? Trixy: Yes
Massive underground ice cave with a bunch of crystals, ore veins and a small village, but not a city though. The entrance to the cave is somewhere completely arbitrary in the snowy mountains and small enough it could be mistaken for perhaps a small little cove, barely noticeable.
Why are you not a Minecraft designer you are insane
Add a massive dwarf castle on that’s southern inland like the dwarf castle in the movie hobbit
Pc go brrrrrr
hi
I’m curious, do the ores spawn ? As it is a man-generated world, I’m skeptical
Oscar, this is literally the coolest idea ive ever seen
this is so damn cool
They should make a new hunger games in this giant map
I would love to see a underwater drowned village/ dungeon
Tixy never ceases to amaze me.
StarWars stuff, like the rebel base on Hoth
Will you make a smp with this map? I think this can be a good smp map for the lore of the world.
You have to have a big castle hidden away in the snowy mountains
I am very excited for this project and hopefully many minecraft youtubers would play, explore and have fun in this map so they could also share the experience to people who couldn't play the game. I really really admire you're dedication. you sound happy talking about what you do and it's really nice to listen to. so artistic! though we're not in the same page you always give me a feeling of rush to draw and write. Thank you!
U neeeddd plays an airhave 😂💕
It would be crazy if used the create mod to make static features that mimic motion actually mobile.
transfor a witch hut
THIS IS FUCKING INCREDIBLE IT'S SO AWESOME
guys i need this map so bad, press the fuckin like
Put a secret in one of the boulders Please
Yoooo!!! Trixy!!! This was pure inspiration!!! I can't wait to see what you do in the next biomes!!!
"minor changes being made" okay sure
I would love to play on this world. You could maybe do a mosque in one of the other biome villages. Are you gonna redo underground structures like Mineshafts and dungeons? I think that would be cool to see
The head designer for Minecraft is punching the air right now
desert well
wow so f**king cool!!!!
I would like to see an overgrown or abandoned pillager outpost that continues into a cave underground with some captive villagers and loot.
This would be a great hunger games map
If this were vanilla, i would cry!
Could you also do a world-download which is this same world, but before you upgraded the buildings and biomes? Partially for a before and after, and partially so that if people also want to try their own hand at this same thing...  And by people I mean me, I want to try my hand at this with the same base map, it sounds really fun
You should have a classic Herobrine spawner hidden somewhere. Y'know, like the gold, cobble, netherack and redstone torch ones. It obviously won't do anything besides make the player chuckle or shiver. They might even get some gold out of it lmao.
Wow!
It would be cool to add a small kingdom. In one of the biom
in the snowy area, you should have a small cave entrance going to a big cave. in the cave you should add Snowdin from Undertale.
I would like you to include a abandon wooden shack in the tundra biome
He should add a medieval castle
villager torture dungeon under a secret trapdoor in a pillager outpost
a dragon ritual or like summoning would be cool as a secret
EPIC EPIC
Hey, i really loved your content and i used to be a pro builder like you are but nowdays i can't repurchase minecraft could you may help? if not then no worries keep it up
Can't wait to see more of this 🤩 I wish, i would be that good in building, is there an upload plan for part 2 and the following episodes?
Can we get the world download whit no patron pls
Please upload this world to realms it would be epic and then some friends can play your world together if they have realms. Love your videos, keep it up.
there is a nether you know this will became a whole lot of work
Yes
It’d be super cool if the pillagers got their own town, maybe repurposing the abandoned village as a massive pillager fortress or keep? With the mansion spawning in dark oak forests it would be super cool and add a bit of lore to the world! Since maybe the pillager factions are united under one leader trying to take over the continent?
What if you got the hermitcraft people (grian Mumbo jumbo, rendog, Bdubs etc)  to do a series playing through your map, that would be awesome, I don’t know if you can even get in touch with them, but if that could be done PLEASE DO IT
Your literally awesome man, I really like your videos! 😍🤯
trixyblox you sudde add a kingdom with a village and some Viking boats next to the farm just like the world of Skyrim
I have ideas Upgrade the Pillager mansion With  Adding Small pillager mansions  For the illusioner  If you don't know what an illusioner is its an illager that has fakes of him self Make it when you enter the ruined Portal you spawn in a prison In a costum bastion Make an ocean monument  Into a ocean mansion that alien fish live in because that's what my base is based on It took me 2years though but it's worth it Make a dungeon under the mushroom island for a Minotaur  Make an ender sky mansion in the end with battle ships all around it Make a giant hole that has a full max enchanted netherite giant zombie  Trying to get out Make a core in the middle of the map powered by a giant either with no AI Those are my ideas
The place where you wanted to add a shipwreck, you should add an astronaut in the ocean somewhere close lmaooo
can we see what this looks like without all the shaders?
I know absolutely nothing about minecraft but this map looks beautiful great job trixyblox 🥰
You should've added a swamp as an in between for the dark oak and the jungle
Your projects are always so crazy!! I love them, don’t stop!!!
Already love this project❤️❤️❤️
Cool looks like pacman
Cant wait for the mushroom island can u plz do that next :)  🤞🤞🍄
If Minecraft had a base ( somewhat like a tutorial world) world I wish it would be something like this with the hidden secrets and book entries documenting things someone else found before you
Amazing work! Definitely gonna need a world download after it's done! :)
You forgot the swamps
How about creating a glacier in the snowy mountains biome? You could do cool stuff with it like making an ice cave similar to Skaftafell in Iceland.
this shows what vanilla minecraft is great, igt gives this sense of ''i can do way better than this village'' and thats how you starts talents like these
Maybe in the snowy mountains you could do something inspired by the Himalayan temples or architecture of Nepal and Tibet up in the mountains?
-This is madness! -No, this is TrixyBlox!
You should add a castle like from the original tutorial world
@trixyblox Are the interiors finished ?
nice, you could do a collab with someone, terraforming like goodtimeswithscar, that is a very big compliment by the way
Dinosaur 🦖 fossils f
You should make statues of gods like if it is a water god a kinda water biome with a castle and stuff
this is amazing
If you're thinking about using different religions in different biomes, how about a Buddhist temple tucked away in the snowy mountains?
So would you go into a more norse pagan temple for the Snow biome?
Make polar bear caves
"I transformed an entire Minecraft world" might get more clicks, but idk (edit: it'd probably also have to say part 1)
trixy you should add an upgraded woodland mansion!!!
This would be the best update to me of minecraft does something like this for an update make every biome realistic looking and giant with great views
this is so dope omg
Maybe a secret wizard college building like winterhold in Skyrim for the snowy mountains since you were talking about the merchant selling mysterious magical stuff
I was going to subscribe when I realized I apparently already did... That's convenient lmao
Will you do the stronghold as you’ll need it to beat the game
My one and only complaint is that that windmill's blades look downright anorexic. I'd add a couple more rows of fencing and wool because that barely looks like it'd catch a gale ^^;
I think a cool thing to include would be some kind of magical forest underground, with like lanterns and the blue leaf stuff from the Nether. That would add a bit of depth idk
Need more regular houses in the plains village if you ask me but it still looks crazy 🥱
Noice
Did anyone notice that trixy called us Dummies LOL 😂 6:53
Him: Transforms Minecraft basically  Me: getting hyped when I finish my dirt mansion (15x15 only) after a month
Maybe you could add a flower valley,and us it or incorporate it with the story in the future?
sheeesh builds looking good my man
i want to play this so bad but I play on xbox D:
EVERYTHING NOW!
Do a Jungle Temple revamp in the Jungle
Can u make a attack on Titan build .....maybe ur next large build can be the 3 walls of attack on Titan with the cities and all
try a volcano in the snowy mountains
Bro publish this to planet minecraft plz
Im so hiped
I like your video From Thailand 🇨🇷
GO LIKE HIS VIDEO!! WE NEED THIS SERIES TO CONTINUE!!!!
Imagine if you accidentally click "delete world" 😅
Cmon guys 80k likes, I want this world   Edit: please make campsites throughout the tallest mountain, referencing mount. Everest, also try and recreate one of the ships from pirate of the Caribbean or the titanic as the shipwreck
I would love to see the mysterious sea serpents of the underground kingdom...
Just wow, RESPECT!👍👍👌
and upgrade the end ships and cities
and he should add extra end crystals inside of the obsidian towers
Because of the Ruined Portal and since you're doing story with this build, you should update the nether and it's naturally generated structures. If you want, that is.
Upgrade the nether and the end too please!!! The nether might be difficult...
Monsters on the mushroom Island. Like a big blue dino
who are the 3 people who disliked this
Are you going to do anything for the nether?
I can’t wait to see the final result! This map has to be legendary ! This is by far one of my favorite series now !!🤩🤩
Plain biomes usually have a forest as well so if u add a forest it will fill in that empty space
Idk who are you Idk what is ur Chanel about  All i know that im early
The scale of these mountains and biomes are beautiful
I think trixyblox should add a custom meg strong hold inside of the snow mountains with a 6x6 end portal
I play on bedrock so could you maybe try to make the server cross platform it looks really cool and I want to join :edit are you going to upgrade the nether biomes and end?
Although I love the underground and underwater kingdoms this is the type of world building I live for, massive worlds that scream ADVENTURE it really makes me want to do some DnD games
this'll be super dope tysm man
I think a spruce village should look like  la viking village or  town
WOW 👍
secret abandoned research lab in mountains ? also this is amazing!
Can you make a mod, where you replace the vanilla buildings with the yours?
This is so beautiful,good job man.
Pirate treasure, Indian Jones type adventure, maybe a potential story line on how we ended up on this island (crashed airplane/spaceship?). Would be cool to have an underground area with Dino remains. Secret tunnel from avatar. There’s honestly a lot of stuff you could add from fantasy/adventure movies alone lol   Ps. Would be cool if it can be compatible with a mod pack tailor designed for the world, can’t wait to see what you’ll add!
Mount Rushmore
Jowww this is sick man
This map looks somewhat similar to wano from one piece
Please add something like a prison somewhere. Would be nice to see.
There could be like a test site bunker in the dark forest
very epic minerman <3
LORE IDEA: Maybe you could reference a great war and alliances between the different biomes in the other builds to be a part of the backstory of the map.
If you say everything I am assuming you mean the end, nether, the overworld, and the shulker dimension lol.
You deserve 1 Million subscribers
That one dislike in first 15 minutes is messing with me
You can make not a town in ice biome but a city that is not mordern but is like an ancient city
Looking good! Are you gonna transform the nether too? And the end maybe even come to think of it
I’m actually working on a world just like this but I don’t use mc edit so its gonna take a while
OMG ITS THE FORTNITE ISLAND lol
I don't know if you have ever heard of The Game Theorist, but he has a theory that enderman once were the humans who romed the eath before Steve and Alex.  Maybe you could create a cult that worship the enderman as a nod to this theory?
This thing is cool. I would love to live in the mesa biome
Trixy should get the "Builder of the Year" award, because this is awesome
You should add witch village, or pillager village.
TAKE MY MONEY
I think it would be awesome if you somehow included TangoTek's villager mod into this project. Make a minecraft++ type experience.
The Stonecutter is where you seem to have stopped thinking practically. You MUST remember when designing this stuff that you have to keep in mind the practicality and utility of the things you're designing. A medieval village is typically meant to be not just a place of shelter, but a place of comfort and quiet. A massive stone-smasher would disturb EVERYONE nearby every time it was used. To that end it would have been more suitable to locate the stonecutter bit of a ways outside of the villiage proper, with something nearby to act as a sound barrier. For example, a copse of tall trees, or perhaps hills. I also noticed a distinct absence of leather tanners, which would, again, be on the outskirts of town due to the noxious smell of the chemicals that tanners use. Typically tanners and smithies would be located on the eastern side of town to keep them mostly downwind of the rest of town. You should also add in a tavern or pub somewhere centrally located, perhaps near the church, as a meeting place for the villagers. And don't forget the all important warning bell for pillager raids.
Are you going to do caves
POV: You're a villager, one day a random player in tights upgrades your measly house BY TENFOLD, for free
There should be a underwater cavern at the start of that lake
like the goddamn video already!!
Please can you do a back to the future reference when you are doing the wild west one please
Are you adding a mine shaft
Can you do a bedrock world download?
Is there a stronghold ???
In the Mesa u should totally do a wagon falling off the cliff and people trying to save it
Good vid brother!
I want Mushroom houses in the Super Mario style!
Honestly, these builds are better than RLcraft auto generated builds.
You could also make a mansion in the dark oak forest
How about surrounding the villages with crop fields? To act like a gradual phase from wilderness to urban. Just an idea. Love your vids and can’t wait for the next one! Hopefully soon!
Bruh
It’s soooooooo damn beautifully cool
Eeeeee
I want to see a destroyed desert village, like a sand storm buried it
Maybe do like a Yggdrasil and the 9 realms type build in the future??
Please add a vocanic island with a large volcano
I would love to see a hidden Plants vs Zombies reference in the abandoned zombie village
You should add a lore/backstory to it that a person playing it can discover and piece together as they journey through the world
what if u have a shipwreck with death sea serpent from bone blocks
ice castle ice castle
Next! Next! Next
OMG, this is amazing. THIS IS SO GOOD. OMG love this. You should do a series where you build a medieval kingdom country. That would be epic.
Get him to 80000 likes
This is absolutely incredible. I can't wait for the final map! I look forward to streaming it! Edit: Where do I download this current map?
It will be cool if you made a wall in the village
That's sick.... LEGEND
Perfect, Just perfect
yo, you should do the walls of paradis from aot next, and awesome work!
Your content is unique and is always jaw dropping, I though for one of the biomes maybe the snowy/ mountain tundra you could build some sort of Japanese village, or some sort of giant spikes and a dead ice dragon. After you do the over world you should try this but with the nether biomes
damn....
You forgot the swamp biome!!!
Can we just appreciate how he never click baits
If you use the create mod then the windmeal can spin
bc of u i now get disappointed if i join a normal survival world because it looks so much worse then all ur worlds
Plz make more and make the winter piligers Vikings
WAIT...I NEED TO SEE THE FULL TRANSFORMATION...I CAN'T WAIT...NOOOOOOOOOOO
it looks a bit like Drehmal: primordial (minecraft map), its excellent
How much do you want to upgrade? Trixyblox: Yes!
POG ? Pog.
make a gigantic kirby
how long did this take?
Do you think it is possible to do one of these, but with mods? I am very curious to see the results and the types of builds that would be made from them.
80k tomorow
Add a str!pclub under the map :)) #irony
That thumbnail looks a lot like the....       Amog us
Thats a nice boulder
if you have played pokemon sword or shield you know that place with the name like snowchester or something for the snow biom you should do something like it.
This looks sooo good
It will be also awesome if you redesign the nether part connected to the ruined portal!!!!🤘🏻🤘🏻
love it
so glad you uploaded agian
This deserves at least 100 million views
Amazing
I would love to see some ruins of something medieval in the plains or snowy biome. Like a castle, or maybe a city, perhaps a harbour.
Can u make a map that just has the terrain and No structures? I would Love to transform the map myself! Great hype
Can someone please port it to bedrock
I don't know a bit of English (I used the translator) but I love watching this guy's videos
that is SO frickin COOL!!!
U are the best man 🤩 hello from Azerbaijan.👋❤❤❤
Reminds me of the Hunger Games.
This Man is a madlad, also maybe you can build some type of base for the pillagers in the dark oak forest similar to the mansion maybe
BIIIIGGGGG hype has been made!!!! 😍😍
Make a GIANT cavern with some cave people, and mineshafts, and spawners! :) For the spruce biome you could ad elk or caribou.
Don't forget to add Woodland Mansion and The Stronghold 🔥🔥🔥!!
this  is so FUCKING COOL
who's that ONE person who disliked??
ничего не понялнооченьинтереасна
Nice day, everyone!
This man deserve 10 million subscribers!! really
i cant wait for the wild west town...
Mans underrated af
wටᖺᗩ..ᖙᕰᖙᙓ ૪ටᕰ'ᖇᙓ ᓮᘉᗩᔕᘉᙓ
It sucks I don’t have the money for patreon
Why did he say “cobalstien”? Is that just a mispronunciation or an accent thing?
I can imagine how going from making buildings measured in hundreds of blocks to tens is interesting.
The church should be more rounded since smaller medieval villages didn’t get fancy gothic style churches but more romanesque style churches
But 4000 x 4000 is 16,000,000 blocks or am I dumb?
Trixy actually looks like David dobrik 2.0 with this cap, his hair and his black shirt
U should make a custom mod to go with the world like the villagers u can do something with them that can help with the story and can have quest
Make sure you add some massive caves
Dang
The builds are really amazing! Cant wait to see the wild west one, keep on working hard man! good luck with future builds
oml this looks incredible, and your process is always so satisfying to watch- Keep up the amazing work, hopefully we'll reach that like goal!
Just wondering is there like ores like diamonds and iron and like caves so if i would to play survival on it is it possible to get gear
I think it would be awsome if in the mosh room book eyou had a fungal cavern
amazing concept!! i'm totally hyped for what this map will look like when finished. :)
Bro you're the Minecraft Build God !!
could you try to create a bedrock edition download? your fans would thank you!
oh oh add like this huge cavern entrance on a side of the mountain which leads down to an underground settlements of the stoneage ppl or some hyperfuturistic ppl who hid their inventions from the outer world AND ESPECIALLY ADD MOON!
Amazing
An idea could be to have a dungeon that is as hard as you can make it and with awesome loot
Those 2 dislikes are people that thought the dislike button was the like button
can you please build a big  Elf tree in one of the biom and tree houses on it thanks
add bikini bottom near the ocean monument with the villagers as the different characters
OMG im really excited how this will end up!!! also, i cant wait for the download map:)
Imagine if minecraft world generation was actually like this
i’ve never downloaded one of his transformations before... but when this series is complete and the island is finished, i’m definitely gonna need this one for myself
who gave that one dislike? 🤣🤣
1 hour gang
Soooooooo cool Oscar really really nice job
You should also make a custom nether and end with custom biome edits
pogchamp         also put a giant ice worm
I can imagine this map as some sort of Dungeons and Dragons setting, its so cool
That island seriously reminds me of old school BIONICLE.
I really like what you did with the village! However, I believe you forgot the blacksmith as a profession building! That is quite an important one and one that would be really nice to make in your style ^^
do you plan on maxing out all the villagers with professions?
I feel like this will just be patron, even if it reaches the like goal. That is what happened last time
A temple or pyramid with traps would be cool
please make a steam punk town in the mountains
you are awesome
"I thought it would be interesting to make the clerics wandering traveler's who sell mysterious goods all across the map"  Wandering trader: *Sad useless Noises* Me to the wandering trader:" You know what you did!😡"
ELOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Very excited for this project and I know you already made the layout but how about the swamp biome though?
Long time no see.....!
You should make some data packs and resource packs for it so you can add some secret creature's and other little secrets thats not in game  :)
This is probably my favorite project so far, I love this idea. Do you think you could customize the nether biomes the same way in this world? That would take this to the next level
I don't want to complain because this is EPIC. But there should REALLY be a swamp and a tundra. Just think of all the cool stuff you could put in those two. And they don't have to be as big as the others, but they would be AWESOME. Voodoo and magic and willow trees in the swamp, along with countless secrets because lets be honest a swamp is a perfect place for secrets. The tundra can have Eskimos and hidden secrets frozen in the ice. It would be awesome!
CONGRATS ON A MILL AND BEYOND!! you ABSOLUTELY deserve it im always blown away by your dedication and creativity keep it  up man!!!
I honestly cant wait to play this Please get this video to 80k likes
Can you please do a bedrock version
Him: “and plains the most common biom”  Me who had to travel three hundred blocks to find one: No waaay!
Trixyblox making a map. Me: that's good  Trixyblox modifying the map. Me: it was shit at the beginning
Dis ril big
can't wait. That's a World i'd love to play.
Add the valentine saloon, called smithfields from rdr2 in the western town
Jesus loves you ❤️ :)
Esta padrisimo, te quedo increíble, quisiera poder jugar el mapa en survival, seria de lo mejor 😄😄
LIKE that shit i swear to god hahah
You should add some dark grey concrete in the snow biom to look like yeti foot prints
This looks like a fortnite map!
Damnn....
quest idea: make a journal that makes clues to take you towards the mushroom island but the village in the mushroom island moved but where and thats how that quest stars
5:50 if i was u... i probably would have "destroyed" the stairs a little too Like... some part broke into itself yk and theres a bunch of rocks at the side and u got like only one block brightnis to pass the stair ahead
You should add a villain in the snow biome
I would love to see a woodland mansion as well hidden inside the dark oak forest
This is one hell of a project. Looking forward to it's completion!!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
Please make sure to add ores everywhere realisticly in the underground, great project :)
YEA BOI
You know those water mushroom towers at water parks? Maybe put something like that on the mooshroom biome
Respect
I'd like to see maybe a Chinese themed area
You should make a huge wall a round the island and make it the goal of the map to gather resources from around the island and escape the wall
Can we geet 1 million likes for this video?  Trixyblox is underrated! :(
Nice build!
i need moreeeeee
Add secret ( not secret now) *Underground Kermit frog 🐸* temple
Heyyyy the hat is a nice look. Maybe get a custom one with your logo. :D
I just realised this came out 12 minutes ago I was looking at the likes then the time it came out to see if He had time to get 80k
Pls, i need map :) for mcpe :)
Crashed UFO in a glacier. Like in Ice Age
I would love to see the ocean expanded! I think you could do a cool Atlantis thing!
Wow, this looks like a HUGE undertaking, but I know you've got this! I can't wait to see the future biomes, and eventually, the finished map!
Go trixiblox
You should make a section of the mountain biome the ice spikes biome.
This is sick
AMAZING!!!!
This is the most amazing Minecraft video I have EVER SEEN! So glad I'm on your Patreon!
Make custom music play for each biome?
You should create a lore video for this world later this year or in between big projects. It would be nice to see all the little secrets from the maker and see your vision!
I've had this idea for the longest, greate to see someone doing it so well.
i was waiting for this moment
When the world needed Trixyblox most, he uploaded a video
please make this free
It would be so great if you make this map free to download 😀
9:42 *sad beetroot noises*
I just want to see a civilization living a a cave with paths connecting to each biome, I think it would be a cool map Hub with maybe a secret entrance or vault with treasure
there was no woodland mansion :( rip those un-rip items
You should include an abandoned dawarven city in the snowy mountain haha love your vids😊
You’re bad at being bad at building
do you get most of these constructions out of your head? is that the buildings are very detailed and beautiful, it’s surreal to think that it’s all in your head
Every single upload of urs gets me excited
The Bob Ross reference.  That is great!!   That made me really excited.  I constantly watch his videos.  Remember, there are only happy accidents.
This screams Wynncraft
How dont u burn out. I NEEED this type of commitment
I clicked faster than a grade school relationship
Can u do a pillaged castle for the next vid??
You should make a Pirate Cave. On the mushroom island you should carve out a hole that also had the ocean water going in so ships can sail in and out. The cave would just be Pirate stuff and parts of a broken ship. Use your imagination for the rest.
I think its great your taking breaks on the underwater world dont wear yourself out and enjoy yourself (Love the build btw)<3
Bruh this is amazing
Will you be able to get the map on bedrock?
tes pourri
is it just me or did I click on a zelda breath of the wild video
7 minutes  I am here I AM HERE AHHHHHHHHHHH
I cannot WAIT to play this map with my friends in a kind of factions like game. Good shit man, i will be watching diligently on your progress!
This is so cool !!!!!
I love all your builds you're so cool
Alt title: If minecraft was made by TrixyBlox
it would be really cool if the island originated from a giant animal, and the player has too figure out what kind of animal it was
Only 1 dislike I like that ratio
map Download ?
Pog your a god at building
Day 1 of asking you to transform lukethenotables 2000 day hard-core base
I been waiting so long I can't wait!
Definitely try to upgrade the nether
As soon as i saw the planning I didn’t need to be told this was from zelda botw favourite game btw
Love the vids!
Excited 😆😆😆
This totally needs to be added to the minecraft marketplace for console players either free or paid for, i'd happily pay just to explore this incredible map.
Poggers
Pls some Hytale references 😁
Maybe do a small section of the nether from the other side of the ruined portal with the notable nether biomes? If this does well, which I'm sure it will!!!
Imagine an ice mage/magician school hidden in the snowy mountains
And I get hyped when I finish a wheat farm
The best thing ever!!!!😁😁
Claim your medals here ⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇⬇
79th
I clicked so fast omg
I wish i could play this map but my laptop would probably blow up and open a portal into the nether
my boy had a glow up
Having a couple video game references would be fun to see. Like in the taiga or mountains have a Skyrim reference
Please get this to 80k. I need to play it haha
You can make a battle royale with this map
He dosent has those hairy things in eyes
I love your ideas Oscar
