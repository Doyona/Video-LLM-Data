Angus! Where is your #3 hat?
Or a 5.O
This is not a 350 camaro
Why are you working on this dodge?
18:45 😂😂😂
😂😂
28:00 I got shocked in the wiener
Mook having a drink and building a carb could only go well lol just joking
Rewatching this old video to have the context for the new video that just came out!
Bull house... more word of mouth than back road spotting, yup!
"At least the cats putting on a show"...thanks, I had to change my jeans cause I peed myself from laughing 😂😂😂
Does anyone know what happened to this truck? I’m still waiting for the Cummins swap😭🙏🏻
What a great name for a cat 😂that’s my last name 😂😂😂
Suggestion for empty trailer travelling: Use waterbags they should be easy to empty and stash once you have something on the trailer or even just used together with a light load.
Looks like a coffin
Quagmire laughing as Kevin tries to find the hole.
I like these kind if videos but your cursing god is to much for me
Nothing beats a buzzed Mook, rebuilding a carburetor.
If you wanna be a weaner about that carb, I'll take it off your hands
Mook cracks me up😂. She make's the show better. She definitely deserves a pay rise  good onya Mook✌️🇦🇺👍
I think we need more drunk mook 🤣🤣🤣 havnt laughed this hard in so long
Can i borrow your trailer? I just need to pick up some plywood. Ill have it back tomarrow. Meanwhile...
Why do all Mopar starters sound like dying dolphins it doesn't even matter if it's brand new and out of the box
I will never forget the first time I heard this song. I listened to Morphine from their first album, after Mark died I thought I would never hear anything new again, then I saw this album at a record store, I bought it immediately. I remember unwrapping the CD and popping into my cd player in my car and hearing the piano, it was like Mark was singing from the grave .
P.o.s. dodge not even fun to watch
I think this is the most that Kevin has ever farted on camera. Lol. Y'all make me laugh so hard. This is so entertaining and educational at the same time. I am so glad you two are together, you two were made for each other.
It's the hodge podge dodge.....lol.   I would just cut the ramp bed off and put it on a Chevy truck.
Not sure if Hobbs is big or Mook is small.
Great advice for cars finding , sux its not like that here in NZ , we have yuck humans scouring the country buying up every old vehicle boxing them up amd sending them to dubai or somwhere overseas
Love your spirit hard work thank you for the entertainment. Beings I watch other tube videos please safe guard  your equipment  because there are dishonest people out there  Put  Air Tags on  your lively hood.
Put you a Ford motor and transmission in it
Nope, I’ll stick to my forwards
You guys have way too much fun lol
Let’s not talk about Miss Missouri now lol
And 10 days later here in south Central Missouri it’s 12°
Looks like the brakes hanging up❤😅
I get it. Sometimes you need to let go. Drinky-dranky is not very good content.
man i wish he would of dun this thing up it was so cool
It was me - I sent the circuit tester!  From SE London!
I actually had second thoughts lighting up a cigarette whilst watching you trying to start this dodge
If the thermo quad has a plastic valve body and has a Crack in it the vacuum leaks will drive you nuts
Holy shit the Cock Shock had me LOSING IT hahahaha.
When is the next vid on this truck?
10:40 I’ve got an 09 Escalade and a 57 Buick. I never take the Escalade to buy a car.
Btw, the shifter needs all new bushings front to back, thats why the column shifter is so stiff! These bushings are nylon and pop in very quickly, the main one is the pivot point where the shift linkage bolts to the bellhousing , also clean and apply marine grease or silicone spray to these linkages then its like brand new! Done a billion of these on old chrysler products over the years bringing them back to life.
Just remember, theres 2 bands on a 727 transmission, drop the pan and look at both of them. They should have max 1/4" gap between the tip of the adjuster screw and the contact point on the band, once thats checked and corrected, there is the low and reverse band adjustment on the outside drivers side transmission case near the shift linkage, i cant remember the specs but you loosen the lock nut and turn it in at so many inch pounds then back it out a few turns then lock it down and boom ! Functioning transmission! Usually thats all they ever need untill the case wears out which is a billion miles of abuse or 2 seasons of drag racing behind a 1000 hp engine.💯👍🤜
Thermoquads are awesome! But its best to get a factory mopar manual that covers them, they do have weaknesses such as the main jet wells become unbonded from the phelonic material the main body is made from. These can be easily repaired with fuel proof epoxy and never have a problem again. Also the thermoquad is infinitely adjustable being that its a needle and seat style carb, for the primaries  theres a little flat head screw dead center of the airhorn that adjusts the fuel curve throughout the primary range, turning the screw in raises the needles to richen the primary circut, backing the screw out drops the needles and leans out primary flow. For the secondary theres a little spring you can adjust at the end of the air door shaft on the left hand side that adjusts when the secondaries open, tighten the spring for delayed opening, loosen it so they open early ( great for drag racing!)
This was interesting. As an American, I see a massive, high stakes game. One the US can't afford to lose. I believe Canada and the US can work in tandem to support each other. Americans don't want to take Canada.
Where's the ramp truck at
Worn-out car
Worn-out car
This video is 2 year old today:)
Call dalton pole barn garage
a way i know my buddy convinces alot of older folk to sell him the car, you tell em that they will be able to get a ride in it when its done and youll also send them updates and stuff. its not alot of persuading but even if they say no then, it sits with them and it will be on their mind. (he sends whoever pics and vids and has given a few rides to original owners a bunch)
Thermo junk fix is a need for a Holley or big AFB
Steering wheel sounded like a honeymoon in a cheap motel.
He did not just poke a wire
That Mopar tax! 👍🏻😅
Man that’s a cool truck
Probably cylinders dry from starting fuid
Its a 440 needs a litter to kick
poop!
0:04 that block looks like a Milwaukee M12 battery
0:04 that block looks like a Milwaukee M12 battery
yay Angus is in this one 🙂 you two are so bloody wholesome to watch & Mook too :-P Greetings from from Australia anyways & thanks for all the awesome videos :-)
You got yourself a keeper Kevin. I’ve tried to get my girlfriend to work on the snowmobiles and cars. She won’t have it.
i like the 78 grill in that old bird. pretty sweet looking old sled
My best day
I'm buying a boltster just cause of Mook spinning one on her finger.  Lol best commercial of all time.
oh geez,,, i didnt know you can get your weiner zapped when checking the coil and distributor... damn dude,,, little higher octave now when you sing in the shower...
46:35 can you stop popping 😂
Angus, a cummins swap is one of the easiest swaps on the planet😂 ❤ especially a 12v
@17:00 OMG. My buddy's family had two Dodge trucks that burned to the ground in the 80s. Never knew why, I do now.
Put an old slingshot dragster on it and park it as yard art. That would look cool
And I will scream thanks for the reminder
Funny farts but her face is priceless 😂
It’s because when you pull the wire away, the coil can build up a higher voltage before discharge
Everything's frozen
That thing is awesome.
I still would love to see a 12V Cummins swap in that thing.
Gearbox is rooted it's blown
The coil is shorting out badly
On that dodge truck theat spark problem you have is the coil change it to a new one and spark plug leads
Alcohol is the answer rubbing alcohol
You didn't put any junkyard digs stickers on your window
That's not the only thing that wiggles
Merry Christmas put the spark plugs in
I'm sorry what's tingling again
Just when you think it's not going to get any funnier it sure does
I've got the answer for blackberry Brandy
Almost a million people are laughing right now almost
I don't know maybe it's outside temperature related
What's the temperature in Tennessee just asking?
They don't sell those plugs anymore
Spend some money and put a real distributor in there
Astoria sounds like a sick dolphin
Driver side corner
Angus learn how to say just say no no no no no no no no no
I had a 77 w200, i got rid of that junk dodge ignition system and switched to a chevy HEI. The truck ran awesome after that
27:58 I've been there before 💀not fun
weak
Aahhh, drunken work time, fricken awesome..
Bro those thermoquad carbs on Ur big block ramp truck are pain in arse when left sitting for any amount of time....had probs with float stick over here in Australia where it's warm even..
My 04 Dodge ram has has similar problems! Some  things never change 😂.........
47:07 I love this bit😂 Mook: *drops cup* "Huh!! Someone dropped her water." *Laughs* Kevin: *wheezes*
Whatever happened to this Dodge Ramptruck? Are you ever going to revisit the Limo?
Are you selling that talk or is it already sold 0:28
I wouldn't trust this guy to fix a skateboard let alone my car
8:24 insert "How close i am to x" meme here holy shit 😂
I can’t wait to see that beaut come to Alberta! Steve will be hauling minty classics to my house with it in no time! Cheers from Canada guys!
6:24 trailer noises
I have the biggest crush on Mook. Too bad you're literally the perfect couple but if shit ever goes bad hmu. I got a whole stack of carbs for u to rebuild bby ❤
I think you're confusing the fire issue on Dodges with Fords...ive never heard of or seen these Dodges catching on fire because of their wiring...however every 1st gen Taurus burned to the ground...my uncle's burnt down in front of his house and he pulled up his chair and got his popcorn because he hated that piece of shit 😂😂. A woman even got accused of murduring her mom after she perished in her Taurus that caught fire...turned out the car self-ignited and the melted plastic falsely tested positive as accelerant.   Also, I've NEVER seen that 440 fender badge before. Fuckin sick. This is kind of a rare truck...Hopefully you're not just throwing that sweet 440 away when you Cummins swap ot...they haven't made 440s in over 40 years and good ones are harder to find as each day passes.
wait are mook and kevin together
Two videos back: wagon with no reverse. This video: truck with no drive. Seeing a theme here. 😄😄  Also:  Kevin: Have you told them about the screaming deal they can get, Mook? Mook: You can scream. You have free will. You wanna scream, go ahead!  Never stop, you guys. 😁😁
Isn't it the less useful truck ever built!?
Love seeing Mopar videos !
I'd love to see this truck return someday.
equalizer hitch might help the ride
Mooks hilarious    love her ❤❤❤❤❤
Sounds like rear-end gone to me. Had a ford do that, except it would go forward, but not reverse.
I found this truck back on Facebook marketplace not too long ago and in the description, they said it was on your channel, I came by to see if it was worth the $5000, my dream truck is an 85 - 93 w350 crew cab long bed dually, but this would be an awesome thing to own, especially since im building a Dakota pre-runner
Every Mopar they work on always comes to life like it's showing them Mopar is better than the other cars those motors are bullet proof if u take car of it and drive it like they are meant to be driven
Every Mopar they work on always comes to life like it's showing them Mopar is better than the other cars those motors are bullet proof if u take car of it and drive it like they are meant to be driven
Wonder if the breaks might be getting stuck on the drum breaks
What’s your plan for this now ??
It still has its cats... I'm dead😂
I hope u still have this truck id cab swap it with something else and throw a cummins in it with the nv5500 would be a sweet setup
Just a perfect couple
6:26 you're welcome.
I have a '76 Power Wagon and that big ole amp meter wire thingy almost toasted my pickup since it was run through the standard harness where the wiring goes into the cab. So I just bypassed it and I haven't had any issues. Interesting to know it was a consistent issue and not a fluke like I thought it was. Love the videos man.
Is there gonna be a soon on this, Cummins swap gonna be fun
I will be honest a lot of those and that mid 70 Dodge Chrysler in Plymouth had what was called a lindenberg ignition system in it I don't know if that one has it or not I couldn't really tell but if that's the case that's the reason why I didn't plugs will be followed by that all the time I had a 79 diplomat that way
Hi
I knew better than to think that was water.  The carb referb-a-build was very entertaining.
You can't get a drunk woman work on vehicles it don't work 😂
Did the Cummings swap ever take place?
Even though I’m a year late it’s a 1970
Mook should have an own Channel ! ILMAO!!!
That thing is equally awesome and terrifying!? I approve  Edit: And you guys are even funnier when tipsy! Who knew?
That transmission identifies as a rock tumbler
Was waiting for the whiskey spill, was not disappointed.
It starts like a mopar   they weren't any fun in the cold country
I need to move. Arguably some of the worse vehicles in the country up here in northern Michigan, can't find something running or not for less than 5 grand.
Hahahaha loved mooks carbatator build and Kevin soiling himself
really like Kev and Angus 2 super smart guys
That's ridiculous. I just see myself in  the garage after couple of drinks trying to fix something 😂. Is not fast but is funny. I need a Mook
A friend of mine used to have a Prius that ran off a lawnmower battery and was missing a belt for a short time. Miraculously the car still drives i do not understand how.
must be a dodge thing, i bought a 97 2500 for $500 and she didn't run, was told it was the crank sensor, replaced it, nothing, sparkplugs , nothing, distributor cap and rotor, nothing, and then my dumb ass decided to look down and I said "maybe its the coil" $35 later, she started like a champ... then a u joint busted on the front drive shaft, replaced it, then snapped a bolt on the yoke, took shaft off and am replacing yoke and shaft, then it started spewing coolant, and then i went and got a thermostat, housing, upper hose and lower hose, then when taking out the thermostat, the bolt busted on the housing.... i swear she doesn't want to be fixed but she doesnt get a choice lol
I'm a old mopar man and I'm telling ya every time ya run your 727 trans let it run in neutral for 10-15 seconds before ya hit reverse or drive
Mook is a fkn riot! Man you are lucky to find someone like her brother 43:25
I came across your channel a few days ago and since then I have probably watched about 20 hrs worth of videos.  Keep up the good work, also I love the dynamic and chemistry between you and your wife.  I wish I could get my wife out in the garage but she has no interest.
I found this on market place a week ago
That thing is a bonfire waiting to happen! Cut your losses Kevin, it's Farked.
I want to buy it
Heres to hoping we get to see a Cummins swap to this truck in 2024
That truck has the high output alternator, 100A
That should be a crime to put a Cummins in a classic big block truck like that.
cummins ?  heellll no,  this thing wants its big block for sure
I can't find part two to this
ahhh, the carter thermo-quad carb... the only Carb that was designed to punish you for going full throttle.
The flex plate is complete toast
Не видел еще ни одной машины с инжектором, которые вы запускаете в полет
At least the cat is putting on a show. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 Mook is the queen of observational comedy. 😅
I’ve seen this before on small engines
The system wants more resistance.
Champion plugs suck
When trailer is empty,,put farm weights on the trailer
Im a year late to this party, for some reason i dont remember this episode. Once i seen the ramp truck move i was thinking...tighten the band adjustment, either by feel or read a book, either way that would probably be enough to send er down the road. Wont last long most likely but yeah, that band adjustment gets overlooked too often. It helps take up the slack in the band to drum clearance. IIRC the drum spins in first, then the band clamps the drum and stops it from turning for 2nd, then 3rd it's released again....i think. Since it finally did move on its own off idle in 2st i believe its safe to say band adjust. Honestly, a torqueflight is a relatively easy trans to rebuild. You ought to give it a try sometime and make a vid out of it. You will pat yourself on the back so much you'll run out of breath! This is true for all y'all out there, give it a try at home if you got a torqueflight that needs a rebuild.
I was hoping someone would mention the 8-Track player.
Would you sell the ramp truck?
Old mechanics trick is to just set the plug wires on the plug, not seated but allow a gap between the plug and the wire for a hotter spark... works great on 2 stroke engines that like to foul.
I would think an Iowa boy like you would ALWAYS take the back roads
Sometimes I can't tell if Mook is 13 or 30 😂
Once a dodge always a dodge
I the late 60s to early 70s I ran a Plymouth Valiant. When you’re trying to start this truck,  it sound the same as when I tried to start my valiant. Whine crank whine crank lol
Was this thing in WI?
Jesus Loves you He died on the cross for your sins and if you repent if your sins and confess with your mouth His is Lord and son of God you are saved. God bless 😊😊😊
@ 1 min it says 440 on the fender. 😂
She's so cute
It’s for sale on marketplace right now
Why is the back of the truck like a ramp?
This truck is the epitome of a massive project.
Any updates on this rig?
$3500 is more than its worth. That's including double Mopar tax
I got an idea, put a transmission in it!
Love Mook x
How can I find info on buying this truck?
Kevin is a redneck Ricky from trailer park boys
I see this truck on Facebook marketplace
Safety First  Excellent
the 1970s were over 40 years ago
Are you sure the bed to talk about Missouri because I live in the Alan Missouri
Crown Royal apple is delicious.
SOUNDS LIKE THE REAR ENDS BLOWN  OUT...
EVER SEEN OIL IN SUB FREEZING COLD.....MAKES..HONEY.  LOOKLIKE  ACETONE....
white smoke, modulator valve on transmission
KEEP IT GAS MAN
Idk about you but I need that radio and speaker system and glovebox for my 1978 dodge w400
BRUH THAT TRANSMISSION IS GRENADE YOU’RE LITERALLY GRINDING WHATS LEFT OF IT
Hobbs is gorgeous.  Need i say more.
Great video Jack, keep up the awesome content, you should do square body give away
Usually behind the horn cap you could always find the joint 420
I would buy a big roll back haul that shit on instead of dragging a trailer ever where
I’m in need of door panels for 78 bronco 13:04
You and moog are the Iowa version of chip and jhoana gains from texas!
I never realized there were so many ways to spell carburetor😂
I love mook need to have her in more videos
Slow cranking, weak battery. The fuel in the truck is yellow, how long has it sat? The park pawl is in the trans,in thev tail shaft housing.
My dad got a Chevrolet ramp truck today but it needs repairs
Mook's resting stance @11:48 is perfection itself. You need to do a t shirt with that on lol
I will it
Fyi. 60's ford trucks with the optional ammeter and oil pressure gauges also wired like the dodge..  Wont start if the ammeter isnt connected or bypassed..
To restore that, it would take so much money to completely replace the transmission that I don’t think you’ll get very many “offers” for it. There’s a good chance that, many years ago, the transmission completely BLEW!!! If that’s the case, that old vehicle was permanently parked and headed for the salvage yard as the cost of fixing it would have been astronomical. When the transmission blows to pieces like that,  it’s what’s called a “technical total.” It’s one thing if it were a family camper, pickup truck or station wagon that you could take trips in, but this is a "car hauler." It does have value as a “collector’s item”,  but not much value beyond that. With that said, the engine has a  LOT  of good, highly sought after parts that may be hard to find. This makes it a parts  “gold mine.”  Somebody might want an “original” Dodge starter. Anybody could see the  “gold mine”  of hard to find  PARTS  you have sitting there,  and much of it is in  PRISTINE  condition.  Oh I'm sure you could probably replace the transmission. But it probably wouldn't be worth the cost.
Nobody here gave those old Pontiacs any credit I'm almost more impressed they started and moved lol
Never rebuild a carb while drunk. Mook is so cute when she's drunk, though 😂.
I will take It
MY MOM & HER BROTHERS AND SISTERS THEY WOULD DRINK MILK STRAIGHT FROM THE COW IT DID NOT KILL THEM THEY WERE 66 YEARS OLD OR OLDER
If Tran y wasn't burnt jt is now
If ya think your gonna get 3500 your on  crack.
53:00 there's 900 cui of engine sat in that frame
The coil is jumping fire because you have some of the plugwires pulled, the spark has no where to go.
This time on Mook Rebuilds....Kevin s**t yer pants somewhere else and on your own time.
P I'm pretty sure that was spraning water 👍👍
Dude you make some pretty awesome videos you make pole barn the book bag😂😂😂😂😂
DARN UGLIEST TRUCK DESIGN!!!
did you check the vin on the frame
I love Mook
Sounds sound now
Bro they are yelling at you because it Drys out the Rings on the Pistons!!!  You can damage an engine that's been sitting by Using brake cleaner Notice the Noise and if the rings don't work then there is no compression and then it will not provide any horsepower and run like crap!!!
My grandpa had a truck just like that and now my dad has it and we go find barn finds and we put it on the flatbed tow truck
I believe I know the property that y’all bought my friend in high school used to live there and we would have airsoft wars
better if you leave 440 in...
Have run across any chevy vegas
Just slap a turbo diesel in it and call it a day 😂
That's water abuse 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I just found this on market place, to bad I don't have the cash to buy it or a place to put it
This was the best one you've you've do long time
Please start drinking bottled water instead of what comes out of the tap over there
What happened to Angus
I stand to be corrected Wilkes not it's just milk
This is the best one I've seen so far Lucas now trunk wonderful
Almost a fire but not so but then they have it did start
What's your name was a fire
There is nobody yelling we're just quietly
This is so much a classic it's worth watching
What is plan b
Way2go
Another reason why not to buy a Dodge
Tools have arrived
Big difference when he have to do an engine swap on a diesel than on a 454 there's a lot to go into avocation parts switch takes a lot of time and money
Accident to happen no stress there
How much does this rolling trailer weigh
I was referring to your trailer
Such a deal such a find
This particular case would you call this a feel fine instead of a barn find or a full revival episode
today on junkyard digs we revived a dead person
I Would put that cummins in a old crew cab ford vs that truck its rusty crusty and its a dodge there where no good when they where brand new
Best video EVER. Mook was just funny as hell. Would love to hangout with you 2. Hope I get the chance one day.
i should be sleeping but im watching your videos instead even though the car i want to work on is like 20 miles away and i cant even drive. cart before the horse i guess.
Wth? 28:59
Correction: Reverse and third gear are on the same set of clutches (bands ).
I can smell that starter through my screen.
What happened to this ????
When you two get around to having kids, oh my god yes they going to be good looking and smart. But also think it/they will be belchy, farty things 😂😂😊
Looked Like she Mookie had fun rebuilding the carb.  how many beers did she have.  lol
Great patience I would walked away from that roach after hearing that thing gasping to start lol
I love Mook doing "Drunk History" of Holley carbs.
If your mopar expert ever needs dodge stuff ,,, my brother in Mississippi has all kinds of dodge projects but mostly trucks
Man I love how there's something of interest for everyone in these videos. I have not seen a wide front end Allis Chalmers WD-45 since I was a child. My father had one in the early 80's. Thanks for a great video!
Did you find the first Bluetooth spark plug ?!?!
13:14 I have the High ground.
The part where he got shocked in the dick was just hilarious. I was ready for that 😂😂
28:30 same strange phenomenous on my Ducati! When plugs became too carbonized, they stop sparking until you don't "disconnect the cable a bit".
41:34 WTF IS SHE DRUNK????
Bro is towing a tow truck in a trailer and it doesn't fit then also he scrached the paint for IDK nice i like your content
You ask about something to fix the trailer beating you up when its empty.  If you can let off the throttle and it goes away, axle wrap is a concern, track bars usually help there.  If letting off doesnt change it, then heavier shocks, at the expense of ride.
Rebuilt many 4 barrel carbs back in the 70s and 80s. Holden used the Thermoquad on their 308 v8. All my Ford v8 Cleveland and Windsor were fitted with various Holley carbs.
You and Angus have engineering degrees? OMG the rest of us mortals are f***ed! 😁
Drunk Mook is same as normal mook😂
Carb rebuilt was hilarious!
@JunkyardDigs when is the next video on this car
Do you guys have a 440 lying around you wanna sell? My 68 300 was apparently changed to a 400 sometime in the 70s but I was told it had a 440. So I'd like to put one back in.
Love these older trucks so much.  Had a 77 F150 Ranger for many years but had to sell it because I didn't have the skills to keep that stupid 351m running.  🤬
More mook
Champion spark plugs are crap I will never use them I use NGK plugs
Guy really bought a car from the first mission in GTA V
Im more amazed the mice/rats havent ate all the wires more than anything.
Love them old dodge crew cab trucks when trucks were trucks  and men bought them and use them for big crews
My late father was on the board of directors of Cummins Engine Company.
I thought I was the only car addict that enjoyed driving around looking for cars.
Mook makes the show! She's hilarious! 🤣😂🤣😂
ABSOLUTELY, especially if it's a little 318!
Why on God's earth would you swap a 440 BB for a POS Cummins. (not that Cummins is a bad engine, BUT THAT IS A CHRYSLER BIG BLOCK YOU DON"T NEED A DIESEL)
Are you and moke married
Those thermoquads work pretty good if you know how to rebuild and set them up i rebuilt my first one last year on a 73 440 and after some fine tuning/trial & error i got it running and working good
That thing is still in pretty good shape gotta love an old dodge with a big block in it
am i nuts or is he grounding the plug to plastic
Trans needs a rebuild
Ew I heard that
Is that a faggrajet omg dude rebuild the CTQ
That carb has to go the inlet pendulum is stuck that's why it overflowing fuel like a toilet bowl
I love the CTQ their better than Edelbrock
Seeing mook drunk is 😂😂😂😂
gran rescate
Mook “You said moron” lol :)
727 trans is common and easy to find for that truck
I always thought either had more flamabilities than brake clean. But we didn’t always have either in the shop.
12 valve, to adapter plate, to whatever you got laying around, can make your vision come to life
The diagnostic connector was a thing for dodges. That old doege was loaded with ac, cruise! Fancy!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH sorry had to exercise my free will
I love chevy engine like 732ci big block ohh I can’t 💔
i have a caprice with a bad starter that kept cutting off power to the dash and ecm from time to time so i replaced it and alot of problems were solved and then replaced ignition module and stupid opti spark and the coil ( ignition module is famous for breaking down alot have a couple in your glovebox just incase)  ac works ,...everything else work even the electric fans ( car has over 750 000 kilometers on it , about 466 thousand miles ) and rebuilt the transmission
Give that thang an engine swap, the engines? I’d say swap the engine with a Duramax or 24 valve Cummins
31:51 Did it Spin backwards???
This truck is awesome :)  just as your other trucks you have bought :) And those cats are super cute :)
Ya I gotta say the bronco and other old fords..get em save em if u wernt so far away love to have bronco or 4x4 maroon ford
25:24 just listen to his words very carefully
Put that other one on YouTube we wish to see it.
i been wanting a ramp truck
The best!
The tranny isn't bad to rebuild they aren't as scary as they look :)❤❤
A lot of people don't know you have to check most dodge trannys when they are runnin
Champion plugs are for your Briggs and Stratton  mowers 😂
Bluetooth spark plugs
Plastic carbs are not going to be good ground
One of the best "JYD" videos ever!
Sir farts a lot (hey we guys have to stink - I mean stick together) have a challenge for you to repair that I have not seen you do yet. I am working (or should I say I hired a mechanic to repair since it was out of my area of expertise) I would love to see you take on a RV (1985 to 2003) built on a Chevy P-30 chassis (might still be on the work horse but mine is not)  parking break. Why? Well the parking break IS NOT on the wheels! Yep they chose to put it directly BEHIND the transmission on what looks and works just like a regular wheel brake but holds the drive shaft instead. My coach is 2999 WINNEBAGO 40 footer and very much like this DODGE there are 3 drive lines and you have to drop at least 2 of them to get the yoke loose. Now that will let your viewers hear words that even make a sailor blush. Then you have to get the yoke off the drum OR pull the drum AND the break drum together as unit using a front crank puller. That would be fun and actually very helpful for all us folks that have the P-30, P-40 and work horse chassis so they can see why it costs a fortune to have a dealer fix, especially if you are away from home and on the road. Thanks for the videos of you and you boss (MOOK) fixing things.
Hey Kevin. Do u need eyes on the ground in NW Indiana/Chicagoland?
What year is that truck
Mooks name is Ashley
Are we getting bombed? *The spy pigeon in the tree next to them, "Oh they know! THEY KNOW! RETREAT!"*
that was not water
champion suckssssss
Found this channel by happy YT accident, and was enjoying the video like any normal car vid until the "I got shocked in the wiener" followed by "oh no did it happen again", where I ugly laughed in farm kid for a good five minutes. I think it's kind of a rite of passage to experiment and get shocked (or burned a little, or cut) while you work on equipment- the key is to be able to laugh and tell the tale.  New sub, thanks for the fun videos and a great comment section! Oh, yeah, and the Raycon discount, because they have been a long time favourite of mine while working because they don't fall out while I'm doing my "monkey with a math problem" head tilts. :)
49:30
Wow, an old ramp truck that's NOT a Chevy?!? Awesome!
He couldn't get it in the hole...my Dad always said "Spit on it and keep pushing! It'll get in there!" Back in the day, Champion spark plugs were "the shit"...now they're just "shit"! Only place I'd use them is MAYBE in my lawn mower! As good as the whole video is,  "Drunk Mook" is the best part! Her nose was red, like a drunk in an old cartoon!
Restore itttt. Full frame up with a car on the back
Way Kool
I wonder if that ignition system is expecting resistor plugs, and isn't producing a strong-enough spark with conventionals.
Bluetooth spark plugs?
Somebody has probably commented this already but if there's no air in those rear air brakes, in my experience, it's easier to move them in reverse than forwards, I wonder if that's the bigger problem.
49:40 ngl thats what I sound like when I get drunk
It's going to happen again and agian meow pause and again 😂. A wiskey Mook a farting Kev the  corborator flew away hey how much fun it is to ride a rusty Chevrolet/dodge.
Strange world, lot of smells. Wise words.
My 440s HATE COLD WEATHER.
some ramps would do the job
Ive watched this 3 or 4 times.  I absolutely love this truck!  I wanna own it
what is the pretty car in background? 23:40  the station...
20:05  my ex plymouth satelite 73 had electronic ignition, too. original. it was chrysler technic like dodge.
old cars nevrt die 😳👏💯👍
Tom answer Kevin's question, the Jetts are "dance fighting" the Sharks.  There is the worst joke ever made with a metro-sexual referencing.
Looks like it needs a transmission overhaul
I don't get it Mooks water broke and your buddy had a kid the next day lol.
I'm sorry Kevin from another Kevin, I love Mook!
I love the sound an old Mopar make when it's starting up. Reminds me of my childhood and my dads 74 Prospector with the 360 in it.
Where are the 2 piece rooms at I heard him talking about the back is 2 piece because it's 2 rims
Any 2wd nv5600 nv4500 will work for what your trying to do  the bell housing’s are the same from 90-2007   If the 12v was pulled from a dodge or ford truck
Did I hear correctly? You are getting a new van!? I attempted to send you a link to a quality replacement van suggested by Yours truly but apparently that is frowned upon in Youtube land! Ready for this suggestion!!?? Its the Mutt Cuts Sheepdog van from Dumb and Dumber currently listed for sale on eBAY!!😊 Camper is so darn lucky!! Also, I thought I was the only person on this planet who randomly busted out in different accents! 😂 1942!!!?? Crikey!!
Nice little 1gen
Petition to re-name the episode "A feral Mook rebuilds a carb"
Ok Kevin hear me out: 12 valve cummins swap 5 inch straight pipe  10 in tip Coal rolling tuning Equals= the ultimate ramper special!
JYD and JYM your cats are adorable especially the orange cat.
Any update on this yet
Turns out rocco chiero lived until 2019. He was a Chicago truck driver by day, custom car builder as a hobby. Made incredible custom cars and either used or created your truck. Sounded like an interesting character to have known.
The dynamic duo :) Great vid. Keep them comin' !
MOOK OMG  you are one funny person  loved the carb build  with 2 waters
Do you still have it or did it get sold?
How you guys are when working is how I want me and my gf to be when working. A beatiful mix of seriousness and humor. Its awesome!
Hey Kev, you happened to mentioned the Bronco. We ever gonna see it again?
Go get that couger please!!!
Can we have drunk carb rebuilds every episode?
Diesel swap is stupid. Put a twin turbo big block in it and get better fuel mileage and way more interesting
I remember as a little kid my grandpa had an '82 Dodge dually with a 440, it was a beast but HOLY SHIT did it drink gas
You prob can find a standard dodge transmission from this base truck model that fits really easy on backroads and you get a free frame and body and engine with it. Just aim for a dodge with the same cab and engine:)
“Strange world, lotta smells” is now my favorite Mookism
like i said in my email i would love to be in one of your videos i dont care if its this channal or mooks i just want to do a video with yall
This guy gives off a ricky from TPB vibe and i love it 😂
This is an awesome truck, I had to subscribe when I seen this video. I never seen any other by you yet but since your from Iowa I had to follow lol. Council Bluffs Iowa over here.
You MUST save that Cougar next!!!
I would love to see you really get this thing running and driving around
I’ll trade my 1954 Ford Mainline 4 door for that truck. My ford has a 302, new brakes, new tires, new rear end 9inch, drive line. It really needs hardly anything. Starter went out along with the solenoid. And auto fan relay. It’s rusty but it’s cool.
These old ramp trucks are my favorite you definitely have to swap and restore it to working order!
I would love to come hang out with you guys sometime, Im in Cedar Rapids. Never quit, love everything you do!
Tell me your secrets " 😂🤣
Drunk Mook is the funniest thing and a farting Kevin makes it better
I've seen some people Double up 2 12v batteries for a 24v when the engine is moving too slow don't know if that's good for the starter or not but could be a good idea next time
I gotta say you're very lucky to have a woman like that

"thermoquad, the only carb to punishes you for going full throttle" - David Freiburger
Now why do you have a cummins laying around that we don’t know about!
try contacting  Adventures Made From Scratch  YouTube channel for potential parts?
Contact Mason's towing in Iowa Falls.  My Uncle used to own Boothill Auto in Iowa Falls and we sold it all to him.   Pretty sure there are number of dodge truck in that era out there still.
Try using a warmer lighting setting and use something to diffuse the light. I'm cheap and often use hyvee bags over the lights but it actually works ok.
I do gas station fuel tank system inspections (mostly Casey's lol) I get to drive the backroads of Iowa, Illinois, Missouri and Wisconsin all day and see so freakin many old cars and trucks it's crazy.
Good running motor ? 😂
Reminds me of Don Garlits' rig from the 70s !!!
I wanna buy that truck 4500 quid
would love to see the inside of this gearbox. what in there failed exactly.
Plug  gap is off and ballast resistor  needs replaced and like coil  lol oops you found it electronic ignition  control box is that square unit by the hood hinge
Many will disagree but automated plugs are the best in early mopars.
Yo Junkyard Digs, do you have a set of 4 GM bullet hole rims? They came on the 1st Gen Chevy S10/S10 Blazer and GMC variants, as well as standard on the S10 Baja. I live in Iowa and either nobody has them, or they're on someone's truck and they don't want to sell them.
6:26 great sound affects Kev.
He had the Bluetooth spark plugs that dodge offered in 1977-81
You should keep it, and rebuild the Auto trans. A difficult but interesting job. and the 727 is super simple inside.
Gosh man 20m i think we stole the crown
I sent an email about a lead on NV4500s. Kinda sorta local. Keep an eye out for it. Subject is something like "NV4500s for RAMp truck"
i really thought this was a game😂😂😂
Missouri gets pretty damn cold as well.
mook was WAY TOO DRUNK to build a carb lmao
I just want one whole episode of Mook just drunk. Don't care what she is doing. But the entertainment level is beyond 1000.
i think the spark plug thing was because the ceramic on the plugs was not resistant enough for the voltage, so the spark just shorted to the vice through the ceramic. i saw it happen on a lawn mower once. coated the ceramic in silicone and it worked great
Kevin, I thought I saw a little bit spark hitting the carb.  But I am not sure.
ithink the noise is maybe starter bendix no back so run with engine together.
I need that 67 cougar. Send me gps coords?
Yup its very cold big block with a gear reduction starter they don't turn over real fast in warm weather so good luck man I'm rooting for you to get her started
46:04 the way mook lifted up her side like that she's the one that rooted for sure ....love ya mookster!!! And she looked rite at the camera ......lmfao
Farmers always have old cars
It worked and yes kids remember this and try at home
I know that's what she said but that's huge
Truck looks like something from circus, but bless you and your friends and your good heart man, god bless.
Sounded like he was motorboating. Amazing truck
Spark jumping to ground on spark plug is definitely cracked insulators..
This Is fricken sweet lol .awesome.
Step 1, put the thermoquad back on. They're too cool to throw in the trash.   Step 2, salvage the big block  Step 3, salvage anything useful off the ramp truck, then scrap it  Step 4, Big block in a Duster, Dart, Barracuda, or similar sized mopar
Love that truck.
Looking up Rocco and seeing his custom work, it’s no wonder why nothing on the ramp truck matches lol
Great shows keep up the good work great truck
I've watched your videos in the past.😶
had me laughing pretty good when you were checking for spark.  Sorry that Im laughing at your expense.  How long have you been doing vids?
The truck next to it looks much cooler ngl
I like watching junk yard diggs but man his girl is fucking numb.childish nd keep her out of ur vids.much better vids w out mook..sorry but she really needs to go pound sand..
Why waste all that time trying to get it to run when you're gonna take it out and swap it? I imagine you're gonna rebuild once you take it out.
If you hate Dodge so much then why did you bother buying it I'd rather push that Dodge than drive a Ford
2 engineers + a mook...there are no limits!
what happened to the green Mastang
Red line it! 🤣
I’m more interested in the red 50’s model truck next to it
30:07  one of the very few times I literally laughed out loud.  sorry it was at your expense
Get ahold of Finnigan from Finnigans Garage he has a similar tow truck
Im 49 yrs old livin in sw pa and ive only seen one dodge 440 magnum engine,and i worked at an alternator,starter shop in the 90s.i'll bet the engine is worth a good bit of money.
WE LOVE MOOK SHOWS SO MUCH PLEASE DO THE MOOK SHOWS BIG LONG FAN OF BOTH OF USE FROM NEW ZEALAND
This is an amazing truck. You should restore it and put a flat bed on it
Definitely put a 12V in it
The truck sounds like it’s laughing at you
Dylan is getting a new truck I guess.
No way it stat THERE for 27 years!!! No wayyyyyyy that paint would look that good for 27 years in an open field!!!! I’d say 26 of it has been under a barn!!!🤣🤣
What did you pay for that if you do not mind me asking
We need a dedicated channel for un-cut drunk carb rebuilds
Of course it'll start... it's a mopar
14:48 "Get in, loser, we're fixing the Ramp Truck"
How many more YouTubers are going to find this same truck.. Didnt vicegrip Garage find this also?
Did you check the e-brake? Those drums and calipers are probably frozen. They do that when they sit not to mention you can only go in reverse (A good sign the brakes are stuck).
I didn't know it was a Dodge until 17:00
47:16 had me dying lmfao
My favorite video because of the blublublu
That dodge is huge and a beast! You two drinking is funny!😅 cracking me up!! That carb is big!!
I love this guy
Are those solid core spark plug wires?
Do you need any 77 Mercury cougar parts? I have an fmx 3 speed auto. Still in car.
Spark plug cracked porcelain most likely. I've seen this multiple times.
My wife sent the Raycons threw a hole washer dryer cycle, and they survived!
It's funny because when you were loading it up I was thinking "That's the most Dylan McCool truck they've ever done on here!" and then you called him lol too bad the project didn't go your way that thing is cool but maybe the next owner can bring her back to life!
lil tipsy time on carb. man i laughed so hard i fell out of my chair. its been a rough last few weeks. i neeeded a good laugh. thanks for that. but that old ramper would be neat to see a cummins swap.  time will tell
you already stole it
Boom boom boom
I got to ask you that bull is in a mixing bowl or is it a cooking bowl or is it just a plain ordinary bolt for putting gas in
Is that a suppressor wire?
Were getting bombed
Omg I was looking at buying this truck on Facebook marketplace but it was to far away from me I'm happy to see it goes to an awesome home
For ‘70’s Dodge truck questions, reach out to Retro Auto - MN.   Very knowledgeable and just north of you guys.   Hope that helps!  From what you have shown in this vid, that thing looks like quite the hodge podge Dodge.  Overall pretty cool find.  Thanks for the videos all!
That thing looks super cool
Bad Coil
That\s a nice truck . Just throw this poc engine out and shoehorn a diesel instead ... Good luck :))
See the problem in the side of the plug. It's a champion. That is junk
Dont drink and rebuild carbs
The last 10 mins of this video are comedy gold.
Just ordered the swag pack! Love y’all content and your channel is what inspired me to get back into my hobbies focusing on vehicles.   Still saving to get the camera and mic you recommend a while back through email but hey it’s progress!!!
Thet spark plug sparking only over a gap means the spark plug is dirty and it forms a conductive path that carries away the small current from the coil. If you form a gap, there is no leak anymore, the small coil current is sufficient to charge the capacitance of the wire to the high voltage till the spark forms. The spark then acts like a very good switch, discharging the cable capacitance into the spark plug. And because now it is coming from a capacitance, the current is not limited anymore, so it can overcome the dirt leakage, so build enough voltage across the spark gap electrodes to form the spark there too. As far a I know, some spark plugs had an extra spark gap (or a piece of ceramics electrically behaving the same way) inside the ceramic insulator for exactly the same - to help the sparks to form even when electrodes are dirty. But not sure if all spark plugs have that and even when it is there, it uses to be the first thing to fail on the spark plugs that have this extra feature.
very nice video
Truly great job on this content
Good
Awesome video
Had a Ram Charger there was a sensor on the firewall that would fail leave you dead in the water
It would be a better truck if you took that cab and put it on a second gen Dodge cab and chassis frame that already has a Cummins in it. You could lengthen the newer truck frame to the correct length with pieces from the old frame and then add to it to strengthen it. The benefits are numerous......bigger rear axle and heavier springs. Diesel tank and lines already installed, wiring that matches the engine all there for use in the older truck cab. Larger brakes and hydraboost if you  get the right year of second gen truck (97).
Don't forget the ceramic register on the firewall!
Good day :) You probably have bad wires. I had a RV with 440 in it and had the same problem. Wait till it gets dark and turn it over, you will see a spider web of lightning going everywhere. Try new plug wires. :) Thank you for your videos :)
DUDE, I CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE PLANNED CUMMINS SWAP!!
Nice
I'd take that 440 off you if you ever pull it
Don’t trash the 440 rebuild that thing they can make some power
One drive shaft will be for the PTO which will drive the tilt and winch. Well at least that’s what most trucks have
Hey january 10 is my dirthday
Drunk Kevin and Mook messing around is so hilarious. Mook freaking out after every small thing- lol
Sell it to Dylan
Old cars don't die, they just go to Iowa.
You should always pour an eggcup of fuel down a carb with these long dead cars. As the carb may be empty it cannot pass the spray of fuel necessary especially on a cold day. But an eggcup full will slowly atomise and give a better chance of starting.
Drunk carb repair is the best! Lol
Rebuild the transmission to get it moving
Dylan’s new project???
I would love for this to be the project pickerupper this would be an awesome slow restore
There is my Whiskey sipping Dream woman. 😂...Sorry not sorry.
The drunk part is hilarious
Thumbs up
Very good video
That truck has been sitting a couple years max
Kevin, fellow Iowan, I SO feel your pain with the trailers on the roads in Iowa. Even when I have my hitch carrier on my truck we’re a shaken down the road. Great video as always!
mook is the funniest ever LMFAOOOOOOO
Bit late but from what I’ve heard the amp meter is not what lights the car on fire. The problem is the bulkhead connector so run a wire through the Speedometer  cable hole to the amp meter.
I had an orange tabby years ago Wish I’d thought to name him Hobbes too Calvin and Hobbes has always been my favorite comics series
I love Angus, he's so comical. The 2 of you together are becoming an iconic duo
If it has air brakes and truck brake chambers it will need air to release the spring brake if they can stop a 15l cummings that 440 don't stand a chance of turning set spring brakes
I think the slow turning might be some seriously high compression
Dodge eletrical diseases are real it took out spark plugs what's next Edit ballast resistor nice knowing you

34:29 i could smell that startup
That's a good old Dodge I would keep it and bring it back to life !
Maybe the u joints are binding ?
Make sure none of your brakes are stuck ?
Did you check to see if theirs oil in the differential ?
I have seen old Mopar transmission just a clogged filter !
Try some Lucas transmission fluid,did you ever check the transmission fluid ? LOL
Maybe the clutches or gone ,jc Whitney has good rebuild kit parts
Old Moparts are a few bux !
Put some oll in the cylinder s so you don't wash the walls !
If mechanical fuel pump make sure the diaphragm doesn't leak fuel in your oil internally !
Make sure the gas tank isn't full of rust and bad gas and cracked old fuel hoses !
Put some Lucas in the engine and transmission !
Last time I heard a big block Mopar tick that bad I blew up my 400 LOL 😂
How much world you be willing to let her go for I’ll take it off yer hands
Worst Transmission ever made is in that truck know to explode!!
I found an very abandoned subaru brat that had the same spark jumping around the coil. I think new wires did it
Mook's sense of humour sends me every time. How does someone come up with "strange world, lotta smells" on the fly like that
Put a Cummins in it and it will be a aaaaaaawsome truck 😊👍🏼❤️ Gasoline is for Ladyboys! Diesel is for men haha
Bought one of these bad boys in the holler of Virginia when I first got my license, paid 900$ and it ran I'm pretty sure its still sitting out back somewhere been sitting close to 10 years if its still back there
I havent finished video yet, and i still want more of it. Im clueless european, and sight of big, rusty orange and loud truck is absolutely addicting
THERMOQUAAAD. Steve Dulcich would be proud.
Did Mook say  "Strange world, lots of smells"  that is hilarious. That is t-shirt worthy.
What kind of test light is that?
IS YOUR TEST LIGHT MADE OF A BULLET
17:23 as soon as I knew they were working on a dodge, I knew Dylan McCool was gonna show up somewhere lol
"it's very...(1000 yard stare)........unique"
would love to see a Cummins swap
It didn't like that yucky break clean which is a true sign its a gas pig.
People watching in December 2022
👍
😁
Lol, best carb rebuild ever!
If it where me I would restore the paint and decals and build it o and fix the sleepers so you have a place to sleep when Mook kick's you out the house 🤣🤣🤣
Oh God this video was funny. All these dodge stereotypes coming to fruition. Sick rig though 😂
Stay for the carburetor section lmao
Just put a eaton fuller in her
There is an fj80 landcruiser around the corner from me, i think imma use my tax money on it
I want the truck next to it
Bad ass truck
Do you realize your trying to ground the plug on the oem carb that’s got a plastic main body so not good best ground thru the carbs linkage etc.
THERMOQUAD
fyi champion plugs are garbage .... have been for a very long time .... i have just used ngk same price way better plug
Put an Allison transmission behind the Cummins with a transmission controller
Hey Kevin, another entertaining and informative video as usual. I myself would love to know more about the dodges as well. Also, that 77 plow truck back there. Do you ever actually use that thing or do you just let it sit there as punishment for the struggles it caused you? That video was very funny to me watching you fight with that thing while also being helpful as I own a 75 f250 that's been giving me some grief.
I wish you were closer cause I’ve got a 73 f350 ramp truck I’m in the process of getting back on the road
I've never had a problem with Chrysler electronic ignition, the module on my car came out of a junkyard 20 years ago and still works just fine, drive it 60+ miles daily, 62 Dodge Lancer GT with a slant 6
Beer and a carb kit goes about as well as beer and a paint job... ask me how I know
You weren't getting bombed...  you must have been bombed when you bought the truck  nyuk nyuk nyuk
I love your channel it makes me wanna go get my 1977 Datsun 620 going but moog drunk is better at doing a carb is better then I’ll ever be sober 😂
Have any trucks you wanna give away ?
Steve Dulcich special! I bet Frieburger would buy it from you for Steve
Have you given up on putting out videos regularly?  Used to be every Friday? Everything ok?
WE WANT MORE drunk mook and Kevin videos  !! 🤪
I'm a new subscriber i like watching just wish you didn't say God d_ _  n all the time
"It still has its Cats" Why?
SAVE HER SHES A BEAST! I'd call her the Hulking Rose lol, could be a car hauler with some work in your shop.
Great episode.. and everything Mook said while wrenching on that carb is what I say in my head..
the plugs had high resistance, what you are doing is increasing the strength of the spark by sending it back
My guess would be bad ignition module. Rip it out, toss in a points distributor and send it.
watching mook do carb rebuilds can be it's own episode honestly. super funny commentary
good experiment
Just started this... heard cummins swap and immediately hit the like button 👌🏾
I'm going to steal that phrase "strange world, lotta smells" - it's too good to just be a side comment.
They call that the nut hut
Sorry not sorry: I laughed TOO HARD when I heard “I got shocked on the wiener” 😂
PLEASE KEEP IT AND SWAP IT
Mook trying to rebuild a carburetor while drunk was hilarious
Drunken, carb rebuilding, fart hating Mook deserves her own regular segment on JYD!!!
Nevada, or colo
Didn't you know that in the 70's Dodge invented Bluetooth ignition system?🤣🤣🤣🤣
the gap between the plugs top and the coil wire increases the voltage allowing the bad plug to fire
if you get a charge problem check the back of the ameter in the dash..had one with a wire loose on the back of the meter and it got hot and melted out of the dash. before i found the problem i changed the alt. voltage reg. headlight switch..so check the meter in the dash 👍👍
ihave never ever seen a thermoquad because all i know is post 90s hatchbacks but i knew that was a thermoquad because dave once said its one of the rare ones made of plastic
“It happened again!” LMAO
Crash box sounds miserable. Cool truck though.
You're a brave soul working on a piece of crap in the cold. I hate even changing my oil in the cold.
get that Dodge Power Wagon Done!
Awesome video guy's
I related so much to "it shocked me in the weiner!"!!!  So funny
You guys are cool for helping Finnegan
Seriously though LOVE the channel I love anything with an engine really learning a lot about how engines work GREAT dead simple explanations as well! Keep it up!
Kevin go sh--t your pants somewhere else OMG I'm CRYING laughing!!!
Drinking :) are you guys and girs drunk?
It sounds like the rear end blown it only Moves In Reverse
Ignition coils intermittent it's not consistent Spark get a new coil please
Should have got spark plug wires too while you're at it
I know it's wrong with it aint got no gas in it
Damn that's a nice rig.
If you want to sell the motor let me know I can used it
Hey I have a truck problem can I ask you on o can fix it
What part of Iowa are you from?
Cop car alternator
If you don't know Mopars, dont mess with them. They are not a ford or chevy . They are their own beast. You don't dominate them. You work with them.  A 440 WILL pick the front end up, off the line if you LET IT.
The 440 drinks a lot of gas. So it takes a lot of gas to bring them back to life. Gulp gulp , vroom vroom. That's a MOPAR baby.
Mook's carb rebuild was amazing! 🤣
Hey buddy hope mooke is doing good see yal soon good luck
Just wait till you have to drop the starter and the header to change the back plug on the passenger side. loads of fun. But results in , Catch me if you can. lol
It's a Mopar.. Clean the points, clean the rotor, clean the plugs, and fire that mother up. Hot-wire the coil if need be. 440 Big-Blocks were great engines.
Bluetooth headphones /bluetooth spark plugs aswell 😂😂😂 keep up the good work restoring older cars and trucks
"It's an old 727"  Oh shit he's about to bring out an old passenger jet!
Grab that cougar lol
Red head life
Best carb rebuild show 😂😂
Looks like a thermoquad carb used on late 70s lean burn enigines.
I would be interested in buying it....
50:14-50:20 is perfect.
check all the spark plugs with your  ohm meter .
another couple that has animals instead of kids. Our generation is nuts.
In Maine here you be in heaven I see bunch places wit rigs.. lol!!
Beautiful truck. The ThemoQuad is a great carburetor, rebuild it. That 727 transmission is pretty much bulletproof too, and as far as automatic transmissions go, they are fairly easy and inexpensive to rebuild.
It's a adventurer with ramchrager badge  you guys are idiots when it comes to Mopar let me buy it off you instead  It has a bird bath hood  maybe from a. Ramcharger
Reckon the rear brakes are locked up?? I'm just recalling you mentioned air brakes when you are the bottom side... Try backing those off.
that truck would be awesome with a 12 valve cummins swap
I've just binge watched every episode and enjoyed all the content.
That noice you here is the spider gears in the rear end
Your best most used revival has got to be that damn yard cart lol
Looks joke went unnoticed and it’s not cool. -it still has its cats.
🍺🍺🔥🔥💙
And this is drankin with mook! This was absolutely hilarious! I would totally recommend this be a regular thing but mook might end up in AA if I request this ☝️
You got it to run though. You didn’t know that the transmission was gone. And to mook it’s ok we all spill some “water” every now and then.
WHY WOULD YOU PUT THAT BOAT ACHOR POS CUMMINS JUNKYARD SCRAP ENGINE IN THAT TRUCK
'It still has its cats...'  Comedy gold right there.
Clever thumbnail
Kevin, I have an 89 Dodge Dakota, 3.9l V6, 3speed automatic which may be what you are looking for. Park is a bitch, but otherwise the transmission is good. Make offer.
It's so much fun watching Kevin and Mook "let their hair down" and just be silly and having fun.
Drop the tranny big "K" then the buyer won't have to  ! Big selling point ?
12v swap!!!!! Hell yeah   It’s not a 53 block right ?!? Mine is 🤣😭
You get a new camera?  Quality looks great!
Thermoquad!
What the little three wheels green thing that Keven is using?
Love the cummins swap idea!
Please keep working on the truck I'd love to her up and runnin
🤣😂🤣😂🤣 alcohol always helps in the entertainment 😂!!!
Your plugs are fuel fouled or in other words carbon fouled. Spark tracks the carbon right down the side to ground. Least lines of resistance.  You can take a oxy acetylene torch and blow them out and they'll work again for a while.
Give it to Dylan, he'll do something cool with it! It runs pretty decently! Rock on 🤘 guys n gals!!!
Sick truck! Time to take the next step and tear that bad boy down to the frame.
Just give your lady friend 😉 an old Milwaukee's best. And do that bush stuff in Minnesota River.
We all need a mook in our toolbox 😂
F.O.R.D Fugged up old rebuilt Dodge.
Spark plugs can short out. Likely they were flooded several times.  The reason why the plug fires when held away from the plug is because the separation will increase the voltage.
One of my friends here in Finland is originally from Minnesota. He used to live in trailer park at there.
Not just Dodge but a body 68 or 69 dart. If you wanna go fast start with the lightest car just saying 😎
I have no idea what you're doing - but you guys are hilarious.  Keep spilling the water :D
What  happened  to the cornstar MG?
YES! For the ancient love of Christ's cold corpse go buy the biggest weight distribution hitch you can find and put it on that SoSET of a truck Ford convinced you to buy. If you don't, you'll all be joining Christ and we don't want to be losing Mook yet. You other two can stick around also, Mook seems to be attached to one of you. Buy that bleeding hitch.
"Buzzed Mook Builds"  needs to be a regular segment from this point forward,  that was great!
Glad to see an old Dodge on the channel! I bought an '87 D150 a few weeks ago and rescued it from it's grave.
Look into adapting a ford zf5 or zf6 behind that Cummins. They're easier to find and work well
Why don’t you at some point try your hand at a complete ground up frame off restoration? I’d certainly watch that… in addition to these awesome adventures of course
GenY hitches make an isolated hitches setup. Its beefy
Lol mans got an engine with the all new Bluetooth spark plugs😂😂
put the bed on something else?
Try a local trans shop
Hello sir I am new here 😋💕
Why Cummins swap it? Piss off the Dodge boys and put a Powerstroke in it.
36:29 me when your mom
I wanna see the twin engine goKart tbh
I will say this much the Weathers been weird.... also I believe if you can find an old dodge truck airport tug with the Cummins it should have the nv4500 manual trans in it
Kevin, I just wanted to leave a comment to let you know how much I appreciate your content! I've recently inherited a '65 Riviera and all your videos are helping me learn a lot about the car, how everything in it works, and most importantly how to bring it back to life! Incredible stuff, I hope you continue providing content for a long while!
15:16 I have now seen four kitties -I believe- and only Hobbes has got a little pet, y’all can do better
4k60 -- man, you're a Rock Star! Wish the rest of youtube learnt from you.
I'll take the 440 for my Ramcharger
Seriously I had  escort drive into my shop for a oil change. I go to restart it and no go... I fought with it for hours and finally just said hell with it, start throwing parts at it. First plugs, new module, new this and new  that.... what the hell??? My goofy neighbor says did you change plug wires? No, they never go bad that quick.... he persists and so I grabbed some random wires out of the stash. I just touched the starter.... and it was cold as a mother in laws kiss here in alaska. It fired right up, every time and ran great. I put the old wires that fit best on it and no start again... mind you this neighbor lady always had me do the work on her car. I ordered up new wires an install... fires right up and run great so.... sometimes I guess, plug wires do die!
Awesome truck
I’m not going to lie, this should be the new car hauler.
Nice video
Dylan McKool might be interested in it . He's a Mopar guy.
Ay you gonna have to put a ls in that limo now the video has 2 million views now
Come see if you can get my 49 Chrysler Windsor running!!
Something is pretty angry in that trans.
Like all old dodges. The transmission is junk find a manual to throw in it.
Well…. You did your best….
I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work. 😎 Thomas A. Edison
Maybe like some sorta water bladder than you strap onto the trailer when it’s empty to add weight? Something that folds up and you could toss in the truck when the trailer is loaded?
KITTY !!
You talked about pulling half the plugs to start it but that’s how my grandpa actually started his two cylinder lawn mower for a while when his starter was going out
Id say the front pump inside the gearbox is gone
What's the towing capacity on the 440 big block dodge d350?
Nolan told me I had to like and subscribe. Long live the imperial. Thank you for what you do.
It's called a magic tray 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I need a ramp truck for my ramp truck.
Mooky,,,,
Where’s the F250
A MOPAR MAN knows how to deal with working on a THERMOQUAD !  Wish I would have found a big block 440 for my ratrod gasser pickup
Love the big dodge ! What are y’all going to do with the 440 and transmission?
Don’t know but, from what I’m seeing you may want to spend a little more time on this one. Just a thought.
Dodge power👍
Leave it to an engineer to buy a truck out of a field. Then find a giant rats nest in the glove box and blame dodge for the issue.  Spoken like a true Ford owner lmao. Still love the channel been watching a long time and they put out good content consistently. @junkyardigs
The drunk carb rebuild was the best part of the video 😂 I love how you guys keep it real! I don't usually like super long videos but this is one channel I will watch even if it's over an hour. Keep em comin brother
Bad earth on coil or engine
They're a carburetor built out of Baker light I actually have a couple in a set of carburetors that friend of mine gave me
Perhaps a visit from Dylan McCool is appropriate for this vehicle?
Dodge has a poor Pole balanced resistant Box that if it don't work even in 72 the insurance crank your buddy over it pulled bar and garage has just worked on a SIM murder drunk but you can't bypass them with the GM4 public mission module that's what a lot of people do a lot of people make a plate and bolt to the firewall and wire up the gym for public mission model it's the same thing all it does is fire the Ignition the GM Australia is quite a bit stronger spark Then the old style and mission Michael Britt Dodge usedr not to mention it's cheaper to use the GM macho
Reminded me of squad 51 ol dodge..They just had a 50th anniversary. Great content! Saw y'all while checking out Pole barn for the first...😂😂😂😂
so much dodge hate
Now I know how to rebuild a carb like a professional thanks mook👍
Edelbrock bought the rights and tooling to Thermoquad carburetors, and that is what they sell as their name brand line of carbs to go with their intakes. If you need parts, or to just trash that old dead carb and replace it.
I wouldn't junk the a/c compressor in the truck there the best
6speed is the best trans for Cummins you'll probably learn how to fix the rest of them besides that
Could you please shoot the limo with some nitrous like you suggested a while back?! That would be a cool video
You should get that International back on the road.
What happened to the limo?
Nolan sent me.
The 78 Power Wagon that I had on the channel was doing that and I was trying to figure out exactly what was wrong with it and it come down to the little computer box mounted on the driver's inner Fender that thing was bad and I replaced that and truck ran great
Who else is here from the donut media video?
No,  lie wish this was my truck :) hope you find parts this is an awesome truck. I have a 1992 Dodge W250 that I love.
Where my Donut homies at?
Wiener shock- free Viagra?
That thing is sick!
That's some solid work. Hello from Donut. Thanks for helping Nolan?  We need to get you all a snatch block sponsorship.
OR. Keep the 440 and LS swap the rig and put a GM trans in it.
Mook Drunk is the best thing to watch as she fixes things.  Reminds me of my daughter.
Hello, from donut 🍩
Dang near bust up laughing when he said we just had to say it was warm like all I could do is think of when I lived in Denver and I would walk to school on SUPER FKN WINDY DAYS much worse then some feet of snow in my opinion like I HATE the wind indeed and Denver made me hate it and just walking to school in expensive ass boots you have dry feet but a car thought hey lets splash this poor kid walking to school with a muddy slush like hey thanks assholes it was colder yesterday 2 redbulls and some coffee and like oz of whacky tobacco got me through just one day it was so fkn cold but still warmer then yesterday is what you say
You need to get a shocker hitch
Jan 18
Hi today is my bday
If you choose not to keep it, sell it to Dylan!
May need to pull the rear wheels and check the drum brakes and parking brake.  I've had jeeps that will do that, you can reverse and not drive with a Chrysler transmission.  Also to note: once the linkage comes undone on those transmissions you don't know what gear you're in and it can be really hard to get it to stay in drive.  Reverse and neutral are easier.
Great vid, very cool!!!!!! 👍👍
Of course you gotta call Dylan McCool  when you have Mopar issues.
Gotta love the subtle product placement.  We need a MOOK's CARBURETOR OVERHAUL SERVICE tee shirt!
Thanks for helping to get the Imperial running. You da man!
Here from Donut. Showing support!
While I would fear for her liver,  I think we need more Drunk Mook.   I haven't LOLed like this at a car video on YT ever.
Ugh. Still love you bro, but Raycons are so bad. As long as they’re paying the bills!
I'm here after seeing you on Donut Media. Awesome content!
Thank you for helping Nolan!
Can I have it
Somehow, I dont think a normal car battery , old battery cables and the old starter motor are not a good combination on a big block engine. Also, old battery cables will cause weak spark, which might not show up until w.o.t
Drunk carb rebuilding should be an Olympic sport.  People would start watching the Olympics again.  Comedy gold!
Towbar if yo that close to home bud I got a old u haul one that works great for that or build one
You two rock I love your channels keep up the great videos
привет из России😁
Gen y hitch with bag
Dodge has to be in neutral to ck trans fluid
Sounds like tours converter could be blown apart inside.  It sounds good. Wander if it's worth pulling the pan. Thanks again guys
Great work 👌  chunks again guys👍
I'm an,a.c.delco fan every year I'd clean my plugs,in spring and maybe half into the season. Ran the same Delco plugs in my 85 harley for seven years. After a compleat upper end rebuild I changed them . They still worked just old👍👍
I have plenty of first generation dodge parts and I'm in southeast Iowa and I would be interested in it
I suspect a cracked porcelain in that spark plug too.  The spark seemed to be jumping through the insulator. The insulator did look to be a pretty good color though at least...
Back in the day all cars with Amp gages ran the hot through the Amp meter. Not just MoPar. Chrysler was the first to introduce electronic ignition and Alternators. Remarkable! I've had a spark plug sandblaster/cleaner for over 40 years. Get one you'll love it.
It happened AGAIN?!
Mook pron from @43:00 to @50:00   nerds!
If your doing a Cummins swap put a Allison Transmission behind it.
She's pretty funny when she's intoximated. 🤪
Guys gotta let a feller know  Stop breathing in that hanta virus my guy. Bad bad stuff
Since you say you have so many Fords around, pull the bed and stick it on a ford chassis. Other than that, sell some of that crap and fix the Dodge....
Does that have a 2spd rear axle?
Dylan McCool just needs to get this awesome rig off Kevin's hands. Externally it looks solid. Dylan more than likely has the junk laying around to get it moving properly.
Hey rn on facebook marketplace there is a 64 Plymouth Cuda' for 1,500 in Jefferson IA. It's been up for months, and the interior is garbage, but it has an old v8 in it with a carb on top but no fuel filter. Idk if you'll see this or pick up the car but it'd be cool to see it happen because I've seen that car for so long, but I can't afford another car project. I love ur work!
I love your guyses character, especially you Mook
I need this truck This is definitely my dream truck and I’m dead serious lol I would love to have a four door 1st gen and with a 440 I have all kinds of Mopar parts hell I have a 440 sitting on a engine stand and I have a step side bed that I could cut and stretch it into a long step side bed haha
I dream about having a Dodge ramp truck. The way things were As my car club saying goes, "Older is better and the older the better!"
Sounded like planetaries in the transmission
Hey y’all from MamaCard in Florida!
It's been determined finally, these videos need more alcohol and a roll of TP for Kevin. Hilarious!
Best carb rebuild tutorial ever. That's exactly how I do it.
I am so sorry!  I laughed my ass off when you got sparkleated!  Love you guys, miss the mid-west.
Badass
Literally bought a boltster cause of you guys!!
I highly recommend a shocker air hitch or a Gen-Y torsion hitch. One of those will give you a much smoother ride towing and will reduce the chucking you are feeling through the truck. Also that was the best carb rebuild I've ever seen lol
In my experience. When you pull a sparkplug wire off and the spark picks up with a small gap. You have a bad plug wire. I grew up working in my uncle's auto shop. He showed me that trick, if the miss goes away when you pull the wire with a small gap, you need a sparkplug wire.
Is the puppy dog doing well? Haven’t seen her in awhile.
That IH is way more cool tho.
awsome video kevin sad little truck ran good but she dont want to move lol hopefully you find parts for her somewhere who knows thumbs up and shared
That thing is sweet!
One thing I have noticed: Raycons basically have not changed since the first time I've seen them, like 5 years ago at this point.
At least send one of the grand prixs up that ramp!!
Put some lucas in it
Kevin finally a good episode no goofin off just great revival thank you
Roadmaster active suspension spring leaf assist for that Highway shaking
Sure do miss the limo.
I would love to have a truck just like that!
The worst thing you can do to an engine is put either in it. it is a sad thing to see someone who has virtually no mechanical knowledge dump either in a very rare and savable engine!
Loved having Moog a part of the video. LOL! Total comic relief. Love you guys. And these beaten down old projects.. ever thing of fixing an import? I wanna help!
Why encourage people to bug people about their vehicles on her property that just wrong because in Kansas they come the people bug you but your vehicles they come back and steal from you
i do have a brand new 2wd nv4500 from Zumbrota drivetrain. rebuilt by them.
I just want drunk carb rebuilding videos from now on.
It's rough watching gm/ford guys working on Dodge's. I know as a Dodge guy doing basic stuff on Dodge's to look at ford/gm stuff and go, why is that everything is ass backwards from what I'm used to. Also people do dumb stuff thinking they should work but don't...mostly because of the ass backwardness of the whole situation.
between the smoke and the cold, yall aint gona have any mosquitos
I love it. On todays episode of junkyard drunks... :D
I almost bought this truck
the sounds of those old gear-reduction Chrysler starters when they're struggling.  Sounds like "No no no no no no no no no."
24:20 LO funkn L!
Actually sometimes it's my way to fix missing cylinder : took a spark cable a little bit away for a while, and the plug can miraculous be cleaned
Hello All!  Rocco’s son here.  Yes my dad did pass in January of 2019.  Crazy to see old things of his popping up here and there.
Never seen a drunk carb rebuild before! I mean, I learned nothing, but I learned it in a really good way. Awesome!
Sell it D Mc C...
Gap the plugs to spec and test the coil
Rebuild the  carb again
Stand back
Don't scream,  OK
Been looking for a d150 for a while ... when I find one I'm building it up like this
Don't hit the carb , don't hit the carb.lllllloooollll
Her nose got red after the whiskey.
Can you leave the truck along the road for ever
Try 48 volt only once
this is great so should do more segments like this building carb build off between you both lol.
46:11 I thought you were supposed to say "That felt good!", lol!
Man mix u up some 2stroke gas to use for dry starts it help lube up the dry cylinders...
Thermoquad carbs are great. I had one on my 71 Dodge 340 demon. Mine was a 750 CFM IIRC you can tweak them easily.
I've heard "Same shit, different toilet" before, but never heard "I don't know shit from shat" lol!
I'm surprised it's a TorqueFlite, and not a New Process 4 speed.
So Mook is behind the camera on this one?
"Now, Daddy ran whiskey in a big block Dodge, he bought it at an auction at the Mason's Lodge" - Steve Earle
Yay I will have to let my orange taby named Oliver know that I found another cat that shares his brain cell. (Because as you know they all share only one)
I know what the problem with that truck it’s a Dodge
If you find a box full of diaper by your mailbox you know who it's from 😂😂
That big block deserves to be in a real nice New Yorker or Imperial
Now folks this is a true Dodge Ram not built by fiat or stelantis
Awesome old Dodge, great find and purchase Kevin & Mook! Cold or hard starting engines, carefully hit em" with 24 volts from two 12-volt batteries... it works! Good old Carter Thermo-Quad carburetor... I've seen hundreds of those thrown away in scrap piles around here. Why are you touching the grille with your wiener schnitzel... do all mechanics do that?
When you start them up,fill the carb with fuel,try to start it for 5 seconds stop,fill it up again,pump the heck out of it like you're flooding the carb/dont try to start it ...let it sit for 10-15 minutes,pump it once,old the pedal down 1/4 way down and it will start and hold the pedal 1/4 down,might have to play with the pedal for 1 minute or 2 so it runs on its own..I started hundreds of old Mopars like this,real easy...I have issues with Ford/GM they are harder to get going..
"They're not that bad, people are just wieners about them" - sounds like Kevin about Quadrajets.  :-)
Hope it gets saved. Good one!
The 727 pump itself runs in neutral, it just gets redirected right back to the pan and doesn’t pressurize. Putting it in neutral pressurizes the system.  There are aftermarket control spool valves that pressurize in all shifter positions.    Also, you can bypass the ammeter by running a #8 wire from the battery or big lug on the starter relay directly to the B+ terminal on the back of of the alternator. Saves pulling the dash.  It’s fun to watch Mopars make you suffer needlessly…  they know when they’re dealing with a Ford guy.  😂  Finally, When you see the light and realize you need a Mopar (so at least one car will always run :p)  buy an FBO ignition module and throw the factory style one in the trunk as a spare.  The FBO is pin-compatible, has a settable rev limiter, and bypasses the ballast.  Anyway, all in fun. You should see me work on my AMC.  This is a great revival, as always. Hope to see more of the truck in the future.
Hey Angus , next time put your purse down before you try to move the shift lever .
I have good luck with starting old engines that have set for years by putting 80 90w gear oil in the cylinders. It has worked on engines that had 10 lbs compression. Once the engine starts and warms up the rings come loose and the engines start and run good after.
I like that truck!
Very nice vedio
"Strange world, lotta smells"- Mook
Truck is a 77 not a 72.
I commend your bravery to not panic about a transmission that sounds like a thousand destroyed rocks in gear
do you usecelcius cause 41 degrees celcius is HOT AF trust me im australian i know how hot 43 is
That valve train is crying haha
That truck was supposed to be on road kill
WOOOO FINALLY A DIESEL SWAP
Well, I deleted my comment about the Ford because I did not want to come off as bitchy. I am pretty new to your content and you erred the sub so thank you for that. What I have seen I really enjoyed.  The only thing I did not like was the drinking. I can skip past that part yeah but it really does not make a difference that much because I know it was there. As a recovering addict things like that bother me and I would be willing to bet there are a lot of other people that it would bother as well. Just gets that thinking going that you want to stay away from and avoid and if that meant avoiding your content then it would be even more disappointing because I do enjoy the videos so again thank you for that. I am about 95% sure this comment is not even going to be seen anyways but if it does get seen then it might be something to think about. A lot of people who are into cars could have some background with drinking or other substances issues. Anyways for the 3rd time now thank you for the videos.
Yesss your doing more vids!
You should name the truck smokey.
You guys need to get a room
You guys should have Dylan McCool in all these episodes involving the '72-'93 D-Series trucks since you don't know much about them and it can be a real awesome team revival! But if you sell it, see if Dylan McCool will buy it off you?
Any chance the E-brake was stuck/frozen?  It could happen... Ask me how I know lol
We need more beligerent mook rebuilding carbs 😂😂
Mook is content :)
I have a project that I'm working on and unfortunately it's on hold until warmer weather. However I am curious however if a boltster will work with bolts nuts washers and screws for very small engines. As well as bolts nuts and washers for other things as well. The project I'm working on I think y'all might like and enjoy. I would love to get y'all's advice and opinions on it and maybe put me in contact with someone who knows more about different types of small engines for advice and that person's opinions as well. If possible I would like to talk to y'all on the phone and or video chat with y'all as well as whoever else y'all can think of that might be willing and able to help me. It's my very first project and I'm already stumped about what to do with the engine and the torque converter.
What ever happened to the limo ?
We    need    more     MOOK  !
I'm trying to figure out that spark from far away but not close
There is not enough likes, for all the LOL'S and rotf loling.....
It's all good stuff to be sure, but the shop rebuild fart fest and spilled drinks Mook show was glorious
drunk carb rebuilding should be a regular slot
that is what he said "where is the hole" lol
Love that truck!
These two are meant for each other
Did you ever get to installing NOS on the Limo?
Now my hat is off to Dylan McCool, but man, those Mopars are just odd as hell. I feel like they were, for the most part, inferior to the Fords and Chevys of their day. I tend to lean toward the iconic look of the late 60s to early 70s Ford trucks myself, but as far as simplicity and reliability goes, I think Chevrolet probably had everyone beat back in the day.
I love how you guys grab advise off each others areas of expertise, I follow dylan's channel as well.  excellent watch.....also beautiful cats!
71-74 amc amx's also ran the  wiring that  way. when the  the  ammeter  burned up you  put a  1/4 inch bolt and  nut through the  ring terminals and keep going
Could the rear end be blown and that’s the noise?
Crazy part is.... I almost bought this a month ago. Fate almost made this no yours lol. Better off in your hands though.
the best JYD videos are the ones where they get them running, knowing that vehicle can be used again. I love JYD but sometimes its not as exciting when its a vehicle that they get running, just for it to be scrapped later, if that makes any sense. I just like seeing a vehicle being brought back to life with a purpose! Maybe this comment was better off for the last video with the rotten plow truck though
what ive learned from revival videos.... Chevys refuse to die. Dodges refuse to live. Fords just try to kill you...
Engineering degrees from where? Whatsamatter U frostbite falls?
You should fix her up and put the interior out of a brand new Laramie in it. And of course a 12V
Drunkyard Digs....
Looks like the squad truck from the TV show 'Emergency'.  Well the front anyway.
What happened to the plugs might be carbon tracking. I had it happen on a Ford once.
You said it was warm at forty something. In Dallas we were in the upper seventies today. Just my thing as I hate cold weather. Our normal high for this time of year is fifty seven.
After the last truck video, you should have brought 10 batteries!
Mook is so goddamn hot! You did good pal.
This thing needs a Dodge Dakota 318 high torque mini-starter.
puta  454    in  it   and a  th400  ??
Fun fact about Chrysler engines, if the distributor is in the front, it's a big block (383, 400, 426, 440, etc.) If it's in the back it's a small block (318, 340, 360).
No longer interested
Road trip to Dylan's and dump it on him
Sometimes premix in the carburetor works better than spraying in cylinders
That is a super cool dodge I’ve always wanted one just like that
Are you targeting 10 year olds as your main demographic? Why is everything so funny?
My brothers 75 power wagon has the turn signals low down like that
Atleast magic smoke did not escape from the parts yet.  Spoke too soon magic smoke is now escaping.
I would love to have that old Dodge tow truck
Well it’s a dodge so a bad trans is kinda expected
“were getting bombed” best reaction to a plane ive ever heard
That was a lot of farts. Still farted more while watching.
hobbs cracks me up.  the banter between you 2 proves that you guys are 2 peas in a pod.  also its great to see that mook is doing great after her surgery.  one more thing.... i couldnt keep my eyes off that ford wagon.  that episode was great.
I laughed so hard @ 49:20 ...lol
Way to make it on yt trending page! Getting bigger every day!
Dodge + electronics = no bueno
Some how i got unsubscribed that don't make sense
Cummins swapppppp
That's just a reduction starter
Get some NGK plugs, better than champion.
clear way to clean plugs is to heat them up with a torch and then wire brush the carbon off
It's all shits and giggles until someone giggles and shits    😂 Lolz 😆
Some good ole  Engine-nerding underway
Turbo charged 318 in split Dodge/Fargo truck
Loving the first edition of Drunk Mook carb rebuild school. 😂
Is there any reason that you can't just put a transmission in it?
“It happened  AGAIN!!!…”. I’m dying!!
Omg I can't get enough of how fluffy Hobs is
Never use champion spark plugs. They suck!
Always Great Content Kevin, Poor Old Thing Needs Some Love To That Drive-Line, Seems Like That’s A Dylan McCool Special, LoL!!
There's cool cars out there then There's this hell yea
Inching towards 1million!
I had an old school mechanic show me the trick with the spark plug and increasing the gap between the plug and the coil wire. I think it increases the peak voltage. Because science.  Literally drove around with a plug half plugged into the coil so the cylinder would run 🤷‍♀️ work trucks amirite
check with rv salvage yards that chassis was made into a lot of rv models
What happened to the MG Midget? would fit pretty good on this :D
“We do have engineering degrees so there’s that” yeah nothing more disconcerting has ever been spoken
That truck is not a 72. 77-78 unless the dash and grill have been swapped
40 on trending
Don't understand why people have to copy other YouTube videos. Do something original .
Tonight on Junkyard Trucks : just a little something Dylan Mc Cool would like.
Awesome video as always!!
Give Mook another whuskie.😄
That is why I bought a deck over trailer so I never would have to worry about something hitting the trailer fenders
Hey. I love and enjoy watching your videos that you make here on youtube, and I'm more or less a big fan of yours. Hope you guys keep making videos for the next many years. Regards, Michael.
A short screw works as a battery terminal tightening device..
This whole video was a riot but especially the unhinged lighthearted caro rebuild 🤣🤣
When in doubt call uncle tony
Just gonna say this right now, you've got a ramp truck.. it's a ramp... on a truck... if we don't see something ramping OFF it by the end of the year we're gonna be really disappointed! Great to see you all having fun doing what you love to do. Keep those fingers and toes warm!
Can't stop laughing with mook's Carb Rebuild 🤣 love it 🤟💪💪💪💪💪
Mike Finnegan from roadkill had one you could always message him
My daughter was born August Friday the 13th and she weighed 8lb 13oz.
I've gotten probably 10-15 cars given to me for free just by stopping by places nobody else will stop by to ask. I get a bunch of free parts the same way. Or join groups with not a lot of people and start looking through the ads and the people with a bunch of cars. Off the beaten path Is where you find all the deals. Regardless the path that is. Also I could probably make a couple calls about an nv4500 if you haven't found one but im down in northwest Missouri
The Waffle House has found its new host
great video! nearly died of laughter 30:07 hope everything woks out on the rig !
break the porcelain on one of those junky champion plugs and you will see exactly why they suck... the spark runs through a spring ...
I probably could watch hours type of carburetor building
I think that is a good canidate to fix up and use. Cummins swap like you said. Rust repair. make it "new" and use the crap out of it. Its like your own version of the roadkill ramp truck
From what I've heard from other builders (DeBoss Garage for one) Cummins 6bt into an old Dodge/Chevy is almost a drop-in, as the 6bt was in dodge trucks, lots of the bolt-holes are the same for various engines throughout the years. For Ford and other brands there has to be conversion kits because they have different hole patterns and such being completely different auto makers. Take that with a 5lb grain of salt as I hear this 3rd/4th hand and don't know for sure. :)  Also, I suspect the trans is internally grenaded, how you got it to go forward the first time was some of the chunks lining up and catching to push it forward. That's what the sound is whenever you put it in drive/reverse is the chunks being slushed around until something lines up and it moves.
I would love to see the Cummins swap. A floor pan replacement how-to is definitely something I would love to see on the channel. This truck is super cool and I would love to see you guys make it your toy hauler.
For long trailers, a gooseneck is much less violent than a bumper-pull. Of course, you have to re-learn backing with the pivot point over the rear axle instead of a few feet behind it. Totally worth it, though, in my experience.
The cushmans provide a comical twist to this otherwise serious and formal channel.
No offense but she’s a little weird 😂😂😂😂😂
She is funny 😂Drunk as a skunk!! Love it. Fan Sweden 🇸🇪.
Maybe you should wear a condom when working on ignition.  Be safe, yknow?
The 440 should have a dual ballast resistor, not a single like one that was in this truck
Kevin If I was you go with the nv5500 especially in the ramp truck with a 24 valve not 12 perfect set up and all the power and torque
Did Mook get pregnant? she disappeared from the shop, her brothers around, she sounds different too (maybe  new camera or something) and you've got that dad logic now too.
I cried laughing when you got shocked in the pecker
Iowa State Potato Water. Also known as 5 0’clock 😶‍🌫️
did i miss it or was there a video of the cushman truckster? best little old school haullers put a lot of weight through one of those!
COCK SHOCK!
Hey since you’re pretty knowledgeable on dentsides is there a reason why my 77 doesn’t have a paint code on the vin, it was bought by born free, an iowa based camper company I’m sure you’ve heard of, just curious
Hope y’all are ready for that snow this Wednesday, Jim flowers is saying 5-8 inches over night in omaha!
Oh my god Drunk Mook and Kevin had both me and the wife laughing we had tears in out eyes, Please Please we want more Drunk Mook and oh my that poor carb.
Speaking on the Limo, we ever gonna get the nitrous episode? Lol
That transmission sounded like a blender full of bolts!
l remember those plugs had a crazy wide gap... wider than you have those
13:15 Oh it still has its cats... 🤣🤣🤣
Cummins swap is needed!
Confucius say:  "I don't know if it's stopped em, but it hasn't let them go again"   🤣
i would love to have the 55-56 dodge truck
So, there isn't a former winch on the transmission? Like in towtrucks?  That have to be disconnected for it to drive. Or has the rear brakes got som air now when it started and now stuck?
Here in west Virginia on jan 1 it was 71 for 3 day and on the 4th it was -4
There was a CarTalk puzzler on this years and years ago. As I recall, it went along that on a cold day a guy was having trouble starting his car. An old mechanic came by and pulled all the wires off the plugs just a little. In effect, this increased the electrical resistance of the path and therefore increased the heat of the spark allowing the car to start, and then the wires could be pushed back onto the plugs.
How about ramp truck and doge car goes to Tennessee if you know what i mean Kevin he will love the ramp truck
I WANT IT!!!!!! Also, DON’T trash the thermoquad!
49:00 Finally we can see a real pro dealing with the carburetor! 🤓👍
Best carb tutorial.....EVER!
I since @Dylan McCool is drooling right now 😆
I still want to know what happened to the burnt nova
When I was a young mechanic back in the 70s i discovered i could often start a flooded engine by pulling  the coil wire out about 1/2 to 3/4 inch creating a gap for the spark to jump just like your situation. I don't know why it worked but it did. subsequent running of the engine to clear the flooding and they were good to go. Something about the fouled plugs.
At least now I've seen someone other than myself accidently shock their dick
That beucknose in the background is nice
Mook should do her own technical videos. She puts some pretty good humor into it.  LMFAO 🤣🤣
I'd love to rebuild that hauler. According to the comments here the rig has famous history. I like the red theme, but whilst blasting and welding pretty much all panels I'd go to the original paint job it left the factory with. This project is an all hands on deck type of deal. I'd not be the man for the job and i sincerely hope it gets saved and not bashed to bits.
Chevy and dodge run best with A/C Delco plugs
The Rebuild portion was fantastic, but Kevin needs to lay off the mexican when filming or start bottling that stuff to use as a nitro injection source.
Does Angus just wait until it's cold before he comes to help with videos 😀  Still, good to see him back in another restoration!
When you're trying to crank your Dodge ramp truck, and you accidentally write a Skrillex album...🤠
You may not have met your goal of the Dodge actually moving but I give you the highest rating in entertainment! You guys are a great team and I enjoy you very much 👍✌️🇺🇲
Plugs ain't no good, when they do shit like that and your getting good fire everywhere else, but by the time I'm watching this, you probably already figured it out, right Kevin?! Rock on bud 🤘
There were a lot of things I loved to do when I was drunk, but I don't think I would want to rebuild a complex carb when I am drunk. lol
I like watching videos of these old ramp trucks being brought back to life. Would be nice to see more of them at the race tracks.
Drunk Mook rebuilding a carb is friggin hilarious.
I have an idea for a video. Find one of your friends preferably a female who does not know anything about carburetors give her a couple drinks have her rebuild one I think it’ll be hilarious
I can just bet there's some Mopar guys that want that Thermoquad. Uncle Tony to name one...
My '79 Volare had that same diagnostic connector. I have no idea why it is there or how to use it, but it is apparently a factory mopar thing.
I have some pictures of this rig with some impressive vegetation growing inside when it was parked in Iowa.  I remember seeing it and was blown away with how cool it is.  So glad it’s being rescued!
I agree with Mook  Busch light = Nearbeer.🤣😵‍💫😆
Getting towards the 💯 Thousand 👍🏻
Love your videos keep on going you made me die losing it when you were describing the hitch in the trailer bouncing look up a geny hitch they make them where they got weight distribution and it allows the hitch go up and down the flex that would probably take a lot of the bouncing out from the trailer lot of good reviews on him he could see him on YouTube
Maybe you should get a hold of Doulceh and Freiburger to fix your thermoquad.
Love seeing work like this!!   Normally I wouldn’t comment like this, but if you’re keeping an eye out for Dodge projects in the future, I do have a lead on a ‘74 Dodge Dart 4-door that’s pretty decently intact going for cheap down here in Tucson, and I have a ‘69 Dodge 413 with a fresh Allison transmission sitting on my farm in Northern Arizona I wouldn’t mind letting go to a good home. Let me know if you’d be interested. :)
I’ve always been curious about, how you make money on these rescues… Are you setting them up in driveable condition and selling out, to keep rescuing more cars or sponsors?😁  Either way… Love the content! Hello from Denmark 🇩🇰
Great video! I would recommend using fogging oil vs WD-40 in the cylinders.
Limo video has 2.4M views, where's the twin turbo LS swap for the limo? Huh? HUH? lol
It's a 70's model.  Which year? Yes
A drunk mook section on every video would be just fine. Comedy gold 👌🏻
Kaboom happens!
Hope you decide to build it I'd love to see it back on the road
Be funny to see a angry moments video lol
i want it. and the 54 next to it on the open.  so when do Mook's carb rebuild service shirts hit the merch store?
Their engineering professors: #$@&$@$&$+#&$#$$#!
-13 you guys are tougher than this old man lol when I was your age I did the same kind of stuff though lol great video awesome channel
I would subscribe to a "drunkyard digs" channel. Just sayin.
"there's a first time for anything and if it's gonna be anywhere it's gonna be on a dodge." -kevin 2023
If you do end up building it up I'm really excited to see this big thang roll coal and If you end up going turbo I'm gonna love hearing that turbo spool under load with a big bronco or something on the back
If it were an old Ford you'd have lots of parts but probably learn nothing
yea kevin shit your pants on your own time!hahahahahahahahaha i love you mooks
That turbo on the tow rig sounds so nice
Mooking ought to be a term in more common use.
Mooks "tracor" comment wouldn't have been out of place in a uk vid.
Drunkyard Digs
Love it.  Great to see you both on this project. We need more drunk car potato rebuilds :-) .
Kevin should start his episodes with THAT noise. Instant laughter!
The plugs are bluetooth..mopar was ahead of the curve
Start a carb rebuild service with a twist. You also get a video of Mook rebuilding your carb drunk. Then they rebuilt it right the next day while sober. You will make a fortune.
The best thing that could happen is to put another mopar on the back and shove both of them off a cliff on the 4th of July!🎆🎇🎆🎇
Cats were wondering that big mother of a mouse was. They could smell it but couldn't see it .
I won’t run Champions in my lawn mower. Horrible plugs.
10°C aint bad, can you pls include "translations" to metric (meters, KGs, °Celsius)?
Please guys, you HAVE to go back for that lovely old 55 sittin next to this one !!!
Sounds like the rear diff. Transmission might be fine
Does the trans from a ram charger work ?
There should be a show called Mook: After Dark. Give her one drink and have her rebuild carbs.
@dylan mccool here's another Mopar for ya.
That is an awesome Truck
Wtf is mook when she's drunk. Words cannot describe how funny mooks carb rebuild was.
That winch was crying.
Don't let Finnegan see this.  He'll need another ramp truck lol
Yes. More mopar
Why do you find these trucks in the winter 😂🤣😶‍🌫️🥶
Hey look at it this way. The last vehicle had no oil pressure and no reverse. This one had only reverse and really good oil pressure…. So just combine the two and you have one good vehicle lol
It runs but just doesnt drive. A replacement transmission for it should be an easy find as there seem to be lots of old class A motorhomes around really cheap with Dodge 440 engines and good transmissions in them that still run and drive but have severe wood rot in the RV bodies
*This is probably one of my favorite episodes from you two lmao*
The drunk Mook carb rebuild was amazing haha!
I leaned NOTHING  about carburetors.. because I was laughing so hard I couldn't see the screen through my tears 🤣🤣
You now need a whiskey Mook shirt..
Carbitader rebuild kit lol
Forwardly.. lol
You should have bought Autolite plugs for it. Chumpion plugs have been total garbage since the early 80's. Your comparison between the weather in Iowa and MinneSNOWta is pretty accurate depending on WHERE in MinneSNOWta --far northern can be outright brutal compared to even just as far away as central such as the twin cities area..  What part of MinneSNOWta is Mook from?
Please no more well-lubricated Mook shenanigans. My laughter devolved into lung-hacking apoplexy. I can't afford any more ambulance calls.
Hey Angus, long time no see. I worked with you at Federal Mogul.
I love the idea of 440 in car and 12v in this thing. I hope you don't give up on the Thermoquad, they are a cool design
You two make the greatest couple, and that is a sweet ramp truck. Wonderful video as always!!
My construction boss had a 78 dodge truck with a weird reverse cowl hood..huge steering wheel ..like semi size...and a huge shifter ball on the manual trans with a 318...all stock...decent truck
Sounds like a blown rear diff
Good  ☹🇬🇧
I’d love to see this be a finished project
A drunk Mook rebuilding a carb is better than a sober myself trying to find an accelerator pump in a quadrajunk
Junkyardcats lol
Kevin "We'll get good one of these days Mook" Mook "I dunno" Classic, turn it into a shirt.
WTH!!?!! "we think our trans. Kinda doesn't work." kind of, maybe doesn't work. R works n L works kind of. I'm kinda maybe or confused now. I think. $3500 + Mopar tax? Chevy n Ford guys see price as $3150 final price. Mopar guys jumping up n down a dishing our $5600 in a second.   why
the dodge is huge, and the 12 valve has been done, how about scavenging a cummins 8.3 out of an old combine and stuffing it under the ramp truck?
Starter sounds like one for a 318. Get one for a 440 with 1.3KW. Spin that over faster.
Hey what did u do with the plow. On  the. Step side. Chevy.  Kevin
I see. U have the green ford. With the plow. Still.
Hit up fed up fab he may know
The only way you are gonna get a better crank is to replace with a newer starter.
been awhile , great to see you back again mook !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (such a cute smile )
The Waffle House has found a new host
Shocker hitch. Works great hate pulling a fifth wheel without one.
Hi mook how are you
Just got 2nd set of Raycons.  They are excellent for the cost
Mook is hilarious
I'd like to see a build on this truck
BROOOOOOO!!!!!! WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT TRUCK MADE FOR WITH A BACK LIKE THAT????????? WHAT THE HELL DOES IT DO LOLOLOL IM LOST HERE BUT LET ME FINISH WATCHING MAYBE YOU WILL SAY IT LOLOL!!!!! JUST SAYING!!! THANKS, F.M.V.
I picture this truck bagged on some 8s patina built with a patina general Lee riding on the ramp
Back to when you said get off the main road to find a good car…. I was in an accident in 2012 and my truck totaled. I said the exact thing, did it and with the check I found a 1990 suburban with a 6.5 diesel lifted 4” new tires and 85,000 miles for 1500$ cash. Best thing I ever owned!
Surely Dylan needs a Dodge Ramp Truck
If you guys make a carbatater rebuild kit as a gag gift I will totally buy it have mook write the instructions and put a sticker in it and boom sell like hot cakes
#11 on trending!!! Nice, dude. Cheers and all the best to youse!
As ol peg always says, that greasy Ferd is gonna catch second hand Dodge wiring problems. Minty
Oops
If the engine turns over slow and the spark is weak, surely it would be the neutral wire connecting the engine chassis, high resistance.. and explain the sparking at the coil as that is  the path of least resistance or  is it just me?... another  great video guys,
Even if the Dodge didnt move this by far was one of the best vids from you guys keep up the good work !
The Doctors’ Own Confessions In the new Tablet article “China’s Killer Doctors,” both Lavee and Robertson detailed the process of their research and highlighted evidence that was previously documented in the AJT paper.  They noted that 2000 marked the beginning of the rapid expansion of China’s organ transplantation system, including the training of thousands of new doctors, the construction of new hospital buildings dedicated to transplants, patent filings on new transplant technologies, as well as the domestic production of immunosuppressive drugs.  With such rapid development, a leading surgeon told Chinese media that “2000 was a watershed year for the organ transplant industry in China.” Another said the number of hospitals doing liver transplants after 2000 “rose abruptly—like spring bamboo after rain,” according to the Tablet article.  But all of the changes happened even though China has no organ donation system. While some Chinese health officials claimed that death row prisoners were the main source, the increase in transplants continued even after major reforms in the death penalty system that took place in 2007 dramatically reduced the number of executions.  In 2015, Jiang Yanyong, a Chinese military doctor, admitted to a media in Hong Kong that Chinese doctors “would shoot prisoners so they’re not fully dead ... then quickly pull them into the truck and get the liver out.”
Someone find him a transmission for the cummins please the motor is healthy to put into another car
Contact Heavy D Sparks. He can give you some answers. Diesel all the way.
Air brakes need air to release
Drunkyard Mook working that carb rebuild was one of the best parts ever.
Check your timing. Dodge is Notoriously famos
If Mook ever became a comedian or needed a trailer video to become one , that carb rebuild skit is just gold 👌
Rear end bad?
nesara /gesara will be the new rage in Paris Sanfransico dwn tooo dallas and every honkey tyonk and dance hall inbetween
Where is the doggy
Wireless spark plugs. Move over Elon.
727TF-8-Rebuild-Kit Monster transmission doot commm
carbpotaters are good fried and salted
Chewed up sun gear or rear sprag gear. Just get a trans go rebuild kit, a new trans pump, and check torque convertor. And take a look at the valve body while you have it apart. A simple trans rebuild will solve the problem and you and look will have a great car hauler
Drunk Mook made this the best episode ever, just the sheer realism of it all and the reaction to the beer 😂😂😂
Please use Tru Fuel on start-ups! You won’t be sorry!
Drunk Mook is the best. He may need to check his pants. You guys are amazing.
#11 on trending let’s go
Subscribing for updates on this 😂
46:00 start the funniest part. LOL
THERMOQUAD!!!!!
ANGUS! <3
Might be wrong but It looks like you have a slightly modified  u-haul trailer hauler their mechanics or general manager might use these to dispense trailers around pick up broken down ones ect were the sleeper is would have been for their tools they also use to have a tire rack bolted to the back the sleeper they might be doing service on location on a whole fleet of dealers
I took a train trip from Los Angeles to Seattle once and thought that it would be a good way to do old car hunting, because the train tends to go past backyards and fields. Saw a ton a old farm trucks and unfinished project cars in backyards. If you sat on the train with a GPS and noted locations, you could take the train in one direction, to scout, and get a car transporter in the opposite direction and just buy car and trucks all the way home.
OMG, I love tipsy Mook more than I love regular Mook! Mook, you rock!
Putting light duty shocks on your tandem-axle trailer makes it ride smoother empty
9:23 badd ass trailer honestly
Mint loading for the ramp truck
Mook drinking "water" and rebuilding carbs should be it's own channel. Also, id also like to have some of that "water".
No one tell Finnegan. He might try to buy it. He has a slight addiction for ramp trucks
Where there’s a will there’s a mistake good job on the trailer
Sell it to Dylan McCool he would have plenty of parts to put it back together
"Thermoquad, the only carburetor that punishes you for going full throttle", homeless Dave Also, can't wait to get to the Mook carb rebuild part, sounds like fun
Steve Dulcich would love that beast!
#10 on trending!
at least mook didnt start a fire , though that might be a good idea
I have a big block 727 long tail shaft and a 440 out of a Chrysler Newport wagon with only 49,000 miles it has been in a heated garage for a few years
And stop calling one of the best carburetors ever a Quadrapuke Quadra jet is an awesome carb especially for performance. You have to know how to rebuild them if you don’t it’s your ignorance making them a puke. Educate yourself on it, then you will have an awesome running evening
I'd love to see you replace or fix the transmission and get it going!
Honestly. Getting drunk and rebuilding a carb is a whole vibe
It is not a big block
NO IT WONT RUN 🏃🏽‍♀️ THROW IT AWAY GET AN 80’s Square body Silverado and put an LS in it. Then you won’t have to worry about it ever again
Drunk Mook rebuilding a carburetor. Priceless.  Keep the 440 out of the truck for a rebuild and sell the truck.
That transmission sounds strong.
This video describes dodge perfectly 😆
The best carborator rebuild segment ever 😂 pure gold
i thought you married that girl. where are the rings and arguments?
Back when I used to drink we built a TH 350 with a bottle of Segrams…smoothest trans we ever built. Lol
Glad to see it finally getting worked on. Wish my dad would have had the time when it was his.
Get a sparkplug sandblaster from Harbor Freight, it makes almost all dirty old plugs look & work like new. It has saved hundreds of spark plugs, which saved thousands of $$$'s.  I got one almost 10 years ago and I've only needed more media once.
Jan, Fri 13th… was the day before my b-day
you.... motherhecker 😂😂 that whole carb rebuild section had me howling with laughter. just straight giggling like a car that wont stop dieseling after its shut-off. So just when I think its safe to take a drink & mook gets asked a question, the bloody straight face responce "you can scream"... I near enough spat out the contents everywhere. heckin woman! 🤣 you 2 are saints to watch.  honestly? never change peeps, love the content.  UK viewer btw....
I dunno how you screwed up a 440 & 727... Really, I'm not mad.  I'm genuinely impressed.
For god's sake don't let Finnegan see it!!!
Kevin why would you want to sell something you've been looking so long for at least once and almost every video you say you need a ramp truck or a tilt bed trailer lol patcher up and throw the Cummins in er
In the eighties they sold 90s rather they sold really bad 20 mm wires racing wires and there were junk I spent a week trying to figure out why my $40 set was just parking everywhere junk and I put the old old antique wires back on back to normal omigod
Mook is either drunk all the time or like me adhd. I love it.
The Waffle House has found its new host
I would think twice before parting with that one, then again maybe Dylan McCool Needs a project hauler.
Can you take the ramp bed off and put it on one of your Fords trucks?
cool Truck, Knew ya could use one and That means someone else will get Vice Grips!
That’s because they are Bluetooth plug wires😂
Does spilling your drink constitute alcohol abuse?
Build it, ramp trucks are always cool.
They never die. Just ask a slant six.
cummiins swap would be sick
Kevin: I got shocked in the wiener! Mook: Again? lmao
HackNpackshop got his old beater orange rollback home, it just broke down and stranded him a few times
From now on I will refer to Mook rebuilding a carburator as carbutainment because that was hilarious!
bluetooth sparkplugs kinda neat. you should market that
Never had anything run good on a champion plug... Stop using them thirty five years ago..
DUALY TRUCK
If you find a mook marry the mook i found my sam she helped me change a clutch in a 93 eclipse the helped fix a ranger I married my sam
FAIL ! BUT now you know fore shure that  the trans and motor are junk .   TIME FOR A CUMMINS ENGINE SWAP !!  Great video. Thanks
That is an amazing truck and you should definitely continue the build. I'm up in Canada and i can get you an nv4500 or nv5600 pretty easily. if you're interested I'd be willing to trade you a complete swap for the 440 out of that truck and a half decent 727. I'll be down in the U.S. later this year for Powertour with my 79 Wagoneer or 61 d100 . if interested you can find me on Facebook or here on Youtube. we love your videos keep up the good work.
Balancing your trailer helps
Them plugs were the first Bluetooth plugs that worked on that diagnostics plug as well🤣🤣
Will this SMALL BLOCK Chevrolet run after 36 YEARS???
Shocker hitch will help with the empty trailer
yo Mook is too funny!
You guys are freaking great
Is your coil wired backwards?
Gotta say, an old school ramp truck kicks ass!! Too bad about the rust! The Cummins idea is definitely the way to go!! Best of luck whatever you decide!!👍
Like a glove!!
It's funny Mook farted and blamed it on Kevin while rebuilding the carburetor 😆🤣
If you can build it drunk you can drive it drunk
Rat Ramp Truck
Another good video
Wow you have no snow down there, and I thought we were having a mild winter. -10 here is nothing. That's us outside all day doing stuff. We hunker down when she's hits -45
When in doubt with a MOPAR; call Dylan McChrysler...
Is it gonna be forsale I want it
I will pay $3,500 for the truck DELIVERED to Macon Ga. Just find a hot rod fixer in Florida,  tow that down and the Fla car back. Besides you look like you could use some Sun.
The earbuds are Raycon are I know how I lost mine I acted I put it in the wrong here and it fell out
Correct the low and reverse band are the same.  Might be able to save it with band adjustment and I always shift kit the valve body, but no guarantee.
That is an awesome Truck. Would be nice to have it running and able to use it again. Obviously was a heck of a truck back in the day. Thanks for sharing.  Take care, Ed.
Do not Crown Apple and Carb.
Try changing the Trans filter and fluid, that might work. Mopar is famous for not moving when the filter and fluid needs to be changed.
👍👍
So the truck still has its cat, who is obviously called Hobbes, but, for heck's sake, don't let Calvin near that thing!
yoooo number 10 on trending let's get it boys
Thermoquad! The only carburetor that punishes you for going full throttle.
Gotta find out who Rocco chiero is
Hmmm. Did you try turning it off and on again? 🤔  Just kidding. Hello from England, and great video as always 👍👍
Cool ramp truck. That 4 door dodge cab is a nice piece as well with or without the ramp on the back.
Pee pee ⚡️burn. lol
Considering how old and how good of a condition its in im gonna say yes obviously.
That has to be the funniest carb rebuild I have ever seen! Amazing
wow, wireless spark
Theseasonorg explains the whole bible God bless
Dylan takes it 😂😂😂
Lucky bastid. Nice truck.
Lot of midrolls in this video. I’m glad it helps you, but man…
I have two 48RE 4x4 cores you can have if you want to build an automatic. But I'm in Canada and the freight would probably outragious
Hey Kevin,  why don't you get an F350-450 and swap the ramp over to it!
I never heard of no mopars burnin. You shouldnt be messin round stuff you dont know about. Henry is a callin ya. Rooky.
Most underrated line from this episode: "I got shocked in the wiener.  Again."  Lol.  Be safe out there, Kev.
It's all shits and giggles until someone giggles and shits.
FYI, you can use a torch of map gas and burn carbon off of the spark plugs. Also, it will show if the ceramic is bad by a puff of smoke.
This thing is cool. Too bad it’s rusty.
At least it runs, good start!!
Yay more Mook! She is hilarious
Hell at least it runs!!!
As I recall, the Thermoboxes weren't a problem to rebuild - you just had to check for bowel warping (plastic main body) and I THINK the secondary hangers were real thin and prone to bending. Either way, Mook'll probably need four shots to rebuild one.
what happed to the lemmo?
That was water?? 😜 I thought you guys were in Iowa not in Michigan!!! 😂
You can get an adaptor kit for a 4L80e. I know they sell an adaptor plate for those. But it’s not a chevy so you’d have to get creative.
Ide kill for that truck :( miss my 72 power wagon tin grill
727’s are simple to rebuild. Grab a video and a rebuild kit, easy peasy
Honestly, this is the coolest project since the rv trip to rescue the farm of cars! Pleasee keep it going would love to see a racecar on it or atleast use it as a tow rig. Closest you can get to a rollback
The mook section of this video was absolutely hilarious XD
Definitely want to see more drunk Mook rebuilds Lol
Just use sheet metal and fabricate, put it together and do the Cummins swap
Free bags of concrete or sand for wherever or whoever your going to. Put it over the axles and dump, er, dispose of when you get the big honking trailer there to pick up
Might as well put a floor in it, and replace the trans and a basic rewire. The cost of transport would lose a lot of buyers. But if they could drive it home...
One of my favorite channels. Truly great job on this content
8:33 you need a little Uhaul trailer on top of the ramp truck. Like those Russian nest dolls.
The limo went faster
Torque flights had to be different
Mook was a little hammered 🤣 crown apple is nasty🤮
Cherio -,, cherio -,,my my
From Kevin zapping his self, to Mooks drunken rebuild. I can’t stop laughing.. we need more drunken rebuilds from the junkyard digs crew 😂😂
Drunk Mook & Farting Kevin. This is why I watch. 😂😂😂
Use premix fuel to the prime the engine. It will lubricate the cylinders and help it spin over quicker. I'm wondering why you guys aren't putting a jump box on there or a stronger battery
That’s what you get for buying a Dodge. 😂😂🤣🤣🤣.  Dumb old dog gets even. That’s what dodge stands for. No hi my but junk. 😂😂😂😂😂. Ford always. 👍👍👍💯💯💯
the tires locked up in the front  when you went in reverse
Mook's "Crown and Carbs" LMAO👍
and in my opinion champion plugs are the worst junk you can ever buy autolite best plug
30:10  every guy watching cringes
At 28:30 nah we're just having fun with the poor bastard working on the dodge. Not making fun of him
Please. Please. Please!!!  More of whiskey Mook rebuilding carbs!!!
I like that jacket.....
hey Kevin I was a dodge guy in the 70s 400 and 440 turn over very slow but pretty good motors
If not for this show would never know the word Sheboygan.  Looked up Rocco chiero racing and there is a The Sheboygan Press news article that has his name.
My favorite Iowonians? Iowaniates? Iowanites? Iowas? Anyhow.
Kevin: farts loudly Mook: "go shit your pants somewhere else and on your own time." a few minutes later. Kevin: proceeds to shit his pants.
I just watch the show woww !! build it 😎 i personnally keep the 440 and rebuild the trans!!
Awesome no matter it doesn't move.
Use NGK plugs  .
Are the fenders on the trailer removable?
Get shocked through the weiner, be a man!!
Can say onething I've very some one try to get ground ploy carburetor
Try getting the tires balanced on the trailer. That might move it out a bit.
It is very easy, the oil on the plug insulator is providing a current path to ground until the voltage is high enough to jump the gap.
WIFI sparkplugs, AWESOME. LOL😆
That is definitely a 78 without any mods to dash or fenders grill etc that I saw. You have a complete truck there. Also note not very common on dodge pickups is the lights under the radio in the dash one is labeled fuel pacer I can’t remember what the others are labeled but most pickups didn’t have those lights. Pretty cool.
Blue tooth spark plugs in the 70’s ?
Build it!!! It would be a great series
Hello from Sweden!  About your vibrating trailer... Remove the front pair of wheels when driving empty. Only use the rear pair. It makes a big difference in pulling it.  Greetings!!
Mmm .boltster..My dad taught me just to use a piece of cardboard...just poke the bolts/screws through the cardboard in the appropriate pattern... Free....😁
I may have a new ringtone... bluh bluh bluh!
Got frost bite just watching!!!!
There have been more than a few Jeep Wagoneers that caught fire due that hot ammeter wire! Great video guys!!
Mooks crazy 😜
50 pound weight with a wing on it, just behind the center of gravity will improve things with the empty trailer. I'm sure you got 100s of comments but it helps the metrics.
sponsor junkies are ruining you tube
sounds like the planet grenaded.... Keep that truck away from all the other cars they will catch dodge electrical problems
Thermoquad, the carburetor that punishes you for doing full throttle...  David Freiburger....
i think its really cool the backstory of rocco chiero online a custom car dealer
So, I think I remember a blip on YouTube where Kevin had proposed to Mook.  Of course, I immediately thought he'd knocked her up, right?  Well, that cup of Apple Crown settled any of those suspicions.  Great video guys!  That truck would look great all decked out in Junkyard Digs flash.
Let’s see how it behaves!
Year 1 should have most of the underbody stuff you need. See back then the heavy duty trucks used the same cabs of the 1500s. Fix the bottom and get the trans rebuilt and you’ll have one nice towing rig for stuff
it would be very cool if he fixed this up gave it a bit of restoring and used it to go and get cars for videos and tow them home on it looking forward for that in the future love to see it love your content Kevin.
did you check he rearend? sounds like pinion skipping badly
Cool dog
And usually the fuel filter or blockage and the non working or functional accelerator pump plunger is the downfall of the quadrajet carburetors easy to repair.
Basically most people crank the bolts and screws down to the carb air horn and warp and crack the neoprene polymer fuel bowl carb body and that is usually what is wrong with the thermoquad carburetor I prefer the Carter/Rochester thermoquad and quadrajet carburetors myself.
Crandall Tx 70 with a low of 60 burr so cold 😂
What year is that truck.??  I bought brand new in 1986 a Dodge 1500 4x4 truck with a 318 engine. Very reliable but it ate (used) way too much gasoline, terrible fuel mileage.
THERE IS A NYLON BUSHING   THAT GOSE IN THE LINKAGE
What is that horrible noise in L and D
big mistake  the downshift linkafe will not line up. rebuild the thermoquad !!!!! its NOT A JUNK CARB LIKE THE HOLLEYS R . THEY R ONLY GOOD WHEN THEY R ONTHE FLOOR!
Nice ice crusher!
rear brakes locked/ froze to the drums? that will cause it to back up but not go foward
I screamed with laughter when Mook said I have 2 waters
Keep the 440
Drinky Mook rebuilds just became my new favorite thing
Planetary gearset is exploded. Been there done that, needs a rebuilt or replacement.
Great video keep up the great work 🎉
I'm sorry but the jacket you were wearing in the beginning of the video looks like it hasn't fully rendered in yet and it hurts my brain.
That Dodge has more power in that 440 than a ford or chevy ever had
You two are the most genuine people on yt lol.
a bad or week pick up coil will cause a intermited -no spark mopars use champion  plugs  not ac , exxell or autolite  but champians !
Got a buddy has shit load of cars
The solution to your trailer problem is a gooseneck trailer you will never consider a pull behind ever again.
I don't think it's appropriate to show a young person drunk on you-tube. There are too many vulnerable young people that will think it's cool to be drunk.😞
i have the same parts a full truck if you want it ,get in contact with me ,im in the area close to you
Pumpkin
Dylan McCool should buy that
Yes sir they are the best ones I've ever owned since your recommendation so thank you so much. I chose to get the nice blue pair
Moons rebuild segment was great. Would love of a video on a teardown and rebuild how to sometime.
Great video bud thanks for your time and you have a 440
welcome to junkyard kitties
a 1977 would not have points it would be a electronic ignition  mopar started rat in 1972. i have a early 1972 newyorker it had points
I see why you put a ring on her finger man .
So much fun to watch Mook drunk 🤣
I will buy it from you I need something to pull my duster around on
Kevin’s impression of what the trailer does to the truck, and Mook’s carb rebuild were hilarious, we definitely want more of Mook rebuilding carburetors half drunk
thermoquad was a good carb
Good.jop 🇺🇸❤👍👍👍👏👏👏
Buy a modern dodge and swap the shell's. Then use it as your town pig when you go to get more projects.
What is her name Mook short for? She looks like a margaret!😅
I had something similar happen with one of our mowers at work where the sparkplug wouldn't spark when connected but would when you had spacing from the ground or terminal. I think we determined it was a bad coil but I jank fixed it with a rock so I cant remember (don't ever think I fixed it either so I should do that)
Old mopars love a lot of choke to start!
what size wrinch dose the trailer have on it? a snatch block will double the pull capacity of the wrinch
Getting a car running just enough to ride it around your yard is sort of boring.
Lol yeah missouri is like that every other week
Glad to see Angus participating
ever wana sell it im game lol ;)
I like the Cummings idea something different.
i personaly will take a 440 over a Cummins  anyday . i can work on a 440 i dont know anything about a Cummins  execpt they r used n 18 wheelers & new dodge pick up trucks .
"The cats pooped twice and made leaf piles to bury them in the time it took you to do one hole" 😂😂😂
Subscribe to get keven new pants
Proof that's doing ot Drunk is better
needs new motor and trans lol that thing is clapped
a lot of fun to watch,
great video Kevin as always, I agree with Dylan sell it to him he's got the mopar resources to make it very mc cool
Awesome to see this revival. Not many ramp trucks really left. The carb rebuild part is funny af idk if mook was drunk or not but it was hilarious then you in the background Kevin 🤣🤣🤣. Hope to see the restoration with a 12 valve Cummins swap and a 440 going into something really cool. Keep up the great work and hope to see more content soon
Build it brother. Pls
I live in north Mississippi. You could make a business out of driving rural roads with a trailer and flipping cars. They are EVERYWHERE.
Mook burps better than Kevin farts. Good job on the carb rebuild Mook
Thou Shalt NOT take The LORD Thy GODS Name in Vain......KEBBY....JOHN 3.16  KJV..
😂😂 funny ppl
I just bought some raycons and they sound like s***
Vacuum modulator on trans could be bad .
using that applied mechanics the only way they know how
Your patients are perfect for the old stuff , no computers just test , repeat .
The Dodge RamP
Well Mook , looks like you've recovered after your stink gland surgery . Remember kids , no drinking and wrenching cause you might spill your drink.  Good luck with the Mopar .
The waffle House has found its new host
Replace Dodge cab with Ford cab since you have Ford parts available.
You are starting in secondary ignition instead of primary, I had it happen to my 1994 suburban 5.7L but can’t remember what I did to fix it last year. Good luck with this and happy new year and merry Christmas to you all.
Drunk Mook carb half rebuilds are YouTube gold.
So cut , Dylan McCool a deal
I stopped using champion after I had more then 2 different size plugs have the electrode in the ceramic broke causing a miss fire I couldn't find. Also I want that air pump off it!
I would put a over drive transmission in it and keep the 440 tune it up really good and run it
Those might be blue tooth wires.
Videos with Angus are the best
“Practice makes statistically higher averages” made me laugh out loud. 😂😂😂
Fix the old girl and sell it in barret Jackson auction.
Thanks for another quality video.  Out of all the guys that do resurrections/revivals on YouTube, yours is hands down my favorite channel.
That carb building professional was great.
I've never been so entertained by a drunken carb rebuild......
Guys guys, just get rid of that junk Dodge, just dump it off in McGregor Iowa. Please 😉
That was fun
omg that rig is to die for
WD can with the metal flex hose. Great for tight spots. Edit: How many whiskeys? I mean......rusty looking waters? Please show us the outtakes of the carb rebuild.🤣
I think what makes these adventures so good is the fact you feel like your sat there laughing with them, the humour is great due to the charector of the people
I want it!!! I could make a living with that big girl!
Junkyard digs I have a 4-speed manual you can put in it with your big block I live on the Indiana Illinois state line
Are you doing Hot Rod Power Tour this year?
i kept saying use gas use gas that other not good oct to low
Were you actually drunk doing the carb?? Hahahahahaha
I laughed out loud when you shocked yourself!!  I haven’t laughed that hard in a while. Thank you!!!
This thing is so badass! I hope y'all can manage a Cummins swap on it. Very cool rig with some cool history.
I really hope that that hole conversation is not also your pillow talk lol
half-drunk mook carb rebuild channel ... i'm dying!!! :)
i have that strange spark issue on my 1985 volvo 340, it'll spark with the lead partially disconnected but then wont spark with it fully connected and i dont know what to do about it. if anyone has any suggestions thatd be great lol
"UNNGGH, I got shocked in the wiener." Things I've never heard working on cars before and am now sad that I haven't.
Love mopars but the whole ammeter blah blah is a serious pain in the butt. I always bypass them damn things. Chryslers wiring back then was like a 2nd grade science project gone wrong. lol
Yall should do a 80s suburban
Kevin likes his beer beans way to much does he mook?
Looks like you got some of those bluetooth spark plugs
Iowa: laser flat landscape for miles. Angus: We're on top of this medium sized hill....
There is one of these trucks sitting not to far from my house. It's white and in good condition
Dodges are the reasons you can’t have nice fenders (things).
53:15 - "ziptie moment" missed =))
kevin you need an equalizer hitch they take the sway out and make trailers alot more stable
my first pair didnt work
those ear buds suck
Raycon also makes Everyday Headphones.
Mooks carb rebuild was the best part of this video Great job Mook enjoy your  'water'!!
What I have learned with Champion spark plugs over the years of wrenching and trying to get things running is that they will make you chase your tail for problems that don't exist over and over until you finally realize oh wait its a champion plug no wonder. As a kid I had a great mentor for wrenching on things he taught me almost everything I know and he always use to tell me how much he hated Champion spark plugs and back then I didn't really understand what he was talking about but over the years of hands on experience of my own I now understand and have run in to the problem way more than once. Great video Kevin I enjoy all your videos sorry for the rant.
Nv4500 are all over in Ohio
Once it's running the ammeter should only charge the battery and shouldn't need to be held for contact like that.
Hi junkyaddigs  You bought, took home, got sort of running, but Failed someone will buy,or cut front of it and use as a ramp on the farm for to get under vehicles may be crazy idea's, you will work some deal out
Thanks for the video keeps me inspired and remember Jesus Chrysler drives a Dodge it's a band that's a good 4:40 you need to put that in something cool or not have a great afternoon
Cummins is awesome, but anybody do this same project 😂 Keep the 440 on this RAM would be awesome, maybe with an electric motor on the rear axle to make it hybrid? 👀
@5:57 - call it Prince Harry.
Get her done 91...works every time..........Puddin.
Definitely do the Cummins swap, it's something different and could be some great content for the channel. Keep up the great work
Dodge 440 engine is pretty nice engine
That's arguably the best looking ramp truck I've seen a revival video
See if Westin Champlain wants the damn thing
@10:30 Instructional advice for approaching a Grizzly bear or.. a classic car owner!
Ive had numerous electronic ignition mopars in my life and have NEVER had a module or ballast resistor issue.
When the plug Sparks to the side it means the plug is junk
Dude those trucks are in perfect exterior condition
Cummins swap it and use it as a revival retrieval vehicle!
That winch kicks ass another great video that truck looks cool and remember4:40 just don't fall out of the sky anymore thanks to the video have a great day
OH MAN! Your rescuing a truck i want! lol i gotta watch!
go back for that 67 cougar had one it was a great car 302 ho 3 speed on  the floor best car i ever had and i have owned a lot of cars.
crusher
That's literally my dream truck 😍
A crown apple assisted carb rebuild is hilarious
Champions suck. Put them back in the lawnmower
I have only had one or two plugs that would not spark working on small engines I keep an e3 spark plug those things never die lol
I can tell you from experience to make sure you use the correct trans fluid in mopars. They are unforgiving when it comes to that. You can run the motor with beer instead of oil it won't care lol but use the correct trans fluid
At 1st I thought you parked it on the street but you left it there so I was ??? Do you guys own a road ?
Get an Allison with an adapter plate
you havnt properly introduced the spark plug to the spark plug wire.......its shy..........introduce them properly and it will share spark with the plug
Quick idea for the ramp from the ramp truck. Gut the body on the camper with the Chevy 454 and put the ramp on the back of the camper frame.
Try Car-part for NV4500, they are hard to find, the cores are commanding 1000.00 bucks
I miss my 76 440/727 with 40k. never failed me and drove the block of homes nuts.
Mook fighting with the carburetor while Kevin farts in the background was gold, this is peak youtube
It's a Dodge, therefore dodgy, dig a nice big hole & push it in... xx
OMG!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂 Carbertater rebuild hilarious. Almost as funny as Kevin’s shock to the pee-pee🤣🤣🤣😘
Vice griparage has the same, maybe you can get the parts from him😄
Holding the spark plug wire further away from the plug, or increasing the size of the plug gap only makes it look like there is better spark. There is no increase in energy, with respect to increasing current capacity. All things remaining equal, the available current remains the same. However, increasing the gap to create a wider spark gives the vaporized fuel more space to contact and combust, which is helpful when trying to fire up old or contaminated fuel.
Yep! Sure, it runs on the Thermoquad after sitting that many years, but lets just throw that in the trash instead of rebuilding it, and rebuild a holley instead!
Come on don't give up on it! That would be a great and extremely cool truck. Don't just throw a cummins into it, convert from auto to manual transmission. Maybe even a 6 speed G56 transmission.
Would like to see you bite the bullet and Cummins swap the truck. I think it would be a great opportunity to save this 70’s icon. Enjoyed Mook rebuilding the carburetor.
Angus SOUNDED LIKE THE SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY. 🤣
kept getting distracted by the ford wagon in the background...are there videos on it?!
I am thinking the planetary gear in the trans, left the chat.
30:08 the moment you felt that spark
Hey Kevin you and Mook said that is not stock it's a custom truck so who said you have to use Dodge parts use your Ford parts it's a custom truck anyway make it your own put a Ford Diesel and tranny in it there's nothing wrong with thinking outside the box your friend Tony
Thermoquads are GREAT carbs. Problem is, they do not last very well, between lose throttle blades, leaks and the occasional full on fire, you are better of with a Quadrajet or aftermarket spreadbore. I love my spreadbore's nothing sounds better at full throttle.
13:14 underrated mook joke. “Still has its cats”😂
Mook's "It still has its cats!" gag is low-key the star of this episode.
YES; an episode with farts!!!
You guys should buy, rebuild, and resell old carbs and film Mook rebuilding them with her "water." That would be content gold
Look into a Shocker hitch. That will help your trailer ride. We have one on our gooseneck. It's well worth the price.
Mook was the best!
As soon as you said thermoquad, All I could hear was David freiberger saying it.
All respect to Mook and her skill, and I *know* she's taken, but as a lesbian I'll be damned if her rebuilding that carb is the most attractive thing I've seen today.
That definitely looks like an overweight load for that trailer
Try 24 volts ⚡️
LMFAO. FUNNY VIDEO.
To quote roadkill “thermoquad, the only carburetor to punish you for going full throttle”
😊
No limp d**king the troka
Pull the motor and save!  Hang the grill on a wall and scrap rest!😂😂
I would rather have one of the older trucks. No dodge rams there
Mook is funny when drunk
This is Lean Burn delete it quickly none of them work properly another greater Dodge [person is Uncle Tony's Garage.
I see the reason for the rough running. Both cats are off.
Can’t wait for a new video of that country stationwagon.    Did you drove it after the long roadtrip?
Your problem is the horrible 2 BBL carb and the infamous Chrysler Spark Control System (AKA Lean Burn)  will run light shit and your started solenoids from AMC some Delco as well 1975 or will have two of the most horrible idea Ford Dura spark and Lean burn.were your emissions shit started in 1975
sell it to dylan mccool
Would be great parts and pieces
Exact same pumpkin orange as the one that vise-grip has I wouldn't be surprised if be the same engine in it
Mook rebuilding things while smashed is a channel I would subscribe to
You gotta love the mopar “steal me” junction ignition
We need more Mook rebuilds while sipping on some whiskey! Best part of the video for sure! Thanks for the amazing content!
Hi y’all from west Alabama and hi mook love ya
@ 42:50: Kevin makes parts shopping list. List does not include battery terminals.
This looks like a 225 Slant 6. If this is a Slant 6  or a 318 it will run?
Just look up the meaning for Dodge in the dictionary . enough said . Joking I kinda like Dodge. great video .
I didn't know I had PTSD untill yesterday, when I started watching this. As a kid, my Dad bought a 1971 Dodge Polaris station wagon with a 440 cid in it. He bought it in May, and it worked great untill 41*F. Then for love or money that POS wouldn't start.  My PTSD was triggered by that cranking sound of the starter, because from October to late March that's all we'ld hear. Even Chrysler dealers couldn't get it to start on a cool day. And trust me, they thru every part they had at it!! Luckily one July, my Dad slid into the back of a Tractor Trailer ending our fight with the retched Dodge Big Block.  I still remember 8 MPG, and with a fresh tune up? 8MPG.  8.  8 I said. 8! No wonder this planet hates us.  So glad to see Mook well again. Always fun to see what Crown Royal Apple,  and Fresh Cold Air does to a pretty girl.  Lastly don't try a exorcism on that truck. It didn't work for us, it won't for anyone. Love you guys.
With the abundance of Ford parts, 460 swap it and put a E4OD behind it
What does "lifetime warrenty" actually mean lol?
I don't think DOT would have anything to say about private parties pulling a trailer.
The try, best carburetor rebuild video I've seen in a long time
Might be easier to find a nv5600 out of the 99 up 6 speed trucks
May want to look at the rear end. The truck only smoked when in gear.
That pilot house next to it is not bad looking either
43-50: Drunkyard Mook Rebuilds. Pure Gold.
We love the animals in the videos
классно получил кучу эмоций не забрасывайте проект из него должен получиться крутой трак
You should buy used trucks here in Alabama, Kevin and mook and drive back, to see how many quarts of oil it takes to return to Iowa lol
"I got shocked in the Weiner again" should be  a JYD shirt 😂
Kevin it looks so cold there I live in AZ how do you all live with the cold
That old fargo beside it is a gem !
use a propane torch on those plugs...heat the porcelain up to cherry red n put em back n as quick as u can
Morning's from Nova Scotia, it twas 10 celcius here back Friday the 13th,now today the 15th -2 ,snowing, same scenario. Your videos always great, keep them up,all those old fords,damn rare here at home especially a herd of them. Blessings. Happy new year's
So, the history of what not this hauler is about are cosmetics, but is about the racers and their families that shared their time and energy to "go fast". That should be the focus of preservation of this ride. The two of you have the skillset and the will to achieve this rebuild. Are the "bones" strong enough to create a ride that shares the glory days of the dreams of so many? Stop and think what your have in your hands. The rebuild is your time, energy, and wise expenditures.
Most entertained by you two ever. Mook rebuilding that carb and Kevin just carpet bombing background audio had me in tears. Love your work, love the channel, my Raycons are 2 years old. See ya next week.😊
i own small engine repair shop and i have seen spark plugs with very little use on them and next spring they dont work. the little spring inside the ceramic gets a heat/cool cycle or 2 on them and over winter that spring rusts and is no longer working. i wont say what brand has the most issue with that but bein  a CHAMPION isnt always the answer. by the way i was past ames twice 2 weeks ago on my way to and from my mayo clinic appts. dang lungs and heart causing severe pain and severe shortness of breath at times.
So close................
I would love to see a workshop series of you fixing the trans! 100% would watch/recommend
27:41 That's what she said! 🤣  Mook made it absolutely worth watching as always.
We called it SCROUNGE'N !...Smok'n hitters n cruis'n the back roads listnn to BTO, DEEP PURPLE ,LYNYRD SKYNERD ,UFO ,TED NUGENT..scopn out the ol super bees chevelles fairlanes etc
moook and the carb.... gold!!!!
Another great episode and a good laugh at what happened. Too bad the Truck has too many problems to drive.
i'd never buy raycons watch that dank pods made about them and you know why
I have all the parts necessary to fix all of its problems, just not enough munny to buy it.  If I could borrow the munny from my rich bubbah [I'm pretty sure he would not because he would not approve of it, he's one of those rich people and therefore somehow thinks he is smarter than me] I'd be up there in a hurry.  Anybunny up to partnering with me on it as a project?  That rust is not a problem.
Rewire it like u did ur old Buick
47:08 best shitshow i heard! :) No but honestly, seeing Mook cleaning the carb and goofing around with you in the background where real wholesome. The two of you just are the best!
I'd buy it but I just don't have the munny, OR a way to bring it home.
It sounds like major hard part's going around inside the transmission
Hey Kevin check the rear end. When it goes in reverse it bit the ring gear and drive it pushes out maybe good luck with it
So...nearly 1million subscribers, no Mopar fans.
Yes 👍 ANGUS  so I better prepare for some laughs
International did that with the amp meter on the Scout 80/800
Have you tried letting some air out of the trailer tires when it's empty so the it doesn't bounce over bumps?
Certainly an impressive truck moving over to states soon always planned  to travel around intend building restoring classics
You can swap the carb for a pineapple and i think Mook won't even see t the diverens. She had one to many cup's of water.  Great video guys  Greetings from sam in Holland
Your drive band is slipping.
Kevin, PLEASE Don't Damn GOD.  Nothing is HIS Fault.  Thank you, the Blind Cajun.
30:09 That is what you get for disrespecting Mother Mopar LMAO
I’d like to have that old dodge dump truck next to it
I drove a 72’ Dodge Dart and was driving through a monsoon. The windshield leaked and water got in the dash and the amp meter caught fire. I was lucky to get the fire out. But what a dumb design.
I have owned a few Beavertails similar to this truck, they look great with custom paint and wheels.
can we more of the inebriated carb rebuilds? That was hilarious. Lover your vids!
Call Dalton,.. he just did (3 weeks ago posted) a D-100, same color,... he should have parts, or access to.
30:09  If y'all were curious.  ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ YEEEOUCH!
You need a little mirror. I have one that clips on my shirt pocket. Really comes in handy
sicht aus als währ kublung blatt ng
That ramp truck is badass! I hate cold weather and working in it and watching this made me cold. I am glad you young kids can do it though. Give an old guy like me something to watch. I am going to have to watch your Power Tour 22 video again just so I can warm up.
You must keep it yourself for your own projects
Good vid, Rocco and Roccette
MAN!!  THAT is a NICE truck!
"adults of the corn" -angus ngl angus is ma fav side character
This bad boy looks like it used to haul a race car of some kind or was just a tow truck no matter the case let’s see if this things engine still runs
key word dodge
Mook rebuilding the carb was the funniest thing I've seen in a long time
More ramp truck. Really want to see the inside of the trans.
I haven't been able to watch for awhile....Is Mook losing weight?? She already has to run around in the shower to get wet,,,,EAT GIRL!!! Ice cream/chocolate....
8:22 The icicle hanging out of the rust hole...
the insulation core is cracked
A paper clip also works as a temp jumper for the ballast resistor. Lol.  Ask me how I know lol
Enjoyed!
A quick Google search says that the diagnostic port it's for trucks with lean burn .
This should be the next Olympic event  Drunk carburetor rebuilding  Category's being  Bronze Beer  Silver Whiskey  Gold being moonshine  Using mook as historical reference  Just saying 🤯🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤮😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁🇨🇦😜 Mook drunk  She became growling  Mookster
Mook's voice is a bit DEEP isn't it fellers?🤔🤔🤔🤔
As old peg would say it’s a dodge it has electrical problems
Wow, Rocco Chiero's old ramp truck.  Just think of the cool custom rods that have been on the back of that thing!
Thermobogs solved. Unbolt and toss in woods . Edelbrock and go
Ok. Watching a rebuild of a carb while enjoying adult beverages and Kevin ripping ass probably makes this the BEST video I’ve ever seen. I’m dying laughing! You guys ROCK!!
You guy's might have some Chinese, Champion spark plugs.  Cheap junk.  That 440 runs pretty good.
I spit my coffee on the keyboard. Just shocking. Mopars had what were called "Crying Chrysler starters. Mine did it even after the biggest tractor battery I could find it was a winey little starter .Closing the gap would be less resistance I thought. Good video guys. The cats should get top ratings.
I look at a Thermo Quad like Finnegan. The only carb that punishes you for going full throttle.
This makes me excited to kill my 92 chev.  Motor is going and I wanna finish it
When you can't find the Hole All you have to do is put some Fur around it.
I’m sorry the “Weiner Mobile” shocked you in the pee pee, but it made me laugh so hard that I was weepy 🤣😖
Hello Kevin ,mook and angus
We'd love to see the fails too!! My favorite episodes are the ones that give you trouble, because that's when I learn the most and get the most tech tips which is the JYD specialty! And it gives me stuff to talk about with my grandpa who was a street racer in the fifties. He is always surprised by the tricks I know from these videos that he never told me, and loves going in depth about his own little tricks, so thank you Kevin!
440 out. 440 in challenger. Send it
the later model starters like on the 318 or 360 magnum starters fit and turn much faster
We need more Mook Vids cmon Mook!!
Ah Kevin and Mook you had me in pleats of  laughter throughout this vid and completely lost it in howls of laughter when Mook rebuilding that carb!
I have a question: why people have so many cars abandoned left in their properties? Why they don’t take them to the wreck carriages? They could be useful for some else. I’m asking this as an Italian because here this doesn’t happen
there was one listed on market place in southeast alabama a few days ago
IT HAPPENED AGAIN!
You lost me at cummins swap..  that trucknis so cool I'd love to find something like that local to me.
Damn, if 45:30 to 50:03 isn't the funniest stuff I've seen all week. Thanks JYD and Mook
excellent video Kevin, more Mook commentary please - she's absolutely priceless - sober or pickled 😁😁🤪🤪 love all the meowers too!
Mabey load it backwards?
I love both your channels 👍 u guys r hilarious
I have a great name for this (once it is road worthy), "NACHO CHEESE" given the Orange Paint and Wedge-Shaped Bed.
You can so tell Mook is drunk rebuilding the carburetor
A bit of a sh!t show about 49 minutes in. cuz of fart man.
We need way more drunk Mook segments
You should make another channel where you could put up those unused videos! i think most of us would love to see anything you put out Kevin!
Yes Cummins swap , race hauler, looking forward to this.  !!
Awesome always cool stuff always thanks 😎
Send some of that snow over the pond will you please 🙏
Kevin and Mook  just keep doing what you doing. nice one from the eastern side of the pond in just as cold  United kingdom     Crack on
The old beast is a beauty, shame she's getting a cummins though
You have a cat that have my last name
Mooks one liners are hilarious 😂
Listening to that Chrysler gear reduction starter get a thorough workout, was music to my ears! 😜
THERMOQUAD!! -David Frieburger
New Show: Drunk Mook fixing stuff 😊
I was hoping this would have been a 440 Quad Cab "Service Box" Truck...
Omg drunk Mook carb rebuilds are super entertaining! 😂
I have the feeling Mook was drinking spicey water :D
Poor Mook Kevin can't find the whole, the spark plug whole that is. Sorry couldn't resist.
Put a Ford transmission in behind the Cummins. I'll bet there is already an adapter on that market.
E-brake?🤔
Correct, mopar had electronic ignition in 72, incorrect in thinking they fail all the time, it's not a ford.   I've owned many old mopars and never had a single ignition box or voltage reg failure.   The am-meters can be finicky (as you found) and the alternators are crap.
drunk mook re-building a carb is probably one of the funniest things i have ever seen next only to seeing my sister work on equally intricate things
Great job on the carburetor Junkyard Drunk 😉😘❣️❤️
As someone who fixes pitbikes, yes, sparkplugs can stop sparking withought the fault being the rest of the system
That is a super cool truck. Don't see many dodge ramp trucks, or crew cab dodges,  hope it stays around.
It would be interesting to see a junkyard digs edition race car
mook . best video yet. kevin good push...great video. save the water....a dodge carb rebuild
Oh shit, a 54 Dodge stake! I would kill to have that. I had a 3/4 ton, had to give it up a few years back.
Zip ties and bias plies knows how to fix dodge wiring...
Give it to Dylan  macool
wiki definition of madness 😀😀😀 Kevin knocking on carburetors for over five years 😀 it never, never, never worked ! never !!! 😀😀😀 Pleas don't stop, love your channel !!! 😀
Listening on my raycon that I ordered from your link
Looks like Mook stands uncomfortable close while dragging out the heavy truck the first time?
That space shuttle discovery joke was dark AF, I love it
Time to do some sketchy shit, doodaa doodaa, hope I get away with it, all the doodaa day. - Theme song for the channel
Looking forward to seeing more of this ramp truck. I think it awesome
It's OK you can't win them all
Should listen to your buddy, that thermoquad is very underrated carburetor, with 850. CFM, very small primaries good for fuel economy, and when you hit that four-barrel it will kick ass, often a good cleaning is all that's required! A more modern design than that old  Holley! The pinical of factory carbs! After that it was all fuel injection!      (And no power valve to crap out)
All that beating on the carb, a feller thinks that a Tanya Harding would be a good investment for the old go bag.
Mook that's the first time I ever seen snowflakes my life 90s kid from L.A Cal did see snow
I can suggest a good salvage yard in Iowa! And I can suggest a good BBQ restaurant in Texas that went out of business whose owner bought old car’s. And last thermal carb I saw was over 35 years ago! Only Dodge I owned was oddly enough a 1999 Dodge Quad Club Cab 3500 Cummings Diesel, which would be my suggestion you buy is a running 1999 Dodge diesel truck to put that ramp bed on.
Ha tryna get a new dodge to run after 2 years is harder
Seeing Mook with both eyeballs in the same socket, a lack of coordination, and hysterically sarcastic is making me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You two are funny when you're drunk
I'm a Construction worker in germany, i go to many diffrent houses when I work and I see many different abandoned cars. They're not as cool as american muscles but i've bought a 2005 Jaguar S Type for 750€ and a Golf 2 for 2k!  You're definetly right with going less traveled roads, gems just waiting everywhere!

Great vids as always. Can't you buy WD-40 by the Gallon (5 litre for us) as you can here in the UK? Comes with a spray bottle. Makes soaking cyclinders a lot easier with a syringe and clear tube!
@daylan maccool should buy it and build it
No lie, One of my favorite videos so far. Mook and the carpotato was epic. Keep up the great work!
30:35 that's odd 😂 I would still replace the wires soon
Whenever you read my comment let me know that you got it by saying he shot out of my last name if you want I'm not telling you you have to do it he'll be nice it's pronounced Pits Ford
That carb rebuild was almost better than Mooks hot ones challenge
I'm here for Hobbes, and that Cushman is cool as Hell.
Hey junkyard digs check out Finnegan's garage he has a Cummins swapped ramp truck he might help you out with the Cummins swap if you heard of roadkill he's on it
His son wrote Jun 16, 2020: ''It saddens me to inform everyone that Rocco had passed away in January of 2019. I miss my dad greatly and I thank all of you for starting this post about him. Cars were his favorite thing and the family came in at a close 2nd. Lol. The chopped 84 Cadillac Eldorado is the only car left in our family's possession. If anyone is interested please let me know. Thank you. -Rocco.''
Kevin and mook have so much fun together. It's energising to watch.
Haha you got it! WI-FI ignition cables. They are the only ones in the world !🤣😂
I absolutely love this channel.
Check out Mike of Tennessee jeep works. He recently did a Cummins in a Ram 350 near same age as your truck. Might get lucky.
Love the added cat moments
Of course the wiring and tranny decided to be a massive pile of dodge😂 as per usual
I'm going this again I would appreciate if somebody will let me know if I can hook up a temporary tank to a 88 GMC 350with the early model fuel injection
Bought the Raycons ... Thanks!
I would love to see a 12v in this truck, would probably be a more proper home than my planned 12v swap into a Ford E-series 😂. I don’t know how much a ZF-6 (like what came with the powerstrokes) would cost you but apparently they can hook up to a 12v, presumably with an adapter. I’ll do a little more researching about it and I can let you know what I find if you want. Anywho, amazing video again, Kevin and Mook, hope y’all good time until we see you again in the next video
t looked like a lot of fun rebuilding that carb....drunkyard digs
is it worth a new gearbox at all
Lmfao Mook and the carb rebuild shenanigans 🤣 @Junkyard Digs @Junkyard Mook
Drunk Mook and Kevin are so funny and it's great to see what I'm assuming is a fun evening together just screwing around in the shop. Love the realism of it all.
@28:07 "That's what she said! "
Ohm your spark plugs the resistance through the plugs might be too high 🤔
Best video to date.
She is a runner now with that ballist resistor being fixed 😳 nice strong 440 big block will be a good motor for a race car @Junkyard Digs
We will see
Y'all make a good team.  Funny
Not me screaming at the winch cheering it on to get up😂
This thing is sweet
Do a Ford Cummins swap. Very common. Totally worth it.👌
Tremec has a transmission called TR-4050 apparently it is supposed to be direct replacement for nv4500.
That is bizarre the spark works away from the spark plug when you put the wire on the plug no spark very odd some very high resistance in the plugs Maybe @Junkyard Digs
How much do you want
Idea for a new show ... Drunk Carbatator Rebuilding with Mook
I still say free cardboard is better than any percent off boltster.  Been using cardboard for decades and it's free.
I recently bought a 1972 D300 cab chassis with the 400, in similar condition. It has the same lights on the front valence but a different grill. Still using points and a Holley 2 barrel. Would love to see you guys do a cummins swap in this truck; I think it would be approximately the coolest thing ever.
First time watching your channel I have to admit it It's a great video I will watch more, but thanks for  entertainment
You guys are funny when y’all are drunk 😂 definitely need to do that more lmao
When Junkyard Digs uploads I will stop whatever I am doing and watch
Question for Mook here: When Kevin charged his winky with spark, did it get more powerful? .... Asking for a friend.
Lol at the Ram charger dash badge with the Doors having the adventurer badges @Junkyard Digs
You need a new transmission
The fromt clip the grill and headlights remind me of a old ram charger nice big block 440 @Junkyard Digs
Stop fucin about and put some start ya bastard down carby
Champions are the worst plugs on the market.  AC Delco are the second worst.
Laughing my ass off  During the carburetor Rebuild ..... Mook did a good job
On the bright side, it proved that if you drive a Dodge, you should always carry a spare transmission
hate to be the guy but wheres the update on the Limo D:
FYI A/C stands for Arthur Champion. They both (A/C & Champion) were started by Arthur.
I can’t wait to see the Cummins swap, I know you don’t do much diesel stuff but I do enjoy watching you work on them as you learn more I do aswell I have a 69 ford f-100 bump side it’s got a 390 in it it’s a sport custom my dad gave it to me and ever since then I’ve watched you work on big and small block fords with all the carb tuning and everything else you do it has really helped me with most of things I’ve done and it really helps in my mechanics class as well 48:01
Oh man, that poor winch, lol.
Finally a proper pile of junk!! Sweet score!!!
Kevin its a mopar you are gonna have an "8 starter adventure "
And life smells
I think you may need to buy a wider trailer There Kevin but I'm impressed you got that big old girl on that trailer @Junkyard Digs
The pine straw is extra filtration
Whose idea was this??? 🙋‍♂️ classic
Be advised of the Old Mechanic's trick. Badly fouled plugs can be restored with a propane torch. Hit them with the tip of a hot flame until the electrode glows red. Takes about 5 minutes. Hold the opposite end metal tip with locking pliers. It works. Used that technique many years to recover many very badly carbon fouled lawn mower plugs until I got around to replacing the carb. They would foul after two mowings.
Nice plan so get ramp truck back to shop big block in car Cummins in truck to haul said big block car Ehhhhh mate let's make Fire 🔥 😎 sounds like a great plan  @Junkyard Digs
4:30 : Drunken carb rebuild. What could possible go wrong? "The Jetsons are doing fine."
Bad coil
Need to change the plug wires and auto lite plugs
Call Mc Cool.. he will love it!
You need to stop playing around... get a 40' tilt deck gooseneck.
Crown apple and sprite baby
how much for that thermalquad
30:36 Ok that’s, _What the fuck_
Reverse uses the rear band and the direct (high) clutch pack.
Kevin you and Mook have a beautiful house and property and congratulations on your successful business
If you want a ramp truck, take the ramp off the dodge and fit it to one of the many hordes of F trucks you already have. I think you hurt this dodges feelings ;) You know the dodge will break you if you keep it.
Love it man. You may go broke with a Mopar, going that route. Itd be cool as hell, and an ongoing small project at a time kinda thing for 5 years..... But look at ole Finn. That Cummins swapped Squarebody he has/had? was cool
Can we see more of Mooks Whiskey Carb rebuild's, best part of the vid 🤣keep up the good work 👍
The place you bought that truck... Was it some kind of ancient burial ground?
Need a jyd and westen champlin video
lol, I did an article on that rollback a decade ago.
HEY !!! STOP saying the word GD !!!
Hey Kevin, the VIN on every vehicle has the year of said vehicle in the letter and number sequence. I believe that it would be the 6th digit on that truck.
You can use a 96+ chevy nv4500 and just swap the input shaft and bell housing. That and the chevy 2wd nv4500s font have the dodge 5th gear problem. You can also use 95 and older chevy nv4500s, however you will need to turn down the input shaft bearing retainer to fit in the older case and drill two holes to mount the bellhousing. That is what I had to do with my 95 nv4500.
Fuseable link off the starter solenoid powers the dash and ignition system  when they blow is shuts down all your power to the system
Mooks carb rebuild was absolute gold, had me laughing the whole time. Love it!
Kitties! 😻
That clunking noise sounds like the carrier Bearings are shot or atleast one of them are & the transmission is shot also & hello Mook I see your feeling better than you were when you were working on your red & white truck with your brother & Kevin  when you had your appendix taken out
I liked Mook's Carb Clinic.
I wonder if it has a 2 speed rear axle he was just destroying because it wasn't fully in gear. Lol.
“It happened again!” 😂😂😂 sorry but that was too funny
"More on this later". (He said moron, heh heh.)
If I remember correctly, that is an 8x6.5 bolt pattern on that truck and you can get modern one ton or 3/4 ton. Second gen dually rims on there if I remember correctly
I really enjoy watching your videos thank you for the work you do to make them
“Strange world, lotta smells 🤷🏻‍♀️” 😂 Amen!
A deckover trailer is what you need for this sort of load.
The Cummins swap would be sweet. I have a 2wd NV4500 sitting in my shed but I’m in south Alabama.
"Carpotator"? Really? Everyone knows thats a "fuel make it happener".
Thermo quads are good if u know how too  work on the the dionaugnisct port if i rember right some of the old sun osilo scopes had differnt pig tails for differnt cars and trucks
One of the main problems I have with Chrysler products is that when they won't start (most of the time) the starter sounds like it's going hahaha Ha HahaHa
12v swap for the win !!
That's a qell known truck you got there. I wouldn't ne in a hurry to sell it.
Love to see yall be your fun self's if it ain't fun why do it ?
Never see old quad cab dodges.
Sell the Motor...
get you a section of rubber line that will just fit over the tube on your wd can then you can just use the hose to put in the spark plug hole. love watching yall work when i have time yall are doing the things some of us wish we had time to do keep up the great entertainment.
Ok so I’ve never seen an actual snowflake until this video! Cool old ramp truck, snowflakes… yeah I feel complete
Those noises are absolutely terrifying
Do you ship to new Zealand ???
Just run the 4x4 trans and tcase and get the low range.
that was the funniest damn carb rebuild I've ever seen, after I wipe my tears, where's the kitchen so I can get a koozie
I pull the same exact trailer... and it pulls like shit.. I've dragged a lot of crap home with that trailer
Dylan McCool had entered the chat
Ummmm, you HAVE to get that cougar! I got my first car 4 years before mook was born, and it was a 68 cougar. Beautiful machines.
If for whatever reason you decide to not keep the truck I'd love to see Dylan end up with it.
I don't like the Holley power valve thing.
Most entertaining carb rebuild ever and you shitting your pants 88 times during the rebuild had me roll'n haha
Sounds like rear-end
If you are going to try to incentivise Mook, it probably will need to be Leinenkugels or possibly St. Pauli Girl. Not Mississippi River Water Light.
17:30 : I was expecting the distress call to Dylan McCool.
I love how he is so fun and doesn’t slag off brands
Looks like the perfect vehicle for Dylan McCool...
I love the old Dodes! Especially that crew cab. The 440 makes it even better.
Another great video as always absolutely love this channel, that dodge is pretty cool and badass and not something u see everyday keep up the great work as always and god bless from Rochester NY
Put a Ford motor in it
Holy shit a Rocco Chiero
This would be a pretty cool and interesting car hauler if you decide to get it running and rust free. Repaint it to JYD colors and branding.
Chrysler used a gear reduction starter. Since you already cranked it first spray WD40 down the carb while cranking vs in the plug hole.
Air brakes?
First the magical spark plugs then mook's carb rebuild show. I'll never be bored watching your videos!
10:02 That Cougar needs some JYD luv!
I was waiting for the Dylan call xD
To keep a Dodge running all you need to do is keep a Dodge service center worth of parts in the back aka Moparts 😁
Oh my goodness kevin that’s funny lol
Running or not, it was fun hanging out with You and Mook. Love your videos. Keep up the good work.
If you keep it, can you name it the Rank Truck?
if I had a nickel for every time Kevin got shocked in the pecker I'd have two nickels Which isn't a lot but its weird that it happened twice
Ol Hobbs was giving the ramp truck a cat scan lol.
What Chevy ?  I must of missed an episode guys sorry
Hot up Dylan McCool! That would fit right in with his mopar colection
a very hot coffee and sigh... know its a big motor.
As a fellow whiskey (and sometimes beer) drinker, I want to hang with drunk Mook! LOL.  You two were having so much fun that night. LOL. Hilarious!  Be safe!
Couple more year you’ll be a pro … lol ha ha 😂👍🤣😝😉
Just do the tranny. 😂
Mook looks younger than 27
We’ll if no spark at top of plug Porcelain must be cracked or broke with it being so cold and years of sitting lil brake Kleen will help resolve that issue or just replace them with hood used or new ?? Which ever you prefer
Kevin do you want to sell it!? I've been looking for a big block dodge ramp truck!!! The trans noise is the sprag exploded.
You drive me crazy! If it does not try in the first 3 seconds the next 30 seconds are a waste of battery and time. Quit doing the 30 sec cranks!!!!
Dodge ignition systems are not the strongest
put air suspension on the trailer
Send the thermo quad to Dylan. Don't throw it away. Love seeing the Apple induced MOOK!!!!!
Probably had something to do with the plug resistance.
Good eye on the ballast resistor 👀
“I got shocked in the wiener” “It happened again!” The funniest thing I’ve heard!
Omg drunkish mook is the best!!
Holley Mook 👼
Hi love the show. Do they ship ear buds to australia?
Laughed a lot at this one 🤘 you guys know how to have a good time 😂😂
People often say why does Mopar have to be so dead set on being different from everyone else well it’s simple Mopar is hot garbage always has been always will be, sure nice looking bodies on the cars but everything else complete and utter dog shit
Okay A I want that Cougar you saw on the side of the road (bucket list car, one day I'll get one) B another channel I watch a guy had the exact same issue with the Amp meter wire and while he was driving it shorted out and almost caught the truck on fire.
Cool
I've heard it called jump fire. Loosely fit wire on fouled plug and idk, somehow makes it fire.
Every episode should have mook drunkenly rebuilding a carb, great content
I know thats notta ‘70’s steering wheel, looks like the same one that was in my mothers ‘83 d150
awesome solution solving. especially on the go.  boy if that ways my partner "would have a melt down". like she loose her crap. then i become compromised . bravo
The only dodges that don’t have a bad transmission are the ones that just left the dealer with a new transmission. Even then .. Trans is bad .
Drunk carb rebuild.
It needs a dial shifter
" Permanent pliers " ? .. Love the dig at the dope who moved to Tn ....
Love ur content ❤
If everyone had an orange tabby, there would be world peace.
Can you guys pleas do a Volvo 240 revival
Old Dodges never die,they just burn up from the wiring issues.  Lol. Great video buddy.
I could watch "Drunk Mook", rebuild something every week.  It would hard on her Liver but it is great entertainment.
Every successful car guy must have a ramp truck at least once .
Always good to see Mook
its a new year, so say nothing. god bless mick australia )
No save the Thermo Quad please! 🙏
Try dealing with a 2007 Dakota with the 4.7 that's a lot easier to get to
Crown Apple and Busch perfect work evening.
I'm missing out on my 54th day today. 😊
Oppp. I confused this with a zip ties and bias plies video.. then i yawned and found something else to watch.
In North Carolina this Wednesday and Thursday it will be 65 degrees
Sitting here drinking some Jim Beam and Bush beer cause I cant sleep, laughing my butt off! 🤣
trans sounds like a blown up 4l60.
It sounds like the planetaries have said bye.
That sound at 6:26
Perfect companion for life!
Angus!!!!!!  I was just wondering where he went the other day!   That is all, execute the POD.  Edit: That was not all. Looking at that truck with a FL perspective, I can't believe that it sat for more than a week given the lack of wildlife growing on it. Also, obligatory joke about Kevin not finding the hole even after using his finger <insert joke here>. (Does that help K-Scruff?)
Professional Holley mechanic, Junkyard Look! 🧐😉
Never been much of a Dodge or Mopar fan so my response would be better left where you found it.
“We do have engineering degrees so there’s that” favorite quote from the video😂😂
Awesome truck…..had a ‘74 ramcharger 4x4 full convertable bout 20yrs ago, it had a cammed 360 and ran like hell…..just didnt have reverse so you had to be very crafty with your parking jobs…..i didnt have much money back then , but damn i wish i woulda kept that beast!!!
People who yell at Kevin for using brake clean are going to be even more angry at me because I've used Tyre shine, it worked a treat
Champion plugs are junk
I too, have been shocked in the weiner. That is not a pleasant experience  😆
I used to run carter thermoquad on my 302 Cleveland and they are fire breathing junk
Go back and get that cougar😄
You are correct.  It's a 67 Cougar.... probably an XR-7
As ziptiesandbiasplys would say looks like you got second hand dodge eletric problems.
This video would likely be Mike Finnegan approved!
Great video...BTW, I LOVE MY RAYCONS! Got 'em because of Junkyard Digs!
Do you still have the green big block dodge? Is it for Sale?
problem is you get off the main roads then everyone thinks their junk is like gold ,,,, the one that got me was an old 73 chevy with a western plow on it but that thing looked like the salt king got to it too , this was like 1995 when i started asking they wanted a 1000 first then 4 years finally got em down to 500 when i gave up well a bunch of years later i was telling a friend about it and loll and behold he bought it for 150 the year after i quit asking , that day i quit asking was the day i quit buying and now days wow it's worse yet a car a truck totally smashed up busted up totaled out from 1000 to 50000 why i mean really why a rust bucket needs some tlc 10000 obo but it needs 5000 more to drive really really used right used mini bike 3 hp b&s no breaks its an old baja big tire 600 or 700 new at tractor supp but fb cl they want 300 to 600 really and to think of cost to get riding yeah , really
No run without that.
Mopar geek here nice to see you get it running and hopefully someone gets to you on that transmission. if not maybe Mccool wants a ramp truck, either way another fun Video thanks for sharing.
My dad had a 73 dodge club cab. Sadly he had a heart attack while driving it and passed away.  The truck was totaled. Just the sound on that engine cranking brought back a flood of memories. The sound is identical.  Most of my auto knowledge came from wrenching on that old truck.
Runner!
Fire in the big block.
How is Dylan McCool not all over this thing if you are deciding to get rid of it?
Weiner sparks hilarious!
There you go
Noise sounds like flex plate
Work that throttle
Crazy
Need a nv5600 behind that Cummins a lot stronger and a lot better gear ratio
Thats normal full old Mopar starters, whiners. Give it a cleaning. That trany prob just needed a drink of Lucas.  Drive in reverse to heat shit up but I think I heard the converter.
I would love to see a Cummins swap and the amount we could learn from it would be astronomical
Thanks!
Your luck is terrible.
is there a trick for the code for the ear buds?  im getting Enter a valid discount code or gift card
Whats Mook's favorite whiskey?
47:08 haha you guys are hilarious
Red solo cup rebuild on a carburetor we've all been there before
Beautiful and the oil or better yet WD-40 won't cry plugs as much and water killer plus lubricant. Awesome
I live in Southwest Wisconsin (grant county, only about 45 mins from dubuque IA) and a guy in the town near me has literally acres of old dodge parts.  we went there when we needed a 727 transmission for our old d100 when i was in high school.
We need to see this happen in the end you will have 1 awsome truck and this is comen from a die hard ford guy either way ill be watching
Fun stuff!
Impressive infomercial on the ear buds , sold.
When are we gonna see the tear down on the ford station wagon.
I know where there is a 93 or 92 dodge d250 Cummins automatic 2wd sitting
😛😛❤❤❤❤🦾🦴🦾🦴👍👍👍👍👍👍
I really hope you all had a great Christmas an new year.. please wish me luck to. I will not get scammed this year but a you tuber. I'm trying to get a car or car or van. To to a road trip.
Hey Kevin I had a 57 Chevy years ago that had a completely rebulit 327 in it.  We sent it to the body shop they had it for three months.  It wouldn't run when we got it back we had to have it towed home. We sent to an mechanic/racecar builder friend that had for an hour.  I asked him what he did he said the new champion plugs went dead. He also said he always ran autolites or ac delco. Last time I ever used champion.
Kevin,in the early to late 70s I was a school trained Ford dealership mechanic.  Although I worked in a Ford dealership we worked on anything that was brought to us and found the short-comings of the thermoquad card. In short the phenolic portion of the carb would warp if undo heat was found in the engine compartment than you just had a big vacuam  leak. I have always turned to holley as an alternative carb. they are easy to rebuild and adjust. After I got tired of being a slave to Fords 16 buck an hour wage (at that time) I went racing crazy and that was the end of that tune. By that time I had gotten my Mechanical engineering degree (automotive) and had other opportunities offered to me. 😎 🏁
Thank you!!!   Great video!!!
I like the 54 or 55 1st series next to the ramp truck!
That ac Delco plug is probably an rts xxxx plug meaning it has a resistor in it and the dodge needs higher resistance for proper spark witch explains all your issues. Coil is breaking down due to not being able to unload properly
Thanks Kevin I love my raycons
Clean  , clean , clean. Nope replace the plugs
Junk
Sounded like the shuttle discovery!!! And the sound! The sound! 😂😂😂😂
More Mook *drunk* carb rebuilds please... :D
You can do it WD 40.then fresh plugs=zoom.
I had a auto shop teacher that got his ring finger stuck behind the dash on a Chrysler product at the amp gauge and burned his finger so bad they had to remove it,,, Happy New Year guys
Good to know I’m not the only one who struggles with a tilt deck and a cheap winch battery😂👌🏻
Hobbs is awesome 🤗
Awesome Truck
Awesome, Thermo Quad.
I will get in the truck say that cat to Kevin.
JYD Hi-Vis beanies??
Sell it to Dylan Mccool
really rare truck, probably worth some big money if you were to try and restore the old moter to "factory" running condition. (but it's a dodge). Love the videos, also wanted to mention that the truck looks really clean for a northern truck, and I'm from Florida so seeing rusty trucks and comparing them with the cars down here are interesting.
Kevin, you need three lighting instruments. A "key" light and a "fill" light in the front, and a "backlight" to light the back of her head, from behind... That's called standard three-point lighting for television.
My book if you got a Ford engine and trans put that in there Ford Mopar. Racers do it Chevy Ford ect
LMC truck is a good source for parts, would love to see a build...or ship it to Dylan McCool...would like to see somebody do something with it and appreciate it, these are hard to come by.
I think you're flexplate is broken.
For real, let's all agree that this thing looks sick.
So Mook 's real name must be Ashley? Kevin called to her by that name in this video
great video as always. If I bring the booze can rebuild a carb with you guys? 🤣
Crown Royal and carbotaters...next time Mr Jameson visits me. I'm gonna adjust my timing. 🤣🤣🤣
16:43 Jeep/ AMC did the same thing with the main power through an AMP gauge I "deleted" it on my 77 cherokee. Love the Chanel and keep up the good work!
Ford swap the dodge. Parts problem  solved .
Ta da and happiness is being you all😉.
Well the part that Mook fixed actually worked perfectly so it's all Kevin's fault! Just Joshin'. 😍
Okay, drunk carburetor rebuilding ought to be an Olympic sport. And farts will never not be funny.
Mook missed the perfect opportunity to give a “missing the hole” joke! Lol
Does anybody know how much he paid for it
More Mook Carb Rebuilds please.
Welcome to Drunk Carb Rebuilds with Mook.
We don't have any like that you are enjoying there.
Far out that's the kinda weather I love. Miss the South island of NZ.
Reminds me they used to sell these spark plug non-foulers to keep them from fouling. It was just a metal housing threaded inside that would extend the plug back further than normal, and it had a small hole in the center of the closed end, you would screw the plug into it, then screw the whole thing into the spark plug hole. So, it would keep your plugs from oil fouling. Basically the same concept here, increasing the spark I guess.
Do as Kevin he is a professional and Mook supervising, no problemo.! 🧐😉
That carb rebuild was pure gold.  Thanks for the laughs.
Jan 10th in Eastern IA I was outside working on a snow blower & sanding a wooden Bluetooth speaker box while wearing a t-shirt and shorts! It was in the low 50's which for an Iowan basically means shorts weather again!
How about an auto trans episode? They're not that difficult.  You could rebuild the 727. Lots of used parts on Ebay,  give it a try.
Friday 13th Strikes Again!!! Don't give up, seriously, don't :o)
Block it up your going to get it done.
Rocco Chiero. I believe that it wants to give you a hard time.
Frozen to yard, LOL
Wifi spark plugs 😲
Love the vids man always have but raycon doesn't compete with the every day scull candy earbuds they last 45 hours on the case charge and 10 hours on the earbuds they don't fall out and have way better quality sounds as well as 65 feet of wireless before distortion and the case is smaller and only 45 bucks
That needs a Cummins! You can Do it.
Thank you for bringing Pole Barn Garage on to your channel and recommending him . Since the last video I have binged many hours of his content including the entire Holey Goat playlist. Very underrated channel.
Wow your all younger than I thought, awesome to see you all doing this stuff. Great evening to you 5!
Great video and sweet ride brother!
You could’ve filmed half of us and it would’ve been better!
I Love this truck if i were currently in a cash position i would gladly make a offer to buy it. Hope to see you put the Cummins in it.
Forgot to mention... this is the truck from my favorite TV show from the 70s  EMERGENCY   search EMERGENCY from  the 1970s   This truck was the star of.the show
Hi every one. And good luck.
The bench seat is the second bed.
I love the Chanel and I love you both I think your Relationship is Fucking Amazing 👏 Mook you are A cool Ass Chick Not only do you have the Looks but your personality is Live and fun and all kinds of good things. Ohh one more thing... BUCKETS 🪣 Will there be more Buckets 🪣  in future videos???
Why don’t you switch cabs and put a Ford cab on it
Contact Scott's Speed Shop.
That’s what you call Wi-Fi spark ⚡️ plugs
It be a great project. Crew cab dodge trucks like that are hard to find. I'd keep it original but get rid of the hauler bed and make it a regular flatbed.
@30:06-30:15 put your playback speed on 0.25 ...zap-zap-zap 🌭
Find another cab to put on it and use it as the junkyard digs car picker upper
You have all thos ford parts put a ford motor and trany in it.
Kevin the idea of Cummins swapping that and 440 swapping a car would be bad ass bro. Probably viral and it would be so awesome
Kevin..  been watching  since the beginning..   Brother you had me in stitches today... you, Mook and Angus are awesome...   Love u guys..  Adam
“The only carb that punishes you for going wide open throttle”
You need the throttle to work and use it air fuel clowns 🤡
It’s not a total disappointment Kevin. Mook rebuilding a carb half in the bag made it this video 🤣. That trans sounded like a dryer full of quarters 😁. I was kinda shocked you did a video on a Dodge but I guess there’s a first time for everything. Engine still  sounds strong even after sitting for as long as it did. Cool looking truck for the decade. I’ve only seen one in my lifetime living in New Jersey and it was black. Not a popular transport vehicle in my neighborhood. Too big for city streets. Perfect for Iowa roads. 👍Watch the family jewels next time Kev, you want children someday don’t cha!!! 😂
cats on the internet. Likes video.
Speaking of limo PLEASE do some kind of 24 hour challenge in it or like maybe just drive it.
Bro said we are getting bombed right in front of a vet😂😂
Trok
Drunk Mook rebuilding the carb was absolutely hilarious. Thanks for the video!
Mongoose and Snake had matching Dodge Ramp trucks for their Funny Cars way back in the day, I remember seeing them at OCIR or the Winternationals when I was a kid back then. Might be worth looking at if you want motivation. Lotta work ahead if you do jump in to it.
Shoot keep an eye out for a 70 chevelle
I hate to say I think the back axle is going out it was smokeing real bad right there  just my theory
Air brakes are locked up. You need air.
Dylan has a Monaco that needs an engine would be good to have the two of you put an engine in his car
Mook sounds like a drunk trailer park lady named Terry working on her trans am lmfao
I lost it at the carb rebuild segment
WD40 is good at keeping things from rusting for a little while, but it's really NOT a great lubricant for cylinders. You'd be MUCH better with a splash of mystery oil mixed with some 3in1 sewing oil in a spray bottle.. only need a LITTLE bit of it to coat the walls and you'll be in MUCH MUCH better shape than wd40 garbage..
Sweet truck I push air inside of my WD-40 cans and other cans like it an air compressor and air nozzle when they get low like that just pop the caps off carefully
Well Champion plugs are junk I no they have been junk my how life an that's over 50 years so if I buy something that has a champion plugs in it I put it in the trash an put a NGK if its a automobile for a Chevy I would use AC it its a Ford I would use Motorcraft
The carb rebuild had me in stitches!  Do tell, how did Mook here her nickname?
Everyone says to use champion on mopar...I have always used autolite without any issues...in fact I've had them carbon together, and still spark well enough to run smooth...and yes, I have seen many block heaters on chrysler Big Blocks mainly 440's due to the nature of the hard start slow crank cold weather conditions. Chrysler big blocks are hard start anyway. The thermoquad isn't a bad carburetor. I once had a factory chrysler manual that specified to back off the Idle screw completely before adjusting the accelerator pump, adjust by bending the linkage, measure the post from the top of the carb, adjust until it is between 1/2 inch and 9/16...measure to the bottom of the camphor from the top of the carb/ base of the accelerator post where they meet. Did this to mine, and it was extremely responsive...
You outa make it a resto mod with the 12 valve and an Allison Trans beings they do make an adapter plate for the combo
Not to be a crepper but I just so happen to know ur location. My past jobs have taken me by ur place before. Not worry ur secret is safe lol
You need  to go to a steal yeard
Does that bolt mat work for sand blasting?
As heavy as that bastard is, you could've probably gotten it home WITHOUT tying it down. Lol.
Put a small block Chevy in it, SBC goes into anything.
my only theories regarding the spark issue, is A: the ignition module NEEDS resistor type spark plugs. Or theory B: the coil is on its way out and will only put out a minimum of 10kV
Mistake buddy, that dodge is pre ram vintage
Cummins swap would be really cool! I'm also currently looking for a 2wd 5SPD for my first gen cummins lol
Had a Charger I  drop shifted into drive & broke the oneway-clutch in the trans. Drive stopped working (No opposing force for the forward drive to work against. Low drive uses the reverse drive instead one-way clutch to work against. so It became a semi-automatic car. I believe drive worked when you got to it. I also think I needed to leave off the gas as well when shifting to the higher gear. Although I may have done so the effect of shifting seemed real. I was a teenager!  so all may not be lost, I drove mine for months 66 miles a day 6 days a week.
Maybe Dylan McCool wants it
I would buy it
That trans is trashed
Nevermind u figured it out
Why'd you let go that coil wire bro
REAR END IS BUSTED. I HAVE LOTS OF PARTS
If the amp gauge wire is broken you won't have power to gauges or ignition
Yaaa it ran
USE SOME TWO STROKE 92 OCTANE and if needed some starting fluid, don't burn up that old starter, and get some good battery's by the way I wouldn't like that bill, battery's, anyway I love your content or should I say your Show, who Knows, Thumbs Up!..... Thanks......
I think I would check my drawers if I were you? lol
Champion suck get different plugs and it will run
Hello from New Zealand
So at 23:30, oil burner mechanic me needs to jump in and mention that carbon conducts electricity. If there is buildup of carbon it will allow the spark to travel across to ground at the base of the plug instead of between the electrodes ad intended. The spark will travel the path of least resistance. Any crack in the porcelain, any buildup of carbon that will allow for the circuit to be completed more easily than by jumping the plug gap, will result in a loss of spark, just as it will in an oil burner on a furnace or boiler with dirty or incorrectly set electrodes, or cracked porcelain insulators.... except in riello burners because their spark is generated by some weird DC rectified current that isn't bonded to any other part of the burner... so the spark will only ever either jump between the electrodes, or not happen at all.  ...and that is my semi-on-semi-off-topic, long-winded tangent for today.
Drunk Mook is the best Mook.
Pull the bed off and put it on another truck.
That carb that Mook work on did it tipes  run  or run skrate 😂
you need that on the channel take your time fix and make something custom and cool
Hi
Kevin uses brake clean like peg uses Cosby sauce 😂😂😂😂
There was so much cat in this video  =)
Newest fav saying, "Strange world, lots of smells." Thanks Mook🍁
A little big of plastic would of helped you
Kevin it sounds like the PTO is halfway engaged if it has three driveshaft then it's probably a PTO halfway engaged or if it has a four-wheel drive PTO transfer case it's possible one of the gears are broken and Mook needs one of the big kids sippy cups for her water LOL you two are great together y'all are awesome
You guys are setting a bad example for the Gen-Zers watching...  Doesn't bother me any though, I'm old as the hills and I think y'all are funny as hell!  Reminds me of when my car friends and I would get together to get something fixed/modified/broken worse.  Note:  there are very few good surprises when you're working on something that has been sitting for over 20 years!
Dodge's r cheap made piece's of junk. They need to be in the junk yard.
Always carry a spare ballast resistor or two in the glove box pf a Mopar. You will need it.
0:14 will you do the truck next to it
Love you guys all together. Just so much fun on these.Videos. Thank you for sharing!
Watching mook half drunk rebuilding a carburetor is hilarious. “Don’t hurt that I can see three of this bolt.” 😂😂😂
He said it happened again 🤣🤣🤣🤣 think you'd learn after the first time you shock your 🍌
“Go sh** your pants somewhere else and on your own time!” Spat my drink immediately 😂
Just remember MoPar's use ATF+4 GM/Ferd ATF is NOT Good in a MoPar.
My first vehicle was a 73 power wagon 200, 16 years old, 318 bored over. 060, cam, intake,  headers, flowmasters, 4x4, I loved it, cb , push bumper, gun rack
hey I noticed the ford wagon with no reverse lol its still there!!!
It's all shits and giggles, until someone giggles and shits.
I don't wanna complain...but I'm going to. This is the commercial-ist channel I watch. A commercial every 2:30-2:45 makes it tough to watch.
rocco sadly passed away in 2019, according to his son.
Starting old trucks that have sat a long time and especially are in the very cold weather a propane torch goes a long way. Actually a Tiger torch and a big metal pipe will do wonders underneath the engine for 20 minutes in cold weather to make the oil get warmer and thinner to let the engine rotate.
Love your content. Keep up the great work
Kevin: “where’s the hole?”  Me: 😂😂😂😂😂
I may be an idiot, but I never had any luck with Thermo Bogs.
Y'all are fukn hilarious. Great show. Keep up the good work Do you have man size march? 6xl tall
One thing you should check is the trans filter. Now I could be remembering wrong but something Mopar did back in the day was use fiber filters instead of a strainer type setup. This could possibly be important because he said that the filters don't like sitting and over time will break down, this ends up being an issue because it can lead to the filter clogging after you try to get the trans to move. I could be remembering wrong and acting like an idiot, but if I'm remembering right then of course a Mopar would have this issue.
Sounds like a broken sprag.
January 10th! My birthday! :)
I’ll take that piece of walnut you got there
727s are really easy to rebuild so do that and put a a few hundred into it and you got yourself a hauler! You can get some good money for a 440 ramp truck!
Champion plugs: The Harbinger of the Apocalypse.
Actual penatrating oil works alot better for loosening up sticky engines.
OMG Kevin how could you let Mook rebuild a carb while drunk? Lol it was hilarious to watch but jeez no wonder it doesn’t work lol
The nv4500 is completely overrated! Get yourself a ZF5 or ZF6! They're much more modern heavy-duty transmission, aluminum case and the ZF6 has an oil pump and a factory oil cooler setup!! They usually came behind Ford engines but you can get a factory Ford to Cummins adapter plate and clutch setup for them. I built the Chevy truck with a 4bt and a ZF5 using all factory components to bolt them together.  ZF > NVG
Nice vid mook is the best ps ware is the booger scope
I would love to see a cummins swap . But pretty sure the cab is shot . Can't wait to see what happens
I'm not gay but Angus makes me feel things
From my experience, DO NOT RUN CHAMPION PLUGS IN A DODGE!! I had the same issue. When I used AC or Mopar plugs it ran as good as a Dodge can ... lol ... fyi I am a Chevy guy so I am compelled to give Ford and Dodge people crap ... it is all in fun. Please don't hate me for it ... 😜
That's true it is hell in Minnesota.
Very KOOL truck Would be a Great build
I love Angus.
Could the diff be the problem possibly?
Dang your getting very close to 1 million subs
0:06 stopped watching the video just about every YouTuber has one guy that some people don't like and in this channel it's angus that guy I really 100% don't like
Please build this. I would love to see the Cummins swap and the 440 mopar car combo
"OH it still has its cats" IM DEAD 😂😂😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀
I have a new goal in life: spend an evening with Kevin and Mook while drinking and rebuilding carburetors.
this video is goofy and its amazing!! JYD gives laughs when one needs them most!
Almost sounds like torque converter, but also almost sounds like the rear end. Take a look at what the driveshaft does.
Glad it took a bit of cranking , something about that mopar starter sound gets me 🥵
👍
Personally I think you need to take that carburetor off if you want to call it a carburetor stickers on the ground unusual Sledgehammer on it because that's all it's good for then turn around and get your good Holley carburetor preferably in double Pumper like a 750 or 850 Holley because that's what you're going to need   P.S  I HAVE TO ADD LOL 😂 🤣🤣🤣 Mook you're funny very entertaining!!!lol
8:13 liiike a gloove
That AC-Delco plug is probably one with a built-in resistor, should be able to find similar plugs that'll fit! Drive is junked but low works, could be worse! Oop, now it is worse, that didn't last long!
sounds like he rear end is out
The sprag clutch in the trans is bad. Actually a very small part
Hey Kev, have you ever seen a guy with an R/C Truck in the bedroom, when he has a Mook under the covers???...Keep up the good work guys, all the best from Scotland.
I've never seen magic performed with spark plugs 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gotta talk to Finnegan
Do that noise again, 😆
Stretch a fird truck, and swap the ramp bed to a fird(Ford). Just saying...
Definitely pulling a page out of Mike Finnegan's playbook on this one. Putting a Cummins in a ramp truck. Not a bad thing though! Albeit his was a squarebody Chevy.
My dad died on Saturday of last week and I look forward to your videos and this was what brought me to smile
Half drunk mook is funny 😂😂😂
More of Mook Crown and carbs ! Lol
Kevin it's good to see mook junkyard digs Miss her in junkyard digs okay this is Bob from Vero Beach Florida God bless stay safe stay warm and keep up the good work
You have blown head gasket.  Large amount of vapor coming out of tail pipe. You should have kept the Thermoquad on the engine. It ran better than the Holley.
Everyone in KY knows what they have. And most of it is all gone anyway
Well the 440 Runs
The rattle sounds like drive shaft or rear end.
Sucks for all the rust... Looks like it'd be a fun build... I'd love to find an old Crew Cab Dodge truck... Preferably with either standard bed or flat bed...  Would be cool to see this get built up though...
Also, the reason the spark gets better with a larger gap is it needs to build up a higher voltage to overcome the higher resistance
We hauled a 70 loadstar 1890. Found it tucked behind the tire shop in our home town and we bought it for 300 bucks. Broke through the boards on my buddies gooseneck and the front bumper sat down on a cross bar it the front of the trailer. I think my friend actually sent you a message if you wanted it😂
Let's see how bad the rust is. Is the frame gone? Let's see a a Cummins in a rusty Ole ramp truck just do it.
That's what you call a lighting rod.
Love the carb rebuild and the on screen gear selector!
'Factory Mouse Nest' killed me Mook. Thanks, now I'm dead, hecker.
18:17 I think that’s just so cool that you call up another YouTube for tips on demand!
That is a sweet machine.
Fun Fact: The factory starter from a 90's Dodge Dakota 3.9 V6 is a gear reduction starter that is cheap and abundant and will turn over a big block Dodge motor like it's Usain Bolt...I had a 12:1 compression 383 that the factory big block starter would barely move, and that little V6 starter would crank that motor over so damned fast...one of the best life hacks for Dodge big block owners...
I think more of your videos need a "drink and rebuild" section to them. God knows that's how my project functions.
Ya need to work on more Mopars to get some experience built up. Just a suggestion. 😁
Howdy from the Northwoods of Minnesota. Love to all n be happy and safe
For your Cummins swap try Brent up at half ass customs he's done some 12 valve swaps. He's like the king of LS and Cummins swaps or actually any swaps.
Lame as always. Great consistency
Rocco Chiero should be your honorary best man. Posthumous, of course.
Get a transmission from a school bus. 7spd or alison automatic.  Or find a single axle truck that had 5.9 n manual trans.
We needed more Mook
Is Hobbs named after Denzel's character in Fallen?
Don’t give up on her yet!
When it's that cold the first thing you should do is put a camp heater under the oil pan to get the oil warmed up so you aren't fighting molasses. Holy, that truck has a special place for Jesse right in the back. With a diesel I think you want to run the NV5600 which is meant to take the torque and another plus is it's a 6 speed, they came in 98-05 2500/3500 Rams with the 12 valve. Also you can buy a brand new NV4500 for $2200.  KITTY! Yes I want to pet the kitty.  Your issue with the spark.. not enough resistance? If it works when the gap is wide or there's an air gap between the plug and wire, does that mean someone pulled a resistor out of the distributor or the line to the coil? Okay after talking to my father, he's saying the coil is shot. (he was an Air Force electrician on the Titan II Missiles/SR71/U2) Every time you put that thing in forward it sounds like it's taking teeth off the pinion or ring gear. BTW you can get floor pans for that thing from AMD or Summit.. If you don't want to deal with replacing them, I'm sure one of your subscribers would be willing to come do it for you.. If I had a Real ID and could sleep on inner spring mattresses without being in excruciating pain I'd come do it for you.
Drunk Mook rebuilding carbs could be a show of its own!!!!
Angus beef ?
Yes, cummins swap! You don’t see many crewcab dodges of that era nowadays, I think it would be worth it even if it’s just a motor swap and nothing else, keep the old dodge rollin!
That's a damn good beholder though you'll have to take it out put it on a stand work it build it a 440 that's nice
There is a mid 70's firebird sitting in a field here in Rockford, Ia
I'm so glad he said "we do have engineering degrees". Also could have just cleaned the carbon off the exsiting plugs.
Willie shock 😲 😳 😐 😑 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆
Find a ford ramp truck and 12v swap it.
I could see spark jumping around behind the motor and passenger side firewall area but its hard to tell on TV so maybe not. Try it at night or somewhere dark and you can see if it's arching better
You saying return of the dukes of hazzard
Sweet!
@junkyardigs Mooks carbatator corner
The cab is rotten out in the roof from mice going up there and their piss has just eaten all the metal. Unless you have a good body guy with a lot of time it takes all value away. And I should know because I bought a crew cab just like this that was just as rotten. I have cut the trucks cab up already because it was impossible to save. I did everything I could to find parts, try and patch things, but it was never going to happen. I hope someone can, but it is beyond a tall order to fix one of these things once they get that bad. The bed is worth something but the rest of the truck is not. $3500 or less is the value of that truck without the bed. You will have better luck parting it out over anything else. Save what you can as it is rare, but I doubt anyone can/will build this thing. Don't want to be a downer because I love these trucks a lot, but I have gone down this very same road. The time and money is not worth it.
Don't give up on her.. funny video, ty
My truck does the same thing on those roads, thats why I never drive into iowa
why are u not doing all your videos while drinking "water"? hahaha
I just bought some raycon earbuds.
You gotta ask that guy if the dentsides are for sale😂where I live we don’t have shit so ur one lucky mfer in my eyes
Kevin two years old: “It’s literally never the spark plugs.”  Kevin now: “well shit, we need new spark plugs.”  😂😅🤣
Wife and I are sitting here watching this , holding my almost three week old daughter, Stella.  Literally the moment Kevin starts filling the shop with farts , baby girl starts loading her diaper 😂 my wife was getting confused on who was she hearing , was that Kevin or Stella ?  It’s both babe 😂
There was a Rocco Chiero that was a HUGE custom car builder out of chicago has NUMEROUS magazine features i bet with a name like that its gotta be the same man He died in 2019
I cannot believe that they have a warm shop and they are standing outside
Looks like a project for Dylan.
YEPPER!  BACK ROAD FINDS
Mook + Crown Apple = holy Christmas on a cracker😅
Dang another raggedy ass orange dodge what is this world coming to
Ford motor in a C6 transmission in it
Hey Kevin when you were under the truck did you check to see if it had a driveshaft on it
Fix the trailer by switching to Torsion Axels.
Sell it to Dylan Mc cool he'll love this thing.
It's a dodge
Mook you are technically awesome. Your charm and talent transcend alcohol. I hope Kevin realizes that without you adding so much to the channel he would have 39 views instead of 39,000. Thank you for being a wonderful part of this already amazing Channel.
TO COLD THERE
I just watched PBG's D100 revival and the overlap was surprising!
So what I learned is that dodge was stupid in the 70s for the larger trucks and does not want to live
Another great video guys keep up the great work always enjoy watching your videos!
Hey Kevin why don’t you fix the wire issue behind the dash and then take the carburetor off the motor tear it apart and clean it up and put it back on the motor and then try to see if it transmission will work instead of doing it your way because the way you are doing it makes for a longer video
hey so when you put  the truck in low and it made that noise it might be the rear end my nanny's truck did that and it was the rear end
I love your plan! That would be awesome!
Ok, why, did I just watch a lady rebuild a "carbatater" Because it's Mook, and shes fnin awesome! I
Strange world lot of smalls lol 😂
I hope you name the truck Uncle Rico
That thing is awesome!  So semi common dodge 727 problem, the plunger/servo that puts tension on the bands will crack and not hold fluid pressure. When my 73 d200's reverse servo broke it made the EXACT same noises. Drop the trans pan, pull the valve body and swap the servo's! Can all be done on the ground without removing the trans.   Bypass the amp gauge, and clean the connection wire that comes back out of the bulkhead connector to solve the "fire hazzard"
Mooks second channel - DrunkCarb Mook
Damn Mook you're doing alcohol abuse you're spilling it that's very very bad young lady
I'd sell it to Dylan and find a Ford ramp truck.
Sounds like the sun shell is busted in the trans
I run ac delco t44 in my truck, best plug
Welcome to "Drunk Mook Channel"... Nice
Perfect timing on the Mook carb rebuild segment.
19:26 The Carter thermobog the only carburetor that punishes you for trying to go fast 😂😂😂
Its a dodge of course, or should i say anything pre 92 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣
Hey Kevin thanks for this video I needed a laugh, could you please ply Mook with more water and point a camera at her more often, you two are hilarious 🤣😂🤣😂
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Can we get a video of your tow rig/trailer setup? Trailer looks really nice
Iowa gravel roads are better than most blacktop roads !
mook rebuiilding a carb while 16 sheets to the wind is just fire. hahaha
I think mook needs to lay off the uh... "Water"... haha!
birthday got better when i saw the youtube notification:))
get ahold of Dylan McCool
I ♥ this channel
Glad to see Mook is feeling better.
You can get a adapter plate  from diesel performance specialty. To run the nv4500 to Cummins
43:00 MOOK whiskey carb rebuild
Love me some 70's Mopar stuff. That truck is awesome. I wish I had never sold my 78 crew cab.
Thank God it's not just Angus. Watching him do a revival is like watching paint dry. No offense against him he's probably a great guy but some people aren't meant for Hollywood so to speak.
This Old Dodge A Beast..It’s Alive😅👻
So you've got a stationwagon with no reverse, and a ramp truck with no forward. Tada, problem solved!
Just think the Dodge brothers used to work for Ford before they went in to work for their self
RIP Kevins Weiner.
We need more “mook” carb rebuilds 😂 (don’t know if i spelt it right)
Heck!
Drunkyard Mook rebuilds a carburator was worth the price of admission on it's own.
keep the engine lose the rest !
its funny that most of thr viewers are to young to know what the space ship discovery ment lol. rip
Kevin! Take an 8 foot 4x4, cut it in half... Place the very end of each 4 foot 4x4 under the tail end of your trailer, then tilt the trailer down onto the 4x4's. Make sure they line up with the tires on the rear of the vehicle you are loading. This will raise the rear of the vehicle when winching before it drags its ass. Cutting a 45 degree angle at the end of each 4x4 helps like a ramp too... Take from an experienced auto transporter. Hope this will help you next time!
Had to bail when the drunk carb rebuilding started. Just not my idea of a good time.
I think I got to be the 3000th like. Shock to the baby maker. Ha.
Kevin: Tell them about the screaming deal! Mook, looks square into the camera: You can scream. I love impaired Mook carbatater shenanigans!
It's that early high tech Dodge electrical screwing with you
Well, you can't win them all. At least you got a pretty good 440 to start with😆
Rubber underwater sponsor for will it starts, protect your junk....
Mook should drink more often! She fuuuuuuuunnneeee
Please don't be like others and give up on it. Time and parts will find you!. Up here in Minnesota crews are gold!.  Yea you betcha. Thank you To you both!.🥶
Two if you stack them right …😂
If you're going to keep it, convert the drivetrain to ford or chevy. There's no rules in the car world. Its yours. Do what is best for you.
O and mook  spary his bottom with DDT that will stop him
Those are cutting edge bluetooth plugs
so many memories of my old 74 dodge. The janky ignition and questionable thermoquad included
REDNECK ENGINEERING WORKS EVERYTIME
Sparkplugs have resistors in them so things like your radio and all the other electronic crap doesn't receive interference form the plugs sparking. When the resistor fails it can either fail open or shorted meaning no voltage or way to much.
Keep and build her she's beautiful.
She’s an angry drunk 😂😂😂
Damn ol Dodge scrap yard 😂😂😂
Are you going to post the video of the Mustang from Garner, IA?  Even a “short” would be awesome!
a'ight, what you do is go to the nearest Wrench-a-Part, and pick up a driveline out of a rollover. Cummins or not, you choose. Problem solved.
Thank you for a great video in that freezing cold.
Having the coil located next to the carb is perfect if the floats blocked and it started spurting gas out.  Reminds me of the Lotus cars of the 70's having the coil directly behind the carbs to catch potential fuel leaks.  I watched a Lotus Éclat burn down for that very reason.
@56:12 you don't have dodge parts so why don't you pull the dodge cab off and put a good 4 doof ford or Chevy cab back on it?
You can fix the floor, you can put a 12v in it, but would the time and money be worth it? i say find a newer roll back and stick a 50's ford cab on it.
This week's video sponsored by Mook's drunken Carb rebuilding service  " Where did that part come from "
Hahaha. Canyonero.... Hahaha.
Mate what a great big pile loved it
Have U tried ralking to Dyan Mccool and see what he had to help?
Just thinking if you like the ramp truck and if the ramp bed is in good shape, maybe put the bed on a real truck (FORD)?
Love you guys
jalopy journal has a article about him. he passed 2019. go get the cougar
I don't mind getting more cat footage in your videos :)
1978 grill
THE BEST CARB REBUILD VIDEO EVER!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
It’s been in the high 40s low 50s here, really warm winter so far, I’m a big fan of dodge, my dream car is you guessed it 1969 Dodge Charger, or of course any dodge car that looks like a charger 😂 like a cornet 500 or roadrunner, that’s a awesome truck there, great find
one of the main things I get from this video ..... Kevin REALLY needs Pepto  lol
Drunk look is funny
More drunk Mook rebuilds. Pure gold
Yyyyeeeaaaahhhhh
This guy has the opportunity to get amazing old school cars for cheap and I don’t mbn
I say put a chevy or ford motor in it and use it as a tow truck like it use to be would be the best looking tow truck on the road will besides being a dodge the rest would be sick tho
Tell me what all you need for it
Algorithm bump !!!!
I have access to a 76 tradesman motorhome shell . It has a 360 V8 with a 727 auto with lower mileage also have a 727 in my 72 dodge D100 adventurer SE that was equipped with the lock up converter for fuel mileage I would be willing to part with if need be
I loved seeing the cats in the video so much
This is a very funny episode.
Thanks for entertaining me for hours. Please do some research on Rocco Chiero he was a somewhat of a known hot rod guy in the midwest back in the 79-80s
I like those Bluetooth spark plugs 😄
Sees thumbnail: holy shit it's not Finnegan!
Bluetooth spark plugs
Crush it!
When talking about the electronic ignition the box you pointed at is the voltage regulator. The ignition module is over on the driver's side fender.
Kevin shocking himself on the ignition unlocks the otherwise unreachable 11/10 score. It also triggers a 10 minute intermission for the wheezing and crying to stop before replaying that bit a couple more times. It also shows that Kevin is a true Iowegian.  The arcing down the side of insulator of the old plugs is because the carbon and oil and whatever else on the insulator being a better path to ground then the electrode. Clean them off, and they will behave.
the spark plug was arching to like that because carbon is actually conductive, thats why when the plugs are carbon fouled they dont spark because they are technically shorted out
Sorry that doesn’t work here in civilization where there is more than two roads per square mile lol
Absolute banger of a video loved every minute of it I just have one question for mook! Hey Mook where's your ring? Kevin get that girl a ring!!
I think Mook is on to something. A Commentary/podcast "Three whiskeys and one Mook" You guys could just talk about more technical stuff and recollect on some of the bloopers, stupid things and behind the scenes works of the channel
Maybe invest in a gooseneck trailer next time.
All I know is we need more drunk Mook rebuilding carbs. I'm still dying lol
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿
My opinion, in the future, Kevin try to trade this truck to Dylan for his Tractor Go-Kart 😛
Sorry but I don't think that is a 72 I had a 73 step side it did not have turn signal lights like that I believe it's closer to 76 I believe.  It runs better on a holly carb 750
All this monkey see monkey do content is getting old bubba... try to be original,..... maybe
Oh heck Dylan will probably buy it. You just did him a favor getting it to run.
you would think this was the first time you done this
Glad to see y'all got some studio lights. Looks like Mook was "Well lit". 😆
U can tell it's a 4barrell by the way that it is! 😆
It makes Roadkills ramp truck look like a mini cooper. I love your decision making Kev.
"Stuck my finger in there and found it"...ummmm that's what she said...
Well there’s that 😅😅😅
She's a nice rig. Definitely a fun addition to the fleet.    But that carb rebuild was outstanding.  Lol.    Those thermoquad carbs are better than people give em credit for. And they can be converted for e85 use.
I haven't seen your puppy in a while. Is he/she OK ?
I absolutely would love to have this truck since it’s got a big block with the original gear reduction starter in it. To bad it doesn’t have a 4-speed manual transmission in it. Looks like it’s in need of a new transmission. It most likely has a 727 Torque Flite.
do all the vehicle revival presenters just pass the same ramp truck around to "revive"
If you’re looking for a transmission for the truck, you’d probably have better luck finding a heavy-duty transmission off a larger application.   A recommendation I’d make regarding a transmission for the 12-Valve Cummins is an Allison 2500PTS or AT545. You’d be able to find those from box trucks or school buses and those transmissions are quite stout for usage. School bus transmissions (due to constant stop-n-go use) have hardened components to hold up to abuse.   The 12-Valve being used in various vehicular applications means there’s a whole bunch of adapter plates to mate it to various transmissions (mainly larger trucks and the heavy duty Dodge Ram pickup trucks) so finding an adapter plate for a transmission would be relatively easy, especially an Allison transmission.
Freaking love this rig!
LoL.... Here we have a junkyard with 100 cars & trucks! There you have 100 Junkyards with 1,2,3.... cars & trucks! 😃😄
Thermoquad!!!
As an Iowa boy always cruising marketplace, It is always fun to see things I looked at end up in your shop instead of mine. Thank you!
Hurray, Angus episode
I love this truck! Man that’s a damn good find. Definitely the perfect candidate for a Cummins swap.
Don't ever put a champion spark plug in a car they a junk 100 percent of the time .
Might want to check the driveshaft. Sounds like it is flopping around under the truck. Worth a look anyway.
Id say cummins and 20ft of driveshaft isnt a good combo. Lol
so how's your man hood 🤣🤣
I'll buy your thermoquad please don't trash
I just wanted to seize the opportunity to say "snatch block."
Hey junkyard I live over in pella iowa
Its never a junkyard digs video until Kevin either has to do brakes something is torqued to yes or he has to do a bunch of finagling around to get something started
To start a mopar: 1. build a big trebuchet 2. remove giant archaic  starter 3. utilize trebuchet to throw starter far away 4. parts store 5. buy a starter for any mangnum motor from like '93 up 6. enjoy whole new realm to engine start procedure

lol what a turd... its a dodge, i would have sprung for the old tractor the guy had instead... likely would have been running and driving in a couple hours. clearly a reason it was left to rot back into the earth. would likely make better fertilizer anyways. HA. at least you know about dodge and their trash wiring, but the rest of the vehicle is trash too.
Thermoquad: the fountain of sadness 🤣🤣🤣
Drive it in reverse! Lol back it up to where you want it to sit
Does anyone else want to watch a reaction of mook watching herself rebuild half the carb?🤣🤣
Regardless of the project or the end result, it's fun watching you guys work.  Quite a few good laughs in this one!
Just Gotta Luv a 440 R/T 😏😉🤣
I farted while watching this video Kevin. 😆
I knew there was a reason I always drink water & wrench on piles of hot garbage. Nice vid as always!
Can't wait to see more of this series
Best part of video is drunk mook
Bad transmission. I would get  rid of it. Another awesome video
Hey man love your content and wanted to start with that but something I've wondered for a while is that I know you have your own shop but I was curious if you did any mechanic work like professionally? I know your based out of Iowa somewhere and had lots of experience on old vehicles and I'm from Tennessee and actually just started my own journey because you inspired me to. Im working on a 91 GMC Sierra 3500 with a 454 and it runs but I can't figure out my blinkers, the dash show they light up when I push my brakes but not the lever, any ideas man? (May be a "C3500" but yeah that's my issue, other than the battery welding to my frame from falling off the tray and needing new wiring 😅) Update: I actually fixed everything and fixed the blinkers and it ran just fine I got home and went to shut it off and it died, the belt jumped on me, fixed it and it was running just fine and then boom now I've got a heavy knocking somewhere I can hear in the engine and feel in the shifter
RIP Rocco
Mopar mo'problems
I had a problem with a New Yorker and it turned out to be the Neutral, safety switch
Let off the transbrake button. 😆
1:53 YES. DO IT
So Mook rebuilding the carb, now that was just hilarious!!! My god I was dying🤣 Great video as always!!
Junk Yard Digs, come for the ramp truck and Mook's carb rebuilding and stay for the attention hog kitties.  The JYD mini tigers need their own channel.
Cant wait for the 12 valve swap! I want to cummins swap my 02 durango when the 4.7 goes out. Its a nice reliable engine, most reliable vehicle besides the daily jeep. I personally hate fords because they have always let me down, literally ALWAYS! The most reliable brand i have ever drove is honest to God dodge trucks. 4x4 cant be beat, its not even close and the 318 and 360 are slept on bulletproof engines that dont get the credit they deserve. The 4.7 is also a very good motor but they arent exactly anything special power wise but can reliably handle 500hp so they arent slouches either. Dodge makes good engines and most dont realize that if your trans starts slipping usually just replace your trans fluid and put lucas trans cleaner in it because its a shift solenoid thats getting clogged and that will fix the so called "worst trans" meanwhile ford and chevy transmissions are more recently showing they are trash and are going out left and right. The thing is its new ford transmissions that are going out and it was dodge transmissions that had wear and tear on them that went out. Fords trans' go out at random totally, dodges slipped for a little bit and was not a super hard fix meanwhile fords need a whole new trans or the trans needs ripped out and gone through for major damage...ask me how i know.
Trailer Solution: Air down tires when empty, air up before loading?
Of all things, "It still has its cats" just _sent me_
Nice try guys! But it is a Dodge
Kevin, did that belong to Rocco and Cheater’s speed shop??
I like the old truck beside it
Literally watched the last tequila powered carbutator rebuild last night. This is hilarious 😂
Hopefully u got a good cab
When she was rebuilding that carburetor in that Red collar cup had achol in it she had a buzz going
Very entertaining! Almost as good as the hot sauce tasting!
“ don't yell at me for using brake cleaner” it's your truck you paid for it you use whatever you want, I'm just here for the entertainment 😎😎
When I was watching Mook rebuild the carb, in my head I was thinking, "Make Daisy Duke proud, young lady." 😂 That was one of Daisy's challenges for the Miss Hazzard County beauty pageant in an episode of Dukes of Hazzard.
Drunk Mook is my favorite. :)
The carb rebuild had me in tears 🤣
yeah  but ya it goin
you need to pull the pan and see if the filter is clogged up that's first thing I do with transmission
will confirm Missouri weather is weird
45:08 Scaries out there!  😂
I actually jumped and gasped when the cup tipped over!!🤣🤣🤣  Someone in eastern PA would probably love that truck. It's nothing but Dodges and Chevy's here.
That's a solid post!
Sounds kinda like a rearend look and see if the drive shafts spinning
I have a 98 dodge I've been unscrambling. The whole thing was basically zip ties and fire hazards after the last person owned it
Speaking of limo…
ramp truck!?!?!? looks valuable and awesome
Maybe you n Dylan McCool could do some horse trading or a collaboration on the ramp truck
On the topic of spilled drinks lol. If you think about the price of bottled water it’s almost as bad as gas😂😂
Chrysler 727 reverse and first are on one band 2nd and 3rd is on the other band so if it moves reverse and it moves forward in first that's a good sign now that's all you got to do is get it to move faster to see a second and third work what from all my 7/27 I used to have in my Dodge charger RT's first in reverse would be the problem most of the time
Transmission = grenaded
Carb time was amazing 😂
Where have you been
As soon as he took the air cleaner off, I could just hear Freiburger saying "THERMOQUAAD"
It's the rear end buddy not the trans 😂
All the critters run straight to Mook 🙂
Yea!  Dodges !
Man it's true what you say about just getting off the main roads, I always see cars I shouldn't buy. Also I died laughing when you got shocked in the wiener haha.
Mook drinking 2 "waters" and rebuilding a carb is the funniest thing I've seen in a while
Never seen Ashley so drunk!
sell it to dylin
Mook what did Kevin do to you that you shocked his wiener LOL
when will farts not be funny
Dylan Mcool
the box behind the carb is electronic voltage regulator . Over on the driver side fender by the hoodhindge is the electronic ignition box .
U should 12 valve swapp it because that will be so unique.
I love Cummins swaps.  I hope you do your plan
Hopefully u do more content on this truck
I don't know when I've laughed so hard watching someone rebuild a carburetor. 😂😂😂 Maybe you and Chad from This n That Garage should compare notes. He has a Dodge truck that's the bane of his existence.
So put a ford motor and tranny in it. It'll piss EVERYBODY off!!
440 wasn't stock until 74,  love hearing the roar
I bought a pair of Raycon earplugs and the base sound is weak. I bought a different pair at Amazon for $16 and they sound great compared to Raycon and they even have noise reduction.
Would love to see this with a 12V cummins, Despite the rust Its a solid Truck If swapped right, Just needs stop sign floorboards 😁
did i see NH plates in that video clip i  the ramp truck video. when was that video
runs like a dodge.
Fun fact... when that resistor goes out you can start the vihicle, but it'll die when you let off the switch. Start it, keep it in the start position, put it in drive, still holding it in the start position, and drive it to an auto part store get another resistor.
Yall remember the NOS limo
And now you know why I havent used champion plugs for 40 years. They are straight garbage.
Is it just me that thinks old ramp trucks are just the coolest thing ever? And so very inconvenient to park ofc
4:07 heck 😂
It really should be saved not necessarily restored but saved
The Carter thermoquad is a really good carburettor and easy to work on when needed like in your case when the car has been standing still for many years.
I'm already doing things while half ass watching you toob. Not really paying any amount of attention I looked at the screen to select the next video when I saw this one. I said, "Oh cool, Finnegan bought another ramp truck." LMAO, nope, Kevin got this one. Better luck next time Mike.
Hey video production guy here, quick advice always turn up your lights and just turned down the explosion on the camera.
Is Mook the granddaughter of Foster Brooks?
Dodge Ramp truck is just too tired to participate 😴
Nice truck even the one by the tree caught my eye when you loaded the trailer
6:30, they make trailer hitches with air bags on them to help with that. Can’t remember what they are called but they exist
Mook is me if I was a woman
Just started the video and i love the truck already 😍 i sure do love a 1st gen dodge!
If memory serves,  A727's have 2 adjustable transmission bands.  1 (low) and reverse share the same band while 2nd and 3rd share the second.  Could be simply out of adjustment or the band itself has broke...among clutches and valve body issues.
I like your channel BIG time. But I have to say Mooks carburetor rebuild had was killing me. I was laughing my ass off.  Thank you Mook!!
kitty!!😺
we call it junk busting
You need a shocker hitch my friend.
I've been messing with mopars for years that's a typical Mopar starter sound only thing I ever felt one with a Chrysler product was the starter but they do make better starters for for Chryslers now the aftermarket ones ain't like the factory ones yeah they're market are far better
Dodge transmissions are garbage... That's the problem
Sounded like it was in between gears when you tried to move it, maybe slam it into low and hold shifter down n see if go forward
Cummins swap cummins swap cummins swap cummins swap
Glad to see you working on a Mopar even though there are not a lot here in Iowa. I have 2 Chevys but frankly they are a dime a dozen. Keep the Fords, Mopars and Internationals going
Dude your girlfriend is a funny mechanic..thanks good content...
For sell. No horn. Ran when parked. $12000! 😂😂
you can scream.
Cool Dodge
Mook, You should try your Crown apple with rootbeer sometime if you haven't.
This would be great for revivals that don't go as planned. Load 'em up and get 'em home. Love how well you two work together and have fun doin' it! Keep up the good work. Also, love my Ratcon earbuds!
How did you get shocked the first time in the you know what? Which video
Junkyard digs what is the price on that truck when you get done with it
Kevin rockin the cushmam parts getter.  Never has everything just most things. Somewhat better battery than used on the PBG Chevy stepside revival. Still a success 😅. Mook  carb rebuild kit not sponsored by Crown Apple. Darn. Need a starter guy.  Keeping Kevin over the power barn. Yep the air brakes stopping yr true success.  Like the video. Cheers 🎉
Why on earth did y’all not include *RAMPTRUCK* in the title?! You’d already have half a billion views. Motortrend would have been calling! 😂   Can’t wait to see the diesel swap and then whatever car gets this big block. Hopefully she gets some new parts and cleaned up. Roadrunner? Charger? I vote B body for sure.
Cummins 12V swap!!!!
Very interesting + comedic video 😂
The output shaft on the transmission blinds are probably worn off and the yolk is just grinding
You got a bad body ground...Hugh MC. Chicago,metro.
Sell it to Dylan McCool!
Now that's a truck🙂👍
I'm not going to spoil it for myself and fast forward to the video to see what happens but I am predicting that the factory Chrysler electronic ignition box is no good that and the round plugs on the back of the gauges cluster the pens on a circuit board itself are coming off from the solder cracking. I had these issues myself and I found that it is all common with these old dodges so I went with the GM four-wire electronic ignition module swap And resoldered the pins on the guage cluster. Everything works great now!
Boring video Seems you are getting bored with making videos
Watching mook rebuild a carburetor I'm about to fall down laughing great video
My slick JYD hat showed up today. Thanks Kevin!
II see no AC  Have always used ACs
Wiener Shocking, Farts, and drunk mook. Everything you need for a funny episode.
The fact that you completed the video yesterday, edited it, and then posted it in about a day is amazing. Also that Holley is way better. So much so, I’m thinking of swapping out my Autolite 2100 on my 68 F250/360 for a Holley 7448. Yes it’s a 2barrel. Love the video and thank you Kevin, Angus, and Mook!
440s a good engine, and the fenders look good. Part it out!
3 Commandment Do not misuse the name of the Lord your God, because the Lord will not leave anyone unpunished who misuses his name.
being 2wd you can use the 47re or 48re depending on what ctd as well and not have to worry about making it work with a transfer case. that said idk if the ramp truck has a pto drive. idr if a nv4500 has the output but i know the re does not. you already have the right column at least.
mook redoing the carb was so funny, i loved this video
Ask Mortzke if he can help you with the long trailer and how to make it a smoother ride. You could've put some wood on the trailer in front of the front tires at the same time as the rear to keep the ramp truck off the fenders.
For sure need to make more videos
Mook's carb rebuild is the highlight of this. Nice job!
My first car was a 1968 Mercury Cougar XR7, have not seen one in a very long time.
This was a fun video I really enjoyed the commentary between all of you guys. Kevin getting shocked was hilarious I was laughing so hard I was crying. I always enjoy watching Mook rebuilding a Carburator.
Supposed dodge car can be a 1970 coronet
U have never seen pugs that wouldnt spark I  have and there is only one reason for it proclaim dead but hen I am 74
Pray to you hold your mouth God name you ask to not saying GD with you in the life would not be without our savior Jesus Amen again please not to Damn God Amen
Hey are you sure it's the trans? Maybe the rear end is stripped out and making all that noise? Just a thought? Hope you end up doing the 12v conversion!
Mook, please don't stand to the side when they are trying to pull a stuck vehicle with a cable. Alternately, Kevin, get a Freedom or Yankum synthetic winch line to replace that wire cable. Please? I'm betting that you could contact Freedom or Yankum for one since you're always pulling stuff out.  You could also hit up Harbor Freight since they really like passing around their Badlands 15k winches. Just thoughts.
Been there done that so many times
Y’all are my favorite YouTubers out there
Yay!!! Kevin found the hole! We knew you could do it 😂
Bluetooth spark plugs lol
We used to get 12 valves from blue bird school buses at auction
Where is your dog? It’s been a while since I’ve seen him.
True I got a 78 Cordova I go on the back road with and I have found a couple of vehicles with
Watching your pain and frustration was well worth the 10 minutes! Lol 😆 🤣
I remember way back in to “60”s they used to sell plug wire spacers to increase the gap between the plug wire end and the plug to increase the spark. I also recall having to hold the wire away from the cap to get the dead cylinder to come in!
Nothing new that sparkplugs don't spark. I have seen it a lot of times.
WD-40 Tip O Tha Day Next time snatch a piece of 1/4 inch vacum line bout 2 ft and use that as your funnel to the cylinders n pump it in 😉👍
27:36 nothing else required 😂😂
Salvage  the ramp and motor cut your loss.
Dylan needs this truck!
You would love how much smother a 5th wheel trailer pulls down the road. My hitch was 2 piece's. Easy to take out and only the rails are permanent. Not gooseneck, 5th wheel. Easy to hook up also, just remember to drop the tailgate
Curious, have you met the roadkill guys?
30:55 That's those new fangled Bluetooth plug wires.🥺
Kevin be like:  Hey Dillon....have I got a deal for you!
I like drunk mode she's even funnier than normal
Friday the 13th is actually a lucky day and date Friday was originally called Freya's day named after the Norse goddess Of luck and love called Freya and 13 was  her lucky number, the Catholic church demonised the date and day intentionally by choosing it to bust a load of Heretics and kill them for their sins.
Give it to Dylan
Those are not spark plugs. They're just plugs.
at six fifty nine you made the winch sad
It's got a DULCICHQUAD!
I had a repo truck and the lift was electric over hydraulic.. I had a problem with the batteries always going dead, to fix that problem. I ran a wire from the alternator to an isolator and then to the battery., That way when the trucks running your battery is always charging. You should do that for your trailer!!!
Mook is the only person who I know that doesn't change when drunk
You need to get it to Dylan. He would be in heaven with it.
what a coinkydink. i'm drinkin shots of jameson as i watch this. up to 7 as of this comment. ok, make that 8. i thought the mopar tax made the price go down. challengers, chargers, demons, basically anything with an rt next to it's name i can see it going up, but a ratty old truck...that tax is on you, not me.
AMC also had the ammeter of death
I'm so sorry, I laughed way too hard at the shock from the bumper part around 30 minutes in....
The real MVP is Mook for being a great camera man despite suffering from hypothermia lol
Rocco passed away in January 2019. By the looks of it, his son goes by RocDaddy. The only car left in the family is a chopped 84 Caddy Eldorado
Champion plugs suck everything I’ve worked on never actually runs right with them
You know for their honeymoon it will be them in a 12 car transporter going around USA picking up old cars to restore together
Drunk mook rebuilding a carbotator nice
I have been so looking forward to you doing a ramp truck being in New Zealand we don't really have these and I have been waiting for you to have a ramp truck on the channel
LOVE the RT name, very fitting!
I have been shocked the same way a few times. Its always a unpleasant surprise.
That looked like a 67/68 cougar
Why don't you put a fuller 10 speed in it
I’m pretty sure there is no ether in brake cleaner. Tetrachloroethylene and ethyl ether are two different things
You're my favourite youtuber. I discovered you in 2020 while the pandemic, and your videos helped me get through isolation! Now when I see you uploeaded a new one I wait until the night to watch it comfortably on my room eating or drinking something.
Hey I had the same carb on my 440 can I have yours? How much and ship to Canada?
I also see a k/c series gm in the back!
Put air bags in the tow vehicle, they help with the bouncing of the trailer.  I ran them in all my F-350, F450 trucks.
Having owned a 75 mopar product for 7 years and 150 k never heard of a tendency to burn from these vehicles.
that clanking and banging sounds more like the ring and pinion are shot in the rear end, in reverse Its got preload on the gears so it drives but in forward the pinion moves away from the ring gear making it clank n bang, I could be wrong but that is what It seems to be
A disappointing episode but ya she's a POS. Thank goodness the cometary kept us watching
As a Canadian I would like to ask, "How you liking the weather?"
Betcha there's a guy in Tennessee that would like a truck like this.
That truck can easily fetch $837K as it sits
Old Dodges are an acquired taste. Takes a special kind of crazy to love em and put up with their quirks. Lotta fun when you figure em out though
Looks like a bad coil. Try a new one. Or electronic spark controller. You even said those ones stuck
It's barely worth scrap price it doesn't move and smokes like a steamship it's a fire Hazzard you should get rid of it
good ol coffin box sleeper love it
Yeeeeessssssss
I'm honestly surprised you guys didn't break the truck you used to pull the truck forward.  Single axle f250 trucks are not meant to pull another 4 to 6 ton dually tow truck while it's already pulling the truck itself and a trailer on its bumper.  That truck should of broken.
Sexy girl. A1. Loved those years
I got pretty excited when you said Cummins swap!! That truck is the perfect candidate!!
Off topic ? here.  from vieos was trying figure out what phone your have. it looks like android by samsung but the corners look a bit rounded so I cant telll ?  Im just curious since im on  a galaxy note 20 ultra and may want to upgrade.
Love the idea of the Cummins swap I was truly thinking the same when I clicked on the video
The Alison transmission is the best option. There's a chance to find a project someone did not finish.
Sounds like the torque converter bolts are broke
when a plan works ,  you guys are awesome, ah mook's not even hung over it will work , maybe, forward gear no happy
How dare you sir! A dodge has never burned to the ground.
"Muscle Truck"
12 valve swap IMMEDIATELY
You’ve got to do the Cummins swap. Just use the dodge body and fill it full of ford parts. Once you convert it to Cummins parts won’t be an issue anyway.
Hey man you are inching awfully close to that magical one mil subs.. congrats ahead of time!
I will def scream ....wooo freeedom!!!!
He don´t find the hole and Mook smiles
The nv4500 behind a dodge v10 is the same bellhousing
I sit here and cringe as you shit talk Dodge without even the experience or knowledge to know what a fouled spark plug is. At least you revealed that this trucks biggest problem is the idiot trying to start it.
I've heard shocks on the trailer can help with the bounce
Great job with the carb rebuild.
Never use a winch line to pull like that. That would get the driver of either vehicle 6:14
Put a Ford engine in it and just rebuild the floors with basic metals rather than replacement panels
Hey it looks like the right Guy for the right rust bucket
Too Mook       Or Not Too Mook 🤔🥸
i like that truck. hi guys.
The finding cars is true. I found a 70’s doge and Chevy and a 60’s Chevy car and a couple other cars sitting in the weeds not two miles from home
Who knew they had bluetooth plugs on dodge in the 70s
Trying to start 30. Yo oil without changing not very bright  Use marvel mystery oil in cylinders lubes everything  from dormant engine
Yes
Totally true,  I recently found a 1971 Chevelle on a gravel road.
science = weiner shocking. for the win
Yes iowa roads can definitely suck in certain areas,  I moved from northeastern iowa to Southeastern iowa and yup roads aren't much different.
Rocco passed away January 2019
Great ramp truck you have. You guys should go down to Woodbury and by sioux city and see what they have in the back roads as it's a pretty sizable place and there would be some goodies I'm sure.
1995 dodge pickup starter is a easy replacement for the old gear reduction unit.
If it’s a 72 then the grill has been changed because it is more like 77 or 78
Awsome content😎🔥👌 Cute cats😍
THE ROADKILL GUYS WOULD PROBABLY LOVE THIS TRUCK!!!
You should use a fuel hose to put wd40 in your cylinders it would be easier than manoevering the whole can, you insert one end in the cylinder then you put the straw in the other end ?!
Hell yeah, my dream
Finally a quality vehicle on the channel
"colder than an analogy" I am so stealing that one 😄
E
In Nebraska at my farm we have old cars
I wish you would be more like donut and put a "progress bar" at the bottom when you are doing your sponsor, that way when everybody is undoubtedly skipping it, they know where to skip to.
Finally! Evidence that I'm not the only person to have gotten shocked in the dick while checking spark!
Would be cool to see you build a drag car and take it to the track.  Doesn't have to be a 2000HP turbo car or anything.  Just a Junkyard Digs Drag car build. ✌🏼  Edited= Oh and the whole truck to haul it with too.
I was wondering if you keep that plow truck
i wish i never got rid of my ramp truck, good find
MOPAR, Mostly Old Parts And Rust
Champion plugs suck for lawn mowers... facts....
Oi what’s wrong with missouri?
Kool cat
Nice to see some mopar content
Hope you have better luck with your hodge podge dodge than I've had with mine. Love all the cats too!!
Ok.  Fine.  I'll do it.  I have 4 different sets of buds, and NONE of them stay in my ears.  I said next time I saw your sponsored like, I'd pull the trigger.  So, fine.  I'm doing it.
IM CURIOUS TO KNOW IF MOOK HAS TRIED THE ONE CHIP CHALLENGE SINCE SHE LIKE THEM HOT SAUCES?
MOOK. Your brother has gotten into your meds. LOL
What happened to the puppy?
I'm dying of laughter watching drunk junkyard digs
If they were cheaper I would buy me a pair
How is the old plow truck doing
6:26 Is there a place to submit JunkYard Digs GIFs cause I'm making that one now "Hruhbububub" - Kevin 2023
This is exactly what the team needs for revivals.  Looks like a great video.
Drop that motor in the amc eagle
"You said moron" and as you said it you were already trying to negotiate a way past it. I love seeing the real relationship you 2 share in these videos. If you look for it it shines through.
I'm a simple man, I see a old ram and I click!!   Mans said Cummins swap? I'm so excited!!
Junkyard Digs I have a allison mt 643 for a cummins if ur interested
Would be a great Cummins Conversion!!!
Name your price…I want it
Yeah probably.
CATS!!!😸😸😸💯
Just sell it to Dylan he loves rusty mopar junk. Make a colab vid where he brings up the exact pile of trans you need, getting the pile moving and he can drive it home on his channel and sleep in it. MAKE HIM TRADE YOU FOR SOMETHING HE HAS YOU WANT and use the ramp truck to bring it to you.
I had to laugh when you shocked your dong! My son in law was a welder and one day he was welding on a metal bench and his fly touched the bench! He got lit up pretty good!
There's a feller in Tennessee that wants that truck. You just know he does
Holding the spark plug wire further away from the plug caused it to have better spark because when you create high resistance (aka making the electricity have to jump an inch) it actually gains energy- aka then has great spark. This is an old hot rodder trick, whenever the engine would flood from fuel, they would pull all the plug wires off and just hang them on the plugs (make it have to jump a large gap before getting to the plug like you did) to allow it to generate greater spark energy and start even with fouled plugs
Looks like it was used as a touring ramp truck for a NHRA team back in 77
Kevin touches the gas pedal and it gives up and Mook says "Ope it's gone".  So Midwestern.
That Dodge reduction gear starter is not long for this world. Even at the best of times they weren't that durable.
God the crunching noises as you fold the trailer down sounded terrible
waiting a week payed off WAY to well
Saturday Digs. Nice!
10:01  I just bought a 67 cougar last night lol
🍀🤘🤘
Call Dylan McCool he’s going to have a good 727 trans and he speaks Mopar 😅😅😅 it would be a perfect fit for him
Champion plugs are like Fram oil filters. Junk. Imo.
you missed comedy gold with the intro should have called it a big block
it is mr mook, miss mook, and angus.
It looks like a giant wedge shaped Reese's.
Love the content keep it up brother
Good ol dodge electrical.
16:10 Rocco Chiero is a huge classic Customizer.. Ronald J Chiero aka Rocco.. according to Google he is living in Crestwood Illinois
Thermo quads and quadrajets are good carbs. Just got to know how to work on them
I can’t believe you find all this stuff kevin
Was this a manual truck, only i noticed 3 pedals. if not a manual gearbox whats the 3rd pedal for
Love to see you swap out an Automatic for a 6 Speed Manual transmission
Crew cab and a coffin? Ramp truck.
cant wait to see some BBD
Just like zip ties and bies plys said 😂 second hand dodge wiring problems, but awesome tow rig you got. Love the content 😊
Posted 10 minutes and already over 150 comments. I remember when I was in the top 100 in a 10 minute window. Glad your channel is growing. Its always great content
Dude she busted ass and blamed it on you fukin awesome she even leaned
Love to see this Cummins swapped
Haven’t clicked on a video so fast, never even seen a Mopar ramp truck.
30:08 - How you like those vanilla nut zaps.
Rocco chiero built custom vehicles for decades.
Yes!! That’s awesome! Ramp truck action!
Speaking of the limo that video has a lot of views so when is the LS twin turbo build happening? hmm??
That is a real diagnostic system, I used to work at a chrystler stealership that had this huge machine that would plug into that and you run a huge amount of vacuum lines that you would also plug in everything and it would tell you if it was running lean or whatever.  yeah i dont even know if the damn thing worked or not but thats the story I was told.
Coolest ram truck ever
I'm only a few seconds in. However.. my best guess is going to be complaining about the wiring. 99.995% guaranteed. Also I dare bet if you spent 1/10 th the time learning it, you would like it. Way simpler than people make it out to be. And proven more efficient. It's really not hard. Js. (I'll edit if needed after I watch)edit 1.. 20:20. You are wrong just run a separate ground to the base of the module. The way it's wired does not like weak connections. Some trucks came factory with it. As well as some cars. If you don't it will run like dirt and you'll burn it up.
Pausing at 16:00 in to say I am suspecting this truck might have been cobbled together a bit using parts from other vehicles.
Don't take this the wrong way, I had to pause this as soon as I seen the cougar! That is my dream car and just a suggestion, that would be an awesome video if you were able to get that! Lol love those 67-68 cougars!
Could you revive a shell in the middle of the woods lol. 😂
Let's strap the Hjell out of this and go home
Maybe this would be too much to ask but if it's ever possible. please have a video on January 29th that would be an awesome birthday gift. just to watch your content it's always entertaining.
Thermo quads are completely useless junk

Mook please get on your nova would love to see it on the road
Do you have a 30/30 power prob that’s awesome

Ramp trucks are sooo cool bat also weird
I've never even seen a crew cab of this body truck in person
dont get rid of this truck, its defiantly worth the money since its a crew cab
I'm a mopar fanatic with a 76 w200 400 4 speed powerwagon and love thermoquads.  Have over 20 of them in the shed. Great carbs in the right hands
I AM THE 1K LIKE mwahahahahahahaha
Kevin, I'm litteraly working on the same truck, Right now. 1979 dodge custom 300
Split ring rims. Not split rims. Still dangerous to mount tires.  No where near as sketchy as split rims.
Dang I'm surprised Mr. Mopar himself aka Dylan Mccool didn't beat you to that truck lol 😂👍
Love the cat joke Mook.
Nice Orange Tabby Cat
Check the floor vents for nests too.
OMG what cool truck
Couple friends always recommended Upullit in Omaha for parts for my chevy cavalier race car. Maybe if you guys have time, road trip to Omaha they have 2 or 3 locations in Omaha they may have the transmission your looking for
Can we give props to that trailer winch ?? The real hero of the video.
Those bulkhead connectors were notorious for having high resistance over time. They would overheat, melt and catch on fire. There would be one heavy gauge wire from the engine compartment through the bulkhead connector, to the ammeter and then back through the bulkhead connector again. In the older models if the ammeter burnt up then the vehicle basically got no power to most circuits. Chrysler charging systems sucked back in the day also. Alernators on most standard duty vehicles were a pathetic 35 amps. The five wire box is the electronic ignition. The pickup coil on these gave the most trouble. The two wire box on the bulkhead (firewall) is the electronic voltage regulator for the alternator. Those usually did not give any trouble.
I was here at 94 comments
1977 or 1978
Rocco chiero was a custom car builder and hot rod guy.  Some of the cars he put together were simply amazing... Last known he was still alive in 2017 and living in chicago.
JANUARY 15TH here in NEW ZEALAND.
Why do i get the felling that mook would be good as the grinch😂😂
So hyped for this build
Oooh, I want to see how this project goes Also, big-block race car?
My son and I are hoping to meet you one of these days. Living in Iowa we're bound to run into each other. Keep up the good work 👍
Jus sayin
“Step one , let’s see if she spins” would be a good caption for a t-shirt!
Yes more JYD and more Angus!!!! This is exactly what I needed
A sign of change lmao
I know a guy not to far from you that would give his half interest in hell for that truck! He lives in Newton. I would like to have that old grain truck, but I'm 400 miles from Newton!
im suprised the tires were still inflated for 27 years unless you guy aired them up before the vid
Old Dodge truck. Birdbath hood. Orange paint. Middle of winter. What can go wrong?
Im so glad I found your channel by chance I am now subscribed to you and mook love both the channels big love from London UK
Got the feeling this one will be a fight.
Oh hell yes Kevin and crew... thought I'd throw it out there that acetone mixed with ATF in a fancy sprayer is the best penetrating lubricant by far and it's super cheap-unstuck a few engines and lots of rusty bolts with it, on the daily.  Also another tip: just the tip, and only for a minute: if you buy a compression whistle, they're a neat and useful toy that can be modified with a grease zerk: you fill a cylinder with both valves closed with ATF/acetone mix to the top-screw on compression whistle with a zerk tapped in.  Then pump in grease at 10,000+psi from a grease gun.  Either the engine gets unstuck or it blows the head gasket.  Used a version of that many times with great success, even a rusty Honda bike with no spark plugs outdoors for 10 years
Something to drag home your other junk
Try to find yourself a Dodge Coronet you can put a 440 in one of those That's what the blues Brothers blues Mobile had in it
Now that is one cool old rig. Im a huge fan of old ramp trucks now thanks to Finnegan

A YouTube channel and a ramp truck. They seem to go together like peanut butter and jelly.
Hey, what's happening with the limo? The video got the views you asked for it, and mentioned an engine swap.
The trailer noise😂😂😂
Hi i got here within the first 6 minutes of this vid being posted and its a good vid
And kip up the good work

Dodge ramp truck, very cool
You should make a video where everyone plays basketball in the front yard and comically slam dunk on a way too low hoop. Then do a celebratory traditional Irish dance.    You could call it "Dunkyard Jigs".
Thank you for this amazing content!
When are you going to post a new video on your onlyfans account?
Big block dodge? Say no more, here we go! MOPAR or no par, baby!
It’s a Dodge. Of course not.      Jk please sell it to me
When you mentioned 12 valve cummins swap, I got excited. Be sweet with also dual 4in stacks out the side in front of the bed
Thanks for the video stinky
