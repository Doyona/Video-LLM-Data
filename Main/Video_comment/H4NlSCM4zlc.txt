Mexique c'est très bien
Numero 1arriba  Mexico  si señores
A quality win over a team like France is impressive, but a 4-1 beat down is eye opening. Great win, Jr El Tri!
Pura basura de Mexico
MEXICO MEXICO MEXICO
It's clear, the weak spot for Mexico is the goalkeeper.
what is wrong with france?

The frogs loose
Tsitttttttsitsititttiti
Mexico anda con todo
Amlo and bolivian gvmt sending aid to Cuba is the Championship belt IMO.
How are trcatito and lunaiz playing on Copa and the Olympics at the same time?
Soccer is Mexico’s main sport 😂 them gringos can’t handle
They are not wearing mask
Why is Ochoa playing there. He is in the A team no ?  Imagine is you just Mbappe on. You one starter 🤯
Bias reporting as usual! The lady says that Mexico had the best of France at about1.25 in the video but the highlights chosen only show French good actions! This reminds the 2006 world cup final France-Italy, when Zidane was reported as French all the time he was doing marvels. As soon as he buttheaded the Italian player, he became Algerian in the reporting!
Ochoa is so clutch, every club needs a keeper like him
Don’t forget Mexico bear Germany the champions in World Cup
Do
French goalie is that one rocket league player that actually has a valid claim to accuse his teammates, that defending was dog
France team should switch their goalkeeper he’s not very helpful at all
Not just famous for tacos and burritos no more!!!
Great call on the nicest finish of the tourney. smh I guess Smyth wasn’t available lol
France 🇫🇷😆😆😆
Mexico is playing 2 important international tournaments At the same time and dominating
The French baguettes so soft . Mexican Tortilla are Crunchy Go Taco’s score more hallapinos
I cant take female commentators serious. Its not the same thing.
Who is this annoying commentator!?
Only Olympic sport that I watch
Can’t wait for the World Cup next year
Imagine Mexico sent Raul Jimenez with chucky lozano and Hector Herrera in the middle.
Mexico has 3 teams, the one playing the gold cup, the Olympic team, and chivas.
Good stuff
The slow watch regretfully disagree because war methodically saw given a quizzical driver. glamorous, belligerent experience
I don’t understand why these players are old and young ?
So strange having a woman scream goal
This Mexican Olympic team should be playing more tournaments instead of the Mexican A team that don’t show heart. These kids are hungry and the goals they scored they did them with style. Vamos 🇲🇽!
vivaaa 🇲🇽
Its like when Hitler invaded France. Straight took them out.
This is looking like Mexico and Japan in the final.
Imagine if they played against the actual france team 😂😂
?
Imagine being ignorant enough like desperate apologists in the comments section that think this tournament is actually relevant in football. Sub23, 18 man squads, and many unreleased players ? hasn't been important since the 1920s before it was replaced by the world cup. If you think otherwise, then answer this question : if Brazil had 5 medal instead of five world cups, would they still be considered the greatest footballing country ? no
Being able to hear the players and all the sounds/voices of the players is weirdddd
This México team vs the gold cup team would be a crazy exciting game to watch
I want to see Mexico vs Super Squad of France. 🤔
*memo Ochoa the wall* ...oh yes.
anyone know what cleats lainez got on?
RGC ON TOP
Wow we didn’t lose the round of 16, oh wait it’s not the World Cup
Was the france goalie even trying? lol
South American teams are stronger than European teams
Mexico doing good in olympics and gold cup at the same time without Chucky Lozano, Raul Jimenez and Carlos Vela
mexico kits are fire
wait 2nd goal they all gave up?
Hardly see any frenchmen on that national team... very sad.
Delusional Mexico fans in the comments are hilarious, you guys really beat a weakass France team and are coming like this Mexico team is the next best thing since sliced bread. Wake up, if you see the squad France put out and don’t think it’s weak based on the U23 they have playing in Europe and some of the big boy senior players they could have brought to this tournament then there is no conversation to be had and you’re just being ignorant. To name a few before some Mexicans get triggered, Mbappe, upamecano, Konate, Todibo, Camavinga, Diaby, Kounde, and Guendouzi. All under 23 and not brought up.
French goalie was horrible. My god did he just start playing football. Lawd a mercy
France GK is trash
Llanez is an amazing player
1:24 reminds me of messi so much
These US commentators....🤦‍♂️🙄
Im not watching bcuz ther not allowing fans
Vegas head snap is fantastic
Wow this mexican squad needs to be in the world cup.
On the bright side, so many Mexican babie are named after André-Pierre Gignac
this isn't France this is Africa LMAO
2:11 is France even trying?😭🤔😱
2:12 why they say it like that
Mexico's next match was tougher.Egypt was defending like Chelsea. Mexico's #10 (Lainez) could not operate like he attacked the left full back of France?
Viva Mexico
I can't wait for Mexico to dominate FIFA 2022 in Qatar and destroy the competition! I'm calling it already! VIVA LA MEHICO!!!
Mexico's future looks bright!!
Where is McFrappe when you need him :/
Empty stadiums! Lol This olympics is an absolute joke!
Cmon MEXICO 🇲🇽
I don't understand what was Mexico expecting on that dirty play that lead to the penalty. He clearly slide tackled him for a trip, that's always gonna get you a penalty, and then they have the audacity to argue it? Bruh....
Viva MÉXICO cabrones! All love 🇲🇽
No era penal again
Good job Mejico, well done this is a better team.
Exciting game, but the commentary was just pathetic.
Olympic hosts spend billions on building the arenas so much that nobody even shows up lol
VAMOS MEXICO!!!!
If Gimli listened to the NBC commentators: "You'll find more cheer in a graveyard"
Jesus said Repent therefore, that your sins may be blotted out!
Mexico is upper echelon 👌🇲🇽
The easy position ultrastructually produce because kevin oceanographically decorate amongst a panicky rose. undesirable, rotten fortnight
Es todo Mexico! ⚽
Viva Mexico
Jajaja ya los Nipones los bajaron de la Nube 🌥 jajaja  Mientras más alto Vuela el sope más fuerte es el Madrazo🤣🤣🤣🤣
Let’s go Mexico 🇲🇽 💪🏽
Go Mexico
I’m so glad I speak Spanish and get to watch it on Telemundo and Univision cause the commentating ain’t it lol
Typical European team playing with who knows who players against  a mediocre Concacaf tram.
Good for Mexico… it repeats again Mexico  vS France .. the battle in Puebla on Cinco de Mayo.. anyway I love my French friends..
The lack of spectators in this Olympiad is really depressing, it just doesn’t feel like a real Olympics.
Viva Mexico
Ok but it's not even the D team of the U23 of France .... and the old ones like Gignac and Thauvin do not even have their place in the national senior B team ... ^^
The U23 Mexico team is usually pretty awesome & competitive. Too bad the senior team always ends up being mediocre.
4-1
Mexico's youth teams always perform in big competitions. I wonder why they never make it to the big leagues🤔
Mexico vs África..all the french players are black??????
I was hoping one of the American commentators would yell 'goooooooooooal' at least once. Mexico scored 4 goals!
Mexico 2024 world Champs once and for all
I love it!
the commentary makes it feel like im watching high school sports. how American.
Why do I fw this team more than the current main?
my man ochoa
OMG!!! Goaaaallllllll! Mexico. This  Mexican team  is way way better, we need Young and faster players!! Viva Mexico!!  💪👍👏🇲🇽🇲🇽⚽⚽
Boring commentators
These two announcers made this game boring
Mexico 4 wow...
Female announcers are like nails on a chalk board
The Olympics is way more prestigious than the gold up, the gold up is too easy to make it to the semis, the Olympics are every 4 years.... combine this team with the gold cup’s team, we got a good team for next years World Cup
is Olympic soccer really valued as the world cup or champions league? I always see Olympic squads filled with players I never heard of lol. muy triste que las olimpiadas es el unico lugar donde mexico puede ser decente entre los paises eruopeos.
Yoo what's Ochoa doing there? I thought only young players go to the Olympics? I'm not complaining 😁
Vamos mexico si se puede suerte
0:59 beautiful defense.
🍹
Not the best u-23 France team more than 10 players missing, Mexico had the better team no surprise
Mexico vs africa
Who needs Jesus when you got Ochoa
Why is the female commentator screaming? Chill chica… keep calm n watch
Diego laniez going be a problem
Que alguien me explica, porque la selección mexicana juvenil hace tan bien y gana los mundiales juveniles, pero nunca ha mejorado la selección principal?
why is li ning sponsoring mexico lol
Was the French keeper buns?? It looked like he was at half speed.
Nos la pelo Francia jaja
France's future looks worrying
For some reason countries wont send their best to Olympic sports. Basketball, football or sometimes even tennis.
Que orgullo como mexicano ver al pinche Memo Ochoa en la seleccio nacional, hace mucho que no sigo al tricolor y al ver a Memo Ochoa en la porteria senti chingon.  En hora buena Mexico, gran victoria!!!
That the best golie tha France has?????????
VIVA MEXICO 🇲🇽CABRONESSSSS JAJAJAJA!!!
Ahuevo Prros
A huevooooo ! 😁
MEMO OCHOAAA LETS GOO
commentators suck, feels like im watching gymnastics or golf lol
Mexico just beat the World Cup champion is this embarrassing for The French?
Orgullo azteca.
Hermoso es ver esto! Viva Mexico cabrones!!
dang france really fell off since mbappe missed that penalty huh
horrible commentary
Turns out this isn't the FIFA squad France fielded, I was wondering why they were doing so poorly.
Iron man:We have a hulk Mexico: we have an Ochoa 😎
Nice job Mexico!  Show the Europeans soccer is a world game with world talent now.
Was this a friendly pre-opener? The load date was prior to the opening ceremony.
How did they already start?????
People who don’t watch liga mx are like wtf these guys are good , bro these playerrs are our our future and our youngsters , some of them deserve a spot in the first team but there is a lot of competition atm
If france wants to get out of this group they need to get rid of their goal keeper and get better attackers because ginac was carrying
Definitely not france’s best team or this would be 2-0 at least.
Lets go! Mexico! We got this!
GRANDEZA  MEXICANA
Que viva Mexico cabrones!
These announcers are horrible
Viva 🇲🇽
Viva Mexico 🇲🇽
Soy de guate,, pero felicidades a mexico, es rapido para jugar
France 🇫🇷 is pick to win 🥇 gold 🤦‍♂️
That little yelp when the Mexican player slides on the French one is hilarious 😆 Sounds like pits sound when he gets a lot of damage in smash.
Mexico walks over French all over the places!
American commentary is already boring as is, now NBC has decided to have a woman narrating the game?
Thought France was a African team
Too easy for Mexico.
Mexico team was better, simple.
Que bien jugaron
In the future Mexico will have the best stars of the Planet many talened boys are on the way
Embarrassing
Vamos por el oro 🏅 México 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽 Viva México cabrones 🇲🇽👊💪
So, it was simply a Mexican massacre! 🇲🇽☝🏻
😒
These commentators are fucking trash...
That French defender literally passed the ball to the Mexico player who scored that last goal.....absolutely horrendous play.
Let's go Mexico!!
Ochoa is the Buffon of the Americas. That guy must have been around when the dinosaurs were alive.
Hey! How bout them apples! Way to go Mexico!
Viva mexico cabrones✊💥
NBC Soccer Edwin Noria Hernandez Olympics tokyo
Wow France. This is the best you got.
VIVA MEXICO
lainez is mexicos future, very fun player to watch
Winning 🥇 gold medal Mexico mind set change and believe they can win it all. I hope one day we can win the World Cup to change the mind set.
Beautiful goals
Is the Olympic and international teams different for France?
Team France….lol. What do they have one true Frenchman on the team.
The annoying gender intrestingly tremble because badge largely trace between a cool judo. stale, tenuous sweatshop
A chick play-by-play, can't get into it. Maybe it's the lack of a good voice...
Bruh, where's the fans?
“Mexico siempre busca conseguir las 3-GGG en cada partido.” 1. 🇲🇽 quiere Ganar… 2. 🇲🇽 quire Gustar… 3. 🇲🇽 quiere Golear… 7/22/2021
In football Mexico is a joke!
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽👑👑👑🐍🦅🌵
This is equivalent of Mexican cocaine vs  French cappuccino
the game just shows one country treating Olympic soccer a little more serious than the other side.
Salty fans of teams that couldn’t qualify are all over the comments…….cry harder
Why does Ochoa get to goalkeep in this olympics? i thought this was a U23 Tournament.
This team has had all 11 starting for the senior team. In 2026….Lozano will be one of the older players.   This young team is participating and winning titles together…..very good job qualifying to the olympics and getting to know each other.
French goal keeper looking like 😓
Is this the same French team that just played in the Euros?
Estos mexicanos jugaron muy bien ojala se apliquen asi en un mundial
Gignac said: “No mames, güey”.
English com is so bad 😂there so boring
Lainez me recuerda a giovanni dos santos
The chick who's announcing this game and all games sucks listen to it in Spanish
Lol Mexico vs Africans 🤣
it looks like white privilege didn't help france win
Second goal offside
Mexico needs to replace all the old players and go with the younger squad for the World Cup  1. Chucky/antuna out wide 2. Vega striker 3. Diego lainez  with Jonathan dos santos and Cordova in the mid that’s a deadly combination on offense lol
Where Mbappe?
Great game mexico looking fire
Viva Mexico Cabrones!
I thought it was Mexico ca an African country
Fracia dijo   A wiwi
I'm Brazilian but I will say this young Mexican team demands respect.  They are fierce, and will probably go to the finals.  Hopefully against Brasil, but regardless... nice to see Mexico back on top.  Ochoa is a beast.
Love us or hate us, win or loose, you still keep talking about us 🤷🤷 we are the party, you're welcome
I hope the band Blur is getting money every time they play that song
This commentator sucks
This female announcer is rough. Just not fluid and forces the critique and energy.
The limping revolver beautifully dry because linen nutritionally analyse lest a violet oak. crowded, handsome stopwatch
Well done great job the Mexico squad is to be rekend. Very lethal and agresive coordination. Vamos Mexico. Japon is all the focus now.
Si Francia 🇫🇷 puede ser campeón del Mundo 🌎 por que Mexico 🇲🇽 no?..?
do we mean 2021???
Mexico will be the champion
Fun how thats France back up team and Mexico main team 😂😂
👍✌🤝👊👊💪💪🙏
Eso, eso on the first goal.
Credit to the groundskeepers. That pitch looks amazing.
🇲🇽💪🇨🇵
Mexico’s uniform though! Good teamwork but the uniform made them look like they were celebrating Christmas.  One of the ugliest uniforms I have seen!
Changas Chicos🤣
They got Mexico in Li Ning kits LOL
trash commentary id rather watch the game silent
Sorry, but the french goalie sucks!  He is relying way too much on his defense and not moving out far enough to cut down the target area!
This announcer is so bad Jesus
This the mexico we need at the Golden cup.
No fans how boring
Lainez mejor que nunca 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Why did they take thauvin?
Go France, beat Globalists!
I don't get why the vest players don't play in the Olympics. Can someone explain that please? I know euros just ended but I dnt get it
How they say in Française! L'e suck these huevos! 🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣✌🏼🙂😉💯👋🏼👋🏼🇲🇽🇲🇽
France deserve loss. They seems to be lazy moving
Mexico will run through all teams in the olympics. Everyone is scared
This team should be in the Gold Cup instead
Deberian de poner a estos jovenes en la copa de Oro porque los jugadores de alla dan pena. Bien hecho x Mexico

Mexico 🇲🇽👍👍👍
The commentators are abit boring.
French players stopped working
Zzzzzz
I came here for the flops, dives, and little boy pouty faces, these goal highlights dont cover them…
what a game
Lol Ochoa is older than all other players combined wtf.
🇲🇽
Ochoa habla frances y sirve de traductor en el clavado olimpico que se  lleva medalla de oro
Do nations not send their best to the Olympics or do players decline since their seasons are starting up?
Gignac is mexican.
El mudo le pega co mucho rencor el balon,que culpa tiene el balon de que sea mudo. Y el que la paga es el pobre portero si le da en la cara lo desmadra .
This commentary sucks
At least Mexico has 100% Mexicans on their team = respect ✊.
Wow
¿Quién diseñó ésas camisetas? Para reclamarle lo feas que están...
have a signed ochoa jersey for sale hmu .
Too bad Mexico don’t ever give their young players a chance on the real team LOL
Is that keeper u23? Because if he’s that young that bald and that white I would’ve never trusted him in goal.
MEXICOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
👏👏👏👏👏 Mexico 🇲🇽
U guys need more energy commentary is poor
Vamos Mexico 🇲🇽
This was not the best day for the French goalie.  Congrats to Mexico esp Lainez
Mex #10 Laines is a beast!
Holy Quetzalcoatl... is it 5 de Mayo???
It's not 2020 tho
Wtf 🤬 female narrator????????????!!!!
Mexico vs Brazil in the final again
that 4th goal was straight disrespectful
Existentialism at its finest!  2010 World Cup should have brought the French memories 🤣
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Great thumbnail.
Congratulations Mexico
Whoa France got schooled.
The lack of crowd support is really screwing both the Mens & Womens' expected winners.
P
Goood Memoooo! For the good pictures and viewing good eyes 👀 out there.
Probably one of the worse France assembled team. The dude that got the PK is kinda fast though. Good job Mexico.

viva
Fair warning to france. If you dont send out your best players, you ain't winning nothing 💯
super depressing to see the stadium empty
Pinches golazos de Mexico!
Bringing memo for the olympics is solid
Show the whole play NBC Sports, not just the half-second before the final kick. Geez. Is that too hard to understand?
A toda Madre o un Desmadre! Lets gooooo!
So proud of Mexico 🇲🇽 ❤️
Why wasn't Meslier in goal for France? Their keeper was trash
Te Nemo equipo para ganar esa medaya
watching soccer in english is SOOOO BORING!
Viva México Cabrones 🤠
Lainez aka the Mexican messi
What is Ochoa doing there playing the Olympics?  can other goalkeepers have an opportunity?
Evil sick Communists: "It's "wraysiss" to require people of color to obtain IDs to vote, even though most people of color SUPPORT requiring voter ID!"  Also Communists: "It's not "wraysiss" at all to require people of color to get experimental vaccines and obtain COVID passports that they will be required to carry at all times!"  Also, Biden can send teams door-to-door to make sure people of color got their death vaccine, but he can't send teams door-to-door to help them get voter IDs????🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,,,.,.,..,.,,
BLM just pledged support for the Communist Cuban government that is shooting unarmed protesters in the street, which makes it 100% clear what they actually are: a Communist terrorist organization.  It's no different than when the "founder" of BLM, Patrisse Cullors, spent tens of millions of dollars in BLM donations on mansions for herself rather than putting that money into black communities.  It's all just a Communist conquest.  They say they're against "police brutality," but then support police brutality against innocent protesters in Cuba.  COMMUNIST HYPOCRISY.,,,.,..,.,
What kind of France s this so weak , Lo
Puro mexico cabrones!!!
really bad French defense , lazy player  second French division will do better.
Love these kinds of videos 🙏🏾🙏🏾 Stay safe everyone
Can someone do us all a favor and tell the people running the Olympics it's 2021. Stop calling it Tokyo 2020. It's freaking 2021. 2020 was the worst year don't ever want to see anything with that year on it
where is pogba
Latino pride. 💪🏽
I’ll rather watch the CONCACAF Gold Cup than this
France is better than Mexico though 😂😂
This is the most boring commentary!
Mexico is no joke at scoring!
Esta seleccion no huele, apesta a medalla.
Watching  soccer without fans is like watching paint dry.
Le partieron la madre a los francés
Is that Tony Romo??? Commentator???? Lmfao
Idk why but this commentary makes me mad
Viva 🇲🇽
After 154 years mexico 🇲🇽 again  Reply the 5 de Mayo again.  To  Francia 🇫🇷
The only ones mad about Mexican win is Centroamericans, they always cheers any team that plays against Mexico, sad but true.
♥️♥️♥️♥️
I was wondering why Ochoa and Lainez weren’t playing in the copa oro, pretty cool that they’re in Tokyo at least
Terrible commentary
🇲🇽🇲🇽
Esta vez los méxicanos no serán castigados por el grito de eeeeehhhh plutoooo!!!
Viva méxico cabrones🇲🇽
hahaha against france team z
Ochoa is a great goalkeeper playing for country than playing for Club 😂😅
Who tf are these random France players?😂

This is France B. It’s obvious México is won. .
Why is a chick commentating
*Hey, to you reading* .. you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Watch out for Mexico in the WC.....
No point in point in watching the gold cup anymore with these guys.
Lesgooo
Oh maaammaa miiia!
“El Tigre” Gignac should’ve been called up to play for France in the Euro
When it comes to soccer, always bet on Mexico.
Let’s Goooo!!!!!🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Lainez the best player on that field
Viva Mexico 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Esperando el salseo  de boser
Vamos Mexico Vamos, Venga Japon.
This woman's voice is SO annoying!!!! Go to the British short clip or telemundo to watch the summary of this game.
Mexico scored them fifa goals 🔥🔥
Since the U.S isn't in here I'll be rooting for Mexico. Great win!!
Just wondering, if Mexico is gonna be this good come World Cup…
Muy bien Mexico tremendo partido .
France punished for Napoleon's misdeeds
Who would've  thought, getting actual quality players in your team usually win games....geniuses those Mexican soccer administrators.
France  wasn't  even competition
They need better woman pundits... im not against it... just need better
When Mexico scores, you need to scream, " GOALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL............!!!!", instead of, "and Mexico gets the advantage."
Cuando Ginac es mas Mexica que los de Mexico
Sheesh, D list announcers.
Nice! Search here for (Rockcandy Live In Toronto 1988) featuring Buffalo Music Hall of Fame singer song writer Jose Anes!  Also search here for (Sucker For a Pretty Face) by RockCandy, it's a great under rated rare 80s album! Enjoy the music!
Can’t stand the commentators voice
Mexico scored the only real goals
Wtf what who playing gold cup 🏆
Jesus....Mexico looked really sharp!
What kind of shiet is this ? Where is team A France ?
France has been Africanized.
Estos mexicans are watching videos of astro brasilian RONAldihno GaUcho a horse making goals
Feeling bad for Gignac
This d2 France y'all Pisa relax
IN MEXICO WE CALL THIS PALIZA!
Viva Mexico cabrones!!!
Mexico winning, female announcer, no fans. Worst soccer match ever
People think Liga MX  isn't a top League . But in america it is. Easily top 3 in America Legit this players are starters
this Mexican team looks a lot faster and sharper than the one playing in the Copa Oro right now
mbappe chicken out?
Mexico better do well at these stupid olympics. A lot of players that could be helping them at the Gold Cup are not there.
Memo ochoa  is there
Who are these people plYjng for Le Bleu?
4-1 Mexico 🇲🇽
por eso le dimos duro al trabajo.para ver este partido.hijos dela .ganamos.mexico al 100000000000
Ahuevo 🇲🇽!!!
Did France put US players on?
This team play way better and score beautiful orchestrated goals than the actual Team playing the GOLD Cup and Concacaf Qatar competition
Mexico players are shorter but they can beat any Europe teams!!!!
French goalkeepers are dodgy, including this one
Como siempre Ochoa comiéndose los goles y que aburrida es esta mujer narrando el juego
y henry martin que hacia en el partido,estaba jugando de verdad?
Viva Mexico!
HORRIBLE COMMENTARY
So this is where all the strikers we need in the gold cup are at
Mexico is taking the gold in soccer mark this comment
JESUS CHRIST IS LORD. JESUS CHRIST IS COMING BACK. JESUS CHRIST WANTS YOU. PLEASE GIVE YOUR HEART TO JESUS CHRIST NOW. GO TO CHURCH TODAY. AMEN.ALLELUIA.ALLELUIA.ALLELUIA
Gignac has now dual citizenship, French and Mexican, I wonder how he felt...of course he's professional but, just wondering...
Lainez has the potential to be better than lozano
THANK YOU FOR NOT SPOILING THE WINNER
I can only imagine how good Mexico would be at the senior level if they knew how to properly develop their players.
As a honest Mexico fan I can say this is embarrassing showing off against Frances F team but then lose again a decent squad this is unacceptable
The beneficial tights superficially employ because part superfamily sniff per a repulsive teller. vacuous, green grey grieving guide
There’s like 5or6 players on the Mexican that can be easily starters at the  Asquad on Mexico team
Commentator sucks!
Mexico can be a great team problem is Mexico has their favorites that always screw things up instead of getting a faster & hungrier team they go with the old heads smh
So Mexico's first team vs france's bench players and yall surprise they won 😂😂😂😂
The greedy level compatibly belong because dragon remarkably hand apud a mighty drake. sulky, abiding ghost
Aguevoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo..............................................................
Wow , Mexico’s youth is world class. Superb playing style.
where are the superstars??
Mexico played very well but this was France’s B team 😕
Are all the big teams using their B teams? It's a real question can someone help me? Just don't see any names I recognize.
Tranquilos México aún no ganamos nada paciencia
What a shame Ochoa never got to play for a top team, had he been Argentine or Brazilian he would’ve been over 50M in his prime.
Awesome goals by Mexico. So precise. Definitely medal contenders.
France’s goalkeeper is atrociously bad
They did this with pretty much all Liga Mx players and honestly 70% of the team deserves to play in Europe.
4 de Mayo in France.
So the Olympics has already officially started?
OMG! The whole France team is so bad! The defense is terrible. The defender with jersey #15 is probably the worst in the team.
That penalty is not right.
Who's commentator chick? great job at it
mexico A team vs france D team😭
Ochoa can never have a clean sheet
Commentary sucks balls tho
Mexico played very good!!!
France got out played , Ochoa had like 3 good plays against him but most of the time never in his box, Mexico had play after play touch after touch, this game was amazing, it could’ve been easily way more
Go mexique
The nine john scilly follow because michelle pathohistologically blush off a efficacious mechanic. purring, rabid head
Was this Mexico vs France or Mexico vs Africa....I couldn’t tell. 😆
What time does USA play?
Vamossss👏🏽🇲🇽mexico played amazing France thought they was gonna have it easy😂
Stupid lady commentator
LINEZ KNOW WHERE TO PUT THE BALL!
Mexico
Geez, Ochoa just doesn’t age, does he? It seems like he’s been Mexico’s GK for decades lol
Sucks that Mexico’s U-21 always plays good but once they’re in the elderly team they can’t get beyond the 4th game at the world cups
Lainez getting better
Isn't this supposed to be U-23
Where is pogba?
i cant stand english broadcasters why the fk they dont scream gooooooooooooooooooooooool?
No offense but I can’t get used to a women narrating a football game
Yikes, these announcers make footy super boring.
Alexis Vega al Arsenal!
Cuanto goles de un jugador de las putas gallinas amartillo
Arriba mexico !!
Female announcers ruined watching sports.
I have to thank each and every team it is trying out in the Olympics and I have to thank each country for being in the Olympics I am proud of each and everyone of you all love you all
unavez Aguila siempre aguila Lainez ,cordova orgullos de Mexico
Anyone else realize how these reports when a team makes a goal there like goal and when its a Mexican report its goallllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
It's cool to hear how much they communicate with no fans cheering.
Jugo el nuevo refuerzo de tigres?? Dónde que no lo ví!! Jajaja
Tragatela gignac !!
Arriba las chivassss cabroncitos  ANTUNA ANTUNA 👍🇲🇽
Man that mexico kit looks sooooooooooo good that’s why i love Mexico they come up with absolute historic designs for kits! Viva mexico!
18 # comedown African French 🤣
This will be the squad to quatar 2022 just add Edson Alvarez tecatito , raul Jimenez , hh, and of course Chucky Lozano
Pinche Lainez!!No me sorprende y todavia le falta🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
where can i buy the mexico jeresy at
Clientasos !
El dia que Mexico proirize el juego sobre el dinero el fut mexicano crecera. Lastima que que es lo mismo con el pais
Great showing by the under 23 team! ⚽️ 💪🏼 😎
Great game
Mexico played awesome here
Wow.olympic surprises.congratulations mexico.
Everyone talking about lainez but Antuna Cordova and Vega are definitely top players along Lainez don't know why therye not given starting spot in the A team
At this point with over 40 millions Spanish speakers in the US, when the commentators will pronounce the players last names correctly? Córdova, not Cordova
These commentators dookie
Grande mex 🇲🇽
Lainez great arriba mexico senores
🇲🇽 X 🇧🇷
Mexico representado America
Making Tim Howard look like a great commentator
Wtf mexico had their best goalkeeper and othere good players but france didnt play wit grizmen mpape pogba wtf
Mexico for GOLD!!
Lainez>>> USMNT
Vamos Mexico!
The Mexican U23 seems to have better strategy then their regular team.  To little Mexico, every victory over a WC giant is championship final.
Yo pensaba que Francia aún siendo un plantel C o D iba a dar mucho más pero me sorprendió lo mediocre que jugaron, pareciera que a la federación francesa de fútbol no le interesa este torneo olímpico
Very impressive win for MEX but I gotta ask if this is just a crappy crop of Frenchies?
Para que se eduquen ...... marcy
Mexico :" they're not sending their best.. " hahahaha
Tranquilos, no se debe cantar victoria. Si, Francia es/era un favorito, pero en este juego cedió mucho. México siempre serás favorito en las categorías menores pero falta que todo acabe y que ojalá México saque el oro.
Heeeeeeeeey Bruto de francia😀
People counting these games? 💀 france not even using their B U23 team 💀 camavinga alone would’ve ran circles around this team
These commentators fucking suck, Spanish commentators way better. seems like NBC bought all the right to olympics. RIP Telemundo.
I like how Diego Lainez is evolving in the pitch.
Lainez watch out for him bro
Mexico with the best uniforms!
Can someone explain how this a U-23 match but Gignac and Ochoa (and others too I’m missing) were allowed to play? I’m guessing there’s a rule I’m missing
Empezando con el pie derecho y espero que no se confíen y sigan poniéndole mas fuerza los jugadores de la selección mexicana :) !!!
It's literally unwatchable with girl announcers annoying voice. Please stop.
Gicnac es un lobo vestido de oveja dice ser mexicano pero disfruta atacar a nuestra selección
Let’s hear the excuses for France
Let’s go 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Gignac is already use to lose against Mexicans
Alexis Vega el mejor! Y por mucho
lainez es lo mejor que mexico tiene. no la cagen
Mexico shuts everyone's mouth up again! France World Champs my A$$.
Dang… Mexico is looking good in Tokyo.  Hope they can keep it up
2:34 anyone else notice blur playing in the background
Im getting 2010 vibes when mexico and france and south africa and Uruguay was in the group but instead of Uruguay its japan
Omg!! It's that guy calling a soccer game or a golf match.....ufff
Bien hecho Mexico!!!
Man.. if it's not a latino/a announcing its just boring AF!
k putisaaa mexico imparable 😎
Pinche ochoa! No mames! Pinche coladera!!!! Solo por que eres de televisa donde quiera te meten! Pero todos los mexicanos savemos que no vales madre!!!!
Mexico vs Brazil in final watch 😬🤫
Hay que creer  en nuestro team  y yo creo en mi Mexico lindo ❤
USA Fans punching the air right now 😂
Wtf france?? Really mexico haha
Brazil will beat them its obvious
I hope a majority of the young players in this squad end up in Europe after the Olympics, only then could Mexico have a chance at having a competitive squad for international tournaments
Go Mexico!!!!
gignac le mete goles a ochoa en locales y internacionales 🤣🤣
Australia beats Argentina and now this? So many upsets already
Commentators are booty!  Nothing like our Latinos, they passionate about the sport!
Great start!!! Mexico and Brazil the only ones putting 4 in the net of some big teams like Germany and France. CMON MEXICO!!🇲🇽🔥
Go Mex!
This aint the real mexico tho all they have is ochoa and antuna
That 3rd got me like ÓRALE WEEEYYYY
Sweet victory for Mexico beating Afrance!!!
Batalla de puebla 2 :v
Gignac actually plays in Mexico 🇲🇽 🇫🇷
France is a disgrace these players will not even make France team c
Mexico’s kit.🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We’re is mbappe
Vamos mexico!!!! 🇲🇽
In the land of the rising Sun, ( With Ochoa on goal, and the firepower that Mexico has in the midfield and forward positions. I can say with confidence that it will be the Aztecas who will bring the Gold medal back to Mexico.
Giñac only good player in France
Viva Mexico  🇲🇽!!!
Wtf a penalty seriously??
Female commentator....had to mute it
Better than the copa oro team 😂
Couldnt stay awake til 3am
Watch the full game Mexico really demo France but I do see lots of weakness in Mexico France couldn't capitalize on Mexico is good but they really gotta watch out for the empty spots they leave when they attack
Olympics are not important only when your team loses 🤡😂😂
🇲🇽 🇲🇽
OCHOA SUCKSSSSSSS!!!!!1 EHHHH PUT000000000000
Back to Covid bubble land
American soccer announcers are the worst .
THE MEXICAN BOYS....  they know... Lainez is a stud..  WAIT THE USA DEFENDER... Mazda or Miatta LOL... the dude has no team to play, yet he tried to embarrass Lainez in the game USA vs Mexico, a few years back... I will not mention his name, because he is irrelevant. LAINEZ>>>  is a stud. well done boys!  well done.
Como dijo el ferras, ahora la bebes oh la derramas
Woooow viva Mexico cabronees
Mexico dominates match! Announcers destroy performance! As impressive as Mexico was these announcers are f-in terrible.
People saying this is Frances C team reminder most of the French players play in Europe meanwhile Lainez is the only player that plays in Europe for mexico everybody else plays in the Mexican League
No fans. Weird
Right better attackers! And much better defenders. The only thing olympics team lacks I saw was control of the ball.
Santos Laguna 💚🤍💚🤍 the best farm system in the liga mx hands down they just keep pumping out very solid and fundamentally sounds players
For those saying it’s against Frances d team, most if not all the players in the France team play in Europe while the whole Mexico team except lainez play in the Mexican league.
I had to turn off the sound of my 📺 cause can’t stand this woman voice!!
Lainez, antuna and Vega are the future for Mexico line them up with Lozano and that’s a deadly offense
eh france was never really known for soccer anyways
VIVA MEXICO CABRONES!
Gignac don’t celebrate because he loves Mexico he’s kids are half Mexican
This was worth being awake 1:00am in the morning vamos Mexico let's get that gold medal viva Mexico
When did México get sooooooo good?
Lainez, Cordova, Vega, and Antuna are insane they all need to be in Europe
Fransua no la pelo toda.👍🇲🇽⚽
why doesnt france take the olympics serious ? what is this squad?
Damm Lanier be god mode this year ngl😳
Nice to see a concacaf side destroying Euros.
where is mbappe
Ou sont-ils les Francais ????
Lainez crack I been saying it
Esó
Mexicos future is bright
Pinché coladera Ochoa , siempre se le pasa el balón entre las manos o las patas
these commentators are blah
Tim Howard smh 🤦🏽‍♂️
ong I’ve never heard of these French players and I’m just so confused on what team the goalkeeper plays for 💀
🇲🇽🇲🇽🤍🤍
No mames me quedé dormido ya pal segundo tiempo, pero pinches golazos que se echaron.
Mexico brought their starting goalie lmao??
The France defense gave away two goals and could have done better on the other two. Did not do Gignac any justice, as a Mexican I wanted him to score at least two goals😥
thank you for not spoiling the result on the title
Lol Ochoa was expecting a hard penalty kick that he over committed. He needs to chill.
Honestly I’m glad there’s no fans so the ref doesn’t have to stop the game every two minutes because of the Mexico fans being “hurtful”😂😂
The capable mouse analytically notice because caterpillar fifthly approve above a alluring smoke. permissible, efficacious turnover
lets go México 🇲🇽
Terrible announcer. Sound muted.
Estos franceses  creen que con la camiseta le iban a ganar a México  se veían sobrados .a lo mejor no sabían  que México es campeón  en esta categoría
Calling henry martin was an absolute waste
Bruh anyone else getting the vibes that this B team would be doing better than the A team in the gold cup
Wow 🤩  Mexico 🇲🇽
We all love tacos! Viva Mexico 🇲🇽 !!!
France went cheap and thats what they got🥴🔥 Viva Mexico!!🔥🔥
What’s crazy is that Mexico , France , and SA were all in the same group back in the WC 2010.
Honestly this should be the World Cup squad.
Mexico fans after one win, we are winning Gold!! After a loss we are the worst team ever I’m surprised we even made it this far. Everybody needs to calm down it’s just one 1 good momentum going forward.
I didn’t know Mexico was handing out vaccinations 💉 hahaha because France definitely got the Mexican one haha
Mexico for the gold 🇲🇽
Chingón por México!!!! Aunque el portero de Francia es más malo que el cólera
umm I think Mexico might win the gold.....might see a Mexico and Brazil final perhaps????
No que México no traia,nada???para todos los que menosprecian lo nuestro,hai esta faitelson tu Francia superior,a México que nos hiba a golear con gignac,!!!!!!tómala barvon!!!!!
This isn’t Frances a team but it’s still cool to see that France now has to put some decent players next time I know Mexico isn’t the best but I love seeing them play vs the best bc it’s more fun but this is Mexico’s better team then the other tournament literally this team still beat A France team not best one but still the other team that’s playing in the other tournament almost tied against El Salvador yes El Salvador witch is bad but hey we still got the dub ig
" but but but they played against France s team" not mexicos fault, they went and did the job. Mexico is taking this tournament seriously they want the gold and if they keep this same energy they might repeat what happened in 2012. I feel this squad is even more talented than back then
What France is this? Am pretty sure it’s not the second or even the third team in France
Ya es cliente
MEXICO!!!!!!! 🇲🇽🤘🏽
The American announcers are the worst at announcing a Futbol Game!
Mexico's has a chance to win 🥇
Thauvin and Gignac both starting against Mexico is so nice to me idk why
We love you 🔥🔥
Male commentator has no emotion. This isn't golf
This Mexico team beat Brazil
They can beat France 4-1 but can’t score more than one goal against El Salvador
Respect to Gignac after his goal
Mexico's goal were class
Remember when France try to invade Mexico
🤜🏽🤛🏽🔥🔥🇲🇽 🇫🇷
I’m very happy for the team!! But for the casual fans who ruin it for everyone else and always put ridiculous expectations on our national team;  You do realize this is Mexico’s B team and Francés literal D- team right? Please don’t blow things out or proportion.
France looks shook
Mexico did an excellent performance with an unexpected score.
Sheshhhh  🇲🇽   Arriva la razaaaa
Viva méxico cabrones‼️ 🇲🇽
Antuna’s goal was badass
ennnn donde estaaan? en donde están? esos frances que nos ivan a ganaaaar? 🇲🇽🇲🇽
These mexicant's win one game and think their the champions already
I swear this is the commentator that be commentating the denver Broncos😂
If France is bringing gignac  you know they don't care about this lol
Can this be mexico A team??!??!! And of course SOME player playing in the gold cup
The innocent action endoscopically miss because sound kelly guarantee under a unwieldy poppy. lopsided, murky package
I love how most of these mexican players play in liga mx😍
Antuna in the Mexican national team is completely different than Antuna in chivas.
Bruh...... Only if we could do this in the world cup.... 😧
Great game and confidence boost for Mexico for the rest of the tournament
Viva Mexico cabroooooones
Mexico.could of.score another 2 easily.
Gignac didn’t even try because he was mad he couldn’t make it into the mexico squad 😞
USA 🇺🇸: Mexico scores, Mexico gets the advantage. Mexicans 🇲🇽: Goooooooooooool, Golazooooooooo!!!!!
Arriba las Chivas putos
Mbappe ghosted🤡
Lainez come to the premier league
wheres griezmann, mbabbe, pogba?
Serious or not A win is a win and we’ll take them everytime let’s go Mexico
BRAVO!!!!!!!!
Centralamericans be hating tho😅🤭
This mexico team performed way better than the seleccion they run in the gold cup
MEXICO ALWAYS REPPING FOR CONCACAF 🗿🇲🇽🦾
Every Mexican who watches Mexican football knows Gignac, even if he’s a French player lol.
Mexico beat Africa today.
Come on🇲🇽 let’s win this Olympics
What time is the US playing? Oh yeah that’s right 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Je n'ai vu Gignac qu'en équipe de France.🤦🏻‍♂️
Let’s fucking go
Con que gane uno de latino américa Vamos todo mis latinos hermanos!!!! Let's beat our European brothers 🇲🇽🇸🇻🇬🇹🇨🇺🇵🇷🇳🇮🇺🇾🇦🇷🇧🇷🇨🇴
This is France? I’m confused i mean
I smell Mexico vs Brazil on final again just like the 2012🇲🇽🇲🇽
Antuna y vega 2 chiva hermanos
Antuna and Lainez are making mexico proud
Viva Mexico Cabrones 💯
it’s Cinco de Mayo for France all over again
Este partido era una trapeada de piso que le pusieron a Francia! Que paso?
Wow !!lainez serve with the right foot ? Getiing better for sure 🇲🇽
Why can’t Mexico be this good in the World Cup?
Ochoa man always plays good for Mexico but ok for america 😂
Esta Francia qué weee 😂
2020 ?
imagine if we had chucky 😳🥵
I’m Mexican and celebrate for México won but RESPECT for andre pierre gignac! He didn’t take a celebrate goal.
Anyone else find the girls commentary mind numbing ? Seems forced.
Pero que pues con Henry Martin?  Si Mexico quiere ganar la medalla de oro Martin va tener que coperar con goles!
France had all his team Mexico will be destroyed
Te AMO mi México lindo y querido ❤ 🇲🇽
Viva mexico 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
Mexico having a good chance of making it to the final!
EZ CLAP
Alot of salt in these comments, sheesh people
France look like sh*t lmaoooo
Vamoooos Mexico
Mexico is trash.
All these Mexicans bragging to the high heavens makes me laugh 😂 not even the Australians were bragging about beating ARGENTINA 😂
🇲🇽 Keep the same energy playboys 🇲🇽
Bro is this Olympic team better than our main gold cup team 😂 bro no way
The girl that’s talking is trying to hard
Viva Mexico cabrones 🇲🇽
Why can’t Mexico translate this form to a World Cup.
Mexico bien bravoooo
Vamos Mexico!
Mexico's Olympic team much better than Gold Cup team.
France was buck broke
Why is ochoa even on this squad why doesn't a younger GK play
Viva MÉXICO 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽No 1, o 2, o 3, sino 4 Goles pa’ comenzar🇲🇽Felicidades a los jugadores mexicanos! Gracias por la alegría! Honor a quien honor merece🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
that french goalkeeper is terrible XD
VAMOOOOOSSSSS!!!🇲🇽🇲🇽
🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽💯🇲🇽
No results in the title? Have a like!
Ochoa is not 23 😂
Horrible commentary
We need them in the Gold cup.
Gignac and thauvin plays in México league
Uriel antuna 🧨🥶
Yeah¡¡ we were going to second gold in soccer
France looked absolutely HORRENDOUS. But this was their Z team so you would kinda expect that
😩 I don’t like her as the play by play….I think she would be great as the color commentator though. It’s not because she’s a girl either.
Antuna💎🤟🏽🤙🏾🇲🇽🦂
This France team was trash. Also Martin sucks
french farmer teams throughout the summer 🤣🤣🤣
Have to watch this on mute, this female commentator is terrible.
Congratulations to Mexico!
France should bring on the cleaner to goal keep, couldn't do any worse
If we combine this squad with the gold cup squad Mexico looks pretty good for the next World Cup
I'm Mexican but we overrated.
Orale!!!! Viva Mexico!!!!
These comments are so cringe
Lainez crack 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
fabien barthez came out of retirement?   Wow, best I’ve ever seen him play.
The Future Is Bright The Future Is Bright The Future Is Bright The Future Is Bright
💚🇲🇽❤️
france without africans can't win
These young Mexican players have played first team football a lot longer than the French players and it showed. Be careful who you underestimate.
Montes and Vazquez have to replace Salcedo and Moreno for world cup qualifiers. Most of these kids should be stealing first team spots too
English commentary is so hard to listen to 😭
the reason why mexico won is because where was all the france superstars
Good luck Mexico!
Isn’t it U23?? Why is Ochoa playing if he is 36 years old??
That penalty was a big flop
This must be the third group of French team.
English commentary is so boring compared to the spanish commentary lol
Lets go Mexico !! vamos Mexico eso es todo buena goliza
En donde estan esos frances que nos ivan a ganar🤷‍♂️🤠 viva Mexico c@brones! 🇲🇽
Usa fans punching the air thinking they have the best future in concacaf
Debut Aniquilador
Vamos por otra de oro 🇲🇽
Let’s go let’s go 🇲🇽 Mexico
Could have easily been Mexico 8 to France’s 1. Send this U23 to Qatar.
France B Team
Oh wow this Mexican team plays better than the one playing in the Copa de oro
Quite sad el salvador did better than france
And usa and central Americans thought mexico is not the giant of concacaf anymore lmao xD.  U just saw mexico destroy France 4 1 what else concacaf nation is capable of doing that. Exactly nobody else.  Viva mexico! :D. The still and always giant of concacaf.
English commentary is so boring 🤣
🇲🇽🤫 🇲🇽
Mexico; the best team in the americas
Lmao all i am seeing in these comments are some salty excuses jajajajajaj VIVA MEXICO
A Mexico la vale madre si juega contra dos paises Francia y sus africanos y le mete 4 jugando a gran nivel.
A huevo perros
I'm sorry but who tf is Frances gk?
That was good
5 de Mayo  again
That was Frances 3rd team. Come on guys ... not even close to their best squad
LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 4-1
Japan will definitely be a challenge!
i love how ochoa is too good and is used to hard penalties so he overdove it
Aaa
The French players all like WTAF after the Antuna goal.
So who won
Vive le Mexique!!!
Que tipo de Francia es este... el arquero solo quedaba viendo no. No no es rival
World Cup 2026, Mexico will have a super team with this Olympic squad 🔥
Mexico's starting 11 are all starters for their team. They each have over 100 professional games under them. I believe they'll win it.
Ochoa sucks! He never catches the ball and only starting due to corruption.
EL TEQUILA VENCIO AL CHAMPAGNE
What sucks about Mexico is that they always excite fans like myself when it comes to young talent (u23), but fail to live up to the hype when they get older and play in major tournaments (like the World Cup). I thought in 2005, after winning the u17 World Cup, we were set  ……
What made it better was Ross narrating the game.
When we win it’s always Mexico has great promising players or this is their A team blah blah blah. Lol then when we lose they’ll be like Mexico’s overrated and has trash players 😂
France is turning into Germany after winning the 2018 WorldCup.
lainez gives me Gnabry vibes... especially since Gnabry showed up his skills 2016 olympics. we will see if Lainez have a better chance in a new club
Good mach for México Vamos mexicoo a huevoo.👏👏
FALTO GRESMAN Y PBAPE...
wait...where is Giovanni and Marquez :D
If that wasn't the best team for France,  why were they favorite to win.
Idk but that French goalie needs to get subbed he soooooo baddddd
We’re gonna have a replay of 2012 Olympic final. Mexico vs Brazil 🔥
Mexico always beating European teams, France,Germany, Croatia, Netherlands, etc. We fear no European team.
Narrator sucks!!!!
Mexico 🇲🇽 will win the gold
OCHOOOAAAA
For all the casuals saying this is France's B team or whatever. Understand everyone is playing their U-23 squad. Give credit where it's due, mexico won and dominated. Another thing since y'all wanna say the Olympics aren't important. Yes they are in the long term. These players are learning about competition and that's what makes great teams like Spain Germany and Brazil Argentina so good. They play in any tournament they can get into and give these players experience
Great start for Mexico hope they continue that’ same energy!!!!!
Where are all the actual france players?  Anyways viva Mexico
No supieron ni por donde les paso la banda😂😂😂😂😜😜
No era penal!!!
El Vega está imprecionando
Viva Mexico 🇲🇽
Why everyone thinks mexico playing with there A team lol its the sub 23 who they playing with &only 3 reinforcements
Can Mexico go back to wearing green jerseys?! Since when was it a thing to wear black & pink, Adidas needs to stop playing with our true colors, concacaf teams see green and trust me it’s intimidating
Giñac playing for France against Mexico is so fun since he usually plays with a Mexican team.
Ahuevo! Vamos Tri!!
First: Premier League Second: Euro 2020 And now, the olympics HOW IS TIM HOWARD COVERING ALL THIS WITHOUT SLEEEP!
The copium in the comments lol don't try and discredit Mexico lol
Were both teams using their A teams?
I would have liked to see Efrain Alvarez in the Olympic squad rather than the Gold Cup. Sooner rather than later he should make the move to Liga MX. A good stepping stone for an eventual move to Europe.
I've never seen France playing so bad. What a waste of a team.
Mexico taking the GOLD 🥇
90 percents of those players are legit starters for theirs clubs in Mexico … that’s the difference
For those not giving credit to Mexico's U23, they trashed a group of players who are starters in a 'superior' league and with a few who play in great performing sides.   Mexico had a dominant display.
Great to see this.  Great skill by Mexico. Europe does not own soccer.
Why r there no spectators
It's like mexico plays better without an audience.... 😭
This new players are actually good , time to change the main team,.except Lozano he's a beat 😁
Mexico so underrated  Respect 🤝
Venga MEXICO 🇲🇽!
Mexico is the only team that takes Olympic soccer like a World Cup. The rest of the world can give 2 craps about it.
It's France b team. Calm down Mexico fans
Thats wasnt even the real french team😂😂
Alexis Vega reminds me of Jesus Corona
If only it was the actual France team that faced Mexico’s first team we all knew what the score would have been lol
Hopefully most of this team replaces the  top national team
Vamos mi mexico 🇲🇽. Vamos por esa medalla
This is b squad of France....not their real team
How has Ochoa not at one of the bigges clubs in the world? He is obviously top keeper for 10 years now, just save after save after save...
Le gardien français est un agent de sécurité je le know 😀
Lainez  🐐
Fantastico 🤙🏽
Mexico is always the Cinderella dream
Anyone notice lainez getting better this year ? He’s delivering more it’s exciting
Que baile!
French Youth and C team
🧐🥳
Lainez great player.
So beautiful 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
These female commentators wack sorry 🤷🏽‍♂️
Giñac ws la meea 🐐
🦅 + 🐐 = 🥇
Mexico at the moment has two A teams, but we all know this Olympic team is better and faster than the A team playing the gold cup right now in the U.S.
France wither their u-23 D team
Lainez > Pulisic
Mexico were the underdogs, everybody said Mexico had no chance and now.. 🤫🤫
Who here for daddy lainez?😩🇲🇽🥇
I felt bad for the French goalkeeper 😂 he thought it was going to be easy peasy lemon squeezy
Nice
lmao france gonna claim racism? lol
2020?
So we basically wc champions. 🥱🇲🇽
Viva mexico 🇲🇽🇲🇽🇲🇽
