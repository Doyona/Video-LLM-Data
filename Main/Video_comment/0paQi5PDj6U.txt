Tyson Fury knocked him out and was like oh no you don't 😂😂 Austin Theory sure Failed his Mission lol 🤣
Tyson fury is a class
He looks thin here lol
A TOWN DOWN!
You gotta give Austin theory his flowers.
suckerpunch
Here from CVV. Theory sold that punch like any other boxer that just got rocked, lol.
I remember that so well, Clash at the Castle was an amazing event
Boxer ‼️‼️‼️
🤣🤣
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😊
Tyson fury embarrassing himself.
Lol 😅😂
He really said acknowledge him!
0:24,0:28 - TYSON FURY just knocked the hell out of Theory.
To prevent A-town Austin theory from cashing in the money in the bank breif case Pat duh!
Bro sold the fencing response
Tyson fury appearing to stop theory with no further appearances is hilarious
Fury is much better suited to all that nonsense.
Why would he do that
Fun fact: I was there
لماذا اصبح اوستن ثيروي شخصية ضعيفة الان لما كان فينس كان واجهة الشركة للأسف تريبل اتش دفن اوستن ثيوري
Imagine if Theory actually successfully cashed in
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Man the selling of the punch by Theory is historical
😂😂It appears that Austin Theory fell into a coma after punching Tyson Fury
Why did he do that
Theory faces the Fury 😂😂
" WHAT THE HELL'D HE DO THAT FOR?!?!?!"
Theory sold that punch was gold 🔥👊
I don't think that was fake😂
0:20  THEORY FAILED THE CONTRACT CASH-IN 🤣🤣
Thank you,Tyson fury 👏👏 what a KO
Corey Grave ask Tyson Fury why he did that.
Leon Edwards just chilling too
I love this well done to Fury  for doing  what  I would love to do to Austin Theory
0:25. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
thought it was an actual fan😂
bad luck
Real Punch vs WWE Stop 0:27 pls!!!
0:26
We hate Tyson Fury
He gave him a KO when theory was legally cashing in his MIB  But he did nothing when Solo came out to help Roman🤣🤣
Tyson and Austin! Tyson and Austin! Tyson and Austin!
Panchi is powerful and worst ever MITB Austin Theory😂😅win
I liked that Tyson Fury punched 🤜 Austin Theory from cashing in 💰
Rollins didn't beat lesnar Cole lol
The moment that punch landed, Fury became a national treasure 😂😂
this was actually funny lol
Roman Reigns 💓
Corey Graves at 0:33 "What the hell did he do that for?!" I told myself "You know why. To stop Theory from cashing in and ruining a great main event."
As soon as Theory told the ref "I wanna cash this in.", Fury jumped right up out of his chair and just shut Theory's lights out. I very much applaud Fury for what he did.
He disurve this punch 😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Tyson suck
Me in the back of my mind: Tyson and Austin! Tyson and Austin!
Waouuu  fury is wonderfur i love you❤
😂😂😂
Theory should get a oscar
Tyson Fury be like I will let him nahhh👊💥 Austin theory 😴
Why did Tyson Fury ruin Austins moment!
What a crowd!
😂😂😂😂😂
This isn't Tyson fury
Theory sell is amazing. Yall need to stop hating his for bogus false rumor reasons.
He got a decent pop coming out
That was good. I have to admit.
Theory sells it SO WELL.  FURY is what got me hooked on WWE when he fought Strohman!
Ha theory
So he wasted it on a midcard title which is the stupidest thing he ever did.
Theory should have won at Clash of the Castle. MITB value has downgraded after he lost.
Theory suck weak
Outta nowhere😂😂😂😂
This was moment when i assumed it he'll be buried for the future
From cashing in for the world title to cashing in for the us title Theory went though a heck of a evolution 😂
Theory had a good pop here
I would like to see the almighty Bobby Lashley versus the tribal chief the head of table Roman Reigns at Wrestlemania 39 for the undesputied universal champion
*theory cashes in*   Crowd: oh no    Tyson fury ko theory*   Crowd: YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
Paid actor all of them
0:25 I think someone forgot to tell Tyson Fury that this thing is fake LOL
Fury punched passed him and bumped Theory with his chest to make him go down and make the punch look more real. Great entertainment though
I was there live when it happened and I said the C word so many times in front of some 10 year old kids. I couldn't have been more happier still
TYSON AND AUSTIN! TYSON AND AUSTIN!
1998- Mike TYSON vs Steve AUSTIN 2022- TYSON Fury vs AUSTIN Theory
Furys an amazing seller he made it look like he actually got knocked tf out
Shelbi sunseri
Theroy shouldn't have the briefcase anymore
Austin theory vs tyson fury at crown jewel should happen and love it when austin theory was selling that jaw injury when he did his promo
What a right hand
Who else had to replay this video to see how Tyson knocked out theory with that solid punch
Damn theory got chin checked 😂
Theory is the future
from the time between “a town” until tyson knocking him out i was 100% sure the reign was gonna end
he redeems it at WrestleMania
Childish nonsense
0:26
Last time was f5 now the knocked out🥊😂
I think someone forgot to tell Tyson this was fake lol
Austin theory and Corey graves I wanna take them to suplex city
I just love it. Fury boxing fan here. The Americans know how to entertain. Love it
Tyson save Roman reigns title
🤣👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Next PPV, Francis Ngannou is in the front row and handles Theory.
Sold it better than Wilder
Theory has amazing mic skills..
He really should be escorted out for fan interference I call shenanigans
WWE is such a Reality TV scam. Slo-mo Fury's "punch" 0:25 - 0:26 and you will see Fury never connects! His "punch" goes *behind* the head of his target. As with everything else in WWE, it is just an act. If these fights were real, Braun Strowman with a 30 Kg weight advantage and experience in WWE would have beaten Fury convincingly. I get that it is all about cross-promotion and exposing the "sport" to a wider audience, but I just can't watch it knowing that everything is scripted in advance. REAL sport is not scripted and pre-determined.
What a right hand by Tyson Fury! Just knocks Austin Theory out clean!
The ‘Oh My God’ by Corey Graves was a great sell, if you watched the full match, that line was perfect bro, ALSO the starting of his theme is a great pop song
Tyson punched Austin. Seen it before 😂
Good thing he gets paid well. Imagine getting to work and the boss saying “oh and for you, you’re gonna take a punch from the most dominant boxer of this generation” 😂
Theory  you just got knocked out
Tyson Fury had a great match with Braun Strowman back in 2019, great to see him back in WWE 🙌
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
NICE ONE TYSON FURY
After Daddy Not Hare, their Child so uncomfortable & Unsafe 😅😅😅😅😅
Ha ha ha ha ha 👍😁
you know whats funny if you replay at 0:25 in slow mow you can sit Tyson didn't punch theory in the face he threw a punch over his neck to make it look like he got KO.
I wonder when he would cash-in the briefcase
Looked like a rabbit punch. No wonder he went down like that.
Tyson wants Austin! Austin wants Tyson!
You failed theroy
two minutes silence for theory😂😂😂😂😂
I know he knew he would get punched but imagine how good he felt while running down with everyone screaming lol.
Funny seeing the pop given they ain’t even in the US. Makes me think people are sick of Roman being champ.  Or maybe they wanna see a cash in. I’m ready for Austin Theory to have a successful cash in! He’s got everything you want as a heel. The future is bright with that guy.
Fury won’t do that to usyk tho
"what the hell did he do that for?!?" even the Gypsy King knocked the F--K out of Cockroach Theory 😄
Nobody told me Theory's theme song was that fire!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Austin theory sold that punch like hot pancakes
Roman reings vs drew mclyntyre not interesting match interesting match is Roman reings vs the rock
I think by far Theory has the most historically failed MITB cash-ins before he even attempts to 🤣
I don’t even understand what happened here. Why did he hit him? I
Oh wow, he had to give the ref the case, right in front of Fury. Who knew that would happen
theroy will be the first and last guy in wwe who could never cashed it in. 😅
shooooosh Austin is a cutie
Whatever be the case I feel bad for theory....everyone mocks him and makes fun of him...and tbh hes a one man army...hope he gets the chance to cash in the contract
i wonder, if this was a real knock out
he is in the right spot 🤣
Is he’s name gonna change to just Austin now 😂😂
Came here to read comments😂 read it you will enjoy more than watching video😁🤣😂🤣
So if I gave a cheap shot to a wrestler, I'd get mobbed, charges pressed, and banned from events for life; but if a celebrity does it, they get cheered by the audience and left alone by security.   That's sports entertainment for ya.  But really, Austin Theory is pretty dang good.
Ohmg grim please please 🙏
What a punch👊
wrestling is so bad now jesus
"What did you do that for" lmao
hahahahahahahahaha
Word on the street is that Theory owed Fury some lunch money and chose not to pay the tab! Fury unleashed the fury on theory clearly!!! 🥴😉
Gipsy King 💪🏻
What use all glin on about the way theory sold tha, its all real in the wrestling tha wad nockout power
Set playback speed to 0.25x. The punch didn't even connect. Great selling by Theory though.
why did he have out there near the barricade instead of standing near the ring to cash out wtf
That man is 0 in 2 on cash in so far lol
That was setup because he just went straight to him
Quick punch. No words exchanged.  Back to business.
Theory got knocked the f*** out🤣🤣🤣. He will be feeling that punch for quite some time
hahah bigger draw than AJ , come on hahah GK THE GOAT Not watched WWE since i had smackdown 2 on ps1. you have a fan again
Ya theory is a punk he deserves what he gets
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 bammmmm
the unfairness of wrestling: when spectators are allowed to interfere with or influence match-ups
That was funny
I know this scripted lol I’m real life Tyson woulda got a fine by the boxing ent
I want to find that punch in a loop that's funny as hell
why theroy going to that place......total scripted
A town
Tyson Hard hitter shot to theory. He never expected that.
This kid got yeeted
Assault?
need a subscription from a kind person, does anyone like the sports athlete channel, I have the history, let's stop by my friend
😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
💥 what a right hand
I don’t even want to know the story line here. Watching this with zero context is absolutely hilarious.
Bayardo
Jinder mahal vs Roman reigns
Austin theory need some momentum
My guy Austin didn’t deserve that.
That punch is necessary :)))
Fake
Not theory just practical 🤣🤣🤣
Dear All, Lord Jesus Christ is the Only Way to Heaven. Repent & accept him as your personal Saviour. He will accept you as his child. See you in Heaven. God Bless.. ❤️
I wonder if things like that when a crowd member is scripted to play a part in a match if they have to keep it to themselves fury's family would have been sat there clueless as to what he is about to do lol
He knocked the hell out him up
WWE become so fake that he goes at commentary side so that tyson can hit punch comeon wwe make some good script  very bad script 😂😂
Scripted.. as usual
He sold it like a champion Love Theory 😂❤️
wrestlemania will be the time where theory steal the belt
Wish he really knocked him out haha. Long live the gypsy king 👑💪👊
MITB cash-in still in theory....
🤣🤣🤣
00:25 goodnight Theory!
Only Seth Rollins can do
Unlucky theory 😂😂😂😂
Lol i love how Tyson made looked like he just thought off the fly to KO theory 🤣🤣
All tongue in cheek comedy with bad actors and awfully staged knockouts. WWE at its best 😂😂😂😂
that looked real, the stiff arms was the best 🤣
😂😂😂
Legend had it that theory is still out cold… to this day
Wow that is awesome to watching the kids Ben bet up. That is so exactly what  he needs.  Some  one to put  him in place
I think theory will retire with the contract😂😂😂😂😂
💖💖💖💖
Playback speed .25 he punches behind his head hitting nothing but air.  Austin Theory sold that punch like an actor, give this man an Oscar, he deserves it!!
How is feel theory punch 👊👊🤣🤣
Tyson fury was enjoying the match like us and this idiot show up what did he expect?
Tyson we are love in INDIA country...
The hero we needed AND deserved 😆
IS TRUE KOREAN O TALKING ABOUT ROMAN REIGNS A TIDAL
Say goodnight Austin
Good job. Serves him right
Theory deserved that. I would have done the same thing.
Austin Theory as the youngest champion is a disgrace to WWE
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Funy ans mony
JR: TYSON, TYSON, TYSON... RIGHT HAND
I love people reaction when the "A town" sounds
theory is way overrated
Was watching this love and it was just so unpredictable/unexpected. Very good stuff
This was very nice Tyson 💪🐺🤣👍
Yeah the way he sold that was epic. Kudos
The man is box office and the most important heavyweight since Tyson
So he came all the way to that place and as per script got punched..
If Tyson Fury really hit Theory, then he could have criminal charges on him !!!! People paid good money to see this in person and on pay per view, he ruined Theorys chances of getting a title !!!!! Even if he didn't really hit him, he should have charges pressed on him !!!!! Next time Tyson Fury gets in the ring Theory should attack him, you would see how quickly security would stop Theory from entering the ring !!!!! Theory shouldn't have run over to that direction and just jumped in the ring, so FAKE !!!!!!!!
.... "The People Punch" 😂😂😂💪🤜🤛👊👊🤪😇
Best moment of the event. Didn’t see it coming and laughed so much. Great entertainment.
The way Theory sold that punch and acted like he went stiff was golden
Hearing Austin’s first name makes me happy
Cringe.. As long as tyson gets paid he don't care.
😂😂😂
This made this match to me what an incredible fake out 😂
Should have knocked out roman reigns cousin Instead  😮😢
Theory has maybe like 2 or 3 more attempts at this and when we least expect it, he’ll make the successful cash in lmao
Jesus Christ 😂😂😂
Perfect moment for drew to win
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
even a pulled punch from Tyson Fury has gotta hurt 😫
Didnt theory cash in his mitb in last brocklesnar v roman reigns match.......??? .. Huh
He wouldn't make it out of Cardiff if he was successful
Its not the hardest punch tha knocks u down, its the one u dont see coming.
If you watch this closely  This was a fix ! AT stood so close to Tyson Fury so he gets that knock and there is a publicity  Else he would have gone to the ring  This is scripted  Don’t watch wwe it’s scripted
Why Austin go there just to get a ko childish script
That pop though when Austin Theory's theme was played.
That’s theory vs fury confirmed for Crown Jewel then
K.O. outta nowhere 🤣
Tyson said, "you ain't ruining this great match."
Fake punch he didn’t even hit him put that on 0.5 speed and you will see the truth
Noice lol  Usyk for the W tho.
So funny lol
The way he sold it was too good lmao
Definitely worth an Oscar 🏆 with that performance
0:25 "YOU'RE RUINING THE SHOW"
Great sequence, Roller coaster of emotions
See the reaction on theory's theme, i thought that no body knows theory but the reaction 😃
Who says it's fake.
right moment the attack other people
Theory has already given us a ton of funny and memorable moments
How come everyone saying masvidal sucker punched Leon makes him a coward but when Tyson does this, everyone backs him up? Comment below you phony fans
That was dope and unexpected 👌 💯
theory will be great face of wwe  like stone cold & john cena
Selling??
Thorey be like : why always me?
Theory got expect the unexpected from Fury.
WELCOME BACK TO WWE, "THE GYPSY KING" TYSON FURY. 👊👊👊
I love Tyson Fury ❤️🤣
one punch one kill 🤣
Nxt time he should put a dog rope to the refree n giving flying kisses patting him all the way to the ring..thats wt it looks like 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
Now come to India Wwe
Verry good kkkkkkk
"TYSON AND AUSTIN!! TYSON AND AUSTIN!!! ALL HELL HAS BROKEN LOOSE"
The enemy of this entire segment is the referee   He already brought you with him  Off course you know he wants to cash in  What are you still receiving instructions for   Poor Theory I'm not his biggest fan but wished he did cash in...
Mothers chod h roman Reigns Dham h to Apne dham jeet kar dikha, Chitiang karke jeetata h
POW! Right in the kisser
Fury knocked out Theory.
The wY he punch theory 🤣  theory dreaming something like he win ud title 🤣
Austin theory 😱😔😂😂😂😭
If fury isn't in jail then its fake..it could be a strong punch but it's staged
What a moment 😁 that I even got up just like the crowd did
No one can take a sucker punch from a heavyweight boxing champ or even a heavyweight boxer and not visit hospital. This is fake and act and its entertainment.
People boo him now but they will be chanting along with his theme “ALL DAY” verse in the future.
Day by day wwe making theory a joke even from the audience 😂😂😂😂only man who runs holding that suitcase and falls on the ground releasing that suitcase after hitting by external forces😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
I see Furry coming to wwe one day
It's so satisfying to watch😂😂😂I bet you have watched it more than 10 times too
Clear they cheated, and still roman winner 😂 mean wwe want the same
If wwe want to keep titles with Roman, I believe matches should be cancelled with roman.
Don't understand how many brothers and helping gand they have 😆
Ye bhosdiwala Tyson fury agr cash in krne deta Austin theory ko to ye roman reings na jitta sara mza khrab kiya is chutiye fury ne😡😡😡
Fury retired after this punch
Since when did he get Austin back in his name
Fury earn thousands of money 💸 by punching theory .just like that
This was purely directed
Good job Tyson Fury 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Theory's theme - You see the future right in front of your eyes At the very next moment - Bam a Punch from Tyson
Fury is a clown
This guy is gonna be great, i swear
So no assault charge then?
Damn..some people really thinks that grandpa can still punch?
Usyk Chemp
I heard “A-time” and was in shock, shame he didn’t get it this time
Shut Up Corey
Everyone was cheering theory to cash in 😀😀
0.06 that pop 😍😍.. one day Austin Therory will be a big champion
Fullllllll scripted haii jha fury tha exactly vhiii gyaa isliye maine dekhna chod diyaa
So hilarious...when you think about it🤣
Disappointed that he didn't also call him a dosser.
I totally thought some random fan hit Theory until it showed who actually hit him. I totally forgot that Michael Cole said Tyson Fury was sitting behind them
good job
Love the storyline of Theory. Everytime he tries to cash in the MIB something bad happens so he isn't able to cash it in lmao
Can't beat the UK fans the energy they bring
Went and stood side on next to Fury oh how convenient. 🤣
Austin theory K.O. Referee obstructed to romans cousins. Roman winning everything by interfernce is just becoming overbearing.
First Brock and Tyson fury whos next to stop cash in 😂😂😂😂😂
One of the Funnist Things i've Seen
That's a Gypsy punch
Alabarlo que vive
Tyson missed. Why did the guy fall over🤣🤣👍
Ko 🥊🥊💫💫💫💤💤💤💤
Stellar. Well done 😆
Thank you Fury.
Funny how Leon Edwards just chilling there recording Fury hitting Theory 😂
Wwe is fake. I will not watch this fake show.
make it a thing. make Austin theory try to cash in his briefcase at every premium live event.  someday, he'll get the win.
Theory 😑🤪🤪🤪🤣🤣
DAM , how many times is Theory gonna “attempt” to cash in . He’ll have that suitcase FOREVER the way this is goin.
Punching bag theory...🤣🤣🤣
Fury isn’t a wwe wrestler so u know that punch was at least 80% real and that HURT lol
FURY be like Saudi I am coming for u 😂
That was out of the sky 😂😂😂 Lol Theory
👍👏👏👏👏🤝🙌🤲🏼🙇‍♂️
Clean
He looks legit KO'd 😂
Theory didn’t see that coming at all..
Looked real
Theory Fury
i'm furious with fury's time management.
Austin can't get a break 😂😂😂
It's truly awesome to see the undisputed heavyweight boxing champion of the world show up in WWE again
wwe is white hot 🔥right now
Let theory cashin in roman vs rock match at mania
BEST MITB SETH ROLLINS LOVE YOU WM 31💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖🤩🤩🤩🤩😍
TYAON KO THEORY 😅😅😅💖💖💖💖💖
Qué nocao 🤣🤣🤣
The fake punch sells seats.
Crowd received theory
My guess is that as long as theory has that briefcase,more than likely this is going to be a recurring theme until wwe decides to ACTUALLY let him cash in.
You know its been long time since i watch wrestling. I dont know any one ever thought of tag team with R Truth and Theory. Call Truth & Theory.
TYSON! TYSON! TYSON!
Theory will cash in       One day
Terrible.
And people still thinks pushing theory was bad idea? The man can sell and act as if it was real, he was annoying heel, can talk and do promos, can be in comical gimmicks, has good finisher.. he is versatile in any ways..
People thought he gonna be the next Cena but he's becoming next miz.. lmao 😂
0:26 Love that
Theory is very funny and creative 😂
I don’t think the punch landed perfectly…but wtf 😳
Sold that KO pretty well
Felicitaciones wwe 💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝
I just love the way Tyson Fury, just seamlessly goes from being the most fearsome heavyweight on the planet to start guest bad man in WWC / WWF American wrestling….
😀😀😀
Theory to beahosh hogaya bacha sala
Drew Deserve Win That Match  now his Title Is Boaring 😌
One man punch lmao 😂😂😂
Danm that arena was packed ! Looks like Tripple H is fixing wwe back to the old days.
yo!! was that a solid punch?
He got a pretty nice reaction though!
This was the true highlight moment
Jajajaja
I'm glad Tyson did it. Theory is never gonna cash that case in. Never.
Austin theory lights were on but no one was home after getting KO punch by Tyson fury  Austin theory will wake up with a headache and wonder what hit him so hard  . I said he deserves it 100% way to go Tyson fury
Tyson knows how to sell himself!👏👏👏
Ko
I liked how the announcer asked, "What did he do that for?"
Well it's a bit of fun  I spose...
Triple is suck let the Roman keep the title
This just sets up for an actual successful cash in one of these days! Gets screwed time after time there’s no way he has a legit failed cash in when the bell rings.
I’m glad this happened
I think Fury legitimatly knocked out Theory. Fury Vs Theory.. Its sounds rhyming
Ain’t een punxh him 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
😂😂😂
That was a classic moment
Theory went down harder than Wilder 🥊
Not gonna lie this was the best part of the show for me 😂 Austin Theory has officially won me over
😅😅😅😅😅
Theory should sue Fury, completely uncalled for
The best 3 things about Clash at the Castle: 1. Gunther vs. Sheamus; 2. Drew "Broken Dreams" prequel to his entrance; 3. Fury KO'ing the lights out of Theory. 😂 Honorable mention: Dominick heel turn.
Am coming to get punched
That was actually some of the better acting I've seen in this garbage lol slowed it down to .25xs to see Fury's hand go behind the neck and not hit the face at all
I feel like theory is never going to cash in the MITB contract
Theory will take the undisputed championship for sure. I guarantee that. The way his story is building up
Bendito sea tyson...gran k.o
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂😂🤣😂😂😂🤣😂
How is/was he a champion of anything? My son could throw a better punch.
BIG PUNCH TO Austin Theory TO FACE
The kids looking at him though. They are like 😳
Austin's music hits gives chills like edge's music hit
This was played excellently. Go Theory
Bro theory got straight up meteor crashed by a cosmic being lmaooo he hit him with thanos's gauntlet... straight up galactis punched him.. that was so funny
Dude he pulled that punch  AND opened his fist and it STILL looked painful 🤣🤣🤣
K.O punch from Tyson fury
Tyson Fury was like "hell no, I didn't come here to see you in championship match"..
Why didn't attack the cousin for interference too ??? Drew is the real champion
Theory takes it in the eary
I could watch this over n over
feel bad for theory...the man didnt even say or talk to fury lol
Theory is down Theory is down Theory is down
Wtf I'm losing all respect for fury right now Massive fan of him have his book. This is not right
More like concussion at the castle for theory
Pure class entertainment 👌 👏 Tyson Fury you legend. 👏
WHY DIDN'T THEORY GOT DIRECT INTO THE RING? IT IS ALL SCRIPTED.
Theory Got Punched An What if Solo Sikoa Got Kidnapped By Dexter Lumis
Triple h knowa what is best for business
Love how vince had high hopes for him and now triple h making a fool out of him
And what will you tell to Mr. MITB ?  Tyson Fury : Not today 😁
ᕦ( ⊡ 益 ⊡ )ᕤ
FAKEEE!!!
Legends say's tyson was hiding therè till this timè ...😪
That Gipsy king shirt tyson has on is fckn lit 🔥
What a awesome punch
I did not expect this
It was the close  races between the referee and theory 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm just glad Austin got his full name back I think its clear to see that they're saving his MITB cash in for a very huge special occasion
Now THEORY will never Wrestle again 🤣
I found books I was at Summerslam 2022
thought it was real for a sec but that was deffo fake Tyson's hand went behind his head an looked like he punched him
He shouldn’t have the brief case after two failed cash ins
Great sell by theory 👍
Ok
Well done gypsy king
There’s only one Tyson fury !!!!
Theory mistake is that he keeps going to the outside of the ring to cash in do it in the ring
That punch 🥊 go Tyson
The one time I actually kind of like wrestling
This was a amazing reaction from tyson Fury
Bro that pop was actually crazy. I really didn't expect people to be as hyped as I was, but they were. This is the best crowd since old NXT Takeovers and mania 30
Tyson punched Theory so hard you could hear is jaw pop out of place
That moment made me slap my uncle's head out of joy😅😅..
Seems like poor Theory will never cash it until 2023 lol
LOL that was great
Austin Theory Selling Is So Good
Tyson closes his eyes it's weird 😅😅😅
Thankyou Tyson Fury.
Theory 🤣🤣🤜💥💼
Highlight of the night 🇬🇧
At this rate i think Theory's money will always be in the bank.
Corey Graves wth did he do that for?? Lol
Will he ever cash in?
I wonder if they're gonna do it like dolph..
Клоун циганський
Yo what
Theory finally wakes up when RAW comes on 🤣
Lol I have to say that Theory is really good at selling
They should give him a fine for doing that
Theory is going too be the most unlike cash in as money in the bank lol  I kinda feel bad for him
Bruh this was brutal
Fury did what we all want to do lol
0:26 Theory felt what wilder had last year
Fury always throwing behind the ear punches.. man can’t help himself
God bless Tyson Fury 😍😍
Theory: hurry up and cash it in!!!!🏃🏻‍♂️🏃🏻‍♂️🏃🏻‍♂️ Tyson: hey, not tonight!! *punches theory*😡✊🏼👊🏻😵‍💫 Also Tyson: stay tf down!!! 😈😈😈😂😂😂😂😂
Austin theory has so much potential...
I'm glad leory got knocked out,I can't stand that cocky waste of talent,he reminds u alot of a aj styles when he 1st came into wrestling or a old Bobby lashley b4 he finally bacame a good guy,now he's a good champion . Once he becomes a good guy,he will b a great champion,until than just keep being the sry cocky wrestler u r.
no cashing bro 🤣🤣🤣
Which legends?
That was a really good sell
Ummm throw that man in jail. That’s assault brotha!
My god, Tyson Fury so extra HAHA
white screen right there
Fury frustrated with usyk and Joshua so took his frustration out on this poor guy ! ❤️
Austin theory is a good seller .....🤣
The more I watch that video the more I see Tyson Fury connect with that punch. Should have hit him much harder though lol
That pop for Theory was the most surprising thing of the night tbh.
Génial
the fury theory
this is gonna be Tyson vs Reigns
ko hahaha so take it's not even funny
That's assault......
Sure that was entertaining but he should of waiting until it was successful cashed in so that Theory would of wasted his shot
The fact that fury ain't even hit him but the camera angle looked like it did
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA LOL 😆 😂 🤣 😅
I love the man , the great Fury
That was awesome
Triple H, said not today my boy 😂😂
Fast and furious might as well quit WWE triple h has no plans for this kid
Roman always help him that's why he retain the champion and that not good
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Way too many POPS in CATC!!!
I wanted a triple threat match, tyson douchebag fury u will pay
Lol at what he’s doing with his arms 😂😂😂 a wwe exclusive
I liked that moment 😀😀
when happen theory win by money in bank its time
You couldn't have picked a worse thumbnail for this video if you tried.
How fake do you want it?
I hope they didn’t forget Theory on the flight back 😂😅
Good sort
You could hear his teeth clenched 😬😬😬🤧
Said it before, I'll say it again. Theory is the weakest looking MITB winner I've ever seen. I know he gone win it at one point but dang it just gets worse every week
Damn he should’ve let him cashed it in  then punched him
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I actually heard the punch lol he must’ve hit him on the shoulder for real
Excellent
Tyson fury punch Austin theory out cold
Keep trying buddy ,you 'll get there eventually
He gave theory and theory of his own!! 😂😂😂
Tyson deserves to get his name out around the world! He's one of the best British boxers! Yes WWE is stuntmen but I fully support in them bringing tyson to it. 😊 Please WWE help tyson with his campaign on sorting out knife crime!!
I couldn’t stop laughing at that part 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 served Theory right 🤣🤣🤣 can’t wait to hear Theory’s excuse next time I just wish Tyson Fury could knock out that suck up Corey Graves
Tyson Theo’ry
One shot one kill 😆 sad for Theory
I was hoping better than this comedy after Old man gone
I Bet many times for nothing 💔💔
"A-Town Down"
No need for it,he hit him from nowhere,hope the fella makes a full recovery,fury you big bully,the guy was half his size aswel,
"Tyson and Austin,  Tyson and Austin,  Tyson and Austin!"
Gotta give theory this, he’s got a very recognisable theme. I legit went crazy when I heard ‘A-Town…DOWN.’  He’s great in the ring and on the mic to just needs doesn’t have ‘the look’ of a champion rn, if you know what I mean.
legends say theory still hasn’t woke up and got left in the UK.
I want to do that every time I see him
The Cringy King
This was so hilarious, I burst out laughing! Austin theory really can do comedy well, but I really hope he gets a serious push, he has the charisma / heat!

😂😂😂
Ooo myyyy GOD!!   🤪🤪🤪🤪😂😂😂🤗🏃🏃🏃🏃🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪🇰🇪
I mean Fury had to save the show.
Totally scripted sh*ts
So they’re calling him Austin again ?
I hope they’re not doing another Otis type storyline with Theory.
I do hope Austin Theory never gets to be WWE Universal Champion. That would suck to watch.
Buen fresco, gane como los campeones así le dijo Tyson furi jajajajajaja
The crowd 🔥
I didn't like it. I'm actually rooting for Theory.
Cuando vino el primo de Román porque no reaccionó de la misma manera ?
So funny 😂
That was really stupid Tyson protecting Roman from losing his championship belt
Very interesting film
Can we talk about the mad pop theory got though
Lol. I love how even the preview picture shows the punch missing him completely 😂
I just noticed the title says Austin Theory AUSTIN theory. I hope this isn't a typo and they gave this man his name back
If this is a sign of things to come HHH and Stephanie need to be gone.
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
WWE still pissing on the current roster for celebrities and attitude era guys
This is so hype 🙌 😍 👏
Well done  bud xx
Best moment !
This match was absolute madness I loved it
theory shouldve cashed in and won
staged.
Thank you Tyson Fury!
He tried Poor guy
That was actually really good acting lol
Lo habra noquedo de verdad? porque hasta sono el golpe 😂
Tyson fury need to become a wwe superstar I’m down for it
Theory must jus 4get about cashing inn
Guys on the fly back probably laughing at Theory....Hunter probably ask the street profits to check on Theory....one of comes back saying hey dawg he still knocked out. He got the smoke 🤣
Theory may be the Youngest MITB holder in History but He will be the First in History to Hold it until it expires next Year 😅😅😅
0:35 I feel like this look from Tyson here is him geniuniely concerned if he's knocked out haha
Que??!!!!😦😧😮😯😲😅😄😆👏 Impactante y hilarante
punching bag theory😄😁
So fake it’s funny 😂
Oh so he's Austin Theory again now?😁
Looked funny running all the way to that position 😆
Gold wwe I see you HHH
Excellent Falcon 👊 that was extremely hilarious 🤣🤣🤣 great way to end it Tyson 👏
Wilder is crying at home
😂😂😂😂😂
IS that Wrestler OK !!!!! I hope he's not too badly hurt !!!!! I think he should press charges ... Tyson why did you do that ...
This legit had me pissing myself laughing. 😂
Fantastic moment, really ramped up the excitement at the finish, shame drew didn’t win
could have picked a better capture for this video as this shows that Fury punched behind him :D
I laughed so hard when Fury knocked him🤣🤣🤣
Good shot Tyson. And Theory sold it well with the stiff crossed arms on the floor like a legit knock out
Ok… right now Austin Theroy is the victim of Triple H 😅😆
only 1 GYPSY KING!
I went to watch that yesterday
The best part is Theory freezes like a mummy after taking that punch 😹
OOOH ITS ON😆
is it me or do the crowds outside the US seem much more turned up and full of it?? love the crowd energy makes me feel like im there they were ruckus the whole night now thats a fun environment the UK crowds always bring it
Ron Simmons: Damn!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dreams sweet Dreams! fell like a potato croquette!
you could hear the "punch" over the crowd, he smacked him hard 🤣🤣
Dude got knocked down n u guys in the comments saying he sold it?w$f  is wrong with u people
Ever since Triple H took over Theory has been burried on every show 🤦 what a good creative he is lol
looks set up but what a KO by the gypsy king
If you like overselling this mr mitb is the man lmao
🏰🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
0:25 even the big show would have been impress with that ko punch 😂
Slowed down the playback and Tyson missed him.. He'd probs be dead if he hadn't tbh
All these grown men and women looking at WWE and it for children, pathetic
The bad luck continues for Theory.
That pop for theory thou. British fans are the best
Theory got Deboed 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Legends say someone at commentator screaming "IT'S TYSON AND AUSTIN!"
That scene was brilliant
In theory that's was a perfect moment to cash in😅
Not tonight mate.
Triple h always doing the opposite mr mcmahon doing to him
It's theory trying to cash in wait a minute he got KO 😂😂😂
What a punch
people saying how he sold the punch...... hes a vegetable now xd
That was real 😂😂😂
Triple H u r de best🔥♥️
I will never understand how you people can get so excited about these bogus programs ...
Lol
Tyson is the legend
This boxer was right when he hit him he would have spoiled the match even though it was a sad match when Drew lost
I think Theory should take the beef in the boxing ring with Fury and cash in his MITB contact...😂😂
Surprised tyson agreed to the cheap shot tbh not a good look I understand it’s fake but still
Is it just me or WWE is getting better after almost a decade
Theory is still theory...not yet reality 😅
I do care what anyone says I straight popped as soon as I heard "A-Town Down!!!"
Just heading into Cardiff now to see if Theory is still flat out on his back in the middle of The Principality Stadium.
Dang he might of knocked himself out with that bump on the floor.
How do people like this fake sport
😱
Should have let him cash in
When theory meets facts
Why did Tyson fury do that ??
Hard to fake a real punch but it’s was fake none the less
🤣
Now I want to see Austin cash-in in every ppv and knock out by different cameo from boxer, mma, footballer or even cameraman.
Fury just cleared him out up the gypseyking
fury should have been arrested for that.
Thats how to acknowledge tribal chief 😎
Theory doing his best rendition of Rodney:  NO RESPECT AT ALL. GOT THE LONGEST BEDREST AT HOME AND SLEPT FOR 12 HOURS STRAIGHT. TYSON FURY KNOCKED ME DOWN.
Austin Theory vs Tyson Fury for the MITB contract when?
I like how every time Theory tries to cash in he gets thwarted, then he just lays there 🤣😂🤣
THE GYPSHY KING BAYBAY
Imagine if he ran over to exactly where Fury was sitting 😩
Never really liked theory but his selling is gold tier
Theory: I'm gonna cash in  Tyson punched theory  Tyson: Nope. Not today kid.
Theory falling and he can't get up
You dosser
Boring wwe.. always let roman wins.
Such a sweet moment. 😍
Imagine if Tyson Fury botched and actually knocked out Austin Theory
Theory has to cash in successfully in the near future. Guy has given us golden moments, he deserves a win 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
it's getting old, him trying to make every PPV championship match into a triple-threat, it's not surprising anymore
10/10 for the fencing response.
This was great creative direction, so much back and forth and unexpected twists.
Fury a ținut cu Roman. M-am săturat să fie tot timpul căței alături de Roman 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂🤔🤔🤔🤔🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭 funny
Hi there Tyson
They could have made it that Tyson stoped interfered in the match resulting in a drew win, just make Roman lose already it is getting a bit ridiculous now and boring imo
I am slowly growing old.. I just want to complain about this😂
If I was theory I will just sell the MITB contract, because his cash in are not successful and it will never be successful
Has he even woken up yet or is he still on the ground knocked out
Theory be like: oh come on not again
thats amazing!
Why did tyson do that to little austin so sad
Poor thery first brock and now tyson
Ahahah for a moment Fury got concerned to have really sent him to another dimension after Theory sold it so well
Thank you Dyson
Hey Theory. Not tonight not any night. Oops
It's the funniest entry I've seen in my entire life by the idiot from Theory surpassed Titus O'Neil's
That was the best sell of the year
Austin Theory gets an F-5 from Lesnar & now a right hand from Tyson Fury. That serves him out in the picture.
Tyson: I'm enjoying the fight sit down 🤣🤣
Nice one fury! Next time punch him till he cant move anymore!
This does put a smile on my face. 😂
*Another good moment for Theory even though he is the one being dropped.*
Gysy king at wwe
A town just got tko by tyson fury
Austin 😁😁😁
Wait for it Theory Vs Theory Wrestlemania
Lol that punch
I love seeing Theory getting knocked out whenever he tries cashing in first Lesnar stopped him and this time is Tyson 😂 would be nice to see Theory getting knocked out whenever he tries to cashing in
Brock Lesnar couldn't obtain the championship from Roman more than once , even Drew failed to get the championship , there must be a new one to take it ..👍💞
IN DA FACE!
He runs all the way down with the ref around the ring in front of Tyson
I can see a match between them two
shame JR wasnt there,,,imagine 'bah gawd, Tyson and Austin,,,,Tyson and Austin!!
That is a Furious d**k move punch right there. lol
Cometary: why did he do that for  Fury : because you can when your the king of the world .
The theory is his brain will never be the same
Get up craig come on Craig 😂😂😂
Everything planned wwe💩
Triple h is genius
ATOWN is the new Miz theme for money in the bank cash in. gives the same pop lol
That was STIFF
That Theory is such a troll! Made me laugh out loud when he burst out of nowhere. I honestly didn't expect him to try and cash in.
Nah Theory was stuck fr lol
why he need wait to he cash it in and did it
A Town went down
Fury with the ko punch
Looks loks he properly hit him
You see Austin Theory you failed for the second time the cash in your money in the bank contract Plus I'm just saying if you were to cash in successfully you would have lost anyways to either Roman Reigns or Drew McIntyre will there be a third time the cash in that money in the bank contract but Choose Wisely on this time because at the pay-per-view earlier man you got knocked out by Tyson Fury I'm sorry buddy it was funny as heck
Theory got his name back "Austin Theory"
Theory next championship
Fury knocked a Theory out of him
😱
Best part of the show
Who thought theory would try to cash in? -Almost everyone Who thought Tyson Fury's goin to knock him out? -No one Who loved what happened -Everyone lol  The crowd went crazy. This crowd are full of energy from start to finish
The story is not clear why will Theory hand over the briefcase there normally they do that in the ring
Por qué le pegó? Y luego estaba desprevenido, Tyson Fury es un cobarde.
All this Roman vs Rock talk, don't think they should but let's say they were to do that match with the titles & Austin cashed in on both of them, biggest disappointment ever!
So real!!
Guess Tyson fury didn’t want theory to cash in
😮
that's the most sense that been knocked into theory.
Theory felt the Fury. 😂
Maybe. Tyson is enough of Theory that is why he punch him in the face.
Lol
AT down! 😁💥🥊
Top 3 moments of the night 🤣👌 my boy Austin Theory with the cash in! Not!!!
Austin wants to get kicked himself as per the script.
Hahahaha..
Wished Fury would’ve knocked out Solo and we would’ve seen what the real outcome would happened…
The highlight of the match was seeing theory get folded by fury
FURY KNOCKS THEORY HAHAHA 😂😂😂
Replay button 0:25
Tyson Fury with the right jab👊💥down💫💤goes Austin Theory🙌☝
The POP when Theory got KTFO by Fury was Insane!!...lol
I always knew that Roman can no longer win a fight without someone helping him. Team Drew I remain...
Theory is the BEST SELLER in ALL of wrestling already... this and the Stunner he took from Stone Cold PROVES it!!
That looked real.
Good sell by Austin.
Rumour has it theory needs new clothes he’s still out and his clothes are out of fashion
Austin  theory is a little punk with a big mouth I'm glad Tyson fury poped him  that was a hell of a shot
I feel like they’re building this so that when he does he will actually win
hahaha THEORY..disrespected again...
The return your name 'Austin theory'
“You got knocked the f*** out!”
I ask, why?
First, the Stunner sell at WrestleMania 38. Then, the superkick sell on RAW with Dolph Ziggler. Now, the KO punch sell. Gotta say, Theory is the face of marketing in WWE because he's the TOP SELLER!!! 😂😂😂
I think all of us In the comments will agree that theory Is going to lose his contract just like what happen to otis when he lost his against the miz.
Theory might try it again at survivor series
Bro thought he was gonna do the Seth Rollins cash-in moment
Strike 2 theory
Did that contact ?
Theory: I'M CASHING IN Tyson Fury: hi, how you doin
Erm that’s assault mate
Very strong 💪 punch 👊
The pop austin got was great though, let’s b honest
Why Tyson I wish Roman lose The title😭😭😭😭
I never get why WWE always lets outsiders make their stars look bad
why they did my guy like that lmaaaoooo
The crowd was amazing they make the spots stand out when it's a great crowd
also good to see Theory back to his real name Austin Theory like Matt Riddle did
That was funny 🤣🤣🤦‍♀️ you not cashing in sh$t. Theory got knocked the F out. That's what he get.
So did he win the belt ?
00:25 that was satisfying. 😂
God bless Tyson Fury fr
In “Theory”, Austin’s still on the floor😂😂😂
Theory has 1 defense when he tries to cash in
I may be a minority here, but I'm so sick of the Roman/ bloodline championship storyline...
Well that was just rude and uncalled for   Why he do that for?
His name his Austin theory again?!?! I thought it was just theory lmfao
The reaction theory got was awesome, I didn’t even think he was gonna try cash in
He deserved it
Makes Fury look like a real scumbag thug here, suckerpunching someone
Fury fury fury  class act
And if anyone else did that they would of been thrown in jail!
England still one of the top crowds
he should be in jail! that's assault!
Theory is  really taking it for this company. He definitely going places
Best moment of the entire PPV
I feel bad for theory 😂😂😭😭😭
So Tyson stops Theory from cashing in but doesn't stop Roman from cheating and then shakes his hand? He backwards lol. Although he did shake up with Drew as well i'll give him that.
My FAVORITE moment. Thank you Tyson!!
Wouldn't it be funny that Austin Theory is the only guy to never cash in the contract?
I witnessed that. Fury is Awesome indeed.  Awesome match which either could win, without any interference. Don't understand what the heck Bloodline still involving yet again ?
So Austin Theory wins MITB, giving him the right to cash in for a world title match. He attempts to insert himself into the match to cash in and gets decked by Tyson Fury. Roman proceeds to bring in outside help to insert themselves into the match and help him win. So Fury then proceeds to get in the ring and shake Romans hand. 😵😵😵 what???
WWE
Fury vs Theory a dream match in the making
until he retires he never gonna cash it in
Thank y was he allowed to do that but who cares thank y no one wants theory
That's my Gypsy king
Bro sometimes i just don't understand! It doesn't make any sense for him for each time to try to cash in only to get knocked out by someone! They're making austin look like a punk!
Austin Theory's theme sells by itself
And still money in the bank winner theory
When did theory get his first name back?
Theory should of cash in. Fury is a L for that
All hail Gypsy King.
He got his name back 👍🏽👍🏽
Wait was he actually knocked out 🤣 he body went stiffer than my grandad on viagra
He can just go inside the ring but went to barricade instead lol
Thank God theory’s got his first name back, Austin Theory. WWE champ soon.
Really hope this is the running gag every ppv
When I heard about Austin Theory being at CotC 🏰 I immediately said watch he’s gonna cash in tonight because why else would they have him come all the way over seas if they weren’t planning to have him at least try
Imagine if they had Leon jump over the barricade and hit him with head since he was sitting right there too🤣
Tyson is the hero we needed🙏🏽
I'm happy that he didn't lose the contract ...
That lil swerve was too good 😂 I was ready for him to win it 😂
Probably one of the very very few times any Welsh person cheered for an English one 😂
Not that he sent him into rigor mortis ☹️🤦🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️😂
Fury be like : I payed to see reigns vs drew not some skinny cena whannabe
That has to be one of the best punch sells i've seen
Beautiful ✌️
I hope theory failing to cash in becomes a running joke in the wwe
I really like this moment 😂😂
when I saw this I died it was way to funny
Tbh mitb becoming a joke
A VERY GOOD MOMENT HAHAHA
Austin Theory just got KO'd by tha Undefeated Heavyweight Champ Tyson Fury that guy ain't go ever catch a Big Break...
Ha Ha Theory lost his cash in
It was to promote the fight against Usyk, but hey Theory did deserve it 🤷🏼
At WWE Clash At The Castle, Austin Theory felt the wreath of Tyson’s “FURY!” (See what I did there!)
Boring
Would be funny if Theory never got to cash in ever until next money in the bank pay per viewer.  (I think the briefcase becomes invalid after one year) so would be perfect if he was scripted to never win it until the annual day of money in the bank ladder match, and  he gets to cash in finally and win the titles barely, and the new money in the bank winner from earlier that night comes out and then beats him for the title. Would be awesome to see.
As He sHould.
Heard that thud
Best moment of the night
The Rock Pain and Gain: JESUS HAS BLESSED ME WITH MANY GIFTS. AND ONE OF THOSE GIFTS IS KNOCKING SOMEONE THE FREAK OUT!
Lmfao
😭🤣🤣
El mejor momento de la historia 0:25 😂😂😂
WWE are sick geniuses for putting fans through this pain month after month its crazy every Roman title defence you think could now be the day and it never is 😫😫😫
Wat should done just got in the ring and the ref cash it for he made big mistake there 🤣🤣
No jode más ese
Hahahahahha
Tbh, getting punched at the back of the head is dangerous
It would be funny if Theory wins the next Money in the bank and then cashes in for both titles.
Theory is a champ for that one.
Like bro
Big Show would’ve been proud of Tyson Fury
It’s still Real to me
Pokemon trainer: "Tyson fury .....use Dynamite punch!!"...🤣👍
Kinda reminds me of when Undertaker randomly punched Scotty 2 Hotty during his Royal Rumble 2002 entrance dance lol
tyson fury Vs roman reigns in 2023😂
Poor theory can’t even get in a successful cash in 🤣
So, they’re just going to let fans in the audience attack the superstars? Where was security at? 🙏
Poor kids just Tryna make it 😂
Thousands of thanks Tyson for preventing a tragedy
I have an Idea and I'd be very excited if this happens   Imagine  Theory attempts cashes in every ppv and gets knocked out   Then at wrestlemania he succeeds and shocks everyone
I lost all respect for the furrys bc of his son
The Roman drew match was insane wwe did an excellent job making the crowd think drew was guna win absolutely crazy show it’s mental watching the show I’m the stadium without the commentators amazing show
I love how Theory is universally hated enough to block him every time he goes for it lol
Tyson fury just knocked the hell out of Theory   Michael Cole spitting bars
I was there live this moment absolutely blew the roof off the principality stadium it was great
Thx tyson
Theory went " AWW SHIIIIIII here we go again "while taking that punch
Tyson saved Roman😂
smokey:you got knocked the eff out.😂
Pra que caralho serve esse mitb se o cara falha sempre porra assistir esses combates do roman já sabendo que vai ganhar aí e foda kkkkkk
Night night theory night night wrong place wrong time
Jajajaja poor stupid Teorí...he never can cash this... Next time, more punch from anyone who not let be this jerk never champion, please... Congratulations Tyson, well done
La niña tiory
Thank you Tyson.
Theory sold that good. Went stiff 🤣
That's what theory gets for trying to cash in the money in the bank
great moment xD
A baja potencia pero se la puso de verdad encima en ese lugar es re peligroso. Están locos 😂😂😂
Poor Austin just trying to cash in 😂
So real!! Look like concussion! Great job!!
His body just hit the canvas with grace
Imagine if Fury broke his hand punching that guy in the head...
Poor theory always getting dropped whenever he attempts to cash in
The oughtta arrest Fury for that! That’s assault!
Time to stop watching wwe network the trash line family got Old long time ago....Aew .all the way....
😆 this was awesome! But, would have been better if he waited until the cash in was official..
Great this a$$ clown is back in the WWE 😴
Damn did he hit him fr?
Failed again
Dang. All Theory wants is a cash in😂😂
Looked like that hurt like a mug lmao
Lo que está haciendo Theory con tal de consolidarse es sorprendente, ojalá le llegue su momento de canjear de manera correcta
Sooooo...Theory has his first name back, too?
Sue tyson fury
Roman had EVERYONE on his side
Why? 🤣
Well he's dead.
A-TOWN FAILED
god damnnn 😂😂mane why they do theory like that
Lol it was cool and big pop and all but why .
thats how you put A-town down lmfao
imagine being called austin theory. they change it to just theory, and fans get mad  they change it bac and booom!!!  the fans call him theory  conclusion.. you cant win em all lol
I was so annoyed by this I wanted to see a legit cash in and a title change
🤣🤣 it was so unexpected to me that it made it so funny in my opinion 🤣
I can hear Smokey from the movie Friday, 'damn.....you got knocked the f*** out!' 😆😆😆
He's only the greatest boxer of all time.
Theory ain’t got nothing on Fury! 🇵🇭🔥
Theory is a joke. With someone like Karron Kross around from NXT who Theory never beat. Why put the belt on him. Not happening its going to be a failure.
I watched this like 4 or 5 times 😂😂 it's Fury not Theory 🤣🤣
Tyson's fake punch is equivalent to an average humans serious punch 😂
😂 that's probably the hardest fake punch theory has ever received
Sheesh
LOL
Rude
🤣🤣🤣. They did Theory and Vince dirty
Tyson Fury decking Austin Theory is the closest we’re going to get to a real life Rocky Balboa VS Thunder Lips.
Really want him to win his cash in when it happens
Fkn ouch
I like the Duke thrower!!
- Summer Slam attempt ❌ - Clash in the Castle attempt ❌  Theory next Attempt : - Extreme Rules - Crown Jewel - Survivor Series
This had me dying😂.
Theory has received the boxing theory called "The Fist Of Fury"
Remember when it was Tyson Fury and Braun Strowman who went toe to toe
Fury straight stole him!!!
0:25 it was at this moment that he knew, he f'd up.
Fury punches legends of………..  Theory. 😆😆😆😆
THANK YOU FURY!
Dreadful stuff
The way Theory sold it was so perfect lmao, gotta admit it was a really cool and hilarious moment 💕
Wow that is messed up actually. This pose to been the moment he had to take the belt off roman and they ruin it with that
Every time Theory tries to cash in, someone stops him. This should be a storyline.
Cant stop laughing at this 🤣🤣🤣
Seeing Tyson Fury knocking out Theory made my day
at this point hes going to cash in on the money in the bank ladder match
That is stupid risk to get a knuckle out of a heavyweight boxer non gloves with ring it aint solding the punch he truly is in disarray with that
Rithg zizi really
Thank you fury
That was the best part
Legend has it Theory is still down and out 😂
Is Austin Theory still laying there after the show goes off?
What a Punch
ALL OUT is going to be epic 🔥🔥🔥
Pobre theory😂🤣😂🤣😂
I think this failed cash-in is now becoming a comic relief and I'm enjoying it. Hope we get more failed cash-ins in succeeding PPV events hahahaha.
Omg that punch was brutal
오스틴 시어리가 캐싱인 했으면 드류가 언더스퓨티드 챔피언으로 등극 했을건데
So is Tyson going to be arrested for assault??
Lol
Out cold..nite theory😂😂😂😂
Sir that is assault
The only surprise of the main event 🥱🥱
“A-Town..” 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
*Austin Theory's Theme:* 🎶 A-Town Down. 🎶  *Tyson Fury:* "🤣 Austin is definitely on the ground."
THANK YOU TYSON!!
Theory is getting the seth rollins treatment with the briefcase
Funny how he had to run all the way right there before making his decision
That was funny as hell !!!
Where is your daddy ?
his theme song slaps now ngl
What Fury doing he brought  a ticket  to watch
0:25 If you just want to watch Tyson Fury KO Austin Theory.
The kids were shocked. They couldn't beleive what Fury had just done.
Vince McMahon is definitely still in charge lol
Como siempre roman siempre es defendido por alguien ya wwe no sirve is fake
That was hilarious , 2 times in a row he gets knocked down , 1st with Brock , now Tyson Fury lolll love this , continue on this way Theory , one day it'll be your day but until then , let's us laugh some more !! :D
Hey Theory got his name back!
This is the second time theory has failed 😣,  WWE PLEASE continue these failed cash ins, this makes my day every time it happens!!
I hope he got kicked out and arrested for that.
Pat: "Why the hell you do that for?" Like protecting his homie & shii lol
When roman lose,, roman suck
0:25 God, that was just over🤣🤣🤣
2 Competitors + Cashing in A Briefcase to Win 2 Titles at the Announcers Table with A Famous Boxer sitting in the Audience Right Beside the Announcers Table =‘s What
Dam man tyson is a world class entertainer
Thank you Tyson Fury for one punching that guy who don't know when to shut up
Dude really has a great entrance theme, works well for surprises and stuff. One of those great themes where you know who it is a second in
He actually KO'd him. Watch Seconds Out interview that was just released
Good for him 💯.
I said theory not even a second later a town down I went mental
But Reigns still won
La WWE es puro libreto si hubiese sido un aficionado de inmediato entra la seguridad y lo capturan pero como es un famoso no pasa nada sea o no sea famoso en estos momentos es un aficionado
Him actually winning the undisputed championship? That's just a theory
Theary got clocked
Austin greenhorn gIVE UP
The best moment of this PPV.🤣
The show sucked! No wonder they haven't done a large show in 30 years!
The only good part.
Please cash in unsuccessfully at every PPV until next year's MITB doing a "running out of time" storyline!
Damm another failure for theory at least we’ll get a feud with Tyson Fury l don’t feel bad that he was knocked out by him but I know theory will cash in Sooner or later weather people like him or not 😅😅✌️✌️
When will theory money in the bank expire?
Tyson Fury should be fine 1,000,000$$
Tyson Fury really said: I’m bout to end this man’s whole career
Wow I think he falls really bad and he is not pretending
Theory is always getting bullied by everyone😂
W Tyson 😂
Thank you Tyson fury
Make that a match between theory vs fury
The best thing about the event, hahahaha, was what. I liked it more and liv morgan's fight
This is my favorite moment of all!  All matches are so predictable. Especially the main event.  Hope to see Roman lose, Fake champion.  So many help in all his matches  Can't win fair.   Kudos to HHH Nice show!!!
Turned him into Practice after that punch
That looks like a concussion
U got knocked da hell out haha Hahaha
😂 Yes. That breifcase its all over mess it up to 2023
The best sell of a punch ever
Fury vs Theory?
🤣🤣🤣 To Austin Theory: 😢
Stellar PPV! start to finish. despite the singing at the end(think that was suppose to be a dark segment but the camera was still rolling), it was a good night.
That was superb 😉
good acting on theorys part but Tyson didn't even connect
Tyson Fury with the Night night Punch to Austin Theory
Theory went to sleep 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fight not gentleman.. good cheat fight, still have back-up from cousin younger brother bloodline ? Why 😭..!  fight 1by1 be a gentleman..not get some help from them.
A-Town DOWN 🤣🤣🤣
He fail see ya 🤣😅🤣
damit Tyson Fury should be ban on WWE!! THEORY SUPPOSE TO BE THE NEW CHAMP! AND THAT BOOOOOOOOOOOOORING STUPID ROMAN REIGNS ERA IS OVER!!!!  DAMIT! FURY STAY AWAY FROM WWE! YOU SUCK
En la tercera se le va a dar jajaja
This is Fury's stuff wwe he likes to pretend & act to fight like he says for Usyk and AJ .....
This was hilarious austin theory can't catch a break with cashing in.
He won't be awake until the Wales play in their next Six Nations game
F that guy. Theory is the future. Has all the tools. Will be champion shortly.
Legend says fury hits so hard he couldn't ko old Klitschko and wallin
I thought at first it was RKOs. That would've been awesome 😄
yah big dosser
cardiff has a great reaction they are better than the american fans they are just tinkering with the phone for the video
yes somebody just knock em dead already
Bro look how hype the crowd was I hope he actually cashes in and wins and we don’t have to deal with this every ppv
Bro finished him with one knockout blow lol 😂😂
Tyson Fury vs Austin Theory. Book it Triple H.
This legit has me dying while I was watching it.
Remember when Austin Theory first started nobody would pop when hearing the theme song   Look at how far he’s come
That punch most definitely connected lmao
Thank you Tyson Fury
The crowd made the event amazing but after the ppv, I still felt a void. Like I wanted more. Just didn’t satisfy me like I though it would, and I was very giddy and anxious for this ppv for some reason
Bro said nap time
AUSTIN Theory is back! 💪🏼
The way Theory sold that punch and acted like he went stiff was golden 😂😂
A town down 😂
I prefer Gane knocking Tuivasa
Damn that straight punch was 🔥.
DAMN he got knocked tf out!!!
Man if that punch didn't actually knock him out that was THE BEST most realistic selling I've ever seen in 35 years of watching wrestling.
That was so freaking funny 😄 😭
Never get sick of seeing that nonce get knocked out
I laughed hard when Tyson knocked out Theory 😂😂😂
Theory Just got an A Town Punch by Tyson Fury serves theory right him right perhaps at Crown Jewel we could see him vs Fury one on one just like theory fought Pat at mania this year I would to see Fury in the WWE ring again even though I never saw him wrestle cause I just started gotten into the wrestling universe back in 2019 but I learned so much watch all the old guys and every in a matter of months plus I would love to see Pat wrestle again at Crown Jewel maybe a rematch between him and Happy Corbin and this time a No DQ match
Me in my Mike Epps voice: Someone please call 911!
That punch to Theory was great. Tyson really taught him a lesson right there. I'm also happy that HHH brought Theory full name back to Austin Theory. First, Riddle and now Theory's full name is back.
Sorry theory looks like you got KOed by the Gypsy King
That is the greatest thing I’ve ever seen
Legends say austin theory laying down there and cant get back up even a after a minute.
I hope Theory will cash in the Money in the Bank 💰 🏦 contract again for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship match at Extreme Rules 🌙❌ next month.
😂😂 I LOVE IT 😂😂
Disappointing card. No upsets or title changes. Just a high profile house show.
This was a outstanding ppv  thankyou Triple H  also the press confront thjs remind me of  Boxing and UFC  welldone a awesome show. Thory got knock  by a tractor.
Boy went night night
His money in the bank contract is gonna end with him attempting to hijack the titles😭😂 Bet he's not gonna want a selfish then.😂🤣
Román rey no es ningún jefes ribar así sies bueno ganar con trampa
You think that Theory would have known better than to stop right in front of Fury. Those things always seem to happen.
🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂👍
Tyson Fury is a legend
Austin Theory is really great at selling.
So funny  best moment of wwe Clash of the castle Fury knock out Theory   Usos younger brother i think sami is being use  and the real member of the bloodline  is solo Sikoa.
Yes Austin Theory just got KO
The way he sold that, was amazing!  his body seized up like how some knockouts in MmA or boxing
That was perfect timing
Oh no , Tyson again 💩
👀👀👀  Kinda look like YAMCHA laying there all glassy eyed 🤣🤣🤣
Damn it sounded like he connected big time
Theory still has his arms crossed right now
The Chad Theory failing to cash in and being knocked out in the process twice lmao
Have they got no security at these things... That's outrageous.
Tyson didn’t want the match ruined 😂😂🤣
Hate to say it but theory just won me over by selling that way. What my old kickboxing coach called "the stiff chipmunk." 😂
Dammm
😂😂😂
Phew his name is Austin Theory again
Imagine if this keeps happening on every PPV.  Commentator: Here comes Austin Theory coming to cash in... and he just got knocked out before he could.
Best moment of the night! I don't think Theory will ever be able to cash in! Lol
He got knocked the fkk out 😂
Bro I was in tear watching this
A Town Ouch
Failed 2 time in row Austin
Well that's one way of stopping a cash in. KTFO the guy doing it :D
Deontae theory 😂
Thats a good punch. Does that considered he has cash in?
I thought honestly it would be like Seth Rollins heist at WM 31😅
Good to see ppl are getting back their first names
Theory vs Fury? That's something Vince would go for because damnit they rhyme so make it a storyline!  But he's not the CEO anymore.
Even better thx
Yes thank u Tyson tury
roman always cheats his way to wining
😂🤦‍♂️
Damn that punch sure looked real 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Awesome ...
Well done Tyson hate theory
Lol
You people should live Roma is like Messi and Rolando
Damn, that was so funny and awesome
• 👏🏻 • 👏🏻 • 👏🏻 •
Boxing and wwe don’t mix it never did shii looked gay asf 😂😂
Fury did what all of us want to do 😂😂
A-town down 🤣🤣🤣
So funny 😂😂😂😂
Theory 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Damn that was a legit punch. Austin Theory be taking some hard bumps. Roman and Brock both beat the hell out of him at SummerSlam too 😂
👎👎👎👎
Theory got whacked so hard he's still trying to find his way........
Bravoo..👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏 👏
One more failed cash in by austin theory
Haha
This PPV was way better than wrestlemania
Tyson like “Hell naw son! Not today you ain’t!” 🤣🤣💀💀
That was a slobber knocker lol
My man theory will never cash-in in a PPV 😆😆
Ironic how he ran up out of all places  within an arms reach of Fury.  So dumb
XD
I forgot Tyson was there, and really thought that a fan attacked and knocked out Theory...
So...are we gonna just ignore the fact that theory attempted a cash in at summerslam then wwe is like nah well give it back to you
Leon Edwards recording like a fan🤣
That was so satisfying to watch.. stupid Theory deserves that.
Legends say theory is still laying down there 😂😂
Probably one of the most expensive punches of the year
They should make this a thing, have Theory come out and try to cash in and somebody stop him every time untill they are ready to give him a chance lol
That’s two times theory failed to cash in the contract
snore.
Sorry Theory. Maybe another time.
Pa que ganara roman, mejor hayan dejado canjear al teorias
Theory got the Fury!!!
it’s worth noting he’s back to “austin theory” and not just “theory”
So now it's Austin theory
J.R: Tyson Tyson Tyson
I lost my voice from screaming when theory came out
I can't help but laugh, Will Theory ever Cash in?.. Tell me he's gonna cash in, without telling me he's gonna cash in.... That's was real Knock from Tyson Fury.
He's never gonna cash in lol everyone keeps stopping him
Ooooh my gawd Austin Theory went night night bruh his arm was up too that was a trip. 😂😂
If only he did the same to Solo or Roman.
heeeeeeeeeeeeell yeah
Wow!!!
They should’ve had wilder punch Theory
Used in the right spot
the kids in the back thinking a random guy punched him😂
Lmaooo I love theory’s sell it fits his character so well with it being halfway comical
Nice one tyson 😂
Legit thought he'd be stopped by gargano or someone.  It being fury was better.  I hope every time he tries to cash in something happens to him and the year expires. It'll be a first and funny to watch the different people and ways he gets screwed out of a cash in
Did any one from the uk win a match
The ref keeping up with theory the whole way down 🤣
First
Theory always has a plan. Until Tyson punched him in the face. 😅😅
That punch was not a work, I bet he's having misaligned jaw now.
Poor Theory (NOT REALLY) Lol!!!
Somebody go wake Theory up. 💤
Glad they gaved him back his first name
Honestly sickening to see (in my opinion) the best heavyweight boxer of all time doing WWE stuff when he has at least 3-4 years left of his prime.
Why wasn't he arrested?
Low key I straight up forgot about Theory and that he still hasn’t cashed in his contract.
Has anyone let Tyson Fury know that wrestling isn't real?
He sold that KO, he was looking stiff as a board lol.
Give theory his push enough everybody saving Roman. For a champion he needs a lot of help.
They way he sold that punch made it look like what actually happens when people get kod in fights. Austin Theory has so much potential
LETS GO FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGING HIM AS AUSTIN
In the moral words Stone Cold Steve Austin: "Oh Hell Yeah"
Tyson fury or you did to Austin was funny as f*** thank you
I honestly didn't see that coming.  Although it's hilarious how Tyson Fury knock Theory out outta nowhere.😃😆
😍😍😍☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻☝🏻🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That actually looked painful🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Theory doesn't get enough credit for selling. He sold the Stone Cold Stunner just as good as Rock did and he sold that right hook by Fury really well. 🤣
Loved it 👍
Tyson sent him to the Gulag 😂😂
Otro canjeó fallido
At this rate there should be a montage of Austin Theory's failed cash-ins.
Sending a message to Usyk. The Gypsy King is back! 🥊
Am I the only one that was actually upset by this? I figured if he cashed in it was a win no matter what. Theory wins = huge heat, Roman wins = drew rematch, drew wins = defies all odds
POW!  Right in the kisser.💢☺️ 0:25
Cringe
Tyson vs Austin for a new generation I guess
The Gypsy King strikes again!
Theory got knocked out of out where  by Tyson fury.😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Fury vs Theory
Cody makes a heroic return at the rumble and he wins to challenge Roman at WM, he wins then Theory comes out to spoil the party
They really made Austin Theory look like a loser
He sold that punch perfectly🤣 I’m very disappointed he didn’t get to cash in tho
Fury: perfectly balanced..as all things should be
Tyson Fury For The Win *
Fury hiding out in the wwe away from usyk
Gyspy Born Gyspy Breed.
That's so funny
Another mess up from Theory 😆😆😆
Im not gonna lie, i am now completely behind Theory ending Reigns run. BUT after a few more failed attempts.
Pretty sure the head smashing into the ground really knocked him out. Unless he faked the stiff arm thing.
This needs to be a thing for a while; every time Austin Theory tries cashing in, someone prevents it from happening. 😂
Tyson Fury didn't sign with WWE man Austin Theory has a lot of enemies.
THE GYPSY KING
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💯🇯🇲
That was awesome and hilarious.
Austin Theory has the perfect entrance theme for a MITB cash in😂
😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
😂😂😂😂😂
There’s Only One TYSON FURY 🥊
This is gonna be running gag isn't?
I guess you could say A town down.....on the floor!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The best highlight of the main event match
Yes! the changed his name back to Austin Theory !
Gypsy 🤴 🙌
Smokey would say "You're got knocked the f***** out."
Epic moment
Legends remember when Tyson Fury fought Braun Strowman at crown jewel in 2019
Damn, Reigns even has freaking Fury in his pocket!
Tyson Fury KOs Theory! And down goes Theory! Down goes Theory!😊
Who ?
theory: *me dreaming about my crush* fury: *my alarm clock*
Honestly Theory has to have the most difficult time I’m trying to cash in the money in the bank out literally everyone who’s win it
He still has his contract WWE making him save it for WM39
Congrats WWE! No one saw that coming
Way to make Austin Theory a non main event joke @WWE I did laugh but on a serious note dose this kid owe you money?
Booker T calls this gettin the RUB!
0:22 I cant stop laughing. 🤣🤣💀 funny how if you watch it a few times, ( i know its scripted) out of all the place in the world theory and the ref chose that spot to cash in just for fury to knock his @55 out 🤣🤣🤣💀
Finally he’s Austin theory again instead of just theory!! So glad HHH gave him his name back, now he actually sounds like he can be a main star for the company
This match had so many interruptions 🤣
Austin reaction do funny
So many daddies showing Theory love
really wwe.....you haven't cut ties with Fury yet........🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
So they just let Tyson Fury hit one of their wrestlers and not go to jail. That seems like some Vince McMahon nonsense
Props to Theory for taking a punch from Fury.  And it was right in the ear, oh god.
Jokes aside, I swear Theory successfully cashing-in would've been a better ending, than Roman retaining for the 1000th time, with outside interference... At least, it could've have been a middle ground, if Drew wouldn't be the new champion.
yo i had an orgasm. this is the best that ever happened to wwe/wwf
😂
Starting the feel sorry theory why is he everyone whopping boy
There's only ONEE TYSON FURY 🥱‼️
Well played
He's back to Austin Theory
Fury is the man period, Love how well Theroy sold it, he would quite literally knock the head off any wrestler in real life.
Someone standing over Theory.. " Hey..young man...YOU GOT KNOCKED THE F OUT!!" 😂😂😂😂😂
I love this moment🤣😆
Guess WWE paid that $500 million 😂😂
Why did he get involved?
I was really thought he was gonna cash in
I see he’s being called Austin Theory again instead of just Theory. 😆
Looks like we're getting Austin Theory vs Tyson Fury at Extreme Rules
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love wrestling!
Nobody wants theory in wwe be gone kid
Lol, idky but there's something funny about Theory carrying that suitcase that he had since back in Money in the Bank. And isn't this like the second time he got owned before cashing in?
Austin Theory suck 🤣🤣🤣
Oh dear, literally everyone is his enemy now
Theory is such a great talent, really clever how wwe are protecting these cash-ins
Snug much?!🤣🤣... theory didn't need help with the sell at least 🤣
Beat him worse than Deontay
2nd attempt (failed)
Tehory is not wanted by anyone🤣🤣🤣
What was better. Theory sell of the stunner or this?
Tyson Fury vs Austin Fury xD
I feel like this will be a running gag of Austin Theory coming out every PPV to cash in on Roman only to get wrecked lol
That KO'd send him to next year!!!
Thanks Triple H, thanks for returning Theory's original name 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Any other person in the crowd that’s assault and they’d be banned from any wwe event 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Theory may feel like Wilder - he wanted to win the championship belt, but was stopped by Fury
Did Drew win? I wasn't watching live
Even if it hit didn't hit fully, that would have been scary 🤣
Bro I wasn't sure about theory but after this I'm sold 😅🤣
That was one of the greatest moments of my life Tyson Fury KO Austin straight to hell man
That was funny he knocked out Theory...Because he can Corey Graves.👊👊😅😅😅🏰🐉🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🗡❤️💙💛🖤
Love this 😂
Am I the only Austin theory fan 🤣 I was hoping he would get the titles 🤦🏾‍♂️
WWE 2022 IS ON FIRE
😂😂😂😂✍🏾
Yo that looked legit
Theory had the balls to take a punch from Tyson Fury
The exchange of theory was good, he did it the same as in SummerSlam
You just got knocked the F*** out man! 😂🤣
This moment put a smile on my face
when the universe says no
Coitado do Theory tô começando a torcer por esse jovem kkkkk
Fix it quick wwe I'm waking up to clash of the castle not working on wwe network from Australia it's frustrating seeing spoilers now before watch the ppv
Big Show would be so proud XD
Look Like we getting Austin Theory Vs Tyson Fury
Too bad he didn't do the same when Roman actually cheated.
Once again Theory gets knocked out
Man, I really thought Theory was going to cash in and win but hey maybe next time, glad to see Tyson back in WWE.
Tyson Fury. The GOAT.
Lmao. A town got beat down
That was no gimmicked punch... Dude got f'n TKO'd by the Gypsy King

I wish Amanda Nunes becomes a wwe star she had so much potential.
Yesss he’s Austin theory again instead of Theory
What is Tyson business in the match making me wonder if his gonna be a heel or baby face
Best thing in all the show
Austin Theory probably punched air After Clash at the castle went off air
WYSON WURY
Austin Theory returns with the Money in the Bank Briefcase contract in 0:05. 😠. WWE makes a crossover cameo of World Boxing Council's legend Tyson Fury knocks the hell out of Theory. 0:25. 🥊😵. He gets what he deserved. 😆🤣😂.
