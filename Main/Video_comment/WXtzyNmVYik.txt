LAMAR is washed he needs to move to running back
Hard to imagine these experts comments
The score in Bill's vs  balt football game
The Steelers looked like the team that didn't practice.
THERE CALLING THESE GAMES WRONG! CLEVELAND ISNT THE SAME CLEVELAND!  AND BILLS ARE READY! GO BILLS/ BILLS MAFIA!
the bills did play well this season, but it think its jiust a flash in a pan  i dont see them making a deep run in the playoffs
ض
"So, how do you feel about the Browns and Steelers game though?"  "well.... it was good."  "okay, excellent, moving on to the next teams...."
When Tony dungy was a coach he looked like a custom character in a video game
Jalen Ramsey for DPOTY
Eerie  we eewwwwwewee
But I’m really proud of Cleveland man them boys wanna win
Can’t believe we almost lost to Washington bru I think we will bounce back and be stable against New Orleans yea they beat us twice but it’s hard to beat a team 3 times n one season and my boy Brady is a different animal in the postseason y’all know that but want accept it and then make y’all excuses when we win 😂🖕🏻
How is it RT is great? 🤣🤣DH got slowed down. Didn't RW had more pass attempts in 4th qtr than he had in 1st half?🤣🤣🤣🤣
Josh Allen was fantastic in this game and he is one of the young superstar QB's today and for the next 10 years or so. Allen NEEDS TO SLIDE OR GET DOWN more often OR his career will be short. Can't continue to do what he does and be injury free. It WILL catch up to him.
MARK MY WORDS THE TIME HE HAS A CHANCE TO WIN A SUPER BOWL IS IF MAHOMES GETS INJURED
I really hope we get to a bills vs chiefs afc championship game. If the rams do pull the upset on the packers, this defense is legit good. They might carry them to the super bowl as well.
These guys crack me up. Andy Reid study every team. they don’t listen to Andy press conference. Patrick mahomes study every team as well go chiefs
No speed round? :( Maybe next week.
“They got a great QB in Ryan Tanihill”  ... Me: um Ryan Tanilhill is NOT a Great QB🤨💀😭 he’s TRASH  Baltimore with the EASY dub💜🖤
I need a Chiefs vs Packers super bowl baby
Ravens vs Titians winner is the better running team
Go team
Someone actually pays these announcers lol what a joke.. How can you expect Henry to run when there are no openings, that was on the offensive line. I am not shocked that Steelers choked, they are way overrated.
Well, Tom Brady with Bill Belichick has not lost three times to the same team
actually the headline should read Steelers stun Steelers, 28 points in the first quarter 21 of those on Pittsburg turnovers
Brady has never lost to a team 3 times in 1 season before maybe because he’s never played a team 3 times in 1 season before....smh. Dumb comment.
BOOOO WE HATE LAMAR WE HATE LAMAR BOOOOOOOOOOOO GET A LIFE
His come only Lamars running yards are shown and you hype up all of Josh Allen as though Lama is a running back. Boy this media is wild. Want there heroes white.
The crowded quiet internally choke because cupcake neurophysiologically end plus a accessible pepper. abandoned, precious dust
*BELEEDAT* #8😈
Do people not realize the saints haven’t played with their full roster all year either lol. Plus drew already had a few cracked ribs that second game against TB
The therapeutic machine repressingly signal because second untypically place beyond a ossified rectangle. eminent, secretive radish
How good is Crystal Meth!
Did only I notice how fast the traffic lights are changing behind Mike Florio?
Mike “he needs to get going” Florio
They’ve had an excuse for the Buccaneers vs Saints BOTH times this year. They picked the Bucs to win AGAIN, smdh.
Worst part of the day is realizing we will have to put up with more horrible Baker Mayfield commercials
I wonder who the NFL owners are going to let win the SB this year.
It wasn't so much the Browns winning, as it was the Steelers imploding.
Mark my words right now lamar jackson and the ravens will run to a Superbowl and win they cant be stopped they just shut down maybe the greatest running back ever with ease ravens aint playing around
yak yak yak yak......
If you play worse then Lamar you are not a QB right hive mind fans? So by their typical logic Tannenhill isnt a QB but a WR (which is where he started in college) Henry is a DE not a RB, Mitch is a place holder not a QB lmao
Shout out to Jackson and Allen. They were labeled bums out the gate and proved everyone wrong.
I’ve heard of , “get right games,” in the NFL season before; however, I never thought I’d see a “get right game” in the Divisional Playoff round.  Yes, I mean that KC will crush Cleveland.  40-burger!  With cheese!
Literally dozed off right before kickoff and woke up to browns up 28-0 in the first 😳 crazy
Wish I had put some money on my picks...
The new king  king Jackson                                  🦾🥶
Change of title: "Steelers First Quarter Offense Stuns Itself"
The fabulous angle topically grate because coal logistically enter versus a upbeat building. hesitant, abrupt opinion
Go Browns!!
Browns could lose 40-7 next week and I think their fans would still be happy. The kind of win that makes the entire season feel like a success
This to me is the most interesting post season with all these great matchups coming up
BLACKS MEXICANS AND NATIVE AMERICANS AND JAMAICANS WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE BIBLE RESEARCH
The saints Defense is ferocious
Kareem hunt bout to go crazy next Sunday
Saints fan here. Id like to see either bills or browns in the superbowl. You guys deserve it
Seahawks need changes within the coaching staff. This defense + run first approach is outdated and unsuccessful. First game in the post-season and we got outcoached, outplayed and the Rams simply wanted it more.
Shock the world, let’s go Browns
Wow, they sure have a lot of confidence in the Bucs having a chance against the Saints despite that most recent beat down....
Same old Browns, eh?  How about SAME OLD STEELERS looking ahead to the marquee playoff team instead of the team they're actually playing?  Hey, Juju? Eaten enough of that humble pie yet? I'd thought you'd had enough during the regular season.
I seen it coming like I said u r go all the way
40 attempts is way too high .... but maybe TB had more time of possession.
Josh Allen aka "Star Lord" dude looks like Chris Pratt ... lol
Rams upsetting GB calling it now, Ramsey will clampdown Adams and the Rams get that run game cranking, LAR vs NO, KC vs BAL, KC vs NO
Go Browns
Not a browns fan but im glad they’re playing the chiefs. Id rather see high octane offense vs high octane offense anyday. And plus, kareem hunt vs his old team. Should be a shootout.
Go Browns Dawg Pound barking loud 1-0
dethroned
Pittsburgh regrets benching their starters last week and allowing Cleveland to get in the playoffs lol
I'd like to see the Ravens vs the Browns in AFC Conference.
Baltimore wild cat offense
Let's go Browns!!!!!!!! Dawg Pound baby!!!!!
Even Tim Tebow won a playoff game.
Bruce needs to watch his old Steelers team & run the football more.
Y'all said the same thing week 1 an week 9.... WHO DAT
FREAKY-L, BAAABYYY!!!
Cowboys got 5 Super Bowls.  We are America's team.  Don't ever forget.
In ten years when Josh Allen has two or three Super Bowls people will still be talking about that lateral he put up against the Texans.
I just wanna know did PUNK azz tony dungy pick against the Ravens b4 the game
Kareem Hunt is going to be kicking it in Kansas City again, ain’t that nice.
Let’s stay humble ravens fans, we’re already the underdog and we’re only getting better!
Who is this guy talking.
We dont deserve to win if we play like a f**k. I really want to vomit. The most shitiness game I ever see as a fan. All the other 10 wild cards teams fought hard to bring the game close, even Bears held on to Saint very well until the 4th quarter. Steelers just gave the game away. Errant snap, OL cannot block, RB cannot run, Ben forced to throw and commit mistakes, Def played as if they were jinxed. Congrats Brown btw.
Ravens won let's go
I'm a life long Browns fan and I've never felt this good after watching a game. Go Browns!
So Jackson outpassed Tannehill and outrushed Henry.
All the teams that were able to run the ball had success!
I know Stefanski didnt coach this game. But put a little respect to his name. He deserves a mention for coach of the year. They're able to win without Stefanski because the team looks a lot more mature. And Stefanski brought that mature culture to the team.
As a Steelers fan I couldn't be more happy for the Cleveland Browns. Wish the Dogg Pound nothing but success 🐶
A Cleveland vs. Baltimore AFC game would be poetic for the Browns and their fans.
Great quaterback in Ryan white analyst make me laugh at how Dey overvalue white players
Tru💤💤💤💤 the process 😈😈😈😈
Championship Round - Browns at Bills Buccaneers at Packers
Steelers been frauds all year
Go Browns! Man what a win. Destroyed the Steelers and still have a bunch of guys out of commission. One week at a time. For now, we’ll enjoy this win.
I don’t like the weird dude, cause he don’t like the saints. He brings up week 1 with the bucs like that’s the only time we beat em. He never has something good to say about the saints
2018 QB CLASS🔥🔥🔥🔥
Fucking Seahawks
Big Ben literally threw the game away for the Steelers. It's more about the Steelers blowing it than the Browns winning it. (I'm not a Steelers fan at all either.)
Steelers are the biggest 12-4 frauds in NFL history 😂😂💯
I hope the talking heads stop griefing Mayfield now.
BALTIMORE RAVENS WILL WIN SUPER BOWL 2021 BIDEN HARRIS 2021 TRUMP WILL BE ARRESTED 2021  DONT WORRY FELLAS THINGS WILL GET BETTER
Bucs vs ravens.  Ravens win
Wonder which ravens will show up vs the Bill's
Who dat
The biggest winners of this weekend are the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Ravens
Corvette Corvette
