Mark ogden, for you to bring out players who are best of their generations and trying to say maradona was fouled more etc is disgusting. Talk about a player who has consistently played at the epic level for 10 + years, talk about the evolution of the game, talk about who has won everything/most, talk about who has nade a massive impact for all the teams he has played for in the goat debate. Injuries are a negative setback in football but we shouldnt bring in injuries and say "injuries are what held Neymar or any other players career, without them injuries they would be better than that figure or this figure so it is pointless to choose the GOAT" on the basis of what if he didn't have injuries etc.
Mark ogden. Whenever you want to compare and contrast players from different generations, make sure you bring in team trophies, individual trophies, goals, assists, nō of games played, goals in final matches etc. the one who dominates most of the statistics carries the day regardless of which era he played for. Yes football has evolved very much because of the introductions of offsides, goal line tech, VAR, substitutes etc meaning todays football its impossible to win a game with a margin officiating error and meaning the poor officiating before now took part in other figures being big. E.g maradona against england in 86 mexico WC, the two goals he scored shouldnt have stood because the first goal he scored with the hand, the second goal he scored grand was fouled before maradona took the ball in midfield. They are many officiating errors i can give examples of but because football at that time wasnt more advanced, teams got an extra edge from poor officiating errors. In conclusion, Messi is the greatest ever because statistics say it all, trophies say it all, records say it all, individual trophies say it all and the world cup was a confirmation of what 30% +  of people knew about la pulga being the best ever.
The world cup 2022 final is the only match whenever am watching highlights of it am always fearing about what the end results might be. The nerves still play their part whenever am watching the highlights of it despite knowing that Argentina carried the day and the ultimate trophy.
Pele’ El Rey!
It was never a debate Messi is the best
Mark Ogden is an idiot.  "Someone else will come along".  The hate is so strong.  You know if it was Ronaldo who won the World Cup he would be talking about Ronaldo being the best of all time.  And Ronaldo IS far behind Messi.  He's close as a goal scorer, not close anywhere else.
I called Messi the greatest player I've ever seen in 2011 and nothing changed regardless of winning the World Cup or not. He was Maradona every week for 18 years 🐐
Cristiano Ronaldo is the greatest human to ever play football but Messi just is not human .I used to think Cr7 was the best ,but Lionel Messi opened my eyes .He has something that cant be measured in number . Cristiano Ronaldo is a machine .But Messi is a footballing prophet and revelation from the Almighty God who dwells above us .
Ronaldo will comeback in 2026😎
Mark Ogden😂 Go and watch Madrid literally trying to end Messi's career every game under Mourinho   Go see the game of Messi against Chelsea when Mourinho coached them  If he could survive that, he can survive anything  These bozos forget that Messi faced Sergio Ramos(the red card freak) and Pepe(the career ender)
Messi rocked🗿🐐 Penaldos cried🐪🤡
MESSI IS GREATEST OF ALL TIME 🐐👑
Who is pendu? He isn't even in the GOAT discussion. His biggest achievement was being compared to Messi. Maradona, Pele and Messi is a REAL GOAT DISCUSSION. Put Ronaldo alongside Gerd Muller, Bican and Romario.
MESSI GOAT🐐
😁😁😁😁😁😁
MESSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Messi is the GOAT. Ronaldo is nowhere near him lmfooo
Ogden is the dumbest critic ever
This mark Ogden as usual 😂
Worldcup is like having a badge of invincibility to be remembered by your country men throughout history and thats what makes the player great
Ronaldo 🐐🤴🇳🇵🇳🇵
Mark said original Ronaldo 😅😅😅
Messi=football 😊😊😊😊😊 Micheal Jackson=music😊😊😊😊😊
Dont dare compare zidane with Messi never
Dude just said ‘original Ronaldo’ 😂😂😂
I like ale Moreno.. he's a real guy
R9 is the best ever peak wise with one knee at that messi has never been better then R9 at 19 😵
Messi is a one team wonder who spent half his career in lower leagues against lower opposition. Imagine Michael Jordan leaving the Bulls to go play in Poland, doing nothing there and then moving to Greece and doing even less there while everyone keeps saying how great he is. Meanwhile LeBron keeps breaking records in the NBA and people still keep hailing Jordan as the greatest despite the leagues he's been playing in. Great players don't play in lower leagues period!
It's not about people's opinions anymore... It's about the catholic truth : MESSI IS THE BEST OF ALL TIME AND ALWAYS WILL BE FOOTBALL'S  NUMBER 1. All those who do not want to see that, will live in denial until they die
There was never a debate. One is a goalscorer. Messi isn`t just a goalscorer he is also the best playmaker in history.
He’s the GOAT!!🤚🏻👇🏻
Nah let be honest,the media marketing ploy need sell a story,so they created the non exist rivalry about G.O.A.T..the real debate about G.O.A.T is between Messi,Maradona and Pele.
Cr7 is the goat
Dude, read some history. Pelé didnt play a SINGLE minute on the first WC. hahaha
MESSI GOAT. Theres no argument. CR7?! hahaha. gtfo
I agree with all the panellist .. delusional kids love cr7 .. the guy is an influences .. football lover .. experts loves messi
Messi was much better than Ronaldo before the World Cup win. Not hating on CR7 because he's a freak of a footballer but messi is just something else altogether 👍
Messi lovers stop disrespecting ronaldo I hate you
So if Ronaldo wasn’t in the frame, Messi would have like 20 Ballon D’ors 😬😬
Argentina managers & players say Pele is   the GOAT     Hello everybody,   N.B. My apology, you may have seen this message in other blogs      In recent times there have been many articles and debates on      Maradona vs Messi, who is the greatest?  Video underneath (in Spanish but we can translate it)  Copy and paste it if necessary, also as it is at the bottom of this message, (duration: around 18 min)   More comments are below it    ￼￼  PELÉ el MEJOR de la HISTORIA 🥇 🏆 ⚽ 🇧...    Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi may be more similar that we think           The difference is that   One won the World Cup / became a national hero / became more outspoken in his career nearly 10 years before the other one    Maradona & Messi are two wonderful players that we want in our team        but remember football is a team sport   Without Messi:     * Barcelona won the 2006 Champions League final - injured     * Barcelona & PSG have  been doing well -  since leaving the clubs   Without Maradona, Argentina won:     * The 1978 World Cup - left out of the squad     * 2 Copa America (1991 & 1993) - during his international break         Something Diego couldn't do (1987 & 1989)   Without Pele:     * Brazil won the major part of the 1962 World Cup - injured     * Santos won 2 games of the 1963 Intercontinental Cup final - injured   Without C. Ronaldo:     * Portugal won the Euro 2016 final - injured     * Man Utd won the 2023 League Cup - after leaving the club   Great players have very good teammates around them   The same applies in the World Cup       * In Qatar 2022, Messi won the trophy alongside top players (Alvarez, Di Maria, Martinez, etc ...)                but it seems that      * In Mexico 1986, Maradona's teammates (Burruchaga, Ruggeri, Valdano, etc ...) were a bit better             Then it can be argued  that   the difference between Maradona & Messi wining the World Cup 'single handedly'             is that  Maradona did it with a better squad, better players around him              and in the most important match,  The World Cup final, Diego had a quieter game because of the marking by West Germans, notably Matthaus.             This is when Maradona's teammates stepped in & helped him achieve his dream of winning the World Cup.   Perhaps, people who have seen all the great players can have a good opinion on who is the best.   In the same video above and underneath, Argentines debate      N.B.: Let's remember that Argentina have had many world class players (Kempes, Passarella, ... Batistuta, ..., Aguero, etc ...)               and       3 great players (Di Stefano, Maradona, Messi) & maybe more to come   The people in the video include:     * The three managers of Argentina when Maradona was playing - Menotti, Bilardo, & Basile (who also coached Messi)      * Journalists      * Former Argentine players   Rem.: They may rank Messi higher now since leading his country to Copa America & World Cup glory   However, for them the greatest footballer of all time is Pele    N.B.: video link is below    Regards,      Chris     PELÉ el MEJOR de la HISTORIA 🥇 🏆 ⚽ 🇧🇷 . Qué dicen los argentinos❓  🇦🇷 - YouTube   PELÉ el MEJOR de la HISTORIA 🥇 🏆 ⚽ 🇧🇷 . Qué dicen los argentinos❓  🇦🇷
Actually, I never understand why the medias ve created that goat conversation between Messi vs CR7   Cuz anyone who understands football will say that Messi is undoubtedly the best (not only Cristiano) but the best of all time!!!     I'm sure, that we'll never see anything like Messi again!  Once in a lifetime!   The maestro, a genius, a magician, an alien!!!!  The GOAT F-O-R-E-V-E-R 🐐👽🏆🇦🇷
Blind & jealous Mark Ogden 👎
Ale is so eloquent here. 👏
Who is the real goat of football? The GOAT of football in the 21st century: Who comes out on top? Lionel Messi Lionel Messi is widely acknowledged as the GOAT of football in the modern era and is also considered by many to be the greatest player of all time or the GOAT in history.
why is messi the greatest player of all time? No player in history other than Messi has been the best goal scorer, dribbler, and passer in the world. Pele was the best scorer and probably dribbler but was never the best passer in the world. Maradona was the best dribbler and passer at a point, but was not the best goal scorer.
Good luck and congratulations Messi 👑🏆🐐❤️🙏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Messi is the goat
Stupid to bring your emotions into judging who is the greatest.   Even Messi haters know quite well  that hes the GOAT  but just wont admit it.
Messi became the GOAT in his mid 20's
The world cup is the barometer to those who used to say Messi is not the best because he didn't have a trophy with Argentina.
He was the greatest 15 years ago. Goat of Goats.
Kicked, battered or what, Messi remains unparalleled... its mind blowing to come to think in almost  any statistic relevant to an attacker Messi dominates or atleast competes...
Ronaldo plays football for fans. But Messi plays football for professional footballers who learn something from Messi.
Ronaldo the goat the best ever
Come on man why is the Messi vs Ronald even a debate? We all know Messi is way too much better than him.
Put prime Messi in that France squad and with a straight face tell me he doesn’t win back to back World Cups …..you can’t
The last guy is dumb. he didnt asnwer the question.  messi is btetter  than everyone, thats a fact
The last guy simply doesn't understand what he is blabbering! He is just reluctant and may have some personal issue in accepting Messi as the GOAT.
Cristiano is for sure an all time top 10 player. 2nd best Ronaldo. Should not even be mentioned with Messi, Maradona, or Pele. That's not a knock on Cristiano, that's just how much better those players are.
Slap mark ogden
There's no comparison Messi is the greatest Ronaldo is wonderful but when you compare him to Messi it's laughable tbh he has never scored a World Cup knockout goal he doesn't contribute the same to his teammates and he has had way better starting 11s than Messi in his national sides I think CR7 is an icon of the game a brilliant footballer but compared to Messi he leaves me cold, bored and uninspired he is nowhere near him even more so after the World Cup win.
U can talk about Messi, Maradona or Pelé. And Messi is the best. But Cristiano Ronaldo has nothing to do with that conversation. Cristiano can be compared to Ronadlo nazario or Ronaldinho, who I like more (both of them) and they aren't neither in that conversation.
anyone comparing Messi to Ronaldo doesn't understand football.
Let's put it this way. Ronaldo is a legend, he will go down in history as one of the greatest ever. But i've seen players at his caliber. Ronaldinho, Ibrahimovic, Mbappe, Haaland... they're all right up there with Ronaldo. No player compares to Messi... that's the difference. There is no universe where he is matched. That's what separates a "great" from a "god"
5:38 - Zidane wasn't the best of his generation, Ronaldo Phenomenon was ☝
Zidane wasn't the best of any generation. Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Romario and Rivaldo were better in my opinion.
How dare to mention Ronaldo? CR7 is not evena  top five GOAT. You need to mention Pelé y Maradona not any other player. Pele and Maradona are not even in Messi's table but please dont disespect other legends with CR7
He also the best and give other chance to play more than any other assit.messi the real goat🎉
Qatar sponsoring espn, PSG and world cup host..sus
No doubt,GOAT Messi best player in history of ⚽️
Messi was always the GOAT 🐐
Messi is better than Ronaldo  but for  me pele is number 1
Mark Ogden has never kicked a football in his life lmao😂lmao😂
Messi sealed the argument. Messi the greatest footballer ever. Messi the GOAT.
Maradona the greatest for ever ❤❤❤❤❤
Now he hasn't have to say about Mbappe so he chooses pele😂😂😂
The guy from 7:00 you can see he’s Cristiano’s fan hahahahahahahahahahaha he’s not happy at all! Hahahahahahahahahahahah
you realize people don't have a f* clue about football when they talk about the GOAT debate and mention the word Ronaldo, the only ones that had enough saliva to shine Messi's shoes were Maradona and Pele.
Cr7 is the goat but Messi all day
8 ballon dr incoming and super ballon dr in future
La diferencia entre Messi y Ronaldo, es la misma que hay entre Argentina y Portugal. Es comparar a uno de los tres mejores equipos del mundo con uno medianamente bueno. El que no entienda que Messi es el mejor jugador, no entiende nada de futbol. A nadie que sepa algo de este deporte le importa la cantidad de goles sino la forma de jugar. El futbol sudamericano es arte, el europeo puro físico.
It's not about trophies. Messi has insane stats with no height, uses one foot and he is a Mid. Who else can be like that?
Everyone knows who is best player in football history,No doubt is king of football Leo Messi🇦🇷
If only these fanboys had a bit of a brain. Maradona is the most gifted player there has ever been.   These fanboys know nothing about football. Messi has done nothing in any world cup he has played in, as he does not have the ability to play well against the best international players. Also, Messi in 80s Barcelona would have had zero Ballen d'or  and more visits to hospital than goals.   Messi is just a club level player. Maradona was a world beating player at the toughest of times to play football ever. If Maradona played in this era, he would have scored dozens of "Goals of the century" because he would not be butchered like he used to be in every match he played in. Oppositions were frightened of him hence the brutality against him
Mark is a hater and genuinely jealous of Messi. He is making BS arguments! Just admit it and stop crying!
Messi took growth hormone to become professional. Pele' never needed sich thing!
Messi is second, after Pele'!
This guy talking about Maradona, has he ever seen guys trying to take down Messi? They tried everything but it didn't work. Rio Ferdinand said that he couldn't even get close to Messi. Meaning that he wanted to be physical with him but he didn't get the chance because Messi was too skilled and too fast. It was not that defenders didn't try hard enough to take Messi down, it's just that they couldn't. Defenders in the Messi era have even more reason to take him down as there has been too much talk about Messi for so long. Yet Messi was too much to handle. Sorry but as great as Maradona is, he's still just a little behind Messi.
If you are Messi, you need the world cup to shut up all the haters. He needs it. He is the GOAT without the Copa America and World Cup. But winning these trophies of his caliber and level, will silence all comparisons with Pele, Maradona, Cr7, Cruyff, Di Stefano, Best, etc. And Messi won it all. Individual and club level, he conquered it all. He can give PSG's 1st ever UCL will only give more painful life to his haters.
GREATNESS! No more debate. Messi is the G.O.A.T!
Seriously oggy, in 10 years time we'll see another one similar to Messi or Ronaldo?
Pele, Messi and Maradona are the best ever for me
CR fans r those who loves his lean 8 packs torseau, his looks, his suiii theatrics whereas Messi fans r those who loves watching qualité football loves the magic he creates...End of..period ........🤣
Cr7 all day
Don't be a prisoner to the moment. Messi is a great player no doubt but he's no pele or even Maradona for that matter.
You can't rule of 807 goals.....5 ballon dor...... 5 champions League.... European Championship......won the league in three different countries.... And won the top scorer in all the leagues........ Their are hundreds of record....... I can go on...c..ronaldo... Is in top five footballers of all time.... 🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Simply the best...! Best thing to watch... it is about beauty and joy he brings!
you all obsessed with GOATS! don't compare, just enjoy.
1. Messi 2. Di Stefano 3. Ronaldo 4. Maradona 5. Pele 6. Cruyff 7. Zidane 8. C. Ronaldo  9. Gerd Müller 10. Beckenbauer  Honourable mentions: Van Basten, Maldini, Ronaldinho, Romario and Platini This list is solely based on how they could manage a team and have more impact on a team individually. I know people may argue that Pele and Maradona should be ranked higher. But the reason for this is R9 was a monster in his prime which was way better than Pele and Maradona. Di Stefano clearly was been a better playmaker and he played under the worst conditions possible. Also, he took his team to glory consistently. Also, he could play in any position including the goalkeeper's. Pele has 3 WCs which is true but he wasn't even the best player in his team in two of them. He barely played one of them because of an injury; but his team still managed to win. He may have great numbers, but most of them are against small teams. On the other hand, Maradona doesn't have great numbers.
DiMaria scored in the Olympic Final, Finalissimo, scored the 0-1 goal against Brazil in Copa America Final which decided it for Argentina and created the first two goals of this World Cup Final. And yet nobody rarely talks about this absolute HUGE player. Amazing.
Pele is the best ever...he had 3 world 🥤
Pele is the only player to win three world cups at the age of 30 years old. 3 out of four world cups. Messi played in five world cups and won only one. Failed 4 times in a row. The majority of the world community and countries ranked Pele as the greatest player of all times. Go to most libraries of the world written books etc. And Pele is always ranked at the top of all players in history. Some say maradona is the greatest, some say Messi, some say Renaldo, some say Alfredo de Stefano. But judging by the majority of the world, Pele is universally accepted as the greatest and true King. Messi, Renaldo, maradona and the others are just immitations, that's why they all wear the number 10 shirt, All in Pele's shadow. Pele made the number 10 shirt into a symbol.
the BEST PLAYER EVER just died last night at 82 years old. THE ONE AND ONLY KING OF FOOTBALL..........PELE.................  It's an insult even to compare him with the fixed titles king messi. the qatar world cup WAS FIXED and the reffery proved that in the final the way he favored argentina.  all of you who say messi is the no 1 u are full of S H IT KNOW NOTHING ABOUT REAL FOOTBALL AND U INSULT THE REAL GREATS OF THE PAST.................PELE.....MARADONNA...KROYF.....PUSCAS....DI STEFANO....GEORGE BEST.......BEKENBAUER...........EUSEMBIO...GARINTSA.......ETC................ALL THOSE WERE A LOT BETTER THAN BEEP BESSI.  NOW GO CRY HARDER.....................PRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR   BESSI......WHO    ?
Messi is overrated. De Maria did much more and never gets credit.
Ronaldo is the goat
pele is most overrated player ... he won 3 wc coz of team
Messi is Media GOaT while Ronaldo is a LION. The king of Football
Ronaldo is still the GOAT💪🐐 We don't need rigged trophies🤧🤮
Ronaldo didn’t need handouts in his career to be considered the Goat. 5 ucl trophies with top scorer in every campaign. Unlike someone who claims a ucl trophy with close to zero contribution all tournament in 2006 lol.
Leo Messi 🦁🐐 is the GOAT of all time 🔥🔥
Messi is 100 light years ahead of Penaldo, But not maradona
Dont compare anybody to maradona.theres maradona then theres the top 10.these people in the modern era dont no jack about wot is soccer greatness.if u could pic one player to be in yor team mardona or messi at there peak i no who i would pic..maradona greaest ever to touch a soccer ball
Laura pundits
Mark Ogden you're an idiot.. you are assuming we don't give the past players their due respect.. Leo Messi is still the GOAT after giving the rest of the players their respect.. do you understand now?
Messi is the greatest of all time 🐐
ESPN and Foxsports need to up their analyst game. Who are these jokers ? Just rambling on
I agree with the bald guy (sorry i dont know his name) "There is no longer arguments other than emotional to put some other football player over Messi." But hey! Watch out, emotional arguments doesnt count as OBJECTIVE TRUTH. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Mark speaks like a politician not a football analyst. Ya. of course every generation has got its best player. So in every generation we are disrespecting a lot of wonderful players by singling out the best. There is no logic in your argument. But Mark we are not talking about that. We are talking about GOAT. So, if you don't believe in GOAT, why are you in the show?
AC Milan coach Pioli: Now there are 3 football legends of all time: Pele, Maradona and Messi
Ale Morena criticising every football game and asking other people to move on in life 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Messi may be the best, but the question isn't decided by a world cup that the Fifa Mafia rigged.
Messi was average at best in the world cup. French goalie was terrible,almost as terrible as their manager in the final.
Angel Di Maria penalty was clear dive.
Calling Messi THE GOAT, doesn't mean taking anything away from Pele or Maradona. They are at the Great level already.
We must glad , the eternal debate FINALY OVER !
Martinez is the goat
Messi - the GOAT. 😍❤
Finally the panelists can spew more venom on Cristiano Ronaldo.
Maradona is the goat 🐐
I'm sorry but how is Ronaldo even in this conversation? i don't get it.
Evolution of arguments...everyone that's claimed to be the best in any field, NBA, music, movie, boxing, no one uses the criteria of generation, they say best ever, Ogden admits Messi is best in this generation, then he enters the argument of G.O.A.T of all generations. I'll easily pick Messi still.
Mbappe needs to win a Champions League if he wants to even be considered… he still has time
Still Pele and maradona are on top
Messi and Ronaldo are equals. Mbappe is on track to be up there aswell
I always say to my friends who criticizes Messi. Just watch him play. Wheather you like him or not, he will make you fall in love with this beautiful game.
Only a woman would be so uninformed as to even begin to bring mbappe into the conversation,   really stupid,  Messi the greatest,  the debate is only maradona or Messi, the rest ain't on the same level at all, not even close
ESPN IS FULL IS BIGOTS
women in sports ah ha ha
Messi needs a lot help from OTHER world class players..
most goals ALL TIME CR7
World is fix side show run by scumbags
CR7 & GOAT..  Not close
I have watched football for decades now. Messi does things that are not usual. To say he is this that or the other is injustice, I have watched him play from his first game to now. In the national team they are all way below his level. If all the players he has played with in the national team were close by just one level, Argentina would have dominated football in the last 15 to 18 years. Those who trianed with him at Barca including Pep, say what you see on match day is 10% of what he does in training. So all this bka bla bla bla from us on the sidelines is just our emotions. Those who know the game know the truth.
The WC argument is silly. WC's are won by teams, not individual players. But when it comes to individual players, there are a number of factors you have to take into account. For me, Maradona will never reach Messi's level just because of the numbers. Six, maybe seven years at peak level against 15, not to mention club career, wherein there is simply no comparison. In terms of talent, it's subjective, because talent can't be measured. And, as Ale mentioned, there is the emotional factor. Older people will tend to gravitate toward their early years' preference. And then there are factors like professionalism, sportsmanship, discipline, (both on and off the pitch). Surely those count for something, don't they? And in that respect, Messi is way over Maradona hands down.   As for Cristiano Ronaldo, to anybody that knows anything about football, it was never a debate. You have to respect him for his effort. He simply never had the talent of the truly greats, but he managed to make his mark on the basis of hard work and discipline. But that will only carry you so far. If he had put in the same effort at being more of a team player, it would only have increased his greatness. But his obsession with being greater than Messi got the better of him. Today, at the end of his career, with a different attitude, he could be mentoring younger players and sealing his place in history. But that takes a certain kind of modesty, which sadly, he never had. And so he leaves this WC on his own without even greeting his teammates. That alone speaks volumes.  Now, when it comes to Pele, again the silly argument is put forth that he won 3 WC's. No, he didn't. Brazil did. Furthermore, in 62 he only played 2 games. In 70, he played in a star-studded team, where every player was almost as good as he was, and he wasn't even the top goal scorer.  The only games he played in Europe were friendlies, accounting for 1/3 of his supposed 1.000 goals. In South America, after winning 2 Copa LIbertadores, Santos pulled out of the tournament because there was more money to be made at less risk in touring around Europe for what were little more than exhibition matches. Yet this is hardly ever mentioned in any debate. And I'm saying this at age 68, so I've seen them all.   I have to agree with the likes of Iniesta and other great players and coaches. Messi is the GOAT because he's done things that no one else has done, and he's done them for 16+ years. And... he's not even done yet.
I used to be a ronaldo fan until messi got the world cup to the knee 😂
0:52 Ale has summed it up for me.👏👏 Nothing else to say.
We re fortunate to have enjoyed two greats of this calibre at once and for so long. All those other greats had peaks of five years maybe - these two have owned the ballon d or for the past two decades almost. Incredible standard . U can’t fault Messi’s career now.
Both are amazing - ronaldo is the best athlete but messi is an artist- his creativity and mind are unmatched
I saw Pele with the Cosmos at Yankee stadium.   For his age he was still amazing.  He could jump so high and used his leverage, skill, low center of gravity to be strong a no 9 (7).  Maradona was constantly kicked but was so fast, skillful and amazing.  After Owen and Shearer plus other Continental stars were getting hurt due to kicking brutally the owners/executives decided to change the game.   Leo is the best of his time but I still have him equal with Pele and Maradona.   I did see Messi play in Giants stadium for the Final of Copa Centanario and I saw him train with MSN…so amazing and Neymar was on 🔥 in that session.   The big 3 is Messi Pele Maradona
Ma quale dibattito 😂😂 per voi giornalisti e per gli ignoranti😂 Messi è sempre stato molto più forte
100 agreed. Lionel Messi is the greatest football player of all time!
Mr Ale, I agree with you!
ESPNMESSI FC - you can bark as much as you want - we know who is our GOAT.
Messi stepping out of Madara shadow? Wake up to reality
If only Alex can talk football like mark
Put some respect on cr7 name. There is a reason messi and Neymar didn’t go and play in the uk. They do not want to get hurt. They prophecy Messi like he created soccer. I’m sorry but   Hats off to xavi and iniesta to me they are the goat
For me, this doesn't end the debate. Messi has always and will always be better.
Never been any doubt Messi not just for his goals for his incredible passing range, link up play and over 370 assists. He is a magician ,has the X factor that others don't.
*MESSI THE GOD OF FOOTBALL*
He hasn't just won the world Cup,  he's been player of the tournament,  in the copa and the world Cup 2 years in a row .   Unprecedented
That we agree I would like by the way my privacy too
Funny how the Cristobal fans NEVER said he has to win the World Cup to be considered the Greatest, yet they beat Messi with that stick ALL THE TIME. Now that Messi has won it they have something else to say.
Messi is out of this world l. Cristiano is good but he's more of a hater than a player
End of the forced GOAT debate. Shame on whoever started the GOAT debate. U'll never see heaven
The goal by Messi should have been disallowed.   Argentinian subs were on the pitch when he scored which is strictly prohibited
Pele the goat
Mour will win world cup with CR7 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 Will the debate come back? 😉😆😂🤣
Mour will win world cup with CR7 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁 Will the debate come back? 😉😆😂🤣
You all forgetting Erling Haaland! OK!
Your goat playing at Psg under the shadow of Mbappe..Your goat won't make hattrick twice in English Premier league at 36 yrs..Still keep chasing Cristiano in terms of goal scoring record in football itself, in international football, champions league, career league goals..If World Cup is the biggest criteria, how many does Pele lifted??🤔🤫
Absolute GOAT
Cristano Ronaldo has acheived more than enough to become the highest goalscorer and recieved utter hate because he played in the same era with messi but but cr7 is the european born player to date time will come people will acknowlede him
The best player ever TO treat a socccer.ball are  PELE, MARADONA, RONALDINHO Messi
It's all over n no doubt about it...the greatest player is MESSI...
Lionel Messi was the greatest before winning the World Cup. He just solidified it..I love morenos attitude about it. I prefer Lionel Messi as well.
2022- 23 stats of messi and mbappe for club and country Mbappe  : 28 goals  8 assists : 36 G/A contribution Messi      : 24 goals  18 assists : 42 G/A contribution  Messi  at 35 is still competiting and have better stats than 23 year old mbappe.
G.O.A.T MESSI
Mark Ogden thinks he’s smarter than he actually is, literally sat there and made up a conflict , the question was who is the best ever just answer and move on
I’m sick of ppl like this moron talking about “ we gotta respect those who came before “ like bro shut up that’s wasn’t the question
Pele is the 🐐  behind is missi then mordna
Ale spoke nothing but facts
Winning the WC still doesn’t make him better to me. I still believe CR7 is a better player and the real GOAT of this generation.
Ronaldo as broken more records and scored more goals case closed
It's almost an insult to consider anyone above Pelé, his World Cup success and his stats per game are way above Messi's
Short sided commentators , Pelé is the king. Moreno talks rubbish
According to Mark we could say Maradona was the Best Player of Last Century and Messi Best Player of This Century 🐐🐐
It was a worst year for cr7 , firstly his team was not the part of champions league, Then he lost his baby boy, Then all this drama regarding his attitude and ego, after all those great years he got benched regularly by a manager.. Didn't score or contribute much in any of the matches he played, fired from his club in the mid of the world cup...got benched again at the world cup, Lost the world cup and forever lost his biggest dream to win the world cup, No big club is now interested in him, And the final blow was messi winning the world cup. The thing which settles the debate that was heated for like 15 years. He is one of the most hardworking footballers in the world , certainly one of the top 5 greatest footballers of all time, the most popular man on the planet, the man who inspired many people across different professions , but now everyone is hating him and trolling him everyday, it's hard for him and his fans, I request all the messi fans that the debate is over now, your messi has won the world cup, But don't troll Ronaldo and his fans, He also given many memories to football...So show some class guys.
Mbappe is not even close to messi and never will be, he doesn't move the same amd his game is different, you just can't beat messi
When Messi won the WC many people say GOAT debate ended. Before Ronaldo portugal never in their history has won a WC. Atleast Ronaldo made everyone believe and had some hope that they can win a WC. Ronaldo won Euro the second most watched tournament after Fifa world cup. Ronaldo is the most influentional person in the history of sports. He has broke all records and conquered everything. Cristiano Ronaldo is still the GOAT and will always remain ❤
It doesn't mean that.
Ronaldo? Is this a joke? He was benched at ManU and for Portugal. Meanwhile Messi was making insane crosses and goals during the WC Final.
Messi leaving Barcelona was a blessing for Argentina
6 or 7 penaltys and easiest way to the finals. y'all wanted him to win why act surprised
Messi is not the Goat.  He needed Di Maria to give him his 1st WC.  Maradona single handily took on a powerhouse German team and won. That is Greatness.
Had Messi even not won a WC he still would have been a GOAT along wid CR7, but with just one man show n a brilliant GK (But a scumbag in terms of professionalism) and controvertial refreeing discissions in their favor and just a burst of brilliant 70 mins of football only in the finals (Eventually failing again to maintain the 2 goal lead 🤣🤣), and playing against a team whose 5 of main starting 11 got flue from room AC out of nowhere just before the finals, ARG by no means were d deserving World Champions, and if it settles the Debate of GOAT then my frnd u don't love d game n u need help🤣  Also a reminder to all Messi fans....the 09 UCL final in which Messi (Barca) defeated CR7 (Man U) that to was a help to Barca to get to the finals....bcz Chelsea was robbed badly in the 2nd leg of Semis at Stamford Bridge.....If u can't win fair n square n then brag about ur achievements n disrespect others then ur gamesmanhip is a BIG ZERO.....  At least about that 09 Barca everyone can say that had the robbing might not have happend maybe Barca could have won the Semis on Merit bcz dat team was legit, but as far as this ARG team goes they were just a Quater Final quality team🤣 Easy group, Easy side of the knock out draw, Controvertial ref discission going in favor🤣🤣what more can u ask for🤣....instead of spending $220 Billion they could have easily organised a mega parede in Buenos Aires and Gifted Messi the Trophy directly....that would have saved Billions of Dollars, Millions of Emotions, would have kept the sanctity of the trophy and the left out Billions of $ would have been put into good use for development....
diego played at a time when there was no player protection, the defenders were strong and brutal, they targeted the legs directly, especially with maradona who suffered broken legs and came back better than he was. maradona because of him football has become the most popular game. maradona is a charismatic leader who went to Napoli when he was in the bottom and made it a giant team. messi, when he was playing with Barcelona, ​​was one of the biggest teams at the time, and included great players such as ronaldinho and eto'o. there will never be like diego, his outstanding, bewitching touch of the ball will always remains the best
How zidane was the best of his generation Ogden plz stop the real Ronaldo aka R9 aka fatboy was the best of that generation ofc a European wud spew that folly 🤣🤣🤣🤣
They were all great players but Messi is THE GREATEST and to my mind he will stay . FOREVER
MESSI THE BEST EBER AND FOREVER.
The debate is not over Messi FC
No. Pele, then Maradona, Zidane, R9, Ronaldinho aswell. The current era of player are so privileged and benefit from football being a non-contact sport. Also pitches being pruned superbly and light footballs. Then all of the associated care around players today. But Pele has to be number 1, and with 3 World Cups that kind of settles it, and he was the first. He was not protected either on the pitch. Maradona- he was taken out in the 1982 World Cup. Ridiculous fouls on him which didn't even get yellow cards. Maradona got more protection in 1986, but during his prime Maradona was more subtle on the ball, elegant and more of a leader than Messi was during Messi's prime. Just my view. I grew up as a kid watching Maradona, and seeing videos of Pele. The players today seem more pampered and engineered. Messi defo in top ten best ever, but not the greatest ever player.
They r so easily writing offffff ronaldo so easily so shameful just can't see it anymore
Messi has 7 ballondor and mbappe has 0 how can it even be a conversation
Nah. Messi is the greatest of all time. It’s Messi, then Pele and Maradona. This guy is just a hater and can’t admit that Messi is the best. He’s been dominating the game for more than a decade.
Honorable mention to how beautiful Kay is post pregnancy...straight fire 🔥
Messi is a good player, but you all kiss his @** too much.
Keeping in mind that other finals have been not good, this final represented football excellently. There are kids whose love for football sparked on December 18, 2022.
There was never a debate for pure football fans.❤
Ronaldo in 2026….
Because you live in a country that is able to win the WC makes you the goat? Such nonsense reasoning
World Cup is the final piece for messi career and that separated him to CR7. CR7 for is second to messi until he win the world cup.
Messi is GOOT (Greatest Of Our Time) Maradona is GOAT
Bollux...
Yes all we needed was a zoom call filled with 60 year old has-beens that never touched a football in their lives while also simultaneously having Ronaldo live in their heads rent-free while they're working for a failing network to tell us that Messi winning a team-based competition means he's better than Ronaldo. These clowns think their opinion matters 🤡💀💀
To those who understand the game, Its not even a debate.
Scripted WC i’m not impressed
Crnt really say that about Messi he's had a good career but for me Brazilian Ronaldo Pele Maradona
I mean why so much competition and debates both are the legends
Seriously😒
Messi is the G.O.A.T!!!! No debate Please
I never knew Iniesta spoke English so well.
Messi is the greatest player all time complete player vision in the match chirurgical passes key passes dribbles scoring construction play one on one percution he do all things in football  Ronaldo just goalscorer point
Messi is nothing in front of Maradona.... Messi has all the support from fifa, referee, opposite players, team mates, fans, media.. etc...
i agree that messi should ne the GOAT because he won with his skilles so bye bye 👋  Ronaldo
If Maradona was born and played in Portugal, CR7 and Portugal would have received the same respect as Messi and Argentina today... Maradona is the real reason for the Argentina fan base today... Maradona is greatest of all time...
I never doubted... MESSI is a unique player! Excellent! CR7 is good...But not that good!!!
Messi got Maradonas position but Pele still is something else
Messi- Talent beats hard work Ronaldo- Hard Work beats talent
Not for me he’s not even in the top ten
Mbappe is going to be an absolute demon in his prime. His record now at his age is frightening and his total goal tally in the last 2 World Cups is extremely impressive for someone so young
I'm literally NEVER engaging in this GOAT debate ever again. I've been a long time Ronaldo fan but i guess it's time to accept reality. What messi did at this tournament at 35 is just unbelievable.
I find it funny when folks bring in mbappe. Let him do this consistently for 15 years like Messi and Ronaldo. Then we will see if he is worthy or not.
When He said "The Original Ronaldo" 💀💀💀🤣😂🤣😂
The media is going milk Ronaldo for all he got. Messi has been the greatest footballer before and will be for a while. Leave Ronaldo alone. Dude has had enough at this point. Come on. I agree 💯 Messi I prefer him, and he has been out of Maradona's Shadow a while, unless you love him just for love sake even before world cup win. Mans lost a lot already can he at least have his self esteem got Dem, get of his meet.
Thankfully I missed the whole world cup.
Messi - growth hormones.   Ronaldo - clean.
I don't understand why you comparing natural gifted player and hard worker. Messi Is natural gifted and Ronaldo is a hard worker and they both achieved a lot of good things I think instead of comparing them we have to appreciate what they did for us. ESPN we love you but stop showing us how you hate Ronaldo
MESSI GOAT 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Messi fail for almost a decade in champions League and WC is far away from mbappe and Pele lol
Yes Messi is no.1. But if electricity goes off and there is loads heading, Messi should not be afraid of ghost 👻 because Pele & Maradona are also there. At the top of the hill.
Cristiano is the goat
Every soccer player knows that the toughest competition is in Europe. Cr7 has won two national championships with Portugal. Besides this he's won numerous club competitions in different countries in Europe. Yeah the debate has been over Cr7 remains number one "geniuses".
Espn been trying to get rid of Ronaldo for 19 years 😂
If Messi is best footballer ever then Pele is Worst footballer ever 😂😂😂 then why compare C Ronaldo, Maradona with Messi 🤔🤔🤔
I've always been a CR7 fan.. but I'm going to be honest.. with Messi winning the world cup it just feels like the Convo is over.. it just feels like everything that Ronaldo has done and accomplished is insignificant.. there's no way he can stand next to Messi now.. Messi has finally won the world cup
I'm with Ale. Messi is Messi.
Scaloni by starting DiMaria on the left flank caught Dedier Deschamps flatfooted. So were his players. That's how tricky Scaloni has been with his tactics in this World Cup after the loss to Saudis. He never gave away his tactical plans to his opponents -- intentional or not -- but that's how he played, tinkering his team every time -- catching his opponents off guard -- out in the open!
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Cristiano Ronaldo is the Greatest of All Time
Cristiano Ronaldo's top stats and achievements (for me):   - 5 Ballon Dor's (only behind Messi) - Top goalscorer of all time - Won 5 Champions League (only behind Francisco Gento, 1 for Man Utd and 4 for Real Madrid in 9 seasons, Messi won only 4 for Barcelona in 16 seasons!) And the number one: - The ONLY player in History to have won the 3 top European Leagues (English, Spanish and Italian) AND be the top goalscorer in all of them.  - People say Messi is the GOAT because he won the World Cup when Ronaldo didn't. You can't compare Argentina with Portugal. Argentina is a nation that already had 2 world cups and had one of the best players of all time (Maradona). It's one of the elite nations of football alongside Brazil, Germany, Italy, France and more recently, Spain. These are the 6 elite nations of football. With the exception of England's victory in 1966, EVERY world cup in the last 70 years has been won by one of these 6 nations. They dominate football. Portugal belongs to the second class of football nations, alongside England, Netherlands, Uruguay, Belgium and Croatia. Nations that are also strong in football but struggle to win competitions, because they are not still quite at the same level as the elite 6. And despite this, Ronaldo was a key player in helping Portugal win Euro 2016 with goal/assist contributions in 6/9 of Portugal's goals in that tournament, and bagging a key hat trick against Switzerland to help Portugal win the Nations League in 2019. The fact is that if Messi was Portuguese and Ronaldo was Argentinean, Ronaldo would have already probably won a world cup, and Messi would have probably never won a world cup. It's an unfair comparison, as one belongs to an elite football nation and the other one doesn't yet.  And the latter is not the only thing thats unfair. Throughout Ronaldo's career, the amount of hate that Ronaldo has received compared to the amount of praise that Messi has received is a difference from night to day. There has never been a player in HISTORY that has received more hate than Ronaldo did, and manage to bounce back multiple times. From the times when he first played in Manchester United when he was booed literally at every away stadium, to when he played in Spain and received even worse treatment at away games, even to the point of suffering xenophobia for being Portuguese in Spain with the famous chant "ese Portugues, hijo p*** es", no player has been so disrespected as he has been. Even in the Champions league, when he went to Germany, France or Italy, or when he played for Portugal in away matches, he received the same treatment when he got the ball, being booed all the time. Ronaldo has had to face a mountain in his career, Messi a ramp or trampoline. Always protected, never criticised. That just adds even more to Ronaldo's achievements.  And finally, people say Messi has won everything after the world cup and has nothing to prove. Wrong! Messi never played in England or Italy. He played in only 1 of the top 3 leagues. Was always in his comfort zone. Was bred by Barcelona, in one of the top teams of all time, with the likes of Iniesta, Xavi and multiple others, and that's why Spain the Euro 2008, WC 2010 and Euro 2012. A far greater achievement than Messi for Argentina. Why weren't they called the GOATS? When Messi finally left Barcelona, after its humiliating downfall in its last few years, he joined possible the strongest team in Europe relative to its internal rivals: PSG. I remember Ronaldo haters saying that Ronaldo's victories in Italy winning the league and becoming its top scorer after was nothing special because Juventus was by far the best team and didn't even managed to win the CL. Well, Messi never achieved those two things for PSG, DESPITE being in a much better team, and probably will never even win a Champions League with them.  Champions League, another interesting topic to talk about. Ronaldo won 5 (1 with Man Utd and 4 with Real Madrid), Messi won 4 (all with Barcelona). When Ronaldo went to Man Utd, the top teams in England were Arsene Wenger's Arsenal and Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, NOT Man Utd. Ronaldo was a key man in breaking that and putting Man Utd back in its place. The season 07/08, when Ronaldo won the English League, becoming top scorer AND winning the Champions League, in a team that was NOWHERE near Messi's barcelona was worth 2/4 Champions League that Messi won with Barcelona. Then, he goes to Real Madrid in 2009, at a time when Barcelona was by far the best team. He was once again crucial in ending Barcelona's domination and managed to win 4 Champions League titles with Real Madrid after they had failed to win a single one in more than a decade. He won 4 Champions League with Real Madrid in 9 seasons, the same number as Messi for Barcelona in 16 seasons! He played 7 less seasons and won the same number of Champions League for Real Madrid as Messi did for Barcelona in 16!  To conclude, if you think Messi is the GOAT because you consider him to be a magician like no other before him, fair enough, I can accept that. But don't tell me that his career has been better than Ronaldo's, because it hasn't. Winning a world cup with one of the elite teams, whilst the other never played for an elite international team (and still managed to win their first 2 trophies), is an unfair comparison as I mentioned before. Ronaldo, in my opinion, has succeeded far more difficult achievements in his career. Messi did his club career in one of the best footballing teams in History and then "retired" in the team that has the biggest disparity in internal opposition, whilst Ronaldo went to Man Utd at a time when Chelsea and Arsenal were the top teams, and won the league and CL and became the top goalscorer, then moved to Spain at a time when Barcelona was the top team and broke their hegemony, winning the league, becoming the top goalscorer and won 4 champions league in 9 seasons whilst Messi won 4 champions league in a better team for the most part in 16 seasons, and then Ronaldo went to Italy (arguably the easiest challenge of his top 3 league spells), but still a bigger challenge than going to PSG and still managed to win the league and become top goalscorer in his last season for them. As I mentioned, he was the only player in History to win the top 3 European Leagues and be the top goalscorer in all of them. This for more is his top achievement. An achievement that is conveniently forgotten or unknown. And when you add all the hate to his back (when Messi was always pampered in his comfort zone), it even adds more to this achievements. That is why Ronaldo will always be the GOAT for me, because no player in History accomplished so many unique challenges with so much difficulty. Today his best days are clearly behind him. He is about to turn 38 in February (Messi is 35, and Ronaldo at the same age was the top scorer of Serie A), and at this age it will be very difficult to bounce back, but hopefully in the future time will tell how much of a beast this man was, and how unfair so many people were to him. All the best to CR7, the true GOAT for me.
Cristiano is the best striker , but messi is the best player in the world but in history ,messi is a total player ,he broke the numbers of the best wings and the best playmakers  and attackers and the best midfield ,messi is not a box player but he is the best of them messi is a player of last tow -thirds of the field he do every things , my eyes did not see a player alike him and will never ,,, he is who finished the football series  ,,, messi  is not compared to anyone but messi .......
Messi is the best but Ronaldo is easily all time top 5 if not even top 3 in my opinion. What makes Messi the best is that he had to compete with another all time legend throughout his career. Ronaldos trophy cabinet speaks for itself.
Messi is GOAT
Messi is supposed goat in playing in top teams while ronaldo proved himself in other teams
Hand Off God🍊
I started watching soccer in 2008 because of Ronaldo.  I followed his career and rivalry with Messi and always loved the goat debate.  After Messi's World Cup victory, it's time to concede & acknowledge  Messi as the goat.
Messi winning this world cup ends the CR Messi debate. But if we’re honest to ourselves, in terms if football, it’s not even close.
If people mention mbappe i look sad cos that reminds me of neymar,robinho,mo salah,griezmann,coutinho etc when they coming up people say they will be goats were are they now,let them do what messi has done for 16years before you compare.Messi has done it for good 16years continuously.

Kylian does not count. He is young. What has he won without France National Team? He’s young. He still has entire life ahead of him. He’s next generation best player in FIFA. Ronaldo is an amazing Athlete. I will not deny that. But that is because he has trained for it. Messi has natural talent. Messi is the best play of ALL TIME. His numbers , tactical awareness, etc does not lie.. He’s achieved it all. Coming from a fan of Football. Not individual players.
🥇⚽💪🔥🔥🔥🔥Messi is a great player.. best player of history!  I'm happy I got to experience his talent! Congratulations Argentina!!!
People saying Messi now overtakes Maradona because he won the WC. On penalties against Holland and France. Messi was already the best prior to the WC.
Well...I can't say Messi is better than Pele, cause Pele won two world cups. But everything else is true. Maybe Mbappe can beat Pele.
I don't want to be disrespectful to Ronaldo, cause he made futbol entertaining, but Messi is clearly the GOAT.
Score penalties can be the best.
It could be Mbappe or there could be a kid somewhere, kicking a ball in a poor part of the world completely unaware of their talent. The most beautiful thing about football is that we will always have the heroes of the past, the heroes of today and the heroes of tomorrow. It truly is the Beautiful Game
They're both goats 🐐  but Messi is 1A Ronaldo is 1B. A World Cup is official status #1
Messi is easily better than all the names name dropped in the video because he’s a scorer AND an assister. He has the records to back that up. That’s the conclusion to the convo. Messi is GOAT
I am from the same generation and I dont thinkMessi is better than Ronaldo. CR7 in Argenina, Brazil or France, he would have 3 WCs
More biased and one sided views I hear, more I think how great CR7 is. After all these baised media, he won so much!!!!!
CR7 is better.
What a bunch of bulshit from Ronaldo haters
just my Opinion  ofc every sport got the GOAT debate but Those like real haters who hate on everyone but their "GOAT" Should just shut up Appreciate greatness and be grateful to see these greats play.
Ronaldo fans are 14y old, skinny, without tv cable to watch any match. They want to LOOK like him, that’s it
댓글 쓰고갑니다 ㅅㄱ
3:10 are we gonna act like he never retired?
Let's not forget to thank Nicolas Ottemendi for getting bored and giving away a needless penalty when there was no need for the bonkers end to end brilliance of the last 40+ mins and penalties.
Ronaldo it’s good he loved he’s job.
FIFA shown their full support for Argentina
Super 👏👏👍
i managed to watch parts of the football match and tbh im not kept up with it myself so i didnt realise ronaldo was playing against messi however i do hate this whole debate of who is definatively the best football player or most skilled and or talented. 1st of all people shy away from the fact that both teams are very good teams with many great players who played on the field that day and it only really came down to the teamwork of each team if anything it also came down to penalty goals so if it was a 3 3 tie down to pens, that surely should convince people enough that despite messi's team winning against ronaldo's team, both teams struggled and put their all into it. to say ones better than the other just isnt something u could really even argue with a good enough point.   people need to just realise that they are just very good players and thats it. its not about this competition of whos better and whos worse it comes down to who wins the game.
Settled - Its Pele
Messi biased page 🤣
The goat debate is far from over. Messi won a world cup that he was given and rigged for him to win. He got a penalty every game to win the trophy so nothing impressive there at all. Fifa and Qatar officials who hosted the tournament made sure he won that. No other team in world cup history got a penalty every game they played in so anyone with a brain can see that this was rigged. Ronaldo on the other hand is still the top international goal scorer, top champions league goal scorer and has the most hat tricks over any other player. So comparing those achievements to a world cup that was rigged for you to win ends the debate and Ronaldo is the goat.
😂😂😅🤣
Best 🇯🇲🇯🇲
ESPN pundits how meney times you have to keep talking to the def the dum the blind about  messi ERA is presently now and maradon and pele is the 80s and 90s the are getting on like children only debating nothing slow minded ignorant hatters grow up ladies  🇦🇷😍👉🏆🏅😡😣😔😳
Machikney takle
Lmafooo…..he say “your hairline doesn’t say so”!!! 🤣🤣🤣 a lot stress I see👀
On monday Messi played 180 minutes where as Mopbbabe played 7o minutes only after france scored penalty .
No is not better
Dirk Nowitzki schafft's nicht bei 'nem Charity-Event einen Elfer reinzumachen, selbst nach Wiederholung, und macht hier jetzt auf Fußball-Kenner... Die Auszeit bekommt dir nicht, Dirk.
Messi is not the GOAT because time hasn't ended you numpties
This is the biggest fix in World Cup history. Here are some facts which will result in Messi fans telling me to "cry more" and call me a "hater", but won't be able to properly refute.  - Messi plays for PSG. The Emir of Qatar, which is the Head of State and the most powerful position in the country, owns PSG.  - The President of PSG is also the chairman of Qatar Sports Investments. They make every sports related decision in Qatar.  - Hassan Al Thawadi, who is the Secretary General of the World Cup Delivery and Legacy Committee, said this before the World Cup: “Seeing Messi lift the trophy in what could be his last World Cup would be something really special for us as organizers. There are many fans of Argentina and Leo Messi in Qatar, and, for many, Argentina will probably be their second team after the Qatar team.”  - Argentina was awarded the most penalties in World Cup history. It wasn't until their final game that they were finally given a penalty against.  - After Argentina's game against Netherlands, Messi criticized the referee. To this day, Messi has not faced sanctions. That referee was then sent home. He was the only one to be sent home the entire tournament.  - There were 3 cases where Argentina was awarded a penalty where there was no VAR check.  - Messi was not carded for his blatant hand ball. He got one later in the game which would have made him get sent off.  - Messi scored a penalty goal where was a blatant encroachment and it was not retaken.  - Paredes got a yellow for a foul, but immediately after kicked the ball into the dugout and did not receive another yellow.  Messi announced that this was going to be his last World Cup, which is why Qatar didn't favour other PSG stars like Neymar and Hakimi, and Mbappe had already won a World Cup.
I said to my peers that if messi wins the World Cup I’d swap my top twi about … I have and it’s a no brainer now
Mark ...... did you see any empty seats 💺
Leo Messi 10 ⚽ goat of all goat's 🐐
Beautifully said by Ale Moreno.
Messi is a G.O.A.T.🐐
This was by far the best match i have ever watched mbappe ,camavinga and coman were awesome. Ya messi atlast has got what he was looking for. 🙂 The only thing is that ESPN FC should actually change their name to MESSI FC OR HATERONALDO FC or so.  Whatever ronaldo does i have not heard once they praising him. I am a neutral and enjoy both these legends playing but the hate ronaldo gets is unbelievable
with all due respect Messi wasn’t even the best player on the field in yesterday’ s game. I don’t understand the obsession at giving 1 player all the credit for a win that was a total team effort  all players on the Argentinian team played as good if not better than Messi, the two players that contributed the most were di maria and the keeper that saved the game at the very end.  enough is enough one man can never win a match by himself don’t care what your name is, unless you are playing singles tennis
And 8 ballon dior
No this dosent settle it.....Ronaldo is the 🐐
1.Messi 2.Ronaldo     3.everyone else
Ronaldo is still the GOAT he did it in 3 top leagues he won the Euros with his country in France backyard. If he was From Argentina or Germany or France he would have had at least two world cup medals. He has carried Portugal for years. It's easier to win a world cup if you are from Argentina in comparison to Portugal.
Messi is not the greatest of all time. Times and era are different and if they switch places for Ronaldo and Messi for Diego and Pele tns convo wouldn't even come up
Contractual obligation to talk about Ronaldo    actually sounds true
Still think Ronaldo is the greatest mainly because he has better statistics even without the World Cup.
Messi is the goat even if it wasn't for argentina 😍
World cup is not ending   Next for CR7
Finally the discussion about who's the GOAT is over. Really glad Argentina won although I was cheering for France.   Messi has what Ronaldo was never able to accomplish although he played on a stacked national team all his career
What I don't think Mark understands is that by us saying Messi is the goat doesn't mean that we're disrespecting anyone else. Being in the top 10 players of all time is nothing to be ashamed about.
PELE got 3 and wasnt even the best player on his team in 2 of them...
Always cr7... it's siuuuu
This debate is eternal.. for as long as we live this debate will forever be...
I'm glad I was able to experience these 2 players, but I'm just as glad that the 2 are finally over.  got really annoying...
Ale coming with the FACTS over FEELINGS. Thank you. MESSI IS THE GOAT
lets say:  europa/laliga/seriea = 1 pt pl/copa = 2 pt euro/ucl = 4 pt wc = 8 pt  minor trophies (nl, olympics etc.) can be tiebreaker   messi = 10 + 2 + 16 + 8 = 36 ronaldo = 4 + 6 + 24 + 0 = 34  imo as messi fan, ronaldo is still close enough to be in debate
Mark Ogden, your take on the times is dumb. Why not talk about how the level of football was much lower when Maradona played, tactically and quality wise? No disrespect but if Maradona played in today's time I doubt he does what Messi had done for 15 years
The most epic pulsating Grand Final in any sports the world has ever seen.  And it is befitting for Messi to be crowned The GOAT once and for all and for Argentina to be World Champion.   And special mention to Mbappe as well for part of the history as well.  And finally let's also salute all other players from both sides to play out their hearts for their countries to play out a high octane most nerving game from start to end.    And let's not forget how the crowd added to the tense and rapturous atmosphere.    Contras to Messi and Argentina.
Ogdens opinion went out the window when he mentioned Zidane & Zlatan them in the same conversation as actual goats, guy is literally just a hater.
It's amazing how when talking about Maradona people mention the tough tackles he received but nobody mentions the fact the cocaine is a performance enhancing substance.
Well said Mark Ogden!
first time watching world cup Messi is definitely the goat man he is leauge above Ronaldo i do not understand why people even compare Ronaldo to Messi its honestly an insult to Messi Ronaldo is overrated
THEY both played in the same league for 9 seasons. ON those 9 seasons: RONALDO -  1 MVP / 2 TITTLES. MESSI - 7 MVP / 6 TITTLES  Anyone who compares this guys must be really BLIND.
World cup is not the summit, CL is
To be honest everyone who has been watching football since 2000 or before knows this that goat debate is a useless discussion we (people of 2000 or before) know the importance of every position and players or every position and hence we see goat positions rather than a single greatest player and also it's our preference suppose if you like defending wouldn't maldini nesta ramos ferdinand puyol etc will be in your mind and will be in your YouTube searches more than messi Ronaldo won't you be calling them your favourites  So for it's rather our favourite players  I started watching football while idolising zizou but young Cristiano had a lot of my attention I can't describe my desire of supporting United when he was there but I was a madridista thanks to perez Ronaldo was brought here he then became my goat but still i don't think  he can do what zizou did tbh they are rather my pick for my favs also Ronaldo messi zizou etc are in my goat 11 team but even after ronaldo retires I'll follow a different player particularly alongside supporting Madrid  In this generation I'm pretty confused mbappe valverde vini bellingham musiala and even pedri playing with our rivals can't deny there talents can't choose simply
ESPN couldnt wait to write this headline 😂😭🤡 anything to talk down on Ronaldo lmaoooo
You can't compare messi with flopping player,
The craziest and greatest football match I've ever seen   Finally Argentina 🏆
Cronaldo, not even top 5.
'why do you have to put Ronaldo in this conversation ' The media wants to erase Ronaldo from history
The hatred Ale has for Cristiano Ronaldo, the face he gave was telling, like , the question he asked just showed it
Messi, one of the very greatest sportspersons, in history.
All both of them need was a world cup as so I have to say both messi n ronaldo are the greatest players of all time
Messi best football player in history!❤️😍 Hello from Ukraine 🇺🇦👋
If messi have to win the world cup this way then I'm happy being a Cristiano Ronaldo fan
messi is talented
Messi isnt the goat because that is just dumb lots of great players also mbappe 👏 won a wolrd cup young and almost won again(mbappe is great also and has had better success then messi) but the Argentinas stepped up not just messi . Maradona is much better and won two cups . Its just facts anyone who tries to argue that cant do math or understand logic.
Can’t be grateful enough for getting to watch Messi and Ronaldo man. Messi is the undisputed 🐐 now.
Honestly, the longetivity and the skills and the trophys he has Messi is way above everyone else ....
It's over Messi is the true GOAT everybody new that, he already has the World cup so the debate is over
110%Messi for me
Messi became my GOAT as soon as Ronaldo went to Piers Morgan.
here it goes GOAT espn fc not celebrating football but going at cr7  asap
Messi has been in Barcelona his entire career until recently,  he's always been surrounded by top tier players. Ronaldo has more Champions League goals he is also switch teams for different times. And all those four times Messi has always had better stronger teammates than Ronaldo has had
Ronaldo went from sitting on the bench at united to sitting on the bench at Portugal.
De debate for the best ever will never finish. But Messi was always better than C. Ronaldo and Im happy that that silly discussion is over
messi fan boy
messi fan boy
Messi is the best of his time but not from all history. That is not comparable and no one could determine that in the actual days. Pelo is the only player to have won 3 World cups and scored also in 1958's final when he was only 17 years old.
I think it’s also important to highlight that Messi and Ronaldo dominated for 15 years. Great players from past generations may have peaks similar to peaks of Messi and Ronaldo but their fire faded quickly. This is what pushes me to think that Messi is the GOAT.
LME looks like a squirrel
The players of the past deserve their respect for sure but Messi has broken most of if not all their records.   Messi is simply the best of all time.
One thing you should accept is that these 2 camps, Ronaldo and Messi, will never reconcile. Those who support Messi will always say Messi is the GOAT. Those who support Cristiano will always see him as the GOAT for all the records achieved and the heights he has reached which till now has not been reached yet. Let's leave it at that and put it to bed for once and for all
What a description by Ale.... Maradona and Messi just the GOATS of different eras
Ale moreno...respect...!
GOAT = Greatest Of All Time = PELE DISCUSSION OVER!
Unnecessary conversation 😒
GOAT DEBATE  ENDED
Mbappe was man of the match
Haaland is the GOAT. Won't play in the WC but is a better player than them all.
Where is Shaka ?
Are we forgot everyone kicking messi until 2015, he even has 2 scary injuries, he never fell easily to get fouls, he was & is greatest of all
Maradona is best ever
Pele..Messi...Maradona...three most complete footballers to play...magicians/genius...debate is over...
Reading through the comments, you can tell who only started watching football this century, and who has been watching far longer than that.
Just curious, for france first penalty, shouldnt the defender have been sent off  being the last defender denying a goalscoring chance?
6:19   I'm sorry to say mister but messi has suffered so much and if u had a heart for him u could have seen his heartbreaks after 2014 2015 2016 finals
Messi, Ronaldo9, Ronaldinho, Zidane, pirlo, Ronaldo7, Modric, Xavi, Iniesta, David villa, eto, Henry, Aguero, Gareth Bale, Neymar, Mbappe, Lampard, Gerrard, Beckham, Giggs, Scholes just to name a few could go on but what a selection of talent I have been blessed to have witnessed. Thanks for all the memories. Messi is my 🐐
Wat did we expect from ESPN
Why do you idolize Messi so much? What about the other players. Thats so stupid!!! Soccer is supposed to be a team sport. So why not put 1 person against another like in tennis? Because soccer is a skewed sport, only the shooters count. Ha ha, you have won the show of stupidity, not so? Congrats Argentina. So sorry soccer has become a single person indolized and corrupt sport 😩
Wc makes the difference but also the performances in the wc makes difference. Winning 4 consecutive motm and golden ball. With highest goal contribution is a joke
Messi mistake led to KM10 scoring the 2nd gol Germany)  2. Best team not to win WC Brasil 82 3. Best solo goal ever  Maradona 86 v England, Baggio 90 v Czech,  Owairan 94 v Belgium, Owen 98 v Argentina
Whether Messi won the World Cup or didn’t there was never a debate for me, but now the icing on the cake for all. He was in the conversation for GOAT at age 23 and now at 35 he still is. Lionel Messi you are immense, breathtaking and a work of art. I thank god for allowing me to witness such greatness.  Seeing you get what you always wanted will always bring a smile to my face.  Thank you.
cr7>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>messi ,maradona,pele,.....
Ronaldo and messi both are goat
This bunch of impotents literally earn their bread by criticizing Cristiano.
By accolades and trophies, Messi is the GOAT no doubt... But all these historical players didn't have the upbringing of Messi in Barcelona, and the nutrition programs and what not. It's pretty much rich kid advantage for Messi.... And many sports has GOATs in this era when you look at it. Just look at Tennis, what Djokovic, Nadal and Federer achieved in this new era.... Serena also.... Athletes become more superhuman as the time passes on....
Personally I don’t think Messi is the greatest of all time. There are times in his career where he has probably been the best player in the world but a lot of it over the years has just been hype to create money for his personal manager & team. The biggest issue is that he has never challenged himself in a competitive domestic league which helps to make him look like a God week in week out.  He has done well in the champions league though. Until this World Cup his record in the finals was pretty awful. A good ( and at times great) player…. Yes, the GOAT …. No.
Don't tell me Herndaz didn't scare of Messi 😁😁
*THANK YOU GOD FOR LETTING ME SEE GOAT MESSI*
Its less dangerous for an attacker but its much harder for an attacker cuz tactics and defences are more complex and physically defenders are in better shape
If World Cup decides the GOAT then pele has 3....You need a best team to win the world cup... Mbappe was on fire 🔥 in the finale but he lacked support... French forwards missed two open headers both on the assist of Mbappe... (Both those chances were last minute game closures.) French The lacked the team effort.... Argentina had Messi, de Maria, and the and the big wall the Martinez and others... French own the  last world cup, who is their GOAT... Germany before, that who was their GOAT...Many great players didn't win the World Cup... Portugal didn't get to final, it wasn't because of just Ronaldo... They didn't won any world cup, because the their team wasn't strongest.... Both Ronaldo and Messi are very different players... Messi is art of the da Vinci (the artist) Delicate, beautiful, where  as Ronaldo is the machine of the Edison ( the engineer), power, accuracy, destroyer.... Ronaldo can't do what Messi does and Messi can't do what Ronaldo does.... They are very different styles of play... Ronaldo has fans beyond the football playing nations. Ronaldo has the mindset which Every athlete should have. He can motivate even the dead man..... Ronaldo is the example of where hard work can get you, the place where Ronaldo started, his family background the poverty then playing for sporting Lisbon, at age 18 getting selected for Manchester, stayed there for like 6 years and then getting at Madrid. where as Messi arrived at Barca at 13 (one of the best clubs) getting the best of the facilities best of the players around, the exposure and stayed there for 20 years.... The starting le isn't the the same...they have very different personalities. I like Messi but personally for me Ronaldo is the GOAT 🐐, sadly Not every GOAT wins the world cup..
Let’s not kid ourselves. Had Messi be born in a country with a shitty national team, he wouldn’t have had win it. If CR7 was Brazilian, French, Spanish, Argentinian or whatever he’d have at least 1 WC too by now. Portugal is a much smaller country with no tradition in WC. Still, I’m very happy for Messi who’s a magician and the final was one of the best matches I’ve ever seen.  Some of the best players in the world could never win a WC because it’s a team sport. Making it a WC debate is just dumb. Basically only those born in a handful of countries would be in the discussion which is absurd.
Best world cup ever. Shame on racist BBC coverage and Lineker's commentating
It's already settled by 🐐Messi 🇦🇷 in some styles 🔥😘
Some many Dog fans pops out of anger ...if M  France or Portugal fans I ll be happy for the two penalties without which it would have been more controversial,cuz Argentina dominates for 79 min without any clear chances for France...
Marodana and messi respect all footbal player
Don't compare Messi to anyone  There are other great players and there's Messi
“Messi is the definition of football”
It settles who is better between messi and Ronaldo.. People now realise how big a world cup win is so maybe now they start thinking Pele is the king of kings.. Pele could easily have 4 world cups but dodgy refs in 66 denied him that.
What joke! The disrespect is unbelievable! Worst pundits out there
Ronaldo isn't even the best Portuguese player of all-time, let alone, the GOAT.
The way espn has been knocking cr7 ,now they can rest. Of course just a little "We respect what ronaldo has done"
Ronaldo is better than Messi
The goat is MARADONA everyone else is behind him.   Maradona   Messi Pele  CR7 Zidane
That's one salty baldy
Messi doesn’t eclipse Ronaldo, they both have two different styles of playing. Messi does what he does and so does Ronaldo
Oh yes a corrupt one month tourney decides the debate. Where Argentina penalty their way to the cup. Ronaldo is 37 years old. This Messi Ronaldo fanboy debate is one stupid childish debate.
Mbappé did in one night something that Messi couldn’t do in 20 years. Debate is not even started… now let’s watch mbappe carry Messi and Neymar with PSG.
The France come back was phenomenal. That was the game changer
Messi worked hard to get to this status. Another legend to look out for is mbappe well played a phenomenal match but unfortunately there has to be one winner.
Messi was always the G.O.A.T and will be for the foreseeable future.
a world cup doesnt make you a goat......Ronaldo is still the main goat
Leo Messi is the greatest player in the history of world football🐐
Espn’s love for Ronaldo
I will continue to say it, CR7 to me is still the GOAT. Statistically CR7 did it in the highest levels, where Messi has been save in the leagues he played on.  1. CR7 2. Messi   That’s my top 2 of all time
What has Ronaldo done at World Cup? So there is no question
Ale Moreno is the GOAT 🐐🐐🐐😂
And Messi was playing with an Arm stream right from the Netherland game but still delivered He's the best
Messi has clearly taken his team to this glory, he deserves all the love, he has done a lot for this game of football to be called one of the greatest players on this planet who have ever played. But after all this, there is one man on this earth who can sit on the same table, and can say he is the best. You can call messi, goat if you want. But that will take nothing away from Cristiano. For the upcoming generations, Whenever you talk about messi you have to talk about Cristiano.
You can tell some muppets are hating on CR7,but there are great news also because isn’t CR7’s wife from Argentina? So,I am sure he is happy for his wife.
The pundits r extremely happy. Their pr works finally paid off.
Really messi was not kicked? Did you watch El clasico at all? Messi got his mouth bleeding in many occasions And also have the whole Madrid difference fouling him Plz check
The debate has been long over, but this trophy confirms and solidifies it!
Get this women back to the kitchen
This Ogden is a fool😂😂😂, Messi had always been kicked round the pitch from his early days because that was literally the only way to stop him!. Then he earned opposition respect for never complaining and always getting up to continue the game.
Thank you mark
In all my years of football ( im 50 years of age ) ...i have NEVER seen a world cup final match so dramatic as this one between France & Argentina....Both of these 2 teams gave absolutely everything on the pitch ( escpecially within the last 20 minutes) ...but in the end , destiny has its own pre- written completed script ...And according to that script , Argentina was supposed to be the final winners ...Congratulations to Argentina ....and France ...You made it worth our  watch ...wow !!!!!!  Messi is and was the best footballer to me , looooooong before this world cup trophy ..
So according to these guys, whole squad of a world winning team is GOAT.A single trophy decides who is Goat D Maria the goat L.Martinez the goat Acuna the goat Rodríguez the goat  Messi the 🐐,and so on
The “GOAT” got free penalties during the whole tournament, and he is allowed to use his hands 😂😂 true not everybody can do that 😂
Whoever saying ... Messi was not kicked is not seeing the football i'm seeing.  Messi literally bleed many times in football pitch. There is a video called "Messi is a Dogman" . Watch it and say to my face ... that messi was not brutally fouled.  Messi has the longest carrier at the highest level, that is why people may be suffering from Memory Loss. How Messi played in his prime. You are comparing Prime Maradona and Prime Pele with Current Messi at 35.   MESSI is the GOAT. No Question No Argument. Forget about all the cups and prizes. Just say if nobody won any cup, just form the playstyle itself Messi is Miles Ahead of everyone else.
No.
I fell in love with football by watching Cristiano Ronaldo, and you can’t take that away. But Messi is the GOAT 🐐
Fifa Refrees are the real Goat
Messi Haters can rest in peace now... 😂
Sorry Messi but Brazilian Ronaldo aka fenomeno is still the best player ever
I think it's not Greatest Of All Time but rather Greatest On A Time. Football has been easy going at the current gen, but would MESSI or Christiano survive in number of gen that had Rivaldo, Rcarlos, Ronaldo9, Zidane, Maldini, Gattuso, Del Piero, Maradona, Bergkamp, Henry, Cantona, Best..etc remains a doubt. Modern footballers are pampered and way too much protected, and easy penalties are everywhere. So much drama where modern players keep whine for any simple contact etc. But I'm happy that Messi finally can be at peace. But sadly it's all over.
This is one of those moments that u will never be able to forget in u r lifetime. Messi is truly the goat. He has won everything out there that is football. A massive weight has been lifted off his shoulder. He is the best that I have seen in my lifetime. World Champion finally.
35 years old, Messi has never had a Peak !!! He is the Peak !
This goat debate is just getting too stupid now
Cristiano CR7 numbers are insane still the number one.
Salty Moreno🤣🤣🤣
Nature will still award CR7 a world cup before he retires. It's Messi's time. Ronaldo's time will come in 2026.He won't retire from Portugal. He will still fight on.
As a Ronaldo fan it hurts to write this but the goat debate is well and truly over. I always knew Messi was more skilled but they were somewhat comparable in terms of their trophy/achievements. Especially around 2018 Ronaldo had a genuine case for being considered better than Messi. After last night its not even a debate anymore. Messi is in the realm of Pele/Maradona, possibly even better than those two. Ronaldo will forever be my favorite player but it hurts to think that he will become an afterthought instead of an all time great.
Who is this Guy Ale, does he even know the game Football, He asks is the channel have any contract to popup Ronaldo's name, this shows he is not aware of what football is in the last 15 years. He just needs to Shut his mouth if he has any grudge against CR7. CR7 is the best footballer with Messi who has ever played this game. Both are GOAT in their own ways. @ESPN please educate this guy
The debate of Messi v Ronaldo is finished. We all know who the GOAT is
as a cr7 fan im happy he won it,would have been heartbreaking to see messi lose yet so close
M e s s i ❤
Pele is by far the goat
This is the power of dream and hard work ladies and gentleman, messi never stop believe.
Mbape hahaht till 78 minute where is mbappe
Messi GOAT 🐐
Ronaldos performance at this world cup doesn't detract from his greatness at all.
obviously messi as all around player
Now every penaldo fans will say pele is the goat,,what an unfaithful fans hahahaha
Pele is the GOAT and that's that. Messi is in the conversation but what Pele did for football is different, all these new gen wouldn't be anything without him.
Ronaldo is lucky to have been in this conversation in the first palce.
Messi is not goat footballer. Messi is the goat athlete.
Moreno on point about the need to discuss Ronaldo when there is no need too.  The last fee months has taken Messi to a new level and that's not just on the pitch. Ronaldo has been immense and has earned his place as one fo the greats but he has also tarnished his legacy in recent times. Too much drama , family all fighting his battles and bring disrespectful.  It's ok if some one is better than you.  Look at the way Federer speaks about Rafa and Novak. Always respect.  Ronaldo has Piers Morgan also fighting his battles.
this was a debate only in ronaldo fans' mind...for everyone else, messi was a clear winner and by great margin...CR7 is incredible player, but messi in in his own league...
Pele is the king of football. France was cheated. The game should have not went into overtime. Late in the game there was 2 fouls committed in favor of France and the white referee didn’t called the fouls, and they also didn’t show the replay of those 2 fouls. Pele won 3 would cups.
Argentina was already there while Cr7 introduced Portugal to football history. U can't just compare them by the cup they achieved, just think if cr7 played for Argentina and Messi for Portugal, how will u judge
Women talking about Football.....uh she thinks she know better football than players ......women 🙄
Where is shaka
PESSSIIIIIII🤡
What is the last guy talking about
Messi is magical. With or without a world cup. Now he has one just to silence the haters. Hail King Leo
Nice, now people will forget CR7 !
THAT save from Emi Martinez to deny Kolo Muani at the end of extra time and the Lautaro Martinez missed header in the space of 30 seconds had me at the edge of my seat.
If it was ridiculous to compare the greatest players in the history with Cristiano b4 winning the World Cup imagine now? There’s a reason why Pele himself didn’t want to see him winning…Dios numbers are all documented and they all speak for themselves. He never cheated and claimed scoring 1000 goals including those scored plying with his little friends in the neighborhood 😅😂🤣
We don't need to end this debate Messi and Ronaldo will be there for all who all love football
Moreno hates Ronaldo period
Greatest game of all time.but Goat 🐐 as far as I have seen r9 at his peak and Madonna are still the best I have ever seen in my lifetime. But yes statistically Messi is the best of all time without a doubt surpassing even Pele
Messi >> rono >> everyone
Mark has the best answer... that was a brilliant answer
When they give you penalties hard to loose this is a a fake championship!!
CR and Mpappe  are the reason make me to watch football . Only World Cup
Mbappe vs Argentina
in my Opinion difference is ,Ronaldo depends on  the manager to deliver him  a good team, Messi as senior player carries his teams on his shoulders.
Mark Ogden: tell me you haven't seen much Messi without telling me you haven't seen much Messi.  Go and watch highlights of Messi where the only way to stop him is rugby tackling him. It's not been a debate for a few years, now. Messi is the best there has ever been. For me, Maradona is second. It's not disrespectful.
Next world for cr7 the real 🐐
Both are best they make each other best
Pele
Koman really was good
The goat is Ronaldo always
Ale understand football better
I don't understand why it's about CR7 against Messi meanwhile it should have been Mbappe against Messi.
I don't believe a world cup trophy defines who is the goat, or who's the greatest of this generation... there's plenty of average players with a world cup to their name. That said, I'm happy Messi now has one as I've always said he's the goat and it should hopefully quieten down those obsessed with Ronaldo.
What are you talking about? That man retired from Argentina twice.
My whole family lost their voice after celebrating Argentina victory! No one can speak today properly 🤣 Thank you Messi!
What a game that was messi well deserved
Thats exactly why wc was sold to Qatar-Khelaifi Co.
Goat debate being discussed by people who don’t even play football. Both Ronaldo and messi are greatest of all time. Congratulations messsi and Argentina 🇦🇷
Pele conquered 3 world cups, still he is not GOAT..... Add some iodized salt in your food
Messi was already superior to the guy from Portugal😃 Messi is the G.O.A.T.🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Ronaldo must be sick right now 😳
Lionel messi got 5 man of the match 🐐🐐🐐
can you please stop this masturbation about messi? if the last french shot have been inside you would have say that messi is the worst loser.
No no mbappe was nothing he is just a goal scorer but not a good player
Imagine Ronaldo have Argentine team, this is not supposed to be which player is better, it is supposed to be which player have a better team.
no didn’t like or respect RONALDO from he till he ending his career none of never like
Cause his the best cr7
When FIFA itself is helping you definitely you're gonna win it.
Papa! Look somebody making sense on espn. Thank you! There's no goat. Every body era is different.👏👏👊💯
Cr7 is real goat
Mbappe is the  goat
Fake media pandit’s jealous about Cristiano…
Messi was crowned by the Sheikh to go down in history as the football Sheikh
One penalty in every single game for Argentina, it was so rigged, but wtv. I still think this doesn't settle anything for good between cr7 and m10 but both are the best players to ever play the game we all love
Ale's first take was so relatable. You grow up witnessing greatness, but then living to see someone surpass past greatness, and openly appreciate it.
It's funny how people discuss whether Messi or Ronaldo is the goat from the comfort of our coaches. Most of us can't last 90minutes on a soccer pitch with a slow jog, but we want to rate other people 😅  The spectator life
All you white and Hispanic people NEVER mention Pele as greatest of all time. You are FAKE journalists. Real sports pundits are not biased or prejudice
RoboCop 🎥 2022
Mark Ogden you are a true football personnel you explained everything accurate with precise judgement.
It is over from roots.  Messi is the best footballer . He is a complete football player. Simply the Best. Kudos to Mbappe! What a player he is turning into... His maturity in this world cup was probably the last piece in the puzzle!  A mature Mbappe is most dangerous player currently.
Wow, CR was barely mentioned in the conversation. The only thing he has to make his case as GOAT is the number of UCL goals and international goals he scored. But if you take UCL goals then in effect you are basically saying only players that play in Europe should be eligible as GOAT. Pele would definitely be out for one. If you base his claim for GOAT on international goals scored, then I would ask why the past record holders of highest number of international goals before CR were never conversation as GOAT? Players like Ali Daei, Mokhtar etc. Is because they didn't play much against European teams? Then you get the Eurocentric yard stick again.
This isnt ridiculous. Ronaldo's whole career was all about beating the little magician from argentina on all levels with hard work. But he finally hit the road block this world cup. With his all drama interview just before the wc, the debate took the wrong turn for him. And the writing was on the walls for him and messi.  Where messi was preparing himself for the wc, ronaldo was busy managing his image on the world stage. Thats exactly what a GOAT would never do. They are being considered goats for what they do on the pitch not off it. Messi needn't answer any such crazy debates. He wanted to win the wc for his country, for the legacy he had taken over from their country's god. Ronaldo was trying to prove to the world that he is the greatest of all.  He is indeed the best goal scorer all of time. But Messi is the greatest of all time footballer.
Only Argentina is blessed to have both the GOD and the GOAT of football❗️ Maradona & Messi‼️ RESPECT from Indonesia 🇮🇩
The only ones more upset than France fans are:  1. Portugal fans 2. Man Utd fans 3. Real Madrid fans
Pele has 3 now messi just needs 3 more to beat him
What a game no finals were ever like this loved it
Mbappe. This kid have brilliant future. Argentina is predestined to win it. They have sheer of lucks, always get penalties too. I put my bet on Argentina. Just like Chelsea win the champion league. Rofl
It’s really hard for me to hold on to my opinion. If CR7 won he would have been greatest. Unfortunately many great heroes fall with time and in this case CR7 is second best in this generation.
Congratulations Argentina on winning the World Cup ! Great team effort. Kudos to Qatar for being great hosts
His 8th bolon dor on the way.I wanna see many likes man.
I think its still too close to call for the fact its still a topic for discussion and debate so its still down to personal preference at the end of the day. I don't think there's anything else the two of them can do to swing the pendulum to their favors.  So personally my choice for the GOAT is still CR7 but I'm very happy for Messi to win the WC
Messi is the best player of all time ❤️👍
Cristiano Ronaldo is the best
Cheers for Messi and a fantastic career. But Mbappe was the best player in the pitch that night. One can really make a difference with him  dragging France to a shootout from 2-0 and scoring an incredible treble in the Finals. Talking of GOAT Mbappe is only in his early 20s and already a legend. But destiny and Messi had other plans ..
Messi Messi Messi Ankarra Messi Ankarra Messi Ankarra Messi 2 3 4 Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful
Anti Ronaldo they can have tins to say for the whole week
Rolando of Portugal is far behind from Messi ,Ronaldinho Rolando of Brazil..and marodona
Messi just became Immortal in the history of football. From now on people will not only say "Pele and Maradona." They'll say "Pele, Maradona and Messi." Messi the GOAT. 👑⚽
Portugal before Ronaldo  World cup - 0  Euro -0 After Ronaldo  World Cup -0 Euro - 1 Nations League -1 Argentina Before Messi  World cup - 2 wins( 4 Finals) Cops America - 14 wins After Messi   World cup - 3 wins (6 Finals) Copa America - 15 wins Argentina is great before Messi and now Messi justified it Portugal is just another team but Ronaldo made it Good team. Both are GOATS
Rubbish u guys should go and give him  ballon Dio  Ronaldo still the best
ESPN true Ronaldo haters
Kylian was unstoppable.. No one even came near him... Not even so called messi.
portuguese population 10 million, argentina 50 million, portugal never had a chance at world cup, so goat discussion cant be based on world cup, bc small country never won world cup
Out of context Neymar got kicked heavy
Those using the world Cup to judge are simply stupid,
Best game ever. Messi and Eusébio best all time. Ronaldo not even was better that Eusébio in world cups
There's no other player that can do what Lio did and do for this game. GOAT. And that's it.
Pele is the goat, no debate
Rest In Peace Maradona the legend
I'm ronaldo fan but even I can not deny that Messi is the goat now
The media doesn’t decide who the goat is. Messi was good but he took 5 penalties this WC. Mbappe was the best player in the  WC. And as much as I like Messi too, Pele is the still the goat despite everyone trying to act like he didn’t win 3 WCs and scored as many goals as Messi and CR7.
Tbh, the Messi-Ronaldo debate will never end lol.   Messi won the World Cup now, and he deserves it. Messi also came from a country that has World Cup history, and it was a journey and a title he needed (even though in my opinon, he never needed it). Portugal meanwhile does not have that history, their best result was 3rd, and Portugal finished 4th in 2006 (with Ronaldo).   Now that said, the World Cup is important, and if you are the best you should be in the conversation to win it.   But if Messi and Ronaldo played for Trinidad and Tobago, despite all the UCLs, and Balon Dors, would we say they are not the best in the world, if they never won a World Cup?  Now, if they did win it with Trinidad and Tobago, then they are the best XD. But Argentina being with the history, required Messi to win. Portugal, kinda didn't need Ronaldo to win it, since he doesn't have a Maradona to compete against.   The argument I will raise, is that in 2016 Ronaldo won the Euros with a team that was not that great, but they should have been better in the 2018 World Cup, should have been super powers in Euro 2020s, and in 2022, they had a freaking great team. I just think management was their main issue.   Ronaldo however did not win the World Cup, but I don't think that means he isn't the best. Messi is the best, but not because he won a world cup.
Ronaldo is my absolute favorite but gotta say Messi is the GOAT. It's really sad it's almost come to an end 😭
BuT hOw DoEs tHis aFfEcT LeBrOn's lEgAcY
Mbappe vs Haaland Norway vs France 2030 fifa World Cup final In USA. Them two taking over
Messi > mbape> ramos> cr End of debate🤣👌
Messi player of the tournament with 5 penalties 😂😂😂
Messi is great. Pele is the greatest.
A bunch of messi fanboys discussing who's the goat 🤣🤣 there's no goat in football every player has different circumstances and conditions in their respective careers and the context is always different for every player.
This debate is actually very well balanced and covers different perspectives. Sort of some really deep thoughtful moments there.
Ronaldo still the GOAT .. conquered every league and still the best ever
Saudi Arabia > Argentina
Thanks Mark, wise analysis
Ronaldo fan here but Messi had already established himself is the better of the two. This just cements his legacy as the ALLTIME GOAT
Goat of the goats💯
Messi was always great since age of 19  Since 2007 he challenge greats and greats of futbol Fact he won three ballndor in a row in 2009 to 2011 put him in greatest in history already then in 2011  He was only 23  Fast forward 10 years  He just put extra big trophies in his accolades Which is world up That summit his legacy as greatest player to do in game of football ⚽ He achieved everything as of 2022  He has nothing else to prove He can retire if he wants!!
Now since messi won the world cup nobody gonna see facts. Ronaldo came from country with no history while Argentina  has already won the world cup and  of course who can forget the great Maradona. Ronaldo carried own his own put Portugal on the map with greatest fifa teams. Plz tell what are the portugal achievements before Ronaldo came? My love increased for Ronaldo coz the level of hate he receive from officials and media still managed to win and achieved so many things is something phenom. He is always hungry for goals to win to be on top level. Keep trolling him he is the reason these media people and so many  earns money and run there homes. One decline in his life in term of his form and his personal life  people trying to forget everything thts the level of hate Ronaldo deals with. For me both are GOATS 🐐🐐 But Ronaldo is was n always the greatest player of all time stepped on the pitch nobody can write that off. Ronaldo messi GOATS
Maradona is the greatest since he was both Messi and Ronaldo at same time. Last year in Farmers league he was no were to be seen. He need his teammates to work for him. I think both are greats of all time. Cr7 winning Euro wasn't easy. I like Cr7 bse he is versatile he can change game with long range shorts, head, and also at the penalty spot. He can come back just like he did against Spain but if France scored first it would have different story. It's seen in UCL against Liverpool, Roma how Messi just fades away.even this match when France got back he wasn't there just got lucky with the 3 Rd goal. Ronaldo also played in 3 different leagues and done great while Messi is no were best in France.
1:01 Ronaldo fans response....i feel your pain bro... 😂 Congratulations to Messi                         - a cr7 fan
Ronaldo always 🐐⚽
Messi is the GOAT.
If they'd lost the penalty shootout, would he not be the GOAT then?  How stupid.  Messi and Ronaldo are both all time greats, let's move on.
There is a major diffrence between CR7 and Messi. CR7 plays with Ego. Messi Plays with Spirit.
Messi is the man. But leaving Pele out of the goat discussion is ridiculous. This  vid loses all credibility because of the title alone.
This outcome was destined in the stars. If France would have scored 20 goals, Argentina would have met their 20 and it would have gone to penalties. Inevitable. We witnessed something otherworldly. Today proved 2 things: football is just and football rewards the faithful.
How can be a debate when Ronaldo was always on the bench and Messi won a WC final LOL
0:34 Never knew KANE had such good insights in football..
I've got  Zidane and Maradona, ahead of CR7 and if it wasn't for all the injuries the Brazilian Ronaldo as well forget Messi who is at the top by himself
I attain Inner Peace ✌️ 😌
How can one say Messi is the best player ever???  Messi is one of the greatest but not the best player ever.  Both Pele and Maradona won up to two FIFA senior Men's National team World Cup.  Messi just won his first FIFA senior Men's National team World Cup.  Mbappe won it back in year 2018.  Peace.
Leo Messi The GOAT
Last time i checked, most people debated that messi = ronaldo. They never acknowledge that messi is the GOAT regardless of his accomplishment. They say that Messi is not the GOAT unless he wins the WC. So as a fan, it’s a good debate. I don’t have a problem with that.   Then now, after he won it, all the people i know didn’t even recognize it again. They all have the necessary reason why Messi is not the GOAT. Hypocrisy at it’s finest. I don’t know what to say anymore😆
Its finished man, before you talk on who is goat, will ask you what goat is? And what is difference between goat and your favorite one? Its obvious now who is the best one, based their impact on their team and what he achieved. No need debate anymore😂
Leo messi has the unnatural talent no doubt he’s the goat he’s a freak but do respect Cristiano Ronaldo. His mentality, his perseverance, his hardwork rate that he competed with such unnatural talent for so many years and sometimes beating it too. Cristiano is also the goat. We are such a lucky generation to witness both the goats🐐🐐
With the age of 35, he still won the The Golden Ball and WC Thropy, with incredible score..5 time MOTM award.. This is wow!!! He win the Cup with his capability, not depent on his team mate but he bring his team to win the Cup.. He is better than cr7, Maradona and event pele.. He is the Real GOAT!!!
Di Maria was cooking down that left hand side! If he would have played the second half the game would have been put away.
Messi eclipsed CR7 long before this World Cup even started. This World Cup only supplements his legacy. It doesn't define it.
78 minutes of torrid football from the French, admittedly a depleted French squad... Kante MAKES them imho.  Lucky to get E.T. but it sure made for a spectacle and those last 30mins were mind blowing!  Just glad the best team with the most amazing fans won!  In terms of Messi vs Ronaldo.... on paper theres little in it.  Watching them on the pitch though???  Messi is waaaay beyond Ronaldo as a baller.  Ronaldo compensated for his lower ability by working on himself at a level no other footballer has been willing to go to, reachinf new levels of self confidence (and arrogance) and thats his legacy but his legacy is one of selfishness, dislikable character traits and teams/other individuals sacrificing themselves for him even if to win together.  Messi isnt a total saint but he is a far better role model  far better character  and a far better footballer in pure ability terms.  Near 20 years of absolute footballing joy and impossible to dislike the guy to boot.  Ronaldo, hmm not so much.
Lionel Messi is absolutely the greatest player in the history of Soccer
The debate was already over penaldo dogs kept barking
Did Ronaldo already congratulate Messi?
Iwonder how the name of Ronaldo came in this topic ,can't you write without mantioning him? Boring.
No more crynaldo vs messi debate please
Every team member from Emi Martinez to Otamendi to MacAlister to Di Maria to Alvarez to Messi came through like a warrior.
What i see in this wc,all the world was against mbappe,uk,morocco,argentina...don´t worry people next world cup france will be there and maybe argentina will be there but with no messi...and france will be there for sure.
4 penalty is a goat lololol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂Moreno should move on as a personal taste looossseeerrrrrr all it need is Portugal coach to bench CR7 because he is probably paid by fifa to do so
I can’t believe  I was alive to see Messi become world champion the goat no doubt
Mark is talking thrash. The stats of Messi confirms he is the G.O.A.T.
One obvious question is "Who is the best ever Basketballer, Boxer, Tennis and Baseball players of all time." Guess what, you can define that person. This excuse of not respecting other players is nonsense. Leonel Andres Messi statistically, beautifully, elegantly, flamboyantly and skillful is the Greatest Footballer and Male Athlete of ALL TIME.
Mbappe scored 3 in the final.HATTRICKKKKK. Don’t forget
Benz was truly missed this World Cup
Mbappe really wanted to break my heart today, but God was on our side. Mbappe is the talent of the future to be honest
They forgot to give credit to Ronaldo from Brazil, 3x FIFA player of the year winner. He was no less than anyone despite so many injuries.
What I think is so funny is that Messi and Cr7 aren't sitting around wondering which is better, at the end they are both great and now there is a whole new generation coming along who could break their records and do things new and amazing that are going to wow people. Just let them enjoy themselves, Messi accomplished a huge goal and now he is at peace.
This is the best game. Soccer has captured my heart and the hearts of my family. Thank you to all the teams and players for a tremendous World Cup.
GOATS win championships. In football, that's the World Cup. Messi and Mbappé each have one and one runner-up. Mbappé was the Best Young Player in 2018, Second Best this time. Mbappé is the "top goalscorer of all time in World Cup final." He scored more goals than Messi in both recent World Cups, 4-1, 8-7.  Messi set the record for most games played at 27. Mbappé played in 14 and he's only 23.  Mbappé "became the second player to score a hat-trick in a men's World Cup final, following Geoff Hurst for England in 1966. Having also scored once in the previous final, Mbappé became the  highest-scoring player in the final of the World Cup with four goals, surpassing the three of Hurst, Pelé,  Vavá and Zinedine Zidane."  Messi is done. Great career. Given France's quality, I'd expect there's a good chance Mbappé will get more bites at the apple.
Im sorry yes Mbappe delivered a hat trick but that was a horrible game for him and France. They beat the back line once in about 82 minutes. If not for the horrible Argentinian plays on defense game would of been over.
You're  pushing a false narrative. Get of your derierre and look at some archive footage as to why 'El Rey" Pele STILL surpasses Maradona and Messi. As much as you want to install Messi to the highest heights the facts are there for millions of TRUE football connoisseurs to see...
Was there a debate?
For me Martinez is the hero of the match,but unfortunately no one talking about him. Savior of Argentina.
Real Madrid fan of 24 years here. The first time I watched him in a classico in 2007, I knew he was going to be the G.O.A.T. I thank Messi for giving us joy and 5 champions league titles. Messi challenged and improved Madrid to new heights  even when he was our greatest rival.
he was always the goat, ronaldo fanboys always had to come up with stupid reasons why ronaldo is better "ronaldo is a better goalscorer"- messi has a better goals per game average "messi has only done it in spain" messi vs epls top 6; 27 goals in 36 games  keep coping
The thing that’s annoying and stupid is Messi never got criticism, nobody ever talked bad about him EVER! He didn’t even get blamed for the loss to Saudi Arabia. Stop trying to create haters and stuff for Messi that didn’t exist. Nobody in the football world did anything other than praise Messi, there was not criticism or pain to come back to.
It’s like cats and dogs we all have opinions what we prefer pros and cons but me and for ever will be cristiano Ronaldo with or with out World Cup I still believe Ronaldo is the best player in the world for me  but congratulations Messi you made your fans proud and happy 🎉
Every body got who they love end of the story
White dude trippin, Messi the goat goat
Congrats to Messi and Argentina... vamos for late Diego Maradona...
Can’t wait to see Stephen a debate and turn this into lebron v Messi
As Ronaldo fan, I admit that Messi is the Best player in The Universe, now please Stop Criticized Ronaldo 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Mark, you are not up to it
Mark Ogden a penaldo fan.. hater
Messi is the Goat. No debate anymore
Messi and Brazilian Ronaldo best players
Mark is right, Messi isn’t the best player to play the game, we can’t just say that there has to be some criteria to determine that between past and present. He’s simply the best of his generation in terms of trophies.
The GOAT debate is over
Johan Cruijff
For professional soccer player, winning the World Cup for your country is the number one dream/goal.
Nothing new here ..but Messi was phenomenon this WC but CR7 is still the GOAT.
Football goat debate is more realistic than NBA goat debate since the player play in the same era and play against each other
Messi always was the greatest of his era, but this cements him as the greatest of all time.
CR7 is the GOAT. Messi, Maradona and  Pele come from large powerhouse nations which were winning before, during and after their eras. CR7 helped inspire Portugal to something never ever been done in their history
Agree with mark
What an amazing game and Grats to Messi and Argentina but it doesn't change my GOAT list in the least. I still have Pele #1, C Ronaldo #2 and Messi #3.
Totally agree with Ale
Real life movie script 😃😃
Go back and check Maradona videos u guys are babies
i bet you doggy cr7's family will cry again that he don't have the teammates as messi
From the day Argentina lost to Saudi Arabia in their opening game to win the final against defending world champion France, there's no way you could have think of it, Messi surpass every obstacle & challenge, he deserved all of this
now that messi has the holy grail we should give credit to others becos cr7 has nothing? common let a dog have a day.
I present the GOAT  . Messi
This is true, I think it's a matter of taste.    For the last 20 years, I always had 4 players on my favorite list, and they are...    #1 Pele,  #2 Maradona,  #3 G. Hagi    #4 C. Valderama  Not to say those guys are the best, but they're just my personal favorites.
Cristiano who?
Cristiano is my favorite player ever but you cannot deny Messi is the goat 🐐
He isn't the GOAT... Winning a world cup doesn't make you the GOAT.  Only big nations and strong teams are winning the World Cup. PELE won 3 times but still many people believe Maradona is the GOAT. You can't expect Lewandowski with Poland or Haaland with Norway, Zlatan with Sweden or Even Ronaldo with Portugal to win world cup. If you look at the history, it's always in between 2 big Latin American teams and big European countries like France, Italy,  Spain and Germany with best teams. Messi has 2 great assists but most of goals are by penalties which was awarded to him so cheaply and it clearly shows the favorism by referee in all his career. Someone just touch him and it's a foul or yellow card and he can make fouls or handball but no booking for him......FIFA is corrupt
Emi Martinez is my Argentine player of the tournament.  He was trumps everytime they needed him.
Pele and Maradonna was better than Messi, but give jack his jacket, Leo Messi legendary
Penaldo isn’t in the goat debate 😂😂😂
Ogden doesn't half talk a load of nonsense. Messi IS the greatest player in the sport of all time and it's not disrespectful to other generational talents to say it. He might be 1% better than Maradona, but given how high that bar is set that 1% difference means a lot. And does Messi benefit from not taking the same lumps as yesteryear's greats? Only if you don't take into account the pace of today's game, the use of data and statistics to prepare, and the higher levels of defensive organization and superior tactical setups. Just because opponents aren't kicking pounds of flesh off of him doesn't mean the pitch is wide-open to him, either. What a foolish and naive take Mark offered.
Messi 7ballon dors and 8th loading plus the world cup. Messi is the best Footballer ever better than Pele and maradona
The only way to determine whether who the best player is is after the player has retired or not around. A player's off the field  conduct is also important. For eg, nothing could match Maradona skill, but he is not a good coach and is addicted to. drugs. His last WC game which he scored a superb goal was tainted by a drug test which was positive and was suspended. Lionel Messi last WC game ( yesterday) was one of the most memorable moments that one could achieve.
Aided by the refs throughout his career, never stepped out of the comfort zone, had to play copa America every other year just to have an international trophy to his name. Qatar's sportswashing project fetched him a WC medal but sure he is the GoAT. Quite literally the definition of overrated.
G. O. A. T   Messi  team Player Ronaldo team Scorer  Both of them are legends in this sport. One win less then other, but doesn't matter.  At the ending career in football, the way how they prepare for matches and training, is fantastic...  A lot of people sayd about PELE, but we cannot compare that period with this one...  He win 3 world cup, and score 1200 goals, and for this he still last century best player.  The football from that period was easy, not to much tehnical prepare, players was not trained well, no conditions...and to score a goal in that time was easy then is now when every single player have all facilities and training at highest level....  But now to score more then 750 - 800 goals in all competitions it's say something....  The big names in football history have around 300 - 400 goals...  So i consider that's G. O. A. T goes to Lionel Andres Messi.  second- Ronaldo  Third -Pele.  Fourth-Maradona
If this was a movie, CR7 would surely go down in history as one of the greatest villains in cinema history. Everyone loves a good villain, and he delivered his line to perfection. And so did Messi. What a story!! A man who was delusional and confident enough to challenge a god, and through pure hard work and dedication he did exactly that, right until the end, when the inevitable fairy tale ending happen.  Without a proper rival, his career wouldn't have been as exciting and entertaining as it turned out to be. CR7 should be proud of the countless battles he won, but it was Messi who won the war and the GOAT debate. Truly the best ever!!
Football is falling off when messi and ronaldo retire, it will take 100 years before we see another one who has the potential to rival
Messi is the best. The most accomplished.
There both the goats
Too much hate to ESPN for my life time
They are all Messi fans but I will always pick cr7 over anyone
Here to unlike the video laterss
What a stupid argument.  Argentina has been a powerhouse in world football for the past century.  Portugal have been an average european team with 1 or 2 stars for the past half a century.  The likelihood for Portugal winning a WC have always been slim to none as football is still a team game.  Messi and CR have both changed the game and played at an unreal level for the past 20 years.  To suggest CR now passed by Messi is just dumb.
case closed...THE GOAT IS MESSI
Today I declare that MESSI is the 👑KING👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑👑 of FOOTBALL⚽
funny how the goat debate is only about offensive players.. i know its hard to define the other positions but it could just be a defender.
ale spittin about ronaldo
Pelé is all time Goat. Messi and Maradona comes next. CR7 ia among top 10. Simple. Let’s not be prisioners of the moment.
Stop worshiping players this god that god.. they’re all really good soccer players stop worshiping
The oldest player in world🏆⚽ to score more goals,  assist,  dribbling and etc   NO MORE WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT🙏
Messi ❤️🔥
France didn't take over, Ale. Argentina gave them the game when they subbed DiMaria and went in defense
I agree with Mark 100%
Forget that...cr7 is better
This final will go down as my favorite so far what a game, and yes no need for comparison Messi is one of the greatest of his generation, flowers to Enzo, Mac Allister de Paul, manzola j. Alvarez must move away from city baydaway his to good to be onde the bench.🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Maradona didn't have all the criticism and pressure during his time like Messi did. if they were waiting for Messi to win the WC, to say he is better than Maradona or the best ever......now there is no more excuses
Dam that first dude answering is a 🤡
oh come on this is proximity bias at it's best, and pleasing viewers - Messi is the greatest current player , but Maradona, Pele, and Ronaldo (Brazilian) at his peak were just as good - so is CR7 (at his best) and Mbappe currently
Love Griezman for his respect to leo
He didn’t need it to be considered the GOAT, Ronaldo needed it to be on par.  Now that Messi’s finally won it, he has pulled further ahead, and for them being at their twilight years of their careers, Ronaldo will never ever chase him.
Martinez, mcalister, di maria and the GOAT messi outstanding.
F1lthy khazar z
Honestly this GOAT thing is over-rated, there were great players before Messi and there will be others after him. CR has played in different leagues, different countries adapting to different contextual realities and still perform at a high level - that must count for something. Many great players have never won a WC but, that does not mean they are not great. Messi might have been a great influence but, no single player wins a football game  - give credit to the Argentinian team. Emi Martinez was outstanding throughout the tournament!
Most rigged WC
I've been a Barcelona fan since 99, seen just about every game since 2004 and I can say 100% that Messi was kicked all over the pitch his entire career.   You can make your emotional arguments, but Messi has the most trophies and has done the most most alien things on the pitch.  Shout Out to Emmi Martinez. Since he showed up, Argentina wins trophies. They were playing 4th choice keepers before him, and he has won pks in both copa and world cup.
Lionel Messi cannot be the greatest player in the game because there exist this guy called Pele who single handedly revolutionised the game starting at the age of 17 when the world hit to know his name and he won his first of World cups, not because it was easy other wise others would have done it, but because you have to be as good as Pele to achieve it or better and nobody has even come close. Pele was not just King of club football with incredible consistency as Messi has been, but also King of international football with incredible consistency which Messi has not been able to do managing just one world cup by the skin of his teeth. Keeping up with Pele and trying to equal his achievements is so difficult Maradona had to take drugs to try to achieve it and failed and Messi is only just managing to keep up with Maradona's achievements. Pele could not lose 3 finals as Messi did, he was too good and that is why he won 3 world cups. Who would you say is the better player, a player that has come out of his box and dribbled or passed by a whole team to score a goal as Pele did at a time when it was legal to hack a player to the ground with no interest in the ball(resulting in a statue being raised at the stadium in memory of that goal), or a player like Messi who has never been able to do this even with rules that would get players sent of for such an act? A player who scored 1000 goals scoring 4 to 8 goals in some games, or a player who struggle to reach 750 Nd can only manage a maxim of 3 goals in some games? A player who can score with any kind of header when heading the ball, or a player who can only score the most basic header when using his head? A player that regularly scored goals from outside the box using both feet, or a player who can only score a goal with one foot when shooting from outside the box? A player that is so creative with the ball the public did not know what they would see him do in the next game, or a player that had 3 types of goals he scores all the time? A player who when defending can tackle as good as any defender when it comes to the defensive part of the game, or a player that can hardly tackle? There a reasons Pele us the greatest supported by facts, Messi's history does not the fact he should be seen as the greatest. Achieving what Pele did and transforming the game is not an easy thing to do and no one has ever come close.Not even Messi. Peace and love
This panel has been watering for this moment. Yes, Messi got his World Cup, deservedly so. But you can’t help but think if Ronaldo was placed in a team that played as well and unified as Argentina, it’s a no brainer his leadership and longevity would’ve won one too. It’s a sad reality that the lack of a team around cr7 is what will ultimately place him second in many peoples eyes.
Congrats to Argentina. But Messi is not the greatest. Football was not created in the 90s.
One Sun .. One Moon ..One Earth.. One GoAT 🐐 Leo Messi 🔥😎🔥
Messi is the undisputed goat
Two Goat debates closed in a week! Incredible!   Messi with the World Cup  And Jordan with the NBA renaming the MVP in his honor.   You love to see it 🥰.
Something happened to RONALDO! I don't buy this world cup WAKE UP People's! 👀
I love seeing Messi being carried around the stadium holding the Wold Cup trophy 🏆 just like Maradona 🕊️ in ‘86
Nah he’s not just the best of his generation. He’s the Goat. It’s not disrespectful every player has their opportunity to leave a legacy and how big that legacy is depends on them. Messi has surpassed everyone end of story
A great opening comment from Ale.
Happy Ending 💐💐💐
What an incredibly stupid debate it's always been. Who cares?
I lost some brain cells watching that game 😂
This is pure revisionism, Messi retired twice like a coward from Argentina's national team.
And then there was a man full of wisdom, who spoke with knowledge and understanding. Thank you Mr.Mark Ogden, for you gave an outstanding and honest opinion about the question. You cannot ever compare a KING to a goat, thank you.
Messi was the best..
KING LEO
I managed to escape a heart attack multiple times in this freaking game. Glad Messi & ARG  won but FRA did well also!
Give ronaldo the same team messi always had, he would of won 2 world cup by now and that's a fact, and 1 mor euros, don't compare ronaldo with shitty team all his career with messi Argentina
To be the GOAT you gotta win the World Cup and now Messi can claim that honour.  I still think Pele is the best but Messi...he's up there too.
The future debate will be - who is the Goat🐐 between Mbappe and Messi. Mbappe is only 24 and has already won a world Cup in 2018. If he can play to his present level now to Ronaldo's and Messi's level till his mid 30s, he can easily be the next 🐐Goat in football. Mbappe proved he is France's one man army today - the first person to score a hat trick in the world cup final since 1966.  After Messi, it's Mbappe next in line.
With this World Cup win here you can no longer argue that CR7 or Maradonna were better. Messi legitmately has a clear claim as the Greatest Player Ever. Literally nobody but Pele has an argument
how is he the best ever when he hasnt been the best ever in the whole world cup , and Mbappe was clearly the best player on the field today lol 😌 yall biased af lol Ronaldo is the Goat if u wanna go stats and trophies , its out of his control for not playing for portugal 🇵🇹
Not fair to judge.  Messi is surrounded by a whole team of all stars.  Ronaldo has always carried the team on his back.  Messi has a nation of 50 million to choose from for teammates.  If the ball is only going to be on the ground, I like Messi.  In any other situation, Ronaldo.
*Determining what soccer ⚽️ player footballer is the best of all times is completely SUBJECTIVE 🤔! What determines the best footballer? All-around athlete?*
Haha the British guy mention George Best and Man United in goat conversation 😂🤣🤡. Seriously no wonder why England can’t win major tournaments they are delusional
I can make a 2min reel of Messi getting kicked as well Mark…especially vs Jose’s Madrid
It's Platini who's the GOAT until the end of time
Now you know! It's settled. That's all I'm saying. Boom!
Moreno is right: “are we contractually obligated to always mention Cristiano in the goat conversation?”  It’s just ridicolous and unnecessary, two different categories.
Now i can give messi the throne 🤴
Arguments against Messi being the GOAT: 2020: he needs to win major trophy with Argentina 2021: won Copa America, BUT, he needs to win World Cup 2022: won World Cup, case closed
There should had never be one to begin with
Martinez won them that final in my opinion. Forget the penalties for a second, the save he made in the last minute was crazy.
It was rigged
Messi will never be better than Maradona. That’s the truth. Maradona influenced Argentina With a “hand of God” and goal of the century and pass for the winning goal for the final. He was Mbappe of 1986. That’s the difference. Messi won it in his own way. That’s the end of the debate. And Ronaldo is an amazing player. Also Maradona won it at 25.
This just shows how stupid Barcelona have been, they wasted 3/4 years of messi by signing the wrong players.  This Argentina team just shows, if you put aggressive,hardworking athletic players around him you will simply win, wasting money on coutinho/dembele and all the others.
Yes the game was more physical/violent back in the day, but the game now is also more athletic, the Centre backs now are all bigger and faster, no era is harder just different.  Just like people say the NBA was tougher in the 80/90s, todays NBA everyone is pretty much 6ft8/9 at least and can move, shoot etc
MESSI GOAT🐐 :  To Cristiano fans ...  ( Excluding club friendlies)  Cristiano has 234 assists in 1145 games....Messi has 350 assists in 1003 games...Messi has only 25 goals  less than Cristiano and has played 142 games less...Cristiano's career is over,Messi keeps killing...Cristiano this year has 1 goal and 0 assists in 10 games with MAN. UN. 😂 🤣 and Messi has 7 goals and 10 assists in 13 games with P.S.G...so it's a matter of time for Messi to surpass Cristiano's total goals...Until then,just remember...Cristiano total 1053 goals+assists in 1145 games and Messi 1143 total goals+assists in 1003 games... To Maradona fans : Maradona has 293 goals in 582 games ...and most important : Maradona overall stats for Argentina : Appearances: 91 , Goals 34 ,2 World Cup finals-1 Trophy,  3 Copa America appearances ,0 finals,4 goals ,0 assists!!! Messi overall stats for Argentina : Appearances: 172 , Goals 98, Assists 53,2 World Cup finals-1 Trophy,3 Copa America finals,won the award for young player of the tournament in 2007,13 goals and 6 assists in 35 games, 4 goals and 5 assists in the winning 2021 Copa America against Brazil at Maracana !!!
In this generation yes but in history is just about upside Diego and Pele. Certainly had many more attempts at it!?
In international tournaments: Di Maria > Messi
He was already the 🐐 but now he’s solidified it. Messi is levels above the rest.
MESSI MESSI MESSI MESSI MESSI MESSI MESSI MESSI MESSI MESSI  THE WORLD CUP CHAMPION. THE ONLY G.O.A.T. MESSI, LEO MESSI.
MESSI is the GOAT. Mbappe is up next!!🙌❤🏆🐐⚽️🔥.
Messi is jus NOT FROM THIS PLANET EARTH 🌎 💯 ..
🐐🐐
What bugs me is you forget pele won 3 WC and he won domestic trophys there was no CL his days either and every twist turn goal flick back flick pele did that all but his coverage was not of today pele won his last World Cup 35 years old pele won when he was jus the age of 17
This game was predestined, this was meant to be, nothing could hinder him from winning tonight. All by the grace of God. Incredible game and what a way for Messi to cement his goat status. Truly the greatest I’ve seen. Wonderful footballer. Congratulations Argentina, Congratulations Messi.   Side note, Mbappe, you are incredible, I doubted you before this game and thought that the comparisons you were getting to some of the greats of the game was too much, but tonight, you’ve shown that you truly are a great. I salute you
5:40 well said....there's NO point comparing.....just have a dozen great players and just say they were all great, at another level...this thing of "Oh Messi is the best ever" is just nonsense.......I grew up watching Maradona in the 80s (and Platini, Baggio, Zico, Futre etc...) Maradona was seriously tackled and kicked every couple of minutes...Messi has never had to face that, so to me, no comparison, Diego was in a different league
The passing of the batton from messi to mbappe
World cup is a team effort.   It's not a gadget for goat.  Haalland didn't even get to play , doesn't mean he's not good.   This doesn't mean anything.
I agree with Matt... Maradona to do that with the treatment he got back in the days and still manage to blow everyone away was in a different planet.... For me Messi is one of the greatest but for me Maradona is still the greatest...
MARADONA won the WORLD CUP  Wit a BROKEN Ankle!!!!!!!! He's the  Real GOAT 🐐
the goat debate already end at 2009 since based on individual abilities messi already better than cristiano. this more evident after cristiano got knee injury at 2014. messi winning wc only to shut delusional ronaldo fanboy up. still being no 2 isnt that bad, respect to him. were blessed to see both messi and cristiano playing.
What a year for Ronaldo
PELE, MARADONA, SULTAN KING MESSI.. Called The Legends.🏆🏆🏆..... and Penaldo just Bench Legend 🤣
ESPN is so sexists. What about Matha from Brasil. She could have also been in the list. Is female soccer not worth a mention ESPN. I did not know that greatest player ever was code for men only.
Messi got best player in 14 but he wasn't  and was disappointing in what should have been his prime. But this was perfect way to finish it. He deserved it and the title.
Messi is the best player ever
“With All Due Respect” But, Why hasn’t anybody mentioned that argentina was about to win 2-zip (with 10-15 minutes left) until that Stuuupid and  (Extremely) Unnecessary Foul that changed “EVERYTHING” !!! Until then, They were (Most Definitely) without a doubt “Dominating” !!! Mbappe was given 1 opportunity (with that mistake) and he took it. That one mistake did not change what turned out to be the final outcome we had been expecting (earlier), but it did turn it into a totally different game, where Argentina  (& Messi) had to dig  (Much) “Deeper.”
I Just can’t understand why these weak reporters and sensationalist ESPN programs can’t just appreciate watching 2 of the greatest players of all time and need to keep making useless comparisons. Poor journalism from a weak program.
I think GOAT debate is unproductive, especially because a lot of things are being built upon each other. For example, Is it possible for Messi to be this great if Maradona was never around? Ronaldinho never played? Xavi was such a great treammate? Or CR7 was always there as a rival? Etc etc..  But, I understand why people are invested in the GOAT debate. To be fair, if I have to choose who is the most decorated modern footballer, it'd be Leo Messi
Totally agree with Mark. This Goat debate is getting ridiculous.
Mark Ogden has no idea.
Mbappe will over take Messi at some point......the guy's only 23, already has one WC and now one 2nd place....has 12 WC goals (with another 2-3 WCs in him at least, at his age)...he'll be the first to hot 20 WC goals in coming years....
What an outstanding final world cup Game. Leo Messi CONGRATULATION
Totally respect ALE, unnecessary comparison topic with still the G O A T E S T Maradona.  Anti Ronaldo deluded LME; "I loved working for this show"   **do not put a lady for football discussions, period 😆😆
Penaldo is going to be 😭 for a month. Ale doesn't realise how great a day this is for Ronaldo haters 🤣😂😅. Messi always greater footballer but its the joy of thinking of Penaldo watching it after souring good Portugal squad 😃
“Where is Messi?”  On the stage.
In my opinion I don't think Kylian Mbappé is the best of the world. He won a World Cup but he hasn't won a CL, Euros or Ballon D' Or yet. If that's what the best of the world is being judged on than it should be applied to any player
Messi is the best of all time because there is no story to sell if it is Maradona.
It's the best match I ever watched in my entire life, Messi is a goat but mbappe played fantastic
So, I didn’t throwing there was a debate prior to this World Cup, but now all the Ronaldo fans can shut up! It’s over, Messi is the GOAT, Ronaldo could barely get on the pitch, made very little difference in the World Cup.
Stilll the Bzt Goat CR7❤
What’s wrong with this people … anything happens they always come back to Cristiano 😂
Hello from Finland, Messis performance in this turnament is ridigouls for a 35' old player, fooling one of the best defender player on the turnament, and shooting 2nd highest amount goals altho many from penalty kicks but they gave them to him to respect him and his final world cup, such a pleasent games to watch from Argentina. This performance at hes age speaks to itself. The Goat!
In Maradona's time, soccer was not on the same level! People were slower, defenders less professional, fewer people played soccer, and there was less money in the sport!
I wonder if Messi would like to coach in the future. If not, that is ok.
CR7 Forever ⚽
please anyone say that did dembele really pushed di maria in the box or did he trip his leg
Leaves Barcelona, wins the World Cup! What a story tbh, the story of Lionel Messi. This is what the football Gods wanted!
That last guy was SPEAKING ABSOLUTE NONSENSE 😂😂😂. REST BRO, Messi the G.O.A.T 🐐🙌🏾
Yeah, the debate is over. And not only with regard to CR7. Messi has won it all, broke many records of others (like Pele and Maradona) while establishing new ones himself, played like Ronaldo Nazario or Ronaldinho in his prime, delivered the greatest performance of his life at 35 (crazy longevity) and is even outpacing CR7 when it comes to international goals (CR7 still has more, but less than 30 and over a span of 150 matches... Messi could break that one too). And so many other things. He IS the GOAT, and that's objectively. Everything is just denial/bargaining/refusal. He will continue being so until someone else (perhaps, Mbappé) archieves more. It's a tall order for Mbappé.
he is not better than Maradona he is equal to him  and the reason is that Maradona helped a below par napoli win everything single handedly   whereas Messi won everything with a star studded Barcelona
ESPN Settling a debate that was settled back in 2016 is so funny lmao!
Messi not even close to Pele or mbappe international level , it's first WC after 4 try lol 😂
Mbappe is a beast. Quiet almost the whole game and turned things around in 90+ seconds. But Messi is just something else. To do what he’s done at the age of 35, Truly the Greatest Of All Time. ❤
messi was the best player of all time before the world cup. Him winning the world cup just puts him more levels above Ronaldo.
Ronaldo was never in the debate , he is a fake. Spoilt, arrogant prima Donna
ESPN planed
The prophet (Messi) delivered the trophy for Argentina finally. But the God (Maradona) delivered it first in 1986.
History was made today Messi was destined to win this World Cup he’s a legend !
Bet if CR7 won the vid would've been 4mins
Pele looked way better than Messi even with black and white highlights
Freedom for Palestine and Gaza 🇵🇸 🇶🇦❤️🇦🇷❤️🇵🇸
Ogden gotta clam down about the coke head maradona lol
Cristiano The best at all time 🐐👑🙏💪
The Englishman's analysis makes sense. It is devoid of emotion and grounded in facts and reason. It depends on the era and the audience at a given time. Too much emotionalism and subjectivity when discussing these issues. For me a pointless discussion.
I am not sure why we keep avoiding the fact  - The personal battle won by Mbappe, however the World Cup won by Argentina. Fact::
Mark was spot on!!💯
Definitely Messi the best natural talent .  Ibra said its like play - station that's Messi  Ronaldo is probably better product of enormous work ethic and more promotable overall . And IMO during time when Pele and Maradona played AVERAGE player was NOT  on the level of AVERAGE player TODAY . So  all that in mind we have a GOAT 🐐  Case closed !!!      And  big shout out to my Croatian players for great achievement 👏 🇭🇷⚽️
RONALDO LEAVING REAL MADRID WAS THE BIGGEST SET BACK IN HIS CAREER
Don't compare Messi to maradona, Messi just scored few penalties this world cup
nuff said.
maradonna better
Ale is right… absolutely no point in comparing Messi to Ronaldo. One is or was a tap in merchant (now can barely score) the other just scored and won in a World Cup final. Guess who is who…
This debate has become a joke now
I don’t even understand the 3rd guy point. We are not talking about generation, we are talking about all time. No one said anything bad about the previous players. Zidane was the greatest of which generation? Better than R9? Zidane was one of the best, not the best.
Messi is the Goat🐐🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
23 years old Mbappe had to score a hattrick to almost break dreams of the Real Goat Messi who is 35 years old .... man levels man!!
There is only one Maradona and he is soccer's GOAT.  Messi, Palé, Ronaldo etc are equal second best.  Anyway, love that World Cup fans of all teams expressed their support for the oppressed Palestinian people and shunned journalists from the racist and artificial state of Israel
Messi never needed this he’s been the GOAT for a long time but this is just the cherry on top.
GOAT order: 1. Pele 2. Maradona 3. Messi
All real football fans wanted messi to win the World Cup
The debate is done!!! Lionel is the GOAT!!!
You can not Define a Soccer World Player Champion 🐐 only Because is ALL Team won the World Cup ! After 14 Years of Trying with Messi in !!  It loocks like you are Blind and Messi Fanatics ! And not looking at the Soccer History Between Ronaldo and Messi !
CR7 is off the topic
Spain lost in their first game, the rest is history. Argentine lost against Saudi Arabia....and you know what happened after that
Agree with Ale… it was never Messi v Ronaldo… Messi is one of the greats, and so is Ronaldo, and so is Maradona, and so is Pele, and so is Cruyff… and the list goes on. Each great had their time . Just enjoy the game!
Reason why Messi is the GOAT is the because his peak has lasted for almost 17 years. That's longevity only one other player can brag of and that's Ronaldo. He is not just special, he has been special for his entire career. That's gonna be hard to replicate.
Won World Cup by penalty shootout is not counted! Or can only half counted.  Messi is still half tier below Maradona.
Messi is not the greatest footballer of all time. He is the greatest of our generation.
It was destiny.
Best in the history, well said my fri
We can surely say Messi is the best of his time but definitely not greatest of all time as different generation has player's like Pele & Maradona who were clearly better than everyone else at their time. There's a reason why they were legends & u cannot compare era's & consider just 1 individual superior to everyone else...
I agree with Mark ogden .Every generation has its best player.50's Distefano,60's pele,70's Cruyff ,80's Maradona,90's Zidane and our generation Messi.This debate will go on .Mbappe 23 has won a World cup and played another final though he still has to win a Champions league which is tougher to win then the W.Cup .Who knows in 5 years time  the debate will be is he the greatest of all time.
The GOAT debate with continue but Messi is the best player of this generation and maybe the best ever and CR7 has to accept that whether he like it or not
Worldcup fixed
King Messi !
Salty United fans always barge into the goat conversation and bring up people like “George best” mate he was good your smoking crack him over messi
You can't really compare messi n ronaldo int career. No offence but until this year Portugal have had a weak world cup team. I think it's harder to drag Portugal than it is Argentina . The Argentina Portugal debate inst realistic to comparing Ronaldo and Messi cause its genuinely not fair. Look I think Messi the GOAT but I don't think it's a fair argument and this us where the debate should end.
No way Messi surpassed Maradona. He won World Cup by penalty shootout, which is less convincing. He is still an half tier below Maradona.
Where is shalka🤣🤣🤣
SHUT UP UNITED FAN KEEP CRYING OGGIE
Mark Ogden wrong shut it Messi is the only goat
Indeed the goat debate between Messi and CR7 is over. It’s neither. Mbappe has surpassed them both after today’s performance
Well said Ale ! It was the Messi show, he is the best player in the history of the game
As a Ronaldo fan Messi is the best ever to kick ball but if Ronaldo wasn’t good we wouldn’t compare him to Messi both proved that they’re the best the world ever witnessed! Congrats to Argentina and Messi truly well deserved 👏🏼👏🏼
why is he so mad about Messi vs Ronaldo. Its just a fun little thing people argue about.
Guys, if PSG doesn't atleast reach the semifinals of the champions league, I would tag them a failure. You can't have Messi, Mbappe and Neymar in the same team and underperform.
Messi #1  Ronaldo #2  Of this generation  We actually underestimate their trophies and stats, these guys are light years ahead of everyone.  Mbappe is probably gonna be most definitely gonna be up there, Messi and Ronaldo have just pass on a baton
It is a disgrace you put Messi’s name with Cristiano. Cristiano is the goat.
Very nicely put very great moment for all us football fans
When your grand parents say this is the best World Cup they’ve seen you best believe it
It's really sad for Ronaldo his career Is over I do not think he will be playing at a big club
That was hands down the greatest football match ever
Messi🇦🇷 already deserved the title of the GOAT🐐 Ronaldo🇵🇹 deserved to be the best player of all time🐐
This is not a debate about best footballer but now you have to compare Messi with Jordan and Brady for best athlete of all time.
An Aston Villa player is a World Cup winner. lol
CLASSIC GAME
Goats of each generaton (1958-) 1st gen: pele 2nd gen: maradona 3rd gen: r9 or zidane 4th gen: messi 5th gen: mbappe
In 30+ years people will be saying Messi is overrated...
MESSI IS THE FUKENNN GOATTTTT THE ONLY MESSSI MESSSI MESSI I WANT HEAR YALL FRANCE HATERS I WANT TO HEAR YALL THE FUKEN GOAT HERE
im Glad he won bcz he has restored faith in life   he is proof that nomatter what you go through in life the hardships people looking down on you mocking you its never later , just bcz people younger than you have succeeded before you it doesn't mean you wont succeed your time will come have faith and keep working hard
Not the greatest game in football by any measure.  Very dramatic in the biggest game, yes, but in terms of quality, have seen better games in Champions league, quite a few.
Pain for toxic media 🇦🇷 won the world cup 😭😭
“ MESSI IS NOT THE GREATEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME” MESSI IS THE GREATEST ATHLETE OF ALL TIME!!!  IM GLAD IM ALIVE TO WITNESS THIS PLAYER, GOD YOUR WONDERFUL 👏🏻🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐🐐
Who is the best striker in the history of football 🤫🤫🤫🤫 Most hattricks Most goals in national team and champions league
What would be the purpose of flooding a site's comment section with "seemingly more natural" bots as fans? Not directed at anyone or anything in sports here, but just that phenomenon.
Messi does things no one else can do , he is gifted from God ..Amazing talent and im fortunate to be alive to witness hes genius . Literally the absolute best never been a debate for me
The player (voted best player of the century in Europe) that was the best of his time and had the most influence on world football ever was Johan Cruijff.
I am waiting for the Netflix film about Messi…(though I know the real life will always  better than any film 😅)
There is NO debate! Lets look at the body of work from these top players… Pele never played in Europe, he does not know what it is to win s Champions League, never won a Copa America, never won a Balon D’or. Maradonna never won a Copa America, never won a Balon D’or, in todays game that ball he hit with his hand would have never counted, and possibly would not have won the Cup that year. Messi has won every Trophy in Europe, La Liga, Champions League, Euro Cup, Pichichi, 7 Balon D’or, World Cup and he still has 3 to 4 good years left in his career. There is no Doubt that LIONEL MESSI IS THE GREATEST FOOTBALLER IN THE HISTORY OF THE SPORT!  PERIOD!!!!!!
God bless Venezuela
God bless Cuba
My mom was watching the game with me and I kept telling her the game isn't over till it's over and that happened twice in this match. Argentina looked like they won the game twice but France leveled. Sucks being a neutral because I can imagine the roller coaster it must have been for the French and Argentinian fans.
Another fixed rigged game since the beginning refs favoring them 🗑 🚮  so guess this means mbappe is the 🐐 since he already has a 🌎 cup at 19 and already has more goals than pessi and cr7 if this idiots gonna put it like that 🤷‍♂️😁
The debate is over now and forever 🇦🇷🇿🇲🇦🇷🇿🇲🇦🇷🇿🇲 Messi the best of all times 👑👑👑🦌🦌🦌
My money was on Argentina to win since they beat and controlled many opponents throughout the whole tournament especially against the Netherlands; the way Argentina linked up against the Netherlands after they tied the game convinced me they could win it. This game was 3x better than I expected. Easily a highly memorable game and arguably the best final in anything. Messi was very critical this game and showed his quality. Irreplaceable man. What a legend.
Where is Mr. Sucka ? Please let him say something.
On the bright side the future is still bright and Mbappe sits on top in his generation!! POV:Was supporting Argentina
Messi and Argentina was pretty much favoured by the referees throughout the tournament. Six penalties in Seven games says it all. Argentina’s penalties against Poland, Netherlands, Croatia and France were an embarrassment to everything about football. (Not a Ronaldo fan by the way).

Finally Messi gave us his last dance!  What a slap on the face of all western main stream media who was all barking for France! It just feel good when one of the worst European imperial colonizer get beaten and humiliated on  world stage!
Messi is the undisputed goat and anyone who tries to debate know they are lying to themselves
Maradona played two world cup finals too.
Why does Ronaldo get knocked for not getting a World Cup title? No offense, but does any ever expect Portugal to ever win a WC?
This feels like the cavs win against the warriors, messi an old instigator against the young French mbappe team, like lebron vs the young warriors and curry
There was never any GOAT debate. Messi was astonishingly clear off Ronaldo.
How does this affect lebrons legacy....🤔
Messi was simply not gonna allow them to lose again, he should not even be mentioned in same sentence as Mbappe or Ronaldo it tarnishes the greatness of Messi. If Messi had same team as France he would win more cups than pele
The best player was and would be Maradona.
I love CR7, but this is karma for his childish behavior as an older "mature" experienced player. The Piers Morgan interview, leaving early for a few matches at United, the allegations as we all know, and for his apparently difficult to deal with attitude. Now he was benched for crucial matches during his last world cup in which Fernando Santos has no regrets for not starting him, is without a club, and now his biggest rival has won a cup he will always dream about holding. All because he refuses to be one word that takes all of us far in life: humble. Down vote me all you want, but he wholeheartedly deserved this disastrous and sour ending to his career.
Maradroggy in his shadow now...
Coman and Camavinga changed the tempo of the game for France.
We do not need yrs debate chutes
U looooserssss Messi is goat 🐐
Nahhhhh Messi is the best  ever player in the world ever. 15 years at this level.
PELE is the GOAT though
People were calling Messi the GOAT 11 years ago so this is funny lol
Messi is the best of the best no doubts
French fans were very stupid for underrating Messi with or without a World Cup Messi is the best
The secret of Messi success is humble Messi too humble he never disrespect club or insult coach but that other player hmm I didn’t call name
Messi is the Goat of this generation. Respect to all the great players of the past that raised the bar for him to reach this level. Congratulations Argentina!
Now the debate is between mbappe and Ronaldo it’s not messi anymore
Cristiano Ronaldo is my fave player and always will be but I do have Messi as the goat and I wanted him to win because of all that he has given football. Well deserved and props to the Argentina team who had players step up throughout the tournament.

Media all the way with messi. Media hates ronaldo but messi gets the media love. Look at the narrative
It was just like a boxing fight. KO after KO both heavyweights gave it all till the end. Glad I witnessed it live. Breathtaking.
Mbappe was the best player of the final. Messi is the GOAT.
Let’s bury the hatchet (R…o) now and forever. Don’t even ever dare to compare with King Messi.
LITTLE Messi is not the GREATEST PLAYER EVER.
good job leo, we are all proud of you
Ale, You have exactly described my thoughts, Thanks and congratulations.
Ronaldo still the 🐐
Messi is greatest of his generation but Maradona was a King 👑 Absolutely unstoppable Rustless
Vamos Argentina! South American Football triumphed over European teams. Hope this also settles the debate to those underestimating South American teams.
I don't know why we have to shoehorn Ronaldo into this.  The truest statement a pundit ever said.  Yes the media has been contractually obliged to mention christiano alongside Messi,  and that's a fact
A bit ridiculous that Leo Messi is best player of world cup when he is not best scorer and 4 out 7 goals were penalties. His teammate Alvarez would be ahead of Mbappe even if he was given the option to score the 5 penalties opportunities Messi got. Not removing the Goat factor and brilliant player he his. Its just a bit distorted reality in my opinion.
Argentina’s 2nd goal was spectacular. Their counter attack was technical and smooth. I felt like I was part of that counter attack 😂 I was running with the ball even though I was standing lol
Messsi mesiii
I am united fan and been a Ronaldo fan since I followed united in 2007. But when I watched Messi especially in 2010 I knew he was the greatest player to ever walk the earth. There is no player like him and there never will be. But there will be more players like Ronaldo.
CR7 the 🐐 of all times 👑 ❤️
Ogden....you can put together a 2m clip of messi being savaged as well.  He added nothing to this conversation.  Daft.
Any ronaldo fan that changed their mind who the goat is? 😅 If not, how is Ronaldo the GOAT and not Messi?
The World Cup was rigged. The penalty given against Dembele wasn’t a penalty. ESPN is now happy for Messi 😂😂😂
That Mark guy is so funny. Please tell him Messi finally won a World Cup. Pele and Maradona never won Copa America. Messi has 7 ballon d’or awards and 4 champions leagues. Messi is the GOAT
I agree with Ale
I've always preferred cr7 but Messi is a player I can never casually critique. Messi is a king in football and deserves his respect just like cr7 and all legends.
Poisoning France Argentina Ref and still  France played on. Match should've ended regular time France 4-2 Argentina. Asterisk WC Russia illegally banned due to western propaganda 🙄
Not ever dinho R10 was best ever no one like him. If Messi is an alien dinho is a God
🤦‍♂️.. it was never a debate
The third person just lecturing 😭😭😭😭
Finally messi only the goat😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉😊
I’m Portuguese and today the debate ended: Messi is the GOAT.  And honestly, at the end of their respective careers, Mbappe will probably end up being better than Ronaldo.
Where is Shaka?
So now I seriously question!  How is it possible NOW that PSG still can't win a champions league with these two top world cup performers in the same team????
That's the time I've heard pundits talk football with a different view n knowing what the game is
Oh how these haters couldn't wait in this day to finally try and put him above cr7 no matter the biased and the wc being rigged he's my workds best player espn can stop calling his name now for views its full time we don't need a goat when we have a GOD
Messi is not the the best player ever but he is the best player of his generation. He never played against El Fenemeno ( the only player who got poisoned so he won’t play in the final) ; Maradona; Pelé; Romario; Zidane; and so on. Therefore, Messi is the best player of his generation.
Fifa corrupted  give it to messi cr7 always the goat
Mark Ogden just sat the boys down with his argument. I have to agree with him
Ronaldo's numbers don't lie, the real goat  CR7
Where are all the penaldo fans? 😂
Pele, Messi and Maradona(the football gods), everybody else is way below them.
GOAT is nonsense, each generation is different. However, it solidifies him as the best player of his generation.
Pele is the best ever
People always say he's more of a team player now he's older and the fact is he's always been a team player his assist numbers show that
No one has yet to win 3 world cups............Pele is the best player in world
He can be considered a great, so is Ronaldo, it’s very simple
Messi and reffery that push Argentina last 3 matches lmao really pathetic world cup !
Where are you Ronaldo fanboys? Let me taste them delicious tears. Messi is the GOAT
Messi won just leave it at that is like it is in y’all contract to talk about cr7 😂 it’s annoying
Anyone have a link of Shaka saying it? Been waiting years for him to finally admit it
Ogden still hating. Lol
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Does he eclipse pele?
You are a big Liar !! Because the Best Soccer Player in the world still  Ronaldo with 118 goals ! And Messi only 98 in History  Congratulations to Argentina All Team  !! Because Messi Did not Made the Diference
He has won every trophy he has competed for. GREATNESS of the GOAT!!!!
Am upset that france lost as a france supporter but am happy atleast one legend won, messi actually never needed a wc to prove himself ,neither does any other legend , and as much as i admire messi for his talent,and capability i don’t think any prize can end the debate,people can always argue ,everybody have their own preference,everybody have their own points , everybody is entitled to their own opinions,if goat debate was suppose to be like that pele maradona had done it back thn , zidane ,Brazilian ronaldo ronaldindho all had won all major prizes ,specially zidane the way he won & achieved everything in football ,n there are greats who never won something big like ucl for example r9 ,does that make him less of a legend or goat ! no matter what media tries to show ,this won’t change the fact that ,this things never end , its all endless stuffs ,you can never put a full stop ,just like am not going to put here in my statement
Maradona was a coke head and could take the battering because of so. Messi is the GOAT!
I feel incredibly fortunate to have seen Messi and Ronaldo play. Thanks Messi for existing and today winning this cup, my mental health was onn stake.
It's called soccer
This simply solidified Messi’s place amongst the history of his national team but it in no way places him above Ronaldo they are equal (for me anyway.)  Argentina have the most ever Copa America’s, Ronaldo won Portugal their first Euro   Argentina were successful in world football long before Messi. Portugal were nowhere before Ronaldo in fact mostly they didn’t even qualify for the World cup so these things should be looked at with context   But Narrative wins everytime
GREAT GAME, BUT I ADMIRE THE FRENCH FOR THEIR HUMBLENESS. THEY WERE ROBBED. MESSI WAS CLEARLY OFFSIDE BEFORE SCORING HIS GOAL AND IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED. YOU CANNOT BE OFFSIDE AND THE REFEREE WAVES PLAY ON WHEN YOU ARE BENEFITING FROM THE PLAY ON. YOU CAN ONLY SAY PLAY ON IF THE TEAM WHO DESERVED THE FREE KICK ARE BENEFITTING. MESSI WAS NOT ONLY OFFSIDE, BUT HE WAS THEN THE PLAYER THAT WENT ON TO SCORE FROM THE CONTINUED PLAY. THAT WAS DISGRACEFUL, ESPECIALLY WHEN FRANCE IN EARLIER PLAY HAD BROKEN AND WERE GOING TO BE 3 AGAINST 3 WITH THE ARGENTINIAN DEFENCE WITH MBAPPE TPO DEFEND AGAINST, BUT THEN THE REFEREE STOPPED PLAY TO MAKE THE FRENCH BRING THE BALL BACK TO TAKE A FREE KICK WHEN THEY WOULD HAVE PREFERED TO AND WOULD HAVE BENEFITED FROM PLAYING ON AND THE REFEREE KNEW THIS. FRANCE WERE ROBBED, CLEAR AS DAY LIGHT!!!  ARGENTINA BEING AWARDED 5 PENALTIES IN 7 GAMES IS IN ITSELF QUITE REVEALING ON THE QUESTION OF BIAS FROM THE OFFICIALS. IF THE GAME WAS BETWEEN 2 TEAMS AND NO ONE ELSE, FRANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE WINNERS OF THIS WORLD CUP, BUT THEY WERE ROBBED. Peace and love
eclipses maradona? espn should close.
ESPN I was bored of listening to the arguments....Why not give the Credit only Messi is the best...🍷
messi is outstanding
Yes with 5 penalties in 7 games i can be "GOAT" too without a problem
Messi is the GOAT no doubt. He kept up with a young Mbappe lb for lb. Won’t the last trophy he needed. Vamos Messi!
Hard disagree. Maradona and Pelé are still ahead
mark isnt accounting for the fact even if you adjust for 'skill inflation' or the game changing that he isn't just the best of his generation but head and shoulders above anyone else 6 golden boots 8 pichichi 7 bdo 10 league titles etc etc half any of those and he' still the best of his generation, so the fact its doubled what a typical generational best player would have proves his above pele/maradona
IT’s preference people I love Messi’s game over CR7 but that doesn’t mean  I don’t like CR7 his amazing young Rolando was unstoppable . I’m just thankful for all the years they went back and fourth it sucks it’s coming to an end but Mbapee just proved tonight that his that guy this generation
What are they gonna say now ????
MESSI IS THE 🐐 WAS THE 🐐  AND OFC WILL EVER BE THE 🐐EST
Pele is the best please stop
Let’s remember we are talking about a 35yr old. Messi is old and not as fast and powerful as he used to be, but his unrivaled skills as a footballer is pretty much timeless.
Somebody needs to remind Alejandro that Maradona also was caught Doping. Messi never.
Congratulations to argentina and I'm very happy for messi. That goal keeper is a weapon. Also messi is THEE best player ever.  No arguments no ifs no buts. It is what it is. God bless all.
I believe if fat Ronald has the work ethic of Messi and C. Ronaldo, he would be the best player of all time. 😂
The Beavis and buthead debate
As a die hard CR7 fan, I congratulate Messi for his efforts. He has ended the goat debate, however, Messi and CR7 are both goats in their own rights. This was a big icing on the cake for Messi in particular.
The comedy about the messi hating so called pundit is  that when it's ronaldo they compare him with messi to say he is GOAT and then when messi comes in the conversation they start jumping into conclusions by bringing in Maradona and  Pele into conversation such hypocrites...now suddenly the game for them was brutal but again the game then did not have such cameras where they watch and analyze your every move or high speed defenders than can break you anyday...so don't comparer this Era with that because this is a far higher one...where the players have to evolve everyday
💯🇦🇷v🇫🇷 Worthy of a final . Argentina was dominant till first 80 minutes after that the game was 🔥& Argentina were pathetic . The second penalty given to france was no way a penalty . Respect to  Messi🇦🇷🇦🇷 Finally he did it . This man is just wow🔥, 9 goal contributions is mad + his no look assist against Netherland was no 1 for me in this world cup  👌🥇🔥.  Argentina goalkeeper Martinez was exceptional in world 🌎🏆 final ,Di Maria also superb . Overall Insane world cup ⚽🌎🏆 this was. Finally  🇦🇷Fifa ⚽🌎🏆Cup 2022 champions 🎯
This tournament killed every objection all the messi haters had.  1. Doesn’t do it in the big games (MOTM every knockout game) 2. Never won World Cup  3. Can’t perform without world class players  4. Bad at penalty  5. Not a leader  All those objections are dead now.
Naming someone the GOAT doesn’t mean you disrespect every player that come before him… Many great players paved the way for this generation for sure, but there is no doubt that this generation of players have taken the game to the next level. And given everything Messi has achieved, he deserved the title 🎉 🐐👑
Vamos Argentina 🇦🇷  but I can still see france🇫🇷 dominating the next euro and the 2026 world cup because the way they are playing they will surely win one more world cup in the next 10 years
Messi scores penalties. he is clutch. Ronaldo scores penalties, He sucks "my grandmother can score penalty". "Penaldo". Idiots.   Ronaldo is the GOAT because he did it with the world against him.  Messi had everything organized for him.Gifted penalties in every stage of the cup. The world knows it whether they want to admit it or not. The reason Messi fans are always talking about CR7 is because deep down they know he is the boss. You guys needed coaches to bench CR7 in order to stop him. Ronaldo is not retiring anytime soon. He will still go down as a legend, as much as the media would like to erase him from history.
ARGUMENT DONE 🤐 LEONEL MESSI the goat 🐐 without a doubt.💪🏿✅⚽️🇯🇲
Maradona have 0 copa America Maradona had 34goals Messi 1 copa America  Messi have 98goals Maradona 0 ucl Messi 4 Maradona 0 Olympic Messi 1.. Cr7 is better than Maradona for me..
Maaan why do stubborn old people can't handle the truth, you CAN compare him to Diego statistics simple as that, and he is even better because the sports always become more competitive a lot more competitive there is a lot more talent interested in playing and it is way hard now, stop with your reaching and accept it, if it's your opinion ok but don't say you cannot compare get out of here

6:36 he is basically saying "messi is the best but out of respect we will call it the best of generation not of all time. i refuse to make it of all time because i believed something else for so long'
God status Achieved, For any doubters.
Talking heads so desperate to find the goat. Good lord let it go already.
Where is shaka
The save Martinez did in the last minute of the game was similar as the one of Iker Casillas did in World Cup final 2010 against Robben. Save of the tournament
Messi wouldn't survive in the days of Pele and Maradona. He would be in a wheel chair right now. But yet, he is the best player in the last 20 years. No doubt.
With this win Messi and Argentina have an 'International Treble' of sorts in which they are the current South American Champions for beating Brazil to win the Copa America. Current Intercontinental Champions of South American & Europe for winning the Finalissima against Italy, and of course World Champions for beating France in the World Cup! Messi and Argentina are the first to ever hold all 3 at the same time.
Enough of this donkey, monkey debate.we have seen on the best final in world cup history. Why no body is talking mbappa.what a come back.They should finish 4-3 had they missed that chance. Well played France.
This first dude was a party pooper. Like bro stop being a buzz kill and do your job 😂😂😂
It was a corrupt world cup win meaning argentina had most penalties out of any world cup in history. Which changes games
Obviously done cr7 haters
These clowns love Messi
Zidane can't lace Messi's boots. Stop it. Zidane wasn't even the best player on his Madrid team.
Griezeman was one of their best players
Thank you Ale Moreno for this take that you’ve given us in response to Messi vs Cr7 , THOSE people have been given their answer & to everyone else who watches for the love of the game and appreciate that greatness these players bring to the pitch game in and game out
“Are we contractually obligated to talk about this” killed me 😂😂🫶🏽
Diego & Lionel GOATs
CR7 is the 🐐
Any one at ESPN or the world who thinks messi is the best ever us just racist and illiterate. Pele won 3 world cups v messi with 1 and has scored tons more career goals than messi so how is it even possible for some with lesser achievement to be better? Garrincha has 2 world cups to messi's 1. You white people are just so disgusted that a black man/Pele is the GOAT in the game you claim to have invented.
The double sub before halftime for France was a curious one and then when Argies subbed Di Maria ... I thought, they could live to regret this one if it's a tactical move. Both moves were kinda strange given you need experience on the field in a world cup final. Piers Morgan tempted fate when he pre empted Messi losing the final and reopening the GOAT debate. No need for that now Piersy boy.
scripted wc oil money well spend
Lmao Ogden is clearly a messi hater.
ARG were handed 5 PKs in this tourney, the most to any 1 team, ever. and that first DiMaria PK, no VAR lmao
Mac Alister i thought was amazing, underrated performance
Wow Messi won the world cup so he suddenly knee jerks into being the goat. Fantastic player but get back to me when he's scored 800 plus and won titles in 3 top leagues. CR7 plays for Portugal so maybe it was not possible to win the world cup? Then to put him above Maradona because of 1 match?? Silly talk.  Diego is the real GOAT.
Come on bro !     Why is everyone hating so much against leo
Euros are a better tournament
Dude on bottom left is a hater. Point blank!
FIFA WC Qatar 2022 WAS THE BEST WORLD CUP EVER HOSTED... All political  agenda gone to the mud😂😂
Stop the bulshit guys!
Dude said messi didn't get kicked.....suck a toe , he is the goat  not because of the world Cup,  just compare his attributes to the best of the best , His passing , better than xavi and iniesta  Dribbling, better than Ronaldinho Shooting better than r9  Technique is world's above all others  Pace ridiculous  Touch unmatched  Vision unrivaled  Strength and balance never seen before let alone from someone his size and weight Free kicks only two equal him juninhio and r.Carlos  Plays all attacking positions and tracks back. Truly a blessing to have seen him play congratulations to the one and true goat. Messi
World Cup sealed it
Most Argentina fans in the world are not in Argentina, it’s in India. Fact.
Messi was 🐐 before and after but no disrespect to cr and maradona. All time greats who gave us so much entertainment 👏
"The magic man" - Peter Drury. He truly is. Messi was always the goat but winning the world cup had made him legendary!
Maradona was larger than Life. Maradona played in area where he was not protected.
06:00 less dangerous to play? Oh boy, I think it's time to rewatch some of the games between Barca and Real, because I think people already forgot how brutal it can get even these days.
Thank you Argentina, France, Qatar for the greatest final of all times. And thank you Messi and Mbappe
GOAT debates are stupid and infantile argument. Football is a team sport. A single tree cannot make a forest. Argentina won the World Cup, Capt by Messi. That's it.
Those guys won the trophy for talking BS  where is Pele stand in this conversation
Messi is the GOAT. Dude affected every game he played
Even Hollywood cannot/couldn't script this for a movie. By far, the best and most surreal football game ever played...!  Qatar also deserves a praise. This is a jewel in their world cup crown!!
CR7 is a 🐐 as well.
Argentina got every penalty they wanted lol 😂
What about Pele amateurs? Goodness find another job.
CR7 is my GOAT 🐐
Messi isn’t the GOAT. He’s talented and legendary but not the GOAT. For the record neither is C7R.
Ronaldo is still better to me argue with yourself
This bald man played in mls sit down
The American media at its finest. What a joke?
Just going to watch it again for fun 😊❤️
Excellent analysis by Ale
Those French subs hustled and worked hard. Dembele head was gone and Girouds dropped. Needed to be physical
My opinion would not change. He is the greatest player ever whatever the result, this is just extra fluff
For the views ale😂😂😂😂😂
Messi the GOAT 🐐. Period
These US news are so troll
Yeah as a Ronaldo fan Messi is the GOAT but doesn’t mean Mbappe can’t overtake him.
France manager is suspect
NEWSYSTEM
The goal keeper was great
Our dady mad ..😂😂
Is Messi better than Pele?
GET A LIFE ESPN 👎🏼  Alejandro Moreno’s take is the best 👍  STOP THIS BS LET THE LEGENDS LIVE
That penalty for argentina was discrasful no var ?? or var is only when it shoud be..
A rigged game followed up by mass mental illness. Unbelievable scenes
While I'm happy Argentinia won (and not just because my money was on them), the man of the match just HAS to be Mbappe, right? What a hero that guy, unbelievable!
u could never eclipse Maradona, never
I like how pele apparently is not in discussion lmao
MESSI IS THE GOAT 💙🇦🇷✨
This changes nothing to GOAT debate. Messi is the most eye pleasing player, similar to Maradona. Ronaldo is the GOAT
Pale had it easier playing against garbage men with terrible boots and poor fitness lol he’ll never be the GOAT because his football doesn’t compare with modern football  Players today have to keep up with better science and nutrition against players who are taken steroids to stay at the top   Todays football is a very hard game compared to the 60s 70s and 80s
Mbappe was unreal
Cristiano Ronaldo was, is and will always be the best. Remember Ronaldo plays for Portugal He's the one who brought history to this country. World cup is exaggerated expectation, just like expecting haaland to win WC with Norway.
The way some of these guys talk about Ronaldo...I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THESE GUYS PLAYED 🤣🤣👀
Ronaldo is in pains right now and he's is feeling real depression right now concerning the issues he has with Man united combined with the fact that they were knocked out of the WC..He now sees that Portugal doesn't depend on him again.Messi has shown that he's the best in the world.apart from scoring goals Messi is a playmaker,his presence makes you wanna watch..infact he's the G.O.A.T
Don't ever compare Messi to shitnaldo. Ever . Ever . Ever.
Thanks for being real Ale
Still in the shadow of marradona ..
Messi has always been better than Ronaldo. This World Cup just seals that for all eternity. The haters can make all the excuses they want, cry all they want and complain all they want, it will never take away what is reality now. Messi is the true GOAT 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👑👑👑🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Most people older than 40 would put Messi in the top 10 of all time. Ronaldo would be nowhere.
DEBATE IS OVER.
Tap in and a penalty, could you go any lower
Ronaldo is the Goat.
For me even Messi wasn’t going to win I was still going to say that Messi is goat and Ronaldo as well
Where is Shaka? 🤣😂😅
When Messi dribbles the ball, the ball stays glued to his feet.
How many time has that bald foo compared messi and Ronaldo for views now all of a sudden when it's clear messi won he calls it ridiculous 🙄
Mark shutup
The people that have that check list well move on. Now leave football
Mbappe would have been a god is he would have got this win.... a GOD!!!!! but that status was snatched away real quick..
Messi is playing in a generation that has enhanced football skills, analysis, and sports science. Maradona's generation wasn't as equally good.
They say if Messi win the world Cup then he is the GOAT well he won it he is the GOAT
Messi’s the best
Messi did nothing special in the whole match rather he got lucky to score some random penalties and on lucky shot.. While mbappe showcase a real talent and his first shot was absolutely on point 🔥 🎇
Listen from 5:27 if you want to hear some sense.
Nooooo!  Team game.  Portuguese Ronaldo team not good enough.  Real Ronaldo butchered by Italian league defense assassins.  Pele won more, without Barcelona super team.   Noooooo.
Di Maria is under rated. his ability is amazing on the ball.
Ronaldo was  never close lol
7:00 George Best is the GOAT as far as I am concerned.
The Goat debate should have already been officially settled. Today, Messi was crowned the greatest of all time and he completely deserves it. Thank you Messi for everything you have done. Congratulations to Argentina 🇦🇷 props to France and Mbappe they fought well, 🇫🇷👏 but Messi needed this. Credit to Scaloni and the team.
People praise Messi for being humble but can't remain humble themselves 🤣 Still going on with names such as Penaldo when even Messi considers him to be one of the greatest.
Not to be that guy because I appreciate both athletes but Ronaldo conquered the best leagues in Europe and is better with both feet and in the air, messi stayed in his comfort zone for 16 years and then went to France explain that
Obviously he’s better than Maradona 💀
Cheaters won and their best player was " Referee"  1.Penalty awarded for no reason to Arg. 2. No red card for Otamendi even though he was the last defender and he didn't attempt to play the ball. 3. No penalty for the foul on Thuram when there was clear contact when compared with the first one.
I'm with OGDEN... messi is great for his generation.. NOT ALL TIME.... NO WAY .. people are reaching saying that messi is the GOAT... Just doesn't sound fitting.
GOAT debate is not over. And never will be. But the Messi vs CR7 debate is over.
The goat
I rate Ronaldinho, Pele and maradona above messi.   In basketball Michael Jordan is the greatest ever and no one can argue that but in football things are different messi is one of the great.. not the greatest ever.
Mbappé will surpass Messi
Best game ever 💫 crazy crazy action for a world cup final. Un f** believable!!!!! Will be discussed for decades even centuries to come
Was only a debate for the hard of thinking. Ronaldo was never ever in the same league.
Tell that to arshole shaka ale
Just look at everyone ..just smiling nd happy ...
This program could definitely do without Aley.
That argentina keeper won the match for his country after that last minute one on one save.
that guy is bitter ofcourse messi is the goat. look how many years his done it for. no to mention he can easily play as a central mid and become the playmaker. and when needed he can make a quuick run and destroy the defence
What a beautiful answer by Ale❤️
I am a CR7 fan and after the match Messi is the Goat!!
Messi is the greatest ever of the last 15-17 years NOT EVER. You must be either delusional or just started watching football 7 years ago
Not the greatest game because France didn't do anything the first half!!!!  I'm for Ronaldo but messi passes now... Messi is not goat.... stop that people.. 1 cup.... no... not over Maradona and not over Pele.. no way..
Guys stop it! Who was GOAT? Johan Sebastian Bach or Mozart or Elvis. You Ale having been born in the late 70s could have never experienced Diego fully (just thru bedtime stories) stop this nonsense.
Zidane was not the best of his generation. Ronaldo Luis Nazario was the best player of that Generation.
A 35 years Lionel Messi has the golden ball in front of many young players in this World Cup... this shows that Leo is football and football is Leo
Consider the number of teams in the 70s,80s,90s and 2000+ taking part in the world cup..you will understand the stat how tough world cup competition.. Messi has done a tremendous jobs better than Maradona,Pele, Ronaldo from Brazil .. Messi was the best and the GOAT..
I still don't know that I'd put him ahead of Pelé but he's definitely ahead of Cristiano now. Pelé has the goals but he also won 2 world cups, something I believe only Mbappe has a chance of matching. Additionally people like to point out that Pelé never played in Europe but in his era there wasn't nearly as much of a disparity in the quality of futbol between Europe and South America. Relative to the competition on his time, I still think Pelé was more dominant but I still have messi at 2.
This is why the world is ungrateful. I grew up knowing only the “first” matters. This isn’t right. Let’s just take a moment and acknowledge the fact that mbappe won last cup and make a good come back this season but his teammates didn’t make him proud. Will you guys call CR7 the goat if he wins next cup??? So who is really the goat. Let the people love what they love don’t say someone is better than some ESPN. Your preference doesn’t mean you’re right and choose the right person/thing.
The ref was Argentinas best player
You cannot compare Messi and Christiano because one is a midfielder and other is a striker. The way they contribute to the team, is completely different.
greatest match in the history of world cup.messi is god.mbappe is next big thing and going to be goat very soon.
What makes you say Maradona is the greatest. Pele is the GOAT and he won 3 world cups, let that sink in. it's funny how people just dismiss that. Racism will destroy you. I thought we rate with statistics. the guy scored so many goals and won 3 world cups. How many world cups did Messi, Maradona won? Pele has more world cups than both Messi and Maradona combined
I'm a Ronaldo guy, but today cemented it for me. Messi is the GOAT.
Only idiots debate the "GOAT" you can't compare from different eras.
And Pele's name is not even in the title too? Laughable.
I want this question again for Shaka. Dude has been soo critical of Lionel Messi.
I think is about we wake up from our sleep, media is portraying one as a villian to get attention whiles both of them don't have problem with each other, we shouldn't follow that media much.
Alejandro Moreno trying to Craig burley in the beginning…
MESSI IS THE FIRST PLAYER IN SCORING IN GROUP PHASE, QUARTER FINALS, SEMIS, AND FINAL OF A WORLD CUP 🙌🏻 🐐
what makes Ronaldo NOT A GOAT?.3 so if messi didnt win WC he wudnt b a  Goat ? strps
Eclipses Maradona that's going abit too far Maradona went from barca to a struggling napoli and made them win Messi couldn't even come  to the toughest league in the world ppl are quick to forget the greats and what their accomplished media and fifa just shove Messi down ppls throats
Final so good ESPN had to bring Daniel Bryan in the podcast
Pele is the greatest ever no matter what these imbeciles want people to believe.   The only reason why anyone would say it isn't Pele has to do with recency bias. Heck even Maradona is greater than Messi. But this is the media for you. They want to control what
Can't wait for Shaka to finally say it!!!
He is right. 99.9% of Ronaldo Fans are confused and think Best Footballer of all time and best goalscorer of all time are the same thing. They aren't. It just happens to be that Messi is also the greatest scorer of all time... but thats besides the point. The things Messi is doing besides scoring goals that counts... his skill, his awareness, his football IQ, his assists, him making the difference and having the genius idea, his ball handling.... just about everything that makes a good footballer, messi is #1. Best offensive midfielder of all time, best playmaker of all time, most assists of all time, best goal scorer of all time.
I laughed at y’all , there’s no way he’s the greatest. Pelé is
My Goat ranking Pele(just feel obligated to)  Messi Maradona Ronaldo Cruyff Zidane  But all are great so shut the f up about goat debate football exists because these guys exist
At club and individual award level, Messi is far above Maradona, granted they couldn’t be awarded balon d’or nor golden boot, some analysts say he should’ve won at least 2 balon d’ors if it existed but still Messi’s career at Barca is out of this world compared to Diego’s. It’s not an insult to be second to Messi by all means
ESPN be smoking PP
Ahh so world cup is the difference. No matter the other trophies if you got a world cup you are set
ale crying
My Fitbit thought I was doing a workout, but I was just watching the game 😅
Awkward moment when Messi goes back to France. Are the french people gonna love him or hate him there after the World Cup?
I'm with Ale, who cares really about who is the GOAT, what does it add to our lives. They're both great footballers, let's just appreciate them both and how talented they are and what they have done over the years.
Messi=🐐
Mark ogden saying its disrespectful to say messi or ronaldo are better than Maradona or pele while disrespecting ronaldo every day for 2 years now is just pathetic and hypocritical
Messi is the one and only GOAT
The greatest ever final I have watched. Messi was outstanding. The grest goat🐐 indeed
This lad must have never seen how Chelsea played Messi, how Real Madrid played messi.  They all tried to break his legs. What’s he talking about?
Y'all gotta realize that Messi fans always said that the WC never makes a difference. They always argued the debate using his style of playing and his numbers. It was the haters who kept asking for a World Cup, so here it is.
I can't wait to hear Shaka's take on Messi finally winning the World Cup and being THE G.O.A.T of the Game Finally!!!!
I hate it when sports commentators pretend to be above the debates we know every football fan gets into. It doesn't make you look more intelligent or better than soccer fans. News flash it doesn't.  Messi has proved himself. You can't say you are the greatest without winning a World Cup. It's the pinnacle of football achievement! Messi proved his pedigree today! CR7 can present any accolade he has once Messi brings out that World Cup medal all the talk shuts down.
CRISTIANO RONALDO STILL REMAINS THE 🐐🐐🐐
Only fake childish football fans would ever compare CR7 and Messi . We all know how capable these two are and unique in different ways. We should just be grateful for to witness two LEGENDS PREFORM INFRONT OF OUR EYES
France made my day......
Stick to talking about basketball and baseball ESPN. You haven't got a clue.
Ale just dismissed ronaldo like he wasn't even a top 10 ever and this was just for a show and because they have nothing else to talk about. Ronaldo had a legitimate case and is a top 3 player ever. So i dont get how you can just dismiss his so easily like hes a nobody
I'm looking for Shaka Hislop to troll and tear apart
The GOAT debate between CR7 and Messi is now over. Messi is the GOAT.
Football is a team sport. No of ballondor or FIFA best player award settles the goat debate.  How can a team trophy settle individual battle .. No of ballon d or settles the debate.
Where is Shaka now??
Mbappe went in for his Country and got a Hat trick, that is an superhuman feat to do in Football! That man will be something incredible for the world to witness! Messi got his World Cup, incredible indeed. Mbappe got it already at 18 I think XD. So by standards He is better than Messi already XD
Mbappe is real goat. Like he was fighting alone in the ground ❤💝❤💝
It was a great game .  Even on the tactical side with the coaches.  A complete game by both teams
Then yall are diminishing what ronaldo did beside the big trophies. Yall just said comparing big trophies shouldn't be the standard and the criteria but that has literally been your criteria for years. Or is it just because messi doesn't have as many world cups as someone like pele but you want messi to be the best ever so you have to create some narrative that now you need to look at other things not just the big trophies. Yall are pathetic
Mark Ogden, stop being ridiculous…
World Cup has nothing to do with Goat debate nowadays,  Ronaldo is playing for PORTUGAL 🇵🇹.  World Cup is winned always by only 6-8 countries. If you are out of those countries then is very hard if not impossible to win World Cup. Also Messi didn't even carry Argentina, he was carried or better argentina as a team won it.
Common misconceptions. Messi win this world cup to cement his undisputed goat among the legends such as maradona and Brazil Ronaldo. His debate with Ronaldo is over long ago.please don't ever mention penaldo with Messi ever again. It's insulting to the 2022 new world champion :)
pls make a video appreicating Emi martinez. He saved Arg in 2014 semi, Copa semi,Worldcup quarter,now worlcup final
Ronaldo wasn't born in Brazil had he play for them things probably would have been different but he played for Portugal people who know Portugal wasn't going to win the World cup
One plays for one of the best teams in the world in Argentina and it took him 5 attempts to win finally. The other plays for Portugal. Not fair grounds. Commentators should stop this biased talk.
Forget the stats only 1 stat matters n Messi....just got that tally mark.... GOAT!!!!!
Why don't they mention mccoist in the same breath? Or is he that good it's cheat mode?
Messi is the reason Argentina won. They are at best average without him.
He is definitely better than Ronaldo and Maradonna but he is still on par with Pele. So, he is not the Goat yet.
You and I knows that Cristiano Ronaldo didn’t support Argentina 🇦🇷 to win the World Cup because of Lionel Messi.  God Almighty make’s Argentina 🇦🇷 to win this World Cup today so that the difference will be clear and of which the difference is clear now. Messi has won 7 Ballon D’or and I don’t see any reason or reasons for anyone to compare 5 Ballon d’or winner to 7 Ballon D’or winner. It’s good for us to be honest and the GOAT debate is over.
Terrible take CR7 the GOAT
Maradona will always be number 1. ☝️
GOAT debate ended in 2018. A rigged worldcup can't change facts.
W
Messi is now behind Pele. Cristiano is just the best forward of his era.
Greatest World Cup Final ever Vamos Leo🐐 Vamos Argentina 🇦🇷🇧🇩
Absolutely the best World Cup final in history.  Both teams completely deserved this, playing to win to the last available second! Both managers deserve praise for the courage of their game plans. Both teams played *so* well 😁  France came back *twice* in a World Cup final ffs. Just astounding.   I called Argentina to win at the beginning of the tournament but my heart wanted France. Injuries to 5 major players before it even started... injuries from the 1st minutes of the tournament... virus running through the squad in the days right before the final...  *and still they did not let us down!*   Congratulations Argentina!
Penaldo fans on suicide watch
He was already ahead of Ronaldo, but all the people saying "Maradona has a World Cup" to put him over Messi and finally accept that Messi is the one at the top
The problem with the World Cup argument is that success in the World Cup is heavily based on how good your national team is around you and players don't decide where they are born.  For example, a guy like Ronaldo or Lewandoski will always be held back by Portugal or Poland. If Ronaldo and Lewandowski were born in Argentina, Spain, or some other powerhouse do yall think that they couldn't have eventually won a World Cup?
Why do people always want to compare? Simple. It is because people always get excited about the winner! TO BE FAIR WITH BOTH PLAYERS, in terms of quality both Mbappe and Messi equally played very well in this Qatar WC 2022 Final. Both scored goals with a beautiful reading of the game, beautiful movement, and incredible very high skill. But, Messi won. And people gravitate to Messi. With the same quality and with the same criteria are given to Messi and Mbappe, how about if, in this World Cup Finale, Mbappe won the game and not Messi? What people's opinions would be?
The debate is over. Messi did this at 35. He was the best player on the pitch. And there’s a chance he coming back in 2026 👀👀
Messi is better than Cr7 but for me Pelé is still above him (as an originator) but Maradona is under him now. Still we have to respect everyone's opinion 🖐️
Don't let Mark back on this show🙄🙄🙄 idiot. No one is disrespecting anyone. He either doesn't listen or has no understanding of what Ale and the others said.
MESSI IS THE GOAT
Eres el mejor Leo! Dios te bendiga. Felicidades Argentina ❤
Still prefer Ronaldo personally but Messi is a joy to watch unbelievably gifted.
HE IS NOT THE G.O.A.T, ...ONLY ONE PLAYER CAN SAID THAT , AND HIS NAME IS   IL FENOMENO,BRAZILIAN  RONALDOOOOO
He’s not the best ever!.. but he is the best of his generation!
Messi probably the goat but mbappe is the current best player in the world
Messi has aced every format. League, champions league and now national tournaments(2 wc finals, 3 Copa finals). Don't forget that not only Messi beats all folks in longevity, but also consistency and peaks
Messi fan here but oh my that boy Mbappeeeee🔥 what a baller
WORST WORLD CUP EVER !!! FIFA MAFIA
Mr.. Mark I can show you 20 videos of Messi being kicked.
Ale Moreno is one of the best football analysts on TV, in my opinion. So passionate, knowledgeable and eloquent.
Ogden lowkey stupid for saying team trophies is what determines a player is the best ever
Who is that idiot talking about some other 10 players
The last guy spoke sense. Let's appreciate legends in every era and not diminish there contribution. In ours Messi since 2006 when I saw him play is the GOAT
Messi is fantastic! I’m happy he won. However, Argentina is NOTHING without Messi. This is why it took almost 40 years to win.
That save was the match defining moment in dying minutes of extra time martinez you beauty 💪
Ridiculous debate? Man yall need to stop disrespecting ronaldo. Why do we need to shoe horn him into this discussion? Are you serious? You said it like ronaldo is miles of messi and isnt even in the top 10 and that this debate was just something that popped up. Ronaldo had a legitimate case.
Messi is the Real G.O.A.T! He's proved it to the whole world
Goals, league titles, FA cups, champ lge winners, copa america, world cup & he's done it consistently since he was 19. Messi the greatest of the TV generation.  Pele, I can't say. Edit :. I forgot the Olympics
Diego Armando Maradona is God , Messi is only angel .
3 guy a clown. Pele Maradona good but they got kicked becase they played against farmers. Stfu
Pele could not keep up in today's football let alone in Europe. He played in Brazil, 10 forwards and 1 goalie.
Nah this is pointless cr7 was the best ST Messi was RW n Neymar LW no one can deny them at their prime is was over for any team people don’t get that Ronaldo work for it but age gets u all he did he has to adjust to different ways he can be at top level Messi yeah he trained but it was natural he was born with it yeah hard work beats talent but talents beats hard work over time happy I got to see this players as ya all should don’t be those kids that choose one side n start to hate on the other 6/9 are the same but opposite views 😉
messi proved his GOATness in a epic final what a story with a happy ending
Everything is fine we know that he is the goat and the question is who are these clowns to talk about the tick list of the GOAT 🐐 !?😂 Messi forever
No way...
It has been obvious since around 2010 that Messi is the greatest footballer the world has ever seen.
Everything Ronaldo achieved, he achieved all on his own. This is unlike Messi, who has been passionately supported by the entire Spanish/Latino world, including their referees, football administrators, and players. If Messi had faced the persecution Ronaldo has faced, Messi would have faded away long time ago. Players will kick and hold Ronaldo indiscriminately and the referees would ignore the fouls you touch Messi even lightly, he will fall and get a penalty awarded to him. His fellow Spanish players would harass and even attack any player who collides with Messi. This is why detached football purists like me see Ronaldo as better than Messi 👍
CR7 is the goat and the next goat is mbappe..that's it
Kobe game 7 vs celtics, this final are the best sports games ive ever seen
I Absosolutey  agree  Leo Messi is a Messiah  of football
Why is Ronaldo even compared to Messi…
Penaldo fans were insulting Messi the whole tournament. But in reality, it’s Pristiano pepa pignaldo merchant that’s finished. He will die without a World Cup trophy
Messi best player ever .....in what sports....better than pele and Maradona...you guys are very funny....stop joking about Messi best player ever
If you think that either Messi or Ronaldo are GOAT you are probably too young or have forgotten who was Maradona. No player ever comes close to him. He went to Napoli a no team and made them the Champion of Italy and Europe. They had never won anything before and after him. In Italy vs Argentina match WC 90 Italians in Napoli were cheering for Maradona. What he did with football was something that something that no player can ever do. His ball kick to the sky and controlling it in the same spot over and over.... Maradona is the GOAT.
Messi doing the deal right from the under 17 world cup, 2005,to the Olympics ,2008,to the  Copa America, 2021 and now the Fifa world cup,2022 for Argentina. Let's not forget he also loss in three finals(two Copa America and one world cup final). He's such an amazing player.
Lol just leave Cristiano alone lol no one has been on thier level for the past 15 years salute to both of them
Long time supporter of Ronaldo being the GOAT here… today I changed my mind it’s Messi.
I just wish Diego Maradona would have seen this Maradona-esque Messi this World Cup, Messi brought so much personality and Leadership in this world Cup, Truly sad
Take it easy CR7 will only retires with 41 yo.
Flo the click.....there you have it folks
Mbappe will never be the greatest because he is too lazy, he brings his privilege onto the pitch with him, “I’m the star, you all work for me”.
Imagine if Messi was on France… might have won 4 world cups by now (2006, 2014 for sure, 2018, 2022). Comparing him to Pele is unfair because Pele played for the most loaded team every time. Messi carried Argentina this year more than Maradona did in ‘86. For me, he was the greatest before this tournament.
Laughing my head off. GOAT. Cristiano Ronaldo. Successful in La Liga. Premiership. Series A. 3 Uefa championship league in a row. Meanwhile Messi? 1 team I only FC Barcelona. Joined the farmer league. 1 team winning the league title.
Messi is the goat. Messi  has no equal  .he has win  everything  .anyone can top Messi
Pelé Is The Goat #1 Messi is #2, Pelé won 3 World Cups, was the Athlete of the century over Muhhamad Ali, Jordan, Jesse Owens, Kareem Abdul, and was the player of the century over Maradona, Di Stefano, Puskás, Gerhard Müller, Cryuff, Beckenbauer
They didn't have Kante & Pogba. French mid was dead. But they duked it out. Well done Messi
Definitely Messi is the GOAT...he proved by winning the WC 2022.Ronaldo said 'I am the best player'...Messi never say..but the world know Messi is the best player and the GOAT of football
Pele greatest of his time.. Messi greatest of his time.. You can decide who is goat when world is going to end
Only the greatest can play in the greatest final of all time 🔥🔥🙏💯💯💯
Now its over messi is officially the 🐐  as a honest Maradona and ronaldo fan I wanted france to win but now that messi and argentina has won the world cup their is absolutely  no doubt  I have to accept and bow down to the greatest ever lionel andreas messi the 🐐
Messi 🐐💙❤️
Messi - He is a team player
Because Ronaldo always say I'm the best I think he deserves this now
Good game...I just wish FIFA would stop trying to influence the game. Bad call for the penalty shot, all these bad calls never go to VAR, why? And Messi is a great footballer but I’d take my Luka Modric over them all.
Argentina dominated till 80th min. only argentina 's own mistake caused this dragging into so much  tension
Maradona and Pele and Ronaldo Phenomeno are all better than Messi and CR7 and I would add prime Ronaldinho and Gerrincha in there too.  I'm so sick of these dumb "GOAT" talks like we didn't grow up watching a 19 year old Ronaldo do what Mbappe did today THEN
My Friends iam big c.ronaldo supporter. But even i must admit He has taken the goat Position. The debatte ist for me closed.
Was never a debate, every sport has it's forced PR rivalries. Leo is goated, on his own.
Imagine witnessing this in our lifetime . The greatest era of football and the greatest players of all time
There’s nothing disrespectful about saying messi is better & greater than past players, it just is what it is, there’s levels to everything, & Messi has surpassed anyone that’s ever played no debate
I think Messi failed to win u9 tournament and he can not be the best player in history.
No. He is only the 3rd best. He can never displace Pele and Maradona. Pele and Maradona did it when defenders could get away with grievous bodily harm. Messi has done it wrapped in cotton wool, protected and coddled by rule changes, and referees that act like children’s nannies.
Nah Ronaldo is the GOAT. International trophies are meaningless and that can't be argued because Pele has 3 and nobody cares. The Madrid UCL 3peat is the single greatest footballing achievement there has ever been. Along with dominating the most prestige's league in the world is what makes him GOAT.
I think the difference on Pele winning his three world cups, is that at least two of those, Brazil would have won without him on the roster. They were legends , each one
If France was at full strength with Benzema and Pogba, no way Argentina would've won. They lost one game in the group stage and consistently gave away sure leads. They are not a great team. Just fortunate in this WC. France and England were better teams.
So many siilarities between the final and the quarter final against Netherlands, the 2 nil up, the equalizing, the penalties. This one was ecstatic, breathtaking and a befitting final. In the end, the best team won the world cup.
Boohoo, Mark Ogden. It is not disrespectful to say Messi is the greatest of all time.
It's incredible to think that after his four final losses for Argentina, he's now been part of a side that has won three finals in a row since 2020. I really thought he was just cursed with bad luck at international level before Argentina won the Copa America in Brazil. As someone who's watched him since his debut for Barca, it's so pleasing to see him finish his career with those achievements, especially a world cup. To do that between the age of 33-35 just makes his legacy even more incredible.
For once I agree with Ale. Dumb conversation in the first place to compare the two. His whole take was great.
WHERE TF IS SHAKA LOL I need to hear him lol
Calm down guys false idols plus Ronaldo is better
That game was rigged. Corrupt ref
WHAT ABOUT PELE GOOFIES ?
ALE is right... It's ridiculous to even mention CR7 name here. The so call GOAT debate is over with. We won't even entertain it no more. Messi is the greatest the GOAT period.
You guys just hate Ronaldo… since the beginning
Maradona never won the Copa America Pele never played in Europe Ronaldo never won the Champions League Cryuff never won the World Cup Cristiano never won the World Cup  Messi won it all
Congratulations to Argentina n most of all Messi..Great game.
Messi equaled Mardona as best ever. We have two GOAT🇦🇷❤️🇦🇷
It took messi 5  world cups for him to win one and everyone is saying he's  the greatest  player  ever, Pele won 3 world cups  starting  at the age at 17year old . He's one of the greatest yes but not the greatest of all time.
can we all agree that Fox was NOT the GOAT of broadcasting this world cup
Ballon d'or loading..........
Messi will be uncomparble now as he bagged the world biggest title.
Save for the shock of the Saudi game which jolted everyone into action subsequently, Argentina has always looked resolute, even though not the most convincing at times. Respect Messi for his performance and respect Argentina for playing their hearts out. The debate will continue ironically because it’s always coming from different perspectives looking at different aspects of the game. For me, Messi will forever be part of football’s finest first eleven. As for the greatest, like it or not, I will reserve it for Diego Maradona.
top 3 of all time IMO: 1) Maradona 2) Messi  3) Pele   Key has no goddam clue so I'm glad Ale stopped the nonsense for good.
What kind of debate barely mentions Pele? Messi wins 1 of 4 World Cups (same as Maradona) whilst Pele wins 3 of 4 and Pele isn't even in the conversation? With all else being equal between Pele and Messi, Pele is the GOAT because of his World Cup record.
Goat Messi
mad salty mild hater
Messi arguably best passer ever, arguably best dribbler ever, arguably best goal scorer ever (91 goals in 1 year) and now has a world cup. Name me another footballer that ticks all those boxes. NONE. Debate over
All debate ends here.. he is the undisputed GOAT.
Ale gave a motivational speech
ESPN FC just can't stay away from Ronaldo, tell me you're a Ronaldo hater without telling me you're a Ronaldo hater 🤣 Argentina literally just won the WC a couple of hours ago and you still manage to involve Ronaldo in the conversation
Congratulations to Messi and the Argentina 🇦🇷 team. The deserve it. This was a team effort, beginning with the coach who was able to bring the best out of Messi when the elite coaches couldn’t do it in his prime.  What about the goalkeeper who was so superb in the tournament. If it wasn’t a a team sport then Kylian’s France wouldn’t have lost after scoring a hat trick. He needed the others to step up when it came to the shootouts.  Let’s not make it look like he single handed went and won it. Destiny had its part as well. Some of those things that were meant to be especially seeing how dreadful they were for most part of the second half yet they were still in the game.
He wins now let the debate begin...

People forget Ronaldo won euro cup
Messi was goat before world cup and until someone of the same caliba rises
Brits always have to go there don't they? As for Maradona - Messi has the far better goals/assist ratio per game than Maradona. Only old people who are butthurt cant be honest about it.
Ronaldo fans have nothing to do but to cry till death that ronaldo didn’t won world cup bur messi did😂😂❤
I think Cr7 fans knows Messi is the best. But they ll still be in denial. Its like a fetish.
Cr7 still goat 🐐
Best at scoring penalties
Get a grip at the last guy with the commentary. You have to be blind, foolist and plain stupid
Lionel Messi is Exceptional….❤ Vamosss Argentina 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
Best of this era. Maradona and Pele were the best of their eras.
Gratz Argentina and Messi 🐐🇦🇷 World Cup 😊  8TH Ballon Do’r 😮
Ronaldo is still the goat 🐐
The goat is a goat itself 🐐
I believe Messi is the goat but the disrespect that Ronaldo gets in this video is staggering. Ronaldo is one of the goats and he belongs in the convo. Really disappointing take from this guy
Glad Mark did the proper thing and set it all straight. Messi is the undisputed GOAT of the millennial generation and it's not even close now.
I think Mbappe was the best player in this tournament.
Ogden will find a way of getting united into every conversation.
Pele scored and won every final he played and his world cup goals no pens
Number one = Pelé. Tied for second: Maradona & Messi.
👑 Messi ❤️🐐❤️🐐 Love For the King 👑👑👑👑 Happy new Year🎇💫🌟God Bless
We've never approved keepers defenders midfield players i saw Argentina  🇦🇷 keeper winning the game but he is nothing then we compare Maradona to messi diego was a player maker
Messi is not di best in the world wat abbout ronaldinho and pele
Maradona is watching messi and finally being proud!!he showd leadership!!!finally!
I guess Messi's ONE world cup diminishes Pelé's THREE world cups I guess... Pelé the KING OF FOOTBALL ⚽  👑. Plus the fact Mbappe will be back once again with two more world cups in his prime and he has ONE world cup already.
Ronaldo is my goat call it wat u want people have there preference. Pele and maradona are still being called the greatest. Ronaldo the greatest gold scorer of all time
7 games 5 penalties, he so good.
Well done for both teams Argentina did it 2night however polish referee on the spot if you compare other games in WC
Im a ronaldo fan but messi just put it  all to rest....but mbappe win be better than them :)) second final at 23 and won one already
EZ
Naaa that game was rigged
WHEN IS MARK GOING TO GET HIS TEETHS FIXED THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY ATROCIOUS 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Can we agree this World Cup was fantastic and say thank you to Qatar 🇶🇦❤️
World cup was fixed. They favourited heavily argentina since the first match. They wanted messi to take the world and they pushed it to the limits, cause of revenues, moneys and advertising bussiness. The final was clearly an indication how france played a great football and how argentina played a dirty football with the referee on it.
mbappe is the best player in the world. messi deserved the world cup. messi is not the goat he is the best player of the last 20years.
Messiah gonna get Ballon d'or again 🐐❤️
Why he's the greatest?? Because he got a penalty every game??? Argentina didn't deserve the cup they got obviously help every game. FIFA is corrupt
Messi is the goat... Penaldo's freaks keep crying
this dude said he could relate to thing messi does on the field ahahahaha
Ronaldo  Brazilian  " phenomenon " should be considered the best player ever .
Debate is over.
ballon d'or incoming 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Messi the goat
WHAT A FINAL!  My 7-year-old son SALIH is small, but very fast, he plays like mini Messi. I hope he gets to fulfill his potential one day!. Check out his videos on my page!
Messi was the best player for 2 generations
Ale hit it on the head. Mark ogden still can't accept Messi is the best ever so Mark Ogde obviously doesn't have a clue. It's about what they do on the pitch
Mark ogden acting like messi wasn't kicked and battered his whole career
He's the G.O.A.T end of discussion
Yeah. When Mark talked, I stopped watching. He couldn't stop himself from ruining the moment. We're talking about achieving it all. None of those past players mentioned were able to do what Messi has achieved with his current career. I'm not talking about a single thing, I'm talking about everything he's achieved compared to each of the other players' eras.
No more debates - I love Ronaldo but Messi is the 🐐
Messi real goat
From legendary to immortal, ladies and gents, Lionel Messi👑🐐
Messi argentina 🇦🇷 ♥️
I'm a Ronaldo's fan but today i can deny: Messi is the Goat.
Messi, Pele, Maradona, R9, CR7, Ronaldinho, Zidane……….
Mark is the smartest analyst on this panel pay respect to the ones who done it before
Idk  how many trophies messi wins , to me CR7 is still , was , and forever be the 🐐 of football , I grew up watching him and nobody is going to change mind
Messi is a genius and having talant which cannot be explained (touched by God), same as Maradona. Let's not forget (and nobody mentions) that Maradona stopped playing because of taking drugs, so when did he start taking those before they catch him? Anyway a fact that after Maradona passing away, Messi finally could win it! Only one GOAT = Messi!
Corrupt player ever 🤣
Messi used steroids to grow
Mark Ogden really saying he can't call Messi the greatest ever because there's been guys like Zidane, Romario, George Best and George Weah who that would be disrespectful to 😂😂😂
that first penalty call was a joke🙄
My wife fell sick during the match... The match was so intense. Please pray for her
Maradona is still the best ever, watch his footage, the man is just out of this universe
Have been watching PSG, he's playing better than ever. He's not finished yet. Another ballon d'Or is to come yet.
What makes Messi the Greatest is his impact on achieving.He carries the team, discipline, the humbleness to stay low etc
We have seen a good sign from Mbappe as a rising star, but we are witnessing a GOAT that has stood on this big stage for 18years
There will never be a player better then MESSII
Now we can move on to the Haaland Mbappe debate
Maradona didn't play under VR.
Yesterday’s game between Mn Vikings Vs Colts was the best sports game ever, but this one is good one.
Zidane better than Messi?? How is that idiot
Could Maradona handball in VAR era?
Messi the most complete player ever Seven-time record winner of the prestigious Ballon d’Or, which is one of Messi’s Guinness World Records. He is the first footballer to be awarded the Laureus Award for Best Sportsman of the Year award. He has won TEN La Liga titles, FOUR UEFA Champions League titles, THREE fifa Club World Cup trophies, SEVEN Copa del Rey titles, THREE UEFA Super Cup titles, and SIX European Golden Shoe awards among many other accolades as a player for La Liga club Barcelona. He has also won the French league for PSG and Olympic gold in 2008  and the WORLD CUP 2022
We want Shaka! 😂
Who decide the GOAT. Y'all need to quit disrespecting players that invented agility and dribbling before all these players. For the youngsters do your research on Pele, Rossi, Falcao, Zico, Weah, Petit, Ronaldo (brazil), Rooney, Maradona, Rummenigge,Baggio,Henry list goes on . Messi is one of the best players
Messi is great  fair honest  team player really
1 word; wow the best game of football I’ve even watched and probably ever will
When we have to talk about individual glories then we do not have to touch tournament trophies. Because its not fair to the players who never had good teams. Cristiano for me the is the GREATEST EVER TO PLAY THE GAME for what he has done with that Portugal team over and over again. Not mentioning every record he broke.
Mbappe is the goat
Hats off and Congratulations to Messi greatest player of his era....but Diego Maradona is and will always be  the football God....R.I.P
The mystery is done and every answer was answered!!! MESSI IS BETTER THAN RONALDO!!!
Both brilliant football players and both miserable human beings for playing the Qatar world cup
Thank you for your analysis, Mark Ogden, that I agree with 100%👍👏
One of the best finals I’ve ever watched. Put me through rollercoaster of emotions but at the end, they WON.   I’ve watched a history being written in-front of me. Very happy for Leo and thank you for entertaining us Leo. You’re really a GOAT 🐐.
Not lots of people, you do..
How can you say best in history and you have never seen Pele play?
Personal preference doesn't make someone the "GOAT".  It comes down to individual skill and what you can contribute to teams. All the clueless clowns in the comments that just follow along with whatever these ESPN morons say, need to open your eyes. Messi winning the WC doesn't change anything. Especially when there's so much speculation about the referees and how Argentinian Officials were over the Portugal and other matches. No excuse for that. If you want to compare the two greatest players and figure out who the "GOAT" is, compare them at equal clubs. Messi would never have been able to make an impact on the same teams that Cristiano has, nor is he as versatile in as many aspects. He's good at what he does.  Actual experienced high level football players and Managers and anyone else with half a brain knows this.
Worldcup is not the difference, it should not be the difference. You are talking about an individual player, so how can we see trophies that the whole squad wins??? From that point of view its not Cristiano’s fault that he had team like Portugal in  4 Worldcups where he literally carried them all the time.
Why CR7 is GOAT because they still need CR7 to the conversation to prove Messi is better.
Thank You Messi for ending the debate 🐐
Messi is the real GOAT 🐐  No doubt 🤷‍♂️ King 👑 Leo Messi
Agree. Lets give him the respect as the GOAT of his generation but the game changes as time goes on and it’s hard to compare
This whole channel is biased towards messi from day one it’s absurd. Just suck him off at this point. No, I’m not a ronaldo fanboy as you might want to claim because I’m saying this. It’s just the media loves to throw shade at ronaldo every chance they get. Plus, this doesn’t end the debate, far from it. This is like saying dani alves is better than zidane because he won more. See, it makes no sense. Let it end by both of them being the best and that’s it.
There was never a debate but now it is CLEAR
I imagined they must have been so exhausted near the end of the 90 minutes. Alvarez and De Paul was great obviously but they cant outrun the france defenders. Argentina did a really good job defending against Mbappe when they gang up on him. And I think Argentina doesnt have as much depth as France in terms of substitutes, because the african players are so terrifyingly fast. Im afraid in the future the shorter players are gonna have less and less chance in the sport. But most importantly, I'm happy that Argentina and the goat finally lift the trophy. Much love to all football fans🤗♥️
Everything that the bald man said is true, but in no way is Messi the GOAT. That's only his opinion. Messi is considered one of the best players in recent history, but no where near Pele, Maradona, Ronaldo Nazario. Cristiano Ronaldo is the real GOAT, unfortunate that Portugal doesn't produce top notch players like France, Germany, Italy, Brazil or Argentina, otherwise CR7 could have been undisputedly the greatest of all time. Messi was given everything, spoon fed, raised and trained in Barcelona. Cristiano Ronaldo on the other-hand, has won everything by merit, hard work putting overtime to perfect his skill.
Me from the UK, remember Pele won 3 world cups, so how can Messi be best ever.
I don't if winning the World Cup this way makes you the best ever player. Objectively, any team could have won the tournament if they were allowed 1 dubious penalty per game 🤷‍♂️
Messi 🇦🇷 💪🏼 🇮🇳 m pappayi 🤭
One does not compare Zeus to Achilles.  They both mark time.
Stupid to say that, you can’t choose which country you play for. Argentina is a much bigger country than Portugal
Please bring Shaka on..😭🤲 we want to hear him say Messi is the Goat.😹🔥
Guys..messi won with mediocre teammates.
Cr7 always 🐐
If you want to know exactly what this game was like? Watch the last minute of extra time, both teams had a unbelievable chance to win the world cup but both goalkeepers stepped up, that last minute was breathtaking
Thank you Lionel Messi for bringing me so much joy for the last 15 years of my life. I love you. I really do.
Lol where is Shaka saying he has to win a World Cup. Nowhere else to hide
Lets not forget what maradona did for a failing poor midtable napoli. Messi and Maradona are both Aliens!
The debate was over after the 7th Ballon d'Or but now it is officially over. Even previous debate was about Leo Messi and Maradona not Ronaldo.
Wrong mark ...messi is the greatest to ever play the game
So what if Ronaldo gets 1 more chance and wins a world cup in2026 then debate again hahahah
MESSI IS NOT THE G.O.A.T. HE IS THE GODZILLA OF SOCCER.
Messi is the best player of his time, not the greatest of all time. The media is trying so hard to erase Pele as the greatest player of all time.
No one taking away from the past. But base on statistics alone. Messi is above them all. And the athletes today are more talented than the past. The greats will always be great but there is a new king.
Mbappe definitely taking the mantle for the next generation but Messi for sure is the Goat
When Ronaldo scored those big cl penalties ppl said messi can't handle those pressure penalties.... and then this wc happened lol
One of the best matches
What a game fr. Wow messi the greatest of all time
Debate over.
These old niggahs need to chill out Messi is the greatest out of any generation since football began he has the stats and the trophies athletes are at peak condition these days back in the day they were all drunks let’s chill it’s never been a debate 🇦🇷🐐
Messi is the goat 🐐
For me Cristiano is the Greatest ever to play the game. with or wihtout Worldcup. Messi is wonderful, amazing one of the GOats. but to me Cristiano is my pick over Messi all day long.
Maradona was a beast but I think, if messi played with 80s 90s defender he would have much better resumes and statistics
Great game and tournament from messi Great spirit from mbappe and Martinez Argentina players bleed for messi. Portugal players don’t have that drive. Only if they planned around Ronaldo could have made the difference. Still, Ronaldo is always one of the goats along messi maradona R9, Pele, zidane.
Ronaldo will still be the GOAT and go down to history as second Best GOAT and also Messi biggest and best Rival which we all can agree
Let's not forget Ronaldo and Portugal has won euro Cup and nations Cup
Such a beautiful end to Messis legacy. As African, I don’t like Argentina (they’re the racists of South America) but my admiration for Messi trumps that. Congratulations no. 10. ⚽️👑
The Greatest Final ever was won by 🇦🇷.   Messi >> CR7    There is no debate
Another ballon dor ⏳
I think honestly the reason they skip Pele in the debate is because deep inside we know that football in the 50’s sucked 😂
Where is Shaka? On a diving tour?
He is the best of his generation. True. Mbappe will be the best of his generation too. You can't say he is all time best. What have him done that Zidane and Ronaldo did not do.
Di maria carried the first half . Dude played so well
PSG won, 5 goals in the world cup final
Messi was the highest rated player in this World Cup. 8.3
Messi has settled the GOAT debate!
Personally I think Messi is the GOAT. He’s the better all around player and  teammate. His passing is superior compared to most modern strikers. He did everything in this Cup.  Goals, assists, PK, and clutch moments. GOAT
Maradona was the best ever! He did it at a time when there wasn't sport science, etc.
im with mark on this one .. its not fair for the greats before to compare its impossible .. the whole game changed but one this is for sure messi is the best player of this generation and this coming from a cr7 fan all my life .. and i dont care about stats or achievements i use my eyes and my heart to watch football not a piece of paper this is not mathematics ..
Messi 🐐 > Pele, Maradona, CR7… no question about it.
The thing is we all have our own opinion...  You keep your opinion to yourself and I kept mine..
The idea of debate being there is nonsense, i have seen a lot of people supporting France because they don't want Messi to win the World Cup in order to prove to their friends or another person near that CR7 is the best but if he is the best he could have been in the Final, what they can't get out of CR7 they want it from France, Messi got his talent and his Crown from God, while CR7 got his fame from  UEFA in order to challenge Messi
Mark talking about Maradona being the best of his generation which is factually correct   However being 87-89 John Barnes was neck and neck with him for being the best player in the world.   John also had to deal with the awful tackles Maradona had to deal with plus if you factor in the horrendous racism he had to deal with and he was still absolutely amazing.
Nonsense  I knew go ahead give Messi balloon like kylian did nothing  fixing game so that he could win wc but  #,CR7,the best you all are bias
0:27 exactly. Thank you Ale 👏👏👏
Messi is the Best Players of this era, hands down
Mbappe is better. It's obvious from watching the final.
What a game! Too much drama..finally Messi won.Thank God.
He has always been the goat
ESPN IS WORTHLESS NEVER MAKE ANY NEWS WITHOUT INCLUDING RONALDO
ale so salty abt ronaldo 😂😂. good thing ronaldo isint french or else ale would be devastated that he even made the finals let alone win it.
Where is Shaka? Lol
the best ever world cup final i have witnessed, so tense.Argentina was destined to win this, especially after that last minute chance for france.
Let's just pick our favourite and move on.... I originally preferred Maradona, after seeing new footage of Pele I'm not so sure.. Those 2 are still the 2 for me....... What we are seeing now is an emotional response to such a great sporting event... And we're having it just hours after the match.. Can't we just pick our fav, celebrate with Argentina and move the debate on......
Game was over until scaloni took Di Maria out. Dumb move but thank god Argentina 🇦🇷 won but they had to work hard for it
Where is shaka? Ask him is messi the goat or not?
Leo Messi the best player ever 🐐
No one beats R9 at his best
This Argentina has character which previous Argentina teams have not had  in previous world cups deserved winners messi always was the goat this now ends the  conversation
Debate finished....Messi all time greatest  player n no.1...Messi king of Football...Goat.
Mark ogden we know you love Ronaldo.sorry Messi is and forever will be the Goat.
Your only good as the team that surrounds you in all spirts
Wow that final really took years off my life. The up and down of emotions, and I'm usually pretty calm but by the end of 120th minute I was having horrible Higuain flashbacks and was ready to go bite into Lautaro, but DIBU!!! came through in the end
Ale Moreno says it best.
Messi fans IM SORRY FOR EVER SAYING CR was better, Messi is the Goat … please accept my apology
Pele is the Greatest that why the ppl dub him KING, Mess is the Best of his Generation..
Messi has completed football, shaka better admit it now.
Lol cr7 still the goat but great accomplishment for Messi!!
Messi has completed football.
Messi is not the greatest of all time , he is one of the greatest of all time , this Ale dude must be on crack, you have the nerve to pick Messi over Maradona and the great Pele lol , Pele who won 3 world cups lol stop this nonsense
Still Maradona for me
CR7
18/12/2022 has closed this debut
The moment ESPN have been waiting 🤦🏾
Pele is the greatest ever
ESPN hates CR7.
The best World Cup Final ever...🏆 Messi The GOAT
C R7 HELPS A  LOTS OF POOR KIDS AND FAMILY'S SYRIANS.. PALESTINIANS..   MESSI AND RONALDO BROUGHT  THEIR CARISMA TO SOCCER
The Whole World from Japan to Argentina are shouting his name Messi..... Messi..... Messi.... ✨⚡
Truthfully, to even say there is a debate is an insult to Messi. The absolute peak seasons of Ronaldo only just outshine Messi's average ones. In assists, goals, dribbles, decisive passes Messi is ahead of Ronaldo by a margin. In terms of the eye-test, he's also ahead.
Messi is now the best and the greatest ever player to ever grace this game simply unbelievable and sorry for Ronaldo he could and should have been there with Messi but after his unprofessional behavior  towards his club and his mates right before the World Cup is totally diminish his name at the end of his career..cry baby baby
Commm onnn....Ronaldo is not inconversation at all ...messi wothout world cup he is betetr than Rinaldo... He is the freatest player no doubt...
Yes it is over what a monster performance by Messi in this tournament
Messi sent ronaldo fans into hibernation
ronaldo will never be what messi is...ronaldo will never achieve what messi has...ronaldo is arrogance...while messi is pure confidence...ronaldo is still looking in the mirror admiring himself...while the rest of the world is admiring messi--the GOAT
This match just proved that Mbappe is the true goat
Everything says Messi is the best to ever do it stats trophies take your pick it don't matter if you still argue against it your a waste of oxygen
Messi king is king W CUP👑👑👑
Where is Shaka? He's hiding now?
What a pointless discussion
ESPN is pathetic, they use every chance they get to hate on Ronaldo
Hey does @Lmechegaray always look to the side?
I think Garay is on point.  Good analysis.
Even though i think messi is a great player I don’t think Messi is he best ever as even tho he has won a world cup he was had a better cast around him so he should have achieved more trophies in the international stage with what he had  If you going to rate someone greatness you will need to see what great things he has done with what they have   Maradona maximised his potential with what he had  Messi did not maximised with what he had  Sounds harsh but life is not fair when comparing legends
Messi is the GOAT🐐
Di Maria is under appreciated, he won messi the copa america and now the world cup. No one can match di maria and messi
Imagine being removed at half time or being made to sit on the bench. That's now how great players deserve to be treated. Unfair comparison!
Messi is the goat because he’s won the wc for Argentina and got them to a finals also.But that doesn’t make ronaldo any less of a player in terms of skills .he’s also a legend but his inability to take Portugal to a wc glory or a final sets Messi apart from ronaldo.
The goat debate is over. Is name is now Lionel goatsi 💯
I guess we can consider him the goat after fifa carried him to the finals. How many penalties did they get I forgot?
Mark Ogden can cry all he wants, I'm loving this
It was never a debate but this just put the nail in the coffin. Messi is the greatest footballer of all time.
I want Shaka’s opinion 😁🤭
Has Messi been sacked by PSG yet 😂😂
Well this is an admirable way to conclude the goat debate, but surely the mbappe era begins now🇫🇷❤️🐐
Messi has taken some rough tackles through his career and a lot of them happened in the copa America or against real Madrid just saying
Ronaldo vs Messi debate over!
This was THE BEST football match EVER.  1.Argentina vs France WC Final 2022 Italy vs Germany WC SF 1970 Liverpool vs Milan UCL Final 2005 United vs Bayern UCL Final 1999 Germany vs France WC SF 1982 Italy vs Brazil WC QF 1982 Argentina vs England WC WF 1986 France vs Brazil WC QF 1986 Germany vs Brazil WC SF 2014 BARCA vs PSG 2017  Liverpool vs Barcelona 2019 England vs Germany WC Final 1966 Germany vs Hungary WC Final 1954 Uruguay vs Brazil WC Final 1950 Brazil vs Italy WC Final 1970 Madrid vs Frankfurt UCL Final 1960 Benfica vs Madrid UCL Final 1962 Liverpool vs Alaves EL Final 2001 Netherlands vs Brazil WC SF 1974 City vs QPR League Decider 2012 Arsenal vs Liverpool League Decider 1989
This made no difference. There was never a genuine debate regarding Ronaldo
It was always going to be Messi I mean he's from Argentina, Ronaldo is from Portugal which doesn't have a great history of football expect 2016 Euros Argentina were already a powerhouse way before Messi was born that being said nobody dominated the game like Messi did his numbers are disgusting Messi GOAT🇦🇷🐐
Messi the greatest player ever ,what a way to end your world cup career, wiil miss him at the world cup🐐
It’s CRAZY that I consider Messi is a goat of footballer since 12 years ago and this world cup just a gift for us but a real gift is a Messi himself
Messi is Amazing!!!!!!!
Hater Messi!!!
It can only compare to the 50 over Cricket World Cup 2019
As a kid growing up in the 80s and 90s there were football greats but 2 names stood out amongst the Cruyffs, Beckenbauers, Eusebios of the footballing world and that was Pele and Maradona. Since then I think it's fair to put Zidane and R9 Ronaldo in that group and today Messi is up there with them.  What a privilege to witness this man's career. 👏
Messi and help from penaltys
This grandpa won the WC and best player of the tournament trophy at 35. Ridiculous
Maradona still the best
At 35 🙏🏾
Typical Englishman dry as ever the world is looking at how Messi is playing football and the amount of years at the top with consistency. All the players you mentioned wre great but they are not Messi
Messi his another story no more compilation Messi wth another players even cr7 his young..... Debate it's over now....
Not Messi, Mbappe is 🐐
Leave pendu out of the World Cup winner’s talk‼️
The 3rd Guy that just talk you talk anyhow when they were saying if Messi never win woke up it can't be the best footballer in the world are you where you were sleeping did Maradona win champions tell me all the telling which champions league tell me this guy is being brutalized is be destroyed with your world is not the best player if you come to a big match you don't show up now is the best and it will be the best ever for Easter football the town where Maradona was playing people never attack them in the feed people attack all these guys destroy their leg they are still playing for over 15 years how many years Maradona play football tell me Messi is the greatest of all
M&M..=  MESSI MARADONA..ARGENTINA IDOL
Shaka is very silent😂😂😂
Shaikh Messi 🐐 the King 👑
MESSI, the UNDISPUTED GOAT
Now that Messi won the WC, is the Best of history. Now on every argument comparing Messi to cr7 sounds so ridiculous. Not admitting that Messi is beyond cr7 now is so stupid, so ridiculous. It's about taste? Don't be ridiculous. Be human...
ESPN just love to bring up Ronaldo for everything 🤦🏻‍♂️ Messi won the WC but he is not the goat to everyone there’s way more things to debate but everyone has there opinion and that’s fine. World Cups are won by TEAM EFFORT  if anyone showed up to win something on he’s own today it was Mbappe with a hat trick and making he’s pk shot in the end…obviously this conversation  about Ronaldo and Messi was going to come up when Messi won WC but now the Messi fans can have something to bring up because they forever will bring up this one congrats to Argentina and Messi either way.👌🏻
Fantastic World cup Finals match.
Mbappe is better
Who is the best football player of all time ??? I think now, even Ronaldo will not denying this truth!!! It's Lionel Messi !!! Now there is nothing left messi didn't succeed !!! Bravo messi!!! Bravo Argentina!!!
Of course ESPN had to bring this divisive  topic. To divide people with hatred rather than letting people enjoy the beautiful moment united for once.
GOAT debate?? This debate is over long ago. Even without the world Cup, Messi is the greatest of all time. But some people kept raising the topic. Now it is done, dusted, buried. Messi is the GOAT
Messi did it 10 years in a row that’s unheard of. Save the argument, Messi records will never be touched. He surpasses all.
Messi is in the same sentence as Maradona and Pele.
Messi can't be the goat without winning the Europa league
Africa FC vs Argentina. What a match 🤣
Messi proved he's the greatest ever in the greatest world cup game ever
To me this world cup wasn't needed for Messi to be the GOAT He was in the debate at 23 now at 35 I just wanted him to win and have the happiness He deserves for the years He has made us so thrilled by the sport he deserves it absolute GOAT
What is Ronaldo doing in the conversation? Maradona, Pele, Messi were the three best players of all time before the tournament. He's simply not good enough individually compared to these three football geniuses, and Ronaldo winning World Cup wouldn't have changed that. I also think Messi's World Cup win changes nothing in terms of status. He was the GOAT before the tournament and he's the GOAT now too!
𝗠𝗘𝗦𝗦𝗜 𝗕𝗘𝗘𝗡 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗚𝗢𝗔𝗧! 𝗛𝗨𝗠𝗕𝗟𝗘 🤴🏆
How  could mbappe run with that speed even after playing for over 100+minutes ?
Did he just say"The ORIGINAL ronaldo"???
MESSI CAMPEON DEL MONDO 👍👍👍
When was zidanes  generation 2002 until like 2005 I'm sorry I like Zidane but he was not better than Ronaldo phenomeno or better than others George weah was amazing also
Ronaldo is still the best, it’s much easier to win the world cup with argentina
Messi has class on and off the pitch,.. can't say same for Maradona. As for Cristiano, he's a Soccer Karen, immature and an inflated head,.. come to think of it similar to many players out there....  Messi is GOAT !
Zidane won EVERYTHING too. Champions league, Euro, worldcup, Ballon d'or...so my list. 1. Maradona 2. Pele. 3. Messi. 4. Zidane. 5. Cr7
The debate is over, Messi won. Now for the next 15 years we can argue who's better out of Haaland and Mbappe. Mbappe for me.........
Ronaldo is clearly top 5 possibly top 3 don’t disrespect my guy
Q
Where is Shaka?????
No Pele,no Maradona won everything what was possible in fotbal game as made Lionel Messi he is bless special givted by Real God he is best in fotball history.
Pele will always be the goat
Give France credit, they had a ton of players Out injured, had players sick and overcome a Dubious call in the first half   What a game for the neutral
Please bring shaka...I want to see his face...lol
“Ronaldo just scores tap ins and penalties”
Are they mad. Media is too much stupid
Ofcourse he eclipses Ronaldo and others. But Maradona will still remain the God of football
Penalbappe??? In the same league as Messi and ronaldo lol. What a joke. The guy is 23 and lost to a 35 year old in 120 minutes lol.
Saka will say Messi is the GOAT 🐐 now
ESPN has always talked negative on Ronaldo
Pele...Maradona...George Best...Messi...  ...Let's go for a pint Boys and Germs?...
Messi is the goat
Its Mbappe and Haaland now.
He is not, Pele is then Maradona. He is good though and better than cr7.
This Ale Moreno doesn't know football (soccer).  Best in history??? Hahaha.  Ale, go study some history. Pele won 3 World Cups.
Martinez....save of the century
waiting for the shaka hislop take.
🐐👑🦁
The real GOAT 🐐🐐🐐  The world champion messi ❤️❤️❤️❤️  Finally Debate is over
mark ogden needs to get kicked out this espn crew, man is talking straight waffle
Messi is great, but the GOAT is still Pelé. 3 world cups. He was a complete player.
All the rules that regulate the game now a day were not in place when Pele or Maradona played. Therefore, Messi is best player for generations. Stop disrespecting the 🐐
It would have been fitting If it was 3-2 and messi would have got the winner
Mbappe will surpass both
RIGGED
Goat
GOAT SET AND MATCH 😎
Congrats Messi... respect to Maradona the God of football...Pele the King of Football....
Comring messi to bralian ronaldo and zidane 😂😂😂😂what a fool messi does things zidane the brazilan ronaldo could only dream of.
There will never be like messi and ronaldo ever,  messis talent from god and ronaldo hard work ❤️ respect to both of them
these people dont just rate ronaldo  if ronnie won the WC through this run like PENS this bald guy would say a lot of things... these are just haters..
Still Pele the GOAT
The debate is over ...... Messi is the GOAT.
Messi made the whole team better  CR7 is still on the bench
Please do not bring Ronaldo to this debate. He is very good but he is NOT one of the best ever.
MESSI is the Greatest of All Time and that debate was done today
CR7 is still on the bench
So once again Di Maria gets no credit. That whole left side of Argentina is what put them in front in the first place. Di Maria creates the first penelty and scores the 2nd goal. France got their tactics wrong and corrected that by the end of the first half. Messi is the best player of his generation but it stops there imo. Messi almost lost the game for his team by giving it away multiple times and on one of those bad giveaways france scored. Theo had him compeltly locked down and was subbed off. To be best of all time it would require something crazy like doing back flips and scoring for every goal otherwise you can only go generation by generation bc the game is always changing. Pele won 3 world cups so what is the marker really other than feeling and emotions? Brazil had great teams and Argentina had a very strong team this tournament. Credit to all of Argentina for a wonderful tournament. They could win Copa America again in this form.
Messis a legend, but I still prefer prime cr7.
What s load of bullsh*t, he isn't the best of his generation just because he won the world cup. It's not clear cut between him and CR7. It still is s matter of preference, no absolutes here, I'm sorry
Messi ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Congratulations 🎊  Messi and Argentina 🇦🇷 🏆🇦🇷 , thanks for everything 🩵🩵🩵
Glad Romario got a mention!
Greatest penalty taker maybe
Pele is the BEST of the last century. Messi the BEST of this century.  Messi's world cups (1) Pele's world cups (3)  Well best of all time taking world cup titles...ehhmmm NO. But individual, it's impossible to compare, period!
Ballon d or to messi 9th incoming
Maradona Hand of god
what debate?
"Disrespectful"??? Why do people like Mark this it's somehow disrespectful to compare players? Is it disrespectful to France, Croatia or Morocco to say Argetina was thr best team of the 2022 WC? NO.  Players play for the trophies, success and the opportunity to be considered the best. It doesn't dishonor any player to simply think that one was the greatest.   Also. Mark says that Messi didn't face the physicality Maradona had to. Yes and no.. because on the flip side, the pound for pound athleticism and training advantages of Messi's competition today has evolved past the great players of yesterday. And players like Messi have to fight harder to stay fit since the greed of the sport has created non stop, world class competition all year round. Messi being Argentina's centerpiece despite his age and the level of competition actually gives him the advantage if we are comparing the physical toll of the game vs Maradona
Messi is best player of the planet
Mark Ogden, typical United fan, explaining about generations, messi has been the best player in the world for nearly 15 years. He's won 7 ballon d'or, there hasn't been another player who's played at this incredible high level for so long. Who has won so much, the greatest player ever. There's not a question, incredible. We just witnessed history, vamos Argentina 🇦🇷
What a beautiful game was today  Congratulations Argentina 🇦🇷 my favorite team since 1978  I watched from Hawaiian islands 🏝  Bravo Argentina 🇦🇷 wins the world 🌎 cup 2022
In 100 years if the planet still exist, Messi will not be remembered as the best player ever as you guys try so hard to forget O rey Pele as the greatest  football player ever. Everything that Messi, Maradona, Ronaldo, Cruyff, Ronaldinho etc... do or has done with a ball, Pele did it before all of them.
Messi Plays with argentine a team with a Big history of winning the World cup while Ronaldo Plays for Portugal who is literally incomparable.
Feeling So happy for leo messi Because he is one of the greatest player in the history of football and he is magician and my 2nd favourite...  But no matter what happened today...  The Greatest there is The Greatest there was and  The Greatest there ever will be is Cristiano Ronaldo ♥️  The debate once and for all  Cristiano Ronaldo is the 🐐
whosoever brining mbappe in line with maradona ,pele, messi and ronaldo is dumb, just like this women, out of all the things to talk you crackpot talking about ninja turtle 😂😂
Who still think Messi is not better than Ronaldo? Lmao 😂
It's been lost to time, but Pelé is the only footballer to have had Messi's skillset and Ronaldo's aerial ability. He had a 48 inch vertical - litetally equal to that of Michael Jordan, and used it to devastating effect.
Messi and Ronaldo are the GOATS
Ale Moreno analysis is always on point.  Even before the World Cup Messi has always been the goat to me because of how he plays. Ronaldo will always still be an Elite Player
bro its simple maradonna is the boomer goat lol messi is the current gen goat and mbappe and haaland are baby goats in training not hard
Ronaldo become Arrogant, Messi is humble,. Mbappe is a Superman.
WAS NEVER A DEBATE. MESSSSSSSSSSSIII 🏆😂🐐😂🐐😂🐐😂🐐😂🐐😂🐐😂🐐😂🐐😂😂🐐😂🐐😂🐐😂🐐😂🐐😂🐐😂🐐😂🐐😂🐐😂🐐🐐😂😂😂🐐😂🐐😂 KEEP TALKING WEAK CRYNALDO DOGS LET ALL THOSE TEARS OUT 😗😘😗😗😘😘😗👂👂👂👂👂👂👂👂👂👂
Messi the 🐐 but the bald ale guy needs to start respecting cristiano Ronaldo more.
🔥Argentina🔥 france was sooooo lucky !!!!  1)first penatly for france not deserved 2) Argentina messed so many clear goal chances 3) 2 penalty  but last penalty was lucky one hand ball  !!!!
France was despicable. Not even a debate!
ESPN RATS just like FIFA, carrying RATS to win the world cup
The Messi vs. Ronaldo debate was fully settled on this day in sports December 18, 2022.
Can we stop with the mbappe goat conversation? Beside the wc he has nothing to show . Not hating he’s splendid as a player but as a fan , it’s annoying
Ale is on point here Messi is 🐐
Zidane wasn't the best of his generation. Ronaldinho was the best at that time
It's a sport and winning is part of it, yes messi needed it the world cup to be crowned the greatest
Tired of bias man. Every country in s america supports argentina more than brazil its pathetic. Yall hate us because we are the best team on the continent REGARDLESS of losing this wc, last time i checked we on 5. 5 more than any other teams in s america besides argentina or uruguay. Sad seeing they never support us and cling onto Argentina like its a win for them
mbappe is a baby goat for sure like goat of the new generation so far its him vs haaland imo mbappe showing his class i dont like madrid but i wish he made that move tbh he'd be the biggest name in football
I don't know what we did to deserve Messi. The earth is 4 billion years old and we exist in Messi's era. Some of you won't believe me now but in the future you'll realize what a blessing this is.
Argentina keeper won the World Cup, not Messi
He's good but Maradona was on another level completely, remember when he went to unfashionable Napoli & won them there first ever scudetto ⚽️🏃‍♂️
Almost heart attack today holy shot best match of all years
Of course this is the end of the goat debate !
Why has there to be a debate? Yes, why indeed? Because people have Personal preferance, Taste, likes and dislikes and although objectivly it was always ibvious that messi is the best, people kept this debate alive with stupid arguments like "has proven himself in different leauges", etc. So there had to be Something big in favor of messi to shut those Media / Marketing drivern pushers up. And this happened now with a World cup and copa America. Anyone who still disputes messi, is just blind or dumb or ignorant or whatever
This is literally the greatest story of any player in the history of football
PELE is the KING! Better than Messi.
No need to have conversation about whos better player anymore. The Answer is Messi  Now Messi will record the most goals in history. Ronaldo will be retired
Where’s Jules ?
YO MESSI IS HERE ,HE GOT THE WORLD CUP .
Best football final match ever. Certainly Best WC final ever. Big up to Messi and Mbappe, and as well as other players of both teams. So happy for Messi to have capped off his amazing career in such dramatic style. But honorable mention to Kylian Mbappe once again. What a courageous young man. 3 pressure penalties in a final and he put all 3 away as kool calm and collected . Wow 😲. The bravery  !!. And he stepped up to take that 1st penalty in the shoot out 🫡 . Big up Messi also stepping up to take the 1st for his country too. 2 great players.
Everyday before the world cup since 2014:  "Messi is nothing if he doesn't win the world cup" -Ale After World Cup: "Why are people even having this debate?" - Ale Me: 🙄
Ale Moreno speaks to my mind what an depth analysis of the game ... Hats off to the ESPN fc team as well 👏👌
Messi is the goat
Dont even try to compare messi with ronaldo. Messi is the best player of all time.   1. Messi 🇦🇷 2. Pele 🇧🇷 3. Maradona 🇦🇷 4. Cristiano Ronaldo 🇵🇹 5. Ronaldo 🇧🇷
Pele 🐐
cant wait to hear Shaka
MARK OGDEN IS A CLOWN 🤡 MESSI IS THE GOAT 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
CR7💯
LEO  THE GOOOOAAAAATTTTT !!!! 🔥🔥🔥🏆😂😂🙌
Maradona hacked, Messi got every minute of his career studied and mapped out with computer systems, peak athletics stars trained in every aspect to stop him and couldn’t. The modern game is a different beast, someone of Maradona‘s ill discipline wouldn’t have made it
How is Ronaldo even in this sentence? Brazilian Ronaldo was 100 times more technically skilled and than this guy. He is not even top 50 players in terms of technical ability in the 21st century.
Had to put Cristiano on the thumbnail 💀💀
It’s over
Pelé. Please.
The greatest debate that never existed is now over .... 😂🤣😂
Football at its purest
The reality is there was never a debate with Messi
Ridiculous to compare Ronaldo to Messi? Ale! Come on! How much disrespect does Ronaldo deserve?
It is finished. With all the discussions, heated debates with friends, family and online communities, commentary, pundits, football talk shows and events, we can finally say Messi is indeed the GOAT. We have been fortunate to be treated to almost 2 decades of unrivaled footballing art from these two, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, Strength and Skill, Power and Technique, Hard work and Belief. I am sure there will still be discussions but not at the intensity it once was, may we put this one to rest. Who will be the GOAT in our children's generation? it is their turn now. Take nothing away from C. Ronaldo, still remains one of the greatest ever, tought us all a lesson in hard work and sacrifice. Congratulations to Lionel Messi, the GOAT! It Is Finished. It is done.
He’s the goat Ronaldo is a close second both amazing but messi did the mic 🎤 drop
Messi is the greatest of them all!!! No lebron,no jordan,no brady!! This man is the BEST!!
Stop the comparison.
Ogden.. LOL… not much cognitive or intelligence can be expected from a Man U fan boy
It's also fair not t compare Messi and Ronaldo since they are two different people, their strength is different but both best
Ask Shaka Hislop what's he thinking now about "La Pulga"...
Where is xhaka am waiting for him to come and talk
Pele is the greatest player ever on this Planet and yall know it!!! Stop being delusional!!!
now Ronaldo fanboys support this money turtle because their idol is levels behind true Goat xd👍
Thank you Mark Odgen for having the level head and objective of the GOAT DEBATE. He's the best of his generation and one of the greats
What is Mark talking about? The doubters usually go in different direction and provide an analysis that is off subject. Bringing George Best in the conversation. What’s wrong mate?
CR7 doesn’t need to win a WC to be called the GOAT .
GREATEST WORLD CUP MATCH EVER IN MY OPINION. IT IS SURELY THE GREATEST MATCH I HAVE EVER WATCHED IN MY LIFE. THERE IS ONLY A 🐐 NOW , NO DEBATE ANYMORE. THERE ARE MANY SUPERNATURAL LEGENDS LIKE MARADONA , PELE , CR7 , BUT A PLAYER STAND OUT FROM THEM FOREVER , THAT'S LIONEL MESSI , THE REAL AND ONE AND ONLY 🐐.  THE GREATEST EVER TO GRACE THE GREATEST SPORT IN THE GREATEST ERA WITH THE GREATEST RIVAL........
Once a goat always a goat🇦🇷🐐🔟⚽🔥❤️💪🏆🥇👏🥺
IF YOU WATCHED LA LIGA AND COPA, YOU WOULD SEE MESSI IS KICKED OFF THE PITCH.
Hate from espn to ronaldo is unreal , GOAT forever, nothing changes for me.yeah I respect messi he is the GOAT.but you can’t hate ronaldo this much he has done so much for football
The Ronaldo fanboys must be crying 🤣
Both goats be happy they even played will miss them when they retire
The best player ever is Pelé
As a Ronaldo fan am happy for Messi, but involving the Ronaldo Messi debate is unnecessary not need to rub it on Ronaldo fans football changes each year remember that
'the goat winning in the goat land'                                     - Sheikh Messi
Always ronaldo🧡🧡🧡
Messi is the goat no questions asked. He is just amazing nobody can compare anyone to him even before this world cup win he was the greatest. This has just cemented it even more then it already is. :)
Messi🐐
Messi Is the best ever
He did it, he stood up when they needed him the most. He carried it home. The man wrote history he became a legend. The greatest of all time. He deserved this so much.
Mark Ogden certainly doesn't understand football 🤣🤣
Cr7 must be fuming ..
No one seeing the age gap between messi and cr7 Ronaldo has carry Portugal and everyone knows that Portugal without Ronaldo will never come into top ten cr7 is 37 and messi is 35  Ronaldo was the beast at the age of 35 go and watch Juventus match
I haven’t been a Messi fan for as long as some as I fell out of love for football when I was bullied out of my local team. Although I have been a messi fan since I started watching again. I had the Barcalona Messi 2011/12 kit and he was one of the only reasons I watched football again although I was a Chelsea fan. Messi has completed football now and I’m happy for him.
Messi has Proven It is Leo Messi THE G. O. A. T ❤❤❤
Not even best player today. Mbappe was better! But no one comes close to Maradona
Now Messi is not just greater than Ronaldo but he has become greater than Pele and Maradona. Because with the kind of technology and fitness we have in present time, It's not easy to be so consistent. Hats off to Leo. 🙏
🎶  Oh Shaaakaaa... 🎶
In your dreams yes...every game he becomes a penalty and plus a dresscode after win..this was make before the wc
what a finale..Mbappe single person scored agst argentina to make a draw...game was fair enough but little tension after 3-3 being a huge Messi fan but there was never a doubt today..and finally Team Argentina proved once again 2022 world cup belongs to only them and made it happen for them and specially for MESSI as they said...Huge huge Congratulations to all Argentine and Messi fan ...Only love and respect from Nepal
There are two player one is messi and other is players
Mbappe isn’t close. Don’t even bring him up with goat talk Murray.
Fck of haters..it's Messi messi!!!
Why is Pele barely mentioned at all?
@leachegaray- well said as well
Cristiano Ronaldo still number 1.
hehehehehehehe
The goat debate ended in 2019, when ronaldo 4 UCL and were top scorer in all of them in 5 years, the goat debate ended when ronaldo won 3 peat UCL.. It’s over when ronaldo won the euro and Europe natation.. The goat debate is over for certain base, but for certain base it’s over 2019… Just like that..😊
Camavinga needs to be investigated on why magic happens when he comes off the bench... Doesn't matter if he plays well or not, just sub him in when everything is going wrong and witness instant impact!!!
Only for those who truly understand football, it will always be Zidane.
Argentina have 4 times the population of Portugal and have won the world cup 2 times before messi. Portugal have never even reached a final. Such un unfair comparison.
Now wat will you do ESPN? Is your life over? kkkk
He kept coming back for the pain😐😐 Perfect lines
Ronaldo is kicked out of man u and portugal team..messi wins world cup...Ronaldo is gutted nd no GOAT.
Not Valentino Rossi Not Sir Lewis Hamilton Not Ayrton Senna Not Michael Jordan Not AB Villers Not Michael Schumacher Not Roger Federer Not Juan Manuel Fangio Not Carlos Reutemann Not Usain Bolt Not even other sports' legends  Lionel Messi is the only Greatest Athlete of All Time.  And as a non-football fans, I admit defeat, but at least their legacies won't be stained by him.
But why is the dude so salty
For the views..someone finally said it
This man Messi is just out of this world .... Hes just proven lots of people wrong
Joy of football leo messi
Im smelling a HBO special documentary for Messi 20 years of finally achieving  the final treasurer.
Mark Ogden’s initial take is STUPID.. Saying Messi wasn’t kicked and didn’t have to play in a physical game.. Did he just start watching the game the last 5 years? Messi was kicked CONSTANTLY throughout his whole career.. More during his earlier years 18-26/27.. So that take was REALLY REALLY stupid..
Shaka: well Messi has to lay an egg now to be the goat
What an analysis by Ale mareno.. pinpoint
Lionel Messi is the goat
So who is now best player of course Messi
Yes Messi is better than Maradona and Ronaldo. But Pele still has 3 world cups and can still claim to be the GOAT.
Messi n Ronaldo debate will not be over but plzz don't compare this mbappe to Messi n Ronaldo he cannot carry a team he got a lot of good players with him likes of kolo muani, Griezmann rabiot n list goes on n a solid defence. France would have lost to England if Kane hasn't missed from penalty... Messi carried Argentina 2014 2018 n now finally 2022 champion.. mbappe no close to Messi
Ale and the Media Mispronouncing Ronaldo’s name all these years really bothers me. Not just Home either. It’s a lot of Brazilian and Portuguese players names as well
Maradona as a sanctuary. For C. sake. Nobody will be beond it.
Leo the greatest of all time.. Congratulations
Ale jus nailed it… and also a fruitful answer to those asking for the world cup to cement the legacy of Messi. Where is Shaka by the way? 🤨
Don’t ever compare them again no one is better than the other they both achieved massive achievements throughout their career for club and country stop hating. Enjoy the era while we still can 🙏
Ale Moreno doesn’t like Argentina naturally and is lowkey a C. ronaldo fan.
Brawo Messi Brawo Argentyna! Polska trzymała kciuki👏👏👏🇵🇱🇦🇷
Ronaldo is still my Goat, I do not care if Messi has 2 world cups. Ronaldo>>>>>>>> I ain't switching.
I would say that R9 was the best in his generation and not Zidane.
Grande Ale. ¡Excelente análisis!
Merci DD 🇨🇵👍, vive la France !
I think celebrating Messi world cup should not come with disregard of Ronaldo... We might not see him play for Portugal. Messi can still play another one . 🙏🙏
He is the greatest Argentinean player ever, yes. But not the greatest ever.
I thought people called Ronaldo Penaldo. But most of Messi's goals were penalties?
Congratulations Qatar…. Messi 🐐
I will say luck was on missis side today 👍❤⚽🏆.. Mbapee was like a nightmare to Argentina... In last 10 minutes.
Last year not the goat this year the only one Goat MARADONA..... FINAL
I do not believe winning the world cup solidifies a player as the greatest of all time. We can one day get a player who is born in some country that is thousands of years from winning the world cup who preforms better than Ronaldo and Messi in the champions league and their respective league. The Champions League is the greatest stage of them all, not a tournament where players in a team have barely any chemistry and your success is determined by whether or not you were lucky enough to be born in a country where it's a power house in football/soccer.
Eight th ballon d'or loading........
yes, unnecessary conversation.
Football would be boring if only messi was there and no cristiano  I mean less entertaining for us
no debate right now mbappe is the better player whether people love or hate him. man just played 2 wc and scored already 12 goals and scored a hat trick in a final. 20 years of watching football can't recall a hat trick in wc final.  in wc history kylian already achieved more than messi no debate
Ale well said. Very honest and fair opinion
ESPN being ESPN
4 idiots
What a game. The greatest final I’ve watched. I love Ronaldo, but this night has settled it for me, once and for all.
Both teams deserved the victory. There really wasn't a loser in this game. That said, as soon as it went to penalties, Argentina was going to win the shootout.
Messi 🐐
nvm Cristiano Ronaldo, e sstill best to many people and will stay.
Messi best player in history of the game? After he won his first and last world cup? Lol. Pele eclipses all. Look at the stats.
Please don't compare the incomparable messi-Ronaldo.
Lionel Messi 🇦🇷 GOAT
Greatest game ever .
Obviously,this final is one of the best final ever seen, what a beautiful game 🤗🤗, congratulations to Messi and his team mates 🙏🇦🇷🇦🇷
I think Mbappe will become better than both Messi and CR7 in next decade if he wins 2 world cups, has more goals than both and has most goals in WC history
Messi is the goat now - UNDISPUTEDLY.  Shoutout to Emi asw, when he saved that last second shot with his foot to stop it going 4-3… then he won another Penalty shootout… Legend   MESSI IS THE GREATEST TO EVER KICK A BALL AND I’M BLESSED AND GRATEFUL TO HAVE WITNESSED THIS GAME AND THIS MAN - not just today but years of my life
Lionel Messi the most humble person in football has achieved his ultimate goal......WELL DONE
Why is Emiliano Marinez the unsung hero
CALM DOWN Only way Pessi wins…  NO BENZEMA  NO NKUNKU NO POGBA NO KANTÉ NO KIMPEMBE NO HERNÁNDEZ  Pessi with FOUR penalties this World Cup?  Ridiculous
Coming from biased ESPN... is this even news?! ESPN has always cheered for Messi... no matter what! LOL
I’ve always been team Ronaldo, and I have to now admit that Messi is the 🐐 😢
Mbappe can easily surpass Messi.
Messi is a very "balanced" player that makes him above most of the players in modern football...
Taking an average team to the world cup final and winning it against one of the best team in the world is an incredible achievement.🇦🇷🔥
No, e won and conratz but to me, e is not.
Comparing two players from different generations is just stupid. Everyone has talent and style and achievements ..
0:26 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Exactly!!!
Many people in China regard Argentina as their national team, and they are moved to tears for Argentina's dream of the World Cup tonight.
Nobody ever asked for Ronaldo to win smthing with Portugal. NEVER. All they ever said was "plzzzzzzzz I am on my knees begging you master, when u talk about Messi plzzzz master bring up Ronaldo too, plzzzzzzz"
GOG - greatest of a generation. End of debate
Messi had I believe 7 goals if 12 come from penalties nothing impressive mbappe is the real goat just needs a champions league
the last guy is just trying to sound smart, not working though
Mark actually makes sense
🏳️‍🌈1-3🇳🇱 soccer 🤡
debate is over
There was never a Goat debate with ronaldo to begin with, it was always forced to throat. Ronaldo should have be respected and cheered for being an extraordinary goal scorer. Comapring him with messi was just pure stupidity at every level. Messi as as good or even better goalscorer and along side the best playmaker ever. This is like comparing 5 to 10 and saying 5 is more than 10. Never have in my life i have seen more stupidity than this comparison.
For me the best player ever was Ronaldo.  And not the Portuguese one.  Messi and Pele are somewhat on a par for me in second place.  No one excited or made a difference like OG Ronaldo.  Also feel George Best not mentioned enough.  Cristiano not even top 5 really if we’re honest.
Messi is the GOAT 🐐, and no one is taking away the respect others great players. MESSi is just the greatest of the greatest.
Messi is best of all...
A legitimate organisation that is trying to help construction workers in Qatar is... Equidem  .............     .........................   ........  .....   Football fans should try and help the mistreated workers who built the stadiums and hotels.
No one say, but you only said.
Today you're forgotten Cris but I know that one Day God will award your All life fight 🐐
Absolutely the greatest ever!
In the National team: Messi is equal to Maradona now In the UCL/club football: Messi is miles ahead of Maradona..  Messi is the best player of all time. Maradona is the most magical player of all time.
Ale Moreno, the greatest player of all time!
Pelé and Messi .
The worst game from a neutral perspective.  3 penalties, overtime, garbage referring... I've watched 40 years the world cup finals,  Never seen 3 penalties given,Never  How is this the best game????
Messi the undisputed king of football- CR7 fans bow down to messi’s greatness
Messi eclipses ronaldo and Maradona. Ronaldo for sure. If you use stats, messi over Maradona, but if you are consistent and use stats, Pele over all.
You can say Messi is the goat and that’s fine but winning the World Cup doesn’t automatically make him the GOAT. Ronaldo has never had the same talent around him with Portugal as Messi has had at Argentina. I mean in recent years Argentina have benched or not selected players such as Lisandro and Lautaro Martinez, Dybala, Aguero, and Icardi who Portugal would have started in a heartbeat
Camavinga should have come on for Touachemi or Rabiot Real Madrid style. He was wasted. Even at left back he was very effective. He glides.
Shame on Fox Sports for not showing the World Cup trophy celebration by switching to a regular NFL game. Football is the most popular sport in the world but I guess money talks here in the US. Thank GOD for YouTube that showed it! Thank you YouTube! You rock! Viva ARGENTINA!!! Viva MESSI!!!
Ronaldinho.
If you're going to say Maradona had it tougher because of the brutal tackles, don't you have to admit Messi has more tactical defences to face?
Thank u jesus ❤️❤️
Penalty after penalty if this was Ronaldo … whole World Cup was rigged for messi
Messi never compared to Ronaldo. Messi phenomenal player. We're Lucky to watching Messi playing. Ronaldo top scorer like Pele, Halland and Alan Sherer. Messi, Maradona, Ronaldinho and Zidane all time best footballers. Messi naturally gifted Player.
GOAT DEBATE IS OVER WEEK ago mate
I can't wait to hear what Shaka has to say now 😂 😂
For me, it’s never been a debate between Messi and Ronaldo.  Ronaldo fans lay out STATs to show how great he is but Meesi fans lay out actual PERFORMANCES to show how great he is. That’s the difference between the two, period. Messi is the GOAT.
the GOAT debate was a fabricated clickbaity thing from media just to get eyeballs. it was never there. messi was the GOAT. anyway my favourite player was iniesta.
Bring on shaka already, I'm dying to hear what he has to say
SHAKA HISLOP ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!
Messi scored all 5 penalties he got in World cup Knockout stage . 🐐 He stepped up big times
Well I'm a ronaldo fan and all I can say is messi is the goat and ronaldo is in the top 10 not even in the top 5
Goat undoubtedly
messi is the best GOAT, from Hong Kong
Sir, Messi is Best of all Generations. Messi is Football and Football is Messi no doubt in my mind. Love from Pakistan to Messi and Argentina. Bravo
It was never a debate
Yawn.  It was never between these two in my opinion.  R9.  There’s a reason he was known as The Phenomenon.    Not about what a player achieves, it’s what a player can do with a football at his feet.  Ronaldinho was also ridiculous.
Please don't ask something that isn't there. This is specifically professional. The funniest finale of all time. Tonight Argentina silenced the entire population of Germany, Spain, Holland, England, Portugal and France. "Where is Messi" Still can't see it? Or need a magnifying glass? The beginning is not the end, but at the end don't ask what isn't there🤣 Leo Messi "The Real Goat 🐐"
I disagree with the pundits saying Messi is the greatest of all time. If you watch videos of PELE and what he did with Brazil 🇧🇷, I don’t think we should disrespect his hard work and change he brought to the game. Messi is not the greatest of all time period.
CR7 about to commit suicide!
Again a free penalty when it's 0-0 this is unbelievable
Remember the name pele don't be stupid messi never gone be the best
Funny how toxic messi fans are, now they are saying messi is the goat because he won a world cup? So, if we use that logic more world cups equals more goat? If thats the case then pele has 3 world cups, even ousmane dembele has a world cup, the world cup is a team trophy thats all it does not prove anything.
Enzo Fernandez is A player Barcelona should go all out ...He has to play for Barca
I knew the bottom left dude gonna cry about something 😭😂😂
The 2022 WORLD CUP FINAL IS THE GREATEST GAME EVER
Mark Ogden is as irrelevant as they come
I THINK HALLAND IS BETTER THAN MBAPPE BUT HE SHOULDNT HAVE CHOSEN TO PLAY FOR NORWAY!! BECAUSE HE WILL NEVER BE IN A WORLDCUP FINAL! BECAUSE HE IS IN A SHITTY NATIONAL TEAM HENCE HE WLL NEVER BE IN THE GREATS ARGUMENT!
There's a difference though. CR7 put Portugal on the map with lesser talent. Messi didn't do that. Argentina will always be a force in football. Portugal, probably not. In fact, him winning or not winning the WC was never about Messi vs CR7. It was about Maradona vs Messi. It always was. CR7 greatness in Portugal was never in doubt. For Messi, it was with Argentina.
Comparison is the thief of joy. Just enjoy the win ffs. Why this childish GOAT debate.
Please stop compare Ronaldo to messi its disrespectful to messi
No Messi is not the best best player ever... he's choked more than win on the international level.   He's the best of this generation (modern football) but not best ever.
Matadors was also on some sweet nectar lol hAhahaha
ESPN say so then it must be true ha,ha.
Mbappé future GOAT?
How biased these pundits are. The say he can't be greatest because he alhasnt won an international trophy. Then they say he hasn't won a world cup. Now they still deny his status as greatest. Just bias
There was never a GOAT debate, it was over long ago around 2014.. MESSI MESMERIZING BUTTERFLY PLAYS, DRIBBLING EFFORTLESSLY LIKE WATER FLOW DOWNSTREAM..  #1..MESSI MAGIC OF GOG'S GIFT #2..MARADONA #3..Brazil Ronaldo #4.. #5.. #6.. #7.. #8.. #9.. #10.. Ronaldo MadREFF buying EU REFFs. SPAIN is MadREFF, SPAIN is NadREFF.
8th ballon do'r coming soon for 👑 messi
Yes he finally ended 🐐 debate but kylian Mbapppe is coming for that status
That cumt mark odgen always choose Penaldo ahead of Messi.. Now the dude argues Messi is best of his generation.. Maradona was kicked more..    Yes cumt.. Now you will count the number of times a player kicked.. Grow up salty Mark.
As a long time Ronaldo fan, I have to say Messi definitely is closer to GOAT status then Ronaldo. He played much better in this World Cup then Ronaldo did. If all things equal between the two, this World Cup performance tipped the scales given that both Argentina and Portugal had equally fantastic teams. Messi was the difference maker for Argentina whereas Ronaldo had a rather disappointing outing this time around.
Ale Moreno nailed it. Why even debate when Portugal was not even in the final?  Kay loves to do that without context. Ale Moreno slapped that argument for once.
Meanwhile Ronaldo getting ready for new Piers Morgan interview, How Portugal coach disrespected Ronaldo keeping him on the bench.
Ronaldo is the Grumpiest of all time
3:30 Best part of this video 🐐🙌
For me it depends where you from. If you are from European. He already the best of all time. But for any North American or South American. For us the World Cup is everything. Bigger than the champion league and everything else.
Well said Mark🤝
Was zidane better than Ronaldo? Ronaldinho? Best of which generation
Mbappe was nowhere to be found in the first half. Maybe 11 touches at most. Mbappe is good but he still has some time to grow
They were so ready to make this video😂. If it was the other way around no one would have said a thing.
Maradona didn’t need 5 penalties in 7 games , mbappe is already better and messi is lucky to have even won
Messi is not half as good as Maradona
debate is over messi is the best in the world
Debatte ended today. Messi is the Goat of his time. Maybe Ronaldo shot some 4:0, 5:0 goals more and has few goals in total, but that doesnt matter. Messi is simple the Best of his time and look at the fans what they are doing for him and how they feel for him
Cr fans boys r officially dead he he ..messi 8th ballind too ..double strike again he he cry baby
The save by Martinez (with his legs) few seconds before the final whistle was just incredible.
Don’t forget about Pele…3 to 1…let’s do math people
Excellent 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Sincere thanks to Scaloni to bring this joy to all of us. He brought Messi to this level today. God bless Messi, Scaloni and Golie.
Messi was always expected to perform at a higher standard than ronaldo. It was never demanded of ronaldo that he win a World Cup. Never. He stank out every World Cup he ever played in. He never scored a goal in the knockout stages of the World Cup and he’s not even Portugal’s top scorer at the World Cup
He's second to Maradona all time.
Born in 2001,never saw Maradona Play, leave alone Pele but it was 2010 that I first heard about Lionel Messi and just admired how he played , watched him play at his best and conquer Europe. His national team was his biggest cristism but he never gave up with his ups and downs. Without doubt I can say Messi is the GOAT 🐐
France made 7 substitution’s smh!!
End of the debate 😀😀😀
Messi is the best…..press ever. Easy to be Messi.
With VAR, Maradona doesn't get a worldcup. Period.
That first penalty HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
If you have the best player, ever, in your team, surely you do not need a gift penalty every game, to win Fifa world championshp. I think Messi is the GOAT, but refereeing was all for Argentina
That was no penalty. The French barely touched him. The refs and FIFA wanted a messi win. One penalty can change entire trajectory of game yet same done to France and no penalty. Rigged by refs  this was rigged not a win. Asterisk. The referee and FIFA chose for argentine to win. It was a joke
Unreal game. Messi is 35 and still contributed at that level throughout the tournament. He has to be the GOAT.
He is not. Pele and Diego still above him.
Congratulations Argentina!! This match was one filled with rollercoasters of emotions. Best final ever. Well played.
It should have never been a debate to begin with .
Maradona is smiling rn
Thanks God Almighty 🙏 For giving this honour to lionell Messi .
GOAT ARGUMENT DONE!!!!
Of course they gave Messi the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter  Not before France concealed it for about 80 minutes
For media, there was always one goat. Why do they even pretend to be neutral?  Get me on the show and I will prove them why Ronaldo is the actual Goat not this midget. Messi scored a long range tapin and a 45m penalty today as well. I guess thats goat worthy?
We 2000s kids Never saw Maradona play...For us Messi is the best in our generation
im so sorry i feel so bad to cr7 fans but thank u for all of the drama since cr7 landed in madrid, 😂 siiiiiiiiii!
The GOAT is only Messi 🐐❤️
I don't care who is the goat..man i love football because of messi.
Fake penalty TERRIBLE REF  GIVE RONALDO 6 PENALTY
Zidane is over rated.
Messi, Messi, MESSSSSSSSSSSi!!!!!!!.. GOAL GOAL GOAL GOAL GOAL GOAL GOAL GOAL… OAL!!! 🐐🇦🇷🏆🫡🤯 … I prayed the night before the game starts🤦🏾‍♂️ 😂.. He continues to make history!!
The players that English geezer mentioned have all mentioned Messi is the best themselves 😂
The best player ever? Pele.
Not a fan of France but God danm what a game that was the French  team are fighters that’s something they should be proud off but messi is a genius
Messi is better than ALL of them. The game has evolved where athletes are better, faster, stronger. He is the Greatest of ALL TIME
Messi is not human
the debate is over
Lionel Messi is the official 🐐. What a game 🔥
This is the greatest night in the entire history of sports 🎉
The debate was settled long before
I am very happy for Argentina and Messi but still Ronaldo is the goat for me
Is it just me or is it difficult to take serious a player who scored 3 goals in 40 caps for Venezuela and never played a World Cup and in Europe?
Messi GOAT 🐐
Mark and his United agendas...Messi is the best Ever...After today
Pele is the Goat
No debate Messi all the way
Messi is a penalty merchant
I agree 100% with Mark Ogden. Every generation has its outstanding player and for the last 15 years Messi was the best. But you can’t compare him with other generations, because Football has change a lot. In Pelés time yellow cards didn’t exist, so he got kicked a lot. Just enjoy the fact that we had the chance to see Messi in our lifetime.
World Cup should never decide who is the greatest individual player !!! for example its not Haaland fault that he was born in Norway!!! His golden years won't be visible on World Cup stage if Noway fails to qualify ~ so I believe to win the world cup you also need a very good team & support of others, like Messi got of gk Martinez !! For small footballing nations, World Cup shouldn't be the only parameter.
Messi scored 4 penalties out of the 7 goals he scored.. If CR7 won the Cup scoring 5 penalties, this ESPN crew would have ripped him apart , dissected every goal and concluded that it still wasn't good enough!!
MESSI: THE GOAT ❤
You will not get your salary if you don't speak about CR 7
Ale with an excellent point, Cristiano really isn't anywhere close to Messi (or Maradona, Pele type GOAT tier players) - his biggest achievement in his career was even being compared to Messi at all.
Messi is better than all players who have ever played football. Statistics dnt lie. Assists,, goals, chances created and the way he beautiful the game is incredible
I bow to the GOAT Lionel Messi, I don't have much to say about Maradona but Ale did speaks my heart out loud and clear.
mbappe hatrick is also not enough to stop 'ANKARA  MESSI'.
Respect👋🙌🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥
What separates Messi and Ronaldo is personality. It's easier to love Messi. He's less ego. Less self obsessed. More focused on how he can adapt his game to benefit the team.   But may I add, they probably needed one another. To push each other to greater heights
Messi is the best ever!!!!!
Messi the GOAT!..
Today you got to see why it was always so difficult to win it when Aguero turns away from the penalty kicks and just couldn't look. For a moment you understood that they couldn't hold their nerves when Messi failed they crumbled, that despite their great careers they were too nervous for the job.
I dont wanna hear any cr7 fans messi won the hardest tournament but ronaldo is one of the best ever cr7 didnt have the support from Portugal as messi had with Argentina they believe in messi so much , both of them suffered so much and are a aspiration to me man they came from working class families , and made it im truly happy for both
Ahhaahaha best player ever ??? You are delusional if you Think messi is better than Maradona or pele. Kids nowadays
End of the game,I believe argentina played like a team...France scored two penalties and they lost....think about that
The best ever
Pele....3 for 3 in WC finals. Messi is 1 for 3
the goat debate she said lol  their is no debate, penaldo did nothing, got benched, left the world cup crying, is jobless and about to sign for al nassr lol
Love Messi, but he let France back in the match being lazy on the ball. Martinez came up big.
Where's Shaka?? I'm missing his tears.
where is shaka?
It is not about One tournament. Plus this could have gone wrong after Messi's lost ball to Coman led to Mbappe's tying the game..and then Rabiot could have finished it the game...and then what?
Hgh ends the debate
5:41 did he said "the original Ronaldo"?😭🤣🤣🤣
Congrats Messi 🐐& Argentina! what a way to end the World Cup
Christiano Benchaldo must be crying sitting on the bench 🤣🤣🤣
why compare.....both legends a team has won get out easpn
Ale is right. This is an unnecessary conversation.   🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷
There is no debate now
Not a big fan of iechgaray
Looks like ESPN won worldcup instead  of Argentina.
As a Ronaldo fan I am happy for messi
I used to not like Ale Moreno. But as i watched all his opinions and analysis in ESPN, i have come to the conclusion that he’s a fair man. And i respect him alot now. I also dont really like Messi-Ronaldo debate that has been going on for many years now. Both of them respect each other. Just enjoy them.  Only the fans disrespectful banter isnt much to anyone’s liking. But hey, it’s Messi and Argentina’s moment. VAMOS!!! 🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮
only one who spoke sense was mark
Lionel Messi  Deigo Maradona  Cristiano Ronaldo  Pele  Cryuff
Ale and espn such a hater act like Ronaldo never do anything as a football 😅he him self was a footballer which never reach no where😂
Messi was always the greatest of his generation and better than CR7. With this win and his performance, he’s Legit GOAT and surpasses Maradona
Vamos 🇦🇷🇦🇷
Never saw Pele Play. But I have see most of the Greats of this era. Its Messi for me. He did things with a ball nobody has ever done. He was complete. A goal scorer, a play maker with a superior football IQ. What makes this a non debate as well look at what he continues to do at 35.
Colonial France LOST. Happy for Messi and well done Mbappe. France deserved the loss for all the evil & terror they do on the African continent. The French gov't sponsors dictatorship.
Even the ESPN analyst wants to know why Ronaldo involved in this debate. Y'all are so ridiculous :/
The Mozart of our game for eternity.All the cynics,crtitics & haters keep throwing ur bricks at him! He take them and build another monument to the genius with them.Messi's world where the insane & impossible becomes the expected 🇦🇷🐐
OLD MAN MESSI CAN ENJOY HIS NEWFOUND TERRITORY AS LONG AS IT LASTS..MBAAPE GOT A HAT-TRICK WHILE HAVING ALREADY WON IT..MESSI N RONALDO R FINISHED WHILE MBAAPE WILL STILL PLAY IN WORLD CUP AND ONLY MAN TO CHALLENGE PELE'S THREE WORLD CUPS..💪💪
Uno affi mention cr7
Ronaldo  is out of the goat debate.
Please don't forget the fact that, Africans boys almost got France another world cup😤
Maradona cheated to win his World Cup.. Call it whatever you want, give it a cool name, in the end, he cheated 🤷‍♂️
Ronaldo is going to commit suicide
France imports so many good players from Africa and has so many options on the bench unlike Argentina or even Brazil, some of the south american players even represent elite European countries.... France definitely has a future to win 1 or 2 world cups in upcoming world cups..
This Mark is a certified Penaldo nuthugger lol
Messi not for me the greatest
Mbappe will break all records in his career
Ronaldo fans crying in the comments 😂 😂😂😂😂
MESSI IS THE GOAT OFFICIALLY
End debate! The Goat is Messi.
I hope Neymar is paying attention to what Messi did and come back to another World cup.
It’s a PRIVILEGE to watch the GOAT become UNDISPUTED in his sport!
French fans are awfully quiet 😂🇦🇷❤️🇦🇷❤️
Messi is the greatest ever. Its like telling me Tesla can't be compared to horse-carriages because they were different eras...
MESSI = GOAT. End of the debate.
Give this guy the eight Ballon D’ Or already. 🤌🏻
Pele always the greatest for me.
He’s out of Maradona’s shadow now they stand side by side as Argentine legends🙏
The best match ever OMG what😱
Jus see da stats guys
Wait I love Ronaldo but last time I checked mostly EVERYONE including me had Messi over Ronaldo before this
Mbappe appreciation post :   This guy at 23 single handedly kept France in the game in the full 120 mins with a hattrick of his own. He has already won a WC and he'll probably have a couple more before he retires 👑👑👑
Messi 🐐🐐
Now Shaka hislop can finally shut up “nO cUp He NoT tHe GoAt” lol 🤡
Is there still any doubt???!!!!!...LM10 is 🐐
i wanna see shaka
It's just unfortunate that Ronaldo doesn't have the backing of any team he's playing for right now
Most forced debate in history, it was always between Messi and Maradona.
To win game: Messi To sell shirt: Ronaldo To create business: Flamini To create hype: any English young players
Trust Mark to bring the typical boring english argument 'maradonna got kicked' 'maradonna played on bad pitches' No player in the future will ever play on pitches as bad as previous players did. So are we saying that no one can ever be the best in the future because pitches are better? such a ridiculous argument. Its like saying the Romans were better fighters than Mike Tyson and Mohammed Ali because they had to fight to the death.
Pessi fangirls incoming............
Bayern Munich 8-2 Barcelona
He has not eclipsed Diego Maradona.    Stop being sensationalist with that reporting.    He has equaled Maradona's world cup achievement of winning the cup once and also winning a runners up medal.   The difference is Diego Maradona won his world cup when he individually was carrying the team on his back at age 25, the peak of his prowess.   Messi never accomplished that during his peak fitness and agility at age 23 or 27 or even 31.   He approached this world cup with a lot of preparations with the Argentinian team to synergize a very well balanced squad that utilized him as a playmaker to pivot upon.  Maradona in 86 was on the other hand, a one man machine, a GOATED of all time version of an unplayable footballer that actually surmounted every opposition thrown at him and he individually crushed them with aplomb.  That is why for me Maradona in 86 is the most GOAT version of any footballer at any time.   Messi as a whole, for the long duration of his career is the GOAT for consistency and brilliance for all time.
What does Americans know abt football
Lmao this guys comments they just had to talk about ronaldo
MESSI IS OFFICIALLY THE GOAT 🐐 ❤🇦🇷⚽️
Ronaldo is having a terrible year :(
You cannot compare mbapee with Messi . The French team is way better than Argentina. Messi is carrying the team . Without h, they would have never have qualified to the final
LOL to say zadine or  maradona  is better  Messie is just BONKERS
He is nothing, but a chance & lucky day
Spot on from Ale. No need to bring Ronaldo into this
Aside from being the most gifted player ever seen, Messi is also a true team man, willing to adapt to the role required of him. If somebody else is better placed to get the goals and glory, he'll gladly provide for them. Meanwhile, there's Ronaldo more concerned with scamming group stage goals he never even touches, his hangers on raging that a 37 year-old isn't having everything built around him anymore.
8 Ballon D’Or coming ❤
This Question is for Mr. Hislop
No Clown. the best the last couple of years been Mbappee
Thank you 🙏🏾
If you have nothing good to say about Cr7, please leave him alone. Hard work should be appreciated and Ronaldo is one major icon. He's the Goat regardless.  Congratulations to Argentina and Messi
Used to be Messi miss crucial penalties. Now they say he score too many penalties. 😂
These guys don’t like Ronaldo very much
the whole of Italy celebrates the defeat of the Gauls beyond the Alps..and the defeat of Macron................
Sad but probably true, anyways kudos kylian, what a player!! a new star is born, I know he won 4 years ago but this is the first game where he really showed the world he's the next in line to be one of the best ever,     Bravo kylian, je suis tres fiers de toi et bonne chance pour 2026.  Mais quel coupe du monde!!
Shaka isn't available cause he can't say the truth
Messi is bigger then Maradona but Pele is better but its close
Mate your whole company has been built on Ronaldo being a topic on your show lol
Messi better than maradona . He was more consistent
You guys no nothing about football
Messi wanted the golden boot so bad that he was willing to have his mother assist pks, Maradonna and Messi  and Fifa are FRAUDS
As a Messi fan, Ronaldo is right next to him, both are the best player in the world
If you have ever thought Ronaldo is a better footballer than Messi , you need to start watching another sport !
Thanks fifa 🙏🙏🤪🤪
1. Messi 2. Maradona 3. Pele 4. CR7 5. Zidane or R9. That's the list
He was already the goat before this WC, this win is just the icing on the cake
Messi 🐐
Well these guys are already messi's fan
In the end, it's really just down to personal preference. It wouldn't surprise me if there was still a Messi vs Ronaldo debate even after tonight.
To recap, he needed 6 pks to get to s final against a team missing the reigning balon dor holder, last world cups mvp, and pogba out of their starting lineup. Messi is not the best ever
As a messi fan, both Ronaldo and messi are G. O. A. T
Ronaldo still the GOAT, Messi is just a media agenda against CR7
Messi is the greatest of all generations. That English geezer who can’t do math is JEALOUS 😂
It is not even a debate. True neutral football fans know it is Messi.
It's over
Pessi again carried by...martinez...i mean he literally dont deserve to win .
The comparisons are over. Messi is undisputed
THAT’S WHY HE’S THE GOAT 🐐 THE GOOOOOAAAT 🐐
Messi is the best , end of debate
let enjoy and congratulations to messi the  greatest complete player of all time and the entire team of Argentina for his last moment.
Smiley face beats Cry baby
Cristiano Ronaldo🐐>Fifanel Penalessi
Argentinians will now say Messi and Diego
France had artillery and ammunitions to spare  But argentina had a freaking nuclear missile ❤️
Shaka still won't admit Messi is the one I'm sure of it
Every head must bow.. Every knee must kneel.. Every tongue must confess.. SAY HIS NAME ONCE AND FOR ALL Lionel Andrés Messi is the Greatest Of all Time.
The fact that at the age of almost 36having only 45% capability of his peak,he showed a player of the tournament performance is unheard of!! LEO MESSI The Undisputed GOAT🐐✨
Even if argentina won or lost, I still consider Goatwaithe the best ever. 🐐
Messi has always been the GOAT . This was just like a confirmation not a proof. Also this prevents any irrelevant arguments cuz now he has won it allll!
Thank You Messi for bringing so much joy to the football lovers he was and still is the GOAT
God gave Messi this!
Messi, the absolute GOAT 🐐
Thank you @Ale_Moreno... probably the only one with brains on there... 👏  Oh... And Messi is the Greatest!!
Messi didn't need to win the World cup to prove that he is the Goat actually... People are just BIAS to their Ronaldo and Maradona Nostaliga nothin much... How on earth 700 goals and 7th Ballon dor and after this World cup he is getting 8th Ballon dor for sure, is being compared to Ronaldo and Maradona is beyond me.... Lets look at the stats... the Stats speaks for it self.  Messi Longevity is 10x better Than any player in the History... but if we are talking about Prime players at 1 year or 1 season.. you could pick so many.. Maradona, Zidane, Ronaldinho.. etc... But Messi is the Greatest of all time when it comes to Longevity.. this is a fact..
Someone check on Piers Morgan..
A yo @lmecgegaray what up now? He was saying that Argentina would lose to croatia in semi's. Now look at him, these pundits always change there statement. Vamos Argentina
Great picture of CR7 because he’s definitely crying right now. He probably broke his Tv after he saw Messi win
VAMOS ARGENTINA!!!!
It's doneeee
R9
And Messi "The G.O.A.T" has stamped his place finally no more arguments from his arch rival Ronaldo fans they can fancy the cup in their dreams,, Messi has worked his magic what a blissfull end to a legend
Being a Ronaldo fan, I have to humbly submit to the fact that the GOAT title goes to Messi. It hurts to admit that but truth can be hurtful at times. On an ending note, I will say that Mbappe had a spectacular game today and will hopefully have a bright future.
No its not over lmao
Maradona spirit game thru clutch
Fair play to Ronaldo for praising Messi for winning the World Cup. Obviously he’s gonna congratulate Messi but I bet it’s killing Ronaldo inside when he was typing it. 😂
Nope, he is not the best player ever end of story....
I want to hear Shaka Hislop say it.
ESPN. Speaks about NFL.. This is really what you understand. There is only one GOAT and with Three World Cyps. Only one!!!!!!
1. Messi 2. Maradona 3. Pele 4. Cristiano Ronaldo 5. Ronaldo/Johan Cruyff
Messi was involved in all of their 3 Goals.Great Performance by the Greatest Footballer Ever.Messi Must get his 8th Ballon D’Or  Leo Messi The Undisputed GOAT🐐✨
Lionel Messi. El Mejor! 🐐
The only comparison that remains is Messi or Maradona That too only in terms of pure footballing ability.. Messi has a PERFECT footballing career.
Would of loved to of seen Messi in the premier league or another league for a couple of seasons … oh well
This might be the worst year of Ronaldo's life
Greatest game I’ve watched in any sport. The way Mbappe, Coman and Camavinga brought back France was admirable. But Messi is something else.
Messi is the GOAT
There is absolutely no more doubt! This man is the greatest “human” to ever touch a football. 💙🇦🇷
It's done its over
