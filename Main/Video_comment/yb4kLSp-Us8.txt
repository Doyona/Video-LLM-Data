10:16 wild coyote movie clip coming up
9:12 hey buddy, are you happy that you’re getting arrested today?😂😂😂😂😂
god bless swat guys
Im late here, but I got SOOOO UPSET when you didn’t pass the pull-up test because WE ALL KNOW you can do it.. but the back to back test suck and def make it so much harder.. my point being is that your one tough cookie and i know though can do it.. keep on keeping on girl!
lol she always goes off before the timer 😂
No women as police!!!! It's unsafe for everyone!!!
50:00 she started early
❤️ You inspire me to step out of my comfort zone with every challenge! THANK YOU SISTER
I hate this
just saying how I appreciate they put girls to be with her in the test that is really dope.
"a little birdie told me she has a fear of heights" little does ANY of them know three years later she hangs off the side of an airplane in the air without a parachute....
I would compromise with this
"Yeah...I've already got the handcuffs at home. I just need some of those restraint techniques, in order to put someone in cuffs." -Michelle (probably)
Stell söunde ap leer inbgh8
Too good and you are strong, but there are even serious mistakes.
'Michelle may have a fear of heights.' says the Chief.  11:37 Fast forward to today and her hanging off the side of a C130 while in flight. :)

This was the first video I saw of yours. From the very beginning, I fell in love with your style, your boldness, your courage. I promise to watch them all and tell you the ones I don't like. I'm a Scout, a Combat Nurse, a Colombian Army veteran, a lawyer, and I know what those experiences are like, and you do them wonderfully.
Tv
They escalate, not de-escalate
Are you Brazilian Michelle?

Plz do CIA
Call of duty
Yooooo Call of Duty 15:22
You should do one with rcmp training, that would be cool
Those hard pull ups, baby!💪
4 miles   in  85 sec ?
Timeline: 8:15 Some sources indicated that the Las Vegas shooting story spread by the media is a fake story to hide what truly happened in order to make investigation secret. They said it has to do with attempted take on MBS (Muhammad bin Salman) life. Which failed. Most of the shootings came from black helicopters that were owned / used for training Saudi pilots. After that instance, that is when we got the Jamal Kashogi assassination in Turkey and the imprisonment of Saudi princesses and other members of the royal family in 2017 at five-star Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Riyadh. Al Waleed bin Talal Al Saud is also among the people that were tortured.
Hello Friends I From Blairsville Georgia GA Mountains

16:00 I might do this with my friends
at this point we’re a couple videos away from “The CIA let me record at Langley!”
The seals do this too but for threats that most likely won't surrender
It’s really embarrassing to breach an unlocked door 🤣
Michelle needs to be in a movie
6:24 at my school when we have lock downs that’s what exactly what we call one of the corners with a red arrow taped on the wall (I want to go into law enforcement like my parents and step dad do and two of my favorite shows is literally cops and s.w.a.t. 2017 remake)
17:03 Omg I'm rolling on the floor 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣I can't stop laughing🤣

You should do assassin training
Thanks to bring this up
When is your birthday 🎉
The way shes infront of him, its so cute!! Shes so tiny!!
I hope this actually puts a lot into perspective for those who don't understand how difficult and intense it is to be a law enforcement officer.
2025 anyone
Wow another girl using her attractiveness to do the things everyone in the world wants to but doesn’t get to because they’re not attractive. Thanks internet.
9:32 the "KNOCK KNOCK" got me good😭

17:01  “WHAHAAAAA”
TY,MY DREAM JOB IS TO BE IN THE SWAT TEAM AND I BEEN WANTING TO SEE A VIDEO OF WHAT THE TRAINING IS LIKE AND HOW IT IS
Nope weak obstacle course …. These swat guys need more training like HRT operators FBI lack of leadership  for these city guys
Bro. Swat. Is. Chill.  But.  Fbi. No
Just a reminder that Jesus loves us so much ❤😊
For anyone who thinks she was overreacting about the flashbang, I went to a police camp where we got a SWAT demo and they threw a flashbang without warning us and I still haven’t recovered from how loud it was💀
Ok
10:17 before he blew up the door a St.Jude hosp ad popped up
I saw you on a ad😂
LEGO FBI????????????????
As a swimmer, I would like you to try swimming 🏊‍♀️
As an 11 year old, that dummy weight is 100 pounds heavier than me. There is no way I could carry that 2:57
At 6:48 she was so excited like it she was a toddler that was so happy for a birthday cake not in a bad way
This video was AMAZING, Michelle!
7:55
Waitttttttt do u live in Chicago
Yo that obstacle course is no joke
Btw my favorite training is rappeling❤❤
Without this soldiers, the world is messy
When you walk right past when someone is in there, it’s just like hide and seek
"We won't get into that"  "But that's cool!"  *sigh* "Fine, clear!"  "All clear!"  "Last room!"  "Let's  go!"  That exchange had me dead 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆 🤣 😂
True SWAT story. Some 20 years ago, the SWAT team of the Budapest Police Directorate (in Hungary) was sent to apprehend a major drug dealer who was armed and dangerous. He lived in a small condo. A reporter accompanied the SWAT team, whom I happen to know. A decision was made to breach immediately, and disarm the guy before he had a chance to react. The team silently approached the door, they all lined up for the breach, and the commander whispered: "Guys, where's the battering ram?" Turns out they forgot to bring one. Meanwhile, the guy noticed them somehow, climbed out of his window, up to the roof, and vamoosed in the night. Nobody was securing the building from the outside, it was the reporter who noticed the guy climbing up on the gutter. This debacle was one of the reasons why the government detached SWAT operations from the national police and created a professional counter-terrorism agency.

I love Michelle so much! She is so kind and has such a loving smile! She is such an inspiration and so brave! I want to be like her when I grow up!
I know all the stuff because of siege
RIP to the police officer or an important police member that died😞 fly high🕊️🕊️
Women take to long,men we have speed and we don’t care about injuries just move.
imagine an actual guy who planning some criminal stuff, watching all your videos and taking notes of military tactics from FBI to swat technique. lol
I would say left side clear  my partner : right side clear  me room clear
Omg the things that michelle does
As someone who has done hundreds of dummy drags...that shit will wear you OUT. Especially since courses that use them usually do them near the end. Love it.
I ❤swat I'm being it for Halloween
I have a one of those weird masks
Nice
Try Diplomatic State Security
I’m going to be in the office tomorrow morning and 😮y
Nope
My absolute favourite thing about the challege accepted videos, is Michelle bringing a breath of fresh air to the men and women that work in serious positions. You can tell that they appreciate the light heartedness and often times I think Michelle even shows them a new perspective on what they do by having no filter and saying what's on her mind which normal recruits wouldn't dare be able to do.
Dale Ways
When she say call of duty is so hard i said in real life you are playing call of duty
im going full cod slide cancelling into a corner  (guys this is joke dont take me srsly)

SALVE QUESTO È UN BEL VIDEO SALUTI DA VLADIMIR.
Personally, I always loved acting as the injured in scenarios. His little “my leg” had me laughing but I woulda been fully committed
They're more cheerful compared to secret service peeps
4:18
i only 10 and fat and i can do 10 pushups 😂😂
"call of duty in real life is real hard"? it's not a joke
16:33 bravo six going dark
I watch every squad movie I'm a big fan of the squad
Not Michele literally joining the swat. Next she’s gonna go to war 💀💀
Since when did Hondo’s team show up 😂
6:08 i think i saw Michelle's partner in the CSI Academy Video behind the police car.
The “Hands Down! Hands Down” had me crying until she realized no I want his hands up lol CQC gets the best of us on edge.
he one man had something over his sign, that means someone has died
I Tried SWAT Academy
Great video! Thank you for the awesome content!
under 5 years gang lol
they must go through an awful lot of doors in training
I love how the tourniquet fell off at 20:40
I want you to try go to china in wudang mountain to learn tai chi
Do paraolympics games ...
The test is easy as fUAAAAck
2:29-
She truly is underrated like wow the dedication she puts into every single video and the level of production is incredible. She deserves WAYYY more recognition!!!
at this point, michelle's resume is looking beyond human comprehension
if the fitness test is like this how tf are there fat cops lmao
How does she manage to make these people agree on making a video. She plays chess with levy and hikaru, gets lessons from swat and secret agencies but how?
Aw me leg
My YouTube was very laggy and there was an overlay on the video that was said Amazon😂
Bro it’s my dream to join the SWAT team, I fully appreciated this video
The SWAT Team is like the Military.
Martinez Mark Walker Jeffrey Robinson Daniel

Woah you have tried almost everything Amazing Job Michelle😊😊

Smith Ronald Anderson Patricia Moore Jose
Become detective
Michelle, YOU are funny!
Well done!
my favorite part was the "no" at 17:14
As just a young teenager, this inspired me to try out SWAT Academy when I'm older.
12:25 she looks so terrified
4:21 The guy in this clip of this video looks very much like John Cena. That's why I thought it was John Cena.
That no at 17:12 😂😂😂😂😂
Comando haria haria ✨
Comando haria haria ✨
Low standards for physical
Do you realize how the chief has a black band over his badge? That means that an officer has died in the last week. o7

14:19 it’s always former employees and bosses for the hypothetical situations 😂
Fair play! Would love to do this
bro you all are lazy, i can finish the tryout in 1 Milla second
The SDPD Chief had a black band around his badge, which means that they lost an officer before the time of the recording, my condolences to the officers family and friends.
mm2 wall camping be like 19:18
Next you should do gymnastics or swimming two of the things I find hard to
I do have more respect for the swat teams now, this is low key inspiring just to be fit and stronger. Also gives a good idea of what teamwork should really be like.
20:43 take it back now yall
Try the k9 handler training
Sorry for Your loss 00:21
hi
You are amazing....
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
What is the movie?
skydiving
😂
Hey Michelle I’ve watched all of your academy videos can you pin me or reply❤❤
I have a massive girl crush on you
Up Next: "I Try the CIA"
was this the hardest challenge excepted?
i likex the secrect forces one better
Try a soccer player next
Michelle khare ❤so hot and beautiful you are and as an agent in any agency or department! You are hot looking ❤!
did you use real guns at the end?

Mam is very pretty ❤
That was SICK🫡🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🦅🇺🇸
The high quality editing and shots always make me come back
As a gymnast I was wounding if you could try being a gymnast for a day?? I literally watch your videos like every single day! They are awesome 🤩! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💕💕 thank you!

5:25 are we gonna ignore how this man looks like ryan reyonalds

6:58 well I gotta say that its not a John Wick Movie... all the tactical guys are Probably gonna rage so hard on that Id say
Outstanding video.

J'ai tellement SWAT enfin ❤❤❤
“Rah rauh rah raah” -K9
I love swat team i wanna be one i know its not easy
At around 15:50 it put up a photo of Michelle and it came up with the introducing the swat member at the same time I ddint know she was already in the swat😂😂😂😂😂
😒 This is a joke.
***Don't get too manly on us now Michelle!***
You should try united States marshal service
My takeaway: As a SWAT officer, I'm conflicted here. She failed the initial physical assessment but performed well in light of the limited amount of training for this experience. She has the ability to do the job, and so it seems she is trainable.
Every like is one appreciation to the cameraman 👏
Nahh where did she do this at?? I want to do this so bad
Those flash bangs are loud AF. I visited Quantico once and they set off a couple for us in a ditch next to the training building. You can feel them in your chest.
17:06 „WaUAaAAHHHhH
Im like steven segull but the thought of being part of a swat te scares the shit outta me like monsters inc.
I remember the mini obstacle course from highschool it took teamwork to get thru it lol
My favourite vid of this channel
me: *try to be one* my asthma: you even try I'll shut down your lungs!!
aaaa my leg
she had ptsd lol
hey i have a video idea do sniper class!!!
14:53 "hands down" is probably the best command youd get from a SWAT michelle..
17:04 Michelle Scream Likes she saw a murder
"welcome to mcdonalds may i take your order" "yes may i have the mcmassacre" "THE MCWHAT"
solution: dont have guns
Hi
15:35  he definitely knows that’s the line at the end of every mission in the game swat 4 lol
I swear even a full grown body builder probably wont want to fzce her after all this training and stuff she's done also if they use rockets and shit or weapons of mass destruction nah and if ur a criminal doing that that would notify the FBI
I wonder if the end, the "Actual S.W.A.T. Shooter" Was real...
20:40
i want a part 2
HEY  give the editor a raise  THIS. LOOKING LIKE A TV SHOW
11:46 R6 stuff
8:06 you need to use your drone to locate the bomb
Call of duty in real life is hard 🤣🤣🤣🤣

16:05 LOL
My dad works what is a police in one of his friends name is some of Michelle
awesome training
As a 9 year old I am surprised that I can do more sit-ups than Michelle. (60)
She really said call of duty is hard in real life 16:05
5:49 big misconception to run in, etc. But for your entrance exam we are going to have you do a whole bunch of things which is really a big misconception of what we actually do.
that is nothing compared to CIA i am former CIA
🤣😂🤣😂 i fail at the sprint mention.

What is that combat shirt. Let me know that information
This is such a intense career job I would never do respect to all the people that risk their own life ❤
“Knock knock” 😃😀
I would think at this point Michelle would look like a muscular bodybuilder. Like if you agree Michelle is an absolute warrior
Aaaaaaaaaaaa     aaaaaahhhh
Michelle Khare and Garrett Khare and all the team members are my favorite friends in the world I love your guys videos and I love you guys❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This was two years ago...insane.
It's crazy how this woman puts her life in ALL of these different jobs just for Fame. I respect that ;)
What do you have a gun on you when you’re on the road trying to get to the second window
if mulan was a real person... she would be it.
although she didnt make it through the initial qual course... great job on perseverance and completing the course... i was screaming at my screen like lets go lets goooooo!
first time i went through a cqc scenario with my unit i didnt know wtf was going on... so much chaos...
Wow
I'm already feeling tired of seeing you doing all the training😂
Imagine her doing training at GIGN😂
A solo trainee
Dear miss Khare.  i understand it's quite a bit late but still better late then never.  I would like to ask what your opinion is about the video of a youtuber called  Will Tennyson.  This person Literally COPIED your title and didn't even do HALF the work you put into this concept...  i consider this will Tennyson in violation by stealing your valor there....    you put some serious blood sweat and tears in this concept and the videos you make and this is what this man does with literally your title..........    its at least worth to ask some questions here.     no matter if you decide to reply or even read it after at least a year i respect that but i just wanted to say it anyway.
21:22 they sound like some arg voice recording lol
It always sucks how we have to learn from mistakes which costs lives but at least we can now do something to try and prevent it.
Fum fact: Los Angeles Police Department was actually the first police department to create swat because of killing and shootings they needed a force that can handle dangerous types of situations
Wondering why SWAT needs so many trainings and gears to breach the door when many are questioning why the Uvalde police didn’t not enter the classroom. I guess those who feel Uvalde police had sufficient trainings should just to and be SWAT themselves😂
It's amazing that what they called "The McDonalds massacre" back in the day could be a regular Tuesday nowadays...
I can see why the door breaching is so important   a gunfight can be as short as 1 second and that 1 second can be life or death to your teammates  Hence thats why the instructors firmly say that  securing your team by checking those corners is utmost important to their and your survival
The tough jobs take more than just physical strength but the mental will power and Michelle shows that in these crash courses into the roles.
Michelle can literally act in a M0VIE
The look on her face after she detonated the door breach is a perfect visual representation of what would be going through everyones head after they do the same thing lol
I was almost really paranoid (you know why) but then I realized THESE ARE THE PEOPLE PROTECTING US!
Raise your hand if you ever went to military school🤚🏻
That McDonald’s sh**ting was particularly tragic and infuriating. The cops accidentally went to the wrong McDonald’s for whatever reason. This man tried to get mental health help for multiple days before the incident and wasn’t taken seriously. And, worst of all, he specifically targeted so many mothers and their BABIES.  I’m at least glad they were able to learn from that tragedy though.
10:07 LOBOTOMY REFERENCE
I have been doing stuff like the obstical corce all my life
wawwwwwwwwwww so amazing train i want this train
No the camera man was pro on staryods
In our country it is NSG national security guard
Is that back Betty from Swat on Netflix?😮
"Wait i forgot to record"💀💀💀
Bro idk if the last senarip was fake or real but I LOVED IT!
@Michellekhare your face when YOU detonated the door open xD awesome. I would have done the same. 😅 Thanks for the peak into SWAT training. BOOM. 😮
LOL at the 84s for 400m. As a kid of 13 I ran that in like 60 seconds, with shorter legs :D Those requirements are ass.
Ditz...
Yeaaa
There's a Mission in COD advance warfare or ghost I assume, where the team enters a house, they might not portray a SWAT team but I think that is one of the closest representation how actual jobs work and not always entering banging doors pointing gun at civilians for no reason and shit
FOR CHALLENGE ACCEPTED: I really would love to see you try out Fighter Jet Training!!! I love jets and their sound etc. I can only dream, I am from Namibia, Windhoek and just love watching them. I really would love to see you do it. ✈😍😍

You were a minute away from passing 👏 impressive!!
Really wish to join you in one of this your videos
Thank you for the interesting video. I have only one remark to be fix in this viedeo at 1:08 min. You wrote in the video Maximum 55s and Mininum 85 s. Of course, these numbers should be switched as MININUM 55s and MAXIMUM 85 sec. The same switch at 3:55 min in this video.
Really hard time training 😮😮
About that I really Wana join the swat but I 10 so I can't join?
McMurder ah yes
Would have been perfect if it weren't for that damned tourniquet slipping down to his ankle.
I want to join the Air Force/swat team bc of call of duty (yes I know how it’s rlly like irl not just in games)
With all these videos, it proves you are living the dream. Congrats.
Do you have a boyfriend 😅
how many jobs have you worked at".  Michelle "well I did marine bootcamp,ssa,fbi,csi,swat,911 dispatch and 50 more but there not in the safety area.." "woah this is for mcDonalds...your hired"
Me when I break down the door-   You've got mail
3:32 😂
Do they allow torecord inside a swat eam base or is this teal cuz idontfell lile they will allow that
Please do these challenges: Hospice worker and Funeral helper
this video was amazing
wooooooooooooooooooow
woooooooooooooow
Personally, I do not believe women should be allowed in combat roles, unless they can meet the standard of their male counterparts.  I understand that women a generally weaker in most regards, which is why their standards are lower. But when entering a field such as Law Enforcement, Military, Firefighter, Etc, The situation does not become less dangerous because a woman is on the team. If these men have to be able to fight of an enraged 200lb man, women should have to be able to do the same. Ive seen too many cases of female cops being brutalized because they are overpowered by an average crackhead. In firefighting for example, who would you trust more to carry you out of a building? A built man, or a built woman? Its true that in some cases, women are very strong and can even out-perform most guys, which is fine. I say let those women do what they want. But the majority of female soldiers, cops, and firefighters will die when it comes down to anything strength related when faced against a man.   To end it, I believe women who can meet male standards should be allowed to do these types of work, but if the standards need to be lowered because YOU can't meet them. Then maybe thats a sign you aren't cut out for that particular field.
Js most of the cops in my area couldnt finish that obstacle course
That looked like a lot of fun
This is so cool. I want to do this once, it is really tough because in real life scenarios a small mistake could mean life or death.
what type of ammo were they using
What does it mean by maximum under the training times?
It's like dance, but i want a different partner" - Legend
it was honestly so inspiring to see the two officers supporting michelle through the obstacle course. so much respect for them all.
yesssss girl...in that window!!!
Do navy
As soemone with the BIGGEST fear of ocean and sharks and such, im always nervous for plane rides. And im goung over sea sokn
fun fact:Swat stands for   SPECIAL.WEAPONS.AND.TACTICS
Hahaha
FIRE IN THE HOLEEEEEE 10:07

The most impressive thing was those guys installing a new door in what was probably just under a minute.
Vine boom 17:20
17:20 vine boom
I realized at 2:08 I have been to that course! I was a police explorer for a while and did an academy there. Right after I did that course I got CS gassed twice 😂
Pov: me thinking i could do this easily but then remembering that im just a 11 year old kid with asthma and im underweight who can barely do 2-3 pull-ups. Lol
Cool
what do you do for a living?  her:everything
It is almost like Army Training.
I subscribe u now!
Go girl
she is so lovely :)
the one guy talking about trusting the other guys looks like a youtuber or sum 7:25
Me: *jumps down and runs if I joined the SWAT team*
This is like rainbow six Stege
This woman will soon be the most capable human alive.
welp  i might as well suicide my self if i saw female swat officers coming to rescue me
Kind of inspired me to become a swat member
I wish I could try this!
16:09 - 17:46  BRAVO 6 GOING DARK
Thank you ❤
Isnt swat supposed to be like the special forces of the police department
Ok maximum 55s what happens if you are faster?
If I was in the swat team I’d be the sniper
David Dislike and R. Rude are kind of unfortunate names.
I was actually really surprised to see you fail some of the entry challenges. I don't normally see you fail in this show. I'm glad you still included it.
I love seeing all of your reactions to the cool parts and even the not-so-cool parts.
Hello brown
Those are marks on wall
I’m Phoenix no but Glendale yea
Why
Me 5’1 five foot one thank you
Your to tall
Have you had carpet
The grocery store
It’s live they are on other side of moon
I love that shirt on me 😅
Hold up I know you ❤
this lady NEEDS  a netflix show
Seeing swat and police everywhere is so cool
Is that why they had to lower the barrier to pass it to the exam?
at 6 minutes In I love how you add a die-hard scene and my dad is a swat member
The challenge accepted series is turning her into barbie with all these different professions.
damn harder than my martial arts school. but still a lot of stuff similar to my martial arts school. and I only 9（ofc I am using my mom's acc）.
Imagine having this many connections
Honestly I think you should do one as a veteran
Ahh you are lucky in india we doesn't have training for civilians 😢
I Think It Would Be Nice To Make A Vlog With Her. Im Disabled & Make Vlogs To Be A Positive Motivation!  Positive Vibes From San Diego California ❤
She would make a really good police officer tbh I was prior LE she would be a good officer
just subscribed i love ur videos
You  already did Michelle
As she points a weapon at her instructors head not once but twice. You can see the 1st time how concerned his face was n
So how’s much people died in this process
Michellwutdusitfeatobelicktobearmegirlcarterseb
The little bird : I'm a snitch
fbi open up
SWAT SWAT
The first trainers were just hilarious when Michelle said it was like a dance and he replied he wants another dance partner😂 that got me on the floor laughing 😆 I'm sure they're All Great Dancers too 😎
You Gotta do the taser too
Bro it’s going to be hard
GYAT
Funny, Smart, Strong, Courageous and bold❤
Cool video
Please try Tomb sentinels i love your challenge accepted series
if i were in the swat team i would be doing it like cod and siege
I think you should make a video and do a laughing gas challenge, (which is to video your self under laughing gas.)
hi
At least they are more encouraging here
I know you hear this all the time, But I have to tell you it again……..  you are beautiful  You are smart  You are cool  You are interesting  You are inspiring  You are that girl all will have as a friend  You are perfect  You are strong  You are you 🤩
become a judge
I love how positive and motivating everyone is great environment just having someone there saying you can do it
Im just saying her goal is to prove females can do the same things boys can (From my memory) and let me tell you this proves that with ease and then it also proved their badass.
Swat was my dream career
Mike shake and Michelle needs a colab
SWAT stands for Special Weapons And Tactic
Is that joe Rohan on the cover?
As a SWAT commander I can say that getting correct cover is very important during the missions, I remember the first time I had to breach a door I forgot to take enough distance from the door and I end up dead, but luckily I had saved my game, I toke good cover the next time...   _Don't forget to save your game!_
S. W. A. T is cool it's basically like playing call of duty but it's harder. you are a strong and brave person Michelle
Do counter assault team
Michelle can do anything she is amazing
My beautiful illustration of a room got me dyinggg 5:01
Awesome video
I'm in love
U have the best job
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
interesting that they are relax and chill,german ksk soldierss just do nothing dam,n
I think next time you should try coast guard training and next air force training and next space force training
This women is either CIA or MOSSAD
when you said 20 pushups in a minute, im like thats easy because our gym teachers make us do 30 in 45 seconds. im only in middle school
' HANDS DOWN ' GOT ME ROLLING IN MY GRAVE 💀
🤿🥹
When I did swat school we had to do a minimum of two pull ups but with a thirty pound vest.
i changlle you to try polit acdemy
You need to be on Netflix
This is all fake
4:18 Shelter Island
8:35 Is that the doom slayer's inventory
I’m very scared of to get hurt while doing this you can just do the mall what if you like get hurt or SMTS?
Be an elite spesial forses
I know a lot about s.w.a.t.
HOLY MOLY. I Have so much fking respect for Michelle. Damn. What an inspiration.
I love you and your videos ❤❤❤❤❤❤
DuMb WaYs To DiE💀
This looks amazing Great team work I would definitely be apart of S.W.A.T… tuning in from 🇯🇲🇯🇲🇯🇲
Has she tried being a firefighter or a normal police officer
Your videos are awsome can you make more about flight attend academy its my dream job
"HANDS DOWN"💀💀💀 14:54
Can you try California Highway Patrol Academy
you should try swatting a youtuber
But if thiefs wath this
love it!
MY LEGG
Crying over a flash bang 💀
When I grow up I what too be a swat😂
Her fav thing to do is the explode
Michelle do a video training becoming a fighter jet pilot!!
As a former Swat in my dreams I approve this message!
People who are watching this in 2023
Luv ur vids so awesome
What type of bullets dis they use for the challenge and stuff with the guns
20:30  And so you see, sometimes it's better to wound someone than to kill. Because if you wound them it takes another 2 soldiers away from the field to save that 1
what does "last room" mean, when saying "clear, all clear, last room"?
I’m still watching but I couldn’t wait; they should be able to afford an actual dummy. I mean who made that?!😂😂😂just threw me off haha
Do a TSI one next
I dont really watch her videos but by seeing her challenge accepted titles, shes a very versatile girl
I ma weird
It's kind of ironic that the hardest part is the pull ups. I've done ten times the pushups and situps that in the span of about half an hour, but i could only do like 3 pulls ups despite that mind you this was when i was actually working out. Now, nah, but seriously why are pull ups so hard
Call of duty in real life💀
@Michelle : I do watch your vids , I wonder what the weird challenges you did accepted ?, btw " what a fight " yea what a fight (talking about boxing match) . sending love and respect to you from India (Bharat) . good luck for next challenge
I challenge you to become a cop and patrol with real cops
Anyone else watching this and thinking " 'BANG BANG BANG' FBI OPEN UP"
21:15 its better when you have a BFG 50. i know it takes only one shot but.. one shot = one headshot
after watching this, i may want to go into the swat team cause it looks so cool.
What a experience. Looked so much fun but can't imagine the training exercises 😬 Great job michelle💪💪😉
stop trying to act like a guy
The sniper is my favourite gun
This was absolutely INSANE!! Good on you Michelle! I would never be able to do the physical stuff you put yourself through.
I know that you wear a black strip on your badge when a member of the police department deceases, who died? (I saw one of the members wearing a black stripe on his badge at 4:18 )
This woman is literally barbie
isn't maximum 85s and minimum 55s in 1:07
Lol true
I’m sorry about that officer who died on duty
Hey Michelle! So I wanted to tell you that, it would be awesome for you to be in a movie like, in a show and you would be one of the swat members! Your voice is so incredible, just like in the movies it's just perfect. Alright, have a nice day / night!
I love how she always says things like "I can do better. " she's literally done insane things and she still works on improvement. That's why Michelle is so inspirational🤗
Ok hi i and i je pense à vous pour votre travail de travail pour les vacances et le boulot est bien arrivé et que je ne vais plus me reposer et que vous allez mieux je suis en vacances je vous aime fort fort à toi et je te dis bonne journée
And everything for real 😳 random words from my keyboard
L
I love how even in the final challenge she was learning new things. like with the sniper
“We’re with the San Diego SWAT team” Wait that’s my city. “#### Ruffin road” WAIT THAT’S ONE OF THE ONLY PLACES I’M FAMILIAR WITH (although did not know the area, didn’t know Ruffin road was so big)
My grandma was in the Las Vegas shooting and one of her best friends died 😢
You lady gained another subs. This is the kind of content creator we need. ❤
She wasn’t laughing when she was 40 feet high 😂
I'm addicted to this show! Look at all you are capable of,  Girl!   You meet every challenge willing, open minded, and ready, armed with intelligence and a spirit of adventure.   Props, Young Lady.  I want to share some episodes with my 9 y/o daughter as inspiration.   Great work!
No Brasil isso é o basico. BOPE
you should do FBI HRT academy,that sounds nice.
Straight up this woman is tougher then every woman I know.
Swat has gone woke.
GTA 6 be like
She’s such a kid at heart.
can you try being a baby sitter
why does she put here user name Michelle khare it should be The Challenge Accepter [TCA] just do TCA
Swat: breaches your door. Also swat: Good morning
iff u havent done us navy do that sometime could be cool
9:47
The team work is phenomenal, I can’t even trust a coworker with a lended pen
হেলো আমি রাসেল

Hanging out with man boys …bet on the low you learned more than what is on camera 😜 💚🦂👊🏻💨💨💨pigs are the worst  🐷
hey can you make a movie out of your vid i really love the vids😀😀🙂
Any current or former swat members here that could possibly give some advice to a current serving infantryman in the army about joining the swat program
Shes just so adorable, the way she is excited about everything
In the U.S.A. We have our priorities wrong. Pro athletes, movie actors Etc. Are the highest paid. We pay first responders a minuscule pay. This practice is wrong!!
1:55 past failing the minimum time. -“That was impressive”
did the 911 responder watch
4 Million!
can u please try hockey next
Never give up always be successful michelle i love u❤❤
Im binge-watching your videos lol!
Whenever you are in a situation like this or on the field  like this by catching bad guys on the street you wanna check your corners like left right front and back because someone could run and shoot at you and you want to watch your six and watch your partners back because you won’t know that he’s gonna need help and you never leave your partner alone and behind because he could end up dead and so keep in mind as well that you watch your six and check your corners and check front and behind you including during a breach
Michelle reminds me of Barbie! She can do any thing she puts her mind to. 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
Michelle I really like your videos but I think you would be more popular If you had a gaming channel
I swear when I saw her carrying the 100lbs bag thing when she was done I know she was nauseous but she was so great 😊
The vertical grip can go.
Doesn't Wylie Coyote blow himself up ?
this is dope!!
That thumbnail makes you look like the female version of Tyler1 lol
I see the Journal!!! I just got mine and I'm loving it ! 😊
How ironic is it that they’re doing those repelling tests on like the one day a year it rains in San Diego.
Swat  team has been working on a new gun
“Stay Fluid” “ 2 2” -Shamar Moore
Please invite Shemar Moore
Did the cop got shot with real Bullet or Beebees I have Glock assault rifle Machine gun that’s Gel

HEY! HANDS DOWNnnn.. HANDS UP!!
I like the way she didn't get the wall buy tried again that proves that she is not a quitter and she knows that even if u can't do things u push self to do it
14:54 "HEY HANDS DOWN" lololol
Most realitic acting i have seen in my life 19:36  "i got shot in the leg right here "
next challenge Equestrian?
It is kid’s dream to climb over a fence
Michelle: HOW DO U LAND? like spider man :0? Swat guy: *laugh* Noooo *luagh* Michelle: *dissapointment*
i hope you are ok❤❤
Wow amazing
ничего не понял но очень интересно
This show was great. I've never seen this before.
I bet you can't be nurse!
I love Michelle’s personality ❤❤❤
My step dad used to be on a swat team, he said it was really fun, but chaotic😊😂😅
how the hell does she get all these roles
“Any questions…. no 🥺😢
hi
Michelle is the real life barbie she has tried almost every job!
Hi
You should try French Foreign Legion!
For me this was pubg mobile in real life lol😂
U should act like knock knock it’s ups
Try being an equestrian
Michelle is the real life barbie
The way the 'wounded' officer said "My leg!" When Michelle tripped had me DYING 🤣
Крутое видео получилось
Ram should be butt to hinge so you don’t break your wrist.
The guy in 4:23 sounds so much like Robert Downey Jr. right? I hope I'm not the only one hearing it that way lol, cause he sounds so like him- In 8:36 too, he sounds so much like RDJ..
4:58 michele got a +1 just now with this dude
I just eat McDonald and I see this at 7:39
This should be a Netflix show!
I LOVE that she does the actual drills for a decent amount of time. like the rappel, they could have just stopped when she made it through the window. But they stick to the drill and do it until she also sticks the landing. it's what sets these apart from a local news agency puff piece <3
Tried to do dea academy
bro said hands down
This is literally warzone but IRL😂
Comparing the job to a video game is dangerous and naive.
OMG Michelle
https://youtu.be/z9X5wd161rI
I like how after she  dropped him bro is like my leg my leg 20:18
SWAT academy? Do you mesn SWATcademy?
FBI
My toxic trait is thinking I could do this.
Oksy...this chick fun
You doing amazing 👍 Thank you 🙏 Love and greetings from germany 🇩🇪🥰
🤗🤔😗
I play Rainbow Six Siege
8:24 whats the music?
1:06 was that intentional or a mistake cuz uh you typed minimum was 85 and maximum 55 which is kinda wierd thinking what these words mean
"Any questions?" "No :("
Dam
I love your channel
michelle screaming at 17:04 after the flashbang 🤣
I love how likeable Michelle is, feels like every video she makes no matter how serious her trainers are she always manages to make them laugh
Cool😎👌
Yo nah this is live action Rainbow six siege 13:43
My life goal is to be a part of SDPD so thank you truly for showing me what to start to train for! I truly truly appreciate it!♥😎
wow
Fake
I don’t know why, but I get super excited while watching your videos.
if Michelle was a operator in a FPS game she would be OP and have to many perks.
you gotta give her props because there noway on earth i could do this . Michelle: Challenge Accepted. Me: Erm, Challenge Denied.
with all of the stuff she's done. if the world goes to shit in any way, she's gonna b the person that survives the longest
S=special W=weapons A=and T= tactic
Swat trainer: questions?  Michelle: no…
Try horseback riding
next one be in Scp foundation
Michelle! I've been binging your channel. 😆 I think your ice skating challenge prepped you mentally for so many of these! Well done!!
Probs to the supportive team!
77 seconds is so impressive Michelle!!!!!
FBI open up
nice breach Michelle but I think when u were blowing up the dooe a little bit raely
Her resume must be long lol
Her: yes lm sad: SLAY ALL DAYYYY
Excelente, saludos desde Panamá 🇵🇦👏👏👏👏👍

hahaha i love it when Michelle goes hey hands down!! 14:54 😂😂
Lol
xhwdheiuddu c
Michelle is America's Secret weapon now. 😂
Hands down? that was funny but i get that she is learning
14:51 "hands down!"
Well somebody got ptsd after this
When the final round popped up a beer ad popped up
i cant belive you
good job!!
14:36 yo Michelle looked badass in the gear 😤
Seek Discomfort brought me here! My first experience watching you and Michelle this was incredible, I admire your efforts and I’m truly inspired. Thankyou so much ❤
But that’s cool! Haha 😂
SHE'S SURVIVING THE APOCALIPSE 😌
6:02 music?
This and Fighter?!!! Wow! You’re an amazing woman!❤ new subscriber
She is like the female version of johnny sins: She's sway, she's secret service, she's ems lol
"We're going to do a two-officer carry, it'll be faster." As if she could carry a full grown man on her own anyway.
Hmm... All the same equipment, training and tactics as a full on military.. Wasn't there something explicitly prohibiting this thing? Posse Comitatus, standing militaries deployed in the US enforcing "law and order"...  Just as illegal as the massive surveillance and psychological operations our government conducts on it's citizens.
Ask them how many dogs they shot this year? It's more than you can imagine.
She has perfect time for adds! So funny!
How about trying out deep sea welding?
“It’s really embarrassing breaching an unlocked door” 😂
The begging stuff sounds like something I would do in P.E
We need the SWAT team from the 2017 series 🔥
She’s literally a r6 siege player
WW3?
Very good
What happens if u shoot the dog
? 🤬
War oops
Do airsoft eat or firefighting academy
Call of duty in real life
Bro took COD IRL seriously
okay.. the budget for this is... amazing
She Said Hands Down Hands Down LOLZ
Imagine if this level of professionalism was real and we would never need to hear about someone being swatted to death.
It's my birthday
This is why you respect SWAT, they have to do ALL OF THIS without (what I assume) a second chance. Michelle failed the majority yet actual legitimate members have to do the exercises and training procedures without error. Respect to our officers.
❤❤❤❤
The training looks so fun with the suspect on the tower!!!
A cool trying to be a terroris what not really just what I mean by that is military button the desert
I thought It's not allowed to record When your training...
This is pathetic
This is pathetic
6:50 *Clap Clap Clap*
Train in strip bar
Wanttt
why is there max amount for the sprint
I love how she said this is so heavy for 32 pounds. Also her casually lifting 180 pounds.
I stink you gonna be snike in the head
Hi.    😍
Dang, if someone ever breaks into her house they have another thing coming with everything she does
Its so fun watching you and also educative
“Hands down” 💀
13:18 wow only if i was talented enough and good enough so i can reach this part of training but im only 11 years old with nothing good about training like this but the rappelling even tho im scared of heights somehow if there is exiciment im semi scared i would have had done mission impossible music and go down pretty fast but not too fast
The way she jokes around😂
Imagine being a big time drug cartel leader and your warehouse is ratted out and when swat arrives and BANG someone rammed the door open and you see a 5'2" asian lady throwing out puns...but not even cool bad ass puns, like "knock knock, time to go to school!"
Do you are an indian
TRY LAWYER PLEASEE
after the army shit was tooooooooo EZ
pass your channel now and well, you got a subscriber
The instructor has no sense of humor
Videos of crazy
“right here in my beautiful illustration of a room”😭😭☝️
I love how the female swats(??) were like directing you during the course 😊
wow your good at this
Try hockey ice hockey not street hockey ICE hockey keep up the great work 😊
Btw that mean hello in Philippines
Kumusta
wow I want to be SWAT
"Suspect is surrendering" Intrusive Thoughts: *SEND THE DOG ANYWAY*
14:53 - S.W.A.T. - Special Weapons And Tactics 😂😂🤷‍♂ 15:25 - even better 😂😂😂
I watched this video senes 2022 its so cool
Why is flight attendant in the first responders
Do you wanna risk your life to Hardee’s crazy challenges￼
Come to Our fire department mississippi
That real life scenario challenge at the end was intense! Good job Michelle 👏🏽
Not disrespectfull ok!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT is so sweet how you react to the swat-things you do in Training!! AND you die it very very good!!!!! Really awesome!!!! Perfect instruction aß well!!!!!! Lpved to watch your awesome Job there! 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪😊😊
I’m more of a stealthy sniper person, I’d only pass the running, sit-ups, breaching, rappelling and- maybe the hostage situation- anything else if bomb Xd
Do you really get shot at or is it just fake shots w
Omg this must be fun and scary
Michelle: why not take a shot now? Sniper: he isn't a treat right now. Michelle: even though he already shot someone?  Based.
5000 cuts of film to make it dynamic hahah, make us a sandwich better
i did these before going to spec ops xD too easy
its always pullups thats hard but gotta give credit where credit is due
How exciting, learning how to become a MURDE RER
what if i do 20 pull ups i lose?🥋🤔
please test a French swat academy (the RAID) it's harder than the American swat it would be cool to see you in a French uniform XD
WHAT MOVIE IS AT 5:57 please I need to know…
Today the swat team was across the road at my neighbors home, they couldn’t open the door with the door knocker because it was a security door
So many difficulties you overcame. Proud of you. ❤
this girl is fucking insane
now try that in real scenarios 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bro plays too much
You should try horse back riding, show jumping
Yeah Michelle, I think you need to look back at your EMS video and learn how to apply a tourniquet
when a famous twich streamer goes live:
Michelle should settle for a job
Lol how she yelled hands down
I’d love to do this whole series like trying new things yes.
all of wher dreams got crushed
great use of tax money
Holy cow, such an amazing production. Looking forward to seeing Michelle in the creator clash 2!
I’d just breach it
TERRIFIC!
Those r Airsoft guns right 🤔
one time I was on vacation me and my family went to this Mexican restaurant 5 minutes after getting there we here people yelling and lots of lots of police and swats we saw people pointing guns at the windows my dad went to get his hand gun in his car incase anything happened the owner locked the door turns out a man with a gun went in to the apartment next to the restaurant and started shooting luckily they got him arrested and no one was hurt I was 8 back then and was terrified
My uncle Chad he is apart of the SWAT team is Arizona SWAT means : Special Weapons  And  Tactics
its gta 5 in real life
Bruh you are pretty amazing
She is so beautiful and I would love to meet her
Insane
Damn. That's badass!
What was the most physically challenging challenge accepted episode you’ve done
Jesus Christ Loves You All So So Much! <3
Guys and girls from this area and swat team, what would happen if you pas the maximum said in those boxes? Ive never seen a maximum requierment in a military or swat team qualification
She is badass
imagine she does a mission with real criminal gangs/terrorist gangs
I was in px izmir
Hey Michellle You Should Do LASD!
You should do the US Marshal training
when they were talking about the mcdonalds massacre, a McDonalds ad literally came right after that
I like the x files reference Fox Mulder and Dana Scully the FBI agents Names
Exellent swat
please try electricianing xD
This is not a military.
Bad training not bad people.
Simple slow down
If we look honestly less crime less intrusion more patience less force. 48 hours of sit and wait in the long term may create more love less hate. Highly trained people do not act without caution. Good😊
This is a lie. Swat was trained and equipped through the dump of non used government waste. You are listening to people that are receiving mot understanding what a violent culture we create.
Love this but to be clear this s really tough to comment on because I have three big young men/men now and one daughter tough, fast smart etc. yet on her best day she just cannot keep up with her brothers on her best day. She never quit but biological she is fit strong but not the same.  It was frustrating for her. And us as parents. As her body changed her performance change. Tough to watch.
Try doing self defense class for a video? msybe?
9:33 how mother’s wake you up be like
Okay...I'm hooked
Was it scary
Bro looks like Farah on call of duty when she took of her glasses 10:35
Imagine you try to kick the door but you miss and your team member say bro are you so weird the door is literally unlocked and you say oh I thought it was on locked
for a guy who has last name as rude it very rude
THINK FAST CHUCKLENUTS 17:07
9:02 In German this device is called: "Die Ramme".
Are you using Real guns what do you video and wagon subscribe
Are those rubber bullets?
Can you think about doing a vet
Special weapons and tactics
I cannot wait for the delta force practice💀💀💀💀
Swat/life or death moments: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED  Mexican house: CHALLENGE NOT ACCEPTED
Umm I Can't Tell If The Guns You Used On The Final Challenge Were Fake Or Real...
Isn't she so physically strong ! 💯
Please do sniper school
The most successful Youtube channel for someone that fails at everything they try.
FRAUDS LOL And their mommy too LO💪L🤣💪
Challenge urself as border patrol
FIRST TIME WATCHING THIS. AS A KID WANTED TO B A COP, BUT YEARS LATER ENTERED THE MARINE CORPS. HONORABLY DISCHARGED,  GOT INTO SECURITY (MANY JOBS).  APPLIED FOR CORRECTIONS. STOPPED BECAUSE EX-GIRLFRIEND CRASHED MY CAR WITH PAPERWORK OF CORRECTIONS INSIDE. NEVER APPLIED AGAIN. THE CLOSEST WAS WORKING AT A V.A. HOSPITAL WITH V.A. POLICE AS SECURITY. ALL IN UNIFORM FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT,  MAY GOD BE WITH YOU AND PROTECT YOU FROM EVIL. AMEN.
One thing I can say about the training scenario at the end is, the **bork bork**  K9 wanted his/her **nom nom** .  They were overly excited and was like 'Daddy let me play, pleeeeease.' but it was a job well done for what little training Michelle had, she just gets enough so that she doesn't look like an idiot in the scenarios for the final challenge.
Battle Drill 6.
14:53 not her saying hands down
Where is SGT Slaughter  ????
Can we agree if somebody tries to rob Michelle, they're in for a treat of, em abunch of stuff.
Fantastic 👊 👊 👊 nice 🙏🙏🙏🙏
CoD Irl? Nah, That's CS:GO irl.
It would be so wierd if she said challenge denied
The black thing is not called adore not you it’s called a battery ram
Her resume is GOD LEVEL SWOLE.
Hey Michelle! I wish I will be just like you because my name is Michelle and I am also Indian and I up for anything! Thank you so much for your inspiration!🎉❤😊
You would not expect michelle to use explosive breaching charges but here we are
HANDS DOWN
Pls try uk cops training to see a difference
My head hurts from the unfuniness, this video is literally made for 4 year olds to watch, there's just overflow of information so the toddler doesn't click off... Cringe... Don't recommend me this YouTube
At the end it looked like an movie
bro i feel bad for the enemy if she gets recruited in world war 3
this would be the dream playground for kids i personally used to climb in everything
Hey Michelle you must meet a k9 to see how smart and good
Surprised this girls isn’t Batwoman yet
michelle see's target   HANDS DOWN HANDS UP
❤ YOU ARE AWESOME!
I have been a swat
ESSA MULHER PARECE A MIA KHALIFA
Waiting spanish chanel
this makes me as milsim airsofter wanna be trained by them id love to have a shot at this^^
To the shooting i saw in youre videos i myself made weapon trainig course and it was really difficult concentrating the weapons had a strong pushback and on standing targets without stress it was already hard to make a proper shot i always imaginate how it would be you come to a scene having a suspect with a hostage and than you dont have much time to think no time to go throught the things you learned only seconds time for a desicion that must be really really hard you must avoid hitting the hostage shouldnt kill the suspect and that all in time with a gun that has a pushback under stress. And she hit his jaw 4 times and some bullets to the chest okay i know that was her first time i guess but wow it really shows under what pressure the Officer is standing otherwise the train every day so it will be makeble when trainig hard but a real situation will always be much much harder.
Im a security specialist we had a hard training too but often i think wow Policeman would have been much much harder im reallybhappy i made it into security guard it was good we didnt need to be so good in Sports like they have to be in Police or military otherwise i would not have made it i dont want to say oure career was easy you have to learn a lot of stuff in my job too but compared to Police or even swat it was much easier police was always a dream but my schoolgrades werent so good for Police and like i said sport would have been the reason i dont make it in germany you need A grade in Sport and language you have to be perfect in everything thats a little bit unfair sure they everywher look for the best of the best but in my opinion even are person with not so good Grades could still be a good Officer i once saw a person who had good grades in every subject but his social threatment with human beings was a desaster you can be super in every subject and still be unsuitable for the job.
here for the first time<3 AM SURELY GONNA BE A HUGE FAN OF U, Michelle
I wonder how much these guys spend on new doors to blow up
This reminds me of  rainbowsixsige\first person shooter
you must try vat69 at Malaysia
Michelle would be a amazing SWAT officer
I think the dog is the best swat member andddddd heDeserves a raise on doggy treats
SBI
In France training is way harder
You are so funny I did not know you were this funny 😂😂
You're brave! 😳
😳😳😳
You might have a blast playing ready or not now
imagine picking a fight with michelle😂 gonna be tough to win that one
I do this type of training often… Michelle do you anyone else laughing? This is serious stuff. Do you have a nervous laugh? 😅 I still love you because I know you do this for entertainment.🙂
Next challenge: pilot
2000000kkkkk$$$
Women☕
LIKE spider-Man No  Oh😢
Ur a girl bro why swat?
This is so cool
I've been rewatching some of your videos. I'm trying to restart weight training. You will never not be a huge inspiration
Congratulations, I really enjoyed your videos.
Call of duty in real life looks cool but hard
You are one strong person! GJ!
What if Michelle Were in the Real Swat? (Not In train)
call of duty in real life cracks me up!
I thought she was gonna wear black
Michelle swat is no joke they mean buissness
is this was real guns?
Imagine just a person was the bad guy and he had an ak ready to shoot and just sees a swat team breaching with a minigun lol
I would like to arrest me in the video with you?
I love what Michelle does, and huge respect from an EMT-  But damn girl, that tourniquet was hanging off the officer's foot by time he made it to medical lol
This is very interesting.
Breach unlocked door ... Finally someone saud it was stupid
I like push-ups
I now just want to try the obstacle course for fun
i wanna be swat or some sort of military personnel but i know that im not gonna survie training
love it
Michelle is now one of the deadliest people having secret service training, army, marines and swat holy shit.
8:44 "Good, Morning! You haven't payed your taxes!!!!."
When I want to join swat
OMG THATS SO COOL
Invisible camera man?but it is so cool
You should be a Drill instructor for next video
Swat is the German SEK ❤😮
The look on your face when you blew the breaching charge haha
I'm not impressed
she carried that 180LB dummy and then found it hard to hold the 32LB door knocker lol
That looks like so much fun to go through the training.
14:54 "Hey hands down hands up hand up!"
To me it's crazy how well she did for just 1 week of training. I've seen people doing worse in the Military with months of training under realistic simulations
She should try correctional officer training
New to this channel but this looks awesome chief!
yee
ok
im new to watching ur stuff and ur so funnny  u gave me aa free smile
I gotta respect that they let her retry the bounding into a window until she got it down!
Pro tip:  When breaching a door with a battering ram, always stand on the hinge side before swinging the ram.  Standing on the latch side can result in a broken wrist or forearm since the door will give and the doorframe will not.
Dude.  Seriously?  20 pushups is all it takes to get on SDPD SWAT?  USAF basic training minimum standard in the 1990s was 30.  Pullups, on the other hand, were only 5.  As a Security Policeman, I also had to do the Army PT test annually, because Security Police (now Security Forces) deemed the Air Force PT standards too weak for its members.  The Army standard for pushups and the rest was age based, and I believe it was something like 50 pushups in 2 minutes for my age group (I was in my 20s).  Keep in mind, the Army PT standard was for EVERY troop, regardless of their MOS.  That includes being an army cook.  So, for a SWAT team to require less... that's a bit concerning.  Just saying.
When she said I did not look down once I was thinking you may wanna do that
OUTSTANDING JOB.!!GIRL.
This video is giving me call of duty irl vibes
This popped up on my feed and it’s Worth watching.
Probs to her holy shit
How do you get all these amazing opportunities? Do you simply show up and say “Hey, I’m with YouTube, could I try out your training?” Because I’d love to do a channel like this :)
17:12 Oh No She ear seem like P-T-S-D
I should've been subscribed!!! Not only are these videos entertaining, but they are educational.
Jumping over a window mug feel like zero g🎉
My friend’s mom was in the military for April to November
Bro who r ur ops 💀
Is this fake cause the camara man is right there not getting shot
Bulova do the real criminal and they walk their house and then how are you just going to open it no more wait you have to breach it open
I think the swat team must go on my mum
U r damn amazing ❤️ im worried that y i didn’t identify ur channel till today🥺
What is Michelle's OnlyFans?
DO AIRBORN PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!
you should try dog sports. like dog sport competition
can you do army police. please
They showed her a bad way to manually breach the door. Whenever possible never use the ram from the same side as the lock. If it goes easier than you anticipated it’s a great way to break your arm or wrist on the door frame
You are so beautiful and cool.
everything you did was just like my pe class body slame and other things and you did  your amazing
Boring jk
so it's not your every day laser tag event down at the local laser tag venue then...
Women should not be police or military or fire fighters. FACT.
Call of duty is still better
your job is so fun hahaha
women shouldn't belong in combat roles
First girl to be swat
7:20 AYO THE AMAZON PACKAGE IS HERE WITH EXPO MARKERS BECAUSE YOURS IS DRYED OUT
Call of duty is easy just kill people and throw bombs and shit on some poeple
Video Idea : I tried world war
i LOVE your vids!!
this video makes me want to join the law enforcement more than the ads that they are showing lol
Imagine a parkour  guy doing this  He would say piece of cake for me
Thank you for sharing this wonderful experience with us Michelle! I enjoyed every second of it!
You look great :) Now you are skilled enough, come to Israel 😜
Incredible! 😃
i think anyone who plays CSGO should watch this!
"Eventhough he already shot someone..." we feel you Michelle but that's the world we live in...keep up the challenges
R6S???
🌺🌺🥀🥀❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
u such a dude just get the surgery how low u went i actually feel sorry for u
14:53 HEEY HANDS DOWN, HANDS UP!  criminal : well, which is it Michelle?! 🤣
Amazing michelle!
Swat that's good Oscar 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
Swat that's good Oscar 💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
@4:56 I like how he smiled at her knowing gun terminology when I have zero clue what was just said lol
I love you Michelle! Huge insparation!
These videos are all so interesting to me, because it makes me respect my dad so much.   He was a marine, on the swat team, and then deputy chief of police until he retired. I guess I never realized he was this tough since he was just my dad to me 😂  When I was in high school he would tell me that he could take down and run circles around any of the guys I dated even though he was in his 50’s and I definitely believe him now.
the pullups, only 6 as minimum? 15 years ago in highschool, it was required to pass PE to do at least 6 as minimum
It's just crazy to me how freaking strong she is
the swat: 😑  Michelle: 😁
Hey Michelle, you should fly to the UK and try out the SAS academy, it will be just for you if you’re up for another challenge
Super cool video! *This is my first time finding your channel and I just subscribed* 😊🙌
POV the camera man 😅 I’m Srry hahaaa
I use to work in the swat team, now I'm a nurse i got shot in my eye thats why i left:(
as a 180 lbs kid    haha
“goodmorning” LMFAO
When those breaching explosives went off, did you momentarily feel like a badass as you entered the building? I would..
imagine seeing a swat do the stunt she did at  14:00 LOL witnesses would be cracking up LLL
could you die in this?
Girls can do anything boys can
You should do a milsim airsoft event for a challenge accepted. Maybe get in contact with someone like desertfoxairsoft. Keep up the great content!
Wow great job 👍👍👏
this is the first video of hers I've seen but I'm really impressed by how much effort she put into trying challenging things. very positive attitude too!
After seeing almost all her videos you would expect her to be ripped! She’s so strong, love ya
Great videos.  Any chance you could eliminate profanity?
Wonder if she can try coast guard boot camp
17:08 that gotted me xd
You are so cool Michelle 👍👍👍
Great Thank you !👏 💞💞💞💞👌
Those instructors are less scary than some of my teachers ;-;
Do Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
I can’t tell if they shooting real bullets or if it’s rubber bullets or something 😭😭
No cap i would be a devious swat member cause i clear my corners
Your a brave woman you know that?
"Hands down ... hands up". That was funny 😂😂😂
Hi
You are born to be a SWAT
Wow ❤️❤️
R E T A R D S 😩😩😩😩
Woow Nice
She should try for bomb squad
I know
Good morning 9:41
Sw.ee.at.y Acad.am.emy
I’d wish you’d try me and accept my challenge baby 😂
swat teams sind widerwertig. die erschiessen deine haustiere als erstes wenn sie bei dir einreiten
Is this real
That looks like a normal Saturday for me with my airsoft unit and yes we scare our Swat teams
.
The only things I’m good at is running and pull ups... I wouldn’t make it
Why was she joking so much and not taking it seriously? She’s usually very “sober minded” on challenges but she kept making cringey jokes.
just heard about the 1984 McDonald's massacre from this video, that's such a horrific tragedy.. and unfortunately, history keeps repeating itself
i like that obstacle course, but is that astro turf in the low crawl portion always there?  Definitely don't want to be like Wile E. Coyote, because he always blows himself up.
"How do we land? Like Spiderman?" Okay she's adorable.
14:54 she said hands down
I did this i tried that...stop making it all about you
I love ur videos
.9
bro the pov scenes look like some game like call of duty or something LOL
She did a great job! Just need to cut off the flagging 😂 puker factor lol
😲😲
Michelle’s fear of height has gone down she rappeled down so fast
The only one I’ve watched was the secret service and swat
only half of the viewers are subscribed
you almost had a full movie
You should try Airsofting
I LOVE THE FLASHBANG
0.0 kdr in a 13.04 kdr team  get it?
1:32 you’re lucky you can complain 😂
oh bullshit like you did the ACTUAL training and not the DIVERSITY HIRE womans training! DO THE MENS TRAINING oh wait you cant! what a load of shit.
Nice video 📹
I am not scared if the height but I am scared of the floor
Michelle I wish I could do that because I’m super fast
she should be classified dangerous
I love your challenges .😅am a daredevil person too😅
Q talento👏👏👏9
I can def do that circuit in 4 maybe not pull ups bc I suck at it
“knock knock”😂
Super jealous she had a DD mk18 SBR.
u need to do 20 pull ups t start SWAT training
Lol she said hands down
Is it just me or is she the absolute hottest swat operator in existence ❤
"but that;s kewl. Ok fine, clear. " I just died LOL.
Hermoso lugar
Me encata ese trabajo.
Michelle's true skill is her ability to "disarm" super intense people with her wit and hilarity. She's so damn funny it's so great to see all these serious professionals relax into their goofy sides.
Magnífico trabajo
Yo I would love to go with u on one of your awesome adventures
J
1:05 pov camera man
michelle is having fun
14:40 mogger outfit
I think you'd do awesome in border patrol, bounding lifegaurding ( I believe that's in Australia though), a state park ranger or officer or maybe prison guard. That would be so cool.
As someone who is currently in certification for becoming a doula, I would love to see you try and be a doula or midwife for a day (or however the challenge works).
She could qualify for so many different careers from all the training she has gone through with her challenge accepted videos
"To end that friend"
She is an inspiration to others
Increible
said hands down lmao
why is there a maximum for the sprint, is it just the fastest somebody got?
I have done the repelling move while camping, so cool when you're coming down because you get to slide down - very hard when you're going up!
michelle is pretty strong, such a vibe!
gosh, this would be so awesome to try out!
this girl is so freaking awesome omg
I have a question, what if the bad guy stand right behind the back of the door? Or if he stands right next to the door, when the door was opened, the door could slam into his face?
Bro cover me Michelle cover me YOUR NOT EVEN MOVING AND POINTING THE GUN UP😭😂😂
I think i flew a plane into yalls swat car in GTA
She is talking about looney tones in swat training 😂😂😂
👍👍👍👍👍👏
🤗🤗🤗
When she reacted to the flash bangs it looked like she was having Vietnam war flashbacks😂😂
Michelle, You haven't air dropped into a forest fire yet.  Just brain storming.  And sky diving is a great way to handle a fear of heights.
Es muy peligroso,  pero interesante
No😢😅
You're the best lol I follow your page love it
Always check the doorknob first folks...unless you're in Uvalde
I would say, at that drill going in the room where was hostages and suppose to YELL GET DOWN!! she just said low voice get down. I know myself that adrenaline get up and my voice would get loud. PUT THE GUN DOWN, PUT THE GUN DOWN OR WILL SHOOT. It is same thing when I'm coaching womens american football team. I would like to get quarterback LOUD but nooo, low voice. And yeah. I coach womens american football team here in Finland.
women
It's like call of duty
😍🥰🥰🥰🥰😍🤩😘🤪😜😛🤣
I think they are going to have SWAT on next world cup like security in 2026 that is in Mexico,canada and USA
Girls gonna be a grandma telling her grand children "I was in every kind of law informants teams"
😀😃😄😁😂😃
How do you not have over 10 mill subs your incredible
POV: Me using the door knocker   Me: honey, I’m home
try space force
Join the uk army
TRY JOINNING THE NBA
Meliterii   plisss
U do too much push up. Should save some energy for 6 pulls up. Just complete the minimum req
Amazing video again
😆 it’s  Amazing
Once everything acc is  finished in 10 years what next?
No way she'd ever free climb or cliff camp
i really want to see you do the navy seals training in one of these videos. or maybe the danish "Jægersoldat" training.
ooo i live in sd
Are they using actual bullets😅
👍👍
7:54 It demonstrated, that you need better gun laws, so theese things happen less often. "Oh ItS FoR pRoTeCtIoN iN tHeEsE cAsEs" stfu how many times did a regural person help in theese cases? Im not saying its not happening, but its rare, and not worth it.
this is like unus annus except forever
😊😊😊😊
“HANDS DOWN!”  *“If you say so!”*  💥  💥 💥
hu
It’s funny how elite forces can’t use a tourniquet correctly. You are only supposed to use a tourniquet if the bleeding is uncontrolled and not stopping.
Gay
The KABOOM😂 5:57
Man, this San Fran SWAT training was so different than Will Tennyson’s SWAT training in Round Rock TX!! Especially the jokes and banter between Michelle and the officers
BROOOO it always gives me chills when Michelle says "challenge accepted". The amount of things you do is honestly astounding. I'd love to do anything like this!
"But that's cool" at 7:11 is said in the cutest way possible, I am obsessed!
😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😮😮😮😮😮😮
Hello sorry that I door rammed your door
What I've learned from this video is that like 99.99% of the time you HAVE to have good teamwork.
OMG I’m so surprised you go to the squad academy😢
subscribe
.
Nice 👍🏻
Very beautiful illustration of a room
🤩
how is this not a "netflix/whatever streaming service you want" series yet
While I was watching the video I wanted to give you a comment so when the door is locked you shoot the door handle and then you kick the door open
Tough young lady. I’m impressed.
This is a risked I am so proud I can’t say anything
14:54 Michelle the HANDS DOWN!! got me i think thats the funniest thing out of most of the videos lol keep up the good content!
This woman takes documentaries to the next level and I'm honestly surprised that she doesn't have her own app/website. Or at least even more subscribers Edit because autocorrect decided to completely change my sentence
the fact that this could be a real life situation, and Michelle has just opened the door with a 32 pound weight and just goes “Good morning!!!”
You are the best
The explosion charge is when you cut a wire and sets off the bomb the say fire in the hole to keep the area clear from the bomb to keep the swat members away from a little radiation
Usually a door knocjer aka a battering ram is 1,0000,0000,0 pounds to break down the door
When you use the gun it's important to not  Point it at each other it doesn't matter if it not loaded or anything you still need to practice gun safety
18:01  That woman is an Amazon. I want.
👌
It baffles me that Michelle does not have her own Netflix special, TV Show, etc. This stuff needs to be seen by more than just YouTube. Well done Michelle. My brother served with S.W.A.T for 20 years and you did amazing.
What happens if you do the sprint too fast?
I wonder, Why do you do this? like i love watching this but what do you get out of this? Do you get extra skills? Whats the benefit
i want to be on the swatt team military so iexciting
“It’s like a ghost hunting show” then 6 months later she is in a ghost hunting show with Sam and Colby
Just  Curious on the sprint time you said a maximum off 55s and a minimum of 85s shouldn't it be minimum 55s and a max of 85s not hating just curious why you did it that way
9:34 that grin is just priceless like imaging thats the last thing you see before getting your brains plastered on the wall
hi
You're so lucky all these places let you do this and give you the time to give you some training.
By far best video i have seen it was a banger
After watching these I would trust Michelle to be on my zombie apocalypse team
Have you went to a state patrol Academy
I love how she jokes around all these serious people, it’s definitely something I would do :)
ℕ𝕚𝕔𝕖 𝕧𝕚𝕕𝕖𝕠
@20:40 the dude's TQ falls off his leg lol.  Nice application lol.
Bro the last part was a whole movie
It’s funny seeing how you compare serious things to funny things
A female join the squad team is a very strong woman like Michelle, she can do anything just like men
👍👍👍👍👍
Que inteligentes
Use your mind more jk your mind is already strong champion 🥇🏆
how much do swat make cause i can max out on all of these idk about the last training but if it pays good
17:14 Questions? Michelle (timidly): no…
That was a sniper on sdpd swat San ysidro McDonald's right by the post office. The glare prevented the sniper from getting a shot I remember that hit the news like no other Newark talked for days about that event.
👍
😯😯😯
this woman is the most brave woman ever i swear
they planted A them cts aint got shit
Increible trabajo realizan 💪💪💪
Impresionante
Michelle, did they talk about how long they keep their people in place before relieving them?  It’s such high stress and for so long!
Interesante
18:04 The biggest scenario
😄😄😄😄😄😄
For  Arabs nothing is difficult😂
21:44 it depends on where your at if your In a city that is out to criticize their police. They won’t take that shot but in idk some rural county in Kentucky and your the sniper for the sheriffs dept given the scenario he would have taken the shot given that opportunity.
☺️☺️☺️
I’ve seen her Chanel for a while now. The 911 operator, nailed it, she could do that for a living. Swat team?? Hmmm … imagine the scenario, “Michelle blows the door up, comes running in and says ‘surprise, everybody wear pink now, the coyote is here!’ ” … 🤦🏻‍♂️
He was swat team leader
My grandpa was is the swat team to
Buen entrenamiento
I'm on a binge because I just discovered Michelles channel last week thanks to a random bootcamp video and I have to say that I love her format. I saw these kind of videos from other youtubers already and suddenly it became very clear that Michelle is basically the godmother of this format. You are clearly many steps ahead with the quality and effort you put in! My favorite videos so far were 911 dispatch, police academy and marine bootcamp.  But to be honest, this video rubbed me the wrong way. I first thought that this must be one of her older videos and she was super nervous thats why she was cracking so many jokes.. but nope, this is a rather new one. All these references, quips and jokes, "its like dancing"," its like Wile e Coyote", "Spiderman?", "Call of Duty in real life!!" seemed rather disrespectful and like you don't take their job sersiously.  I do understand that she has a joyful and easy-going personality and as a youtuber she is used to comment on things, but in this video I found it to be too much.
I just found it and great video. I respect all the employees. How about CIA, Bus Driver, Taxi driver or train engineer
Try pro football
😃😃😃
Eres increíble,  power woman
Hahaha 👍🤝
Can you do a K9 video? That would be so cool.
The amount of varied experiences this woman has... :'D
good job. michelle Khare
I would try so hard to not laugh there
can you try being a baseball player it takes incredible endurance and it makes your calves hurt but I still want you to try it pls do it
At this point she should have abs 😂

The people who shoots McDonald’s school those people play gta too much

Poor door
Just watching that was so fun
You know how it's a real scenario at the part near the end, and it's quite kinda maybe sorta little dangerous. Have you ever thought about the cameraman?
👍
💪
🎉🎉
Genial
Omg😭
I love watching your videos they are amazing 🤩
Poor Michelle I feel so bad for her just screaming when that bomb exploded
Please try air force acedemy
I really love you and i realy wish that i can meet you i really loved your personality you are just like me  really love to accept hard challenges! Love you🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡🧡
I'd love to do this course just for fun
Not my toxic trait thinking I could do this
Here in Brazil it is so difficult to be a police officer, I find it incredible how the policies of the United States of America have high level support and training and one of the coolest, they manage to promote content for citizens to see the profession.
Que valentía
😃😃😃
that was so cool!
Were those real guns?
Que  chistoso
That was awesome! These people are the real professionals
Amazing series!
THE MAXIMUM SECONDS YOU CAN GET IS 55!? YOU CANT GET LOWER THAN THAT?!
do a cia academy
You're so lucky to do this
AHHH MY LEEEEGGG
she is so beautiful I wanna cry
what is the bridge my house for no reason
They were cringing non stop
10:05  while you were saying Looney Tunes, the face of that guy behind u looks like he's ready to do tons of damage lol
What rifle is that?
👍
💪💪👍👍👏👏
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk 🤣
Bald Ryan Renolds
That looked intense! Well done!  The obstacle course looked like a really fun “parkour park”. 🙂
Thanks very much for the sharing. This to me is really like "Call of Duty" in the real life situation scenario. Amazing team work and strategy. Good work on everything and keep it up! God bless and take care. Cheers!
最高
Someday❤️
👍👍👍👍👍💯
LMAO ARE U GUYS CALLİNG THİS TRAİNİNG SO FUNNY
Are they using Airsoft guns?
I feel bad for the officer she dropped, I know it’s a drill but that looked painful the way he hit the gravel
Are we gonna just ignore the fact that she took off before he said “go” at 0:55?
She's such a child lol.
That was crazy, good job 👌👌👌
I knew that there was alot that went into the SWAT teams but I was still amazed seeing their skill, technique and procedures!!!
😎💪
pls dont go to my house
Wooow
Exelente 👍👍👍
Need more swat in every district
i want SWAT academy
I have never seen you make so many jokes in one video 😂 you are hilarious
APRES TU REGARDE TT LES FILM ET SERI DAVANT 2004 SA EISTE PAS LE SWAT
Not only is she changing OUR point of view for these amazing hero’s, she’s also changing the way men see us that we can do just as much I love you and look up for you!!
Exelente
Jesus loves you

im just now finding this chennel and im already loving the content subscribed for sure
Okay, the obstacle course. I would freaking die on that lol props to people who can do this. I would be WHEEZING.
The only thing that bugged me was the lack of actual combat first aid for the shot officer. Tourniquet might not of been the only choice.  He should of had or been able.to apply it him self with his own medic bag on his kit lol
Are u Indian or Hispanic?
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽💯
The thumbnail
Fake lol
Back when I was a teenager I was in the invisible stage and I would do this.
were these real gunshots??
👍

Mẹ tôi ở trên vẫn gọi tôi là đức vua chúa cha chúa chủ tổ toàn năng toàn ngôi toàn vũ trụ là tôi là Cậu Ấm bởi vì âm lớn nhất và dương lớn nhất toàn vũ trụ tôi chỉ  sống ở bình thường như đứa bé con ở trong bụng mẹ là không được lạnh quá cũng không được nóng quá
Ai ngờ tôi lại bắt được con gà to khủng ở ngoài đường được xe ô tô chạy quá chừng luôn mà không ai bắt thà chạy đạp chết chứ không ngừng xe ô tô lại bắt vậy mà tôi lại bắt được nó to khủng vậy là tôi không phải mất chi phí nào mua con gà ăn bởi vì con gà ở trên xe bây về đất để gặp tôi để tôi đêm về ăn
Chào ha tôi tập bắt con rắn to khủng hoảng rất kinh khủng lắm luôn phải to bự vậy mà nó hung dữ kinh khủng lắm luôn nó đưa đầu đoài đớp lấy tôi luôn mới nảy đây thôi vậy mà không có ai bắt được
When swat breach she said knock knock then the bad guy says who’s there? then she says SWAT TEAM
The dummy is like the FD training because you have to carry people as FD
When I was applying to the CHP academy I passed my physical ability test but I failed my written exam … this videos motivated me to continue the process, study harder and not give up , thank you I hope to see more videos like this more often .
HOW ARE BOYS GONNA DO THE WALL OR THE WİNDOW YOU BALLS ARE GONE NO MORE BABYSS
Your content is freaking cool 🫶🏻 Keep doing this challenges, it gives us another perspective on out heroes 💪
Russian special forces СОБР of the Russian Guard held the defense in Balakliya for 2 days and left without loss.  this is the real spetsnaz
Am I the only one who used to turn on the car light and say "flashbang!!"16:53
I feel like if your swat you ears are going to be SO damaged by the end.
The SWAT trainers were pretty serious.  I think you were a little put off by how serious they were.  It was a good experience, though.  Rappelling exercises are so different from when I was in the Army.  Now, people seem to prefer to use rigging of various kinds to reduce the possibility of a mistake when connecting to the line.  It's a good idea.
Really sick, I LOVE IT A LOT rainbow six siege in real life, especially when he starts giving the briefing of mission, OOO MAN i want to do it
I've been doing SWAT Academy for some time, then I was training hard and those many stuff,  I could just be with the SWAT for 59 hours! I started to get stronger I was the top SWAT in the academy though.
Bro is purple in the thumbnail...
Batman
This was so cool. You can do anything and it's great to see you take on these challenges and concur any fears.
P
Did you die
Even tho im a boy or a kid i love these vids
This is the first Michele video I saw
Women
Falwja remember's 🤣🤣
These guys are legit hero's.  So professional, highly skilled!
Excellent
Your good at that
14:21
I like the dog part
THIS IS SO COOL
For me you just are my inparation that i can do anything in life u just have to believe it good work
Good job wow
"Call of Duty irl" wow
I sub
Nice vid!
You should try CHP academy
the desert eagle
and my favorite pistol is
the ak-47
and there is my favorite assault gun
like the dragon nov
did u know i love guns as specially ranged guns
Idk why but I just love your content so much and just wanted to say keep it up
she so fine but W swat
You are amazing Michelle.   I think you can be all you want to be.
Michelle you are so amazing. 🤩 My mother served in the Marines as Combat Correspondence. She's a total badaZZ. Maybe you might like to check it out.
This is that one girl that wanted to quit bootcamp in the first day isn't she?
15:17 airsoft players can do better i think
I love the way she said "call of duty in real life is hard " it reminds me when my best friend that went to Marine boot camp for 1 or 2 months i forgot the days but the day he texted me i was so fu*king happy i wanted to see him he texted me one day on his phone and said "call of duty in real life was so ass" i died laughing so much its a little story probably no one will care about but i had to tell you it :D
I feel like no one has shown her how to do the 6ft or 8ft walls. She keeps doing a double leg jump right before it. What she should be doing, is attacking the wall. You run up and you want to shove your foot into the wall and push your up. You attack the wall. You don't just run, stop and jump. Push that foot intot he wall.
These are so cool and I love watching them
thats why women shouldnt do this stuff and the conclusion is we're not equal to all feminist thinkers.
Michelle why dont you try the LAPD academy, someone says that it's the most difficult police academy in the country
Don't mess with this woman.
Is it fake or real
*tryna not to laugh*
bruh thats a daily day in greece
Hands down lol
who gets to be the terrorist? cant the actors just go full rambo everytime during training? do they get special treatment for not dying?
Would have been cool if they swatted a streamer for some realism
Bro who is this girl. I been on a 4 episode binge. She had me at the marines training, she’s a badass mofo
I'm sorry but your voice is so non-threatening 😗
Can someone help me out with what uniforn they were wearing on 6:24 and where to buy then?
I love your videos can you be a doctor truck worker
You join the firefighter Squad
How do you felt like in that case scenario
I think you should try to be to US Coast guard
Man, this is so cool to watch and interesting to see how they train.
This remind me of Call of duty tbh
Next episode: I Tried Being a Cloaker
Try Chicago police
Will you try a end academy
ok so when using the charge to break the door open they get closer. but ik this is real and they want everyone to be safer and whatnot
19:00  "This is the AK-47 assault rifle, the preferred weapon of your enemy; and it makes a distinctive sound when fired at you, so remember it."  (Gunnery Sergeant Highway-Heartbreak Ridge) One of my all time favorite Clint Eastwood films bytheway. 😉😁
18:47 Looks like she lost a small strap there. Came flying off when she turned her head back toward Michelle. 😳
You know I don’t think blowing up a door with hostages inside is a good idea
Thank you for sharing these great videos Michelle! I'm retired military and can tell you that the biggest problem females have during physical training is in their upper body strength.  It can be developed  overtime but you have to stay on it or you will lose whatever progress you may have made. Personally, I recall doing training 5 days a week. No training during weekends and felt it come Monday. My achilles heel was running. Never failed a run but sometimes struggled to keep my run up to standard.
Imagine running that course in full kit. Not so sure as many people would make it.
Not sure if those push up were done correctly. 😉😁👍
i wanna try when i grow up 😁
14:54 HANDS DOWN HANDS UP
Repelling was fun.
Now thinking about this I guess this is how swat teams are pretty strong especially you need to do this for years and I never knew swat team were in comic-con
We’re they actually using real bullets cuz I coulden’t tell
hi
Wow 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
You did an excellent job Michelle in your SWAT training as a real soldier woman. You are truly a heroine Michelle. I'm proud of you
9:40 howdy neighbour!
fun video Michelle. Good job.
Michelle: Ooh, just like Wile E Coyote!  SWAT: yep Michelle: So, like Spiderman? SWAT: pretty much Michelle: Call of Duty is much harder in real life!  SWAT: sure is
Did you have experience already? Your movement seems very good.
Please go and work at a boba shop
These vids are fire!!!!
dream job
Honestly this is my favorite episode because of SDPD since SD is my hometown and I’ve always been interested in anything that deals with special operators. lol if this episode were three hours long, i would watch the entire thing without hesitation because your content is amazing as always. Also officer/operator Stephanie is a baddiieee tho 😂🔥👀
bruh is that rainbow six saige?
After watching this video, I'm really impressed at how damn accurate that Ready or Not game is. Damn
boom there goes the door
You could tell these guys loved her it was so sweet to watch
Army boot camp
It is just awesome
I love you're videos❤
they're playing Rainbow Six Seige irl.
I think one of my teachers passed in the LV one, She was a great one
the camera man faster
Cops should not be allowed to be equipped with military grade weapons and gear
how about becoming a professional dancer for a day?
Just think about this, the SWAT is more well equiped than most armies on Earth.
Kinda reminds me of Metroid blast from Nintendo land
i hope those guns they used were airsoft guns or some kind of non-lethal firearm
6:40 “Like your dancing! Dancing partners!” “I wish I had a different partner.” “ *scoff* “
was that mission with Chris a real mission
Lmao see does it all.
Bro, this woman is amazing, lol not gonna lie I would love to do what she does :)
Damn Michelle in this one was making me smile, super cute! She did a good job considering she only had a few months of training, rather than years of constant training like most.
That fitness test is easy af
When you get an advert just before they blow up the door:
Ok now I know I want get in the army
Can you co a hospital worker pls
POV:your using airsoft
She’s the real life barbie
I nay be wrong but i think these are very realistic bb guns
these videos are too high quality for its own good
hi
I wonder if they have to re-do these training tests every few years, or if theres like a fitness regimen they all have to follow. im curious to see how they keep up/hone the skills after acceptance
I want to play rainbow six siege after watching this
I’m sorry for you loss chief
the most hard thing about this is Arestting people and trying to keep the world safe and Putting people in Hospitals and like making people to want play this job And when people playing this job we have people facing There fear And helping the people that are Unciousness is the most imoporting thing and When you train the swat training Is Really Fun but in real life is scary and hard work is amazing but the scary thing about this getting shot and arestting crimanals is so scary but is imoporting to us And trainers and we are happy for michelle
What's the name of the other SWAT woman? she's so pretty 😁
You are very super inspiring
she should do  the england rugby team
Try US Marshal
“Clear” “all clear” “last room” “let’s go” that was so cute hahaha
She’s basically Barbie. With all these jobs. Good for her.
My uncle is a swat member
just play cod boom you can even end the swat team
bro this is so easy
Interesting, it's quite different from Germany. Here SWAT teams are not allowed to show their faces and all personal details are secret. They also wear more body armour (always larger vests, always helmets with bullet-proof glass visors etc.)
She's like the mix of inner-child and SWAT Team Member.
Your so pretty and strong and motivate yourself each day enough to in the end do this!! Bless you Michelle
You can say fbi open up.
How about NCIS academy next
try something in the idf in israel (idf = israel defence force) pls michelle
Would almost be more terrifying. Loud noise, door is breached...happy cheerful morning person. *shudders*
“good morning!😃”   *proceeds to arrest them*
D
Airforce academy: challenge
actually maybe all of them
the first training course is like a calll of duty map
Are u scared
Can u pls go to air force academy
Why does she make the training look so fun I mean some of it probably is but now I wanna join the swat🤣🤣🤣
Good IM love you
Does Michelle know that during push-ups, you're not supposed to actually touch the ground?
Dude is a bald Ryan Reynolds
very noice
I wanna try this I've always felt like I have the potential to be a cop maybe swat too
1:46 Shouldn't he have said, "the obstacle course needs to be *run*...?"
i really enjoyed this video! you do well in everything despite trying it for the first time. well done!
The tank thingy at 5 min and 45 seconds was in die hard the movie
The only thing left for you to do is run for President
yep dream job
There more physical training than there is mental training, ..That why american used 100 bullet for 1 person while others used 1 bullet 1 person
im the 130k like
how do you get clearance for thigs like this. Cause I wanna do this
How where you able to do these things did you have to pay the swat to do this thing
why is a WOMAN trying to attempt swat academy 💀
Don't accidentally throw the Flash grenade Into the babies crib... or do tax payers will cover it.
Me: I'D LIKE TO GO THROUGH YOUR SWAT ACADEMY   Swat: LOL  Attractive girl: I'D LIKE TO GO THROUGH YOUR SWAT ACADEMY   Swat: YOU BET
😭im simping
That is scary
honestly trying every single army thing and police thing can actually save ur life in the future or in a emeregency
8:55 funny how uvalde pd didnt do that...
Can we have a swat video but with Dc Police
She can legally kidnap somebody and since she’s swat it’s called a detainment
You're really pretty :)
Ladies and gentlemen We got em
Bro she’s cute AF and not just her looks.
Been watching you for YEARS,Keep on grinding!
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Women moment
Just imagine her job résumé under special skills : has done swat, FBI, 911 dispatcher, marine Boot Camp, police training and this are just ones I can remember on the top of my head
12:44 ouch
She just aimed it at his head with the weapon position I think
and yeah
7:07
I've always wanted to join the S.W.A.T even though im british. Nice job!
shes been doing these fitness challenges forever and still sucks hard at pull ups
Try therapy
The Pentagon--the CIA and MI6 from 1945 to 2022, sparing no money , revive fascism -Nazism all over the world and arm 100 % of world terrorism from Needles to Ukrainian nationalists (((( And sow death - hatred and murder for the next World War
Try professional tag it’s a sport now
How does Michelle get people to this? I feel like SWAT would be like "lol no" when they get approached by a youtuber
How much money they spend in fake explosive door?!
Is it me oh she looks like young in rainbow six siege
me like swat
like im stronger than this girl and im 13 years old 13. and every girl says we are stronger than men here is an exampel
no hating but wtf was those pushups
its funny the people that are scared of guns do the dumbest shit with them!  awesome job  flagging your instructor like 20 times
For me the entry thing is just entering and clearing corners in vallorant with teammates
Makes your day smile even though the training should be serious xD.
So wild.
You re lovelly michelle i like your caracter
Do army bomb defuse training
I swear she's so dedicated to these videos
Hi I'm from the fbi  can you try fbi
what 😱
"I Tried Al' Queda Training" that'd be a good title
POV: CS:GO in real life
i went to fbi academy once, accidentaly killed a person...
WOMEN☕☕
I think they should of checked him for explosive under his jumper.
try about welding
This content is literally gold content
I hope you do WWE next
One question for you, Michelle. Are you usually peaceful or violent? Because you really impressed me and inspired me to work on room clear and breaching tactics.
Please try border patrol academy!!!
I enjoyed the video but I don’t think that the training she was taking part in was the place to be making those jokes. Saying that a training course that in the real world has caused many deaths is like a Animated show seems to be in poor taste, then again it’s just a video and the officers didn’t seem to be upset
My sis is athletic
i thought it would be good but it isnt and the discord link deleted my files
20 DAVID TO COMMAND
i wold love to be in the swat
Become an FBI agent
anyone know exactly what kind of radio sounds like that at 18:19
On a quarter mile sprint I got 57 seconds and I’m 12
"Call of duty in real life"  Spoken like a true warrior
imagine the k9 unit attacks the swat team
This is great!  I just LOVE channel. You are bad a##!!!  Do one one criminal/forensic investigators! :-) Keep it up girl!
bin gay
training same same liek soldier
That's a bit too informative, considering the video can be easily discovered by criminals
The one that is teaching the team stuff Looks like Ronald Reynolds
What happens if they can shoot through the wooden door while putting on the bomb?
OHHH I LIKE THIS
ok but how u guys using real guns tho
elite special forces: that was EZ
So wait im confussed was it real guns but shooting blanks or was it airsoft with a tracer unit?? what i mean is at the end when you guys where doing the sinerio
Try SAS
Omg rainbow six seige is real
We’re those real bullets??!
Bro you have earned a new subscriber this is the best video I have seen so far
Pt.2
Can you please try mp
She is a baddie 🙀🙀
This is so sick!!!!  Michelle is living the dream ...
How old are you I want to join the SWAT
Imagine “I tried a real SWAT mission”
lol I live in SD
Back when you did police training i recomended swat training
Seeing here doing the obstacle course shed be crazy good in a movie 100%!
These obstacle courses look fun.
i love how she said hands down
Teacher: what do you want to be when you grow up?    Michelle: uhm- a Disney princess, part of the fbi, a lifeguard, part of the army, 911 dispatch, flight attendant-    Teacher: 👁👄👁
I swear I saw her on a State Farm ad
I don't want to be mean, but she was not holding that rifle correctly. You could have snapped your collar bone if you actually fired because it was held up in the shoulder instead of the pocket
854
Literally reliving my childhood dream job thru you! As a little girl i wanted to be apart of the SWAT team. Sadly that dream didnt come true but I love seeing what it would’ve been like.
Are these videos meant for like do it at home or
Nice
wait was that a osprey the helicopter  plane
Don't die!!!
If I wanted to try special weapons and tactics training how do I do it
I’m actually quite impressed at how well she did
YOO THIS NEW RAINBOW SIX SIEGE UPDATE BE LOOKING SIIIIICCCK MY DUUUDDESSS (joke)
The officers lacking emotional intelligence while Michelle having creating a positive mood.
Im so happy that you push yourself to do these insane challenges good job
Omg her smile when she's wearing the swat helmet might be the cutest damn thing I've seen in a while lol
8:05 is that an RCXD?
wow  if you dont deserve likes and hella views, I do not know who does.
She is the same as me I will call everything cool
She is the same as me I will call everything cool
#back to kitchen
i  put you forward to go on the hall of fame/inspiration in a university in the UK!!  i think you deserved it xx
This is fucking awesome dude wow
what firearms are you using to make them so realistic
If I was a swat officer and kicked the door in me be like swat modfucker
Personality so nice
Go do tiktots instead
@Johnni Gade Reaktioner
that looks fun
You should try riot police
Shes Trying So Many Intresting Jobs. im Gonna Be A Official Subscriber
you should do a video where you try to be a K9 Handler for a day.
Hands down 😂
I came to know you from nas daily
I live in Las Vegas
I remember call of Duty Task Force 141
Him: Questions? Her: *Sigh * Nyooo
Qualifying for the ulvade swat team would be pretty easy
What about USAFA
Why does the Swat look like the military🫤🫤🫤🫤🫤
nice beautiful!!!
Dude I could never that puppy would distract me so bad 😂
6:59 pause it right at that time
Bruh, as soon as the Mc Donalds part comes up. An add pops up and says Did you know our burgars are made of 100% candaian beef?
One of Theese Days Shes Gonna Get Hurt.
I can't wait to watch this one! So glad I found the channel ☺️
The dummy looks light but in person carrying it it’s really heavy👍🏻
The cool part was when you were walking with a whole swat team behind you😂
POLICIAL. S....A)))S.T.A...N.... INTERNACIONAL S....A.🇧🇷🇯🇵🇰🇷🇱🇷🇲🇾🇺🇸🇫🇷🇱🇷🇬🇧🇦🇲🇺🇸🇳🇱
Can you try Airsoft
It's crazy how SWAT has better equipment and stuff than the Marines
I feel like they are nicer than the bootcamp
11:21 she so small.  she looks so cute 🤣
OMG I WANT TO BE SWAT
I like how they ignored the camera man
This is like valorant when in the final stage you throw the grenade to the hallway is like one of valorant things but nice vid
WW2 is cooler
Cool
I’ve watched you for awhile and like your content but you’ve become way too silly and goofy in these videos. It’s like your target audience is young children. You used to act more mature and take things more seriously but now the videos seem to have this goofy joking undertone which just doesn’t work with some of these Challenge Accepted’s you are doing. It’s almost disrespectful to the professions when you act so silly considering how serious their job and training is. I’m sure these guys had to bite their tongue quite a bit with all the childish remarks and jokes you were making when they were trying to teach you serious tactics. It’s was very cringe to watch at times.
I challenge you to be a helicopter rescue paramedic
I challenge you to try wrestling at the Olympic Training Center.
I challenge you to try wrestling at the Olympic Training Center.
can u still solve the cube
If you did that I would be scared for my life
Excellent spirit
Some serious job that Michelle passes off as a fun game lol, i love when youtubers get into this stuff 😆
love the jokes
The repelling looked like SO much FUN!!!
5:44 true true 😂
You should try being tased, it's more exciting!
Love your channel always dreamed to be a swat g man myself
High Port?  Ch... Check bayonet?
that looks hard but you got through it🦾
gotta be honest i wanna try the obstacle course in 3:57
Knock* knock* Michelle's here! Good morning!  😆 🤣
20:20 trickshot!
was the last part real  Michelle  cause am  confused?
what if you got hekkin shot from army  academy
Oh shit
Love from India
I'm glad they brought up the funnel of death. Everybody needs to know that about hallways and doorways,etc.
jsuis vraiment desoler pour euh les pauvres
Why did they send the dog first 😢
Oh that's the lady who still looking for a career, good luck lady.
Massive respect to the SDPD for doing this though cause if you looked in the beginning at the interview with the uniformed officer he had a black stripe around his badge which means someone on the San Diego police force had recently died.
My dad is swat I get to go with him
you should try being one of the actors for a video
The SWAT in this video: Special Weapons and Tactics SWAT at my school: Super Wonderful and Talented Me: well the 2nd one must be a 2nd way to say SWAT because they are all super wonderful and talented-
I love the longer videos that give you more of a chance to show us your thoughts on the matter. It seemed like you would've had more comments at the end of the video about your experience as a whole! I think it'd be super interesting to hear more of your reflections on it after it all after you've digested it a little more.
Genuine question—I noticed that at no point during the exercises did you tell the perpetrators to drop their weapons. Was it mentioned that this would be a useless endeavor and would endanger hostages/escalate the situation, or is it something you simply don't do because at that point it's known the situation is too past that point? Or did they just not include it in these training scenarios because they were, in fact, training scenarios?
Iolllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllolllllllllllllllllll,l
My nephews had the swat team come to their house and they pointed their guns at innocent kids…the guy they were searching for wasn’t even their and they made one of the kids leave the house naked which in my opinion was a violation to the kids..
Idk why, that looks fun
Thank you for your sharing,it's a good way to let us know about S.W.A.T.again❤
good job girl !
*Shows Breaching and Rapelling Me who plays Rainbow Six Siege: "I've been an expert in this my entire life😎"
The fact that I wear a army backpack to school is HILARIOUS LMAO I could probably be a backpack holder the only problem is that my asthma could never pass💀
You should record the segments like this 13:10 with a body cam or helmet cam. That'd be pretty cool to see.
could you try horse riding?
"My beautiful illistration of a room" im rolling 🤣
it's nice to see in women in these videos. it's reassuring and comforting for me as a viewer to believe that the presence of women also comfort michelle. not only that but it shows that women can do these things too
is this real guns
you try so hard for your videos so thank you
hearing the stories I personally thing India is much safer than other countries
That was intense! Awesome video! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time
Cool, cool.So, what are these Heroic Heroes of Heroedom gonna do when Kids get shot? I'm sure these most heroic badasses of herodom will excel.  Frankly, fuck these People.They are not Soldiers.Nor are they in the same Danger. They are murderous cosplayers, armed to the teeth.
You should do a video on you getting on a 400 ft rollercoaster!
"The biggest rule as far as breaching, is always check the doorknob. It's always gonna be faster to open up the door"... If only the police in Uvalde, Texas, had seen this video.
You're too beautiful
Started with one video. Now I can't stop binge watching What drug do you put in this videos, they're so addictive
Military academy!!
Best granny ever so many stories
1:19 WTF IS SHE ALLOWED TO TOUCH THE GROUND?? YOU'D GET THE HELL SMOKED OUT OF YOU!
Can you try being a riot officer
How about military academy
I here after the rob elementary school shooting. On the news I heard that the police didn’t enter until the swat got there. I can’t tell it’s it real or not
Try to be one of the CIA Agents since u did FBI, Army / military or others
Kudos to Michelle for having proper trigger discipline.
I have a challange for you: life as an equestrian at a training stable, learning and doing stuff all around the horse. Work a day or two as a stable hand or something and ofcourse riding with a 'competition' at the end.
Suspect: DON’T COME IN Michelle: Good Morning ☀️ *bombs door*
I enjoyed the video - thank you and your team Michelle. Great job. I do though, invite anyone to try the South African Police TASK FORCE training. I doubt whether even the American Rangers/Marines/ or SEALS, will pass this training...
martial arts competitions. Including training.
Militarization of the Police is a great way to get around the constitution.
i've done rappelling at 60 feet and i think i know what you felt like
Would love to see a retry challenge where are you try to complete any of the qualifications that you might’ve failed a part  over the years like the pull ups I think it be really cool to like see you see how much you improved over the years and also train for things that you may not have been able to do the time
noob always be noob
Always check door knob, I remember my first entry pulled on the knob and it did not move.  Kicked in the door but later learned it was a push to open.  Really broke the door frame.
I like this 10/10
4.26.  She look like the rose skin from warzone
Navy seal? Kinda feel like that might be fake because u can’t just do that, if u go through the training and make it you are now a SEAL, so she would not be here they would have sent her to the Middle East
Hand down had me cracking up🤣🤣
Its funny how he tried to explain the misconception people have about SWAT  😂 ''We are gonna jump out of our truck, run right up to the door, and kick it in and go full tactical''
Funny part---You can tell who is Law Enforcement at the Gym - I got rid of all my weapons when I finally realized civilization is doomed
love youre videos
Dam good training. She’s so hot I start sweating every time I press play.
Ok she looks like a badass in the stack holding an SBR 💪🏼
Her jokes are incredibly horrible 😂
From CALIFORNIA
Strong girl! And love the content
it’s weird i randomly watch these and then forget about you for a a couple months.
Now I learned how to pass a wall 👁🫦👁
Where's the 911 dispatcher ???
The swat members are so nice :)
You just so damn pretty!!!
How does bro qualify for the FBI and not SWAT 🤠
Tell ya what, that was amazing. New sub right here
Why were there SRT personal there SRT is not SWAT they are a part of MP
As a person that plays A LOT OF VR SHOOTER GAMES, this seems really easy to do, it seems fun too
You should try to practise like a professional soccer/football player.
bro in your country is relly easy in my country you have to do 60 posh up in 2 min, 60 situps in 3 min sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
bro she got 3,666,999 views
hAnDs Up pAnTS dOWn
Swat be like FBI OPEN UP
so this is basically how to kill campers.
That girl maked every special forces trainings
Lol you're funny, alright you get a sub
I love how you always relate to movies!!
Ppl are really trying get on the force to save lives but you guys take it for a joke smh
I'm so excited to join the United States of police But unfortunately really I don't know how I can join then . because I live outside of United States. Someone could help me to join them ?
You were at the top of my recomended, Nice to meet you
Your videos are so awesome takes a lot of courage to do what ur doing
Intersting, those people do such a demanding job, thank you for the insight.
Just wanted to let you know there’s a commercial prior to your video was a pro abortion commercial
the push ups. you didnt do them right
In an interview. Person: So how much jobs have you had in the past? Michelle: y e s.
call of duty but in real life:
Instructor showed you wrong on the manual breach with the ram. You would break your wrist doing it the way you did.
I really wanna be apart of the swat but I'm only 12
Your one of my fav job YouTubers
No one’s faster than the cameraman
LOL
Sorry but a fun little obstacle course should not be a requirement for a job about handling dangerous situations. I thought this was about swat not wipeout😂.
This looks so fun
for me the 6 pull ups are easier than 20 pushups
Great job!
I tell you I play call of duty and it is very hard
i realy want to be in the special force
what type of guns are u using?? like it cant be real guns and it doesnt feel like airsoft so what is it?
Can you please go train as truck driver and share the obstacles of it
Of course, the physical fitness standards are lower for women 😏
I love all of like the cartoon comparisons she makes to all of the things. It makes me smile.
I rlly would love to see you attempt trampolining it can be a challenging sport but it’s beautiful and the way you feel when h get a new skill is amazing I would love to see that love u heaps💕🌸💖
The flash bangs gave me CS:GO flashbacks.
bruh she really compared being a SWAT to COD irl lmao
You should try navy bootcamp my older brother did that
I dare you to play cod
Just imagine she break down the door at starbuck and say this " i need my extra crunchy Frappuccino like now" (I'm just guesting)
I used to hate your content now im sorta enjoying it ima sub to you
when her doorknot turn's into a minigun
Cameraman be like:I gut a gun a video gun 😎😎😎
Swats are great, I like how they catch the serial killers.
Is really hard to be Swat like in moments with peopel having pistol or auto Guns and You are a swat You need shoot and get cover and run like a raid. I love the video
New subscriber oh my God I love what you're doing you are so lucky to experiencing these type of things I'm in love myself so anything that has to do with SWAT dispatch any of that I love and definitely want to move up in my career this is really cool to see so thank you so much you're awesome
Not only did Michelle enjoy it, but you can tell the instructors thoroughly enjoyed the teaching. Shoutout to those guys. Respect.
I will become swat member......... :/ my parents are not happy with that idea but idc :P
Just found your channel now I’m binge watching everything! Keep up the amazing content it’s really eye opening and makes me more appreciative of all the hard work these people do to keep the community safe
this is cool
You are incredibly brave I would not be able to go through anything in your videos love you and we will always support you!! <33
Even tho he already shot someone?   Very solid question
Could you maybe try air force or navy pilot training
can you not just kick the door?
Omg Michelle is a gem that stays giving
Once I had a sniper pointing at me well two but I think the second one was a professional two different location
I want try every thing
At least she tried
Only in America can you go to a Major League football game in a multi billion dollar arena with a SWAT team protecting you from the outside 😭😂
A sniper
its really tents being a swat because like you bust down doors and scout out the area and all that other swat things
Michelle is comedian 😂
she might want to stop the cackling and giggling, this is really SERIOUS shit !!
My dream
1:54 😳😳😳😳
I was on campus during the Santa Monica College shooting-- I saw SWAT officers (from what I remember) positioned there pointing guns at us students and helicopters in the air, just like in the last scenario. It was both relieving and terrifying, but I'm lucky such skilled people were there
A beautiful women Michelle!!!
damn!!! you look so sick in full gear girl.
Camera man is insane
Honestly more people would volunteer for swqt if they let you keep these extremely cool swat suit and vest
Very nice academy.
20:02 she really drop my man like that. bro just go "ah my leg" lol. In all seriousness in military or police women can not carry men most of the time unless if they lift heavy weight.
In my county  if you are a poison peddler, you will have a nice wake up call with flash bangs and our Swat Team will Blow your front door right off the hinges. if you do Drugs our Swat Team will Come for you Next and we are going to keep coming back until the county does something about it
OH MAN IN THIS VIDEO I JUST LOVE THAT DOG AND SNIPER  AND THE SWAT GIRLS DAMNNNNNNNNNN
her before the flash bang :))))))) her after the flash bang :(
Michelle,s face before going down tourer is halaryis 😗😗😗😗🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dude you’re a woman just saying a man will always be better than you
I love your films Michelle
I am going to be a s▪︎w▪︎t
This girl is so cute & pretty.
man how does swat grab there damn M4 rifle everyday with there helmet and vest dont they sweat lol
man i would be hyped and would be super mad at the someone doing something bad
FBI OPEN UP!!!
Love from Morocco!
Marine boot camp is harder than swat academy at least swat is kind but marine is the oposite
You should try doing k9 unit
if getting out of your comfort zone was a person  BTW who makes movies and puts them on YouTube 😅🥰 extremely calitative videos 🤩
Amazing you've tried deffirent activities. So nice.
How dare she drag Mokujin. 😏
The fact she describes the person who pushes the explosin button as coyote
Funny how she does a little hop before she jumps
how about the British Special Air Services?????? pleaseeeee
Interesting video!
*Thank you Men*
Michelle you should try paratroopers
Very cool.
A good show that I feel like shows this all well too is Flashpoint, their team isn’t called swat- they are strategic response unit or SRU because they are in Canada. Good show though.
Lo go!🇺🇸
"Hands Down"
Dharr man?
Being 11B(infantrymen), a little disappointed that we dont have cool looking m4's. At least here at Bragg..
so fine
I always admire these SWAT faces in TV shows - always so well-groomed and with good make up on! )
bro this is in san diego
14:54 Hey hands down! Hands up! lol
That looks fun
after paintball now this? you are gaining my interest on some of your contents. BTW lets go michelleeeeeeeeeee
In my home town!!!
OMG you're so cute
Hello from United Kingdom. I love your videos. I’m a big fan of you! Keep it up😊
When "training" for something as stressful as SWAT stuff , try to be a little more serious instead of being a girly girl with the jokes . I'm sure the female officers watching had a good laugh .
Amazing video!
I HAD THE WEIRDEST DREAM EVER
👍👍👍
WAY TO ENCOURAGEMENT FOR THE REAL DEAL WOMEN  THETE OUT THERE THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO FORDITUDE
In my contry we dont say SWATwe say "GDBOP"
This is such a cool video! You are super tough and committed to education! Love these vids
beauty
climbing through the opening above was bad ass. Hadn't seen that obstacle before
Omg lol
I learned about you from your interview with Colin and Samir. WOW! What a great video. I subscribed and look forward to your upcoming video with the Secret Service. :)
Waitaminit - no disclaimer that the video might be triggering to some viewers and no conclusion stating you guess not all cops are bad? I guess the selective outrage-a-thon is over then.
Definitely want to do this outside of Marine corps
Was is Actual bullets though
This has been my dream job!
Initially, it felt like you breached in like Russians do but noiceee
Can you imagine a criminal having a gun in a swat academy
Try air force
if she'd be an officer, she's a jack of all trades.
Damn that physical test was tuff 😭
Cool
I think the best part about watching these is the trust that the interviewees have for Michelle. That's how much she's proven herself on this channel. They know that she genuinely wants to show what they do in a positive light. I also have a lot of respect for Michelle as a journalist and for the people she interviews.
I remember a few years ago having a parade I went to and all the tall buildings there was swat members in the roofs and helicopters and just a bunch of swat members everywhere making sure nothing happen and that was before the huge massacre it was very scary just thinking about that as kids and so many people were in the parade and if something happened
Nice
Nice
how long is preparing Michelle or is it more a spontaneous thing? no matter what impressive
luv nods with lights on
FBI academy
The person I respect most is General Yi Sun-Sin
bro the flash bang like it hurt my eyes
I LOVE YOUR CHALLENGES!!! How was that one different to Cops training, FBI Academy and military training?
4:50
Michelle always cracks me up lol
Same fucking trash bullshit as before
i would love to see you try border patrol i thought you wouldve already done it but ig not
i love your vids Michelle
This made me realize how little recognition and express our appreciation to women in SWAT. Wow I was in awe !
For being a SWAT team they seem really charming, calm, and non violent... I like that.
All this is happening now in real life in the war in Ukraine against nazi russia. It takes a lot of modern weapons to stop putin's mercenaries.
Very nice training facility, if you pause 12:21 you can see on other side of tower they can sim rappelling down from a chopper.
I dare you to try and do the training for a temple guard
Didn't pass fitness test then gets told "that was impressive, good job"
Alright, now try ranger school.
Dude, that obstacle course seems pretty easy.
U are so cool
Lol. PC at its Worst...
You know what we need next? San Diego Sheriffs Academy training
From 18 to 22 is Classified. Leave a perfectly working Aircraft with just Balls, Weapon and a Triage Kit.
Would these guys go into an elementary school to save kids?
I love SDPD
my aunt was at that concert and that was the scariest thing ever. It led to my mom working with her cousin from Hawai'i to do the letters of love and she went with her cousin to las vegas to do the lei of aloha.
14:10 this " Allright" sounds like...  "id like to f*ck you"
☺
should definitely try fencing sabre
He’s standing infront of a window before breaching a room big no no. Train how you fight
You should train like an arm wrestler for a week
You done a good job Michelle 👍🏻
I literally can't wait for your next video
Is she muslim
A lot of hate in the comments I guarantee 90% of y'all no 99% of y'all sit on a f****** couch and comment all day while people like us go out and do things come on now life is too short
Where was this when uvalde had to go through that terrible situation
Love this video!!!.. the part she said hands down🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
She’s a lil squirrel 🐿
Next : FBI
I cant do 1 push-up, no pull ups and barely sprint 100m....  F
For your size it was much harder for you than someone that is 6 ft,you did extremely well and should be very proud.To top that off, you looked much nicer doing it, well done,I really miss my military days and living in the beautiful SD, u can have the cost of living though..
Hey Michelle I love your videos. Can you pls do a day as a principal/teacher during a school shooting?
We will wait for the Turkish Police Special Operations.They have better training than Swat, you can be sure of that.If necessary, they can go out to the Taurus Mountains and perform operations or they can do this all over Turkey.But we have a saying:Calm down and trust the plan.It's not a joke, it's a joke: it spoils us!!!
Bruh😐
you are a legend
do you still play fortnite?
in this week if swat academy well be breaching doors and your moms as- I mean doors
I noticed how the instructor instinctively took a step back when Michelle swung her rifle around. Have to be aware of where the barrel is pointing at all times, even during training.
copaganda as fuck
Repent to Jesus Christ  “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.” ‭‭2 Timothy‬ ‭3:16-17‬ ‭NIV‬‬ J
ngl that obstacle course look easy as shit lmao
Before I watch this video I bet you she cries I comment this in every video
The shooting in Las Vegas hotel I was in the Mandalay Bay hotel but I was 1 year ago I want but the shooting was couple years ago
How many hoops did you jump through to get into this? Even to get the Chief of SDPD in your video
To be S.W.A.T. you need to be a cop for more than 2 years... fake
She gets hotter and hotter in every video science explain
strong girls always try tough or difficult challenges
nice
Wow 😀
this is probably one of the cringiest things I've seen
next sas
When I grow up I want to be  swat
What I like is that she tries again and again and again on hard tasks. Many thanks for the insight!
I would love for you to try professional storm chasing. That would be a fun video to see and for you to experience.
Michelle do you have your own show?
Can you try navy academy?
@ 8:55 yup "try before you pry"
Beautiful illustration of a room 😂😂
i was cracking up when they said check to see if the door unlocked then the slide show of the SWAT team crashing through doors. Lmao media be so dramatic
This is real life Call of Duty, I so agree with you. Task Force 141 is real! Gosh, I'm watching your content back to back!
Why do you have an airsoft mesh mask
It would ne very immersing not breaking down a door that Is unlocked
couldn't go wrong could it
army will be calling come wartime
Did you enjoy the swat academy more or FBI academy more?
You should train as a wrestler! Not a WWE wrestler but a folkstyle wrestler or another style in wrestling. Where there are rules, points, timings, and HARD work at every practice and on the mat in a real match! I would love to see it and I feel like it would bring more respect to wrestlers that started training as children to college wrestlers now. There are many people that judge wrestlers as "gay" as if it's a bad thing because they engage in full contact with the same or opposite sex. I feel like you should also bring awareness from the kids that start from a young age to middle school especially the girls that put so much training into their own success just to have a guy try to get in their headspace and say negative things which is illegal but isn't usually noticed. Another thing that is unnoticed is when people sexually harass others on the mat. In my experience in two years starting in 7th grade I've been sexually harassed in certain moves and nothing being done about it because most ref's, coaches, and judges just believe they need to for a specific move. But I knew the truth and could obviously tell it was intentional. With that happening in my first year and my 3rd match as a wrestler it has changed me but no one took me seriously. I'm still wrestling but not letting what has happened control me and take me from my dream of being a folkstyle wrestler. But beside of me I think you should definitely try it with honest people and I think you'd learn a lot on and off the mat. I will be blown away if you may have actually read this and take it in consideration! Have a blessed day, I LOVE your videos and you have great energy and are so caring for everything you do.
You should do a challenge video on training like a fighter pilot like in TopGun!  I know you did a video on NASA but I think you should do one focused on naval aviators!
Police academy is very strict. You can't miss a day in school, (I don't). But I've heard it's very tough
You gotta do air force
say "challenge accepted" but in barneys voice
She should try Boarder Patrol academy training, apparently it's super hard
play the video game Ready Or Not
All that training and equipment but still managed to let dozens of children die
hahaahh woman
You’re incredible.
I feel as if she went through Navy SEAL training she should be able to already know most of this
I will love to see you try a DEA agent training
Michelle is probably gonna be the fastest and most strongest after all these trainings LOL keep up the great work
Max and minimum are wrong placed
17:13 I choked on that scene twice, her no, I cant😭✋
Next challenge goto Bermuda triangle 🔺️
How are you allowed to record this
Uh look like an indian
How come she is welcomed everywhere? In India they won't even give the form to fill for like  30 min.
quarter mile in under 85s...im winded just hearing all those qualifiers
when you climbed through the second window, you obviously had training before this
Haha the pullups really get us. I exercise and can do 10 pullups.(the last one hurts).
I guess I should have tried to watch this before Uvalde happened. It's hard to believe that they had this training when they failed so bad.
KNEE PUSH UPS ????
The way she yelled hands down😭❤️ Love you Michelle
Ok, real talk. I want to see this crazy amazing woman try to March with a top drum corps. That takes both athletics and endurance, almost as much as top athletes, Indiana University even did a study on it
8:16 AYO IS THAT A PLANE?!
Him: This is a door knocker, weighs about 32 pounds. Her: Ooh, that's so heavy. Him: Holds it with one hand like it's his water bottle.
I bet that dog was just busting to get in there! Fantastic video,and well done,you! The instructors are likely still talking about you,and how well you got through the course.
i have a great idea for your next "challenge accepted". i dont know if you liked the movies or anything but learn to be a jedi. and at the end perform a fight with someone if possible. that would be awesome
Do special forces
pls get magnus mitbo to teach you how to climb and train like a climber, it will be so cool!!!!
It's my first time to watch, but I already love it,
5:55 is impressive
You should train to be a surgeon
Ttvvtvvvtvtttvvvvtvvvvvtvvvv
May i just say that if i had this when i was young it would've been such a good help in defining my actual future... literally, the fact that my kids are going to have these to watch and maybe get a sense of what they'd like to do in the future makes me so happy! continue what you do because, even if sometimes it doesn't seem that way, it matters to so many young kids. even adults if they don't feel like they are doing something they love. I've been a fan since this all started and im still obsessed. Thank you
Try kalaripayatu martial arts its the first martial arts in the world its from india.challenge❤
You should definitely try to train like a equestrian, since there are so many people that misunderstands how hard work equestrians really trains
This is similar to how us firefighters train, we rarely run big structure fires yet we train on worst case all the time. The majority of what we do is slower pace and thinking through things but we always keep working on our worst case call skills.
You should do police K-9 unit training
Train like a kpop idol?
Maybe you could train like a bodyguard next
right leg right leg then slaps it
u go girl
We are all proud of you!
An idea if u want to take less physical stress get a fit challenger and get them to recap what u did as a way become a  host
Her struggling and dieing that one girl: COME ON GO
Try Electric Car.
New viewer here, I absolutely love the little cut-ins like "that's so cool!" "it's like on TV..." lol Also mad respect to the SWAT officers that do this 24/7 and are prepared to have to put these skills to the test. Thanks to the SDPD for agreeing to this collab!
This seems so fun!   I’ve always wanted to be in law enforcement
I like your channel and your challenge accepted safe very informative and interesting. Also for one of your future challenge accepted videos I’d consider trying a bomb disposal technician or EOD tech. Those men and women have a vital role to the safety of both service members and civilians. Also they work for nearly every branch of the military to the FBI, SWAT, local police departments, mad even the Fire department. So that might be something worth considering if you are out of ideas for challenge accepted videos.
Hello this was a amazing video I loved it 😀😀😀 plzz continue this 🥰🥰🥰 I love your videos soooooo much. It makes me too go on to achieve my goal which is to be a police officer ☺️ 🤭 I am 13 years old btw. U make my day much better     🥰 thx 🤭🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Loved this video you should try being a goalie in hockey. Lots of people say its just so easy and anybody an do it but nobody really can know the truth unless they are one. That would be a really cool video seeing you try and stop pucks.
I would love you too see you be a cheerleader for a week
she dont have the "swat personality" xD
You're a badass Michelle <3
Swat demand sweat and time and effort and hardwork. What you all have just witnessed is just a civilian version of what officially really goes through the process . I am not a swat memeber but am a special force for rapid action and rescue operatives( india) . We are the best in our class . Our job is to secure any hostile situation , get civilians out and minimise casualty until more advanced tactical and other strategic team arrive .  I love to see these type of creators especially being a very brave girl taking These realistic challenge way out of their league to understand what the people protectors go through to become one in the first place .
Hey Michelle I challenge you to come to India and train yourself to be a spy
You should try to be a teacher and teach a couple of different grades to see how difficult teachers have it. So basically a substitute.  Copy and paste if you want her too see it!
You should do newscast reporter next!!! It will be interesting
#challenge---please wear Assamese traditional dress for 24 hours and spend a day with Assamese ritual  Please accept my challenge my lovely sister🥰 Love from Assam( India)
i have done 1/4 mile in 1:02 in 8th grade
only 20 pushups ?
do training like a dirt bike rider
Lucky you! Not many get the opportunity to partake in these exercises!
I love when you do challenges and it makes me very happy
At 0:12 it’s that one mission from call of duty
Michelle please break through my window...ok but seriously don't, ill probably be sleeping...I need that sleep lol.
Looks like the police have themselves an r.v.
Trying something in the veterinary field would be really cool to see. This was a great video!
I tried U.S. NAVY BOOT CAMP AND NOW IM A VETERAN 98SEP17. NO  CAMERAS . THE REAL DEAL. MORE REAL THAN YOURE EXPERIENCES

Hey Michelle, could you please try and make a video about the US marshals academy?
YOU SHOULD DO I TRAINED LIKE A KPOP IDOL/KPOP TRAINESS FOR A DAY. kpop idols/kpop trainee go through so much behind doors and nobody thinks about it. A lot of kpop trainess have quit due to the stress, emotional and mental damage, and the disrespect they go through. i would be so inspired by you if you could take the time to do this. thank you michelle you already inspire me and so many everyday.
I love to see you try pit stop crew. I think it would be interesting.
I triple dog dare you to be a judge
did yall notice how beautiful was that female SWAT member that she hugged at the end of the video
Military that is gona be fun >:)
Michelle you look like maya Khalifa
Dude.. you do really well with these challenges. 👍
I watched a few of these videos! I think its very commendable to try these things out with no experience.  I'm glad you are able to pit yourself through that
💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽 GREAT. In Age of 54 I would try it.
Hi Michel! I was thinking about maybe trying horse riding and I have lots of passion for horses so I think it would be nice for you!😊
I feel like if she were to join any armed force, ( eg. army, police, paramilitary etc. ) she'd be perfectly qualified.
Can you learn to drift?
Very cool
"swat open up"
i dare u to run away with Mr. Beast with 99k and ur runing away bye the navey and the f b i! good luck
Hi Michelle! 👋🏻 . As a big fan of your videos I would like to see you try gymnastics 🙂. This is of course if you don’t mind, just something I would like to see you try :) . And remember… you are such an inspiration to all of us and I personally think you are amazing 🤩 xx
You should train like a professional tennis player then play a tennis match
Ngl the guy who was teaching michelle looks like a bald ryan renolds
They got that from LAPD because they came up with it first
Just what part of SWAT are they trained to WAIT. WHILE BABIES ARE BEING KILLED! In Texas!!
Wow..so great 🔥🔥🔥👹
It’s so good I need to watch it again and you should try flight school
h-how?
her in 2027: I Tried a government job *(please dont take this as an offence)*
Pls make a video on living in india
At 9:43 just gets gunned down
I could never do this Michelle- This is such an achievement
Wow that training is superb. I hope we have that here in the Philippines....
S.W.A.T Sit Wait and Talk
dont know why but your videos are interesting and keeps me watching nice work
When I grow up I'm going to be a swat!
challange: jump out of a plane 8 miles above the sea without a parachute
You should do naval aviation
pogU
Michelle! You should train to play guitar! I think it would be so interesting to watch!
The attitude through this is so inspiring. Of course the physical challenges are incredible but the way Michelle manages to keep a light atmosphere throughout is incredible. You can see how the professionals get into it too
did anyone else notice this mistake at 1:08 ? maximum & minimum are mixed up LOL great video btw
Omg you are like barbie
Hats off to SWAT officers, this job is insane!! To have the mental, physical and tactical skills for this is beyond my comprehension, and to put their lives on the line for it... 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
I thought SWAT stood for Special Weapons Assault Team.
You should try being a Dallas cowboys cheerleader! Americas sweet hearts ♥️
Do US MARSHAL SERVICE
Try interracial pornography with a BBC
Awesome video. Saw you on Colin & Samir and had to checkout your vids.
Girl you're a legend!
Dat a girl ! 👍
This woman gonna be the strongest person in the world 💀
How about military training or smth?
For God so loved the world that He gave His one & only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, But to save the world through Him. (John 3:16-17)✝️
this is supercool
You and your production team's effort and execution are top of the class. I only wish the ending was more conclusive instead of just "I'm exhausted". But I'm honestly just glad I've been reintroduced to your channel thanks to Colin and Samir. You're truly the most badass human on YT.
5 Star. Anything about SWAT always be one of most secret , even more secret than Secret Service and CIA in the past. It's hardly get information about how they training. SEALS and SAS of course brutal and violent in their own way, but SWAT is elite police dealing with domestic matter, quite a lot of unique scenario.
Hey Michelle please go in animal doctor academy
Colin & Samir brought me here
I wanna be a CJ: strong, defeat police,swat and military,buy car, highjack pilot and attack construction workers 😂.
I can see her becoming an officer one day. She's got motivation.
Baseball
Do baseball
Baseball
Baseball
Baseball
Baseball!
You should try learning and mastering a music instrument in week or something like that
Next do a Sniper Academy or something like that please.
im tellin you the camera man's the fastest
Your are so beautiful 😻😍🥰🥰😘😘😘😘😘😘
when will she go to a academy for body guards
next time maybe after the secret service (if they accept) can you do school bus training I've always wanted to know what it feels like cause I'm very interested in them so. maybe you can tell us how it feels. (also I love your challenge accepted videos they are awesome! keep it up!)
They’re so nice to her during training her in the real world they’re mean during training
What if you train for the CIA
maybe in the next vidor you are going to learn a lanaguge..
Hey, Michelle…have you seen the new Purdue University commercial that rips off your tag line? The woman asks rhetorical question into the camera and then looks into the lens and says “Challenge Accepted’. Basically the same as your opening.  That’s it-you’ve made it. You’re becoming part of mainstream pop culture, it seems.
Amazing, I just discovered your channel with the 911 Dispatch video and this one. VERY NICE !!
Oh ya big big fan
I bet you can not handle my challenge the challenge is become a horseback rider professional!
I challenge you to train like an mma fighter
Something I love about this series is how it sheds a light on how hard these jobs are, and how much physical and mental training goes into producing members of services we take for granted. SWAT isn't all about going in guns blazing and shooting anything in sight, even the sniper when the suspect wasn't actively posing a threat waited to see if he would surrender rather than taking life unnecessarily. Thank you so much to these officers and all of our police forces!
no offense but those pushups didnt look like pushups. perhaps its simply cuz of tiredness tho goodjob nonethless
https://youtube.com/shorts/Dg4LwactFgg?feature=share
I'd ask if you wanted to try my job as an Autopsy Technician but that's not exactly Youtube friendly lmao
Two suggestions:    * Helicopter survival/egress training    * some sort of partner acrobatics challenge
LATAM: que mala suerte de no tener más academias pero unidos las fuerzas militares seran mejor que una potencia
It would be cool if you did an episode of Challenge Accepted on Penetration Testing! I think this would influence females to go into cyber security!
You remind me of Mia Khalifa
taff lady... looking forward for moire videos like this. definitly a like
Yoo this is my dream you know🔥
Next video: I tried drug maker training with the cartels of Colombia
And women have to do less than men.. Man and I have asthma and am really weak. Not looking forward to police academy. 😕
👏👏👏
When she says that’s the one you see on tv shows you can see a bit of him die inside lol
Dang!! thats cool :O
from the moment i started the video i already knew i was finna subscribe
i gave u a challenge: try or learn hindi  lanvage
as a infantry man there room clearly tactics are slightly different from the army's style of room clearing so interesting

U should try being a bounty hunter with Patty Mayo
Try the military
Do swiming with sharks!!

You are  funny
i feel bad for the guy who get shoot in the leg i hope he is ok
try the life on an aircraft carrier if it's possible it could be awesome! really good content keep up the good work!
My idea is to prone and then open the door and then look to everything
Well I just learned something new. I never knew snipers watched over big events like sporting events. Actually makes me feel a bit safer.
my friend had his front door busted down by swat for a drug bust, wrong house, they had to replace the door
Try to be an Oral Surgeon Assistant for a day!
Michelle you did a pretty good job! Big Respect!
I challenge you to try getting an open diver certification. (scuba diving)
I was wondering if you could do a veterinarian
🤌🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽😉😉😉
I know that I should be commenting on how fun this looks but I just love her laugh 😂 it always makes me smile!
WOW.A S.W.A.T
She could Brazilian jiu jitsu and train for naga or grapplers quest try a competition
Damn.. that obstacle course is no joke.. I'm impressed and were not even 5 minutes in.
Michelle Khare your life is so exciting because you do challenging thing all the time.
0:35 I'm sorry but this sounds like my elementary fitness test lol. I mean its a little different, like the pull ups we had to do one or two, but I could do 10 😅 (still can btw)

When i saw the sniper enter the scene, i just heard boss music by the way he was walking
Haha i can't stop laughing when the camera man looks like holding a gun ahahaha
At 14:54 did she really say hands down to the suspect🤣🤣
If she has a kid at locks her out she can now breach it😂
Instead of boot camp do Navy seal hell week
She is exactly why women aren't generally allowed in combat roles. Most don't have the strength or stamina and don't take things seriously. There are women that are real badasses out there that can do it but not many. She references "playing Call of Duty" but she wasn't even doing that. SWAT isn't military. Military deals with situations far larger and more dangerous then SWAT. Instead of just one shooter there are hundreds.
Basketball next please
I think for the next challenge you should train like a professional swimmer for a week 😍🏊  PS love your channel 😍 A lot of love from Serbia ❤️❤️❤️
For the next challenge accepted you should train like a hockey goalie
HANDS DOWN HANDS DOWN
I don’t really the fact that she was the only girl there

Ok so I used to watch her videos about 2 to 3 years ago and I was caught up with school but I decided I would balance everything and I did. I'm now back to watching like all her videos and they are still amazing and way better than I imagined. She has really grown and it's amazing to see where she started and what she is able to do now!
i know this is alot to ask for and you cant always do what we would like you to do but i would love to see a video where you train like a professional batminton player as someone whos dedicated alot of time and hard work into this sport i would love to see someone else try learning it no although i am still young i do play for team where i live and im really good at it so i would love to see you do it but as always its totally 100% up to you :)
You should do: i trained like a k-pop idol
Hey Michelle, I challenge you to race a FPV drone!!!  An average person, with extra hard work, after 6 months of training, should be able to finish a track in under 3 minutes. A top pilot could finish the same track in under 30 seconds. Extremely complicated hobby with multiple fields of knowledge required.
* breaches door * knock knock! :D goodmorning! :D   I'm dying😂
As someone who identifies as a F-86F-30 Air Superiority Jet Attack Fighter i wanted to thank you for representing Mig-15Bis jet Attack Fighter Inceptor Coomunity

Someone with agoraphobia here knowing the swat is there at events makes me consider going lol
I swear every time I feel like you’re on the height of your emotions or physicality I’m cheering for you! You’re a badass time and time again Michelle! 🤍

Her back must’ve hurt for a week after jumping through the window and flying backwards to the wooden nailed wall
Is that the guns heavy?
You are a hero, Mrs Michelle.
She thinks she’s so cool

Do the beast master
Khare do you do the academys so when you want to join its already done ???
I've bin thinking of the meme the whole time
Michelle Khare can you try professional painting next or at least something involving art? Suggestions: street artist, digital artist, painter, spray painter, etc
18:20 how does she know the police code? That was sick!!! Michelle Khare please do another challenge which is to be an police officer for one day and actually respond to real life threats! NEW CHALLENGE ACCEPTED?!?!?

I loved that video it was great.but intense
17:53 call of duty is now here bois
NFL Combine next
Love it!!!💯💯💯👏🏼
You should try ballroom!!
As an equestrian, it would be great to see you try horse riding! Horse riders have to be strong, courageous, and a little crazy. You’re all of the above!I really do think you’d enjoy it though😁
I am SUBSCRIBED for about three years   :)
I have lived in San Diego for 12 years now!
i love your videos i want to do stuff like you i look up to you your so strong keep doing your videos
it reminds me of cadet kelly
Wow so inspiring!! Just genuinely curious, did you ever get your back flip?
this was sick
*BANG* “down on the ground ... down on the ground” *BANG*
16:07 call of duty is more of kill everyone you see swat scenarios are in games like rainbow six siege
this was amazing
That second MOUT instructor was a colossal douche. People like him are over confident in themselves and forget the team in practical application
When I went through a similar course, the guy ahead of me, Pat The Truck we called him, picked the dummy up and put it on his shoulder. Needless to say, I had to drag it. Never seen it since that day, even the instructors were surprised. Even when I was Infantry School, I never saw anything like that. Also, breaching an unlocked door is extremely embarrassing lol
Thats dangerous if doing a real mission
10:10
Hey you should try to be a professional mermaid for a week
Michelle you know right theres more men in the s.w.a.t academy
Shesh
This woman is amazing and a badass
You should do Airsoft

She's better than me but the excuse is that I'm 14 :-}

Do you regret trying out the swat academy? or was it fun?
She could qualify for so many different careers from all the training she has gone through with her challenge accepted videos
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Ive Got A Great Idea For You! See What It Takes To Become A GIA Bench Jeweler! Make A Goal To Make A Ring?
Hiii! I know this isn’t something really big like the SWAT but i would love to see flight attendant academy! I think it would be very interesting!
You should try Marine Corps sniper school
One thing that I always wondered is if first entry has had an fixed position or if the person can choose right or left?
you should make a video on trying to be a hitman                 jk maybe learn to box or something
you should try being a costoms officer

Dude you were a earmuff hahahahaha and i love my dad soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much
you have earned yourself a sub lol
U should do firefighter academy
"That was impressive, well done." Bad coaching. No motivation when one is praised for failing. Michelle did well, I couldnt have done it better. But theres stuff she needs to improve and work on. It wasnt impressive at all, objectively.
It might be REALLY hard but can you try to be a pilot
I will love to see you try kungfu or takundo
You should realy try skateboarding
The explosive device that was kinda slow mo was it kind of a granade
boring
14:50 "Hey hands down, *oh shit* hands up, hands up"
Watching Michelle’s videos is like watching a documentary
14:37 she looks so silly in that outfit LMAO
14:55    HEY HANDS DOWN
Hey! Do S.A.S Or S.E.A.L
Try hockey
Challenge yourself to do "I trained in the state police governors protection detail"
No offence but it looks like these people are training a child
this girl is gonna try every job in the next 5 years
You should try like pilot school or something.
PLEASE  DONT DO THIS TO YOURSELF ITS NOT WORTH IT
You should try eletrical lineman academy,  that would be cool😎
You can try being a British royale nanny, they have to learn self defence and much more!
this looks so fun when its you're the only one being trained. I would hate doing this with long lines where the quality of feedback normally just drops to the floor. Not actually sure how it works, maybe it is 1 on 1 training.
Try to become a professional house cleaner!
She makes it look so easy
Do a baseball training video
17:54 Since when did we start playing Rainbow 6 in VR 🤣🤣 That area looks just like a map off of Siege
The moment right after you said call of duty in real life hard, it talk about night vision and I remember there was an event where the maps were at night time so you could take off your night vision to charge it because it had a limited amount of battery and you could put it on so you could see better in the dark
Great Video 👍👍👍👍
Love the scene from "die hard"
The SWAT Team is basically a army but for like city’s and major shootings a big killings
10:23 be like FBI OPEN UP

all jokes aside it looks cool, but it's serious and great training. these women and men on the SWAT are the next tier in police response. great Video

Maybe this is out of the ordinary compared to the rest of the videos, but could you maybe try teaching? Lol
Next time can you do the FBI
Hello,  I know this is not the correct support I'm looking for, but bare with me! My instagram account has been hacked since December 2021. I tried all possible methods to get it back ,but none worked! I also tried to contact instagram staff, but there isn't a live chat like this one!   I looked up other ways to contact the owner of Instagram, (Facebook), and it is said if you have a business account, live chat shows up. So I made a live business page to get my account back from support chat, sadly I wasted so much money on advertising but no chat showed up!  The hacker disabled my 2-FA, changed password and put in a new gmail account!   If any of you are part of Facebook teams, or know a friend who is, please, tell he/she I need help retrieving my hacked Instagram account! I have had my account since 2012, but it was hacked in an instant while I was at work!!!!  -Dany A.
9:39 I'd be more scared if it were you, you've done it all FBI, marine corps,NASA, SEALS and that just what I see on the side bar
I am literally on my way back from horse riding and I am crying bc it's hard and ur videos are awsome so could you pls try horse riding
i would watch that movie
That is just like asking my 80 yearold grandad's father to go commit war crimes in Bosnia for the second time.
Did you ever try bomb difusal/removal idk what it is called training. if there is one pls do it and if u did already tell me bout it!
I would love for you to try colorguard! Nobody knows what it is or how difficult it is, and we need the publicity :) and I think it’s a really fun thing to learn. You spin/toss equipment like flags, rifles, and sabres, and you dance while also trying to act through the dance.
if this gets 1 like then I will- FLASHBANG
I would probably pqss out after 24 minutes
the door went boom
Michelle is a Legend, not only is she so mentally strong but is up to try new challenges. Keep going your the best! And your a inspiration!

Jonny sins: FINALLY A WORTHY OPPONENT..

16:20
More gaming please Michelle
FiveM irl 😤
Michelle is a very inspiring person, what I love the most about her is, she posts meaningful content that opens people's eyes to the reality of everyday life around the world, while gaining experience on all the jobs and programs she has attempted! We need to emulate Michelle!
I'm fairly new to your channel so I have no idea if you've already done this- but i thought it would be cool to see you do more...contemporary dancing. Like the type of cheorgraphy you would see in k-pop videos. Be even cooler if you could partner wit a k-pop group to do it as well
not sure how honed or confident you are in your driving skills but learning how to off road, boat, or trucking! I'm a new truck driver and always cheer on other women on the road! thank you for these incredible videos!
Awesome as always! They were really nice to you this time...  So. After all this? What DO you want to be when you grow up? Unless you've decided growing up is boring?
Camera man vs Shotfired
https://youtube.com/shorts/Dg4LwactFgg?feature=share
20 push ups in a minute, the state police special forces selection here in Coahuila México requires 80 push ups in 1 minute, you boys are soft as f**k.
If this is hard, then I think Spetsnaz are just superhumans.
Try Flight Attendant Training!
wow
What she does for a her fans!
hey I wanna ask you something which is can you try airsoft sport?
If I could do another Career, I honestly would of gone into SWAT or similar. I train often with weapons just to protect my family with the horrible world that can sneak and get you. I was robbed at knife point outside of Hobby Lobby (craft store) with my 2 year old on my left hip after turning down a homeless guy 20mins prior inside the store. He said hi in the store and was fine until he moved to talking to my toddler saying "you want to know what I want to do to your Mom?!"... it was dark and 9:50pm and I was walking in a dark parking lot with a very upset 2 year old and a full cart. Luckily I had my daily carry on me (I carry my kids on my left and carry on my back right where I know their hands and feet can't touch when I'm holding them and I'm right handed). I wasn't giving up my belongings, my child or myself. After him saying sexual things in the store, and honestly judging him hard in my head inside the store thinking he had some mental issue, he could of done anything. My daily carry stopped something that could of been horrible as heck. He did get my car keys since I dropped those to grab my weapon
Just subbed (NOT bc im a simp)
you literally can just apply for special agent and get immediately admitted 😂
I think its good to see changes from Mandalay Bay, I have family up in Vegas and used to live there myself. When the shooting happened I actually had family working on one of the lower floor restauraunts of the Mandalay Bay, im just happy to see change. (they werent hurt in the end)
Try ICE academy, that is my challange for you!
You should try performing at a circus 🎪
If you're taking request, airline attendant , zoo keeper.
Can you do soccer player
It's more like rainbow 6 tham call of duty
As a lazy person. I want you to feel what it's like for you're mom to undercook your hot pocket while your in a call of duty warzone match and your team is complete shit
Čiji ono svatovi Bez muzike poljem hode Čiji ono svatovi Uplakani kolo vode Čiji ono svirači Mesto pesme, tugu poje Čiji ono svirači Mesto para, suze broje
Michelle is such a cutie 🥰
how do you make money bc youtube doesn’t pay that much plus wouldn’t you have to pay them for this bc you are working but it’s a tour yk this should be actually free bc they are working for you and they get an experience so it’s a win win really but my question still stands as my long comment rant proves nothing sry for this long comment thank you for taking you time to read i chat a lot even when typing💀😂🍄🧋🤎 btw the random last three emojis are my signature!

Hey I was just watching your paint ball video and I was thinking you should do air soft
you should try flight school and learn to fly a plane
I'm getting Rainbow Six Siege vibes from this
Do a bonty hunter academy
She isn't trained for that kind of situation but she's already doing well
I think it would be really REALLY cool if you trained like a pro Hockey player or gymnast 🤩🥳🤩
I think it would be cool to see Michelle being a mom for a-day. Aka babysitting, it's a pretty hard job!
can you pls be a cook plssss in subscribed.

Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
challenge idea not looking at myself in a mirror for an entire week. I hear it's shocking when you block our your face and the feeling you get when you see it again. A great lesson on self-image and how we judge ourselves so harshly especiall7 when we are face to face with our own face and boduy. Another idea would be I trained at a zoo, I want to see firsthand what it takes to protect the animals and make them feel at home and not imprisoned and how the animals react and how to calm them down in shows like sea world. That would be so cool!!!
you should try joining the circus!
Stranger: So, what do you do for a living? Michelle: EVERYTHING
now do training for the delta force
I wanted to try, but didn't have T&A, to get accepted.
You should train to be a wrestler

Cops have better equipment, but the southern border is wide open and almost 2 million more illegal aliens entered in 2021.    Think that will increase crime or lower it?

4:44 His voice sounded so disappointed when Michelle said "This is the one you see in TV shows"
Idea: -Try out the the pilot academy                        -Try out Air Force Academy
DO A CRIMINAL FORENSICS EPISODE
Michelle you should try horseback riding! Everyone thinks it’s so easy but it’s actually quite difficult. That would be so cool!
I miss your comments throughout the videos on learning and personal growth and challenges and close out comments about what you take from these experiences.

Thank you for making this. I might join the swat team because of this
You should try the us elite forces.
You are so amazing and brave. I just have one suggestion, could you do something that involves skateboarding?
so flashbangs don't have any light and if subject wear ear protection they are kinda useless?
I just put this on for my 8 year old son and he said, "I'VE ALREADY WATCHED IT AND I LOVE IT LET'S WATCH IT AGAIN!"
4 months of training trying to get 10 pull ups just to only get 3 bruhhh 😂

You looked like a real swat member in the swat uniform and gear
you should try a orca trainer at seaworld
Good job, even though you clearly missed the quarter mile run unless you can run 200 meters in 4 seconds
You know the camera work is good when u never even question it.
I love how quickly she picked all that up. Totally badass
all you need to do for doors is just break them down with your foot
You should try out NCIS or DEA or USCG training too if you feel like it!
You should do a I try tornado chasing
This was awesome! Thanks Michelle !
This is amazing and so impressive! Will you see if you could do this again but instead of SWAT astronauts...?
uk
Venha ao Brasil e nos mostre como é o recrutamento para se tornar um policial do BOPE que é a elite da policia do Rio de Janeiro e uma das mais preparadas do mundo.
Im so gay for michelle😂❤
They clearly didn’t teach you the most important thing and that’s to raid twitch streams
Wuhman......  so sick of seeing them try to do this shit
In real life, those pushups would not be counted as a pass.
Iv been watching her videos since the marine boo camp video and I think that was 3 year ago 😂 I love all her videos
In 9:22 she was like FBI OPEN UP!
Thank you for doing these amazing entertaining videos you just gained another sub!

How about mountain/boulder climbing for a challenge ?
Hello Michelle can you please try the training of the Special Action Force or S.A.F for short the are an elite police unit in the Philippines and I would like you put it in a video thank you.
Is it just me or everyone found michelle particularly funny and bubbly in here 😄

INSANEEE love it michelle you and your camara  crew are awesome
i didn't get to do it this cool BUT in criminal justice class back in 9th grade i did get to do something similar and breach a bus our teacher barrowed and we also got taught how to stack and throw the flashbang so if i ever got the chance to take the full real training i would
they got something wrong, the left man should enter the room first, not the right one,
Quarter mile sprint...is 5 seconds shy of my actual quarter mile pace for running my mile and a half lmao. 6 pull ups too..standards a joke
I have a challenge u might wanna acept  training as a professional airsoft player and
Can u do a coast guard  training
sheeesh the camera man really getting some gains

Those guys are for real girl could tell you a lot but not as good as them
Oh wait okay… im actually kind of feeling myself because I can past the minimum at least in a minute… though pulls up… im with you. I can’t do those whatsoever
You should try airsoft
The “hip slinking groovy thing” is the most boomer thing ive ever heard
I LOVE THESE VIDS

“Knock knock!” Omg i laughed but I also cried because of how she did that 😭😭
I love it.,we need more of this videos
Can you do something we’re you go play wheelchair basketball, or do training for wheelchair basketball because I have to do it at school in gym and it is sooo much fun!
I think I’ve got a flash bang to my ears XD
It might be REALLY hard but It would be really cool if you tried to be a pilot!
Yaaaas
I bet you don't have this emoji 😶⃤
Good Job Michelle! This Video was amazing!
@michelle Khare Thats good you tried the SWAT course my dad out of his 40 years in law enforcement he did 15 years as a SWAT officer
Next you could try border Patrol
Imagine being a hostage and when the swat team walks in they start laughing about how to say clear
VERY Good Video....as a 30 year SWAT Instructor (Military and LEO) this was a good overview of SWAT Training!! Back in the day when we put a new rookie on the team his initiation was to hold a balloon between his legs and I ( Sniper 1 team 2) would shoot from 100 yards and burst the balloon..... THAT IS TRUST IN YOUR OVERWATCH..... HOOAH!!  Cheers to us and those like us....DAMN FEW LEFT!!!!!!
Can you try to train like a MLB player next.
can you do a day in the life of a proffesional jockey
We need the air force next should fly some f35s
Michelle: relating everything to tv shows! i love you michelle
This girl could have every job in the world...
everybody thinks that this clowns  SWAT are something special like any special police  unit but they are not!! their biggest advantage is much bigger numbers  because its not like in retard movies or shows (NCIS and similar)  where one SWAT guy goes on 20 bad ones , in reality 20-30 goes on one guy  and that is  "secret" of succes
SWAT is only good and in advantage when 30-50 guys go on one then they are swat
In my opinion the pull-ups were the easiest 😭
can you try Equestrian riding and Try to compete Horse Jumping Competition?
Try k9 trainer
you should really do Virginia navy seal. Virginia is one of the best military states and a lot of police know who you are, and they will be willing to let you come and see what it is like
Be safe Michelle ♥️
Thats so intense
I wish I could do this.. but I’m probably too young
This is so cool
Michelle, the work that you are doing is incredible 😀❤️ wow so many things on this channel 😍
Michelle you have been making awesome videos which quite funny tho but why not you try Forest Department?
I think all these places she goes too and trains for the people who work there feel so happy to have a normal person coming and telling them how cool their work is and how great they are for doing their jobs, I know if I had someone come in an tell me how cool I was doing my job I would feel so happy
Been subscribed watched the video and the bell is on <333
Can some one get Netflix so we can get her a show plsss
The guy: we're going to do the explosives now. Michelle: okay 😄
ITS TRUE! Michelle is Barbie!
This looks so fun
You should try army airborne school
Hands down that’s what she said
The female SWAT operator at 18:00 of the video has a nice smile.
do I Tried lifeguard
Hello Michelle, I’m a big fan and I was wondering when are you gonna try piloting I’m a really big fan of planes! :)
You are amazing, I saw you when you started to do the ones that you train like a superhero now I regret not following but I'm glad that YouTube brought me back to your channel and content keep being awesome. BTW if you need a challenge like less intense but good still try to run a D&D Game as Game Master
No way when we go to the  beach and there's like that  jump jump to go to o water i have phobia of heights
anyone else notice at 4:53 she flagged the instructor, and he almost snapped but remembered not to
This is incredibly cute to watch Michelle more challeng accepted videos
Every time I watch her do the physical tests for these videos I'm so aware of how fit Michelle is. They are so incredibly difficult to pass
Game Warden Academy next?
Amazing episode as usual
She could be the protagonist on a tv show where she's trying to join SWAT 😂 that would be hilarious
Y the heck is the trunk door locked?!!!!!! Wtf!!! Oh wait it's commiefornia!!!  Waste of time to have that rear door locked!
Do US Marshals!!! 😀
It looks easy but it isnt!
Air Force
Excellent video! Very well produced!
I would say she did so well in the scenario, she handled it well even if she stumbled in the helping part
7:03 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I imagine that a small operator probably had its really good benefits for sneaky situations I hope in the future she retakes the test and passes it
I have never felt like a lazier couch potato than while lying on the couch, watching the beginning of this video.  Also, it's really sad that we live in a world where something as forceful as the SWAT is needed. This was intense to watch.
I have alot of respect for you doing these challenges. It takes alot to do all this stuff, especially when you could be doing anything else other then some of the stressful jobs imaginable.   Also thankyou for shining a neutral light on our first responders
It was so funny when you inmanch me comment with this
Another fantastic video Michelle keep it up
"Hands down. Hands up" 💀
Likewise, check your corner. When I was playing "Rainbow Six: Siege," on my PS5 this guy didn't check his corner & he got me killed it was like 2 birds with 1 stone. Idiot. Pls. check your corner. :) Good video!
I love this channel.
Is that bald Ryan Reynolds?
I'm giving you worse challenge be a solder one day
Try judo
Spend at least 3 days with a few friends and take on Wim Hoff himself
try airsoft
I was scared for u and with u well u were repelling
You should learn how to be a pastry chef, similar to when you learned how to be a professional chef.
That was so freaking awesome thank U and God bless U
i wanna do that with a minigun and say heres jhonny
You should do skyscraper next
you should try to train like a prefesional soccer player
For the 20th time, I think you should do border patrol. Not only is it taxing physically but there is a bigger conversation there that needs to be had.
I'm pretty sure that half of the swat team members are ex military, especially those who served in special ops. Overall I can't do this.
Michelle you’re so cool 🤍
As cool and tough Michelle is I sometimes wish she would just be quiet and listen to get information out cause her talking could make her miss an important detail
I have a challenge for you try to be a bounty hunter for a day with Southland bounty hunters Patty Mayo
Michelle's checklist must be very impressive.
I am so glad i found this channel. Not sure how it took me so long lol  I love what she does and how she really puts her all into everything she does
Wow I’m amazed
Epic Video! Would have loved your conclusion, though. :) A little monologue in the end, capturing your emotions...
Wow what an eye opening experience!! You should try coast guard!
🫠
I wish i can try this!
My husband is a breacher
Man the Vegas Shooting was a tough one for us Nevadans. But we came back strong. #VegasStrong
the las vegas part:( i live in vegas. and it still sinks my heart. but GOODJOB ON THIS CHALLENGE MICHELLE!
Ignore the give.
I dont know how she can do this this is insane
I love how after the explosive breaching they just fix the door lol.
Biggest challenge yet, and I believe it can't be done... CIA academy for the Central Intelligence Agency lol.
Michelle, you are absolutely correct about the pull ups because i stoped doing pull-ups for literally 10 days and now i cant do them that much, and you can see that pull-ups are in every training excercise.
Michelle u should try to become a rally co-driver
You're a true legend, Michelle. Thanks for bringing us the untold serious experiences :)
Cool video
You should try drifting!
I bet you could not pass into SOCOM give.
Michelle applying to a job  Job: what’s your job description  Michelle: yes.
Cool
you should do navy seal training if you haven't.
God bless stay safe 🙏✝️
You lucky as hell I dream job is this
"There is no try, only do or do not." _Yoda
That looks Awesome
Hi I'm a new subscriber u should take a breaks I'm afraid ur gonna get hurt pls be careful pls ur my new favorite YouTube
You should try life on an aircraft carrier
Outstanding.
I would love to see her try out a mile or 3200m!
that was awesome
I feel like the edit on this video was a bit weird. It abruptly ended without the usual final summary with professional, where they note what improvements were made in the final scenario. I really like that aspect of these videos but it was completely missing here.
Could you try training like a formula 1 driver
Good job for the swat academy
You should do Flight attendant school and pilot training
I'm a competitive Nordic skier for Nationals and internationals etc. And people tell me how weird it is what we do (we ski up flat and down we train 12 months of the year 6 to 7 days a week 4 to 8 hours a day any time any weather, any downhill skiers mountain we will ski up it and then right back down and people make fun of the sport saying it doesn't deserve anything etc.) But much respect to all the people in this video and behind the camera!
Wie geil weil auch mal
This girl really does it ALL
also I live in a sea side fishing town in the U.k and would love to see you challenge a week as deck hand on a week long trip on a trawler or scalloper please? Thank you
First of all I would like to say I think you're amazing and admire your determination and strength not just physical strength but also your strength of mind and character.  Secondly if you haven't already may I please challenge you (if possible) to learn to pilot a plane? I for 1 would love to see you complete that challenge with the determination you always not only complete every challenge but go as far as to smash it completely out the ball park.
I just can't resist myself from watching your videos every time notification pops up. You're just incredible at everything you take in your hands as a challenge.
cool
the fact that they used real bullets is cool
Hands down for Michelle.
Bro her helmet said R6 she is part of team rainbow
Besides the flagging not terrible for cqb
Pro softball
Love your God so that you may enter Paradise. Believe that Jesus is the Son of God. Ask Jesus to enter your life by praying for the salvation of the soul. Be baptized as a sign of your devotion to Christ. Say the prayer for the salvation of the soul when you are ready to dedicate your life to Christ. Repent of your sins and ask Jesus for forgiveness. Vow to follow Jesus for the rest of your life.
Texas law that allows civil
Sorry, I only drag metric dummies.
Minute 14:46: Hands down, one of the  cooles scene in the video.😉😂
At this point we might as well start claiming Michelle Barbie!
Not gonna lie I want to see her surf
You would be sooo good at dirt bikes!! Or even quad bikes ✨
I'll work with u on stuff like that
💜💜💜
We're no strangers to love You know the rules and so do I (do I) A full commitment's what I'm thinking of You wouldn't get this from any other guy I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling Gotta make you understand Never gonna give you up Never gonna let you down Never gonna run around and desert you Never gonna make you cry Never gonna say goodbye Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you We've known each other for so long Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it) Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on) We know the game and we're gonna play it
omggg this is probably my favourite challenge accepted video so far!! Big props to all swat officers and great video michelle and team!!
pog
Salute to all Men and Women who gave their lives to serve and protect their country and its citizens. Kudos!
Michelle's Cameraman is a GHOST. Totally epic shots in every challenge.
michelle was the suspect really wanted like a real chase?
So fun!
WooHOO
She's particularly abit more jiggle in this episode.
You should do indoor skydiving! It would be super cool to see you doing stunts
Can you train to be a psychologist
Wow nice job
Your the best YouTuber
Can you please train like a Wrestler Or a Utility Worker😉
you got to respect pull-ups and practice them often or they will embarrass you in front of military veterans
could you please do a 'trying to become a professional swimmer' video?
You should try that one thing Steve-o was talking about he attended college for. The clown college . Lol I guess it’s a college where they learn how to make people laugh being a clown and stuff. I’m sure there’s some actual academic educations in that college but I’m curious on what that college might be like lol    Edit: if u end up making a video about it, please put me in it 😂🤣
bro this is fr r6
Whenever you do something athletic like this you should try to make some part of the excercises part of your normal routine so that you can maintain your strength for when you do take on other challenges like this. Like you said if you don’t keep up on it you can lose a lot of strength really quickly. Nice job though well done
Michelle. I have a recommendation for you ! Can you please try Animal Safari academy or experience being a zoo keeper
You rock Michelle! You’re videos are so inspiring!
love you girl. do you boo❤❤❤
Ephesians 5:4 in the Bible: nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking which are out of place, but rather thanksgiving
Can you do a challenge accepted: being a nurse
John 3:3 in the Bible: Jesus replied, very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born again
The “my leg” 💀
That fact that she’s in San Diego!!!🔥🔥🔥
Love the effort. But this proves why it's a male dominated profession
You try everything
dang good job on the line!!! Thats no joke when u up 40 ft.!!!
Michelle  you a never disappoints you stay committed on what you doing that why I subscribe to you at the first place such a bad ass 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Hey Michelle could you try training as a professional pianist! Thanks
how does one get a show like this???
Great work showing what it takes to become a SWAT MEMBER! always been intrigued by SWAT.
I love how they were encouraging Michelle when she was doing the obstacle course
I like how swat is realistic with training.. suspects just make you do 60 push ups.
You should try mountain biking
i know the instructors were fighting demons not to tell her to stfu
just like Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2
Have a great day God love y’all
This is my first time to your channel, just showed up as a recommended video. Great content!
are those real or tazer guns
Michelle you should try to be a bonds men/woman I rely on doing it.
Do a cia one
Nice!
That’s so badass! I can’t wait to get into law enforcement!! Thank you to all first responders out there 🙏🏽🙏🏽
1,245,689 views, 64k likes, 3k comments, 2.71M subscribers. Nice!!
I love seeing Michelle make videos like this, not only is she demonstrating that she's a force not to be reckoned with, but she's also providing an insight into these careers. She's giving a platform for trained professionals to debunk stereotypes and show how draining/difficult the job actually is while providing entertainment. Much love to Michelle!
“Push-ups” 💀
was it fun?
Admit it, you clicked because you thought that was Joe Rogan on the thumbnail.
It's not for women
I don't think this is a good job for women .
try the fire academy.
SWAT academy isn't a thing unless your a certified law enforcement officer within an actual department but no clue how you decided to convince them
Cool
Cool
Maybe I don’t want to be a swat member anymore
you should try to learn how to ride horses-
She could be a black belt in all martial arts
This out there but if anyone can you can get the green light for it, us navy warship on a training exercise, particularly a carrier.
A woman shouldn't get close to this
You should try jiu jitsu! My cousin had her first class tonight so she wanted me to comment this 😂
I was abt to say camera man fast asf but it was a car
You should do Air Force... Because my was is the air force.
Challenge not excepted
You should try being lesbian for a day!!!
Oh I thought you're a little boy
This looks so easy and fun🤩
Those were chin ups , not pull ups
Can you do the CIA
You should try to be a bodyguard
I challenge you to try doing the K-9 unit
You should try Air Traffic Control!
Can you pleaseeeeee do flight attendant academy. <3
Nice
Shark's machines Utah
damn i got streessed waching this
As a guy who watches firearm content on youtube, I wouldn't have found your channel if you didn't do stuff like this.   I think this is super freaking cool.
Constantly impressed by the high quality content you put out. You’re incredible!
That’s legit joe rogans face on put on the dude in the thumbnail lmfao
i wish i had the  opportunity to do this and experience what its like to be in SWAT
PRO S.W.A.T 🔫
Michelle you should try playing the violin I been a violinist ever since I was in third grade so I recommend you to play the violin with an orchestra!!!!

Absolutely beautiful this girl is, not just looks, everything about her is just adorable!!  Her actions, her laugh... Just such a babe!  🥰😍
That was amazing!!
do a became a piliot video
I love challenge accepted #pushthrew  Love the cámara work 😍
Try to train  I like the green Arrow
The way they stand it looks like a fortnight character
Learn how to drift
i am a fatass i weigh like 122 pounds and i cant do that
Tbh out of all the academy’s you definitely have a lot of experience so if you ever go to the military or anything you else you’ll probably be ready for it
Keep operating
Hey michelle try parkour a video would be good enough for challenge accepted
I wouldn’t be terrified at all if I saw you on the other side. I’d probably just laugh and give myself up willingly.
Danm
I think u should try pro airsoft
wtf is that an airsoft gun or a real gun? 19:00
I would  love for you and your partner to try a challenge together: professional ballroom dancing!
Wearing that amount of gear while dragging a dummy should’ve been easy! You dragged a dummy with 70+ pounds of added weight to yourself while in a burning building!  I’m kidding, that was a while ago.
I would really like to see Michelle try to become a gator wrestler. like off a airboat onto a good sized alligator (Of course with a taped mouth until she is comfortable enough to try it on a gator with no tape on its snout).
can you plz try to be a nurce or a doctor plzzzz i am the biggest fan ever plz
Who cares. Bye
Bon
killers are terrorists
4:56 explain this joke for a non-native please
I’m a competitive Irish dancer I would love to see you try it ☺️❤️
never could be me
This is like FBI OPEN UP!!!
Love your videos could you possibly try mountain rescue??
i absolutely love this series
Do next pilot
Do RASP (Ranger Assessment and Selection Program)
8:14 Not only the SWAT updated their rules from the Las Vegas Massacer but i can count a hostage taking case that happenned in Brazil on1999 when a armed gunman on Rio de Janeiro, hijacked a bus on the center, and when a sniper fired on the suspect, the bullet, hitted one of the hostages, keep in mind, that the bus was not filled with normal people, but an entire class full of children, teachers, and the sniper, hitted the wrong target, since then, the BOPE created a special unit that manages hostage taking scenes, and they didn't lost no hostages, since then
i didnt know laying down during pushups was allowed
Fake! she didn't cry once.
i did that obstacle course in pre-school lol.
I love your positive attitude and your drive to do better. 👏🏽
Michelle you are a bad ass!!! I'm sure that training was hard. Remember its mind over matter, you dont mind it dont matter!!
You should train with a professional aerialist!
Nice video, I wanna join SDPD when I’m old enough after high school 🚔💙
A michelle Khare video without a mental breakdown in the middle? thats refreshing ;3
Thank you and God Bless to all who do this service!🙏🏼❤️🙌🏼✝️ may our Lord be with you each always
Stronk woman
Another idea: D&D dungeon master and run a game
Can you please try doing broder patrol
San Diego Police are very kind and accommodating to let you (and by proxy us) try police training first and then SWAT training.
This is fake, you can't just go to a SWAT academy only because your a youtuber...
5:50 wait, are you telling me it's not like in the meme D:
Ai, video legal, mas na swat é facil quero ver no BOPE e na CORE do rio meu parcero, um salve do BRASIL👻.
I want to do this even more now
This is my first time watching your vids and i think ik gonna like it
Amazing video michelle. Love watching you do these amazing challenges. And seeing how youve done military, police, swat, and fbi training. Put all that together and do an airsoft milsim as a challenge.
Michelle is a goat ❤️
Call of duty in real life is so hard. Michelle is a beast. I loveee her
“R Rude” is the greatest name
And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.   (1 John 5:20)
You reminding of ROZE from call of duty warzone
how do you surrender to the swat without getting shot
it's crazy how she went from solving a Rubik's cube to this 🤣
FBI OPEN UP
No one not even criminals can touch her she has trained like police, military,SWAT, knows parkour which she can use to escape 🤣
I saw that one second cheat...that didn't matter.  And high ready? Dude, noooo, never do that. Always down.
She is covering her ears while she’s wearing tactical headphones xdd
u should try counter terrorism if they let you
Do schooba academy
THIS WAS INSANE! i might join swat but im in australia and they have a special type of swat in australia
WOW your videos and challenges are sooo GOOD!!!
You should be a pilot or navy seals next

Молодец!
This is the real life version of Mr. Beasts videos of this kind
how about a meditation camp/retreat (7-10 days)
Is it me or the doggo wants to start throwing paws at Chris
Epic!
Got confused on why a max is 300 but a min is 400?????
That was really cool. Shout out to all law enforcement professionals that honor their oath!

Border patrol academy!!
She's so adorable!  The smiles, the energy and the enthusiasm!  Amazing!
My guy needs to try sas
you should go on a week ride along with the SDPD and film it. I think it would eye opening to see what day to day cops go through
challenge: become president
Not sure if it would be possible, but it would be so cool to see you try your hand at being a pre-school or kindergarten teacher!  Harder job than it seems!
@Michelle Khare please do mma
How do you get permission to do this lol
You have one life but  If you feel like getting vengeance  Win that gulag
DID SHE JUST SAY 85 SECONDS?????? i-
As a Prison Guard. Watching your #challengeaccpeted videos all the time! Please try Prison Academy. Love from 🇵🇭

Why are you making this job look fun
For your next challenge you should try the United States Coast Guard
Hi

Good lord I can’t wait to try out for swat when I get out of the military.  It seems like everything I want to do as a grunt but without the stupid shit the military always needs to add in.
Shes so cute 😍
My uncle was swat for 23 years and he past away April 22nd 2022🥹
Everybody saying what other sports you should do: 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️🙋‍♀️ Me saying you try professional lying: 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️ Is that even a thing anyway?
Michelle literally can be any of these things (military, lifeguard, fbi, police, and others) she is literally AMAZING like girl slay you rock !!
Can you maybe do a video where you train like an Olympic horse rider?
I love the motivation of this girl literal definition of influencer
Try pilot training to fly a commercial plane with real people in the plane
Please do barrel racing with Fallon Taylor!!!! U will have so much fun
PLEASE DO K9 UNIT I THINK U COUD DO IT GOOD JOB !!!
Shit half the stuff I do at air soft clearing rooms I did out of instinct. I didn’t know that was a real tactic
Fire in the hole, stand by for breech in five... four... three... two... AD!

This girl is crazy cool

I live what you do. ❤
OMG this video was amazing
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
man, michelle is so fine
The course looks so fun!
As a corrections officer, I'd love to see you looking into that line of work if possible! Can't wait to see more! But if you do, don't just try cell extractions and riot scenarios, also go for experiencing the daily stuff like room and body searches, documentation, yard time, chaotic lunch and dinners, scenarios dealing with psychotic inmates in isolation, inmates with other types of mental illnesses etc. (I'm a Swedish corrections officer, so not sure if the US corrections are at all comparable, but I'd guess it kind of is)
Can you do boom squad
I wonder what it’s like when a flash bang gets you
man what a baddie
wasn't even doing push ups correctly
Hey Michelle just wanna love your videos good job your sooo cool and such a dare devil lol I really love your vids and you motivation you have and that you give others I also want to be like you but I need to first get fit and get athletic I am gonna try my best as I am fat rn.

Do the air force
Awesome!!
I insist, how about CIA training?
Love watching you try all these new things and give an insight into World's so many of us may never see 💗 Could you try a day in the life of super yachting staff? You could do all the different roles.
My toxic trait is thinking I can do this.  The only part I'd be good at is room clearing.
Can you do the TSA next?
That CQB looks fantastic, Michelle. Good work!
After these videos she must sleep for 3 years straight, jeez
I appreciate the amount of work and effort that went into making this video. I also think that we need to consider the ways in which institutions like the police and swat teams have harmed communities. I mean, swat was created in order to quell Black-led Civil Rights movements, and brutal policing tactics have caused a lot of death and damage in poor, marginalized, BIPOC communities. I think we need to be mindful of that especially in light of what's going on right now. I would recommend you to look at other perspectives from those who have be confronted by the police and swat teams and whether or not they feel like they are actually being protected. Read about how swat teams have policed Black communities during the crack crisis. Do these institutions actually live up to what they claim to do?
is there something this girl havent done? lmao
michelle, you watch too much cartoon and things like that, for god sake hahahaha
Let's go Michelle 😍🙌🏼
I would say try making it thru MARSOC Training with the US Marines AKA Marine Raiders THE HARDEST Training. I know from experience Yes it is harder than SRT
-video idea- You should try Criminal Academy!
Learn to play violin challenge.....
Michelle! You are a freaking boss queen! I love watching all your challenges! 💗💪👊
SOO cool!! God bless 🥰🙏❤️
Yes! I've been waiting for this. Can't wait!
CSGO players be like     (^-^)
I wonder what happens when you exceed the maximum
Training actors? aNd, doing a SWAT side hustle?
Michelle is doing for SWAT what BJ McKay did for truckers in the 1980s.  Great job. People need their jobs recognized as important.
I absolutely love these videos and am so impressed by how many challenges you take on! I'm a Correctional Officer and I wonder if maybe you've ever thought about taking on a CO challenge!
try sking
Acab
Muh strongk whamen,,, does 3 pullups lol. get in the kitchen and make me a sammich
You should try master chef.
I was waiting for the SWAT training, great job Michelle you nailed it.
imagine if she screamed "FBI OPEN UP!!" when she blew up the door
You should do, "I tried to be a Detentions Officer"

Holy fuck i would destroy that swat academy
substantive human rights states / nation unity end federal government

Sin made him evil.   Perhaps one of the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Honestly, why can't we just take a moment and appreciate the time and effort and money that Michelle puts in her videos. She is so super brave and super unique and also really pretty. Love you, Michelle!
Glad they showed proper muzzle discipline right off the bat - that drives me NUTS when they screw it up on TV. It's so basic, you'd think someone on set would notice that.
I like how you played the challenge @Michelle Khare
michelle why there are a maximum in sprint?
Quality content 👍
You should go to hogeans alley and try to become a criminal. And hide stuff from the police. But know it's all for a video
You should try horseback riding and then compete in a horse show.
pro gamer move breeching with krummulof lol
the obstacle looks fun
heart ?
Michelle you have got to try horseback riding! I think you would like it :)
Awesome vid but I challenge you to survive in an Amazon forest with someone like bear gryills or someone that knows how to survive in the wild
Is that a real that you are using or fake
I remember doing the CTSFO training and it was hardcore. We did a killhouse in complete darkness with shooting coming from all corners. It's hardcore
During the Flashbang intro, You were having flashbacks to Nam
This video is really amazing
OOH IM SO EXITED
You sure look like a soldier. I like it! You are f cking cool!
What work you like
I’m 14 and have been doing all this since I was around 7
subbed because gorgeous, stayed for the content. Lets goooo
Michelle busts the door down "GOOOOOD Morning!!!" 😂
Michelle! I've been waiting for this video for a long freaking time, I loved this video! Seeing Michelle learn the tactical side of it and everything was amazing! Big up 👆
if she got prepared to the test for like 1 year she would make the swat lol
Just imagine her job résumé under special skills : has done swat, FBI, 911 dispatcher, marine Boot Camp, police training and this are just ones I can remember on the top of my head
The camera man be like:💣🕴🔰
Awesome one! Awesome academy too
And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.   (1 John 2:17) - Repent. Jesus is coming soon.
I think you should try to survive Navy Seal Hell Week
10:52 i died laughing when the dude just put the door back on 😂
What cost for this all personal training??
Well i think i now Know what i gotta train cause im dreaming of being a swat officer
amogus
i was cheering for you so hard on the repelling
I have school but i woke up early for this epic video
you should try being a lawyer for a week!
When I grow up I am going to be swat and K-9 unit try K-9 unit I am your biggest fan ever love you and your videos more than anything else when I am sad you make my day better your the best YouTuber ever l love your videos so much
Hi Michelle! I really like your videos and I can’t even imagine how you do these things all the way through. I’ve been learning to ride for 3 years and I couldn’t even tell you how much I love doing it. I’ve learned hobby riding and I know it’s not as easy as it looks. So if you love horses and have time, you can also make a challenge video about it.
Only 1/4 mile, 20 puships, 30 sit ups and 6 pullups? Hmm... The catch will be in something else then. Here, just for basic level SPJ unit I need to hit 1km, 300m swimming, 40+ pushups, 10 pullups, all-motoric test of 30 reps and some more stuff. And thats not Strike Squad (Zásahová jednotka) ... They are arround 60+ pushups minimum, unless you hit arround 100, they are not interested.
It’s so good when they cheer you on. It’s literally pure motivation to finish
This how you should play cs:go
Lednsales - EBAY - Great media and collectibles for sale !!
Wonderful job Michelle! You did amazing in this episode along side the San Diego SWAT team! 💙🖤💙
S.W.A.T means Special weapons and tatice
I would love so so so much to try that out
The S.W.A.T dog looks like a good boy.
Hey michelle try bondage 😊
18:41-19:24 pov fortnite sweats
Finnaly swat team the best
This hands down has to be the best series I’ve ever come across it’s super inspirational and puts out such a good message for girls and boys of all ages that you can do anything if you work for it
I used to volunteer at my local zoo and I have to say that it’s a great experience learning about how to care for all the animals we had and teaching others about them whenever they walked through the area I was stationed in. Working with the animals was a very fun experience and the only reason I quit where I had worked was because I realized it wasn’t what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, but I don’t regret it one bit.
Next stop, SAS training
She’s trending 🥳🥳🤣😅🤣 yes girl yesss
like my comment pls
Imagine if that McDonald’s shooter walked in and there was a swat team in there eating 😂
Can you do train like a pro Airsoft player please please please
Awesome!!
You did great!
I love your videos truly inspirational in my own workout journey.
I got an idea try SAS in UK
You should try color Guard
She could make a super spy like James Bond.
Hey Michelle you are my favorite YouTuber and i have some ideas for your videos. If you haven’t done it yet you could do a video of being a pilot or a fighter jet pilot.you could also be the pilot of a ship or even carrier!
Okay this looks so cool. Michelle did a great job.
Can you go to a firing range and fire some guns please its almost my birthday
You’re obviously a CIA plant
Do CHP next!
When she was rappelling not doubt she felt like spiderman lol.
my dreamjob!
She shoots like a storm trooper
I didn’t think rainbow six took THAT much from real life
Coolest human on youtube....
“Like a dance, but I want a different partner”😂😂
pov sige players: this must be esay
19:31 why is she exposing her whole body like that?
17:41 did they ever go over muzzle awareness?
So I am not sure here. You have a armed suspect and possibly a killer why is the swat being trained to take them alive and not kill the killer? Do we want more criminals on the street? Is there a count after which the Swat decides to kill this guy? Just curious?
Great job on 34 on trending
American Ninja Warrior training. I'm just saying...
Fucken badass !!!
Isn't that last location the map from Modern Warfare?
I can't wait to be apart of SWAT in the future. I'm looking forward to everything they offer.
ugh i remember the las vegas massacre. it was crazy/sad to see what happened and what everyone had to go through during that traumatizing day
Lady, you are the most qualified, eligible, strong, independent and beautiful woman in this world.
Michelle i LOVE your hair in a Ponytail! <3
I could watch an hours worth of this. So fascinating.
San Diego  thats JUST YASSSS
I challenge you to be a highsecurity body gaurd 💂‍♂️
Girl did I peep you on blacklist 👀
That was a badass event - you did great - it felt like I was watching a movie with SWAT team on attack.
This was really cool to watch...and thank you to all the SWAT officers out there for doing what you do everyday!   I'm sure you don't get enough thanks, but you keep all of us safer!
Hello Michelle! Is it ok if you could do competitive swim? I'd greatly appreciate it if you could!💗😊
Awesome
air traffic control? pleaseeee
Bless you with another amazing vid girl! Whether doing something from totally different spectrums like doing parkour or hosting a TV show to doing dangerous and heroic things like this is just amazing, educational, inspiring, and fun to watch. I'd love to see you train/try to be a professional pole dancer, aerial dancer, volleyball player, and trapeze artist. Keep up the great work 🥰👏🔥
Michelle is like the real-life Kim Possible or maybe Barbie with all of these different professions
Have you ever exposed yourself to the equestrian community? I think you’d have a blast!
Can you do next I trained as a Prosecutor Lawyer in an Ivy League school. I feel like you would be really good at it because you need to be very convincing, confident in your statement and to help others or else they’re going to jail
That was a awesome episode of challenge accepted
PLEASE DO Air Traffic Controller
Same I already tried swat academy

I have got to say that was the most  fantastic video I seen really liked it
You should do ems training next
You are sooo much coooll can you try the army
I’ve been waiting since last vid 🤣🤣🤣🤣
First of all Michelle- your willingness to learn about jobs that are (politically) hard is incredible. Your willingness to to understand things like violence and gun safety if the whole net of being the first on the ground in moments of high stress high mortality is amazing. These aren't easy jobs, physically, emotionally or morally and you do such an amazing job stepping into them. I appreciate all of your challenge accepted videos. I'm a lady who carries almost every day of my life, and especially on days where I know that I'll be dealing with people who may or may not be good. Often I feel demonized for carrying or for other certain protection measures, and or have someone like yourself who can step outside of what they feel is safe and comfortable and bring new light allows me to feel safer doing things that make me safer.  (For instance, there have been times I've been jeered and followed for carrying, I   only carry when I know what my job may ask me to do that day. I'm 5'5 lady in a vulnerable line of work- I can go from asleep at 3 am to freezing cold by myself in the snow in the dark, with 2-4 strange men at 4 am.) I do feel like carrying a gun, pepper spray etc is necessary at those times, and is a more intense feeling when I'm followed into a parking lot for it (I have a conceal carry permit- but I do not conceal carry. I believe if I am armed in that way everyone deserves to know even if they may have I'll intentions.)  So thank you, for seeing and understanding what the hard part of the world is.
How can I try that training?
Did you know the first challenge accepted was I trained like a Victoria secret model
A lot of respect. SWAT teams are elite
I wonder how hard it is to not leak these insane video plans! Goodness
She is flagging the SHIT out of people with that rifle lol
my man can explolde doors and shoot people but cant draw a rectangle
THIS IS SO COOL
I love you.
its crazy how humanity need such people to protect other from idiots who are not able to life the rules
I love your Challenge Excepted videos! They're really eye-opening. Maybe next you could try a veteranerian, detective, or a P.I.
yeah i wouldn't mess with her
I think u could beat us all up 😆

I know this is a bad idea but on challenge accepted what if you tried to design roller coaster
Has Michelle done sniper school? After seeing this curious now. Having her do the shot and hide would be interesting.
now u can go in streamer's house to swat them :)
I love these videos! They give an interesting behind the scenes. Sometimes I get secondhand embarrassment from Michelle's comments though. Theses guys were not getting her humor.
michelle how can you be this awesome?
At this point I feel like this lady could become an actual cop or EMT or firefighter if she really wanted to with the amount of stuff she's done.
God bless! https://youtube.com/shorts/5ozK6FRiVnI?feature=share
I have another challenge do your bike racing again
Out of all of the challenge excepted was your favorite so far let me know
555
Her muzzle awareness: 2/10
You should do training as a kpop idol for a week!
You should try roller derby! It’s such a dope women empowering sport but there are so many misconceptions about it
acab
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
yo
how is this free content!!!!?!!!???
this is such fun video to watch! i really enjoyed it
Hands down LMAO
omg i love it!!!
Please cover the story of Jawaher Hajji #JusticeForJawaher
A good idea for a video is “I tried being the president’s bodyguard” I would like to see that!
do sf
Its not 2013 anymore. Blocked channel for stupid OMG thumbnail.
= }
Goes to show how much they have to keep up with physical fitness. I thought for sure you'd be able to do those pull ups after all the work to do 10. Also, love the port wine comment on carrying the weapon. lol
This video reminds me of rainbow 6 seige
Nice job of toughing it out. That training is rough. I also have a deep respect for heights and you did a great job on the wall. We also did the Australian rappel which is going down face first rather than backwards in the event you need to address a potential threat. Still, nice job and you have a great sense of humor.
it took her 5 minutes, but it would take me thirty. damn impressive.
I want to do it too now, i cant do pull ups and i need training for sit ups, probably cant run either but looks fun and your excitement on it was very cute and the guys just being pros likes its not a big deal, how do you go to do that things? Like you ask them if you can record and try the thing? And why the police saying on the badge was covered? That mask is dope af, ok the sound of the radio could be better, imma use some of these on video games for sure
For once we didn’t see tears in a video
I feel like this doesn't accurately paint the academy, pretty sure there isn't a team of people cheering candidates on
Great video! I just discovered your channel and this series is really entertaining. I would love to see a ski patrol video, they're unsung heroes.
swat: who tf is Michelle her: I’ll give you 150k  them: ok
Hjjk
Would that little birdie be "Garrett"?🤣🤣
You should try a day as an Olympic show jump horse rider
Speechless!! Amazing!! WOW 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Good job i don't think I could do this but good job u made a baby girl came out!!(last video
Damn  Glad I don’t want to do this lmao
a suggestion is participating in a raider ROTC event or drill ROTC event, it may be difficult but i would LOVVEEE to see that
Michelle, do you perhaps live in San Diego?
My favorite videos are your lawn enforcement videos please do more
Well done I love it
Can i get a hearth for watching your every video and waiting for new ones?😍
Michelle!!!! I’ve been waiting for another law enforcement academy video!! Love your bravery!! Keep going girl!
Please do try to draw anime and make manga and animations  Also try playing guitar and being in a rock band   Oh and could you try training like a K pop idol
THE WARIO APPARITION-https://youtu.be/DqozgvoHCVQ
Michelle, you are such a badass. I love your content! :)
I have a challenge for you. Taxi cab driver. it is something to research. I know trying to be London taxi driver is really challenging and would like to see what is the challenge on becoming a yellow cab taxi driver in New York
Great video. Loved it
I LOVE how Michelle always says i can do better!💜
Try area 51 academy
Alsoo love that the women were supporting you from the side it was the ‘you got this’ ugh🥺🥺
the best thing here is Michelle shows all imperfect clips, so we normal people can totally relate. That'll make this chanell perfect.
A lot more of Michelle's raw emotions and comments were included in the last few videos and I love it!
OOOMMMGGG Micheeeellleeeeeee you DIT IT AGAAINNN GURLL i cant tell you how proud i am of youu i swear you make me realize i am a strong woman and i THANKYOU sending you lots lots lots of lovee from holland 🫣🫣🫣😘😘🥰🥰🥰
No Michelle’s were harmed in the making of this video
you should try something music or baseball
I like how she's funny but she's actually understanding what they are saying
GO GET EM AND GIVE EM HELL
Exactly like what 12B (combat engineers) do🤩Plan on doing this after my contract.
Michelle I love your videos but this video and the etiquette video it seems like you’re taking these less seriously and just cracking jokes. It was fine with the etiquette because manners are harmless but I was uncomfortable with how much you kept joking about the breaching. These officers enter extremely dangerous and high stress situations and you were cracking jokes while they were all being serious. I feel like you used to acknowledge that but lately I feel like you may have lost touch recently about how serious and difficult these jobs are. We all appreciate the entertainment factor but there’s a time and place.
These videos are th best. She is a great person in general and thanks to her makes me learn things while being interested.😄
michelle, plz do “i tried to be a mechanic for a week”
Michele, you should be proud of yourself for doing these challenges and completing these. Yes, some maybe difficult yet you've done well and that you show us that you don't give up yet do all you can. Yhis takes so much guts and courage for doing this sort of job. Thanks for all you do. Keep up the good work. Also, to the cameraman you did a good job recording everything on different angles etc as this is not always easy yet you've captured most of it.
👍👍👍
I know you will probably not see this, but have you ever thought about doing professional rodeo for a challenge accepted video.
Try hackers academy
You flagged another swat member here :skull:
There's something about a sweaty female breathing hard in full gear. I have no idea why I like it so much. I LOVE female hockey players.
14:52 "hands down" lmao
i’m majoring in criminal justice & ur videos make me wanna do all sorts of jobs like SWAT, FBI, etc. lol. love ur vids michelle! thank you for working so hard ♥️
Next video: I tried Russian Spetsnaz training
Try to play a game call pubg
This was sick
2 likes, lmao
ABSOLUTELY AWESOME GIRL!!! Well done!! Looove #challangeaccepted
As Captain Price once said, "Check those corners."
Bravo Michelle!  👏  job well done
Military against the public academy.  SWAT should be illegal.
GOD bless you all Amen 🙏 for HE Loves you all Amen 🙏
Can you please try being a Medical Laboratory Technologist
1:06 Why is the maximum quarter mile time 55 seconds? Why would someone be disqualified if they managed to run it faster than that?
They definitely use a different voice when the camera isn't there 😏
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                    /. /.,                        /.,,/.,             ,/.,,/.                    /.,,/.,/..,/.,./,./,/
Michelle has the best job in the world!
Now show me how you carry a 220 lb dead man out of a building or out of a situation women need to stay out of the f****** combat situation
This is so cool to see that 🇮🇳♥️
MICHELLE SHOULD TRY FREE DIVING OR SCUBA DIVING THAT WOULD FUN
I would love to see more law enforcement agencies and military branches for videos that would be amazing, this was a amazing video.
nice vid
A girl in SWAT.  Hilarious :-)
Yoooo
the quality of these videos is unmatched. so impressive Michelle!!!
Who also remembered her talking about this video about 3 weeks ago
Bomb squad training?
https://youtube.com/shorts/qSLZDGbaZbk?feature=share
Great job! The best episode so far. Can’t wait to see what you do next!!
suggestion: trying nursing school
I don't know why, but in this video Michelle seems way more goofy and happy than other times and I *love* it 😁❤️
Training like a sniper would be Fire!
This is number 10 on trending
“Open the door normally? Or like....swat style?” 🤣🤣🤣
Michelle you look so fucking cool in your gear! COD PUT THIS CHICK IN THE GAMEEEEE
good video
Michelle Khare you should try Technical Rescue next.
I’ve been waiting for this vid since u announced it on the call handling one 😁
Try being a mother for 2 days that will be an awesome video
Do everything back back not consistently I wonder if anybody ever passed out
New found respect with every video great job!!!
What will she do next?!
You should try dive team academy
Awesome of this Police Service to do this with you! Love it
"ah meh leg"
https://youtube.com/shorts/3b75ERGnYGE?feature=share
ew not swat.....
https://youtu.be/cEvXa15kfqA
I have a swat t shirt I ride my bike for 2 hours
I wanna be you when I grow up😆I'm 20
Nice!
Now imagine a unit that trains for this very job about 12 hours a day, they can be shipped and on a target within 24 hours notice and if getting the job done means the entire team dies, they will die. That is basically who the seals are. Oh yeah, and they're about twice as fast at the job as the average swat unit
Yo I was so stressed at the end lmfao
I love your channel so much. The videos are awlays so entertaining and exciting. I also wanted to ask where do you sign up for these things. Keep up the good work
Challenge accepted is amazing love it. Keep up your hard work and we all appreciate you and the whole community and the services that are in the videos!
Love this episode you should do day in the life of a social worker
Sem nenhuma dúvida ela é sensacional
Michelle please never change. You are amazing!
The fact that she said “Hands down.”
you should try minecraft speedrunning and try to get a sub 30 run
This seemed like fun.. I would probably make it at this
Michelle is UNSTOPPABLE!
i know you might not see this but your my fav youtuber and you never give up
Hey Michelle, just want to say. DO consider joining. I think you could do a lot of good in similar departments etc.
That was intense Michelle!!! Amazing girl!! Keep it up.
So if you complete the sprint in < 55 seconds are you disqualified?
Michelle is ultimately getting ready to beat ww3 and alien invasion
You should do water rescue
Amazing at each and everything you have been challenged to do! I would be out at the sprint im so outta shape. Lol great job! And good luck with the secret service.
you should tri airsoft
I saw the 911 dispatcher video and u mentioned this video
I never realized how hard it is to train and practice the swat academy
Michelle, you are one incredible person! Just wow- You’re beyond brave, strong….and so much more!! The fact you stick with these challenges and finish them is incredible, you should be very proud!! <3
As a disabled athlete, I'd love to see you try some paralympic sports. I think having a woman like you get on a goalball court, or on a blind soccer pitch, or play wheelchair basketball/rugby would be amazing, and really beneficial to the sports. We need the publicity, and you could do a lot to help with that. Plus, you'd have a blast.
Must be great joining the SWAT team!!!!
Freaking awwsome video.. damn i want too be swat operator :)
you should try diving
14:55 HANDS DOWN!
"You're in my way, sir" is all i know about swat tactics
This woman is a unit
Net video what team military
Idea: state trooper 👀
I've been looking forward to this for ages. I loved it thank you Michelle
I’m surprised the lack of seriousness Michelle is taking this one.
I’m getting Call of Duty  vibes
I'd suggest by now she's received better training (in some areas) than many of us did after tech school/AIT/A school/etc. One on one with several instructors, cumulatively weeks worth of training over different professions but similar techniques. Lots of hurry up and wait in the real military. You can even tell based on use of force scenarios she's making faster calls. Plenty of other training needed but I hope she's taking it in. It's valuable.
She have been doing things people dont do in a lifetime
time to do CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
You are awesome and you’re incredible and strong and beautiful
I want to do what she does
She's charming.
So far the most interesting person I've seen on YouTube....these challenges are not easy but yet you stick up to them
To see her overcome her big fear, she has ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE 💪💪. This was very entertaining
And you Couldn’t it cause you’re a women and not tough  enough  !!
Girllllll u are amazing
Can we please get a “FBI open up” version with you
I just looooooooooooooooooooooooooove these videos
This was amazing! I have much respect for the officers on these SWAT teams.
this should be a youtube orginal series
i wish i could do this
Michelle should do try aerial silks sometime
I didn’t hear any old school motivational screaming which always helped me
Next challenge, SNIPERS!!!!
Next challenge, SNIPERS!!!!
Ha…..ha…..HAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I loved that they really made it clear It is not the mission to eliminate the target even if they have shot someone
!!!!!!!
Now that was just amazing ❤
When I think you can't make a more epic and interesting video you do this. It was so intense.
Quota hire
Awesome! I recommend horseback riding for the equestrians ❤
This was really cool to watch. And shows that shows like SWAT are fairly realistic. Also I think you should try to train for a pole dance competition. Pole is harder than it looks!
Michelle i dont like seeing u quite, Never give up to even think on giving up
With all these tryouts and trainings, you could probably be a real-life, elite LEO.
Try judo 🥋
Michelle, you inspire me so much and any time I think I may not be able to do something I just think of all you have done and it encourages me to be as strong and brave as you
That was intense
Do dentist next it might be boring but when I’m older I won’t to be one so please do it

mmmm, not with LAPD Swat
hands down lmao shes cute
Lets go girl! I have been WAITING for this vid! Great job girl!
What happened to the debrief section of these videos? Like a talking review and conclusion.
I love her expressions she's so expressive what a beautiful person !
You look good in the swat uniform! Looking like a legit one!!
Can you do a video on scuba diving?? I’d love to see you try that
It’s amazing what your body is capable of when you try! You are amazing!
hey im 2,183 comment sheeeshhh
Michelle you are so cute. I look forward to your videos. ❤️❤️❤️ Keeping making them and don’t let anything stop you. ❤️👍🏻
lmao when she dropped the officer and he goes 'my leg!' spongebob moment
....you litearly failed wtf✋😂😂
10 ON TRENDING!!! Nice job Michelle keep up the great work.
Didn’t even wait for him to say go lol
Thios is the most underrated channel on this platform. keep doing your thing
5:49 Have you not seen the one SWAT video in Dallas where SWAT blows the door up, pulls down a homes’s wall, smashes a window, and then just peacefully walks through the door?  I have!
That was actually even a good advice for gaming, if we heard all clear we don't have to look all around the room and can move on
I do a weird mix of sports: high board diving, trampolining, and unicycling! It would be really cool to see you try one or more of these sports (particularly diving!) :)
I just LOVE the happy-go-lucky energy Michelle gave, compared to the seasoned, serious, SWAT leaders’ energy. 🤌🏻😍
This was a epic episode of challenge accepted
Its remarkable how much personality Michelle has compared to these guys. I’m of course glad that the people that have this job take it seriously. But I’d rather work at the fire house I think
Being a SWAT is just like paintball but deadlier.
Salamat sa Diyos kay naa na jud! Dugay na ko'g tinagad ani 😅
So if u get 55seconds your to fast and won’t let the criminals have a chance at escaping 1:07
3:40 was sooo impressive
Michelle 🔥🔥🔥
i love you
You're a real life Barbie. Next you go to space
Michelle is one in a million type person, that person you'd want on your corner in any and all situations. She's also funny, smart, down to earth etc... Love her to death and I never even met her lol Queen 👑/Role Model etc
Great video Michelle. The last scenario was epic
Watching you finish that obstacle course without stopping,  you are a badass! I did a half of a tough mudder course after training  and it was soo hard. I was so impressed to see you pull yourself over a wall that is taller than you.
I love these challenge accepted, I have been watching them for a while but the newer versions (such as this one) I miss the 'challenge' part, ie. the prep that Michelle does just to get ready for this. I feel cause I didn't see it that the 'not passing' wasn't that big a deal. Like she said she been training for 4 months but there is no evidence of that. Honestly even if it was longer just to include that I would still watch it. This is a TV show!
Omg all I have to say is that the talent you have is insane. you are such a brave a fearless person, you are extremely competitive as well. We are beyond proud of you! And also I love your videos and the effort you put in them!! ily Michelle💕😩
Ounce I went to a baseball game and there was a shooting and it was terrifying
The fact that I feel she is fit and is still struggling makes me realize how hard these people work 😳
Only one word                                        Brillant
Can u do a video of where you do pilot school
Definition of girls are not weak 💪👍🔥
Michelle you’re honestly adorable, all the little references are cracking me up!
Ow my leg 🤣🤣🤣
i sta? volis patrijarha
I literally love your videos of challenge accepted. they are too cool ! .💪💪😍😍😊😊
damn  she's  a bad  ass girl  i need  to  marry  her  asap😁😁😁😁im in love
Badass girl!
I cringed when the instructor was saying how to be really good at breaching, and being careful and what not, as standing infront of a window
You should train to be a professional mermaid.
GOD BLESS OUR SWAT OFFICERS.
try flight attendant training pleaseee <3
i just started watching your channel! ive been waiting for this video to come out when you mentioned it in your last one!
Good thing she has paramedic training lol
That’s badass
It’s rainbow six siege irl lol
loved how she was being cheered on in the obstacle course
What is next comment
this was SO COOL
If you would like you can try the flight attendant academy 😊😊Well done I have trouble with self-doubt and you really inspire me😘😘
These challenges only keep getting better and better. Would love to see you with the K-9 unit or the horse police unit!
I also really appreciate how supportive your mentors were (eg. on the obstacle run). I really hope (and think) they do the same off-camera with the other trainees. It's amazing to have supportive teachers, not ones who just scream and criticize
Michelle sticks through these challenges and she has such a bouncy, happy, 'let's go' attitude that's impossible not to like
Why haven’t you posted in a lot of time
Wow
Love this video!
You are doing everything we wish we could do, it’s so cool to see what goes into all these things. You are incredible and can Literally do anything you put your mind too.. can you please do something with sky diving or something like that ??
Try training like an Olympic modern pentathlon athlete. Please?
Challenged finnished
Omg Michelle that was the best video yet! I was hooked onto every word said! That was so incredible 😲😲😲
Did someone got heart attack doing all these challenges? 😅
20:39 annnnnnnnnd tourniquet is gone lol
22582
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
Teacher: what do you want to be when you grow up?  Michelle: *yes*
Yes!!!!!
Wo
Michelle, you are amazing! But do you know who’s more amazing? THE CAMERA MAN! He/ she has no proper training and while you get introduced, they just sit and watch.
I have been waiting for this video since the 911 dispatch video came out. I am so happy that it finally came out.
Beauty 😍
What type of ammunition are they using? 16:50
Hi Michelle, can you please consider my last request about learning the 7 forms of lightsaber combat?
Maybe you could try body building and weight lifting?
"Hands down"😂😂
Not only did you learn something you probably inspired a whole lot of kids to joining the force or any of your other workplace challenges.
Idea beekeeping
Hello! huge fan! loved the video great effort! all I have to say is, I busted out laughing when you said hands down at 14:52, not in a bad way, I just thought it was funny. Great job!
Props for your dedication for every video going out and working so hard. Respect 🙌
Michelle can you try US Marshal academy please
I knew being SWAT would be cool
It's so cool to see you really take this seriously, but at the same time you can throw in a few jokes here and there!
Amazing, nothing else to say. I would like to see you try horse riding; I don't think you did that before. I love horses and would like to see you try it.
She should be careful they're used to her kind on the opposite side of the field....
your video's keep getting better, keep it up!
Try free soloing, ofc with supervision and not on any life threatening altitudes.
Does anyone know what kind of firearms the Police Academy/ SWAT Academy use during their training?
If there is a zombie attack she is definetly gonna survive
She not just making videos, she’ll becoming on Netflix
Bro i can just imagine: Hai bestieee *BOOOOFF*, come have breakfast!
I have no ability to be a SWAT but I adore you all. Stay safe on duty♥️🤍💙
B a u s army space force
Not everyone will be able to endure
early
you said 'hands down'
the flashbang flashbacks HAHA
"It is like a dance. But I want a different partner. " LOL
You should try a life, of a Programer!
Keep it up Michelle!!!
first
The instructor's footwork was art to look at.
can you please do trying cheerleading <<<33333
Hi
Rappelling backwards (normally) is extremely uncomfortable.  I can do it forwards (facing the ground), but there's something about being really high up + not being able to see where I'm going, that bugs me.  The first time I tried to bounce into a window, I smacked my head on the top of the frame... and the second time, I over-shot, got my feet through and hit my thighs on the bottom of the frame & had to clamber through.  It's a tricky thing to do, so kudos to you for not hurting/embarrassing yourself on the first try :D
This episode was so funny for some reason 😂 i love your channel
Western culture of protecting criminal´s life is shocking.
I love how one of the trainers at the obsticaul course just kept saying: C’mom girl
4:40 watch how the instructor has to MOVE out the way TWICE because of michelle’s poor muzzle discipline.
:0
Michelle your videos are incredible and I have a suggestion for you you should try k9 officer academy
So incredible, thank you for making these!
I’ve been waiting for this! I’m so happy to watch this rn.
Hi
FBI OPEN UP
I learned something new today! 💕 Swat is soooo cool ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Love these videos. I do wish you talked about your experience a bit more at the end like you usually do. I always appreciated your openness and vulnerability when going through these intense trainings.   Excited for whatever's next!
Sheriff SWAT or Police SWAT?
How to be a Rainbow Six Siege Operator:
So INTENSE!  Amazing!  Damned Ruffin Rd!  ha   The shape charges are Carayzee!   & I was really surprised to learn there are different intensities to the flash bangs!  Super Kewl y'all!  Mass respect!
Nice video keep up the great work love you and your videos you are one of my favorite YouTubers ❤️👍
I have waited for this.
she is who shows up when you beat someone at xbox
Hii Michelle okay wow I just started watching you today because your 911 dispatch video was in my recommendations and I looked at ur account and I’ve binge watch your challenge accepted videos! I say my favorite one was the paramedic one girl you are so brave I just finished watching the police video and you were so strong you are an amazing person uploading these kinds of things you are probably the bravest youtuber I’ve ever watched keep continuing being you<3
You should do a rodeo queen pageant
Every time I watch her police videos she always reminds me of that bunny from Zootopia😂
I bet all of the R6S players are going insane rn watching. Most of this video is what happens in R6
me: yes swat  her: call of dude irl
We call it a red key
TRENDING YESSSS
Awesome stuff. Gotta love that 9x flashbang lol.
michelle: the swat has arrived me: FBI OPEN UP
This woman literally has the experience for every job in the universe…
Honestly', Michelle should have been a cop in an alternate life.
As a competitive swimmer people always tell me that it is easy or that it is not a sport. Would love you to try competitive swimming challenges
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS ONE.... TURN IT UP!!
The movie scenario thing looked fun
"my beautiful illustration of a room" same
this is as good as a tv series
In the final scenario why dont the swat team already have the vest on, why do they have to put it on after they arrive
I actually enjoyed the video. Great work. Great footage. Great editing. Exceptional work here!
Pass
22:38 - The non-verbal signals are the COOLEST to catch. I loved that you got to experience so many of it. 😍
Omg
It's not a shame not to pass that test people have been preparing for such a test for years these are elite teams and there are strong reasons why it is so difficult to get into them
try coast guard academy if that even exists or being a lawyer
I found your channel about 2 weeks ago, since then I have probably watched like 30 videos on your channel. Im really enjoying the content keep it up
9:35 good morning starshine the earth says hello
This was deff a fun watch but you didn’t seem to take this as seriously as previous episodes. The gravity of what SWAT does is so immense and you seemed way more jokey in this one. Still really fun to watch. I had no idea they had to be trained in all those things and that obstacle course was one of the harder ones you’ve had to do. Deff an impressive group of people who do that everyday
nahhhhhh that last part of the video looked real than fake
That was so bad ass
This was so cool! Police officer, FBI, and now SWAT training. The legendary trio!
Truly incredible
YOU MISSED 'L' IN YOUR LAST NAME
can you try being an equestrian? I think that would be fun for you!
YES!!!! THE VIDEO I HAVE BEEN WAITTING FOR YASSSS OMG ILY
"operator"? lol
Try bed academy with me;)
You're so strong and beautiful keep up the good work!! 💖
You should train like a sniper
Watching Michelle’s videos is like watching a documentary.
What did the suspect at the end throw out the window?
Try professional air soft
In Christmas of 2021, I was just down the road from a Walmart shooting.  There were a ton of police cars there, and we saw SWAT teams gearing up.  There were more flashing lights clustered in one area than I’ve ever seen in my life.  You never want to call that sort of thing “cool”, as it’s happening in a really bad situation, but it was very impressive to see such capable law enforcement.  Thankfully, not a single person got hurt.
Everything you do is so fantastic. I especially love your episode with emergency dispatchers. I work in the funeral industry and hope to see you one day taking a leap into our world. It's a very special profession that I think has a lot of misconception and less than stellar connotations, but we're really just here to help people go through the most challenging transitions of their lives.
CIA and Air Force next? 👀 You're the coolest Michelle!!
you are you amazing. can’t wait for more
so far my favourite video
It's only a small section of the video, but the brief focus on the Las Vegas shooting stood out to me as someone who researched the subject, it's interesting to see the news reports as I didn't have access to them.
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!
No way omg your a legend Michelle
Try sniper arcade my next.
Its my birthday today turned 13 haha CANT WAIT FOR WHATS NEXT THIS IS INSANE
Hey @Michelle, I personally would love to see your resume. I am truly amazed. I also think you should do a segment where you bring a subscriber to try and do a “Challenge Accepted” video!
If you take any video ideas here’s one  “I got treated like a president for a week”
Plot twist Michelle is a undercover spy thats is trying to figure out the tactics for all USA law enforcement agencies. And shes using a YouTubers identity as a disguise😏😏😏
why did they do the cross thing on clearing a room most militarys do guns up and then breach the corner that he cant see u can see the hard corner ez i belive
“call of duty in real life is so hard” i love her so much 😂
Woman...
IM GOING TO SWAT ACADEMY SOMEDAY
Imagine just eating breakfast and just seeing someone just do down a building 😳
Ok I played gaga ball for like 3 hours yesterday and I can't even walk today so I can not even imagine doing this *at all*     No bc im not even being dramatic like it causes me phsycial pain to walk
FINALLY !
Michelle breaching: *Good morning* 😃
Does Michelle do a paratrooper trainings?
Keep up the good work Michelle I love your video
Wow are u actually 29 u DONT LOOK 29 more like 21-23 love what u do
This is so epic Michelle keep up the good work
#EndNoKnockWarrants #EndDrugRaids These two "Tactics" kill/murder more American's than those super awful and dangerous ASSAULT WEAPONS each and every year. Do your own research, look at the real problem and issues from verifiable and reliable/accurate FREE information out there people. The squeaky wheel gets the lube, unless people get rallied up and start speaking to their reps, this problem will only continue. The war on drugs is an absolute and total embarrassment, it shouldn't also continue to be a death sentence for those the police deem to Raid/SWAT team enter their homes and apprehend.
I just finished ur last video.
Best one yet!!!
been waiting this for days <3 keep up the good work!
Do border patrol !!
I want to give it a try like Michelle did. She is very beautiful 🤩 by the way but that doesn’t matter. It is her determination, grit, and personality that count. Thank you for doing all this! 😊
Hey guys I’ve got some really great news to share with you, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died and resurrected on the third day so you may all have eternal life. If you repent of your sins and put your faith and trust in Him as you would a parachute jumping off a plane at 25000 feet up in the air, He will give you eternal life in heaven as a free gift and I promise you, He will change your life forever as He did mine. He is the ONLY way to heaven and He loves you all. Thx for reading.
After watching Netflix series "S.W.A.T", this video was a real treat!! Great work!!
This content is so interesting but I have played and watched Rainbow Six Siege tbh
Every time I see SWAT team getting into action therefore I’ve imagine them as clone human beings followed by same body shape, skills, tactics etc. I’m sure they will perform a lot better compared to regular humans.
Michelle is one of the bravest and most determined YouTuber I know. Your videos are awesome! 💖
I think you should be more serious with these things it’s just my opinion but I love the challenges and it’s really amazing you took this oppr
I swear your drive is unreal. I have mad respect for you.
Can you do a CSI
Michelle try the us airforce :D
She’s so fkn amazing like it’s crazy she can do everything I wish I was more like her she’s a true inspiration
Great job Michelle! One of the best ones yet! You are always very solid on these challenges, it inspires this guy here.
Can anyone else agree that she looks like a professional with whatever challenge she does!
That last scenario seems like the sort of thing that would be fun while it's fake but horrifying when you actually have to do it and lives are actually involved.
Next can you do army academy
Nice video
LETS GOO IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS YESSSSS
U are so cool
You're a natural. Ever think about law enforcement or maybe secret service?
the SWAT is the police unit but they are the super force swat idk
I like how she's covering her ears for one second and he says "questions?" and she's like "no." in like an aggressive way lol
I love the missions 😭❤
Michelle is so inspiring and amazing! I am so happy YT suggested a video of hers a couple weeks ago. I've been binge-watching and loving her videos. She makes me feel like I can do anything.
Train like a competitive swimmer!
YEAAAAAAAAAH
can you also write the distance/weight in km and kg for the non-American folks in your channel? thanks
Hi your such a brave person am still young and I want to be a nurse in the future and I was wondering if you could go to a nurse academy so I could see how it would be to be a nurse
why don't you bungy jump
How can you ask the SWAT to make a video and tell their secrets and training ?
The 9 bang for call of duty ghost 17:07
Finally it’s here! I’ve been waiting for the swat academy!!
why don't you try airsoft or nerf and win a BATTLE
Oh baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great video
swat is just amazing, its awesome to see it, i would drop dead after running for 20s
I lowkey felt tired in her place while she was doing this part 3:10

You should do bounty hunting one day
Woah your very brave and you push yourself beyond! Keep it up!
Loved it!, how about be a pro skydiver?
Literally no one cares
What training hasn't she done?? 😂
"You hear this noise and it's ME on the otherside? *cheerfully* Good morning!!"  BIG Officer Judy Hopps vibes right there
I actually got tense while watching the final scenario. Great job Michelle.
This was another incredible video! I'm excited to watch the next video! I just have one small suggestion/video idea: Make a video where you try to learn the hardest card game, Bridge!
Michelle, can you try playing on a professional lacrosse team? It's a rough sport.
MICHALE UR THE BESTTTTT! I've been like checking ur channel everyday waiting for u to upload ur awesome!!
The real question is, after doing every cool job America had to offer, which career do you think is the most interesting?
Can we all just appreciate the amount of effect    Michelle puts into these videos
The vidios keep geting better and better.
The kkk squad
Day 2 of requesting you to go to USAFA (US Airforce Academy)
finally
Love seeing them in action.
Yes!!!! Good job
LETS GO!! She said she would do it in the 911 video and she didn’t lie.
SWAT OR FBI?
Nobody cares
Could you try the California Highway Patrol academy? I would love to see that video:)
“Questions?” Michelle: “no” ( looked like she had all the questions 😂😂 )
You did so great in this vid!!! 🥰
I love seeing myself in you ignore the haters.
Quick question, at 1:07 What does it mean? Because I thought it should be "minimum 55s" and "maximum 85s" but idk if im just confused?
try delta team/force special forces academy if you can!
Navy seal suits you better
Are those requirements just for females? what about male requirements?
I know we have all been waiting for this video and let me just say you definitely did not disappoint this is one of your best episodes so far thank you for blessing us with this content keep it up
Barbie could never lol
"Call of duty in real life is so hard" I have not agreed with a statement this much in forever
How does she find all of these oppurtunites
Can you try Wildland firefighting hand crew it is one of the toughest jobs  and it’s very different from structural firefighter
I was just looking for swat academy the other day and now you uploaded this video which helped a lot
You should do an episode on snipers.
I love this. Your weapon is your eyes when clearing rooms btw :p
what do you say when someone asks what is your job
14:44 HANDS DOWN..... HANDS UP
who else have been waiting for this video ??
wwwwwwwww
the wonder woman Michelle, you are amazing girl, you are an example to many girls to achieve whoever we want...love your videos... like, like, like....
nice
Still can't believe I'm watching this for free .. this is better than alot of Netflix series
15:29 The guy would have totally shot the hostage when he got shot in the arm
They were all way too serious for her jokes .. lol
That scenario was so cool and intense! Pretty realistic. Even though she didn’t pass, she sure did well lol. Growing up I wanted to be a swat sniper
On swat you only see white dudes it rare to see black or Mexicans LoL I wonder why 😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯 damn I hope we're not the criminal's LoL💯💯💯💯💯💯😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😂😂😭
this is what i feel like in laser tag games lmao
I never knew SWAT used K12s
You do so good in your video
She is so funny, in a lot of the videos from her, that I have seen, she says something funny and makes the other people laugh, which I find very amusing. ❤️
Just that your numbers were so close is impressive
Can you please do flight Attendant
Seriously, you video inspired me to to beyond of my physical defining. You video are challenging and see to all dream become true , love from India.
YESS FINALLY ANOTHER VIDEO I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO TO COME OUT SINCE U SAID IN THE 911 DISPATCH VIDEO.MUCH LOVE!!!
A big city SWAT team could easily defeat any special forces unit in the world.
Michelle, I’m really disappointed in the ways you’re celebrating police violence.   Brianna Taylor was murdered with a no knock warrant by SWAT.   You and the SWAT team are glorifying “shooting bad guys” in ways that make me sick to my stomach.   I wish these videos took a nuanced look at policing etc., because the swat team are not the good guys. You’re showcasing them learning tactics from mass shooting events and teaching that murder/ gun violence from police is cool, but when the bad guys do it, we kill them.   I wish you showed how they use restraint, or only shoot as a last resort, or ways they are working to be less biased etc.    I wish you took a nuanced view of policing, instead of the bullshit hero edit
do air 1 academy next
That was incredible. I love watching your police/swat/ military videos. Keep up the good work.
That was dope, you can see your previous challenges experience helping you out here. You are zombie apocalypse prepared.
Thank you This was so awesome,  inspiring and  adventurous to watch .👍
The moment I saw this video I just started reciting the universal rules of gun saftey word for word. Also this acronim! Mats, muzzle , action, trigger, saftey. And mind you I'm only 12
Nice
Yep im about to say its COD in real life
i live for this series!
I just want to take a moment to say thank you to Michelle Khare for doing these videos. It shows that each profession i.e. Police, Firefighters, FBI Agents, Paramedics, SWAT, etc, that each profession is more difficult than what the world make it out to be. I love seeing these videos of yours. It gives me hope to actually be successful in becoming a Police Officer in the near future. There is a huge need for more people in each law enforcement profession and I hope that I am able to get in and do my part sometime soon. I am still in physical preparation / conditioning so that I am more than ready to apply, then dig in and start working. Thank you for sharing this video. I appreciate it more than you'll ever know.
Her YouTube is literally her Resume. So impressive!
This is like mission impossible type stuff
Can shote unarmed people in wrong house?
congrats on your success
Chill wit that thumbnail 🫠
Michelle’s kindergarten teacher: What do you want to be when you grow up? Michelle: *Everything*
The team work is always important and more with dangerous environment ! What a great Job you have done Michelle, showing us the swat team work
Respect to the Camera man for recording that.
16:05 “call of duty in real life is so hard”😂
I saw a training course where a reporter tried it, and when he got to one part of a set up house, there was a guy standing on a chair about to hang himself. So of course the reporter tried to talk him down. When the actual guys in training did it, they tazed him right away, which I would have never thought of to do to someone about to hang themself. I've noticed that men in this line of work are very aggressive.
Is there anything Michelle can't do?!
Was waiting for this lol
After watching your challenge accepted videos, I'm curiously wondering if you have ever loved one of them, so much so that you'd do it as a career - if given the opportunity? You're just so good at them, and at challenging yourself. I absolutely love watching them again & again ❤️
Wow!
So cool
Hey Michelle, it would be super cool if you did a challenge accepted on skateboarding.
This woman is absolutely incredible. The mental strength she has to put herself through these tasks. Half the world doesn't understand what goes into being an officer or marine. She is such an inspiration
I have a legitimate question: Whatś more important, helping the victim or catching the criminal?
I LOVE THIS SERIES 😩
Being a cops daughter and my dad used to be part of SWAT, I thought it was super cool to see what what it is like when my dad went into SWAT before I was born.
Go Michelle!
This was one of the best challenge excepted episodes
I have been waiting for this video for so long  My dad is on the swat team and this is so cool to see you do!!!
Can you do the Coast Guard
No discredit to the SWAT team or their fantastic work. Just a general disclaimer.  I came home from doing the laundry about six years ago when my mom called me very upset. A few hours away in Boston Massachusetts a bomb went off in the marathon finish line. The terrorists had left a backpack with a pressure cooker bomb in the crowds and no one noticed until the explosion.  No matter what goes on around you and no matter what security is there. Always keep vigilant about your surroundings. If you see a backpack, or a bag, or anything suspicious, IMMEDIATELY let someone know who’s a police officer or security.   It’s better to overreact than under react in a situation. Don’t scream it and don’t move the object, just quickly and quietly let someone know that’s part of the security force.   It’s better to be the saver of many than the hero who died because you panicked or wanted to be a hero.
I love all of the Challenge accepted videos! :) I learn so much from them and I think that your so amazing what you do :) Can't wait for more!!!!
Can yo do a the navy
Thank you so much.
How about you try to become a police Detective?
If every tik tok liberal would do this, the world be a much better place.
Been waiting for this video 💯💯
❤️❤️❤️
when the suspect was armed was it a real gun
ive been waiting for this
I swear Michelle will do anything
I love Challenge Accepted Videos! Keep on doing them, Michelle! Your my favorite!
She’s definitely fit
yesssir
I clicked so fast when I saw the notification, underated youtuber she needs her own network like Oprah
Michelle khare is a total badass
Ayo these are awesome! Can we see Sniper school next?
I swear pull ups are the mortal enemies of 95% of the population! The other 5% are cheating somehow, someway!!
Wooooow 🥹
She's literally so inspiring 😭 <3
I have a challenge for you i feel like it's something that o=is a really nice challenge and fun called surfing
Wow, I really respect Michelle's determination. She's been training with the best of the best in so many different jobs that require you to help others and instill strength and confidence in oneslf.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KazD_vv9VxQ&t=170s

i LOVE when Michelle says « girl » 😂
You Should Try Airforce Training Camp
e
I HAVE TOO MUCH TIME WAITING FOR SWAT OMGG
Try air born but you don’t need to jump out a plane.
Hey Michelle, I love your challenge accepted videos and if your open to one I would love to see you do my job as a emergency room worker I think you would  really be challenged and learn a lot especially during Covid
Wish you would’ve kept it a surprise
It's finally here!!!!
That’s so sick!
The only thing more I want. Is some time at the end explaining your experience and your opinion.
You should try k9 trainer
You should do gymnast training it would make me so happy :)
Michelle, you would be the most polite SWAT officer ever as you bust the door down with your awesome smile saying "Good Moring!" haha  Keep kicking butt, your adventures are so fun to watch!
hi Michelle I wanted to ask if you can please try horse back riding it is very underestimated and I would love for you to prove the none horse riders that it isn’t easy 😊😊😊😊😊
yeah women! no match for men
Damn I wanna do this!!
Try more boot camps like Coast gaurd, air force, army, or navy
Michelle I love your video’s and u are so brave and strong.You earned an subscriber
THAT WAS AMAZING! WOW! KEEP UP THE GREAT AMAZING WORK
You should try being a construction worker
This has to be the coolest YouTube Video i've ever seen holy shit, that last scenario was just awesome!
You should do vet Academy
i think ill pass on that workout app
Another BANGER of an episode!!
Girl power
I like when you do challenges that show intense job/work people do daily. This are the position which should have the highest paying because they truly safe people everyday! Sorry for the harsh truth however I think that "influencer" as a job is overrated because they won't be able to feed or save the nation from it's problems, nor they care about people that much. Like money they have mostly go to them, like wake up people. Nothing is wrong with being influencer, but never forget who truly deserves an applause 🗣️
This was sooo coool
My inspiration
THIS IS SO NICE
IVE BEEN WAITING
I’d love to see her try  Navy seals hell week. I know she did the navy seals test but imagine Michelle trying Navy Seals training.
I NEW IT
Michell you should do navy or Air Force
Amazing job Michelle!!
14:50 Imagine one officer screaming at a suspect "Hands up!", then another screaming "Hands down!". A new technique of confusing a potential threat... 🤣
they train you to be a cnn  broadcaster lol not a fbi
<<<<<<<<< Big deal lol
you should do one on forensics your videos are very inspiring to watch
Can you try to be a marine biologist please
This is so cool you are literally my idol because you prove you can do anything and that is so amazing!!💕💕
“Stand for breach in 5, 4, 3 -, Multiple cats? No Problem the Litter Robot, it comes with an in home thirty day tria-“
This was incredible , Very much enjoyed this episode 🤘🏻
U should try ATF next

I dare you to try Flight Attendant academy.
YESSS
Wow!
Love your vids
7:10 I love Michelle's dynamic with the team lol
You see Michelle going through all this intense training and these activities BUT NO ONE TALKS ABOUT THE CAMERA MAN DUDE MANS A LEGEND IN EVERY SINGLE CHALLENGE and the footage is AMAZING
LOVE YOUR VIDS
I love how bubbly these swat people were
I was waiting for this so bad!
You do well in these types of scenarios. And getting skilled with the rifles. Kinda hot
try becoming pro da  hood player on roblox lel
YES YES YES.... I love Challenge Accepted videos thank you!
I love how Michelle never gives up
I think you are the best YouTuber, period.
Can you do the CIA
If you find this comment I want to ask you if you can try the sport bowling. It would mean so much to me if you could. It would help show people that bowling isn’t a club it’s a sport. Also I love you and what you do.
the fact that Michelle is, despite being in great shape, tinier than most people doing these things, you have to give her mad props in the jumps as she has a greater disadvantage. she's only 5'2, that's _amazing_ ! Michelle, I applaud you for these videos and giving everyone some insight  into what goes in to each subject.
“Its like a fine wine” yer so awesome!!!
You should do a video on stunning on a bike
hi
I wish I could train like this! So amazing!
Why are people saying this is easy
great job and fantastic video
Try Airborne academy next 👀
Waiting for this one
Michelle you slayed that repelling! You did sooo good!
I love this awesome as always michelle
The facts that the video time is 23:19 lol
CHALLENGE ACCEPTED IDEAS: Muay Thai/Krav Maga fighter WWE/AEW Superstar Video Game Creator Dancer (Hip Hop or any other style)
I think be cool she try to learn Irish Dancing that is physical and mentally difficult. Doing something with paraolympic be cool.
How do you get the people to accept cause I wanna do that in my area. Just to try it out.
Seeing them put the explosive tape on the door sure seemed like slower way to get in than just punching it with that thing 😂😂😂
Been waiting for this for a while
I'm a disabled man and you're an absolute inspiration to men, women, children, and people like myself.
You should do competitive cheerleading and actually compete with a team
👩‍🦳Are not 💪🏻
FBI OPEN UP!
Ik that was not a 77 second run
If you have a fear of heights you should do paratrooper school you might get over the fear
I wanna be a SWAT officer now lol
Honestly, these are really helpful for high schoolers looking to get real an insight on what goes on in different career fields. SWAT is not for me, but I finally a lot go these videos super helpful! Thank you so much and keep up the good work ❤️❤️❤️
I'd love to see you take on Rock Climbing, Michelle!!! Especially since you say you're not a fan of heights - that was how I originally got into it, personally! I wanted to get over my fear of heights (it didn't go away but when I'm climbing, I'm not scared at all). And seeing how you enjoyed rappelling, I think you'd have a lot of fun! You could pick a 5.10/5.11 difficulty multipitch as an end goal and try to learn to lead climb (or just do a "normal" partner climb with an anchor/someone else leading). You'd be a natural!
Jeez, you've done all these things and never gave up! I admire your perseverance.
OWOWOWO
These videos you make really cool and eye opening to know how things work!😉
I have been waiting fr this so bad
i think i was accidentally unsubscribed. i am pretty sure i was subscribed though
I wish she took this more seriously
Michelle is the definition of "Everything is possible"!
Try Johnny sins  Title will be " i tried big guns "

S.W.A.T Special Weapons And TEAMWORK.

Yay
hehe new valorant tactics
Haha, Michelle has gone from *serious worried Michelle* to *having fun it'll be great Michelle* and I'm here for it! You seem very relaxed!
Looks fun and easy I want to do the challenge
Try secret service next
one thing that I noticed is that when you were in the training, before you jumped to get up the walls you took a mini jump which cancelled almost all of your momentum, so if you don't take that small jump you can jump higher, or you can swing your arms to gain upwards momentum
This was my favorite of all your vids!
Imagine opening the door right when they blow it up
I dare you to try work as a train driver
dislike because of ads
BEST VEDIO EVER I LOVE IT
Woop woop!
"things escalate quickly around here! haha"  yes they do ... *PTSD FLASHBACK*
It's around that time, try professional marching band!
good job must have so much mental stability to put yourself through this. Good job girl!but also I laughed so hard at 9:30 - 44 it was hilarious, love ya!
This is one of the most badass eps, Michelle. Your instinct for swat is great man. Keep going, even on what you call your bad days, you're doing your absolute best and showing us what it's like doing things. Proud of you, kid.

I'd never imagined the SWAT team being so sweet! The one with the dance partner, the one with the "Clear. All Clear." thing... Amazing how cute they are. :D
Pilot accaky

I love this series. You are so brave 😎😎
all gamers rn imagining theyd be doing these scenarios easily haha
I love when she says “gurlll” 😆 it’s so real. ❤️

Great video Michelle! I’m interested in joining a SWAT team in the future so this helps!
More like challenge declined
Michelle I would love if you tried competition dancing as a competitive dance myself is so unfortunate that people don’t give it as much attention.
She’s really just living life to the fullest
The fact you went in there so UNPREPARED is beyond PATHETIC,  EMBARRASSING and shows nothing but disrespect for everyone that wears the uniform.

Love this challenge so much to see what Swat actually do in a day to day life, their job looks so hard because there is so much that is going on that you have to make split decisions.
You are a cool person I like your videos keep it up and you should be very proud of you

I am so proud of you
This kind of job, I think that I can do that sick job as a swat officer.
This would be so cool. What a great opportunity. I wish she took it a little more seriously though and not been such a jokester… I get that it’s supposed to be entertaining but it’s SWAT which is a pretty great opportunity to work with even if it is just for a video!
you should try to be a undercover cop
Hi Michelle, what I was wondering is, would you know of someone who can help me through my first ever full marathon

Is anyone else having quality problems? :( I have the highest and it looks like the lowest.
Thank you for not being afraid to show what these brave men and women do and are faced with everyday around the country. It’s easy for people to bash the profession, but not everyone has the guts to do the job. Thanks for humanizing both the military and law enforcement .
Yayyyy!  Been waiting for this video hehe 😊
All these tests are a joke to me...take me to SAS UK 🇬🇧
2nd time for asking for k9 stuff :D
Tough to do after only one week training

Still waiting for your collab with Dr. Mike.
Michelle you look like an expert! I really like your videos!
At this point I wouldnt be suprised if you became a reputable brain surgeon in a week
Love all your vids girl. Like damn you a boss. A lot of people talk the talk when it comes to Leo's and swat and all that but you show how hard the job is and how it's a split second decision and how hard that choice is. You have never given up even when terrified. I love you giving part of your platform to others who serve us everyday. From your EMS training to fire academy to police, swat, seals etc. It's beautifully insane. You push past your fears and don't give up. You have a rare work ethic and it shows. You give every situation your all and I applaud and appreciate you in every way. Much love and respect boss lady...
can you to navy plis
Omg you should try training like a kpop idol I think that would be so cool and something that we would love to see!!
cool as always. keep it up ms. michelle
You did awesome Michelle
2.69million subs what a coincedence
It's her bubbly charisma that makes this great entertainment
Nice!
Michelle you did great on repel. Plenty of Army trainees get stuck or start crying on the tower. You sucked it up and got the job done good shit boss lady!
This chick though
Bro imagine how much she trained for this
my dad is in S.W.A.T that is so cool to me that you did this.
You should be a brick layer
this is actually so poggers. i wish i could do this one day
1:08 I think minimum and maximum are switched
I laughed soo hard when i saw “sub so we can convince the secret service” XD.  That would be super cool to see tho. The secret service dosent really do thay because they protect the president and cant share their tactics
She never misses on any of her videos. They’re always top tier quality.
Try CIA academy
Waiting for this one!!! 🍿
The scream at 17:00 I was right there with you girl 🤣 I’m dying
It's always such a pleasure to see these professionals being so encouraging! Like the girls telling Michelle to keep going on the obstacle course😂  They all seem like such good trainers and mentors
I love your videos Michelle! This week was so action packed! I love these challenges!
oooo early!
Yo R6 IRL

How is it possible that such a badass can be so freaking cute?
New video!
YESSSSS, LETS GOO

Repelling is so fun I climb and repel down and it’s the best
Hi fellow Michelle we ruling the world good luck
Id be terrified if I heard Michelle's voice knocking my door down.
Hii
Michelle, love that you are highlighting all these important careers, great job on  your work!!🇺🇸🇺🇸
I loved this video keep it up
I would give anything to do this holy cow!your one lucky girl,and have a great job lol👍💪
One of the highest quality contents I've seen on YouTube. The Challenge Accepted series is beyond amazing. Keep up the great work!!
Youbr just the best
This video was great! I have a suggestion, you could try to be a dog groomer or trainer
She should try airborne training
its a good video but when the do the movie set with the helicopter those helicopter have guns attached to them
This was a a really good video you should try the Air Force lol
love u mk!! i love ur videos, ive watched like 50 in 2 days, love this series man, thanks for living ( lol )
I am pretty sure the dore nocker is called a battreing ram
This was epic
nice i just came home from the danish army  (im 15) and it was funny that this was the first video i watched when i got home
This is soo weird I was just thinking about what challenge you are going to do next. And I automatically said Swat team would be cool. And boom! Here it is.
Michelle, you're a certified BADASS, and we're all proud of you for completring that! #BacktheBlue #IGY6
6:40 "It's like a dance, but I want a different partner" lolll
that was the most girly swat training in the human race , its not place for girls 🤦🏻‍♂️
great video!!! the training is tough but is much needed!  the team bond that is formed is greatly needed. like always, great energy and strength!
Okay, you need 4M+ subscribers!
Good
These are almost the same tactics used in the military for urban combat, except SWAT has a tougher job since there are more civilians around and they can't blindly throw in frags
Hey i love you michelle. can you do gosthunting again but thins time do it with the youtubers Sam and colby
You are good and brave I might be a 911 dispatcher when I turn 18
Never Fails To Entertain.

We play Call of Duty Online, Michelle plays Call of Duty in Real Life! 👌🏿
Omg yess this is one of the best episodes she has ever posters omg please make more much love ❤️
Is the 911 operator watching?? 🤔🤔
her videos are so educational
That's extreme dude
YES IVE WAITED AGES FOR THIS VID I CHECKED EVERY DAY TO SEE IF YA POSTED AND HERE IT ISSS YAAAAAA
You did so good! What a cool experience. =)
Omg FINALLY THE SWAT VIDEO I WAITED SO LONG UR THE BEST MICHELLE I watch ur videos and urs only
Woahhhh
Thank you for showing what these rescuers go through. I love these challenges. It helps with transparency so people understand what training and pressure our law enforcement (or even beach lifeguards) are under
Michelle can you try being a zoo keeper
As a disabled athlete, I'd love to see you try some paralympic sports. I think having a woman like you get on a goalball court, or on a blind soccer pitch, or play wheelchair basketball/rugby would be amazing, and really beneficial to the sports. We need the publicity, and you could do a lot to help with that. Plus, you'd have a blast.
Try coast guard  rescue swimmer
E
Michelle, I have a huge girl crush on you
Plz do more of Challenge accepted
Finally a new vidio
Hi
Do you have a series on Netflix or Hulu or something?  Your so exiting!💓
i was just thinking of this video
Hello I’m so impressed your so cool I want to be a firefighter when I grow up and u can just pop out here and say I was a firefighter a cop a marine and a ems person that’s so FRICKIN COOL can you please do de navy seals next
Hey michelle Can you try the Air Force pls
The amount of times I got chills throughout this video is insane. I love this inside look, which humanizes these jobs while being respectful and honoring their daily lives. Huge kudos to you Michelle, you are so strong, and bring humor and education in an enjoyable way.
It would be so awesome if you did a video on 'I trained military dogs'! Could be tracking, detection, bitework, etc.
would love to see you try to be a drag queen and lead up to a show in a club :)))
Hey
Yes, finally I have been waiting ever since the teasers!
You should do fpv drones next I’m pretty sure it’s harder
Michelle is the definition of a bad ass !!💪
hi love your videos
A have been waiting for so long! I love your videos!
I wanted to take out the time to say I appreciate all these challenge videos you do.
Why is there a max time for the obstacle course? What if you finish it within 3 minutes?
a
The moment we have been waiting for!
You should try being the president
i nominate trying WGI or DCI
Michelle, you are so inspirational!!! Your smile is contagious. I discovered your channel by chance. In my freetime, I am binge watching all your videos. Your determination is out of this world. I love all your videos. Thank you for motivating me. All challenges in life are worth the endurance, pain  and sweat. Big hug
You Should do K9 training next!
Such an inspirational woman!
you should do a training for a security guard for someone important, like a president. They have trainings for that so they simulate the shooting and stuff, I would watch that one for sure.
I WAIT THIS FROM YEEEE
Great production value!!!!
7:20 this guys voice is soothing
I don’t know why but your so entertaining making these types of videos
Any advice of trying the SWAT👨‍🎓
IVE BEEN SO EXITED FOR THIS VIDEOOO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
dang you brave
She’s now my favorite YouTuber
Me seeing this video : YES LETS GOOOOOO
This needs to be a series on Discovery.
I love the fact that she tried the Police academy first then SWAT
You are an inspiration to young girls everywhere. Can’t wait for your next challenge. The 911 Dispatcher challenge remains my favorite.
First
so cool omg i wish i was on that movie set
yes sir
Can you please do a c.I.a vid
14:53 “hands down”
disappointed in this video .. this was trash
You should try soccer
Michelle, you're just simply badass! When will the movie come out?😀😀
Maximum? You're not allowed to be too good? 🤔
you get a dislike for calling real life a game
Danggggg!!!
Try beeing a Cirque du Soleil performer
Next Challenge: Training to shoot like John Wick.. 🙈
You should train like a pro lacrosse player I recommend Boston college
Most epic challenge ever!  Great job!

Michelle,I love your channel,you're truly inspiring !!! LOL.LOVE how you come out your comfort zone and are willing/able to try something new.I see an upcoming video about trying the U.S.Army,I saw your video of the Marines basic training,it was good.You did well with the marines,you'll do well with the army.I did 7yrs in the army,had sooo much fun,miss the fun I had,civilian sector is sooo boring.Look forward to more videos from you.  SEMPER-FI.
YES ITS OUT
Is this the San Diego Police Department??
Amazing. Swat is one of the best ones I've watched. They're serious about what they do but obviously also enjoy their jobs. They are clearly intelligent and know what they're doing. Was an amazing episode.
Michelle! I just wanna say how incredibly proud I am of you with how far you've come combating your fear of heights!! I remember when what you did with the windows would have left you completely frozen, and here you were actually ENJOYING yourself!!
God i love your videos!!!
Thank you Michelle! I have been waiting for this, you are so strong! I would quit the moment if I tried to do these videos, thank you Michelle for great content!
Les goo
I was watching another video and saw this. I said "Hey! I'll watch that next!" Buuuuuut....... I got about 30 seconds into my other video, and well.. here I am :D
Michelle, having tried all these different things, if you WERENT a YTber, what profession would you enter?
Happy you visited my hometown San digo
Try rubix cube or jet skis or lifeguard? Maybe and btw i love your videos maybe you could do a video of a chef?
I love these
this was EPIC
Omg I was waiting for itttt 😊
I would be mentally ill and stressed after all these videos. It requires a great amount of courage and strength to even "try" these. Imagine those doing these jobs everyday,every hour.
Wow amazing
I was actually asking myself when will Michelle make his video, here it is
A flash bang is a explosive used for causing a suspect to experience confusion of a flash and smoke. When it detonates it causes a unexpected timing flash witch can make the suspect blind for a couple of seconds or zone out
this is still one of the best series on youtube
why is this hot?
Ok
challenge idea idk if this a good one or not idk if they train diffrent but train like k9 officers
Mk have you tried professional bowling I wanna see you try that
michelle is soo cool lol
Michelle!!!! Just when I didn’t think you could get more bad ASS!!!! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 you’re so amazing!
payday 2 flashbacks
Yessir
One of the first officers have voice like one of the officer from SWAT4 game :). Very cool video!
💙🇬🇭👮
this was such a good episode i was litch waiting for you to post this after you mentioning doing this in you're last vid Michelle have you ever thought about doing airsoft or speed QB airsoft ??
I have an idea of a video you can do. It's about taking art lessons and seeing if you can sell a painting in a art gallery or seeing people guess how much the painting would be worth. would be cool to see! :)
very fun episode!
Suffering from multiple hip and knee injuries, I look at you in awe and how you overcome these. Love you so much. Such an inspiration.
13:57 I just imagined the swat theme song rhythm heritage
Hey S.Stinnette i am building a house and i would like you to be the architect as i seen how skilled you are at drawing a room lol.....
You should do I Tried navy Seal training
Very cool video!!!
You should try training like a competitive jumproper and then enter a competition.

favorite episode ever
Let’s go! I’ve been so exited! I’m on my to baseball and I saw this I’m like LETS GO!
Michelle amazing video keep up the work
she's trying to collect the infinity stones of trying different jobs
Fun fact: Michelle makes it like the swat training is easy and u can make jokes there but that's the opposite of the swat serves in training
You did a basic fire academy, do a wildland fire academy with cal fire!
LETS GOOOO
Wow this was like watching a movie. Good job Michelle. Its always crazy to see how you master every challenge. You are a beast  Thanks for creating such great content💚
yessir
I’m sure a lot of people have already said this before but she reminds me of barbie when shes like “this is from the time i was a doctor, this is when i was a pilot, this is when i went into space”
YAYAYAY IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS
Omg this is so amazing I can’t wait to see I tried the U.S. army becuase my dads in the army
lol I just watched your video of your calling 911
SWAT is awesome! This video of LAPD SWAT is so cool. https://youtu.be/h75DxgPPhSE
ON GOLLY?
Bruh, that's me lol. I do everything else correctly until.... the pull ups... 🤣
Amazing video! If you want to try something less explosive, try professional ping pong!
Michelle can you go to pilot academy
You should try being a teacher..
Woah this video is so cool. Your super tough and strong!!
One if the best episodes yet. Michelle and SDPD did an amazing job! Seeing the progression and actually feeling the hardships and disappointment of ones learning curve was surreal.
Hello
YAY i was waiting for a lonnnnggg time
Glad to see this!!
oh im SO excited for the US Army episode
Michelle, I have no words for this video. The level of determination and courage is indescribable. I am so proud of you!
Hi!
i have been waiting for this…
This was the best one❗
swat are coolz
Honestly I want to be Michelle when I grow up
I like how Michelle shows she didn't pass and that not everyone gets it the first time it makes me see her as human! <3
Your so brave
Do one that you are a k9 officer
She needs to go play airsoft in a Milsim game. Would make for some fun footage
now try flight school
MICHELLE IS REAL-LIFE BARBIE ✨✨
Op Reggie umm t  Im P lol lol
I literally love your videos sm. I watched every single of your vids no cap<3
Can u try to do the got talent be Judge
Finally, love u michelle
Michelle is one of the most outgoing and adventurous people ever. I’m always amazed by her
just wow!
This is my dream job and now I'm prepared what to do when I'm in a academy to be on the SWAT team thank you so much
BEST VIDEO THIS WAS 😍 Keep it up also if you can't handle these videos you could stop at anytime I don't mind
Just found this channel and I subscribed because she’s doing so much like trying so many things and it’s also kinda inspirational. I kinda wish I had found this channel earlier because it is so entertaining but now I’m here and will remain for the time being. Keep up the good work Michelle, and hope everyone reading my comment has a good day evening or night.
You are one of my number one favorite YouTubers! You’re super inspiring and you prove that challenge and hardship is merely an obstacle. Way to go!
Can’t lie this obstacle course looks easy
Cool vi
WOW
This is incredible! Congrats to you and the whole crew 🙌🏼
I LOVEEE THESE VIDEOS!!! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK! 💛 🖤
great video , but usually she's more serious in this kind of videos
omg
Not so serious this time as the other challenges ;(
This video was nuts!
Nothing in the nature lives for itself. Rivers don’t drink their own water. Trees don’t eat their own fruit. Sun doesn’t give heat for itself. Flowers don’t spread fragrances for themselves... living for others is the rule of nature. You already know the answer you seek. Trust what you know.
ITS HERE!
You are beast i would have passed out half way thru the course
I haven’t even watched it yet but I know it’s gon be fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Everyone is scared of swat. Why is that? Is the fear something they deserve? Are they evil?
SHES A REAL LIFE BARBIE 😍😍😍
What happaned with the like butten?
I'm not sure if I'm noticing an error?  I noticed in the 1:00-2:00 time frame, the stats list minimum # and maximum # For example, Michelle ran the sprint in 77 seconds. 85 seconds was the cap, meaning the range was 55-85 seconds. Yet the maximum shows 55 and the minimum as 85... Shouldn't those be the other way around? Same with all the numbers displayed... Pullups needed at least 6, but 6 was listed as the maximum # (shouldn't it be the minimum required?)  Is it possible to update a video file without removing the entire video? (I'm commenting this within the first hour of the upload. Hoping if this is an error, it's something the team can fix. Of course it isn't a huge deal,  only something I noticed as a viewer which confused me)
I’ve been waiting for this. It’s my dream job.
Watching this while playing rainbow six siege 😂
Do CIA AGENT
You are a Badass 🤙🏽🤙🏽
Loved your discourse with the sniper as he described suspect:"He's not a danger to anyone. He's just a barricaded suspect." Had a similar situation with a suspect. He had fired 100 plus rounds at officers. When the suspect realized I had a bead on him he surrendered. The whole time, cops with me were shouting "Shoot him. Shoot him." Street cops sometimes don't realize the rules snipers have to follow. Suspect was arrested (not shot).
Love the videos keep it up
Hey Michelle new challenge try professional sniper training👍
I would love to see you train as a bodyguard/executive protection officer!
Just noticed, you got a new pfp! It's so good mate!
trie horse racing
Imagine there is a swat  call during her training.
Super cool! What an intense experience.  They are badass!
OMG UR THE BEST YOUTUBE EVER U DO CHALLENGES A MAN CANT EVEN DO (No offense) UR TRULLY AWESOME
Worth the wait
This is just SICK! Good job!
I love all of your video and in this swat team video you nill it I really like it
Wow this is so impressive
Michelle: 😂 “Good Morning!” 💁🏽‍♀️ 🧨💥  Bad Guys: 👁👄👁
why no 4k? :(
I won’t miss your upcoming videos because I love you challenge accepted videos
I usually skip these parts
cool
You should try Aerial Silks i think you would have alot of fun and i think you would be good at is
Yay! Sooo cool. To think you can just walk into that and succeed is foolish. You did so well! Also. This is all that ever matters. GIVE IT YOUR ALL! Which you always do! Be proud! 👊
From Africa kenya and tuned in like always
I KNEW IT YAY!
Love your videos! They are so inspiring to be whoever you want to be!
Can you do military police next time
Good job
I just recently found this channel, I have been bingeing the content. You’re such a motivational Michelle
That was amazing. Thank u swat team for your service.
Honestly you are badass for taking on these challenges, remember most people have much longer to train, and get used to the new job or environmental as they are trained in stuff like this, you do it much faster and the emotions you must experience in all this high speed high level environment speed is no joke. Just saying even when you don’t make it, remember don’t compare yourself to the trained expert when you’re a novice. Watching you go through all this in the video all i could think was i want to roll into a ball of anxiety and hide in a safe corner, doing something like this ain’t easy, dont put yourself down when most people wouldn’t even dare try the challenges that you put yourself through.   You’re an inspiration for women everywhere Michelle and the awareness you share for the work field you experience through your challenges gives me a new appreciation for the work they do on a daily basis, a lot of which is often taken for granted when we ourself don’t see it with our own eyes. So thank you on so many levels Michelle and team❤️🥰
I like that you show us your failures and repeated attempts to get better at something. Shows it takes practice and dedication to get something right.
Been waiting for a new challenge accepted
Insane video! I loved it
michelle tries becoming president?!
You mean rainbow six siege 😂 that when I used to play it was fun I mess the og days of that game
YAY
Oh hell yeah lol

Why is Michelle so cool?
Wow finally an 3p where she doesn't cry like a baby

Shit was intense
There should be a special edition doll of you. I can’t imagine how many kids you’re inspiring!
This is so cool!!!!!!!!
Try pilot accademy!
THANK YOU SOOOOOO MUCH
dream job
This was so worth the wait!!!
Next video idea: I tried Khan Academy
I just finished watching the tv show S.W.A.T.  So this really opened my eyes how much effort actually goes into being a SWAT academy. Thanks Michelle 💗✨
Let's goooooo! I've been waiting for this one, and after seeing the pic of you at the US Army's Basic Airborne Course at Fort Benning I'm definitely looking forward to seeing that episode as well!
благодаря этому ролику я научился играть мануальный спецназ 114 лапд, обожаю лапдшечку и всё что с ней связано. я сампюк
I never hear anyone talk about the McDonald’s massacre. Truly one of the saddest things to happen, feel sorry for those first responders and victims😔
Been waiting for so long for this! haven't finished but I can tell it will be amazing! thank you and keep up the amazing work!
Can you do spec ops please
This was worth the wait, good job Michelle
The repel is a lot different then the marine corps.  They just kinda, push you……….and your on the ground
I was waiting for this from when you uploaded the police video
At 9.35 to 9.42... Suuuuper cute!!🥰🥰😍
Amazing video!
I was about to ask you to try swat lol
I aggree
I will keep saying this. MICHELLE Khare is so underrated and underappreciated! Every video should have at the very least 10M views!
My toxic trait is thinking I could do this      (I can't )
Miss these videos so much!!!!
Challenge Accepted videos >>>>>
Ay girl give me a hi am aI right?
FAV SERIES
Amazing!  Don't know why but I started crying from watching your progression thru each stage of your training.  Towards the end, I was visibly panting from the perceived danger.  As a father, I imagined my daughter trying this... I was so proud of you and the fact you continued thru all the training even after failing the fitness part.  Great video storytelling!
Hi! Michelle I watched A lot of your video of all the thing you try to do and it so Inspiring to other when you do them and so people see how hard people work and how much dedication it takes to do them! Can’t Wait to see what you try next!
Michelle Khare on a SWAT Team: *busts door down* "I hear you have not been sticking to your self care routine. I am here to rectify that. Do not resist"
Wow this is the best video ever Michelle keep up the good work 👍🏻
🦧
Hey you are to amazing I wish I was you
I love Challenge Accepted. It reminds me of like Anthony's interviews. It helps us learn more about these occupations. Especially when all we know is the fantastical versions in tv and film.
Do pilot
finally! its here!!
Even though she didn't pass the first time she tried, that was still better than most of us would do
damn
🔥🔥🔥
wow
Wow
Next: I trained as Baki for 1 year
Hey :)

Some of the best content on youtube.

That looks like so much fun, I’ve always wanted to become a sniper just didn’t know how too and this looks so cool AHAHAHAHA
My social anxiety could never let me do this😭💀
Daaam Michelle, your a powerhouse! Friggin unstoppable. Love the videos, keep em coming :)
I love that I recognized one of those scenes from the movies as Captain America: Civil War, when they’re tracking Bucky
5:27 would get you kicked out of SWAT Academy INSTANTLY... You're pretty much aiming at his head, if you shot accidentally you killed a team mate
The production quality in these videos is top notch. Hats off to the editor/production team.
Love ur vids your such a brave girl and you make other ladies brave and strong and confident so they can do whatever men can
You should do something with hypnosis would be really cool
I believe this is the most underrated channel on youtube. I discovered your channel during the pogchamps event and been a fan of your videos since then. Michelle, You are so brave, persistent, honest, funny and open minded. You are amazing!
Michelle always saying "girl" in every situation will always be hilarious! 😆🤣
Girl I waited so long for this

ive been waiting to see this ever sense i saw your channel so im so glad you did SWAT academy
Michelle is like a real life barbie with all the life experiences she has achieved

Gosh I love how during the obstacle course everyone was so supportive and instructive. You're amazing and so strong!   I would love to see you try color guard/winter guard it's such a cool sport and not talked about enough.
I been waiting to see this!!
ah yes let the dog be the bait
THIS WAS SUCH A AWSOME VIDEO, I ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW WHAT AN SWAT IS EXPERIENCING IN A SCENARIO, AT IT WAS SO COOL! MICHELLE, YOUR SUCH A BRAVE AND CONFIDENT LEGEND!

Another great video. It always fascinates me how quickly you learn to do difficult dangerous tasks so well under extreme pressure in such a short amount of time. You're my favorite super hero.
Cool
Girl that obstacle course looked like hell😱 well done for even finishing that thing😖😱 Then the rest of the video follows and i’m just left speechless 😱  Conclusion: I should work out more, a lot more, specially arms cause those pull-ups are evil

I don’t know how she does that I could never
It’s so amazing to see how many opportunities you get and that you get to really see what it’s like for many difficult jobs!
i always wanted to be a swat
WOW YOUR SO COOL!!
It’s kinda weird I just watched her 911 video 2 hours ago and was like oh it will be out soon not this soon!
This gave me an idea.... Try Special-Ops training
Can you please try Department Of Homeland Security?  Like, so she can see it.
We gotta appreciate her, i mean like she be doing exhausting challenges like this while we are chilling in our home, eating chips and stuff while she be doing this, amazing Michelle great job, thanks for doing these exhausting challenges for us!
Hi, I’m new to this channel but your content is something very unique and entertaining to watch! I was wondering if you haven’t already, you could try training to be a zookeeper? I used to volunteer at my local zoo and I have to say that it’s a great experience learning about how to care for all the animals we had and teaching others about them whenever they walked through the area I was stationed in. Working with the animals was a very fun experience and the only reason I quit where I had worked was because I realized it wasn’t what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, but I don’t regret it one bit.
Michelle seems like she has many mental issues and phobias she needs to take care of
thanks so much
great video your so brave
YES FINALLY
YES FINALLY
*Uses door knocker to bust your door in, then..* "Good morniiiiiiiiiiing!" xD

knowing the truth about Michelle broke my heart and made me cry, poor ex BF it all started when I went to maun.Lol this break me hurt  True determination, this just shows the true powers of bare humans, no training what-so ever. Just put your mind to it. And do it.

Permission to post? I know it's not related but I want to share this message to anyone who have the ears to listen  Then Jesus told him, "Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those  who have not seen and have believed."                                            John 20:29  God bless ~

Jesus loves you and wants to begin a relationship with you irrespective of your past. John 3:16. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life. All you need do is say. Lord Jesus please forgive me where i have sinned against you in my thoughts actions words and deeds. Please cleanse me and wash me with your precious blood and come into my life in Jesus Name. Amen.Hurray you are now a child of God. Just as a little baby needs milk to grow so do you need the word of God.God bless you as you start your new walk with Jesus. Ask the holyspirit to led you to a church where you can be fed continuously with the word of God.
Finally!

Johnny Sins doesn't have shit on Michelle Khare. She can answer the 911 call, and dispatch herself as a SWAT operator.
12507th!
Image can do anything if she puts her mind on it
17:12 I died laughing with the way she said no
Yes let go!

Hdhehd
Wow. Really well done episode!

We love you Michelle!!!
The thing you mass-shootings (or shooting all together) proves, is that you need to get your gun control in order.. Ban them.
Heyyy
POV 0:40 Your teacher sending homework
This is amazing! I feel like you inspire SO many people in choosing their careers, not only do you do this by yourself but you inspire others in what this is like, you're amazing Michelle, thanks❤
Finally girl I was waiting

WAS WAITING FOR DIS
W.O.W I love your series!! Pls like my comment😍😍
you might’ve struggled but you are strong and got through it and didn’t give up that’s what makes you better
I'd like to Michelle 3 sports challenge 1. Cricket Match 2. Powerlifting 3. Soccer game

Her energy and enthusiasm is so viral i love it!
Next is learning how to run for President.
Michelle the will power u obtain I could never have I pray that when I'm older I can have the courage that u have to push through 💞💞💞
You should try professional wrestling you can tryout at the performance center in Orlando florida
Amazing epsidoe!
Its been 28 mins since this video has been released and so many peoplr already saw it. Its crazy :D
It's so cool, to be able to experience all these academies and meet different people you can learn from.  Can't wait to watch your upcoming videos Michelle! I love them #challengeexcepted !
i was waiting so long for this vid!!!!!!!!!!!!
ur so incredible
26 minutes
I love these Series keep it Up :)
with the amount of training you have - your acting portfolio must be huge  It'd be wild if you found a future career in one of these videos
I love this vid ⭐️❤️
Woah! Can we all just appreciate how much time and effort Michelle puts into each and every video!? This was so entertaining to watch! Love your vids!
My favorite channel omggggg
Don’t mess with Michelle, she done police, swat, and FBI.
Yessssss
Next video .. i went to jail !
I clicked on one of these and could not stop watching
hi Michell can you do an episode about being  a Canadian youth cadet I am one and I think it would be cool

Claim your here before 1 hour ticket here
Slow is smooth smooth is fast.
Michelle!! Your videos inspire me so much to take better care of myself and help me achieve things!! <3<3 Thank you so much!! <3
Wow so brave
this was so stressful but so entertaining and interesting as usual
After all these challenges she can be the final boss in a video game
Good job
FINNALY THIS HAS BEEN LONG WAITED BY ME
YAYYY ANOTHER MICHELLE VIDEO
You should do a video testing all the training you have done over the years
She is taking on challenges that at least 80% of us may fear
After all these, military, law enforcement and  dispatcher roles you've attempted: do you have a different appreciation or sustain for what these people go through? Like has your opinion of what is portrayed in the news: has it changed or strengthen?
433rd
Yes, finally. Let's gooo!
This is my dream I love roleplay also I love swat
That was sick
slayed
yes finally
We knew u we’re gonna do this from the 911 video

Omg im earlier to this vid yey l love ur vids
If I was on this I think I’d by accidently shoot the camera man 👀
Crazy!
That obstacle course looked fun but tough all in one. Yeah Call of Duty is easier in game form unless your shooting sucks, but the final challenges are always intense.
Yesss We lovee challenge accepted videos 💝  Also love the new pfp!
I've wanted to see this for a long time.

Hello
It just amazes me every time you try something new bc not most people are capable of doing it. All the hard work and dedication you put to the series is out of this world. As a woman, I really look up to you and admire everything you do bc I feel women don’t get enough recognition. SWAT has always been super interesting to me so thank you for letting us experience a piece of what it actually takes to be part of the SWAT team!
Michelle you never fail to amaze me! Trying out everything definitely seems like a dream to me SO insane
We all wish we could do so many things like this, but at the same time we like the safety of our room XD
Finally!
