This man really put his phone number in the song 😂😂😂😂😂
I heard this boogie verse like 3 years ago, glad he finally had dropped it 👌🏼
This is his verse from the actual remix
1:16
Think anyone tried ringing his number
I just wish boogie verse was longer 😭 this shit a banger
Ah, ah, ha-ha (She's a runner, runner, runner, runner, runner) This the remix, yeah-yeah (Oh, oh, oh, oh) Shawty gon' run when she in a bind A track star, we never seen the finish line Can't confide or commit, she scared to trust somebody On your mark, go, set, go, she 'bout to dust somebody Do what it take, do what's gon' make it last She can't take the pain that come with that Hit the brakes 'fore it's too late, she fast Once she set her pace, she don't look back Now I know I looked over the signs Girl, do you ever get tired (you know) of runnin', runnin'? Oh, why? She's a runner, she's a track star She gon' run away when it gets hard She can't take the pain, she can't get scarred She hurt anyone that gets involved Don't wanna commit, why take it this far? (Oh, why?) She gon' do the race, just not this one (oh, why?) Love is a game, you used to cheer for (no, oh-oh, woah) When I was down to talk, you weren't here for it (ooh, woah, oh, oh) She's a liar, she a capper She'd do anything for the Black Card She give you her pain with a black heart (no) Should of never let that shit get that far (woah, woah) It's always been games with you (oh) Keepin' score and changin' moods (oh) I was all for it, but lately you (oh) Showed me that side, that crazy you (oh, crazy you) And you can get to packin' all of your bags You can leave the racks with all of them tags Gon' do your thing and don't look back Damn, girl, you fast (woah, woah) She's a runner, she's a track star (oh, she, she) She gon' run away when it gets hard (away, yeah) She can't take the pain, she can't get scarred (no, oh-oh, woah) She hurt anyone that gets involved (ah, yeah, oh-oh, babe) Don't wanna commit, why take it this far? (Oh, why? Oh, why?) She gon' do the race, just not this one (oh, why? Oh, why?) Love is a game, you used to cheer for (woah) When I was down to talk, you weren't here for it I said don't you run from me (don't you run) Don't take my love for granted 'cause you know it can get ugly She's a runner, she's a track star (oh-oh) Don't run away when it get hard, love I can tell that, you ain't ever had a gangster I'm aware of that, he ain't never tell you, "Thank ya" How you wear that, you should get a new Wraith, oh-oh (skrrt) I'm slidin' when you tell me it's convenient ('venient) You know I got the Glock up in 'Ghini Grant a couple wishes like a genie She gon' keep up runnin' back if she got access Got my dick hard like it's hard to be a Black man I cut her off and put my feelings in the trash can (ooh-ooh-ooh) I guess all this love was just too much love for you She's a runner, she's a track star She gon' run away when it gets hard She can't take the pain, she can't get scarred She hurt anyone that gets involved Don't wanna commit, why take it this far? (Oh, why?) She gon' do the race, just not this one (oh, why?) Love is a game, you used to cheer for (na-na) When I was down to talk, you weren't here for it (na-na, na-na) You-ouu-ouu-ouu-ouu (ooh, ooh, ooh) Baby, stop frontin' (stop) Grab on your waist, that's gon' make you stop runnin' (stop runnin') Diamonds on my chain and watch bustin' You look at me like you want somethin' Don't keep it low, keep it one-hundred Speakin' of numbers, I Here, I gave you the wrong one on purpose But this one is workin' fine Hit my line, call me whenever you want some me 646-992-7453 I'm from the jungle, but I'm not a cheater Bitch, I'm in my bag now, it's Hoodie SZN I'ma set it off if a nigga creep up And she gon' take the charge like it's a misdemeanor I was mad high, you was off a Xan', I know I was tryna fuck you and your friends like (oh) Even though that wasn't in the plans right (no) Drum with a stick, like a band, I know (woo) AP on my wrist, that's a bustdown, oh-woah King of this fly shit, yeah, I know You can hold me down and be more than my hoe Stop actin' like you love me when you really don't know She's a runner, she's a track star
I made this song inspired with a boogies types of beats and it sounds spot on , I’m from the bronx just as he is I’d appreciate if you guys checked it out supported it enough so hopefully a boogie himself could see it. Much love and thank you   Song Link: https://youtu.be/TOOr9Uj7CgY  🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽

10 of the World's Funniest One Liners  1. I went to the fights, and a hockey game broke out. 2. The last thing on earth you want to do will be the last thing you do. 3. We are born naked, wet and hungry. Then things get worse.  4. 42.7 percent of all statistics are made up on the spot.  5. I just let my mind wander, and it didn't come back. 6. Don't steal. The government hates competition. 7. Humpty Dumpty was pushed. 8. National Atheist's Day April 1st.  9. My mind is like a steel trap, rusty and illegal in 37 states. 10. Nothing is fool proof to a sufficiently talented fool.      Editorial: Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right.  Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you  will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if  that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)?  Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed  adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you  have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are  a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three  of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be  innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in  Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven.  He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward  us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then  rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to  all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ.  Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21  for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you  read. God will never let you down.Visit NeedGod.com.
I know you love Ella

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do these things, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife  .   You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make.   Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 )  ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’  .

John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9- That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10- For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!

AHHHHHHHH HOODIE FUCKING SZZZN YURRRR
Will the Messiah really eliminate all evil?  ′′ You loved justice and you hate wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with oil of celebration more than your companions ′′ (Psalm 45:7 [45:8, BE])  Those who rule have the responsibility to uphold the law. The Messiah, as King of God's government, will undoubtedly act in this respect. ′′ A little longer, and the wicked shall no longer be; and you shall certainly pay attention to his place, and he shall not be. But the tame selves will possess the earth, and in reality they will try exquisite delight in the abundance of peace ′′ (Psalm 37:10, 11).  What kind of change can we expect?  God will fully fulfill his promise to create ′′ new heavens ", a just government that will administer a ′′ new land ′′ (Isaiah 65:17). The Messiah government will give blessings not only to the land of Israel, but to ′′ all nations ", just as Jehovah promised Abraham (Isaiah 2:2, 3; Genesis 22:18). The Kingdom of God governed by the Messiah will provide a definitive and universal answer to the challenge thrown to the name and in God's purpose.  What do you mean life then will be different from the current one?  Human race will see the long awaited fulfillment of God's promise through Isaiah: ′′ He will certainly make judgement between the nations and make things right compared to many peoples. And they'll have to make their swords plow swords and spears to prun. Nation will not raise the sword against nation, nor will they learn the war anymore ". The prophecy continues: ′′ They will not damage nor cause ruin throughout my holy mountain; for the earth will certainly be filled with Jehovah's knowledge as the waters cover the same sea ′′ (Isaiah 2:4; 11:9).  How do we know this will become reality?  These promises are part of the unchanging purpose of the Almighty God, Jehovah, who is God ′′ in the heavens above and on the earth below ′′ (Joshua 2:11). Jehovah himself tells us: ′′ Remember the first things of a long time ago, that I I am the Divine and there is no other God, nor any like me; He who announces the term from the beginning, and from a long time ago the things that have not been done; He who says: ' My own counsel will take effect, and I will do whatever is my delight ' ′′ (Isaiah 46:9, 10). Jehovah said he will fulfill his purpose through the Messiah. Who on earth could stop him? If you would like more information visit the official website of Jehovah’s Witnesses at www.jw.org

Yahushuah (Jesus)... Man, isn't he great? He can truly work miracles. He has in my life and many others who've accepted him as Savior, he truly saved me from the dark path of a non fulfilling sinful life. All I had to do was drop to my knees and ask for forgiveness and repent from my sins. Now I come here to spread the message of the Gospel to those with an open heart and an open mind.  Examine yourself as you read this. How do you feel? How you feel will tell about your heart... If it's anger, you're heart has been hardened. Some people will reply to this comment saying "he's not real", "sky daddy", and many other mocking things. Ask, why do you feel the need to even give attention to someone who is claiming "nonsense" or something that isn't real? Do you fear that others will hear and accept it..? What force is driving you to fear the words of Elohim (God)...? The words of the Gospel are words of love, what force is forcing you to hate and try to distract and take people away from the words of love?  Now isn't the time to continue playing with the time Elohim has given us. I've fallen into the trap of following my flesh and following this world instead of walking in the spirit and following Yahushuah. The trap of habitual sin, just like most people are in right now. I'm just like you, a sinner. But I'm here to tell you, there's a different way, a way of actual fulfillment. This world is passing away and the things of it will pass away with it. What good is it to stay attached to it?  There will come a time when every knee will bow and every tongue shall confess that Yahushuah is Lord... Before that, will be great tribulation in this world. The birthing pains have already started. If you're not prepared spiritually, you stand no chance. The beast system will eat you up... The birth of a New World Order is coming and those with eyes to see and ears to hear know this is biblical.  Do not deny Yahushuah or the Ruach Hakodesh (Holy Spirit). Do not deny Elohim.  May Elohim bless those who are open minded and hearted enough to receive this message and take it to Elohim in prayer. Amen.

“Ayy, ayy She’s a runner, she’s a track star She gon’ run away when it gets hard She can’t take the pain, she can’t get scarred She hurt anyone that gets involved”  Almost 100% relatable! Except I don’t intentionally hurt those involved...  The song is lit! I am going to keep it on repeat for a while today. Keep putting out amazing music!
