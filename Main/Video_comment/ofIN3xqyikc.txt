Mary J is the New Ghost she’s playing her part very good
•Damn that Attorney Tameka was on Tasha Ass "It's not Business it's Personal"  •Saks Plays a Missin Puzzle piece he's Tasha Get Outta Jail Card  •Tariq Needs that Connect w Monae That Lil Gwaup have he soon Die
This new season fire bro
Anybody got any free apps to watch this episode
This ain’t really a spin off it’s basically another series lol
They'd have been better off giving the Monet role to someone like Taraji...I'm not feeling the danger associated to her character in MJB..Idk,maybe I'm buggin
i'd strap a pair of handlebars on monet, and ride that till the wheels fall off
yall can watch this on Soap2day for free every sunday.
Lorenzo Tejada definitely knows who Ghost and Tommy are. And once he finds out Tariq is Ghost’s kid running around with his family... he gonna be looking to kill him.
How do I watch it?
Well, that didn't tell us shit
Damn 50 got Mary J Blige to be the ultimate Gangsta Never new she worked with Suge and Puffy I'm glad The Queen is getting her Respect put some Respect on the Queen's Name
A lot of people hate Tariq but I like him and tbh it’s his parents fault his life is messed up . His dad never really spent time to look after and take the role as a father and his mom just gave him everything not making him work for shit, plus I personally think it wasn’t his fault his sister died she shouldn’t have went up to a gangster.
I must say. I had doubts about this new power series with ghost and Tommy  , but am not gone lie, shit is going good so far. Hats off to 50 and courtney
NOT GONNA WATCH IT
lucky there aren't many other shows to watch, i hope ghost comes back, tariq is the worst actor i hate him
Method man 👍🏾 on that role & acting skills
TRASH
Yooo !!!!
They did a amazing job , with the new characters .
If Tasha wouldn't have set her boyfriend for the murder nobody would be charged if everybody kept quiet. Tariq got rid of the clothing he shot Ghost in and he had an aliby of where he was at. That's the only evidence they have.
Can’t waitttttttt !!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can't waitttt
Why is that professor so interested in helping Tariq?
I do not owe anyone anything now because of, *p  a  i  d t o b e h o m e .c o m*
tommy needs to come back
I won't believe ghost is dead until I see a dead body
Someone finna die this episode
Can we get ghost back
I didn't bother to watch Power the first one because someone said it was like Empire and I watched two episodes of that turned it off and never looked back. I got curious with Book 2 and I got to say I'm intrigued. Everyone is trying to hide something and watching them squirm under pressure just a little is so nice to see.
Mary J cant act lol. She’s trash
Heaven and earth will pass away Jesus said, but my Words 📖 will never pass away. Matthew 24:35  There will be a new heaven and a new earth. Revelations 21:1  We must be willing to turn from sin to receive Jesus forgiveness , and to know and live out his teachings. He who does the will of God abides for eternity 1 John 2:17. Visual Bible movies 🎥. And Audio Bible NKJV on YouTube ❤️📖🇺🇸
I thought this was going to be a supernatural show but it turned out to be a crime drama. Bad yt algorithm.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates🎈Non-Duality
Tommy & Tariq have something in common, they both killed their fathers. Js
Mary J. Blige 😍
If you are reading this comment:  💕BE BLESSED!!!   x1,000,000💕✨❤️💕💫
ONLY People who didn’t come from *tiKtoK* are worthy of liking this
Jacob Warner need to be in the mix and put him on the stand to expose Cooper Saxe for being dirty. Blanca Rodriguez should help him do it and arrange for him to be on the stand
Still no RIP post for Ghost
Will this be on Netflix in uk anyone know?
https://youtu.be/EK0xnXgpX9g soundtrack for power
Why everyone is saying they don't like tariq, he is the reason why i watch power
People crying about Mary J looking mad and what not. What reason does she have to be happy lol. Her character is in a terrible position.
Am i the only one who still thinks Ghost is alive And body not shown in the coffin
Acting and story been kinda corny and super unrealistic
Method is killing his role as a lawyer👏👏👏....he really stepped out his comfort zone and convinced me his an attorney........and I have to mention those eyes 😍 been luvin them since the 90s 💋
If you believe in the future then you will know that indeed Bitcoin is the future
Can’t wait for that conversation between Tariq and Monet when he tries to get a deal with her
am i the only one who think diana fine asf??
I'm just waiting for ghost to come back😂😂😂
Ghost is on witness protection they faked his death to protect him, it worked out perfectly because of the Democratic party remember they have power to do these things expect ghost to come back and I'm sure he's going to have to get tyreke out of trouble again Tommey also knows ghost is still alive
It's no way he dead closed casket for getting shot in the chest hmm I doubt ghost dead
I love that the title of the episode is play the game same thing that kanan said to Tariq 💯💯
I mostly watching this seeing Method Man and Mary J Blige in action, and they are great in their roles.
Tasha been sloppy these last two/ three seasons. She haven’t been thinking straight
Mary J acting skills suck
The writers dont miss another masterpiece incoming......
So... ya’ll think Tariq gone buss Lauren’s cheeks, Diana’s cheeks or both??
Mary cant act. I said that shit. Her expression is the same in every scene. Maybe this character isint a fit for her. Monet isint working for me.
Young boy doing amazing acting
Tariq start a organization in NY and Tommy in LA. I feel like we will something between this to shows. Tommy vs Tariq
Jumping ahead here but tommy kills riq when power book II ends, I’ll revisit this comment in a few years.
That guy kane is scary
Ghost is alive. He  ain't dead..we could've seen his body during the burial
Why is the show centered around Mary J and her bad azz kids...What am I missing here? 🤔
A graveside funeral....Never seen him in the casket...That's why his name is Ghost...he is not dead...Like he said....He always win...
How tf old dude  get out if he had 38 years
honestly, i miss ghost but the show aint as bad as i expected it to be.
I hope Saxe career is over. It was stupid of him to involve Blanca. So funny he wants to put the “bad guys” away, yet he do so much dirty work. Saxe gots-ta go.✌️
What day is it on I can’t wait
It’s crazy how y’all niggas wanna watch it now, i Saw this comin a mile away 😂😂😂👎🤷‍♂️
Lol
I'll be damed if Tariq isn't dead or in jail at the ending of this Season  !!!!
This Power season is going crazy every week, the suspense and expectation are keeping increasing everytime.. I'm loving this show!! ❤ Love from India ❤
A like this show
I still don't like Tariq
Why was Ramona not at ghost funeral? Plot hole?
What a shit TV show now! Without ghost, this ain’t power.
Idk. I would have preferred Mary as a cop. She’s acting like a detective.
Show has been cool, not having Tommy & G around has been refreshing but also sad as well. Trying to get use to a "young teen" being the main attraction. He has been playing the game quite well like "G" himself, funeral was a dope last episode...loved writing of Eulogy. " I'm the manifestation of what he could NEVER be!"  That sh*t ! 👍🏾✊🏾   I'm interested Miss. Kemp, still shouldn't killed GHOST! 😂😂 .... But I get it 🙄
Why don't you post the full episodes???? Am struggling to get the pls do
Power according to ratings is still number 1 show on starz and everyone lied saying they wasnt gon watch yet not only are you watching but you watching at the same record pace as last years ratings lol
Great job starz ..People talked all that not watching only too see Power ratings is still the highest rated show on starz i mean double the next show ratings lol ppl talk all that still watching
If Tasha beats this case and walks that is so unrealistic especially since she lied about Tommy bein ghost killer..
So.... if Tasha understands what happens to rats... how is she comfortably taddle tellin on Tommy?  🤔 .. sucks for her when he finds out
Love MJB
No way ppl are watching this without ghost ???????
Loving the new show so far. I ain't too sure about Mary J Blige's acting tho. It's like there's something missing. Will see if she improves as the show progresses.
I think cane is gonna step up and take monets position within the organisation
This shit so good
yeah monet is right dead or in jail if anybody is around tariq.... but think of it.... if you be around monet  well the tejada family...is either ... dead ... y’all seen how they did Rel & Frank lmao . so i think this will be interesting
tariq has killed his father & his mom is in jail..... and his sister is dead ..monet gon have some sympathy for tariq.... when monet heard that tariq said franks a snitch... that was cool.... zeke likes him....  diana likes him & cane respects him..... so i think it’s gonna be a good bond
Y’all think y’all slick I see Tommy chasing dru & cane ;)
Mary j blige gone off one of kids
In coming hater comments oh the show isn't good without Ghost lol
Damn looks good just watched ep 2 this morning
Might as well release the full episode of Power Book II. Monet ain't come to play she either gonna straighten out Tariq or she is going to be his rival but Tariq needs a Tasha of his age to help him run tingz smoothly...true or correct?
This season of power book 2 ghost is going to be good.I will say i can't wait to watch the next episode
There are 2 parts to a funeral so ya skipped the 1st part cuz we supposed to see ghost body one final time but... And ya didnt post a r.i.p. picture of ghost so like what's going on
