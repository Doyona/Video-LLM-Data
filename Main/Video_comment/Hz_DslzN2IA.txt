Mosquitoes have some pretty cool stuff. SHAME THEY ARE A FRACKING NUSCINCE!
Been a fan for years and I only just realised that the thumbnail for this might have inspired the most terrifying character I've seen in a dream, more terrifying than the Devil himself (literally, the Devil was the main character in that dream and even his true form didn't compare to this guy). It was the very concept of entropy and time itself embodied in a humanoid form. While the Devil had no chance in defeating Time - "eventually, even gods will die," to quote Time - it was in no rush to attack. Instead it settled in a pose identical to the thumbnail of this video, stating it was happy to lie in wait because in the end, Time controls all.
Jesus created all these creatures
the jews of the insects
this guy is the only person in the world that can make the same joke 3 times and still make me laugh. HELLOOOOO!!!!
MOSKWEETOHS
When I need a good laugh, nature, and education, I go straight to this dude.  __cking hysterical 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂❤❤❤❤
Not so fun fact™: mosquitos can transmit the deadly rabbit hemorrhagic fever/disease to rabbits, both wild and domestic. So if you have rabbits make sure to check if that might be a thing you need to worry about. Make sure to check if there's a rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) vaccine available in your area and consider getting your rabbits vaccinated. The virus has a mortality rate of up to 100%, even of an animal survives it's still infectious for months and potentially even lifelong. It has an incubation period of usually around 72 hours and has no real treatment. If one of your rabbits gets it all of them have it and usually that means that over the span of a few days maybe up to two weeks the entire population will die horribly. Especially dangerous are shows and other events where rabbits from different places are gathered. Transmission happens through contaminated surfaces, clothing, droplets and bodily fluids. Carriers include mice, lice wild rabbits and mosquitos. If you're getting a newbie in your group make sure to quarantine them for at least 72 hours. Keep your rabbits safe everyone 🌻  Oh also: there's a secondary much rarer presentation that presents with lethargy, lack of appetite, weight loss and sometimes fever. This presentation is much rare and "only" comes with a mortality rate of 50 to 80% and can take weeks. In comparison the common presentation is fever, lethargy, bloody excrements, bloody gums, bloodshot eyes. Pretty much what the name says. I can't stress enough how contagious this is btw, if one animal is infected you will most likely lose your entire population. It's also harmless to humans in case anyone was concerned. If you suspect a possible infection with RHD call your vet and inform them of your suspicion, quarantine the affected animal, take good precautions regarding the possible spread (keep in mind you can easily spread it to the wild rodent population and screw yourself like that), do not allow visitors to the animal infected or any other rabbits, assume your entire population is infected and calm your local department for veterinary safety and diseases. I'm not saying this to cause panic but to spread information. If you've been to any events or any place with your rabbits in the past week make sure to inform all necessary people. We had an outbreak in my area a few years ago and while it was quickly well contained (including any shows, etc. were prevented for the entire year and the one following) the affected people lost their entire populations. I only know of a singular rabbit that survived out of a few hundreds. Just make sure to be careful if your area is affected
GOOD CONTENT AND RESPECT 🤗💎🧬💎🍂🌈🗺️👨🏻‍💻🫡🌈
🙎🏻‍♂️🕵🏻‍♂️REALLY SO BRILLIANT 🫡🙌🏻🫶🏻
I feel like asking JERRY to "fix it in post" is asking for a conundrum of a situation, lol.
zefrank I got pregnant just listening to your voice
Nuke water.
If I never see this ever again you have made my day this is the best commentary I've ever seen thank you sir
4:42 Random mosquito: emerges like Lady Gaga Elephant Mosquito: emerges like Loki, “Your savior is here “!
Super job you did! Thanks a lot.
The funniest narration I heard in a very long time.  Well done.
So well done, Amazing…
An absolutely brilliant presentation! Why were people like this not our teachers and profs? I think this is the most awesome video that the newfangled algo has fed me the last six months of otherwise slack jawed background noise. Awesome actual science and yet funny as all f**k. This is probably what the grandfathers of the Internet hoped the use would be to better our species. Well done! Perfectly done!
You know I hated mosquitos before.. After living in the northern Finland for 7 years I hated them even more.. Didnt think I could hate them even more more and be so discusted of them, but alas, here we are. Thank you.
Behold, the GA state bird.
I have mixed emotions about these species.   I will say but this: of all the creatures in our time that have become extinct, why could it not have been these type of creatures?  For those of you who love to be fascinated, search on YouTube about how a particular peoples in Africa who are immune to malaria from mosquitos due to originated Sickle Cell Anemia, which is an alternate indicative example of the peoples of the Himalayas who developed the ability to breath in extreme high altitudes.  It’s all so truly fascinating!!!!
Fun interesting educational what a great Channel
Subbed for the humour 😂
You make learning fun the exact same way my highschool chemistry teacher did.
The big bug at 3:07  Looks to be a Toe biter, a aquatic predatory bug with large grasping talons and a nasty bite  (note: I am not an entomologist, just a fan of insects, so this is at most a semi-educated guess)
HEL-LOOOO!!!
The jokes are bad, stick to the facts
1:42 sir is that a challenge ? 🤨🤨
What is this song 16:44 at the end rofl smh
Absolutely fucking fascinating
Know thy enemy
I was taking photos outside and got bitten by like 20 mosquitoes I feel like I’m going to die from some disease
The variety of life is pretty special.  Isopods are pretty cool too.  When it become the water you drink,  we’ve killed 10 to the power of 9 daily so that you won’t get sick.  Some humans need UVC too.
Did you say boobs once?  I’ve told HR twice of how much they suck.  IT doesn’t even fuck with me.
Beh-behs 😂
zefrank, i need to know...  Why do crane flies constantly dry-hump the air?
When they hatch it looks like popcorn on a cob lmao
“kill em, kill em allll “ - captain hook
I laugh way too hard at your videos. 🤣
Of course mosquitos have a boss spawn animation
You will be hearing from my lawyer.
"Demon bebe" 😂😂😂
Is anyone else watching this scratching their mosquito bite or is it just me 😓
Where can I buy the dragonfly larvae 😭
When I was little my mother had to move back home after a divorce n' as a result I lived at my grandparents for a bit. They had a very small house but a very large property, so there are about 6 motor home/trailers on them, since there was limited space in the house, my brother n' I slept in a trailer durin' this time n' let's just preface that ya go down the hill n' there is a huge ass river. Very pretty, but lots of bugs. I got bit by mosquitos so often I can get bit by a mosquito now n' just go "Ohp, that's a mosquito bite, we'll ignore that itch" n' that's it. My brain goes "Nope, we don't get itches here for a while". I dislike mosquitos but holy hecc deerflies n' horseflies can all burn. These things used to chase me relentlessly to the point that the buzzin' noise by my ear sets me off. I don't care if a mosquito is gonna bite me, it can do that if it wants, but if it buzzes by my ear to do it, it's dead.
Its like how lady gaga would come out on stage.  That was a good one
Whenever I find a body of water with mosquito larvae in it I do whatever I can to eradicate those larvae. I've shoveled dirt into puddles at our local dirt park and compacted it by smacking it with a shovel, I've tipped over various containers which had larvae in them and let the water seep into the ground and one time when the water in a bigger container was needed for wetting dirt to build jumps with and thus was not to be wasted I simply took a few scoops of water from the surface with a rag, basically using it as a net, and then wrung it out onto the ground and put it in the sun to dry.
Female Acceptance....LOOOOOOL!!!!
Poles on bumper-cars that connect to the ROOF! LOOOOOL
I love this guy‘s videos. He makes learning about animals fun and he’s just hilarious like he generally makes you wanna watch the videos and learn about these animals. He’s just an awesome narrator and he’s just all around and just a funny dude and he makes learning about animals just such fun and I enjoy everyone of his videosso I really do love this guy and I hope he continues doing what he’s doing because I generally have a good time watching his videos so I love this dude so if you happen to read this, you’re awesome
Fun fact: if you have an aquarium you can harvest mosquito larvae as healthy live food for your fishies! It's a great way of lessoning your mosquito population because the larvae whom your fish eat don't become adult mosquitos biting you!
The extra sauce he puts on "roof" at 1:21 is so unnecessary but somehow perfect
so killing off mosquitos with genetic sterility may not the best idea fir flowers afterall?

If it is; go kid.. 😄
Im itching just watching this
fun fact water scorpions are cousins to cockroaches, water scorpions can fly, swim and survive being hit by a car.
Wait…WHAT THE FU-“ caught me off guard
Who the fuck is Dale? Did Jerry went AWOL ? 😉
I love your videos but I hate the Mosquito
That big ugly bug is a water scorpion...

I think wild animals want to show us what demons want, not what we are.
As much as I dislike them, they are interesting to study.
Little bastards
Half 2 in the the morning and just woke and accidentally hit this vid that was in the suggested YouTube queue and all i heard and saw was snuffaluffigus dildo that sprouts legs and WTF 😂😂😂😂 new sub? Fuck YEAH 👍!!!

Those Volvox are so beautiful.
"WTF"....🤣🤣🤣*DIES
Female humans should adapt to "egg bomb"😂❤
He said boob by mistake 😂
For anyone who needs to know not washing with shampoo or soap is a good way of producing natural mosquito-suide mosquitoes don’t like the natural I’m going to say lactic acid that we produce which makes unsoaped unshampooed areas less likely to be nummded on by mosquitoes
13:34 Every time I get bitten by a mosquito I want custody and child support.
(if im not misremembering) mosquitos (female mosquitoes) cause 1 in 17 humans deaths but maybe the some new equivalent of horse goo got a nobel prize and helped billions., ya never know.
This makes me want to ling rush a terran.
Hello!!
A mosquito mocked me once, wasnt funny. Just flew and looked at me when I tried to kill it
“Like how lady Gaga would come out on stage” 😂😂😂
You won't believe what this mosquito  did today.
Okay, so you’ve milked the butt, dildo, and other brazen naughty bit jokes. It’s long long past due to find new writing material. 👎 👎

7:57 "Dicked by a skeeter" 😂😂
The only thing i learned from this is that mosquitos suck, man
The mosquito mouth and the parasitic wasp stinger are very similar
So we need the just as much as we need bees? Wow
It would be nice if you could have told us at what times of the year mosquitos lay eggs and how to avoid getting 'stung' by them.
They are pollinators!? I was realy hoping they were only parasites that we can remove without dotroying the ecosystem.
The idea of a mosquito eating a frog is great
"5% of mosquitoes contain pathogens dangerous to humans"  There are over 100 trillion mosquitoes in the world   5% of 100 trillion=5 trillion   I don't like those odds.
Anderson Patricia Harris George Harris Linda
Stunning and wonderful footage with authentic information which I found  during researching mosquito killer for me :-). Good work
What the fu- got me in the washing machine
I still hate them.
At the end, all of them are pollinizers?
I wasnt expecting the second "🌟HELLOO!🌟" but i certainly needed it!!! 😂

9:08 "....and now you're getting dicked by a skitter."  Gotta appreciate Zefrank and his Oscar Wilde like word play! Stay classy, Zefrank! You magnificent bastard! 😉
I am now purposefully harvesting the larvae.  Thank you Mosquitos for free fish food :)
This is education for immature people
I just knew that the last bit would be that elephant mosquito springing out and saying, "Hello!"
watching this as i get bitten by a mosquito
I've always called those big mosquitoes "mosquito-eaters" and I'm glad that name actually isn't too far off
Love every bit of this very very entertaining
I liked the video. Informative And funny at moments. "You try breathing out of you butt" 😂.
This guy cracks me up 😆
Bebes
When he says "grow up" hes not talking to the viewer, hes talking to himself lol
Theres no fcking way this was designed by random genetic mutations in the ether
The attempt at humor was sad, ridiculous, and completely unnecessary!  Great content minus the poor attempt at humor would’ve been much more interesting and educational

Is Dale a Jack Stauber reference?
FWIW, there is a species of jumping spider that feeds on blood engorged mosquitos.  So, indirect vampire spiders.
Dildo with cool glasses 😂... sad ghost shrimpy thing 😂

The babe part lol 😂 got me
You reminded me to close my window right now
U are funny in love
WTF did I just watch... LOL. Love this type of documentary.
“Both numbing the nerves and suppressing the immune response” I call bs because mosquito bites HURT
And that, folks is why you never swallow the water which you’re swimming in 😖
Love that the narrator can leave some jokes around
I didn't get arrested and it's the best feelin ever...
Mulțumesc pentru video! 🇷🇴
I thought this would be interesting but, the narration is so stupid I had to turn it off
Who called them anunaki
Great video ❤❤❤
I wonder how smart they really are
Love these clips.. its always good to learn and to make it funny too is a bonus.. you got a subscriber
This made me so damn itchy
2:11
Was a water bug..
Demon baby 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mosquitoes are literally the  cornerstone of my atheism.
Now all we have to do is find a way to Destroy them all before they start draining my friggin blood and buzzin in my gdam ears.
I cant believe there’s a whole 17 minutes of this
Demon Baby is my go to clip
The wings are almost paddling through the air
Love the way Ze Frank narrates his videos. Great.
Butt snorkels.
Hello!
I know this is going to sound unhinged and like I am a psycho, but hear me out. This is how to prevent mosquito attacks.  Before you judge me, here is a brief backstory on my ongoing war. I am constantly bitten. At one stage I had bites covering my body and there were so many that my mom decided to try and count them. After counting the area from shoulder to wrist of one arm, she got to 180, and then she decided to stop counting. that was in one area and my whole body was covered like that. Whenever I sleep in a room with other people, I will wake up with multiple bites and no one else will have any.  I have tried every mosquito repellent on the market and none work. The dishwashing liquid thing doesn't work on the evil ones who attack me. It has gotten to the stage that a fan blowing directly at me, at point-blank range, at full speed, has medium efficiency. I used to stay up all night with a light and a toilet roll to focus the light and draw them in so I could swat them.  One day, at a party, I was in a conversation with a person that I had just met that day and he told me that he would kill his mosquitoes, and then line them up next to his bed to warn other mosquitoes not to mess with him and that this worked. Half of me thought "This guy is crazy" and the other part knew he had been through the struggle.  One night, a long time after meeting him, in a moment of desperation, I tried it out, and to my surprise, it worked! I have no clue how or why it works, but displaying their fallen comrades scared them off somehow.  I usually don't tell this story, because I know how crazy and evil it makes me sound, but in this comment section, I feel safe. I feel like I have found my people and it brings tears of joy to my eyes. An enemy of my enemy is my friend ❤
I havent even started the video yet and YT gave me an ad for mosquito pest services 😂
5:05 Well, i asked the FAA if I could transfer my "convulsive swimming" experience into a pilot's license.  I'll give you three guesses about their answer...
Fuck mosquitoes.
why do all insects which live a part of their life in water always look like hellspawn when shedding?
first time watching this channel, i aint watching again, this mf all he talks is about sex chill out man, you're hornyer than a 14yo
people in the comments congratulating the elephant mosquito for not biting humans and saying theyre the only exception to the "mosquitos are evil" rule, while conveniently ignoring that almost all mosquitos pollinate (6:00) and that most species of mosquitos arent interested in human blood. (9:40) All this to say, hatred of mosquitos is absolutely overblown, and advocating for the eradication of any animal, including those that are inconvenient or deadly to us, is dumb.
Just imagine if we were more like Mozzies - the PD could end child abuse by going around once again
this video makes me itchy 😅
Reminds of the absolutely mind boggling amount of mosquitoes in the Yukon Territory of Alaska. It’s as tho air itself was mosquito up there
I once read that CRISPR technology could be used to force mosquitoes entirely into extinction. I’m fine with that.
Your comments are stupid, shut up!!!
Absolutely no reason to make inappropriate comments when children watch these videos.
You know, I wouldn’t mind sharing my blood with mosquitoes if they weren’t such assholes about it. I’ve always wanted to be a blood donor anyway. But they just have to make the bites itchy and inject diseases. Ungrateful little bitches.
funny thing that the way you say mosquito around minute 1:00 semms almost like "moscovito" in italian, that is any male born in Moskov, of course apart from your wonderful jokes ^^
Evil disgusting creatures lol
Dicked by a Skeeter sounds like a bad Ska Band. 😂
"what the fffffff" and "butt" got me laughing 😂😂😂😂😂
oh my god youre so funny, pls dont die due to mosquito
Just got released from jail can now say his joke was impractical
You have to do an episode on midges. I learned that Scottish midges are the bitey ones, whereas most midges throughout the world are innocuous…. That is, if you don’t think about why they want to hold social parties around erect humans.
My mom absolutely loves this video. She shows the educational edit to her class every year. She told me that I need to watch it again just ‘cause.
When you said "Grow up" how did you know I was spraying my coffee everywhere due to "Johnston's organ" lmao! I felt like I was 3 y.o. for a second, like when you used to think the TV could see you!
I know I watched this before but I must watch it again! Get some spinosad it will eat the larvae
Today I learned there are some flowers that can go extinct as well.
Dicked by a skeeter is my favorite quote of all time.
Catchy end-credits musics...
rick james was onto something. nature is super freaky 🎷🐛
I know biden speaks out his ass
Someone or multiple people had to willingly allow mosquitoes to feed on them for this footage and I think I’d rather die 💀😂
I feel so much better about my existence 😅👽✨🎶🎵 #natureisafreak 💃🏼🎵🎶
Mosquitos are also quite near the very bottom of the food chain so; no mosquitos, no everything above them in the food chain. Then where would we be…..? Dead. That’s what.
Why can’t the elephant mosquito be the only one to exist
Phuk mosquitos
More than I ever wanted to know about these nasty little biters, Fascinating 8-|
Air Butt: Spikes Back
So, people who have been sucked off by Female Mosquitos are somewhat parents because the Female Mosquitos use the blood to make babies? Interesting Facts.
All you stop your bullst. I moved from Philly to Texas. They eat you here
I don't know who you are but your a funny dude.
This is an amazing video explanation i ever enjoyed. Thanks Ze
You have beat Morgan freeman as the best male voice!!!! AND you can sing!!!
Amazing content! thank you immensely!
Mosquito: You seem upset. Triggered. What's eating you? Human: You! Mosquito: Ha ha. Well, yes. Besides me, what's eating you?
genocide is almost always a terrible thing. Almost!
Does anyone else hear the cosmic mosquito? 🦟?
Bro this guy is wild! I love it! I am both learning AND laughing!
[22:73]   O people! A parable is presented, so listen to it: Those you invoke besides God will never create a fly, even if they banded together for that purpose. And if the fly steals anything from them, they cannot recover it from it. Weak are the pursuer and the pursued. (Quran 22:73)
6:08 Bro called pollen "Plant Sperm" 💀💀
Fun fact: the reason mosquito bites are itchy is that basically everyone is allergic to them/their saliva. This is an evolutionary adaptation to encourage humans to avoid mosquitos, & thus the malaria & other pathogens they can carry!
He-llo! lol love your channel.
my boner:
Zefrank has made laugh consistently thru the years. This was the first time i laughed so much that i was crying. The intro....😂😂😂
Just the intro make me love it. Jajaja amazing work
Gustavo fring???

Ohh God didn't  know tou can pack sooo much humor into a mosquito topic lol...😂😂😂
The idiotic narration ruined this video

We’re surrounded by aliens. It’s awesome
Shout out to all the elephant mosquitoes out there! They eat other larvae and nectar.
I love this guy 😂
Fascinating! But do they fart bee's?😂😂😂😂😂
W elephant mosquitos.
Worst. Swimming Pool. Advice. Ever.
i'm sorry but the way this was phrased made me wheeze-  timestamp for what i'm talking about: 12:05
I kill mosquitoes who bites but I'm not a misogynist. 😂
You're funny. This is freakier than a alien movie. 😂
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆,   THE BEST TEACHER EVER,
You sold out. Your bad. Good luck, zefrank, and I'm at least the oldest, or one of, your oldest fans. So tell Jerry to shove it in farther. Hope you're profitable, yet fail. Minus the lube.
Hell-O!  😆
"People are very good at killing people"  That got me laughing.
Pro tip: You'll feel better watching this in winter.
I f**king hate mosquito's!
Looking at them up close just makes them more exterminatable.
DEMON. BABY.
Mosquitos, worst invention ever.
man a dildo that is clear 😔💔
0:17 - 0:19 - 0:25 and 2:10 - 2:11 and 4:41 I replayed this part
"Now it's getting dicked by a skeeter." So many phrases I have coined from this show. I used "thinky thinky bits" in a paper this semester. Got an a.
Those images were in. Sane! First winner of the Best Written Thing of the Week, congrats my g.
I need that mosquito song on spotify
How is “snuffalupagus but reimagined as a dildo” not the top comment of YouTube?😁
I need more of this. These videos are addictive!
Ze frank: Grow up. Me: no
Babies
Bebes
Elephant Mosquito knows it is the best Mosquito simply by that entrance
WTF do male mosquitoes do? No help here!
“And now it’s getting dicked by a skeeter” is the best thing I’ve heard in a while 😂
Thanks I hate it.
😂 I need your songs in sportify
15:39 looks like how satan gets his rice
I hate mosquitoes but dis was interesting
10:22 is about Mosquitos and Humans, excluding only 5% carry disease but that 5% has killed more people than any other species including us. Pretty much only commenting this because I want to show someone later and I'm too tired to remember the time stamp
It look like a an evil , psycho panda lol 🐼
Now I remember why I couldnt finish this episode 😖 holes
Dude I like your style.   Don't wanna Google that.. It'll get mixed with my porn. Hilarious
I'm scared now.
This guy,  should be on, stage 😂
This should be required curriculum.
I probably killed thousands of mosquitoes in my life now here i am learning about them, i don't know what to make of this

Verily, Allah is not ashamed to set forth a parable even of a mosquito or so much more when it is bigger (or less when it is smaller) than it. And as for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord, but as for those who disbelieve, they say: "What did Allah intend by this parable?" By it He misleads many, and many He guides thereby. And He misleads thereby only those who are Al-Fasiqun (the rebellious, disobedient to Allah). 2:26
While I was watching this a lot of mosquitoes gathered around me 😂
Thanks I hate it!
How the hell am I just finding this?😂😂😂😂😂 definitely going to have to subscribe and check out all these videos. I laughed within the first 15 seconds
The Secret Lives of Mosquitoes Unveiling Nature's Tiny Terrors
Channel Animal Planet: Funny series.
Him telling me to "grow up" is so funny, i can't breathe
Did you know that the holy Quraan in Surat “ Al bakkara (2)”“ verse 26” says the following: Indeed, Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, "What did Allah intend by this as an example?" He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not except the defiantly disobedient,  Quraan has been on earth for 1500 years! Think about it
watching this with over 20 bites on my legs 😭
haha what an awesome ass ahaha 🤣
Friendly tip: One teaspoon of water can breed 100 mosquitos.   So check your yard and anything that holds water ESPECIALLY old tires. You need to empty them out because if you have a mosquito problem. Chances are they are breeding in some old bucket or tire and alot of species stay close to home. IE your yard.    Also. Minnows are your best friends against mosquitos.   If you can capture a bunch of minnows then you can release them into ponds and other things that hold water all year around.   Minnows eat mosquito larva. Remember that.
No I won't like them
Mosquitos are responsible for more humans than anything else. They have killed BILLIONS of humans over the life span of our species. And we didn't even hit 1 billion people until 1804.
Al-Fatihah  🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 "In the Name of GOD—the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful. All praise is for GOD—Lord of all worlds, the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful, Master of the Day of Judgment. You ˹alone˺ we worship and You ˹alone˺ we ask for help. Guide us along the Straight Path, the Path of those You have blessed—not those You are displeased with, or those who are astray. Amen."  Please pray these words now, pray them as you read them if you cannot look and remember them 🙏 start praying on a daily basis (even if it's only once a day) and it will really help you, you just have to remember to do it 😊 so try to make it a habit, it is a good one to have
BEBES
Omg the reader i cant 😂
Animal Planet done right :)
😂🤣😂
Hilarious and informative,  thank you!
Science for morons!
I cannot stand the narration what a turn off
I only meant to watch for a minute and ended up watching the whole thing 😂
So im a dad ?😁
BUTT first......Lol!
Thanks for the warning. 😂
"Snuffleufulgus reimagined as a dildo" Pure poetry my dude.
There's a Skeeter on my peter...wack it off😂
cool, I just found out how to lay mosquito eggs like that, I like it...  ￼
why did he say roof like that
Disgusting not-funny-at-all jokes!
All of these videos have very interesting contents and a delivery that feels hand-crafted for a high trip.
Ain't nothing beautiful about a mosquito j itchy bug bites
I wish i had a kid like this in my classes. Would have made presentations awesome!
Pay with money wherever you go, no kard or phone.
that connect to the rroooOF? God I love this bit 1:18
I don't care what mosquitoes polinate, they should stay far away!!!
These silly trouble makers...silly mosquitoes
Fucking mosquitos.
Thank You for sharing the miracle of life!
Malditos bichos chupasangre
Bro I got so itchy watching this
"Psychos" stigmatizing mental illnesses is so funny bro 😐
Love the way he says bebays (babies)
I came here to say…kill all skeeters!
Apparently, Horse Flies also do a similar thing to Mosquitos and for the same reason.
WHAT HAPPEN IF I PUT HOT SAUCE IN THEIR AIR HOLE!!! NEED TO KNOW! LOL :D
Got here after being attacked by horde of mosquitoes... 😑😑😑
Should have killed those abominations instead of filming them.
I didn't know the life of a headphone was literally hell until now, thanks Ze Frank!
I remember when I was a kid you couldn't go outside because of the mosquitoes were so bad, I still live in the same area and I haven't seen a mosquito and I don't know how long. The same with the black flies used to be so bad you couldn't go outside to work in the garden, New York hardly ever see them.
Its so nice to learn more about my state bird!
Only 1 fact I need to know about mosquitos. How can I kill them all?
THESE MOSQUITOES WERE RELEASED INTO SOCIAL MEDIA SITES. BITING AND DRAWING BLOOD IS THEIR M.O.
This video kept appearing on my recommendations. I kept ignoring it but just decided what the hell I'll check it out.   I was like wtf is this guy's problem? Anyway..  <Subscribed>
thought about this video nonstop while nursing a nice set of four mosquito bites. mosquitos being primarily pollinators and therefore valuable became my mantra.
They'd be fascinating if they weren't so annoying.
lol this has to be the itchiest video on youtube.
I breathe out my butt but it makes a horrendous noise and my wife calls it farts and it's only exhaling, no inhaling. Always out, never in. FEELS GOOD SMELLS BAD
Only thing a mosquito is hood for is copying is flight mechanizems
8:39 the most wildest thing you will hear/see and imagine it in your own species😂
Love being human and looking up a species for it weakness and get its flight patters to memorize 😂, wont reveal knowledge on humans tho wisley stupid arent we obviously "no cap" huh?
these stupid things should burn in heck
😂 bro your funny as fuck bro for real hahaha  I can’t remember the last time. I laughed this hard about pissed myself. I’m going to follow you man see what else you got this shit is funny.
Good god, man!!  I don’t think I’ve seen ANY videos - ANY - as well documented.  You give us all of it!!  Fascinating info given with just the right amount of humor, potty talk, and sarcastic sexual innuendos.  Every video you’ve given us is presented so perfectly, I could listen for much longer and enjoy it, unlike college chemistry lectures.  This one?  “..dicked by a skeeter” 😂 it was dang funny! Frank, you must have at least a couple of science degrees or PhD, or whatever the fuck paper saying you are numero uno for intelligence and wittiness.   ❤
First 30 seconds lmfao
evolution is totally and utterly incredible!!!  and so is ZeFrank. 😋 🌷🌱🦇🦟🦝🕊️🐙🪼🦄oops!
Fucken comedy even tho I get attacked constantly I note don’t hate them as much
What are mosquitos good for??? How about feeding fish? They make great fish food. Gambusia hunt them down
Morgan Freeman vibes.
Very educational. Thank You, ZFrank. 🎯
damn this video sure is a funny one;educational but with a slices of jokes .jokes aside this has helped a lot in grasping whats going in the insect world.hopefully this will help me in my Entomology prepartion for masters
The existence of these mistakes makes me endlessly angry. Why can't man target these for mass genocide instead of cool and useful animals
Hehehehe "Johnston's organ"  I'm such a child
It brings me joy to know that mosquitoes even get bit by mosquitoes
Insects are the closest thing we have to pokemon in the world, change my mind.
6:30 Where can I get the eggs of this elephant wondersquito?! I need a lot of them to killmur... ekhm... control the local mosquito population. Like, urgently.
Your humor was gross..cool vid though
I don't know how I stumbled onto this video but I'm glad I did😂
Haha!  Hello!! -mosquito
The Devil’s children. 🦟
This is why I have goldfish and mosquito fish in my ponds in my back yard as well as keeping the water moving with a pump and filter system.  I got dengue in Puerto Rico and learned to be careful of the suckers.
the most deserve extinct insect ever
The way he says baby drives me crazy lol
Tropical aquarium fish love mosquito babies!
12:05 lmao I’m dead
god i fucking hate mosquitoes
I feel like I just watched a resident evil breakdown 🤣🤣
Karen smiles. She Loves to listen to each LOUD Censor beep, Butt first......But, first, She has to turn up the volume, to enjoy the torture noise, with Her headphones on.
My respect for mosquitos increased immensely after watching their entrance to adulthood. That is badass
Hellooo!!!
LMMFAO
Love this video. Educational and fun. Thanks guys.
Is there a way to download a version of the mosquito song? It gives me a lift when I hear it 16:28
Do you know what the most deadly organism on the planet is? The mosquito! All blood sucking disease spreading mozzies should be wiped out to the point of extinction. We have the technology to do that y'know. Imagine it.. walking around the neighborhood on a cool summers eve enjoying the fresh air without being mercilessly mauled by mozzies!
Best Youtube channel I've ever come across ty Killing Dead Things
Mother flipper! Today, I learnt that a mosquito can sue me for child support.
this guy makes learning fun! lol
This is insane
Professor Ze Frank? Please teach Us all about Statistics, next time. Thank You for Your Service.
I almost spit out my drink when heard Deamon Baby xD hahaha awesome one!
How violently this guy explained things every second with beeps
This guy is not nearly as funny as he thinks he is
Man i thought its little fishies as a child..i helped them 😅
So the mosquitoes Resin 3D print themselves!
I lost it at demon baby 😂
That wtf was the best
Looks like a Dark Souls boss. 😧
The best thing about this channel is the narration. This guy is just funny!😂
Who,who have got bitten by mosquito while watching this video ? 🦟
God I love winter!!
It’s slightly warmer than last month here in Brazil (still winter though) and I’m already collecting mosquito bites
Aw I hate mosquitos...  * clicks video*  But literally growing up where I did in Louisiana, we had to learn about the life cycle of mosquitoes to prevent them from spreading.
HELLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOO!
didn't know there was a best misquito
Childish
Such a tiny creature is capable of infecting a fully grown human being and ultimately even killing them in their millions.
This man is hilarious !!! I ❤ his videos.
0:25
3rd? time i liked your videos...yes i even watched and liked the originals ya made. ty Zfrank and i hope they start paying ya more.
I don’t care if they do one thing good, I hate mosquitos more than any creature on Earth.
I'm a daddy! 🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟
Bill Gates loves Mosquitos!
'it's so tough to be a baybe..'
How many people have slapped a mosquito and just smeared blood on the arm lol why do they target certain people it must be chemical they can detect good blood idk lol biting fly are a nuisance too
U might say nature is a big sucker lol
Think about how a bat population keeps a  mosquito population in check and bat poop is good for a garden lol
Stress test in a condom factory 😅
This is hilarious great comedy for adults plus learning experiences
I love the way he says babies 😂
The jacknife in the pool got me
Good job. I am so happy to learn so much
I lived in Africa. Had malaria a few times. And apart from that truly wondered what was the point of mosquitoes? Obviously probably a food for something else but i didn't know they were pollinators. Like bees. Hate mosquitoes even so. Well the ones that can kill you.
At 4:31 “It's like how Lady Gaga comes out on stage. Very dramatic” hahaa... Not you mentioned my Queen Lady Gaga in this video... LMFAO. Gaga is so iconic and maybe she was inspired by how mosquitoes make an entrance. Your video is really awesome and entertaining to watch. I love it. Great sharing.
“People are very good at killing people”  I learn something.
Biggest sh%t i've learned is you sexuilazation,  You're pretty Creepy dude ? ( BUT I bet you get that alot?)  ever been investigated ? Just wonder about the larva statments? Also all of you video's have some sexuial content in the nariation. It's my Oppinion but sure others see this as well. Keep up the good work.
I'm watching this so that I can learn how to get rid of all the mosquitoes in the world
This was the weirdest video commentary 😩
Lmao .( Bebe
Poo-pah-tay
“Mosquitoe Le BeBe”
As much as I enjoyed this video, but holy shit it made me itchy
Can't watch this, narrator is too annoying.
This is legit hilarious man. Great stuff.
This is brilliant. I have to subscribe. Science classes should play your videos sir. Genius. Pure genius.
Damn dude where have u been in my YouTubeife, subscribed 😂
The cursing is unnecessary
You mean bio engineered wepaons?
YOUR WHACKED OUT
Most entertaining freaking documentary on mosquitos ever!!! 😂😂😂
No such thing as false facts....
This program has a lot of information. But the sarcasm of this guy talking what the f****** idiot.
Hellgrammite to the rescue 🤣🤣
My nemesis 😫
The last 90 minutes I have spent killing 4 mosquitos harassing me in my sleep. It is 0457 hours. This is one insect I would risk armageddon for to have it extinct.
I think it's funny that i learn more from true facts than i did school
Where do i find the song at the end?
Wow clearly this person has not been above 10,000 feet, middle of the day, sun out! Or subtropical climate, even a tropical climate. OFF just seems to piss them off(no pun intended)to bite harder !!! I’ve had the privilege of being in all three, and there’s just nothing beautiful about a mosquito! Yes, because we are human and we are always looking for the beauty in all and positivity in all of creation. Nobody will mourn the loss of mosquitoes and flies. Hey Siri.
so education can be hilarious. i love you.
The attempt to inject into the narrative what they imagine would pass off as humour is just pathetic.  Some people are very clever, just like the mosquito.
This is one of the best things I’ve watched on the internet….
Lovely dear.. Galactic life may come from this way.. Process from like shown vedio to master cloned robotic atoms.. Jago Baramand.. Arun Jagoji JaMBhuLKaR..
The most detailed documentary! Thx for being so frank! :)
Ever been bit by a mosquito, and tried to kill it and you missed it after it had a full stomach of your blood..it hurts mentally if the mosquito missed your death penalty 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It’s quite astonishing how such complexity comes in such a small organism.
now dat bebe ded bebe 2:56
Honestly you could’ve said, “True Facts about Mosquitoes:  F*ck ‘em; roll credits, Steven.” And it would’ve made the perfect video.
Forgotten fact: A bitch animal
I felt an itch the whole time😭😂
that is great Jerry
thanks
8:48 "shes an of age mosquito!"
Very interesting video, super illustrated and narrated, about the life cycle of this tiny and dangerous creature. Could you please put subtitles in Spanish? Thank you so much.
This narrator sounds like a narrator who used 2 narrate cartoons back in the 70s ,2 b precise rocky & bolwinkle cartoons.
How did I find this channel 😭😂
Such a great documentary!! What a pity I could never use this in lessons to teach children because of all the inappropriate (but very funny) adult jokes woven in. Would subscribe if the content was child appropriate..
Thanks a lot
Very Nice Thank You.
The narrator had me dying with his funny comments while presenting the video,  just made it a lot more fun to watch 😊
A great presentation. As a scientist, I particularly appreciate the information about the sources, and the researchers who studied these insects. High quality information that could very easily be part of a teaching program at a university. Entomology made still more fascinating!
Not amused by the sick comedy. Ze Frank sounds like an idiot.
SKEETERS ARE SUCKERS  🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟
Whats more shocking is what the Quran says about it, 1400 years ago
How come the mosquitos do not blow away in the wind?
Why does everything have to have bad language in it? I guess theres no class in anything anymore...
I hope they go extinct
5:29 that "grow up" was perfectly timed. Bravo
I am still amazed at how some people think that this came by coincidence! God Almighty says in Surah Al-Baqara, Verse 26: "Indeed, Allah is not timid to present an example - that of a mosquito or what is smaller than it. And those who have believed know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, "What did Allah intend by this as an example?" He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not except the defiantly disobedient"
I guess telling them to "blow it out your a$$" wouldn't really work 🤔
Moscoweetoes
I started feeling itchy just from watching this lol
Lmfao. I love how I just was taking a bite into my bagel when he was talking about holes and grabbing a bagel. Wow!
Lol...true facts! lmao😅😅  all facts are true...😅lol...wtf😮😮 i mean do you have any videos of False facts....nope😊
0:16 That kind of looks like Slimer ... he's taller now? oh no no no no bye
These things make me swell up so bad when they bite me. I want them all to die.
Today was the day i was released from prison from trying to breathe through my arsehole at the local swimming pool from this video exactly one year ago  ... thanks a lot yt😑
I legit come back to this every so often just to listen to the absolute banger at the end lmao
mosquito babe-by 😆
Yoi can try this yoself
😆 know as whaaaat
When I see mosquitoes larvae in a bucket in my backyard, I just dump the bucket out right in the hot sun
The Elephant Mosquito watching other mosquitos laying their eggs: HELLO!😈
We Stan the Elephant Mosquito. HELLO!
... @1:42… I Know That FACE... 👀
Beautiful quality video absolutely ruined by a desperate effort to be funny.
This is why if you spray Pam cooking oil on the surface of stagnant water on your property you can prevent mosquitoes without using poison  The film of oil over-the-water prevents the larvae from getting oxygen
That’s me that’s why I sleep outside
Love your way of talking 😊
I can't believe I love mosquitoes
killed me  at johnstones organ. https://youtu.be/Hz_DslzN2IA?t=319
What is wrong with you? Do you really have to sexualize everything and make it more disgusting than you are? And why do content makers from Brilliant and Nebula have the worst possible jokes after the show FRIENDS
Can we take a moment to appreciate how the camera man went inside a human body just to film a mosquito
Wonderful presentation. Silly, ridiculous  explanation.
Pollen=plant sperm
The Intro was so AMAZING
now that behbeh ded behbeh
Take this moment to thank the elephant mosquito for getting rid off the biter’s. Thank you elephant mosquito.
Thank you, i have now learned more about the enemy
This guy sounds like the cat from “dear kitten” videos.
This guy is so freaking funny! This is how mosquitos do.
6:39 Hellooo!
but well, HELLO 👋
I gotta tell you this is the most hilarious information I've ever watched. Loved it!!!
bro that song at the very end SLAPS
2:11 Ḏ̵͍͌E̸̯̐M̶͇̝͝Õ̴̤̚N̴̹̽ ̸̥́̇B̸̈́A̶̫͂̎B̴̩̅E̷̝̔H̶̦̀̈́
at 4:40 I heard in Robin Williams voice.
I wonder why bill gates would be infecting mosquitos with a virus and releasing them into the population👽
It was with it for the song at the end ..Mosquito says Hello
"This allows them to fly in the dark without bumping into things." Have you ever seen a mosquito fly?
The stuff your saying is so dumb !! Porn ? Point your ass out in the water ? Interesting 🤔
Wow I'm so glad I watched this video 🦟This Guy Deserves a reward for his Great sense of Humor made it much easier to watch the hard visuals 🤣🤣🤣
Total mosquito death
Dont want THAT in my search history mixed in with the porn......😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I had to stop the damn video I was laughing so hard
Horrifying
*they are into feet* that explains why they choose that part the most on my body, they love the top part.
تبارك الله أحسن الخالقين
I like how he's talking like it's a documentary but he also laughs a little bit through the video
.  Too bad so much filth.  Great info surrounded by filth that spoils it.  Disappointing.
Go extinct
why cant my area have the mosquitos that dont wanna role play as dracula with me
bill gates wet dream
Hilarious! 😂 really good!!
such shame that any of these mosiquito "babies" survived, such is life, full of disappointments
i hear gustavo fring
I got a lot of laughs out of this one, never change good sir
I just came to say I hate mosquitos, ty
Like one time he said boob… 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You’re very engaging with the humor.  I love it?
Can’t believe I have thousands of tiny kids out there 😮😢 ooof 😅 no child support just greedy for blood
Fuck these things
Only 1 fact I need to know about mosquitos, they freaking suck
i came here wondering if this would make me see mosquitos in a more positive light, and maybe make me think twice about killing them.    nope. i just want them all to go back to hell even moreso now
the insect world is fascinating
anyone on board to buy and release a sh*t ton of elephant mosquitoes in places they don't normally occur?
I wish you had a kid friendly version that I could show my kids!!
Narrator: Gus Fring.
I am doesn’t like mosquitoes
not for kids hey?
Well you certainly have an interesting presentation style. Lol
Mosquitos are primarily useful for being at the bottom of the food chain in water ecosystems. Without mosquitos the rest of the ecosystem struggles.
Did I just heard Lady Gaga?
Just watching this video makes me feel itchy
Do gophers and coyotes
Spoiled by unnecessarily vulgar narration - stopped watching
Now that we understand these evil little monsters, let's make them EXTINCT!
BEBE 😂😂
I didn't have a fear of lots of tiny little holes before watching this.
I would prefer a "talking" chicken over a mosquito any day Jerry.
Educative and Funny
I should not get as excited as I do about Ze Frank uploads True Facts.
2:11 d e m o n       b a b y
the "hel-LO" never gets old
I'm pretty sure that the famous creature in the "Alien" franchise took many cues from the infamous mosquito. Because.. gross.
Omg please keep making more❤
Love the commentary
Bill Gates pets...
My teacher played this to us😭🙏🏾
Who says we haven't been invaded by alien species?
I will never get tired of listening to these; die of  laughter, cleverly factual, educational videos that give me happiness. 😅
Dale ??   Where is Jerry  ?   Did you send him to where invisible side kicks go to die ?   ...I'll bet the hippopotamus got Jerry🙁 🦛😮  Great video never stop lol ! Be well🦋
Here in the up of Michigan the mosquitoes are so big I saw a wood tick on one.
I got the creepy crawly feeling watching those eggs hatch at the beginning. Did not like. Mosquitoes can just go extinct already. F them.
Hell-O!
Skeeters all the way down.😂😂😂
They're good for feeding bats.
0:16  "It looks Snuffleupagus but reimagined as a dildo. Wearing glasses."  Hahaha! I mean, I guess it does.
I always like your sense of humor, but this one was special! You had some great one-liners :)  I always refer to Supaba (Superbowl) when that time of year comes around. I don't watch football, and neither do my friends. But it's always a good reason to bring you up, Ze :)
Little dude at 3:13 is a giant water bug! One of my favorite bugs :)
Amazing footage and presentation.  Completely bomb.  I was glued to each moment from start to finish.  Brilliant.  Thank you!
What the fuu!😂😂🎉
When you said mosquitos are pollinators I instantly felt bad for every mosquito I've killed
I wonder if there were fewer mosquitoes that feed on humans during COVID-19 quarantine/masking.
"Now that bebe, a dead bebe" 🤣 I laughed so hard
Killing humans seems to be what their good for Jerry! Lol
Friggin' top notch as always!
The origin of the mosquito can be traced back to the origin of the Universe, when everything evil and nasty condenced into one single creature: the mosquito
I love this guy!  He is absolutely hilarious.
!!!
"Dale, I really think you shou... WHAT THE F...?!"  I'm commenting 30 seconds into the video, because I've watched this 5x already 😂😂
I just want to squeeze some dish soap into every shot of water in this video
I want to meet this “Jerry”!
I'm sick of the puerile humor.
There are about 5 people in the entire human history that I say I wish they were my father and now I have found one I really wish he was my brother.
Fuck theme
The “helllOOO!” at the end was just such a wonderful surprise.
This one was horrifying.
You are listening to six brains packed into one brain probably really bored but somewhat entertained by itself and all of us. Let's boogey.
bless the algorthm, also dont read chapter 10 in Junji Ito's spiral into madness
Just discovered your channel while trying to learn about mosquitos with our 3 year old. 24 seconds in. Will watch this later.
They can pollinate like honey bees? o.O I thought they were just pure evil, LOL. :p  That, and wasps, according to Caleb City anyway. :p
So what do we need the blood meal mosquitoes for if we already have a perfectly good mosquito that won't bite? The parastic types didn't even originate here in the U.S. It was brought on slave ships. At least over in this country, I'd be in favor of just eliminating the annoying biting types. We can keep the polinators. Seriously, it wouldn't upset an ecosystem that existed long before these things were brought over here.
Aw that poor dead amphibibaby.
Oh wow they are pollinators.   Well we don't need those flowers anymore. .  Summer is to close for me to thumbs up this video right now
The start should win a Nobel price
beubys
I have that thing where lots of holes freak me out, I appreciate the heads up
If I found a Genie's lamp and got three wishes, at least one of them would be for Mosquitoes to feel pain.
Mosqweeto.
Mosquitoes are good for feeding bats, and, many insectivores. But, mainly making many, many more mosquitoes.
3:10 giant water bug
I struggle with ADD my entire life. If you were my teacher as a kid, I’m positive I would’ve excelled in science.
Wow ya know I had no idea mosquitoes are pollinators
Get a little kid's plastic pool. Fill it with water and wait until mosquitoes start laying their eggs in it, then dump the water. Repeat. You will be mosquito-free all summer.
Buy dragon flys and let them mate and grow to swarm,  will enjoy eating the mosquitos!
Ew
Mosquito says.... helllloooowww!
I saw a crane emerging from a pond and it had wings and it flew around and alighted on my hand. It had thermal and gas detecting sensors a looking for something and finally it unsheathed its drill bit and inserted the pipe to suck oil of my veins. curious thing is that it makes its own replicas. Can i devise such an awesome flying monster. 😏
😂 I still hate the little f*ckers
❤
This guys descriptions on the videos crack me up, lol.
15:27 mmmmmm rice
Who is Dale? Where is Frank?
It's a dam toe biter lol
Ok. Can we all just like this comment because this one like for one life for the earbuds they almost got mated with by a mosquito😂
I never want to have a mosquito bite me ever again
They sure do love butt stuff
10:49 I never thought I'd be able to relate to a mosquito.
(إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَسْتَحْيِي أَن يَضْرِبَ مَثَلًا مَّا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا ۚ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِن رَّبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَيَقُولُونَ مَاذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِهَٰذَا مَثَلًا ۘ يُضِلُّ بِهِ كَثِيرًا وَيَهْدِي بِهِ كَثِيرًا ۚ وَمَا يُضِلُّ بِهِ إِلَّا الْفَاسِقِينَ) (26) البقرة
Dale? What happened to Jerry? RIP Jerry lol
Incredible.
If you have trypophobia skip from 0:29 to 1:03
👍🏾
3:10 Water bug...
He kills me every time he said babies😂
Mosquitoes got no business having a sick ass boss intro wtf
<3
This episode made me itch.
1450 years ago God has given example of mosquito in the book of Quran, people that time said "what a pity God mentions small thin weak creature in this Holly book what's the point. TODAY science has proved that scientists all over the word can not create 1 species of mosquito though more than 3000 species of mosquitos has been found so far, a mosquito which has 100 eyes on his head, 6 needles, a substance work to numb the spot, 3 hearts, flying techniques, process how they evolve or born and list goes on..... SubhanAllah there is nothing unusefull un quran everything has an meaning and sign for those who are eager to know the truth.
,,This might be a good time to go to the kitchen and get something to eat.'' I'm already in the kitchen, eating. What now? :D
8000th comment
The beginning is why I always put vegetable oil in my water drums. Floats at the top and stops these dirt balls from breathing  They all drown lol
I have always considered mosquitos to be my messengers and personal body guards in this messed up thing we call the game 🎮
"People are very good at killing people." - Another fact.
the most dangerous species on the planet.
what about mosquito Hawks?
Make more music plz. U r hilarious
my friend got chikengunya from mosquito bite. its one of the worst diseases u can get :(
Thanks, I hate it.
Serious question, why do mosquito bite some people and not others?  Ta ❤
Not funny at all
So the true bug, the one with the stabby sucky mouth bit is a water bug. Aka toe biter. I think they are some of the biggest insects in North America. And they are venomous!
"Be-bes" hahaha oh my god i can't get enough 😂😂😂😂😂😂😉
Jaw-dropping verses have mentioned in the Holy Quran regarding  mosquito and it's creation.everyone should search it. All the praises praises be to Allah☝️💞☝️
0:25 “WTF!”  Ze Frank is the best comedy! XD
Butt first...; but first, let's talk about our sponsor...
I just sat down to eat my bagel….dang it!
its the humour for me
👏🤤
Watching the mosquitoe molt from its pupae is very oddly satisfying.
You and wop are perfect 💪💪🥰🥰🥰
Love your narration 🤣🤣🤣🤣
So many of us are parents to so many mosquitoes... And maybe even grandparents and great grandparents. Damn.
They need to go extinct
It's scary that only some species bite, even fewer bite humans, and only the females during a specific time in her life cycle, and yet they still managed to kill more humans than any other animal, even more than humans killing other humans.  Imagine if ALL of them bite humans, then we might need to find some way to nuke the mosquito population.
Sehr informativ!
This is very interesting and I tremendously enjoy the information.   Honestly though, maybe it’s me and I don’t have a sense of humor but I would prefer these without the silly commentary.
3:00 I too would like to be eaten by the face 1st and not my butt 🤣🤣
Fk i thought they were useless
Damm...i enjoy the comments more then the video...
I can't get over how smart some female mosquitos have evolved to mob the larger elephant mosquito. Like...how did their bug brains even comprehend that this unrelated mosquito is preying on their young? They don't even live long enough to know! Or do they remember from their 'childhood' that the larger elephant larvae were eating their kind...but how do they even know what the adult form of the elepbant mpsquito larvae even look like?!...evolution never ceases to amaze me
They way bro say BABBIIIEESSS😂
Shit tells you a lot a lot of animals can breathe in the water then live on land and breathe air .humans need water to survive and also can breathe under water for decent time But it makes me things was we really mermaids and mermen at a time of evolution
Lol, I work in pest control and I've seen many of these clips before in training videos. Just watched the mouthparts clip two weeks ago.  Better with your narration.
Love the little super villain intros the mosquitos do, these guys know they are about to cause like 20 deaths in their short life spans.
Ze frank I’m not gay but I think I love you. ❤
I don't know what humanity did to deserve ZeFrank, but all I can say is he better stay the fuxk away from stingrays! We can't handle that heartbreak again! 😕 💚💚
I HATE mosquitoes! Next time I'm gonna bring some gorilla super glue to the pond and seal their ass for good.
Hearing Frank say pupa without that uuuuu sound makes it even funnier if you know polish becouse pupa means butt in polish
Yes. Moss-co-wee-toes.
"...butt first- ×cough× but FIRST...' 🤣
5:32 this explains those nights where I couldn't get any sleep in Florida. I remember actually thinking how can these mosquitoes see to bite me? That's how.
Mosquitos, the only thing that's killed more humans than communism. Now that's impressive.
So basically us humans help make mosquito babies by unintentionally giving our blood to female mosquitos which have mated with male mosquitos
Really feels like I’m being watch when the ‘saliva stops the host detecting…’ part comes and right there I saw a mosquito on my arm right away and killed it
I'm new. best narration ever!! I think I'll hang out for a bit..
I do not like misquotes. I'm allergic.
there's a skeeter on your peter!  whack it off!
This is cool but it makes me itchy
"..and is now getting dicked by a skeeter"  Bruh what 🤣💀
Look this is only appropriate for adults, we jumped on it as part of a homeschool fact finding and interesting video. But couldn't  continue to watch because of the language. Sad really as it would really have been Interesting for kids to learn if it weren't for the swearing.
Mosquitos just love me. Until I discovered Skin So Soft by Avon!😎❤
I like natures creatures their all unique and different that’s wat makes them special
Actually the funniest intros to a mosquitoes life
I'm sure your parents are very proud! No I  mean really!!! I Find this stuff hilarious.
I don't care how interesting this was, mosquitos are the worst. elephant mosquitos ftw
Is it just me or does he sound like Morgan Freeman doing a documentary
JAJA saludos desde Costa Rica :)  love it :)
Horrible narrator. Terrible jokes having nothing to do with mosquitoes. More science and less nonsense. You insult the fantastic cinemetography.
4:41 omg 😂😂😂
Kudos to the guy who let the mosquito suck out his blood without flinching.
One time he said boob by mistake! Bwhahahaha!!!!!
Butt first*^-> But first. This skit gets me every time... XD
" Getting dicked by a skeeter " has to be the best sentence I've ever heard!
Hey z man, you make learning fun, with the adult and humerus version of teaching which I enjoy, so my question is, do you know of a tomato worm that fell host to a parasitic wasp. Would like to learn more.
I dont know how you ended up in my feed, but your in my life now. Im dependant. Balls in your court with that statement.
God it annoys me that mosquitos are pollinators
I remember I caught an asshole mosquito alive and unharmed. Then I ripped off it’s proboscis and let it go. Ultimate revenge.
Damn I beginning to use the same pronunciation of bebes you say
I don’t want to grow up, imma toys r us kid. 😅
_oh the joy_    *Thank You, Too, Rachel Morreale and to ALL* for being as Curious as it takes to Learn, not just to bring *Peep Shows for humanus Ocului to Feed upon.*   SO Much More than when we were Kids, .. and still do, tighten our muscle to Watch Mosquito Try to pull it's proboscis, err  Labium;  Labella;  Labrum ... yeah all those +, OUT.  11:37.  lol  it can't.      *Thanks, Ze Frank!*   nice song.  : }
hehe MOS SKWEET OOH - exatly the way I say it to be silly - who on earth put a q in there :)
"It looks like snuffalupagus reamagined as a dildo, wearing glasses."
You can try this in a local pool   don't want this in my search history mixed in with the porn  - it just tool late.   lmfao
That was brilliant.
HATEyhose things so Gross they just fall apart or just dirty??
This shit has the perfect balance between bad jokes and actual knowledge
Traumatized
So basically theres a whole lineage of mosquitos that were made from my blood. So technically I do have children lol.
I love this
I remember visiting Florida when I was a kid in the 1950's. At a motel on our drive towards Florida, we were told we couldn't go swimming in the pool as they had just sprayed oil on top of the water to "control" mosquitoes. Is this method still in use? I assume that the oil would keep the larvae from breathing air, and thus die, but does that even work?
Mosskuhweeetoz...... 🤣
EXTERMINATE!
How does Ze Frank think of this stuff? 😂😂😂😂 when he says “babies” i die
This video is RIDICULOUSLY funny and informative!
It's the "What the fu-" that got me!😂
2:28  So clearly, this means we need to introduce elephant mosquitoes everywhere we can, to get the other species of mosquito under control. (Yes, I'm joking.  Yes, I know how that has typically worked out in the past.)
How can you tell the difference between male and female mossies at sight? Only the females bite anyway.
"Johnston's organ... Grow up.."  No.
Fun fact: The London Underground mosquito does actually feed on human blood
was trying to eat during this   emphasis on the was
Wait a minute, is this the same guy who voiced the llama from that one series
Actually super cool to think that there are mosquitos out there that were born from my blood! I hate mosquitos a little less now that I know some of them are my children. ❤
So I have to wear a tight fitting gas mask and cover myself in med like Arnold in Predator, to avoid getting bitten?
No wonder we can't make mosquitoes go extinct fuck they are another piece of our eco system fuck.
Dengue fever is no joke. I got hit with it while stationed in the Bahama's. Was a lot worse though for the civilian doctor stationed on base. He had received the warning about the mosquito's carrying the virus prevalent in the area and kept the information for himself.
OMG me and my cousin has been feeding a fish because we saw lots small thin fish suddenly appear in the fish bowl and we even bought baby fish food, but when i looked closer the fish bowl i notice it was baby mosquitoes XD
Bakara Surah 26. Ayah
I was watching this video with my daughter she 4 year old and she want to know about mosquito 🦟 and this guy say the F Word. This is not nice.
“Thing about kindergarten is there’s always a biter…”
I have just discovered this channel. I watched the tarantula one first because Im afraid of spiders and it was a random channel. I'm so glad I watched YOUR video on them, it helped so so much that you are the funniest dude I've heard in quite awhile. Thank you so much for existing, and being you. Viva Ze Frank!
If they didn't itch and spread disease I could share my blood
I have learned.. That being eaten butt first is very common, and horrifying. I agree, eat me face first! I love the flamboyant mosquitos XD "HELLO!" - Ze Frank, you're Epic.
Love the Mark Manson reference. Too funny
Killed more people than anything? Man if our Democratic politicians could find a way to capitalize on that we’d all be forced to have our mosquito vaccinations. Ya know…. Cus they care…about our well-being… and it’s never been about control…. Or secret behind the curtain things were not worth to know about…. Mosquitoes
God I'm going to have nightmares....what a disgusting evil animal.  Bring back DDT post haste.
A little bootsy Collins at the end to spice it up a tad
I love how you said "babieees"
“Know your enemie as you know yourself. In one hundred battles you will never be defeated”
Weird commentary, can't tell if serious or dude just talks about his fetishes
Can you an Ode to Vultures
what if instead of trying to eradicate all the mosquitoes to eliminate Malaria we CURE the mosquitoes of carrying the malaria  - mosquito don't want to carry malaria, it makes their livestock sick i bet this would work with the tick/lyme problem too
169k!!!!! Let's celebrate 🥳
I really like how u explain things 🤣🤣
I love letting mosquitoes lay eggs so I can exterminate them
Thank you so much also we have a lot of mosquitoes in our house this is pretty helpful❤
Did anyone else scratch themselves from seeing the mosquito eggs 😭😫
Through this entire episode I found myself itchy
Does that mean I’m actually a father since mosquito behbehs were made with birds of me?
One of the things I hate about these videos....I'm laughing so hard that I miss important information. These are absolutely brilliant...inspite of all the laughing...I've learned a lot...just great.
loved this! hilarious!
I didn’t know I’d be so entertained learning about mosquitoes 🤣
The only thing I can mosquitoes are good for (besides food for other species) is crowd control, since some carry violent pathogens
OMG WHY DID I CLICK THIS VIDEO.
i hate you mosquito! die!!!!!! thanks for the info on my enemy btw!  now die mosquitos!
I don't like Dale... where is Jerry???
The is a mosquito 🦟 that want to meet you that wants to eat yah get to know you yaaah standup...i will be singing this incessantly!!
Its perfectly timed when i laughed its when he said grow up
0:17 Neon Genesis Evangelion
Know your enemy >:)
1:40 okay but the detail on this shot is INSANE
The way he says BAIBEI is so funny omg.
EPIC
Just wish this wasn’t filled with immature trash language.  Interested, but completely turned away by stupidity.
If there are mosquito bebes that are made from parts of me, does that mean I owe thousands of mosquitos child support?
you're a sorry gross man
The fact that the mosquito was in sync with the fu-
"Surely Allah does not shy away from using the parable of a mosquito or what is even smaller. As for the believers, they know that it is the truth from their Lord. And as for the disbelievers, they argue, “What does Allah mean by such a parable?” Through this ˹test˺, He leaves many to stray, and guides many. And He leaves none to stray except the rebellious" Quran 2:26
Dale? Dale?!? I think you should see this - there is something in the water..! No, it's not the dog. Well I don't know what it is Dale! ... describe it? Alright, it looks like snufflopagus but reimagined as a dildo wearing glasses - does that help Dale? No I'm not drunk! Dale, I REALLY think you should  WHAT THE FU
Your telling me I could possibly be the father of some mosquitoes
1) new zefrank1 video notification 2) visit restroom, empty bladder 3) get box of tissue 4) get inhaler 5) laugh so hard I cry 6) laugh so hard if bladder not empty I'd... 7) laugh so hard and long I can no longer breath in on a regular basis, glad I remembered the inhaler because asthma comes next.    8) Worth It!  Thanks, luv u ze
I love how he says babies
Wish learning was this comical
I can't think of one good reason why 'skitters,' exist at all. They are there only to terrorize and torture you with itchy bites.  And then, give you some sickness, virus or pathogen. So they pollenate a few flowers.  Big deal!
This is informative but also made me extremely itchy
I´m here because I told google that I kill mosquitos. But I knew a lot of this already. Fascinating and horryfying, especially the larvae. Also good bait. They are basically good for the ecologic system. Eaten and getting eaten, and also pollinating plants of course. Funny language, and funny jokes. Good video! 5/5, will watch more.  (I only kill those that want to bite me, and when they come at me when I try to fall asleep, that sound...)
I was waiting for him to say "Lezduyet".
3:09 🤣
Honestly learning about mosquitos is so refreshing. They used to freak me out but now I know they're literally just little guys. Our goals conflict (they want my blood, I don't want them to have my blood) but they're still very interesting and deserve to live as much as we do :]
You see a depressed ghost, I see Storm trooper head 😂😂😂
"DEMON ... BABY" ha!
This video is proof that evolution does not take millions of years but rather few days. That fact proves that evolution never happened, otherwise you would have evolved already into much better human but you dont.
Sir your narration is amazing! I am entertain and educated 😂 I'm from Southeast Asia, English isn't my main language but I'm trying so hard to understand every word you say and I enjoy it! Will definitely check out Curiosity Stream but only if you narrate everything hahah
You are the only person that can talk twenty minutes about mosquitoes
Okay, replace Morgan Freeman, and have ZeFrank narrate EVERYTHING
great video zefrank1!
I’m itchy.
youre so funny
All in favour of getting rid of every mosquito that sucks blood and does not pollinates like
So it rained a couple weeks ago and a bucket in my backyard got filled with water and one day I noticed a bunch of tiny little bugs just floating around, had no idea what they were until watching this vid! Nature is crazy man
Entertaining and informative. I Love this channel.
Zefrank teaching much more than all the science hippies.. Wish you were my teacher in high school..
If there was one bug I would like extinct, it would be this one
"the blood drinking variety have to drink blood in order to live"   Yes, you are right. The air on earth is indeed air.
Dude fuck these disgusting little bastards.
As someone who lives in Australia and has stupid high histamine responses to mozzie bites can their cocktail to calm down the "alarm system" work better. Utterly useless. :/
Watching this as I get sucked on by mosquitoes in East Africa
I was eating you bastard lmao😂😂
pimento olives and bagels? Really? You had to ruin two of the best hole'd food didn't you?  Oh, you couldn't have said 'Swiss cheese" or some other semi-food that's gross.  Thanks a lot @zefrank1
Many years ago, I got West Nile from a damned mosquito. It was like having a really bad flu except with nerve damage. After a couple weeks, my fingers and thumbs looked like Michael J Fox. I hate these little bastards.
wow totally entertaining and educational THANK YOU, that's some good humor and learning all in one VERY WELL DONE BRO
3:50 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAH good one
3:11 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA   ZING!!
1:38 HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 🎶🎶💩😲
0:17 holey KRAPP rite off the bat HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
The purpose of mosquitos is a human population growth inhibitor.    And they are very, VERY good at it.
When you speak, I get the impression that you learned to speak English in a descending order of complexity from a far more complex and sophisticated alien language. Like you’re “holding back speed”.    Where are you from again?
I actually didn't know that mosquitoes were pollinators. So they actually do have a purpose, apart from food for other insects and animals.
"it looks like snuffalufagus but reimagined as a dildo, wearing glasses. Does that help, DALE?!"
Those mosquitos coming up out of the water after maturing and spreading their wings really reminds me of vampires standing up and spreading their capes...or Mushu from Mulan going "I'm your worst nightmare"  Seriously I know this video was trying to get the point across that mosquitoes aren't all bad, but that particular species is really not doing itself any favors.
Love your videos. Informative and funny. Awesome 👌
Bebez
The narrator rocks.
Love the sense of humor.
Bless the elephant mosquito not for drinking blood at all 🥲
That outro song lives rent free in my head ever since this episode first came out.
If anyone is curious the unknown bug that was eating the bebes is called a water scorpion. Lol
3:07 In case anybody wanted to know, this is a giant water bug. That is the actual name assigned to it by the science hippies.
The way he says rrrrroof always gets me lmao
Bro that fuckin cut to a frog peeing on another frog got me😂
Awesome video
Ze posts the coolest, freakiest shjt but this is my fave sofaar
This videos are the best i have seen in years
"Hello!!" 🤣🤣🤣 I could watch these all day 🤩
Like one time he said boob by mistake and now everybody makes fun of him had me absolutely dead to rights I can't quit laughing
I just love your videos ❤️ Hysterical !!!!
It was funny. Then he was like Mosquitos eat flowers... I'm furious leave me ALONE MOSQUITOS!!
Thanks for making me itchy
😇😨
dude, Zefrank man, love your vids! they're infomative and the sense of humour rocks! hahaha, i'll never get tired of hearing you saying "babies" either hahaha. Keep up the good work man!
Please come and say "moustache" at parties.
🤔...Just round and round...💯✔️
bebes
I can't believe this video came out over a year ago.
8:24  Just when you thought you’ve seen about everything this pops up on the screen
Wyt...? Could I still be one of the first 200 to receive 20% off the annual "Brilliant" subscription? 🤔 😉😆
9:12 this one cracked me up
Humans are the most intelligent being on earth who watch videos of a larva sucking air from their earth !!!
I LOVE the mosquito song at the end!
I pity the Johnston whose teacher puts this on in class... He'll never hear the end of it! 🤣😆
3:38 this looks like a panda/caterpillar hybrid
Funny Funny Funny how I laughed at how educational this was, thank you for making it so easy to understand mozzies
Kill all mosquitos
I hate myself and am just waiting to die. I have no where constructive to discuss this so I scream into the void of youtube comments.
Its like a well directed documentry i love the quality
"bebes"
Wow. I still have zero sympathy
No. I want them eradicated.
the way the mosquito rose up looked like the most badass villain entrance ever
I'm not going to lie the way you pronounced mosquitoes is the only way I can remember how to spell it. Now I just imagine you saying it
So you're telling me there are mosquitoes with a foot fetish.
The elephant mosquito finishes it's transformation with a Jojo pose
Can I listen to that mosquito song somewhere.
HelloOO
The only creature in the world I will kill, and with pleasure.  A can of hairspray used as a flamethrower is very effective.
I think that’s a toe biter
This is fantastically awesome.  Nothing better on YouTube.
This commentary is grade A lmao😂😂
13:32 I'm a father???
Toxorhynchitis is the best mosquito because it doesn't sting, in case anyone wondered.
I want this guy to narrate everything and my daily life
Talking Chicken.
My son in law used to sing a song to my daughter that is from the Tim and Jerry cartoon. Is You Is, O' Is You Ain't My BehBeh.
Never dreamt a mosquito video could be more enjoyable than a comedy show.
Keep up the great work.
My 9th grade biology teacher showed this to my class 😭
The only fact about the mosquito is that they all need to be torched with flame 🔥 throwers. Facts 💯
2:11 cause it's funny.
hello!!!  lol this was freaking brilliant. elephant mosquito you rule. come eat the bebbies in my backyard.
"...some species, like the Elephant Mosquito, _toxin kitties_ that don't feed on blood at all." -Auto-CC

You got me at the Lady Gaga part . .😂😂😂
That pupa be looking like an AirPod
thank you but this was torture
I never thought I would hear the sentence "Getting dicked by a skeeter"
They are basically Miniature Helicopter.....
Comedy and enormous mosquito life is just a perfect blend.
Trichotrous   so Tric-hot-rous or it sounds like Trick-ought-truss. I think anyway!!
This is easily my most hated organism on the entire planet.  Nothing will sway me on this.
“If you have the thing we’re a bunch of holes freak you out you might want to go”   Well that doesn’t seem too bad….WTF OMG Nooo!!!
3:46 awwwwwwwwwwww poor lil guy!
So glad we're talking about mosquitoes I actually was born up in Alaska and believe it or not they only downside to Alaska's beauty is the mosquitoes. Like during the summertime there are swarms of them they are everywhere in certain places you got to have a lot of mosquito repellent with you at all times.
first rule of war. know thine enemy.
I read somewhere that in Vietnam, there are facilities set up for breeding mosquitos. The eggs are harvested and eaten by the Vietnamese. I think this is absolutely brilliant as the little bastards deserve it. ethermail
I would very very mutch like to hear this in english. The images are magnificient Anfortunately I do not understand the locution
this shit hilarious
Now that behbeh ded behbeh
F**K every mosquito 🖕🏼🤬🖕🏼
Today I learned that elephant mosquito is the best mosquito
i hate these demons from hell...
8:32 How do you spell that species name? I'm trying to find it on google.
Hey zefrank can u talk about turtles and tortoises to see what is the difference between them
U guys are awesome story tellers!!!
I got itchy just watching this.
Behbe
I used to be a biter
The "BEBEZ" is fucking hilarious
"And now it's getting dicked by a skeeter" literally made me choke on my own spit... ffs this guy is funny
Are there any other types of facts beside 'true' ones?
IMO they are not native to this planet!!!
Luv them bay bays
I don't get how they figured all this shit out.. how do they know how the mosquito hunts and make simulator scenarios. Did a mosquito tell anyone how they hunt.
Here I am, watching a 17 minute video of a sarcastic human being talking about mosquitoes. Nice voice btw, do something with it!
wow. always wow
They need to nuke mosquitoe and raccoon state parks in western Pennsylvania
Crab hole aka a brothel
Mosquitoes working so hard to come out of water  Bug zapper:- zaaap!
Ahh almost forgot about this channel! So brilliant! Never laughed this much in a long time. 👏👏
Idk about u all, but when a mosquito is biting me, I feel it. And I slap the shit out of myself aswell.
I can’t tell if I regret watching this or not, I mean I’m basically sitting through all this but it’s like my body is now stiff and uncomfy lol
The mosquito emerging out of the water is like a sentient and malicious movie monster emerging out of it's dark bog water lair. Fucking metal. Definitely using that as inspiration for... i dunno, something. A dnd villain maybe
I love to learn cool stuff while lmao!!!
Your voice is so cool you sound legit and I fooled my girl by having her watch your Big Nose Monkey video and she thought you worked for Nat Geo but was more edgy with your language!!! 😂 LOL 👍
P U P A T E H
5:27 how dare you tell me to "grow up" while u making 15 yrs olds joke😂😂 this sh*t had me in tears🤣🤣🤣
,🤢🤢🤢
Maybe we should get rid of mosquitoes. Genetically altered viruses or sterile mosquitoes to outcompete other mosquitoes
This man needs to narrate an animal documentary series
You're videos are the brightest part of my day😊
All those credits n thank yous...poor Jerry. Not even one mention lol
Holly dear fuck they actually dig around inside your flesh searching for blood flow.. yuck 😂
I truly wish this was in school. So fun. I would have actually learned something lol!
It took me 17 min and 11 seconds to finish my toilet time. It usually takes about 5
One female can lay 200 eggs at once. Never gonna stop mosquitoes. It’s impossible.
😂 you should work for BBC and do their documentaries.
17 min to just watch a mosquito?! I was absolutely glued to this video! Who in the  hell can make a video about misquotes & make it interesting as Fk?! You might be asking yourself.. Well today's is your day!  Because it’s Right Here!! Wow! I loved this presentation of a god damn misquote! ❤❤❤❤
“Dale I really think you shou- WHAT THE FUCK-“
Ppl are very good at k***/ing ppl lmao
this makes me like them jus a little
Fuckin dale
The stress test room in a condom factory 😂😂😂
3:07 looks like a belostomatidae, a.k.a toe biter. Packs hell of a sting.
Fun fact: If you flex a muscle a mosquito is attacking the sudden increase in blood pressure will tear it's head apart
I'm late to the party, I know, but this was freaking hilarious! Thank God you exist!
haha a mosquito just bit me flying off when the jingle at the end started playing and dude you are hilarious I would love to make jingles for your projects I just wanna say your tops like the bees knees ya dig it buz ya later

Yeah, I hate mosquitoes just as much or more than before.
David Attenborough has a worthy successor
And after all of that we go ahead and lightning it to death
OH HEY!  I giant waterbug!!   you need to do a video for those!
The Lady Gaga entrance sent me cuz she actually is dressed like a glammed cockroach for her Chromatica Ball Tour this year lol
So mosquitoes are nonces 😂😂
Fascinating... Doesn't stop me from *slapping the life out of them tho*
I’m not sure why I’ve never come across this Chanel before, but this video’s my first  - it won’t be my last tho, informative + hilarious is hard to get right andthey’ve nailed it!
Genocide them
U could low key still do shrooms lol
The sad thing is weed is the only drug that stays in your system for 30+ days, meanwhile Amphetamine and cocaine sometimes don’t stay longer than seven days after use. I know some drivers that don’t give fuck, and u could tell they fuck with something smoking back to back cigarettes all day
WTH is going on in this sick world, when did so many idiots start swearing, talking trash,  and being gross, and disgusting…while narrating…. It’s not funny, it’s sick, like the culture
I murdered so many of these today. I will very likely murder more tomorrow too.
"Grow up"  HEEEEEEELP HE IS SO FUNNY
zz watching with mosquitos bugging me out
😖😩I’m trying to understand these pests that irritate me and so many others plus they have killed more people than people have killed people! 😩😖
😩I’m itching just watching this video. 😩
One in twenty of these carry deadly pathogens? I should have been dead by age 8, that doesn't seem right
What he sounds like south park. They was an epidsode that shows how lice live and they pronounce it the same way...babaies..
Got atatcked by 6 of these yesterday; killed 5
What mosquitos are good for from what ive heard, is that  they can carry small doses of local diseases and inoculate the one they sucked blood from
Fuck that, I didn't know they turn of your nerves, im taking bugoff with me everywhere now

Inappropriate I thought my kid could watch this
Ill remmeber to keep an eye out for these so i can kill them
It would be great to show to the large younger audience if you did not use foul language.
Sübhanallah...
Years back used to work as a farm hand.  After a week long series of rain storms a section of the farm's front area flooded a bit, had a couple inches of standing water beside the road, it was usually where we parked our cars, didn't pay much attention to it.   Another week passes and the water is still there, but now it has the single largest collection of mosquito larva I had ever seen in it.  Thousands of them, the water was *black* and constantly in motion from them, it was a terrifying amount and I was a little taken aback that the boss hasn't had us do anything about them.  So I go and ask him if he knows what they are.    He says, "they're some kind of bug, its no big deal." "Those are mosquito larva."  "...  It's going to kill the hell out of that patch of dirt, but I want you to dump half a gallon of bleach into that water." " *YOU GOT IT, BOSS.* "   I then had to dig a new drainage ditch.  The moral of the story is always pay attention to areas of stagnant water in or around your property so you don't have go Scorched Earth on these bastards.
omg you need to get your own Netflix documentary show!!! I'd watch it everyday
#unbanRumble
Your content is interesting Thanks for sharing us
Love the 'squito house music, lol 😉
If you’re going to eat me… eat me face first
Where have you been all my like 😂😂😂 I needed this

0:58 the forbidden corn
getting bit by a mosquito while watching this
Omg I thought Lady Gaga from the beginning. Lol
What happened to Jerry?
Ah… the long awaited follow-up single to This Puffin’s Got Some Stuffin’! Finally!!!
I'm so pleased with your success. You're a delight! :)
The Lady Gaga comment just killed me! Thanks for making science fun.
While this is all very interesting, I would have preferred the cameraman to have killed it rather than filming it.
This is the Teddy has an operation guy??? Holy shit
Itch inducing 😖
Fun fact: the poles on bumper cars are called wands. They're paired with a metal brush on the bottom that contacts the floor to complete the circuit to power the car.
"And now it's getting dicked by a squitter"  This is the best thing I've ever heard
That’s the thing about kindergarten, there’s always a biter!
love the narration😄
This channel is fn great
mosquitos make me wan't to commit genocide of all useless bugs
So ur saying there are thousands of moisquito children in existence that might have been mine. 🥲
....."and now shes being dicked by a skeeter"🤣
Bro this narrator is Legendary 🤣💀
3:14 is a water beatle, and they can get very big.
nice content!
your videos are so fantastic, funny and educational. Fav youtuber in my opinion. keep up the good work u sick funny fuck. Shoutout to Gerry. Gota buy that guy a beer sometime
there would be nothing more satisfying then to jsut squach thath nest and save like 50 people from malaria
HELLOOOO!
"I want to suck on them little toes like candy."  A mosquito
Make a horror movie out of this.
In fairness that chicken was gonna be salty one way or the other
No one teaches nature like Zefrank1!  🤣
Looks like Jack skeleton xD as a flying elephant
I just wish it was less stand up commedy
Behbehs
The greatest plague ever...
Guess everything smells like shit?
I just killed a mosquito at the credits part... death to mosquitos!
*D E M O N  B E H B E H*
I can't possibly be the only one who was laughing inwardly at the "Johnston's organ" joke and lost it completely with the "oh grow up"  bit?!😂😂😂. Brilliant 😎.
“HEELLOOO”
love your videos!!!!
Welp, I'm gonna have nightmares
When I see these things and realize they dominated the planet for a long time, I wouldn’t be surprised if aliens largely resemble insects, which is why they don’t make friends with us (we would freak out and attack on instinct even if we are warned and prepared)
You completely opened my eyes to the fact that mosquito's DO have a purpose! I didn't know they are pollinators!
"If you have that thing where you're freaked out by holes" you mean everyone in the YouTube comment section? 🤣  Oh no that means me 😰
They should be exterminated. What niche do they fill? Them, along with tapeworms need to be annihilated for the good of the Imperium of Man
If the BUTT stops working, YOU stop living! The gut in humans involves ALL body systems to some point. Imagine it is the same in many animals, especially mammals in general and more specifically,  primates? Where would all that waste go without a BUTT?
The quran claims the mosquito is the most dangrous creature
This commentary is really getting my goat 🤣
"Just jackknife under the water, let your butt breach, and spread 'em, then blow out your mouth real hard" good lord this had to business making me laugh as hard as it did
The clip of the mosquito landing on a flamingo's eye lasted way too long mate
"It's like how Lady Gaga would come on stage" absolutely wrecked me
Elephant mosquito is best mosquito
Ashame John McAfee isn't the narrator...
These larvae transformations are like Pokemon. If their evolution process didn't skip the work shaping in between.
2:11
*demon babies*
"gettin' dicked by a 'skeeter" made me choke on my bloodmeal.
If they detect stuff in the dark why are they constantly bumping into stuff?
Thanks for the laughs
Zefrank, you're funny, but I'll never forgive you for Buzzfeed.
The scripts… I swear. Amazing. I hope somewhere there is a teacher wise enough to use these in teaching.
so youre saying i have probably thousands of mosquito siblings?
awesome
So how do we make them go extinct?
Not even 2 mins in LMFAO OMFG 🤣 😂 💀 😭 😆 @5: mins in Johnstons organ
'know what? I'mma sub.
😅😅😅😅  Baybez..
ITCHY
HELLOOO!!! 😁
It's 3 in the fucking morning and I just found one of the best channels on youtube. I'm definitely not sleeping tonight.
lmao i was acutally holding my breath and got called out
narrator is super lame, dislike
3:08 Nepa insect. Commonly called as "water scorpion".
AAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!! I can't stop visualising Albert Wesker doing this documentary!! 😭😆
I have to pause these videos to drink water.
I never knew that watching the life cycle of a mosquito could be so much fun! Thank you!!!!
I just got tired of how zefrank pronounces "Mosquito
Pewpa
I live by a woods. But also across the street is a massive tire place. You can't go out and enjoy the outside at all. They're always out and they love me. Little shits.
DEET, permethin, mosquito dunks,
Ok, Zefrank, what's with the funky endcards. You gotta release these songs, man!
True Facts: behbehs :)
That was hilarious and informative. Well done!
You're the best biology youtuber ibe ever watched
B E B E S
Babies 😭🥺💖
You rock my socks... Thank you
Those white legged ones are vicious for sure
Very good video, but it  didn't explain sufficiently how to best kill the little b*****ds in my room
3:08 You should see it take down a snake! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjRoGyRE5z0
Mosquito Song, hel LO!
You are funny lol 😂
If you have standing water then you have mosquitoes at least in Michigan
Take a shot every time he says babies
Evil evil mosquito...
Dude.. Don't EVER stop making these videos! EVER!!
Guess we better go infest the place with elephant mosquitoes then. They're awesome!!! The moms go Deploy!
6:39 HELLO 💅
better than school biology lesson
i swear to god the HELLOOOOO had me in tears on the floor laughing
I like how that one you said was like lady gaga was like a woman teleporting into another place lmfao
Yeah
So glad I clicked to watch a random suggested video - good job YT You are bloody hilarious my dude! I love it
Dicked by a skeeter!
"ask a chicken what people are good for" is unironically a really cool and funny way to get people to understand why antrhrocentrism should be avoided
The commentary about how they break from their underwater exoskeleton to the world absolutely sent me. 💀
Commenting
Thanks!
My  dream is one day scientists invent a protein, hammerless to humans that we can inject ourselves with or intake in a form of pills, but absolutely deadly for mosquitoes, a protein that dissolves their insides after feeding on our blood so they "learn" to leaves us humans alone.
Now my skin is crawling….  Thanks… lol
I started laughing so hard at the beginning I had to stop the video for 5 mins til my eyes were clear enough!😂😂😂😂😂
“Poopatay” sorry , pupate 😂
*Scratching my multitudes of mosquito bites as I watch this*
Nothing gives me greater joy than the fact that I am very sensitive to mosquitoes when they bite, so I almost always manage to kill it.
Most underrated line :...."there's a little leakage, other than that its fine!" hysterical.
12:23 that skeeter just took a juicy dump, RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME!
What an amazing video
This is hands down my favorite intro of all your videos
Fuck mosquitoes
Now I hate mosquitoes even more.
kinda weird that this channel hasnt been getting recomended as much lately and so the views have went down from what this has and others, to under a quarter of a million. whats going on? is it cuz youtube is actively not promoting channels that dont do shorts like the scumbags they are? (i dont know if this channel doesnt do shorts, im just guessing it doesnt)
the voiceover is like if Bobby Duke taught...well, this.
Mus-quit-o gotta kill em all
So here am I 3 o clock at night after fighting for hours w these little bastards
@maplecolor1 - he’s doing just fine without you. Go pound sand.
There are a fuckton of mosquito eggs containing my DNA? Damn wonder how much child support that is.
I don't ever want to be bit again... oooh icky icky. Really educational but ooooooh
That's why I can't get mosquitos to enter extinction. They eat from flowers instead of just trying to steal our food.
I’ve been bitten 8 times in 10 minutes, I think I’ve upset the mosquito government, did I kill a mosquito president?
someone needs to mass breed elephant mosquitoes so we can rid the planet of all mosquitoes. fuck mosquitoes
Laughed way too hard at the depressed ghost joke
He always has me at 'Behbeh'. That's all it takes. Behbehs....
Me: "man nobody's ever gonna replace Sir Dave for wildlife docs"  this video: "he looks like a depressed ghost who said boob by accident one time"  I was wrong
Wait so only female mosquitoes drink blood?
The mosquito song made my night thank you
HELLO!!!!!!!!!
I have to have like mosquitophobia cause I was uncomfortable the whole video and ended it sweating...fuck i hate them
Why!...is the commentary soooo perverted?!? Jesus Christ.
Lady GaGa - perfect analogy 4:30 -
This guy is hilarious
The real life Dbz Cell 🦟
Please. Do not refer to anything that sucks blood as beautiful....leeches, mosquitoes, Democrats...they are all monsters!
Thank you for doing the most creepy and off-putting research and making it funny. Every time I see a creature that I wish would not become radioactive mutants, I will kill. Lol.
You sir are funny as f*ck! Subbed after 1min babbiee!!
Oh this is too funny and educational at the same time. :-) definitely a subscriber now. :-) :-)
Very well scripted!
People are pretty good for chickens, we keep them safe, we build them homes and made them one of the most numerous birds on the planet. Yeah we eat them but we make sure they are guaranteed to perform their most important role in life, reproducing their genes in the form of offspring by the billions.
I love this still its been like a year or 2 since I started watching these and I discovered it accidentally on a road trip and my mom enjoys it too all of it,she thinks it's all really funny,she doesnt even say anything about the language,because of the way its expressed.We're both adults it's just how she's always been but ya she loves it.
Demented
NOT YOU ATTACKING ME FOR TRYPOPHOBIA LMAO
I wish this guy would release a new video every day!! He is so good!! I laugh out loud,  so funny
The song at the end 😂🤣😭 should be on the top 10 charts 👏
As of recently I started sparying mosquito bites with 99% alcohol sanitizer 😐
10:09 if you have blood you're getting bit 😂😭
9:52 LMAO 🤣
2:43 LMAO 🤣
This guy should make a good morgen freeman voice over 😂
This sounds like Gus Fring was a voice actor before buying Pollos Hermanos.
Where is zefranks netflix series?
Thank you very much for interesting story about mosquitos. Insects are incredible.
Knowledge is cursed
Wow, I totally enjoyed this!!
never thought i'd add "favorite species of mosquito" onto the list of things i have
Buttfirst
3:11 giant toe Biter, hate them. Also apparently there bite REALLY hurts.
Grow up.  Loooool
Oh is that why they love biting feet haha.    This is awesome commentary haha love it
She took the kids and ran 😔😔🦟🦟
that intro killed me lol
Its a pity that there is so much sexual references - my children would love to watch these videos .
Oh my gawd! This is my new FAVORITE channel! I am ROLLIN! The narration is brilliant! So so funny!! Thanks my guy, got my vote for the best, most funniest an knowledgeable channel yet! Thanks dude, great job!! 😎❤️🤣
Can't wait for these fuckers to be extinct. Nearly as bad as ticks.
Put out an album Ze! I love your tunes brother!
0:55 When I drink tequila, I pronounce it that whey. 🤪
Just kill off all the ones that drink blood, the rest are fine.
Cause chickens are decent ppl- G Carlin. The mosquito is curtis mayfeild superfly funk of 76 mod squad mos def. I kiss you.
I am so conflicted because I started watching your series for the off-humour, but you've actually added a lot of really incredible footage and facts, which are honestly fascinating.  By conflicted I mean I used to watch these to laugh hysterically, but now I also have to pay attention to learn things I didn't know!  Please keep up the amazing work, I'm looking forward to showing these to my kids when they grow up.. in like ten years and understand cursing :)
dale? did someone let someone else into his head?
Why show the fucking holes unblurred and then after you finish your shitty little joke, say "oh hey there's something triggering on-screen".
Mosquitos make me scared of what aliens might end up being.
Great comedy commentary
those little monsters are always going for my ankles. it makes sense now.
2:11 Demon Baby
Omg this is fucking hilarious.
Demon Bebie!
I love your pedophilic homosexual innuendo
I'll never look at these bastards the same way.
Human blood being harvested to turn into mosquito babies is the most mortifying sentence i've ever heard
I watch this in hope of finding their weaknesses,my familly wont allow me to burn them with a flamethrower and chemical warfare is expensive
You make life a little brighter. Thanks for what you do. :)
"Start with my face if you eat me" :D :D
All I wanted is to sleep....in.... *PEACE*
People saying mosquitoes are the worst have obviously never tried going for a walk in Minnesota during deerfly season.
Until now, my favorite nature narrator has been David Attenborough…
Mosquito song is now my ringtone, thank you ;)
Bebies
"Like straining soup through a moustěăsh"
Eww.
The bebe's.  🇫🇷 :)
Excellent content with  clear explanations. I learned more about mosquitoes in less than a quarter of an hour than I had ever learned. Thank you. Subscribed.
🤣🤣🤣🤣💯💯💯💯the song this guy man, HELLO 🤣
I feel SO MUCH BETTER knowing that these little bastards have other tinier bastards chewing on them, too! I’d like to see a mosquito get bitten by another mosquito -_-
Does anyone know where/how they get the footage for these videos? Lol
You may also check this weird and amazing facts.  https://youtu.be/-erZZzg9F98  Please Like, Share, Subscribe and support my channel. Thank you!
The most foul corn cob.
I had no idea mosquitoes were pollinators. It makes me hate them a bit less.
The engineering that we humans can learn from these creatures
gotta love elephant mosquitoes
10:50 Attracted to the smell of feet 😂😂
4:40 General Kenobi
Give me my organ back
Every day I wake up grateful I live in a desert and not a jungle.
im 23 seconds in...pausing AGAIN to lmgdfao. thumbs bells and subs. lets get drunk together soon!
3:07 that looks like a toe biter. they're called that for a reason.
"and now its getting dicked by a skeeter" insane sentence
If there's another Filipino comes around, there's the age old question answered. "Nilalamok din ba ang lamok?" 10:09
The mystery nymph is a Giant Water Beetle. You're welcome.😈
13:33 so what i got from this is that i could be a mom to some mosquitos out there? theres a "my dad left me" joke in here somewhere but youre telling me im in lesbians with some randomass mosquito and we have kids... damn. i dont want taken to court over child support for this
he-LOOOOO XD
I love how he says babies Lmaoo
now that bebe dead bebe
Things start breathing butt first...and get eaten butt first
I appreciate Ze's warning to us trypophobes, but it could have come a few seconds earlier! 🙏
"Butt first..sorry but first" always makes me giggle
it felt like my whole body was itching while watching this.
The way this man talks im crying 😭😭😭😭
I heard that there wouldn't be nearly as much damage to the ecosystem (if any at all) by the extinction of ticks as there would by the extinction of mosquitoes. Of course, if we just make the ones that carry human pathogens extinct...
I can't stop watching this! 🤣
Ah yes nature's worst practical joke
Stupid humor
I laughed at the Johnston's organ part
This narrator is hilarious!
Wait what are the little rafts for?!
We need to genetically modify mosquitoes to make them infertile
Fun Fact, Maybe : A mosquito can fly, but a fly can not mosquito.
The Lord in His wisdom made the fly, and then forgot to tell us why. - Ogden Nash
The mosquito buzzing around in my room found this quite entertaining.
As a mosquito magnet, and biological scientist, and long time FAN, this was fantastic. Although "Sea Horse" will probably always remain my favorite. Just sayin.
Those pupae look like the creatures in the old sci-fi/horror movie "Fiends without a Face." And they truly are fiends.
What fly larvae is at 2:50 ? The fly Chia boris? Tried googling a couple different spellings but can't find it.
Now i cant kill mosquitos without feeling like im killing nature, as they pollenate! Dang it
I could be wrong but I’m pretty sure that bug you didn’t know is a giant water bug! That also breathes through their butt 😏😂
I'm not feeling bad anymore for not making it to the gym today. The facial gymnastics and muscle tension I experienced with this video is absolutely sufficient
Somebody put Partition over 0:11
ayo does no one appreciate the mfs who have to get bit for research purposes ..... respect to my legends
"Dale, I think you really should- WHAT THE FU—"
As a mosquito, this is very accurate.
Greatest narration I've ever heard lol
The misquito song! Hell-OOOO
👋This most entertaining delightfully twisted take and extremely educational video on  “Moosekeettoes” proves everything has a purpose no matter how much we may try to deny them or keep our heads in the sand.  (Sand fly story is available?!) ✌️🥳😉
I learned what a red rocket was from his videos!
Fun fact:only female mosquitos drink blood The males drink nectar
2:55 "Now that bebe dead bebe"
Thanks for the tryptophobia trigger warning AFTER you showed the holes. Nobody believes me that it actually freaks me out
While you're on the blood sucking Splash feast you should also do vampire bats too... Let's hear about those suck heads I want their capable of doing and spreading from humans to animals!
"Dale, Dale i think you should see this there's something in the water. no its not the dog. well i dont know what it is dale, describe it? all right, it looks like snufflopagus but reimagined as a ---- wearing glasses does that help dale? no i'm not drunk dale I really think you should- WHAT THE FU-"   the best moment at the very beginning its too funny X,D
Thanks for the earbud analogy
I've endevered a convolsive swim. I don't do that though
That is how the mossie do
How have I managed to reach today years old without finding this channel. I haven’t laughed this much in years. How sad for me.
What's the name of that fly larvae with the can opener mouth at 2:52?
The mosquito and wasp can both F right off for eternity.
butt first...nice
Demon bebeh.
I have mosquito box now. 🙈
The swirly bits of air are called Eddie currents
hated this sm i hate mosquitos even more now :(((((((
as a mosquito i assure you that this is real
Chicken always tell you when they lay an egg. Trust me, i have a window towards the chicken garden.
Im watching this so I can use it in grounded
Who drop their eyelashes??????
I think I fainted for some minutes at the egg hatching part
"Pictured here with a match so you can get an idea of how hard it is for *them* to pick up a smoking habit--"  Maybe I should have been a mosquito cause then I could never have started smoking
To the tune of "She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain" 🎤 There's a skeeter on my peter, whack it off (whack it off) There's a skeeter on my peter whack it off (Whack it off) There's a dozen on his cousin, you can hear them bastards buzzin There's a skeeter on my peter whack it off. (Whack it off.)
Today, I learned that Lady Gaga breathed through her butt parts before she poopated. This explains a lot.
TL;DR: Elephant Mosquitoes.
Some of the greatest work I've seen. You're a twisted human. Thanks for sharing.
One thing I've learned is that we all have mosquitoes babies
Ze : "They look like those poles that connect bumper cars to the roof" Me : "indeed" 🤔
lmao you so need to do stand up comedy you sir are hilarious !
It's hard to take something serious when the first thing you hear is a curse word or something suggesting it and someone talking like a stupid moron! Dude you may be accurate but the presentation is pathetic and uncalled for. Shame.
This is by far the best thing I've seen on youtube in a long time
If BBC earth would make memes, they were like this. Love it!
6:00 mainly from the *BLOOD OF AMERICANS!!!!!!*
tipples deserve an episode for themselves.... seriously, how do they live?
Was anyone else itchy watching this 😂
In just a in few minutes, elephant mosquitoes made it to my best creatures list.
ive just now realized those weird looking fishing lures are supposed to be replicating mosquito larvae
"With the lights out, eating's less dangerous. Here we are now, in containers... Lady mosquito, my libido, ja!"
!!! "Watch out he's a butt breather", <==r something I never want to hear when I go to the pool!!!
why did god made mosqitos
Mosquitoes... emissaries from hell that have killed more humans than any other creature, bite and annoy humans all over and spread diseases and causes marks that itch for nearly an hour.  They couldn't possibly be more evil.   *Some species of male mosquitoes mate with a female the moment she is born*   Demons....
"Air enters the siphon and into a series of tubes..." So, the internet...?
Omg 😄😂
8:15
That was very informative. Thanks. I hated it.
"bebbies" Fuck, that's killing me and I got 14 minutes to go
Or a depressed storm trooper!!
I admit I did hold my breath, but sadly I'm always getting swarm
That thing you don't know what is is a Hemiptera of the family Belostomatidae! It's also called a "toe biter". They're in the same order (Hemiptera) as water skaters and stink bugs. They eat by using their "beaks" to  puncture and slurp up what they catch, and all the aquatic varieties are predators.  Dr. Sally Entrekin at Virginia Tech is super nice and I bet she'd be happy to talk to you about all the aquatic insects!
Fasinating yet I am itching the whole time
That voice is gaymaker
This is the video where I learned how to pronounce Ze Frank.
DEMON BEBY! I love this channel!
DUDE!!! You owe me a new iPad damaged by beer spit! The first 27 seconds…DUDE!!! Oh, you also owe me a beer!
That frog scene got me 🤣
Readying limited edition boring flamethrower
Right there, right above the pooper
https://youtu.be/IwIsrhUncD8 I think someone is copying part of your videos to profit if this isn’t you reposting you need to copyright strike it
You kinda just skimmed right over the fact that mosquito eggs can be dried out and stored until activated by moisture, like plant seeds. That's fucking cool
There are mosquitoes out there made from bits of you  Me:
language...
The last mosquito to bite me had to check into Betty Ford.
Skeeter on my peter, wack it off . Makes me laugh
I would like to know the situation where you're supposed to eat and defecate at the same time 😂
Damn it why is this video making me feel itchy all over
80s Egypti, also known as The Bengles.
How do they breath without lungs? Only Rhipidistia has lungs which developed way after the arthropod split from that line
Mosquito about to get blood.  mosquito mouth parts: "kowalsky analysis!"
lowkey sounds like guz from breaking bad
Oh, wait...
_”DEMON BEBE”_
When I was in the artic circle in Northern Alaska in the summer a few years ago, each of us had our own cloud of monstrously sized mosquitos following us half a second behind us. We couldn't stop moving or we'd be overtaken, and I now know why mosquitos are Alaska's unofficial state bird.
This video made me itch, all over.
Okay fck them but i have a serious question. Why do these mf always always always goes for parts that not within our eye sight? 😒 i have noticed this a thousand times. Like behind our neck, foot, back arm, anywhere that is not within our vision. The most holy example is, when u spot one near u. Just move ur eye balls and theyll fly the fck off right before i move any other muscles or dont even move ur eye balls. Just concentrate onto them and they still fly the fck off. I live in SEA, and yes, i know these dirty little bs. Do they dectect vision somehow 🤔 or this has to do with a whole bigger concept which our eyes only receive lightwave as images? Maybe our eyes project some waves too and they detect those waves and intentionally avoids those waves thus only goes for parts that is not within our sight?
how do i warn people that this video isnt one of those yt vids that you need to watch while eating...
I learned everything butt how to get rid of them! Help!!!
2:10 had me rolling lmaooooo
Mosquito 1 vs human 0
Thanks I hate everything about this but it was enjoyable to watch
I laugh so much during these. Thank you.
Of all the available episodes i had no idea I would find this one so absolutely fascinating. The sense of humour is brilliant 🙂
One time I swatted a mosquito, and it exploded on my arm. I had who-knows what’s-blood all over my arm.   I threw up.
Damn, NatGeo photographers have NOTHing on your Mr. Pleyer.  Best macro work I've ever seen...
Nice. But I still hate mosquitoes.
That was the hit of dopamine I needed.  These are just brilliant. They never get old!
I will never say the words “mosquito “ “babies” or “butt” everrrr again.
The mosquito laying the eggs that look banana shaped is so cool, I love how it keeps the egg in the same orientation after ejecting it.
What have I learnt? Elephant mosquitoes best mosquitoes.
Great video, but the language is a nuisance. 🤷🏽‍♀️
You’re my new favorite YouTuber. Ashamed I hadn’t found you earlier
I was drinking water when he said “like those poles that attach bumper cars to the rrroooooff!” And I spit it everywhere
The bibliography at the end warms my heart in an age disinformation
DEATH TO MOSQUITOES
This is literally the reaction of any alien ever witnessing the birth process of any of earths insects 0:07
know thine enemy
I thought I was the only one where :“a bunch of little holes freaks you out” Is there a name for this phenomenon? Why is it all these little holes are so disgusting? Anyone got an answer?
The way ze says moscoito makes me so joyful
I’m surprised he didn’t mention what causes the mosquito bite to itch
Everything about this video makes me itch...
I love watching these but my name is Jerry and I feel attacked
So the mosquitoes find me by seeking out the carbon dioxide I exhale? Eureka! I'll just start the car and run a hose from the exhaust pipe into my room. If I fill the whole room with carbon dioxide while I'm asleep, the mosquitoes won't be able to find me!
My wife just caught me slapping and scratching while watching this video lol she's like dude the video is giving you mosquito PTSD change it
So, mosquitoes are nasty, biting butt breathers. Not bad work if you can get it.
I know I don’t say this enough but I love you
god that first minute triggered me so much dear lord
Man u make the best docos ur so funny I love all ur vids
I Never Really Thought Mosquitos Sucked, And Useless, Just Annoying, They Also Look Real Cool
Bruh. I laughed so hard on the small organ joke. I died when he said, "Grow up". 😆
"Looks like a Snuffleupagus, but reimagined as a dildo wearing glasses"   LMAO 🤣🤣
2:25  Looks like the game Spore, in the bacteria/tiny bug state  Edit: More like 2:17
I dont know but everytime he said baby it sound "bebe" makes me wanna watch more.
If I recall, there is a mosquito species that has two different variants, One that sucks blood and another that doesn't, and I am not talking about male and female. The non-blood-sucky variant shuns blood even when offered it.
D e m o n   B a b y
amazing, beautiful, hilarious. I like mosquitos now!
The way they hang themselves from the surface tension is cool. The little bast4rds
Does be have a tick movie yet. Cuz I might be a little sympathetic
WOW!!! Just… thank you for this.
This is the most hilarious nature show I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂
I’ve never learned soo much while laughing soo hard
"Hellooo" Had me rollin"!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
I really enjoy everything about this site. What makes it even better is the sense of humorous this guy has. He is hilarious. Please keep them coming.
worlds most worst living being is mosquito.
Great.  Now I hate mosquitos even more than I already have.
3:07 Water Scorpion
Siiiiiccckkk
this is the best channel lol ... presenting these videos about the different life forms out there in an absolutely hilarious way is the best
"A shrimpy, curled up sort of thing that looks like a depressed ghost" Oops, I think one of my pics must've gotten mixed in with the mosquitoes' pics, sorry!
Ok, I just spent 17 minutes scratching an imaginary itch on my arms while watching this.  Dammit.
I love how I was still giggling at the most immature joke and he told me to grow up🤣🤣how’d you knoow 😭😂
“Filter feeding” sounds suspiciously similar, in action, to “midnight grazing” for late night munchers.
I wonder if the one's attracted to humans are attracted to the females by the sound of female wings? Gives me an idea for a skeeter zapper lol
10:40 great. just gonna stop breathing Xddd
this video made me so itchy
Butt snorkels? ...ok then.
Trypophobes fled downward long before the verbal warning began.
Mosquitos would be so much more rescpectable if they just sticked to drinking flower juice. They would be like bees but ugly!
Keep it coming
Gd aliens
To the trucker who showed me this channel  its been a while do come back
yeah no he really does do it better...
Dude you are awesome!
So can we agree that elephant mosquitos are the most based mosquito
The is really good haha
Bebes
Pupa form looks like Gorb
This was a PERFECT episode of True Facts. So amazing and funny at the same time. Thanks, Ze! ~Trav
They use me to make behbehs. I want them to pay their damn child support.
"Bebes.."
2:11-2:12
0:54 Moscowito
This was horrifyingly interesting. I hate them, but now how a new respect for how advanced their life is, in a way. Actually gives me even more of a reason to hunt the ones that are trying to bite me.
You are the best. Hands down. Or mosquito butts up, whatever. Best.
So your telling me that I'm a father. I didn't consent i could also be mosquito grandfather! AAAHHH!
You so funny😝 Very enjoyable learning!  You have turned a joke into a gold mine. .
2:44 "and that's the thing about kindergarten, there's always a biter." Yep, fk them lil goblins. I could talk fairly early on so in day care it's like it attracted the little mongoloid biter goblins to come bite me because they were too stupid to make words like a normal human being... "oh I can't make words like a normal well adjusted human so I guess I'll just bite tf out of those who can like I'm some sort of stupid monkey child."
After watching this mosquitoes are no longer on my "kill on sight" list... they get a chance to live
You make me laugh.  You're voice is like soul candy. (Not candy corn) like grandma's homemade cookies.
When I need a pick-me-up I just cue this video and it works EVERY TIME! 🥰🥰🥰
more vids pplleeaaseeee
This video alone just makes me itchy,  lol.
The other thing eating the larva was a giant water bug.
This might be the most disgusting video I have ever seen, and I studied this type of shit. Only with this narrator could I have sat through that. Thanks?
Only Zefrank could describe mosquitoes in an entertaining way! And all those pollinating mosquitoes don't make up for the ones that come after me. Zebra mosquitoes are the worst! Fortunately, there is justice when I can slap one dead who just filled up on me!
Elephant mosquitos are pog, kills other mosquitoes, pollinates, and don’t drink blood
I hate mosquitoes so much. I hated them before but now I hate them in more detail.  😒🦟
The bebey!!! I can’t stop laughing!!!
Here come the bebbehs
Thanks for educating people about mosquitoes and clearing up some things about them.... It's interesting and funny and I hope you continue videos about more animals that the majority of people don't like.
"Johnston's Organ, named after Johnston, who must've had a tiny organ. Johnston's organ can sense the slightest movement (giggles) grow up"  That had me rolling 💀😭💀💀
Me and my girlfriend only refer to babies as babahs
very interesting content, with hilarious commentary. very refreshing compared to regular documentary about nature!! im also impressed with the fact that i learned so much about different "common" animals i previously considered known and uninteresting.  big like.  please do more!
A baby is now a dead baby 💀 😂😂😂😂😂 had me rolling
Lmao! Demon Baby!😈😆
This channel is so fun and informative lmbo🤣🤩😍❤
That boob joke made me laugh out loud. I'm at work and it was good and quiet, than you just hear me laughing.  It made me uncomfortable.
Some frogs pay a lot of money for that, just saying😉😉
Ok. You're growing. I looked at your delivery as having a comedic niche value. After a couple of years. I still think that.
this is quickly becoming one of my favourite nature channels
Here for the Mosquito Song.
Their saliva doesn’t work on me unless it’s my legs, but I can literally feel them push that probe in the skin
Love how you make education and breathing threw your butt fun!
The commentary is priceless.  It makes me wants to learn about things I never thought I wanted to know. Thank you for the laughter. I couldjust listen to him say Bay bays over and over again.:)
This made me itch on my forehead.
This is the only YouTube channel that makes me not want to miss the ads
HELLOOOO!  XD
Hey! I also have a YouTube channel related to invertebrates and other animals!!!  Feel free to subscribe: youtube.com/absecreatureverse
The commentator is verbally creative.
It looks like the green goblin ascending
Found this in my recommended videos 😁 That was fun, subbed, 👍 and 🔔 😊
🤣🤣🤣 education at its finest ❤️🖤❤️
How we love zefrank, let us count the ways! First most, the hilarious way he sees the seemingly mundane world around us which we discover through the microscope is not mundane at all. Second, the always fascinating topics he brings to each and every new episode really are worth watching if you are interested in the natural world. Third, his voice is just so very wonderful for this type of content which we are used to being brought to us by more staid and starched voices, often with British accents that would never dare to utter the perfectly profane sentences that zefrank excels at and that we so very much love. Fourth, our hero of the microcosm really knows his stuff and so it all comes out so easily that it makes learning the rather intricate minutiae of this world quite enjoyable and worth watching all the way to the end. In fact, I can’t imagine anyone being able to not watch the entire episode once they have gotten past the opening lines of zefrank’s presentation. Each and every episode is a gem, there are no duds, everything works, it never gets old and I could go on and on. But I won’t.  I’ll just say “ Thank you, zefrank!” and be on my way, made much merrier by stopping to watch one of your masterpieces.
There are certain aspects of this critters anatomy AND behavior that are very similar to the hummingbird- who has the knowledge to connect those dots?
science is half people getting other people to agree that they've solved a puzzle correctly when they haven't.
“Depressed ghost” 🤣😂 💀 ☠️
i never new mosquitos had tentacles this channel is great
"Butt first.."    If only you had been my science teacher, I might have made something of myself...
This is why we dump gallons of used motor oil in the pond
Brilliant narration !!! Bringing humour into is just a great way to retain the knowledge 👍👍🤣🤣
It's not the way it used to be at the beginning, I can't watch them anymore
there's a skeeter on my peter nock it off there's a dozen on my chosen nock it off.3/3/2022. from Michigan USA. 6:45 PM
I thought this couldn't get funnier after the frog peeing on another til you mentioned the ear bud getting "dicked  by a mosquito."😂😂😂
I was scared to see this video of very close up view of mosquitos and their eyes. But I forgot to think about their eggs. From the start, damn..
3:07 giant water bug
Watching this video makes me itch something fierce.
I laughed like crazy.
Scientism has turned into a cult. They sit around making shit up and cosigning eachother's BS and if they don't say what they're told to say they don't get funding. Double and triple check everything we've ever been taught. Most of it is wrong and that's on purpose.
"Gettin' dicked by a skeeter" hahahahahaha thank you. Would love to hear you talk about june bugs lol
Horrible narration. Lasted 2 minutes.
👍
Never imagined I’d find such a funny video about Politicians…
Holy fuckin shit I just discovered this channel, I have been doing comedic commentary for my family for years and am considered quite funny. But the commentary on these videos is fucking hilarious... been binging for a couple hours now and can't stop laughing. Fantastic, keep it up I'm definitely looking forward to sharing your channel
I truly enjoyed laughing at this True Facts! Oh how I loathe mosquitoes now matter how fascinating their life cycle! Bebes!
2:08
I freaking love this, all of these bring a smile to my face and a chuckle to my belly. Thank you, we need it.
🤣 Oh God, I love it so much. It's so funny! This is by far the best way to learn things!
Where do they go for the winter in 4 season countries? How do they survive the freezing weather? Do only eggs survive or do mosquitoes also survive winter? What triggers their reanimation in spring?
The narrator's attemps to be jovial really suck, and destroy an otherwise interesting video.  The voice is so annoying I can't watch.
11:40 I don't feel bad about pulling out the mouth parts anymore.
Spoiled by the juvenile narration
As a Minnesota resident who enjoys the outdoors, I think I speak for most of us when I say that mosquitos suck.
Getting dicked by a skitter never thought I'd laugh so hard
gene drives!!!!!
Those better not be from the genus Aedes...  Those are the ones who carry the shit that fucks us up. Dengue Fever, Yellow Fever, not Malaria since that parasite targets Anopheles mosquitoes, West Nile, and that one from Southeast Asia that screws up newborns of preggo women
That is a toe biter
It is at least comforting to know that they are just as detestable as babies as they are as adults
...Bebbaize...
Hello! 🙌🤣
As much as I hate mosquitos I have to admit their adaptations are kinda amazing
The ''little kinky'' bastards.... haha
"hellOoh!"
15:52 till the end is amazing! Your videos are so helpfull and funny and they really help with becomming more at ease with scientific English! As a biogolgie student who has English as second language, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
Need to plane elephant mosquitoes everywhere there are blood sucking ones...... elephant mosquitoes will eat the blood sucking bastards
graphic and very educational
I don’t care  how cool mozzies are or that zefrank commentated it. I still hate mozzies, they don’t do anything except bite us 🤣
Literally the most annoying insects in the word. But lovely vedio
9:15 "now its getting dicked by a skeeter"
Since time of the dinosaur
Buxzzz sound
When you pit something on the surface of the water they cant breath
Disgusting creatures
Can we eradicate the ones that feed on us with minimal negative consequences?
"It sort of looks like a depressed ghost."
Like listening to any brittish teacher i came across. Pay attention or you may miss out on the gems.
When I kill mosquitoes, it’s with the rage of an angry god!
This was  so cool! I kind of knew there was more than one mosquito species, but this really made that real and showed such wonderful variation in things too small for me to even really see. I enjoyed the "mosquitos all the way down" line as well as all the interesting facts you provided. Thanks so much for all the time and effort you put into this and all your other videos!
Nice cute informative video, but I still hate all mosquitoes.
Interesting thank u
I discovered mosquitoes are attracted to their own sound when I accidentally hummed and matched their tone(I researched and yeah they thought it was a female sound lol) . I used it to lure them while facing an electric racket in front of my face, they would eventually approach my mouth where the sound was coming and would eventually fly to their death. I was 12.
I’m weird apparently, mosquitoes 🦟 don’t like me 🤣🤘🏽 idk why, but I’ve been mosquito bite free most of my life.
Gosh f'ing dang it. Mosquitoes have a purpose
I cannot express just how badly I now want a Caterpie/Weedle pokemon based on the mosquito. "My cocoon stage knows Double Team instead of Harden. Eat your heart out."
I love the commentary, keep it going!
I don’t care what they pollinate I advocate mosquito genocide
Moscow-wheat-o
Does anyone know the name of that classical peice playing in the background? I love it.
So what Happened when you kill a  Mosquito that is still drinking your blood? Does it Tongue just stay in side of you?
But... chickens already announce their eggs to the world...  They positively sing about it
i had a feeling this would be funny... im new :3
Wish they stayed underwater
I hate it
Sorry Frank, still wish these bastards, or at least that 5% that hurt humans, would go extinct. Oh they do the pollination for a few flowers? They kill thousands a week. No thank you sir.
Thanks... Nothing better than staring into mosquito's butt while eating breakfast.
know thy enemy
Well great now I'm all itchy
helLO!
0:38 "This might be a good time to go to the kitchen and get something to eat."  Me eating in the kitchen while watching this:  I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you.
WHAT THE ACTUAL F..A...C
Their saliva is y u itch. It's an allergic reaction
Burn them all 😐
0:28 im striaght up dying rn
From now on I will buy and use repellent the moment these suckers start flying around.
I always asked myself what's the importance of mosquitoes in the food chain. To me it was a devil's creation to annoy people and suck their blood
"You can try this at your local pool" lmao
And here come the *BEBES* 0:48
True fact: Fuck mosquitoes.
I'm itchy
I hated mosquitos anyway but now i hate them more. I never want to get my teddybear skin get humped by a fliing doggo
Superb
"HeLOOO!" "heh."
that butt joke are getting old really fast...
I think bugs of every kind are awesome. If I had the patience, I’d be an entomologist.  Except for mosquitos.   I hate mosquitos.
The Sabethes Cyaneus is an amazingly pretty mosquito 🦟 So colourful & fluffy!
I hope when you have a baby you only call it a bebe.
Egg bombing, that's one badass way to be born
Отличное видео, пересматриваю много раз!
1:17 time to trow the water on the ground!  Sometime I purposely leave pools of water so a mosquito wasted her time an energy to have all her babies gone.
I nearly died laughing when you said, "And now it's getting dicked by a skeeter"!  Hahahahahahaha!
5:44 "twisty twisty"   😀
I hate mosquitos and the fact that I can not even hear those pests anymore, when they are stalking me, just makes it so much worse.
Bebeszz
Belostomatidae is a family of freshwater hemipteran insects known as giant water bugs or colloquially as toe-biters, Indian toe-biters, electric-light bugs, alligator ticks, or alligator fleas. They are the largest insects in the order Hemiptera. (The one you won't look up because you don't want it in your search history) ^_^
Very nice
The mosquitoes in my area of Pennsylvania go for the feet. Absolutely wreck you from calf down.
Thanks for your misinformation.... No thanks!
Anyone else get itchy watching this?
Would love to see a video about bed bugs with this much data and information. Make it happen.
wait wait wait if the eggs have a bit of human blood so does that mean we been killing our kids ?
Helloo!
That "DEMON BABY" got me to immediately subscribe😂
The 'poopa' looks like Betelgeuse when he turned into a snake
so, if you break it down...... i am a parent
I am so glad he is back every time he puts out a video.... He's the best on YouTube
So I'm walking my dog listening to the video, as one does, and RIGHT at the instant he says "what the FU-" I hit a patch of black ice and nearly fall on my ass
Poor Johnston
When a mosquito bites me, I try to tap it just hard enough to disable it, but not kill it. Then I pull its wings off, and let it sit there and think about why it should not have bit me, for the rest of its life.
VIDEO IDEA: that laser thingy that scientists made to kill flying bugs (for laser aiming bragging rights) and similar devices.  They've got weirdness of their own!!
I got weirdly itchy watching this lol especially during the mosquito blood vessel fishing adventure 😂
This made me itchy and hate mosquitoes even more.
This is hysterical 🤣🤣🤣 thank you so much for this. ❤️🖤❤️ now I’ve got this guy and the dude from Casual Geographic.
DEMON *dramatic headturn* BEHBEH *dramatic headturn*  I nearly peed myself 😂
Wow that was disturbing… I hate mosquitoes even more.
"The misquetoes who've gotten a taste for humans, on the other hand, are very good at finding us." Not that we're that hard to find…
"Now that bebeh ded bebeh" 😂
They don't tend to sense my hand coming down to crush them....buzzing-in-my-ear-while-I'm-trying-to-sleep little bastards.
Learning about these things has never been more entertaining!! Love these!
me: KILL ALL MOSQUITOES zefrank: mosquitoes are pollinators me: *god fucking dammit*
I like your channel. Your humor needs to be more subtle.
That moment you realized you contributed to making babies without realizing with your DNA. We got mosquito babies
😆😆Holy hell, I think I just peed myself. How have I just found this channel? 😂😂
Mosquitoes are old species. They would be way more successful if their saliva contained a strong substance causing humans to be intoxicated. Evolution, ffs...
Poor bebes
I hate to say it, but this video kinda _sucks_
I love how he says bebes
"Hell LO" made me laugh-fart
Triopse!
Why I watch this: know thy enemy
9:54 That's a leech not an earthworm.
Wow,, he put a lot of work into that video. He even made the music. Most impressive.
Fuck Mosquitoes!
This was so much more interesting than my MDARD books lol 😆
After 24 seconds of starting the video I laughed. Im drunk....
No. No nnnnn no ooooooooooo
Now we can categorically hate these bastards
I was wondering what leaves little white spots on on my jacket and mirror. Now I know it's jus mosquitoes laying eggs ... mystery solved. Thank you ☺️
Perhaps you could make a long extended disco version of your mosquito song?
We need to support elephant mosquitos
When she slides her proboscis needle into you slowly 😳😩🥵  Fellas we've been tricked, they were off the radar! Mommas been penetrating us for years 👹
Was trying to brush by teeth while watching this… just spit all over my mirror. Thanks zefrank
My skin itches and makes me nauseous just watching this
The "But" Joke never gets old XD
*Demun Bebeh*
Mosquitos are good for pollinating, but they’re also good at making animals not want to stick around areas. I’m sure the plants appreciate the lack of erosion and overgrazing!
everytime zefrank1 says culex, i swear i think about the bonus boss from smrpg lol
Can I get a full version of the song at the end??
I skip the info about the sponsor. Still don't know who it is or what they do.
‼️Trypophobia timestamp 0:29-1:04 ‼️
*Watches Video* "Very Interesting...still hate the annoying little f*ckers"
The itch is real right now watching them
*Demon baby* 👹
Mosquitoes are pollinators?  I guess it's time for all plants to die in fire.
Ty bro
You're slaying me, keep em coming. 🇨🇦🍁🐘🤗
8:16 : boots wit the fur! (wit the fuurr!!!)
3:10 I believe that one’s a giant water bug. A true bug, rather than “bugs” just referring informally to all arthropods.
Hans get ze flamethrower
Freaking mini vampire with wings
One of his best intros....🤣🤣🤣
Oh my.
Can’t wait the day when gmo mosquitoes be released into the wild and exterminate all the species and genus of those parasites, end them with extreme prejudice
I'm not squeamish. I've seen animals eviscerate other animals, I've seen disgusting wounds, I've seen maggots and roaches and fuckin tapeworms.  But those eggs at the beginning? I physically gagged.
3:50 😂 never gets old! Forever Funny!
You always make me laugh frank. The before you get arrested got me 🤣😂
Who is the narrator?
I keep dodging child support and killing the baby mom in one fell smack
Watching this made me feel itchy all over 😟
Really really Funny shit
I didn't care about mosquitoes until I got dengue fever...since then I still don't care about mosquitoes.
*D e m o n     B a b y*
Hello!!! 🦟
THE BEST EXISTENCE IS NONE EXISTENCE.  KNOW LIFE, KNOW PAIN.  NO LIFE, NO PAIN.  ANTINATALISM.
https://youtu.be/WwkglH0rnRE mosquito larva
This IS brilliance!
Do they share DNA with politicians?
Love these vids!
I am so thankfull to the YT algorithm for suggesting me your video, your humour is exactly what I needed. Thank you for existing !!
you lost a viewer over your pronunciation of babies
"HELLO!"
Hellooooooo!
DEMON BABY
I did not have a fear of holes but watching those mosquitoes emerge helped me cultivate one
Educational and hilarious.
I hope you’re an 8th grade science teacher.  Kids would never leave your classes
Beh behs  MOSQU EEEE TOES
I just started reading "In A Sunburned Country," by Bill Bryson after watching a ton of Zefrank videos, and I swear, the author's cadence and turns of phrase sound just like Zefrank. I can't stop hearing his voice in my head as I read 😂😂😂  For example:  “Each time you fly from North America to Australia, and without anyone asking how you feel about it, a day is taken away from you when you cross the international date line. I left Los Angeles on January 3 and arrived in Sydney fourteen hours later on January 5. For me there was no January 4. None at all. Where it went exactly I couldn’t tell you. All I know is that for one twenty-four-hour period in the history of earth, it appears I had no being.   I find that a little uncanny, to say the least.  I mean to say, if you were browsing through your ticket folder and you saw a notice that said, “Passengers are advised that on some crossings twenty-four-hour loss of existence may occur” (which is, of course, how they would phrase it, as if it happened from time to time), you would probably get up and make inquiries, grab a sleeve, and say, “Excuse me.” There is, it must be said, a certain metaphysical comfort in knowing that you can cease to have material form and it doesn’t hurt at all, and, to be fair, they do give you the day back on the return journey when you cross the date line in the opposite direction and thereby manage somehow to arrive in Los Angeles before you left Sydney, which in its way, of course, is an even neater trick."
Great...they suck your blood AND shit on you.
"there are baby mosquitoes out there that may be made with bits of you"  Nature is beautiful, man
With all that fiddling around i suddenly get why it itches a heckton when i get bitten
I´m a grumpy guy, but you always manage to make me laugh :)) Thank you
Dude, if my science teacher in high school had taught me in the same manner as this dude... I'd probably be some famous scientist by now!
You are amazing.  And for giving me a 20% discount on a year of stretchies for my thinky lobes, you are also Brilliant.  You are amazingly brilliant.
Your approach to teaching about wildlife is absofknlutly the best mix of comedy in science I've ever seen. Thanx
Damn. It's been a minute since I've watched these vids after this series started the blow up again. I'm loving the music at the ends. The whole video is perfection as always.
The “Demon Baby” bit got me ROLLING! 🤣🤣🤣 I love this F#%?ing channel
Haha moria rose will be proud of zefrank
3:09 this is a water scorpion, not a baby and not a scorpion either
As much as we hate the ones that feed on humans, mosquitoes are important pollinators and food source for many animals.
I love this 😩👌
"Oh look, its head can turn all the way around!   DEMON BEBBE!" omfg dude I'm dying 🤣🤣🤣
Guess I'm kinda weird for not disliking mosquitoes. Hell, they can make bæbæs with my blood if they want, just don't pass RIGHT NEXT TO MY EARS WHILE I'M TRYING TO SLEEP when doing so.  Nevermind, I hate them (but those disco mosquitoes at 8:16 are still kinda cool).
This is by far the most fascinating, informative and interesting 17 minutes of mosquito-related content I have ever seen.
1 million dead every year divided by the world population of roughly 7 billion equals 0.00014285714. That’s an extremely small number, mosquitoes have almost no affect on human population.
"DEEMON BEBEHS"
I want just like 3 hours of him saying Bebe lmao
Nah i don't think you'll get arrested, you'll just wake up one day finding out you've been playing with your ass on someone's tiktok page.
The true question;  How many mosquitoes out there are part of my bloodline?
I’m sorry, I’m already laughing at the tag line for Brilliant. There are ALOT of people in this world that need to “learn to think.” (To clarify: it’s a good tag line.)
"Beh'beh"
"I mean who hasn't lost a child or two at the water park?"
Trypophobia - Ihazzit.
Oh God I have mosquito babies out there... Not more problem children.        I'm going to tell hizashi he has bugs for babies.
If one baby from tons of generations of mosquitoes feed off one person and their babies are made of parts of you, and then they make babies and they feed from you and so on, along the way, one will be 100% you, right?
1:37….. challenge accepted, lol
honestly, zefrank could narrate how it feels to be stuck in traffic and I'd watch it again and again until I knew the words by heart
no one:  elephant mosquito: hello!✨✨
pls do a true facts about foxes <3
HellooOOoo! 🤣
Can we get a full version to the mosquito song! Love it!
0:24 "Dale, I really think you shou-WHAT THE FU-let's back up a bit." Best. Intro. Ever. 2:11 "Demon baby." 2:54 "I mean you certainly don't get close to-THERE. Told you." 6:19 Just like humans. sure the males may LOOK scary. But it's the LADIES you need to be scared of! 9:14 "And now it's getting dicked by a skeeter." 12:01 GOOD LORD! What do I gotta pay to unsee THIS SHIT!? 14:37 Yeet the baby!
I don’t know why but Zefrank’s “don’t ask a creature what it’s good for. Try asking a chicken what a human’s good for, you won’t like what he says.” That was someone just really inspirational and moving despite being a joke
dragonfly larvaes… psychos
you know, for some reason, the idea that there are some skeeters out there that I indirectly helped make out in Algeria is actually very interesting... I hope those little bitches are doing well.
HELLOOO BEBBIES!
Plants, by producing oxygen, are actually farming us. Merry Christmas! The weed is good 😎 and the Appletons. 🤟
"Hello!" made me laugh a couple of times hahaha
2:59 that's some xenomorph shit
This was not only educational, but it was thoroughly entertaining and hilarious.
The bebies
10:28 So, if there’s a really annoying mosquito, you can just breathe on it, tricking it into biting you so you can slap it? That’s a life hack I wasn’t expecting.
Zefrank's videos have been making me laugh until it hurts while educating me for the last 10 years and they're a real treat. I'm so happy this series is running again!  Also I'll never forget the Teddy operation video. That was... Idk that stuck with me. Same with "Your Eyes Are Stupid"
I really lost it at the way he said "roof" ⤴ when talking about siphons and how they look like the poles coming out of bumper cars  edit: POO pating LOL
When I feel slightly sad I watch these. Life is amazing ,crazy and hilarious.
😂😂💚💚💚
I regret watching this while eating
'You end up with a sulky chicken.'  Fuggin genius 👏👏❤🇬🇧
I'm an MD who now feels like a mosquito, except for the part of laying eggs.
That bebby...dead bebby...😂
Lol Johnston and his tiny organ
Thanks, I hate it.
I don’t know lol what that even is, I’m not googling it 🤣
fuck those disco mosquitos are the prettiest freakin' bugs i've ever seen
It's mosquitoes all the way down? Zefrank reads John Green confirmed!
It's horrifying sometimes. Canoeing in the BWCAW in early spring, maybe a month after the lakes have thawed and spring relieves the land from its yearly slumber you can see them.  Thousands, millions of unborn demon babies floating in the water.
13:35 Guys out there are now fathers 👩‍🍼
This might be too niche but I definitely understand more about “The Scar” by China Mièville after watching this video
Demon baby
MuaStayassh
and the _Least_ Aesthetically pleasing  looking *mfs* in the WHOLE  ENTIRE  animal Kingdom, uuughhh..
my Professional Presentation on Why mosquitos should Not Contribute to existence Mosquitos are The most fucking Pointless insect in Society,  including the Animal Kingdom, it is a Obscure Creature with multiple Legs.  majority of Animals Only contain 2 or 4 legs, these Creatures has 6 of Them.    why need So Many limbs... Especially when it Has the ability to Fly? birds Only have 2 legs.  And a Bird is a Non-insect Animal but Shares a Similar trait with Mosquitos, they both Can take Flight, but both of Them do Not share the Same Amount of legs,  Also,  this Little Critter does not Own a Mouth,  unlike the Mass of Animals, likewise  ant-eaters is Not an insect. Despite the Name,  not to be Confused with Actual ants, ant-eaters have a Sucking tube, like a Vacuum but Mosquitos Consume blood, ... blood is not a Consumable Resource  although it's Edible for Mosquitos and Vampire bats. if Ant-eaters are able to Only Consume a Certain insect why Not mosquitos? Is that Just not theyre Desire...?  the Ecosystem Would not Change without mosquitos,  they desire Consuming blood from JUST humans  and NO OTHER ANIMAL ... humans Will NEVER find interest in Eating mosquitos  and yes, it's a Possibility that Other animals find Pleasure in eating Bugs,  and That includes mosquitos.  But they are the MOST disgusting Thing to eat, ever. even if they are Cooked with Sauce and Seasoning,  in certain Cultures  around the globe, People eat bugs, but There has never been Proof or reports presenting Somebody eating a Mosquito and Taking Joy in that.. it's still Gross and Could possibly Die or get Sick  from Eating it,....plus No other Animal  Needs to Live off mosquitos, alone.  The sole Purpose of mosquitos,   is to Steal kiII and Destroy ,   They are tiny Mass murderers, Annoying ASF,  And the Sound they Produce HAS 0 PURPOSE and isn't Beneficial to anyone Ears, have Also Created the Virus called, Zeka.   Mosquitos just need to  go extinct Already ❤️ and stop being whores with other mosquitos  bye
This video made me itchy
I don't know if it's bad that I was giggling non-stop from about 10 secs in or not... either way, thank you for making mosquitoes a lot more interesting for this wildlife lover
Please sir collab with casual geographic
Ahh..my state bird.
15:08 Gold
“Hello!”
3:49 Poor guy 😅
The footage of the mosquito rising out of the water is scarier than any horror movie I've seen, and I once shouted out loud "WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE THAT??" when watching Carpenter's The Thing.
1:14 so they literally syphon gas
and here i am, drunk as fuck watching air enter the pupa
deadliest animal on Earth
Zefrank—national treasure
True fact about mosquitoes:  They SUCK!
Just a side note - Aedes Aegypti are invasive to the US, and we should totally exterminate them if we can. They're one of those species that carries disease, and eliminating them would allow the native mosquitos (which, by and large, don't carry disease) to reclaim their original niche.
Where's Jerry?
HELLO!! Lol
hahahaha nice video
DeMoN bABeH😈
Yeah, as someone who has been dealing with a mozzie hitchhiker (Ross Ricer Fever. I had it for 8 months straight the first time and now it comes and goes) for the last 18 months, mozzies suck. Fuck mozzies.   Except the elephant mozzies, they seem cool.
XD I remember stumbling on your channel in 2013 and seeing every single video and thinking ,wow I wish there was so much more,and randomly years later I am blessed with all this content xD
HellOOOO!  o/
The first part killed me. The end : THE FUC-
and this is why I'd rather have...... "Regular Ass dinosaur park"
Watching this while getting bit by mosquitoes 🦟
"Helloooo👐🏽" 😂😂😂
They one creature almost everybody wants to go extinct. Flowers be damned.
amazing information thanks.  I always wonder how they can survive winters and return in such great numbers.
"Someone might get the wrong idea" 😩😂💀💀
I sincerely hope that these videos are used by college and university professors to introduce their students to certain biological concepts.
I thought this would enlighten me and make me more tolerant of mosquitoes... I was wrong
I'm about as anti-Creationist as you can get, but how nature could produce such incredible complexity and specialization by random mutation alone is just extremely hard to imagine, even over hundreds of millions of years. And the whole metamorphosis thing itself? How did that evolve? Bugs certainly seem very fond of it. The miracles we see every day in nature make God's miracles in the bible seem pretty tawdry, unimaginative, and third rate
Did not know that Mosquitoes pollinate. So they are actually useful. But they’re still creepy as hell. Lil bug vamps
ah yes, the wonderful world of the muskoweeto
so is there like a way we can genetically create more of these elephant mosquitoes as a way to combat things like malaria and any other mosquito born pathogen?
Lit it on fireeee. I really hateee misquotes
Can you imagine bioengineered mosquito saliva
THE FUCKING ELEPHANT MOSQUITO EMERGING KILLED ME
DEMON BABY
“Dicked by a skeeter” really got me in this one
It goes through so much to become a mosquito and I still hate it! So it shites on me while sucking my blood! I truly hate these monsters!
You should make one on bedbugs. Imagine al the likes.
Excellent, came for the humor, stayed for the biology.
Okay the intro already had me crying xD
Hey man, love you're videos, so do my wife and kids. Been watching you for years but this is my first comment. Can I ask you a favour? Can you make a video to encourage all the good people in the lower mainland of British Columbia who have been affected by the recent floods? One last request. Keep making cool videos so I can keep watching them. Selfish request I know, but there you go. I guess I'm just a selfish human being. There. I said it. I hope you're happy.  Sincerely, Russell Crick
This is one of the funniest and most educational of  zeFrank's videos that I've ever seen
This was absolutely hilarious! The greatest nature video ever!
Mosquito killed a loved one. Just eradicate them.
Hang on Stop right there!!! Did that mosquito just blood suck a flamingoes eyeball? ........it fkn did !!!!!!    And then! You tell me my blood made baby mosquitoes. Im having a massive exsistential crisis right now. I need a lie down. With a can of spray. No i cant - i might kill my clones..FK!!!!
Mosquitos are the biggest reason why i hate every other season besides winter.
that hole footage took so long that I am now unable to feel my neck
Haha crab hole creep is my favorite statement of the day.
You are very creative
Most videos are 8 to 11 minutes long. Mosquitos - 17 minutes, *zefrank crackes open a beer* "ok kids sit down i've got some shit to tell you"
HELLO!
You, Ze Frank, are the most intelligent person I've witnessed. Try to find the front door man operator in this whole creation. He's that little thin red man looking like Jesus on the cross, just above the white lip mouth, dead center. He gets covered up by the right leg-hand holding the white lip mouth down. He's the weirdo in the whole thing.
I love your content... but I'm getting so ITCHY!!!
Remember guys, butt first!
I've been in the kitchen for over a month. Is it safe to leave yet?
This is a good one!
I can't click fast enough when I see a new true facts post.
Leave the elephant mosquito alive if we ever find a way to terminate mosquitoes
Aedes aegypti... oh Aedes aegypti...
I'd like to see one about planarians, including the weird, polypharyngeal species of _Phagocata_
Surgeon operating on a patient buried in a ball pit. 😁 the descriptions around here are just spot on.
Why don’t they try and make more elephant mosquitos to controls the normal mosquitoes? If they eat them and don’t drink blood.  Idk just a thought lol 😂
Learn so much more from these vids than the long boring nature ones or the ones that shoehorn in politics. Good for teens or young college kids imo.
"Little egg bomb"
Interesting & educational. I still hate them, but liked the Lady Gaga, disco pants & “Hello” lines😂
DEMON. BABY. XD HOLY FUCK I'VE NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD AT SOMETHING
Not appropriate to share with curious kids
Dead be-be’s lmao
I love zfrank’s “ you can try this at home!”examples.😜
Watching this as I scratch a mosquito bite. I hope the little guy is using my blood for good things 🦟 #vampirepollinators
HELLOOOOOO
I love how this whole series started as basically a joke with entirely made-up non-facts, and has grown, with audience encouragement, into exhaustively well-researched videos that actual real scientists are proud to contribute to, and actual teachers are proud to use as teaching tools.  Butt jokes and ridiculous puns and all sorts of silliness, wrapped around actual TRUE FACTS.  Love it.  I'm sure Mr. ZeFrank had no idea this would happen, but we're all so grateful that you followed this path.  Thank you for all your hard work and dedication.
Nothing I hate more in this world than a mosquito, just die out already..
crabhole creep...it's mosquitos all the way down...DWE...sulky chicken...
The “DEMON. BEBE.” nearly killed me 😂
Are there false facts?
Finally, a plus to losing my legs. 😂
If you ever think humans are the most dangerous animal on Earth I want you to know that mosquitoes have killed more humans than humans have.
WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME MOSQUITOS POLINATE FLOWERS????  I grew up for most of my life thinking they were nothing but food for bats, frogs, and birds.
Mos-Qow-itoes, 😂😂
Do crane flies :o
Ants, Bats, Birds and the rest of the whatever-the-fucks that eat Mosquitos need to step it the hell up!
I'm sure we can all agree that the best thing a mosquito is good for is killing/eating OTHER mosquitos. In fact, I almost wish I could keep an elephant mosquito. That might be only because I live in Florida, but still. Mosquitos are frickin' _everywhere_ during the summer. God forbid someone leaves a tire, bucket, car part, or anything else that can hold water in it outside.   I still remember a few years back when someone left a RUG outside during the summer. It got rained on. They left it pretty much RIGHT beside the front-fuggin'-door. Guess what attracted a fuck ton of mosquitos, as well as roaches and gnats, AND guess what we deemed FUBAR and decided to throw away. Also, guess what was not cheap at all.  God, I hate Florida.  *Get me the Hell outta here.*
Yes, she takes blood meals FROM ME! Lol. I always get eaten alive….I end up itching like a dockside dolly after a particularly busy night of business! 😖
"now that bebeh, ded bebeh."
Camel Spider is weird enough for True Facts!
If there are mosquitos out there whit my DNA, then im not a virgin
woah, so cool, watching a story of my life
mossko itos
14:16 "Who hasn't lost a child or two at the water park." LOL!
To the most respectable Mr.Frank1, your videos are great sources of both endless information and entertainment for me and my family. As such, it would truly be most wonderful if you could make a future video about the Innkeeper Worm (also known as a Penis Fish). Regardless, I respectfully await your next video.
So.. I have children that have my dna.. that means I have mosquito children?
🏆NOBEL Prize for the Scientist that can make Mosquitoes EXTINCT  !!! ☠
Mosquito baybayz
Awesome i havent seen anything as interesting and entertaining like this great work
A masterpiece!
Like those poles on bumper cars that connect to the *roOOF*
So damn funny
If mosquitoes were ever to take human form somehow . I would take flight on sight👊👊 I hate mosquitoes with a passion
zefrank: "Named after Johnston, who must've had a tiny organ" Me: processes the joke, starts giggling zefrank: "Grow up" 5:26
Long live the elephant mosquito, breed more and eat eat all the other mosquito larva!!
Mosquitos all the way down needs to be a shirt
DEMON BABY
Man!!! I loved the way your comments on the video! Here's my sub!!!!
Listening to this while being hunted by mosquitos in my room.
I'm certain the folks at Brilliant absolutely adore that transition to their sponsored segment👍
Mosquitos on a cob
I hate them! Mosquitoes Behbehs can cleaning your dirty water. I hate them lesser!
🤣🤣the voice is comical and some of the jokes as well as this being educational too
I don't know what this is but what happened to Teddy?
so no ones talking about this 8:37 its like 10 men looking at a pregnant lady at the hospital waiting to give birth and when they see its  a girl they just jump in and start humping sorry to burn your eyes and brain but thats just how i do.
Numbing the nerves my ass, those bastard bites always itch!
Mosquito bebé
I don’t want to learn to think, thinking is dangerous
Damnit Frank. I thought mosquitos were useless blood thieves. You're telling me they're fuckin pollinators?!?! ☹
0:24 - "AHHH! After 10,000 years I'm free. It's time to conquer Earth!"
Sorry not sorry - I hate them lol. I’m allergic and also live on a flood plain with a creek. Lots of standing water. They’re EVERYWHERE! 😂😭
I love your videos! I could literally watch these every day all day 😂🤩
Oh thank Ze!! I've missed you!!!
Please Please PLEASE! Do a "True Facts" about Karens !
damn, "Mosquito Song" is one cool groove. Worth sticking around til the very end!
This is the second video I've watched in the last few days that's mentioned mosquitoes are better at killing humans than humans are.
Zefrank1, please make a video disapproving of YouTube hiding the number dislikes on a video. Even though YouTube is a private site and you can choose to show the number of dislikes, it’s one of the biggest platforms for media and YouTube needs to know that it’s content creators are in favor of letting their audience speak for themselves. Thank you for reading.
@9:04   Dicked by a skeeter has me in tears! I had this video saved for months and though it would be boring but fuck was I wrong! Funniest shit I’ve honestly seen in a while you got a sub!! Best way to learn is to laugh!!!!! A+++++ to this guy!
You should do a video about seals
hmm, would you ever do a video on ferrets?
Dale???? What happened to J/Gerry????
now that baby dead baby
Now that bebes a ded bebe 😆
Please do killer whales, they are gangsters!
I am so glad you are back. I'm a teacher and your videos make my entire day. I absolutely love your videos.
I remember in first or second grade we grew mosquitoes like we grew butterflies. I don’t know why. Maybe they were trying to get us to like mosquitoes? And now that I live in Manhattan, where there’s a shit ton of standing water, I can definitely say it didn’t work cause mosquitoes don’t pay rent and therefore die
You are the best!
Yow this style of narrating is quite Kool an hilarious totally different from the norm😂👍🏾.... #bebbies🤣🤣🤣
I love that I learn things while having fun.
Best pronunciation on Youtube, bar none.
Love you🤣😂😅😋😘🤩🤗
How isnt there a dragon fly one yet
3:10 - the assassin bug
DJI makes observing their flying characteristics: *Write that down! Write that down!*
Disabled comments? Coward.
way to kill off your own channel rofl
and thats why we dump out standing water besties
The cat in the new video said „dear human“ like a dog. What cat doesn’t respect the authority?
"They need to breathe and they breathe Air"  d a y m
Horrid creatures from beginning to end jfc  Except based elephant bois ofc
Do bedbugs next, please. They have hypodermic stab wieners!
Ahhhhh smash
*"Moscow•weetos"*
“It looks like snufflopagus but reimagined as a dildo wearing glasses” 20 seconds in and I’m loving this already.
An idea for a vid is the spiny lumpsucker such a weird but cute little fish
so mosquito is a pervert bastards 🤣🤣🤣
Again a great video! Keep up the excellent work! I'm looking  forward to another awesome upload! Take care and stay in touch! 💕💕
Amazing videography in this! this is some of the best content on youtube.
God:   Hey Satan come in come in, what brings you up here?  Satan:  Look I know we haven't been getting along, but what is your problem man? What's the punchline? Why?  God:   What are you talking about?  Satan:. Mosquitos!  God:   Mosquitos?? Satan, you know I don't get involved with your abominations, if you have an issue with your wicked toys I suggest y'all should be thinking about what you're doing like I've been telling you since the void!  Satan:  My abomination? I'm not the one with the controller man, I didn't create that crap!  God: I don't $hit in my sandbox, so it wasn't me!  Satan&God:  ... .............. ......OMG!!!
Laugh all you want. Only a matter of time before Skate Fighting becomes a new sport.
HelLOOOOOOO😂😂😂😂😂😂
So... Dino sororities are just pedophiles
What a great video :D
Can you do True Facts about Vanessa butterflies?
Fuck mosquitoes
GASP We’re related to mosquitoessssss
6:10 Fuck.  Mosquitoes are actually essential parts of certain ecosystems, then.  I think that's the most horrifying thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
Well.. I learned something new today.
TRYPOPHOBIA WARNING !!!!!
"Learn to think" - what every democrap needs to figure out how to do.
This was a great video
Me before this vid: Fuck all Mosquitos! BURN THEM ALL!!!  Me now: But leave the Elephant Mosquito alone, they are borderline divine.
this is the finest form of education
If all the Malaria carrying mosquitoes could die, that'd be great. I'm not allowed to drink thanks to the damage those bastards did to my liver.
True facts conehead termites.
If you can...pretty please...with all the cherries on top... I think doing a video on Crows would be awesome and funny as hell by you 😂
This is so funny. On so many levels.  (Ironically, I just watched a video the other day, on my other channel, that was almost entirely about Ze Frank... and I commented something like that I didn't even know who Ze Frank is but that I was glad they inspired the dude that much.  Then I switch accounts, for the first time in a while, and decide to look through my subscriptions, and WHAT DO YOU KNOW?!!  I see this channel!!  I guess I was familiar with Ze Frank!!😂  Damn Traumatic Brain Injury!!😂)  This is so well done, it's fabulously hilariously informative  -love it❣
Beb- bays and schpee-shes
Elephant mozzie is the most useful and therefore the only one that needs to be around. . . . . Like a spider.
I watched the angler video last week and last night I relayed what I learned to a few of my infantry in a dream.... I'm not in the army in waking life.
It's crazy that people have this much information about mosquitos.
Seeing Mosquito eggs and how they shoot them eggs is like seeing a bigfoot on football field: you never knew what they looked like in person
maybe i havent seen much yet but i think this is the only yt video ive watched with proper citations of sources man that was refreshing
The song at the end got me like 🎼😂😂🎶🤣🤣🤣🎵☠️
"now its gettin dicked by a skeeter"
Biology information gained in  my life; Zefrank>School.
Are we all just going to ignore that the one mosquito BIT THE FLAMINGO'S EYEBALL
b e b e
The dragonfly larvae is basically a venamorphe
I love this narration <3
So, just make them go extinct. Good
I love your sense of humour, and I love that you are delivering science in a fun way - I just wish the jokes were cleaner so they would be appropriate for a younger audience.  My 10 year old loves the first few videos we've watched together, but the obvious language in this mosquito video is just too mature for him.  My hope is that you'll dial back the vulgarity, but keep the humour so the kids can watch.  Thanks for your consideration.  You are very talented and entertaining.
Why couldn't Thanos just eliminate all mosquitos?? God, I hate this creature
"Don't want *that* mixed in with porn. Someone might get the wrong idea!"  Hmmmmm
Can I request you do a video about bed bugs?
They're cute as babies
Elephant mosquito best mosquito
No matter how tough it is to be a mosquito baby, in my opinion it is never tough enough
Your funny asf
4:41, 6:40, 16:56 Hel-LO!
Very funny story which has been already shown on other channels as well many times.
so informational, so hilarious SO UNCOMFY!
I had to pause this damn vid every 3 mins to finish ROTFLMAO and wipe off my tears and get back into my chair! God Damn! Zefrank1 ... Make a movie!!!
This just absolutely engages me to murder some more mosquitoes!
the best narrator Lmao
As someone who was eating AND have trypophobia I did not enjoy that egg part.
Lady Gaga joke had me bursting out 😂
He-LLOOO
Mosquitoes coming out of the water look like the secret boss cutscene after you summon it
HELLOW
Helloo!
I hate mosquitoes but how I love listening to this man. 😁
#teamseas
This documentary looks so normal from the thumbnail. But it’s hilariously good. Imagine a teacher playing one of your videos.  The teacher: hello class. Today we will be watching a completely normal nature documentary.   The documentary saying inappropriate things lol.  Teacher: ok that’s enough for now.
All part of God's wonderful plan. Eat or be eaten in a particularly nasty and painful way.
Trypophobia is the fear in question.
Dale just really likes dogs
African Honey Badger
TEWBES... kills me everytime, I don't know why :D
I really like it (what's there not to like) but prey tell, what's with all that shady beeping of profanity. Your videos aren't obviously for 12yrs olds, so is the Youtube so pretentious nowadays or is it something else I don't get?
Dale? What happened to Jerry? 🙂
You still remember 8 years ago? Teadybear? I think its GORE
Bebehs
I'm so glad these are still being made. It's been so long I'm not even sure when I first watched a zefank true facts video.
What's the point of injecting pain numbing chemicals to not get detected and slapped when they just inject itching chemicals and get detected and normally slapped before flying away? Seems counter productive.
Ewww it’s about mosquitoes why
Content mmmmm
..And they look a little bit like those poles on bumper cars that are attached to the RRRRRRRRRRRRRRROOF!
What's the name of the classical song in the background
When I was house shopping years ago, I saw a handful of Guppies swimming in the pool. My real estate agent told me the health dept. put the fish there for mosquito control.
YO THE DRAGON FLYS LARVAS TUNG LOOKS LIKE A XENOMORPH TUNG
"And that's the thing about kinder garden, there is always a bitter" Bruh this made me bust out laughing like an idiot at work and everyone around me started staring XDXDXDXD sorry, not sorry. The whole video is 100% fucking gold!
The only living thing that i would want to genocide.  Mosquitoes should not exist.
0:25 oh god that is freakish
The other day I was in traffic and I noticed someone's bumper sticker said, "I'd rather be growing talking trees." And I just thought, if any other living thing on this planet could communicate with us humans, I doubt they would have anything very nice to say. Dogs might be the only creatures that's half on our side.
I didn't think this episode could get any better, and then the song started.... Best end to a day!
DEMON BEBEH
Only 3 minutes in and already loving it man. Killer job
I used to think mosquitoes had no ecological purpose and were just parasitic nuisances. Later, I learned they were necessary food for bats and such. And today, I learned they're pollinators.  Sigh, I must begrudgingly admit they're good for something.
I may hate mosquitoes but watching those babies squiggle around is very entertaining.
Whenever he says "let's back up a bit", you know it's gon be good! 😌
Lol Hello
How's the collab with McBess going? x )
yo the larva of the flychampaurus looks like a goblin shark except transparent and doesn't have fins
I watched this video 3 times and still laugh xD just love this video. That's what YouTube is for. Thanks you
Hilarious
mosquitos pollinate okay okay...but do they have to make me itch?? evolve a nicer saliva nerve number you little assholes
I had dengue from an Aedes mosquito bite last year as I was walking home. It was awful because the doctors told me I was losing a lot of blood due to internal bleeding and so I was hospitalized for a week. I developed weird marks on my body and I felt incredibly weak that it became difficult for me to even walk. I lost my appetite and began losing weight and because of covid, I was alone for that whole week. Nobody could visit me. It was just absolutely terrifying but I'm glad I made it out alive.
I have a great critter to do, many jokes to b made.  Whiptail lizards. All female species 😉😁
I can't stand your narration with its constant bent towards profanity every chance you get.  And oh, today, you revealed you have tons of porn hidden on your computer, admitting you are a pervert.  That was the point  I turned you off and will never listen to you again.
Lesson of the day, "mosquitoes are kinky bastards." 😂
The amount of research and work you put into this is amazing
Scaly-foot snail next? Pls
*Mosquito behbehs*
2:11 My moms firsts words when I was born and thrown into a Catholic Foster Home and beaten every day and made to pray to Jesus every 5 minutes, and then beaten and then pray for lunch, and then slapped for not praying while eating.
Oh, wow.. yeah, fascinating.    Yup, I hate it.  The blissful ignorance I had minutes ago will never be regained.
If we had educational videos like this whenever I was in school I mean I did enjoy learning so I would have been just even more enthusiastic but we would have a lot more scientists today than we do I mean don't get me wrong bill and I was great but this would have been much better than textbooks that give us bland facts without actually letting us see them and making us laugh to help us remember
"You end up with a sulky chicken" broke me XD
Imagine sucking blood from a larger animal’s belly only to look down to your belly and find a smaller version of you sucking blood from your belly.
i forgot this masterpiece was in yt
Mfs get trapped in my leg hairs and I find them immediately
that's the most disgusting thing i've ever watched
"True Facts: The Scorpion" wen?
Normally, learning about an animal makes me like them more. Not this time.
when no fucking female mosquitos we should have fucking lived
Instructions unclear was I supposed to do this in public or at home
Plus they teach us stuff too 😊
I love all your videos they make me and my mom laugh our asses off 😂😆
How he prounces babies- is like baba es
Why do they release genetically engineered mosquitos if there are natural mosquito predators that could be released instead?
I 💕 your videos! I just found out about an insect I've seen, but didn't know what it was until about 3 minutes ago. I instantly thought of you. The Red Velvet Ant. Which is actually a parasitic wasp. How cool is that. It would make a pretty great video coming from your amazing perspective, I think. Just a thought.
So basically, I have been a third wheel parent for many Mosquitos…. Great.🥴
so mosquitos DO serve a purpose!!! they're worlds most irritating pollinator.   my mind is blown
Doesthis man have a back story? He just popped up on youtube sound these facts but who is he, what does he do these ?
Thank you once again!
let your butt breach and spread em.
"And now its getting dicked by a skeeter"
what about teddy
I love this style of narration, it’s beautiful
I wanna thank you no matter what my day is like you always seem to make me laugh and smile thank you for what you're doing I really enjoy your videos keep up the good work and May God bless you
This is some alien shit
DEMON BEBE😈😂
Dude I SALUTE YOU for warning me about the goddamn holes, as soon as I saw it I turned away and skipped when you told me to ouff.
The narration is on point here
The extensive research that goes into these amazingly funny and also accurate video's amazes me!
I don't like it :(
depressed ghost 😂
I love your channel
Quick question, why don’t you shout out the scientists involved in making these videos more? I love the videos and have watched them multiple times but am just now following the scientists because your outrows are so gosh darn entertaining. Anyway if you read this freaks hope you take this under consideration if you haven’t already and keep up the great work.
Thank you for the trypophobia trigger warning could’ve given it before the holes showed up ffs I’m gonna have a heart attack I think i’ll finish watching this video later
gotta be One of the best episodes ever... thank you So Very Much
I was reading an article just now and came across the words "grand babies" and in my head I read it as "grand behbies".  You've ruined me, zefrank.
Oh no I can’t look at shrimp the same way again
Bug buzz on this
I hate that I, with my phobia of needles, watched a video that showed a close up of how an insect with basically a needle mouth extracts blood from my body
"Getting dicked by a skeeter"... really?! There has to be rules! You shouldn't be allowed to drop some hilarious shite like that without a warning first. I think I dislocated a rib!
Make more. Sir, make more please. I'll be watching reruns. Moar please...
This is one of the only channels that I watch that I'm laughing and learning at the same time.  Thanks for the vids and keep em coming!
As a resident of Maine, aka the great northern feeding ground for mosquitos, I have gained a whole new understanding of mosquitoes...still hate them, but have a little bit more respect for them
15:40 that's where rice comes from bro. disgusting
This man....is one of my go to's for a good fucking laugh!.....and have some nature edumecation too v.v
..the scene of the behbehs coming out of the egg raft gave me full body chills. Thanks, I absolutely hated it.
Use the mosquito to destroy the mosquito....
true facts of the penis snake
If my biology teacher showed these i would actually learn stuff
That’s not a butthole, that’s pair of labia and a cervix
This man has more research and references on a humorous YouTube video than I did on my Masters Thesis research paper....
Mosqitoes riding worms... Dune vibes)
beginning of this was just IRL spore
I notice that you seem to be making these about animals a lot of people don't like. Spiders, bats. tics, and now mosquitoes. Learning about their life cycles and natural habits makes them a lot more endearing :)
What's the name of the can opener larva?
Ok so theoretically speaking, does wearing a mask make us harder for mosquitoes to find???
"The whining sound of the female's wings."   Well played.
14:13 lol XD
Who’s Dale, Frank what’s going on
i can't finish it
Another gem!
Bbbbebess
I'm dying laughing.  Thank you for the great laugh and all the interesting information regarding those awful little f'ers!
Hmmmm try to talk about the echidna 1 interesting mammal 2 ridiculous name 3 weird penis fact 4 and sonic the hedgehog jokes
Thank you for addressing the "what are mosquitos good for" question. All too often, we view the lens of the natural world through an anthropomorphic lens, with humans at the centre.
Plzzz dont disappear for another 3 months😫love your narrating
so NOW I have to stop wishing them all death because they pollinate! Thanks! Thank you very much for ruining the one perfect enemy I had! THANKS!! *grumple grumple*
Great vid. Will we ever get sequels to the Cat and Dog diaries? :)
Please do a true facts episode on rabbits and hares. Please.....💜
I once squished a mosquito and got someone else's blood on my hand
Between this insect and the rats that brought the plague....jeez...the deaths
When I was a kid, I use to catch mosquito larvae in jars to watch them turn into adult mosquitoes.
Thanks, just seeing this after getting my west nile virus diagnosis
OUTSTANDING. Educational AND funny. Keep em coming. SMILE
I'd really like to see more stuff about red-blooded, breathing animals, like the frogs in that clever cameo
LMFAO. Ze you are my absolute favorite YT creator. I get so excited when a new True Facts is posted. SO FUNNY!!!
So... elephant mosquitoes are our allies? Where can I buy them? Mosquitoes love me, they'll ignore everyone else to get to me and then I swell up worse than other people too 😒
amazing video, and hilarious commentary
Lmfao this is awesome!
"This looks like the inside of a teddy bear being humped by a chiuaua" is probably my new favorite sentance ever.
Wow, that was the most amazing photography with really good information, but the narration was so horrible I felt like crying. It was literally painful to listen to. Is there anyway to redo the narration? It could be BBC level awesome (sorry narrator.)
Am I high as fuck or did he just say that there could be mosquito's with my DNA if a female fed on my blood??? Wtfffffff
It's a shame they cant escape my towl slash smash, it's very effective!
https://youtu.be/rJPzitsk6WI
What a wonderful find!
Mosquitos are good as pollinators.  I know we wish they'd all go extinct, but they have a purpose other than spreading malaria, or zika.
did you just mention pubity
“now that bebe dead bebe” 😩😩😩😩
Mosquitoes themselves aren't even that bad. I'd rather deal with them than things like horseflies or botflies. It's just that a lot of pathogens have evolved to hitch a ride with mosquitoes, so they tend to have more "baggage" than other biting flies.
Don’t watch this while sitting in a waiting room for your wife to go through carpal tunnel surgery. I literally burst out laughing more than a couple times. This might be one of the funniest ones yet! Well done Zefrank. Well done.
Ticks, now mosquitoes, I'm guessing we're going to get leeches next. And the fun fact it was literally someone's job once upon a time to walk into marshes and be live bait to collect them.
Watching this while lying in bed with the room light on…because there’s a mosquito in here. Who the F are these people willing to let a mosquito suck on them for science?! Screw that nonsense. And the flowers that are pollinated by mosquitos can F right off. Mosquitos are of the Devil.
I used to hate mosquitoes, but now that I've learned that they pollinate, I now respect them MUCH more.
yo is teddy doing alright?
It would be paradise, to live in a world without mosquitoes. To be able to sit outside in a lawn chair on a summer evening without becoming a buffet.
Are you Neil Kaplan? The guy who does the eng dub for madara Uchiha?? I swear its like a stoned Madara Uchiha giving a lesson.
i would be curious to see and understand the True Facts of the East Asian centipede... a suggestion. i mean, would there be any comedy in the life of a venomous polyped ?
Giant water bug, I think. Is what big boy was.
Watching that egg pod hatch was one of THE most disturbing, horrifying and near unbearable things I have ever done. I know what my nightmares will be for all the rest of time
i'm left wondering who are all of those people that volunteer to be bitten by mosquitos so people can study and document the process.
Wow never thought mosquitoes to be so complicated
“And see how long you last……..  ……..till you get arrested.”
Please say it again "Demon BB"
Didn't realize Mosquitoes were this cool. I might even raise some as pets.
Moscow weetos
Maybe skeetos aren't so bad
Permethous Pena tray Divine copulas coutious interruptus Leva ranches Lavrancha extracts aracknod
"Demon baby"... accurate I see.
Love your videos. I was worried for a bit you wouldn't produce anymore after I watched them all.
A dildo wearing glasses... that's how you start a video right there👌
at this point I am starting to wonder if Jerry is even real
So...if mosquitoes use blood to make their eggs...doesn't that mean that human DNA is mixed in with the mosquitoes DNA? Or are the proteins broken down?
LMAO 3:80, I was literally thinking, ‘damn, little holes, might have to skip this part.’
i want a Mark Rebillet ft Zefrank mix !!!
Dinsorities: "You know what I love about pupas?... I get older and they stay the same age, heheheh...alright"
It doesn't matter who you are Men, women, Furrys, Serial Killers, everyone  hates  Mosquitos 🦟
Now how can I order eggs from the big one?
uggggggghhhhh
That macro footage is amazing and this was so informative. But I still can get over the urge to set them on fire. Except the elephant mosquito.
There ya go, reason why ya can’t kill all mosquitoes since they are pollinators.
3:11 i knida wonder what that is myself. . .the mouth parts look loke an assassin bug
Where did Jerry go
5:37 yet they always manage to go right next to my ear and irritate me for 30 minutes until I start hunting it with a shoe at 3 am  Edit: 10:30 so now your telling me if I just stop breathing all my issues will fly away  Edit: 10:57 ......fuuuuuc-
Very much appreciated the warning early on about holes. Also wish I listened I dont know why I was an idiot but curiosity got me
I hope he’s not one of those guys who finds every opportunity to make one of his borderline jokes at all the mixed company parties he attends.
Funny commentary and pretty entertaining ngl XD u got my sub sir
This video and the one on ticks has helped with my phobias. not saying he should do one on roaches but Im more comfortable with images of ticks and mosquitos cuz I hear Zefranks voice in my head saying something silly.
I do really respect all the effort and enthusiasm you put into making this. Thank you for all of it, you are awesome and I admire you
4:40 heLLO
So educational yet entertaining!
16:25 mosquito song  so i dont have to guess again and again where it is every time i wanna listen to it
So... I grew up with the Discovery Channel. Back when they did... Discovery stuff. I think Zefrank has replaced - with the help of many qualified type of folk - the entirety of the Discovery Channel at this point. I mean, fuck yeah. It's informative AND funny and I can tell mosquito jokes that no one will ever understand now.
mosquitos BEBEHS
Thx for the warning ⚠️
You are a genius:))
D E M O N  B A B Y
The large brown one @3:07 looked like a belostomatid
Fantastic!!!!   Love it
4:19 I had to stop and catch my breath from laughing so much.
that ending song was PERFECT!
Dude I was a research assistant in the lab with the landing mosquitoes, it was so surreal to see that footage in a Zefrank vid.
Do one on the spotted lantern fly!
I think that all mosquito species that spread human diseases should be eradicated.
You know how people feed movie scripts to an AI and let them write their own script? I want someone to do that with Zefrank's videos.
How about..... True Facts: The Coronavirus.
Sizing on your shirts is awful. Unless you're short and fat.
Is there a way to have those subtitled on spanish?? I want to show it to everyone!
Fun fact, mosquotos are THE most dangerous animal to humans. Killed more humans than anything, including other humans. Its bananas
say baby one more time.
Actually didn't know Mosquitos pollinate flowers. Maybe we shouldn't exterminate them all after all. :?
Ze, you make me smile.
Fuck all mosquitos except those elephant ones, they alright.
Ok I didn't know mosquitoes are pollinators 🙌 they just earned my respect. 💐✌🤎
Awesome as always
I …I am being attacked by the mosquito mafia! Please help they are demanding my iron and I’m anemic!
This is a random video suggested to me, but damn the narrator is amazing 🤣. Also damn I didn't know there was so much shite about these stupid bugs. I usually hate random YouTube suggestions, but this video is absolutely amazing 🤣 Thank you for making this.
Dragonflies are one of our greatest allies against these disgust creatures.
Once I got bitten by mosquito to my mentula and it was the worst sucking I had.
All mosquitoes that feed on people need to be exterminated end of story.
4:40 You're welcome.
That's why you don't ask what something is good for...... you'll end up with a grumpy chicken 🤣   That's gold 👍
Now that bebbe dead bebbe 🤣
Absolutely awesome...  And I laugh my arse off each video. Thanks!
I didn't see any of the Clinton, Bilderberg, Bezos or other mosquito species on here...? I'm confused.
Very entertaining video
“It looks like Snufflufugus reimagined as a dildo.”  I laughed out loud at that one!🤣🤣🤣
Lol! He does look like a depressed ghost.  Also the search history joke got me. I dropped my food when I laughed. Thankfully, it was just grapes. 😂😂
surprisingly funny
15:15 😂😂😂😂 females in the genus triazafjjfufu 😂😂😂 i repeated this portion of the video so many times. Funniest thing ever.
Someone make a 10 hour loop of mosquito says hel-lo
Judging by the length of this video, I think you have a lot of issues with the mosquitoes, Frank lol
Thank you for teaching about the mosquito! They are a very important part of our ecosystem, being main food sources for fish, birds, bats, frogs, and many important insects!! That's the only thing I wish you had included in the video, their importance in the food chain.
HELLOO, I'M ALIVE ! :D
Mosquoitoes 😁🤣🤣
All I hear is Gus Fring
I'll hate mosquitoes I don't feel bad for those bastards
Love Your Videos! Brilliant Entertainment!
Do a video on assassin bugs
I know I'm a bit late but can you do a video on Ferrets? We have four and love the silliness that they are. There is some misconceptions about them. Like how smelly they are and how they damage things. Thanks we love your videos by the way
What animal
Love these videos, wish there were more of them posted and more often!!
Demon BABY 😅
“and now it’s getting dicked by a skeeter” is the title of my autobiography
DUDE MORE SONGS PLEASE THAT WAS INCREDIBLE
Alaskans state bird. Lol  You guys should see our crazy amount of them in my old home town Utqagivik Alaska. We are all tundra and mini pools on the North Slope.
🤨🙄😒oh these expressions? Well those are for the thumbs down…as if…
I think at 3:10 is a diving beetle
We've all lost a kid or two at the water park lol
2:07 *demon bebe*
Incredible photography, and, as usual, you should be on school curriculums. Brilliant, as always! However, mosquitos are the only insect I kill on instinct when they touch me. Not even spiders.
10:20
Sometimes I wonder why mosquitoes even exists, they're not even an integral part of the food chain.
I just realized this is the guy that made “teddy has an operation” help
I started itching everywhere as I watched this...
Flamethrowers are acceptable weapons against these
This is my national geographic
Such detail to such a tiny creature.. God is the greatest architect in the universe HalleluYAH!
I had no idea that there were good mosquitos out there. Thanks for another great learning experience!
Do the tick!
You sir, are insane.  God bless you ❤👍🏽
6:39 kinda sounded like alastor 😳
I'm itchy
Mosquitos are 3D printed from their Pupae stage
Mosquitos suck.
YOUTUBE DIDN'T NOTIFE ME, WHYYYYYY,  love u and yt anyway... BUT WHYY (hehe) (I drank way too much coffee!)
*Pours salt*
Lalalalalala lamok..(toto) lamok.. (toto) lamok.. (toto)
Catchy little mosquito song
The beauty of creatures becomes much clearer when they are shown with their relatives. The SR-µCT video of the mosqueto head is amazing work.
This shut be funny as fuck I'm done.Why are you not on tv.
making butt joke in front of the sponsored secion 😂
FLAMETHROWER
At least this wasn't as bad as the tick video...
Can we get a scolding Jerry Compilation?
This channel is amazing.  Can anyone explain to me why the thumbs down on his videos.  I'm seriously not understanding this.  Thanks.
I have always chosen to NOT learn about mosquitoes, on purpose!  I mean, look at all of that!  It puts the most terrifying, grossest, horror movies I've ever seen to shame, and... it's friggin REAL!!  Lol, my point is just that, I would only agree to learn how mosquitoes live by watching it told in the style of, "zefrank1."  It was still hard to watch.  But instead of being in the fetal position in some corner rocking back and forth after learning about mosquitoes.  I found myself laughing out loud afterward.
Mosquito says HELLO!
Butt first.. sorry.. but first LOL
...and that kids is how I learned about mosquitoes
This video made me want a chicken video lol
Zefrank... Please, don't grow up. Stay a big behbeh forever.
This reminds me of the movie strange wilderness  XDD
Is anyone else watching this and feeling EXTREMELY ITCHY
I'm actually currently waging war with aedis aegyptis in my local area right now (there's a fuck ton of them here specially this season). And after hearing that bit about them having some bits of me game me an existential crisis.
elephant mosquitos are now my favorite mosquitos
The Elephant Mosquito: "Hel-LO!"  Gawdz, had me cracking up every time...  And Aegyptes: "like how Lady GaGa would come out on stage, very dramatic...  Or "Snufflupagus, but re-imagined as a dildo wearing glasses..."  LOL  This vid had me howling!  And at 8:18 the Sebithes (I hope I spelled that correctly) Mosquito, was ever a skeeter that pretty?  Holy shit.  The song at the end...  **snort-giggle**  Dammit, man, I'm glad to see another video by you!  This one was, well... Brilliant.  (Sorry, couldn't resist)
Anthropomorphizing insects is a ridiculous tangent in this video!!
Everyone asks for a True Facts: Jerry...  Jerry is ZF's alter ego... spoiler
The thing at 3:08 looks like a giant water bug.  They have extremely painful bites, so be careful.  That said, I have a distinct memory my Dad nonchalantly bringing one in the house one day to ask me what it was because he didn't know. XD No, it did not bite us, and that's not how I know it has a painful bite, lol.  I just know from research.
What makes the episode funny is the voices
"behbeh" - zefrank1
god the babies coming out made me so uncomfortable
The way he said bebbes actually cured my trypophobia
Anyone else just love the way that zefrank says "babies?"
the rooOOOf
As a Louisiana man, I'm here to learn my enemy.
Yesssssssssssss! TYYYY
Good Lord this video makes me itch 😖
Ah yes gods bloodsuckers what a wonderful pes…. I mean beautiful creation.
Love your content, But #FightLikeHell, I'll be soon un-subscribing if you are not also available on Rumble
Hello....
So mosquitos can literally smell us breathing, fuck.
That one hatching @ 4:42 emerges as I imagine Marilyn Manson would. LMMFAO @ "poo-paw-tay". I thought zefrank was attempting to say "pool party".  SMMFH. 🤦‍♀️
I got an entire one minute and forty seconds into this one before laughing so hard I was crying.
Im gonna be honest i watch most of these for the humor but i genuinely had no idea mosquitos are polinators and a few percent actually drink blood. SERIOUSLY IM 20 AND NEVER KNEW THIS
I am ashamed to admit how ignorant I have been about these creatures. However, I am not ashamed of the deep disgust I still have toward them
My most hated insect on the planet no cap.
This is my favorite YouTuber by far the only one I give the full respect of watching ads
Your soo funny bro. brilliant edits. Nicely done.
There was a mosquito flying near me
This was bit too long, but great to see you are doing more videos.
Mosquitos, or as I like to call them: God's only mistake.
The pupi looks like a weird alien skull with horns
Omg this was actually great I hate mosquitoes glad to learn they're purposeful can you do the crane fly aka mosquitoe hawk too?
I love the way you say baby
Hilariously educational,  great job.
Good video! I still hate mosquitoes, though.
thank u to all the ppl that allowed their footage to be used! it was super entertaining - one of the best truefacts yet!
The world needs more zefrank1 absolutely amazing 😆🤣
Warning people as the thing is happening... you know what you did -.-
My wife told me to pass on to you her heartfelt thanks for the trypophobia warning in the beginning. "That was very nice."
As someone with that thing where a lot of holes freak me out, I decided to go to the comment section to be safe.
*demon bebë*
First video im watching from this channel. Funny asl and super informational! Love it
Amazing 💪💪
this one was a little light on good jokes, but his voice still carries it through.
Mosquitos are pollinators too?! Dammit, now we have to keep them around. -_-
So uh.... if you slap a mosquito while it was feeding on your leg/arm,... does the needle get stuck in your skin or?....
bebis
if mosquitoes didn't make you itch with their bites, and couldn't transfer diseases, then i wouldn't mind getting bit by 'em. like yeah sure, i'll donate a lil blood to the upkeep of the food chain. BUT THE ITCHING.... and chances of horrible disease :(
Anyway, when do we start the Mosquito Genocide?
ok, so I will ask the question that everyone wants to know, when does the Mosquito song available on Spotify?
Zefrank's knowledge to hilarity ratio is the greatest I have ever seen in any form of media. Fucking legend
"HELLO" im crying  then he did it agian.
full disclaimer, this is not criticism and nor is it meant to cause offence... but i get the feeling this guy may possibly be gay
Can we get a true facts about humans talking about us like the animals
I call them as devil flies. They are the most annoying creatures in the world.
Wow. Its amazing the effort and research you put into your videos. You even made your own song  Lol
👹demon baby👹
Sounds like Morgan Freeman on ecstasy!
While I appreciate their life cycle, I still hate them and wish death upon their whole blood sucking species.
"DEMON BABIE"
Fact, mosquitoes suck
HELLOOOOOO ~~~~
True fact: all mosquitoes deserve to fucking die a slow and painful death
Disgusting!! I hated giving that a thumbs up.
That's familiar
Absolutely fascinating! I love your style, and I love your videos. Thank you so much!
HELLO! ^_^
Kill em with fire. Not sorry 🤷‍♂️
Tropophobia & misophonia owner here Watching first minute took me half an hour
Love your videos. I wish you had a video once a day. I would totally pay
Love the Pharrell style song at the end!
Evil demons
It's crazy how this is absolutely fascinating documentary work with unseen videos from researchers while Zefrank blasts jokes about butts. Great content every time.
I hate how the babies swim! 😡😡
Almost makes me feel bad for swatting them
I was waiting till you got to the proboscis (mouth). That stuff is literally nightmare fuel, It looks like 6 little octopus arms wriggling around under your skin, slurping up that delicious cherry soda.
Anyone else feel like itching after watching this lol
Now I'm all itchy.
I love the mosquito song lmao
Since lots of mosquito larvae where made from our blood and dna in a sense that technically means we would have millions of technically brothers and sisters. When you think about it that kinda makes sense since blood contains dna like everything else in our bodies (except sweat I think)…Nature is weird.
never a dull moment. loves the song too
You need to leave the porn alone for awhile
Snort snort holy damn
Yeah...still trying to find a reason why they are the slightest bit important to any ecosystem. I'll keep pouring bleach into their little nurseries until I do.
*You don't want that mixed in with the porn. People might get the wrong idea.* I love these videos so much.
If only we could kill the human blood sucky ones
Wow these jokes suckkkkkkkkk
I definitely need more of that mosquito song in my life
Me at the beginning ( ⊙‿⊙)
ZeFrank is the finest thing on YT and no, you can't fight me about it! ZeFrank FOREVER.
Huggbees and zefrank under the same week. Awesome week!
all that just to fucking zapped my by bug racket
Mosquito eggs: exists Me: * dies of trypophobia *
thanks i now am educated on the nightmare that are mosquitos
So I have a bunch of unknown mosquito children due to the random blood donation from bites?
I love these videos
The part where u said breach ur but and spreed em made me laugh so damn hard
Do an axolotl please
I just googled the elephant mosquito just because of the ¡Helloou! part JAJAJAJA
The only reason that I don't wish the death of all mosquitos, is because I'd be afraid somewhere a bat might go hungry.
I really enjoyed the mosquito song too
I am so glad that you are still a thing! Bring back that cool drawing widget!
Yeah, Jerry! You want talking chickens too?!
This is a lot more learning than I usually expect from the zefrank1 videos. Loved it though.
The elephant mosquito is a true friend of humanity. I love you champs keep eating other mosquitos 💕
Sad boob ghost...rip ghosty boi
this one made me laugh way too much
Do the cold ones podcast
They are using the dna from our blood to become smarter. They are already building rafts. Soon they will craft warships and raid our countries. All hail the mosquito empire.
great. so we are killing bees. and we wanna nuke these. but now i cant tell people theres no use for these damn blood suckers. but oh nooo the pollinate.
Dude, fuck these things, too death
Do Gibbons please.
I don’t know How this video was in my feed, but I love it!!!🥰 I spit out my wine and couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I have Never learned so much while laughing my a$$ off! You know I Subscribed…right!👍🏾🤩 the way you say” babies”!🤣🤣🤣
I like the explanation on how the baby mosquitoes breathe, a common way to stop unwanted mosquito babies in small pools of water is to pour a thin layer of oil.
Damn I keep watching the Teddy operation video
What the dog doin
Terrific.
We should find a way to harness some of the proteins of Mosquito saliva and turn it into pain relievers.
Sad little ghosts.... God that's gonna stay with me forever, they just look so depressed 🤣
You, dearest Sir, are, besides Sir AvE, the most idiotic, genious and hilarious creator of zhe contents here on zhe interyoutubes. Zenk you many manies. (Yes, I is zhe germanly speakings and ze drunks lol)
Thats why it feels good to put oil or something ontop of stagnent water and watch larvae die.
Don't judge
Getting dizzy now ...
Oh shite! He said Kinkie Bastards?
Mosquito are my faves idc abt the one million people killed each year
Love your videos! 😂
How the heck are you this amazing!?
water caterpillar
"It's mosquitos all the way down."
DONT SAY BEAUTIFUL!
I am a college professor who is teaching anthropology.  Whenever I teach about primates, I use your Aye aye, tarsier, and lemur videos to keep everyone amused and educated.  Would you consider more primate videos?  Please?  Let me tell you, Bonobos are plenty weird.  All sorts of material there.
I was hoping for a 17min documentary bit. Instead I got some weirdo inserting his cringy old guy humor anywhere he could. sigh.
Now we need one about love bugs
And all of this evolved from a explotion?
Mosquitos are pollinators - huh, now that's something I did not expect.
Brilliant video many thanks for all your efforts ,, oh and I especially love the way you narate lmao ....... F'in brilliant ......  I have also learnt about Mosquitos now as well so yea you make a good teacher pmsfl ......    Not only Entertaining  but very Informative as well !!!!
Rip Johnston
Does that, "HellOOOOOOO!" remind anyone else of those cursed old animated emoticon banners?
what about the tadpole shrimp . they are also very weird . make a video about it maybe . don´t ask why . my comment is just a random comment
DUDE, you funny af
ｄｅｍｏｎｂｅｂｅ
I love your vids zefrank please never stop i wanna learn about the world through your hilariously informative mind
See how long ya last
omg. Couldn't watch the holes part. I feel icky now.
Well worth the wait!
LALALALALALA LAMOK LAMOK !
"convulsive" is my new favourite word-- and I'll find all kinds of inappropriate ways of using it..
"Getting dicked by a skeeter"... Lost my sh*t on that one! Thank you Frank! :D
I feel even more disgusted by the mos-quee-toss.
No mention of the potential of a malaria vaccine? They're making impressive strides towards it.
“…and that’s the thing about kindergarten, there’s always a biter”
I can't listen to this narrator.. Unfortunately because the video seems really interesting. Nonetheless I had to quit after 2 minutes. His voice and accent is sooo annoying :/
I love kissing my girlfriend's mouth parts 😋
Can mosquitoes just disappear please (also cockroaches)
I want the elephant mosquito to be the only mosquito species on earth, i dont hate all mosquitos, i only hate the ones that take my blood, and inject the itch juice in my skin, and also has the chance to give me a deadly disease.
i was eating before this video, now i don't want to eat ever again
One of your best videos ever
Oh great, after the bird, now the mosquitoe song stucks in my head too
Well done, ze Frank! Your best video yet, and they're all awesome. Keep it up! Fantastic of you to mention all of your references, classy move. BTW, have you met Morgan Freeman?  ;)
These were great educational and entertaining. I feel like the cheeky humour would be great for kids minus the more explicit jokes. Would you consider doing something similar for the primary school age group I know my nephew would really enjoy them?
I still hate mosquitoes, burn them down
Finally!!! I can't get enough of these. Seriously if I could only sub to one channel it would be yours simply for these tru facts videos.
The small organ bit...zefrank knows the audience so well
it’s SO interesting how different mosquitos lay eggs. skillfully laying them above a waterline OR attacking competition from a different subspecies is impressive for something that has the brain the size of an atom
anyway the segment where the mosquito sucks blood incredibly in depth made me so squirmy and uncomfortable. going to try sprinting from any i see from now on. terrifying
obsessed w this series. don’t stop
Toxorhynchites has now become my spirit creature.
I honestly cannot think of any other content on YouTube that makes me laugh out loud repeatedly as this series always does. Zefrank, thank you for continuing to share your talent with us.
These are the most annoying things ever when you’re trying to sleep and you hear that high pitched buzzing. Turn the light on to try to kill it and it’s vanished until you turn the light off. Rrrrgh!
thank you for sharing this amazing video! Love Love it
"Today there's no more privacy!"          -A. Moshkito
I hate them, but the planet needs them. But i still hate them
Dragonflies are one of my favorite insects, not just because they look awesome, but because they eat mosquitoes at every stage of their own life and every stage of the mosquitoes lives. They also eat a fuck ton of them.
funny how i killed one last night and blood was on my wall. fuck them. they are worse then bed bugs and hornets.
This is the best fucking discovery channel bullshit I've ever heard!
Tiny surveillance cam
WHAT ARE THE RAMIFACATIONS OF REMOVING ALL MESQUITOS FROM THE EARTH?
Watching the mosquitos mouth part wriggling under the skin was ghastly...
I hate this...
Have you ever thought about making a video on the potoo. The jokes you could make up about that nightmare muppet would be hilarious!
Can-opener larvae: Phantom midge
If a mosquito takes blood from me and lays eggs, does that make me the father?
So... when is that album dropping zefrank? I know I'm not the only one that's mesmerized by your vocals, funky beats and outrageous lyrics. Still got that ostrich and koala song stuck in my head haha
It 3 am and totally amazed this shiet.
Will you do a TrueFacts on tadpole shrimp?
What are mosquitoes good for? It’s a valid question. Replace mosquito with any other creature that seems to be only a nuisance and the answer is likely the same… it’s greatest purpose is to be prey.  Mosquitos supplement the diet of countless reptiles, amphibians, spiders and fish. And are in some cases an animals primary source of food. It is quite possible that without them, entire food webs and ecosystems could collapse. So there you have it.   The diseases they transmit to animals could also act as a natural population control that selectively culls weaker individuals. Let’s not forget about the pollination! I was today years old when I learned that!
Do True Facts About The !($<×;! Pls
The beginning sets the tone very well
welp I'm never swimming in a lake.
This guy is a genius lmao
Your videos make me laugh so hard!!
"Butt first... But first, a word from our sponsors."  <<< wins the internet for today.
“Ask a chicken what people are good for” damn jerry, you should’ve stayed quite
helLOOO
Am I the only one that wants to get the mosquito says hello song as my new ringtone? Might have to figure out how to make it happen!
What about doing something in your style on the terrifying zombie ants or those types of parasites
Wow these clips are so good!
bone chilling; a thoroughly disgusting species, almost as baad as homo sapiens
It's like aliens
I hate mosquitoes but this actually… kind of made me appreciate them? Ok, that’s a lie, fvck mosquitoes. But they’re still fascinating.
johnstons organ..... heh heh... shut up ... lmao
We love you! Thank you for putting so much time and research and creativity and comedy. Could you please make a episode of your bloopers please and thank you 🥰
Is Ze your first name?
When he said the bit about small organ it made me laugh and then 3 seconds later “grow up.” Man knows his audience.
Super educational
This video made me so itchy
8:53 "Crabhole creep"
Key words in a Ze Frank production: "Jerry..." "Behbeh" "Let's back up a bit" "That is how a BLANK do." "Butt first - Sorry." "Sorry, dad joke." "That's even worse..."
Anyone else wanna genocide all mosquitoes?
I could do without all the dumb jokes.
4:41 he- *LLO* 6:40 Hel- *LO* 16:56 mosquito says *HELLO*
Never thought I would go soft for these pesky bugs lol
Haha good information and visuals but the jokes… uh to be honest yah we get it you’re trying to be funny …. But theres no need ..ok? But overall great video 🤩
Love this commentary
logic... trying to convince myself people are not food.... if i have no choice in the if in the end people are food no matter what i want then that makes this a lot simpler for me.... choose to die yes or no be food yes or no they can't both be yes.... maybe only the suicides are food ? that makes sense... im sorry im seriously wondering if people are food in a metaphysical sense? that feel like a lie, this concerns me and i dont expect you to fgive a fuck.... why are you even bothering to try to relate to me i didnt ask for you to do that... you tell me people are not food and my firsth thought is i dont trust you cuz how can you be sure... its just something i want to talk abou tits not something that needs your opinions can you tell me people are not food and have me believe you... see its not your problem dont worry about it.... #Youtube #Foxnews i wouldnt give a fuck if i thought i was food but no im looking at people and thinking are you guys food for some it....
If only there was a way for you to do a collab video with David Attenborough...
zefrank1 is legitimately one of the the best youtubers in the world. 10/10 content
I laughed harder at "and now it's gettin' dicked by a skeeter"  than I have at anything in a very, very long time. My entire body hurts
"There are mosquito beibehs out there that were made from parts of you"  My virginity shield is so strong, not even mosquitos want me
I was wondering if they contributed literally anything to the ecosystem. And now I know, they are pollinators.
3:07😂😂
Jerry reveal
👹DÈÆMØÑ BÂBŸ👹
That butt first
The attempted humor added nothing for me but only took away from the video. 👎
And what about the tune at the end …. 16:27
So.... since Mosquito's drink our blood to lay eggs Does that make us the other parent?
The way you say "Babies" gets me everytime ! XD
Well then, If I didn’t hate mosquitos already, I sure hate them now-
Mosquitoes are so annoying that even mosquitoes have mosquitoes
Dicked by a skeeter. - ZeFrank brilliant, bravo! bravo!
"No mother is perfect, who has not lost a child in the park" hahahahah
I literally cried with laughter watching this. Thank you so much for making these videos.
Is it weird that I wanna listen to Mosquito Says Hello on Spotify?
10:28 don’t breathe got it, 10:56 fuuuuuuck nvm I guess.
i was cringing the whole video. Mosquitos are truly awful
this is so fucking classic.  i have shared it with everyone i love.  "HELLOOOOOOW"
Wow it’s so nice to see your channel thriving,I used to watch your videos years ago:) love your content!
That ending had me CRYING
Immm already in the kitchen, AND ALREADY EATING WHAT DO I DO?
I love the way he says baby 🤣
What happened to jerry
Please youtube, don't recommend this channel again...! The commentary is ridiculous. It's too vulgar for children, and too stupid and filled with jokes about butts and condoms. I don't want to ever be associated with this brain dead channel or it's followers.
Great, I was hoping I could scratch for over 17 minutes. Love your videos. <3
I know the puffin video is old but I would totally love a puffin muffin or puffin stuffin shirt 😁😁
When an entire video is quote-worthy, you know you're watching Zefrank.
I just want to thank my 10th grade AP Bio teacher for introducing me to this because I’ve been laughing for 20 minutes straight   Mr. Johnston if you’re out there you’re the best 😂
just want to make it known that i got my science teacher into these videos best day of my life
Zefrank is amazing, he’s funny yet educational.
UP CLOSE MICROSCOPIC MAGNIFIED  HIGH DETAIL VIDEOS WITH NO 1080P HAS TO BE A CRIME!
I’m so glad a malaria vaccine exists now
One of the best ones ever ZeFrank.
Mos-ka-wee-toes!
Best biology channel
This makes me itch
Why does everything breathe out of its butt
4:34 looks like a daft punk vid
"Demon Behby!👹"
The song at the end was beautiful! Haha nice work!
Love how the narrator cant help breaking into a laugh after saying something funny
Throughout the video I find myself itching.
The array of references to scientific papers makes me happy.
"DEAD BEBE"
Glad to see u back mate
Okay. I didn’t know that mosquitos were pollinators. They can stay, I will never wish to exterminate them every again. Thanks, mosquitos. I guess you can have some of my blood sometimes.
Did you know, they have human DNA So some people on some country might be killing people everyday
moss-key-toes beh bes
This is F’n great!! Very educational but definitely not boring af. Great job.
Aedes Aegypti is a real threat in tropical areas (like the one that I live) - even though we are "tired" of hearing of it, that was one of the most didatics videos I saw
This video made me itchy
Now I know how the mosquitoes know exactly where to bite that I can’t hit them.
I hate mosquitoes, I’m always the one being bitten.
Today i learned there is actually a mosquito species that actually are cool
WOW .  Very informative. Thank You.
The only reason Im watching this is to know my enemy better and absolutely obliterate them
i had way too many mosquitos this summer, so watching this is like desensitizing for my phobia XD thanks
another reason god is an a (ss) hole.
Amazing video. Thank you for crediting the people who made some of these videos. I'm fighting skills overtime so I'm very familiar with some of this footage
Damn....never knew they pollinated flowers!
Hellooo♫
Thanks that was nice video
This is the very best episode.
The "HELLO" mosquito reminded me of genie. I was expecting a " TEN THOUSAND YEARS TRAPPED IN A LAMP WILL GIVE YA SUCH A CRICK IN THE NECK!" JOKE
"These contains Johnston's organ, named after Johnston who must've had a tiny organ"  He did my man dirty
There’s another mosquito that eats other mosquitoes as well, commonly called the “Gallinipper”. Unfortunately, it’s so aggressive and robust that it will just as eagerly turn on you
My pores itch now, thanks asshole
This is one of your best videos, I learned a lot and had to try really hard to not crack up at work. 🤣
Demon bebes
"HELLO"
What the hell.......
I appreciate mosquitos more, now I will squash them knowing I killed an amazing creature that breaths though their butt
extended remix of mosquito song on itunes please!
okay I will stand by the opinion that all mosquitoes are bad and deserve to die, ill just change it to the ones that fly near me and want to suck my blood (and the elephant mosquitoes can live too i guess)
ok, but how well done the part at 5:19 is. he waits the right amount of time for you to register what he said and have a giggle about it before saying the "grow up" part, it really worked perfectly

I had no idea mosquitoes are pollinators.  Fascinating.
jesus kill all the mosquito with fire and napalm
Permission to slap them suckers, sir!
Does anyone else hear snape
Good video. I would subscribe if I weren't already.
Mosquitoes are the worst lol specially when you are allergic to them
This longer video absolutely ruled. Especially since it shed some light on one of the animals just about everyone has an experience with. Oh and the egg bombing was pretty tight too!
6:40
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I live for the blood draws, blood draws, blood draws~ I live for the blood draws draws, live for the blood draws draws~
Fantastic video. Great balance of genuine information and entertainment 😊
Yes, show the tryps before warning the trypos.
I’m feeling itchy just watching this
All I need to know about my arch nemesis. :::holds breath in the woods:::
There needs to be a school version of this. Keep the humor, take out parts like "being dicked by a skeeter" (which made me spit out my drink with laughter, BTW). These are better than ANY other informational videos or school lessons.  Well done, sir.
Mosquito says he-loo ☺️
Heelloo!!
I am both repulsed and entertained.
they are pointless and shouldnt exist
2:00 imagine you in a pool and someone poop in front of you
Was the closing song done by the guys over at Bad Lip Reading?
I've never wanted to slap my screen so bad.
Thank you. I will definitely use this newly learnt information in the never ending battle against these fuckers
did anyone else grab a can of bug spray while watching this?
ugh, I was on a date one time when a person asked me about bats and seriously said "what's the point of them?". My mind was like "b****, what's the point of you?" but my answer went to an ecological perspective, rather than a moral perspective. I got really offended for my bat friends for a second.
Introduces some fish to the mosquito pond
YES....my trypophobia is at level 10 !!
Return of the king
I can’t wait till they’re all extinct
17 minutes ?! OH HAPPY DAYS
"And now it's getting dicked by a skeeter." I fcking _love_ this channel.
Behold! The most hated animal on earth!!
That fix in post though 😅
@13:02 Ah! Now I remember why all mosquitos can go straight to hell.
OK, I legit did not know mosquitos were pollinators!! My whole life I've been cursing them and asking why they even exist! What would I do with out Zefrank?!
This video made me itchy.
This one is audio only for me sadly, I can not watch this. lol
A mosquito bite is way more scary when you see what it does under your skin!
Mosquitoes almost killed me. Therefore I've declared, as an 11-year old child, that Mosquitoes are my sworn nemesis!  The battle rages on to this very day...
"Hel-lo!" XD
"plant sperm" hahahahahaha
I wouldn’t recommend watching it while eating breakfast!
True facts they need to be eradicated
Information I hated but needed, in the right packaging! Thank you for all the hard work on this! ...and the great narration!
H e L L O
Anyone else want to see zefrank + tierzoo?
That's a funky outro track you got there Z!
On one hand, this is so interesting. On the other hand, just watching it makes me itchy
"That one time he said "boob" by mistake" and "dicked by a skeeter" lmao! These make my day!
Death to all of em
Im so happy when i see you upload
HELLLLOOOOO!!!
agh I'm itchy now. But thank you for the wonderful itch-inducing video
I want a bunch of elephant mosquitoes as pets.  They're like a poor man's butterfly 😂
now that bebe dead bebe :(
HELLO~~~ (Also, this made me really itchy kthxbye)
I love that there are some many in the science community that are willing to allow you use thier footage and research to make these videos.
I once read that the ecosystem wouldn't be much impacted if every mosquito died. Here's to society someday eradicating mosquitoes completely!
This could be the story idea for a Hollywood horror movie.
"behbies."
We need to breed and spread as many elephant mosquitoes as possible.
The only family I honestly and truly advocate for their genocide. Culicidae are the absolute worst on this planet and they have zero redeemable value. KILL THEM ALL.
Please please please keep doing insect narration videos
but how get rid of them
True Facts: The Mosquito: they should all die!
EXTREMELY funny and interesting.  Unbelievable footage!  👍👍
Vid looks cool but couldnt get passed the narrator talking soooo much to be funny . Sounds like I’m listening to Deadpool
the "grow up" just got me.
Splendid
I liked the second they said dildo
"But first" KKKKKKKKK I almost spit my coffee
What's a true fact?  A fact is inherently true...
Elephant Mosquitoes are the Anti-heroes
I am utterly fascinated and extremely grossed out at the same time watching this.
Fear the plains! Fear the deathmosquito!
I've just stumbled upon something great
I used to read book with pictures of these bastards, and peer into microscope for hours to study these suckers. So bloody well explained, and with a sense of humour. Lovely. Keep it up!
I think I was more comfortable when I thought it was just like a needle. Now those things look like the fricken Alien to me.
First by being sponsored you are already on my bad side, next your style of narrating is between cringe and childish...thumbs down
Johnston had a tiny organ 😂
Now I can hate mosquitoes more accurately
BEBBES
best youtuber!
I thought the mosquito at the beginning was Beyonce in partition... Was not disappointed...
Thanks. I hated and loved every second.
Ahhh MY ARCH NEMESIS 🤨
Reminder to self:  Stop watching ZeFrank True Facts videos over breakfast! "This looks like the inside view of a teddybear being humped by a chihuahua" 🤣🤢
my old house in central Bangkok used to have multiple elephant mosquitoes around and I even had a chance to feed them bastard mosquito babies too. We were great homies back then lol
"Oops she knocked a couple down. No mother's perfect; I mean who hasn't lost a child or two at the water park?" 🤣
Female mosquitos need some of that male mosquito sperm butt first. I’ve learned so much today!
I hate mosquitoes. I’ve killed so many that there’s a bounty on my head.
"And now it's getting d**ked by a skeeter." is what got me. I was doing good until then. 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Verily, Allah is not ashamed to set forth a parable even of a mosquito or so much more when it is bigger (or less when it is smaller) than it - 2/26 Al Baqarah
Knowledge with the best comedy EVER!!!!
I hope all the mosquitoes born from my bloodparts are getting laid om the regular
Friend: What's your favorite YouTube channel?  Me: The educational one that makes sex jokes about Mosquitoes.  Friend: Excuse Me?!  Me: Let's Back Up A Bit.
Just looking at them hatch from 0:50 made me start scratching my face, hands as if there were mosquitoes coming out from my phone 🦟....
I thought you meant that we could go to the pool if we want to try and look into a mosquito’s butt.  I suppose we can do so, regardless of what you meant.
Watching this made me feel itchy and I hate it
Hello!
He said boobs by mistake 😂😂🤣
I still want them to go extinct. This hasn't changed that.
I remember when I was 10, our neighbour kept drums of water outside UNCOVERED😂 Those drums were swarming with larvae and pupae. I'd never seen anything swim like that before. At least I knew why we had so many mosquitoes outside at night😥  Not fun
Please do raccoons!!! Trash pandas need some love 🤣🤣🤣 is it true? I heard they are almost as smart as monkeys?
Normal mosquito is slow, dramatic arrival Elephant mosquito: quick and insane
This narration is killing me 😂
Still uploading in 720p.
9:17 That's a mosquito on a string. I'm dead.
Me watching this: "KILL THEM!! KILL THEM ALLL !! DIEEEEEEEEEE"
2:11 Demon baby button
Hi Im Dale
These larvae are here to chew bubblegum and eat others ass first. And they're too small to chew bubblegum.
"It's mosquitoes all the way down"
I really like the mosquito song
ah yes poo-pah-teh
As a person who is allergic to mosquitoes, looking at this was horrifying and made me check my arms every minute or so, just in case I had one on me...
You're telling me they POLLINATE? so they have a PURPOSE? so I can no longer feel totally guiltless in wishing for their extinction?!? 😫
2:26 When real life looks a lot like the early stages of spore.
Horrible!!!!!!!! I’m itching now
This video is freaking amazing and absolutely disgusting. Liked and subscribed!!! Can't wait to see more!!! 😬😳😩
“Here come the BEBES” 🤣🔥🔥🔥
Mosquitoes larvae clean a certain type of bad stuff in water that nothing else can.
4:41 heLLo!!
This was a mistake watching after getting bit up by mosquitoes all day…
"The mosquito "beybeys" will eat the other mosquito "beybeys" and so on.. "  lmao idk y but this had me rollin 🤣😂  i enjoyed the whole video.  Great job bro.
new true facts! this day is going to a good one.
You found a species of mosquito I don't wish to kill I'm impressed.
its too cold now and the mosquittos have left for this year... good thing too or i'd be randomly slapping my arms and neck a lot more while watching this.
Jerry, trigonometry is not a genus of mosquito.
"Like a surgeon operating on a patient buried in a ball pit" 😆
I still remember when i used to catch mosquito and put them on water or drop them rock
This was extremely funny and interesting to watch
These things are literally born to suck out blood
Well that certainly earned a sub.
Alright,from now on Elephant Mosquitoes are excepted from the hated insects list.
i'm literally allergic to mosquitoes and i'm stoked that there's a species out there that i can respect. nothing but love for elephant mosquitoes and their cannibalism <3
I think I finally understand what niche that mosquitoes fill in the environment
I was scratching my entire body throughout the video.....
This made me hate mosquitoes even more >:'(
Just jackknife under the water and let your butt breach
3:06 for those interested, that's a giant water bug or toe biter.
8:35 basically the time it turn 18 it's all or nothing
As an entomologist specialising in mosquito biology, I highly approve of this well-researched and accurate episode of True Facts. I particularly appreciate the effort you've taken to add references and acknowledge original creators/researchers. Too much digital theft goes unpunished. One inconsequential correction I'd like to make that would've made the information 100% accurate: 5:03 this insect is a male midge from the Chironomidae and is understandably mistaken for a mosquito. It's used again later in the video. If there are any questions people would like to ask, I'd be happy to answer them. BTW, Sabethes spp. and Toxorhynchites spp. are my favourites.
0:19
That's why we have chemicals raid them
Mosquito type beat on replay
So everyone has been a dad to a mosquito baby...
So many weird flying buhggies
So if a mosquito gets in the house and starts *destroying* your ankles it's a female?  How much water do they need to multiply?
I tried, I made it 5 and a half minutes before my entire body got all itchy, see you in the next one
At 1:38 that shape looks like the state of Wisconsin!
Mosquito won’t bite me no matter what an Idk why
Just came here to say fuck mosquito's.
i hate mosquitoes but damn is his video cool. 4:16 is so badass it's like a scene in a superhero movie or when an anime character is unleashing their secret power.
For my job I have to feed mosquitoes... this video made my job horrifying
6:22 Smh so far I see no difference between female mosquitos and female humans, both are blood suckers
That ending song is just too good
You are a true master of this craft. Love!
That sub you got at 10:38 pm central time....that was me.
drink one sip of water every time you hear ‘mosquito BEBE’.
That didn't feel like 17 minutes at all
You're back!
😂😂😂😂😂
The song is a banger tho. Zefrank is a sleeper music composer. I need more "Mosquito says ✨helloo~✨" in my life
I almost missed that song at the end XDD So glad I didn't!
but first, sorry, but first
Hellooo!  oO wOo
*knocks on door* Helloooooo! 😂
For the first time in my life, I can literally feel my skin move...
Now that Baby dead Baby luv the way he said Baby
Soooooo massively breed elephant mosquitos and give them laser guns?
This guy just keeps getting better
Super informative and super funny as always!
I don't care about the environmental damage, I want to exterminate every single Mosquito
Writing was good on this episode, lots of laughs
i still find it great that i learn more about animals from these than i do like hour long 'official' david attenborough documentaries or whatever where it's like "Here's a lion. Look at it for five seconds. We're not going to tell you anything about the lion aside from what you're actively looking at anyway. Okay, now here's shit guilt tripping you about global warming" ect
I never thought I’d hear an explanation of a mosquitos mouth parts involving a heist analogy… I don’t know why I’d expect any less on this channel!
I’m guessing elephant mosquitos are what we’ve always called “skeeter eaters”
God the songs at the end are always such bops
Love the video, and the song especially; makes me harken back to the old days of Throw Up.
2:57
Little bebeies 😂 he says that so many hilarious times!! 😂
This is more understandable and educational that actual articles
I once watched helplessly as a mosquito flew away with my blood in its belly. Fair play to you, momma mosquito. You win this round.
3:19 this reminded me of Rhett, from Rhett and Link, screaming "Are you ready to pupate!" xD 👌🏻
The only insect that has no purpose except to feed on others. I’m not saying others don’t eat them, disease carrying pestilence!
Who's here watching this while Mosquitos swarming you?
Why is this actually informative??
That pronunciation of ibiza was too good, do you speak spanish?
Why tf don't skeeters numb me tho??? It may be small af but it still hurts enough to make me flinch when they insert their fuckin straws.
This is brilliant 🤣🤣🤣🤣
This one was amazing! I died at "Hel-LO!" 😂
I stumbled upon this thumbnail a couple times while looking for something to watch while I lunch, and I have skipped it because I was about to eat, and I know how this channel handles itself.... After 1 minute of run time, I am so glad I took my own advise lol
Do you want to see the definition of “Blind Panic” played out in real life? Stick a Goldfish in with those Rat-tails.   The larva’s natural instinct is to drop from the surface for deeper water when in danger. But when the danger IS below you, waiting to eat you, then it sucks to be you. and Goldfish do like their food to move, it’s the wiggle factor that does it for them.
This is awesome. 🤣
If you go to 2:56, pause, put the speed on 0.25x, turn the volume up as far as it can go and then press play....well, how about you be the judge of your own nightmares. They WILL come.
I wanted to watch this. Lots of tiny holes don't bother me. But something about them being born. Nope.
"This episode is sponsored by Brilliant, learn to think" not even 10 seconds into this and Im already laughing
Wow I feel really itchy all of a sudden.
Butt 1st HAHAHAHA!! 38 years old and ass jokes still get me every time.
Da bebes
That was a giant water bug also known as the toe biter.
"mosquito BEB BEHS"
Surprised there was no Sonic or Blanka jokes for the mosquito pupa, can't unheard the sonic spin dash sound
Bumper car reference only 40+ people understand!
That entrance is some Nosferatu level shit.
Great video
Hahaha mosquitos all the way down. Turtles all the way down.
"It's like how lady gaga would come out on stage"  That was so... accurate.
The answer my chickens would give to "What are humans good for?": Humans are good for bringing us treats and giving us back massages. (They are spoiled pets)
Trypophobia sounds weird until you see this
Thanks for this algorithm :P
So what I'm hearing is all mosquitoes are evil just some more than others and we should find anyway to kill them if we can 😂 jk
all bangers
Frank <3 you always make me smile, I love your witty comedy.
so where's the link to the ending song? thats a jam!
heLOOOOOOOO
LOL. Like watching Sir Richard A. on crack. I love it. Also, elephant mosquitoes are my favorite mosquitoes now.
its crazy how different strains of life have evolved into mosquitos, humans, cats, worms, they are all so different
The bebes
Elephant mosquitoes are now my only favorite mosquitoe
Not surprised this monster has 17 minutes of content
I've never laughed so hard out loud while learning interesting information in my life.
The ways he says “babies” gets me all the time 😂
So we are just going to gloss over the fact that Ze glossed over the fact that he glossed over that word he could not pronounce? That's glossary!
Mosquitoes wake up everyday and choose violence
Very sad that you didn't say mosscüeeto the whole video.
I laughed and learned , thank you zefrank
Comparing a mosquito to Lady Gaga = spot on
great now im afraid of tiny mosquitoes
I wish all documentaries were like this.
Before you get arrested!
Kill ‘em
I miss a show with ze Frank but this will do to scratch my itch for now 😅😁
Thank you
I hate them even more now
Damn crab hole pedo squitos
The most useless God made creature next to man, mosquitos
Now that Bebe ded Bebe 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Now watch ass they dance li- sorry, as they dance like Lorraine from Seinfeld to reach the surface and breathe through their ass like George on a date.
So I have learned things and really like Toxorynchites! Yay! Also this was very funny.
thanks, now i feel slightly bad about killing them.
Definitely the funniest one yet
I have never had so much fun learning weird things I never knew I should learn! You're the best, and I love this channel!
0:22 lol
Moss Kweetoes
Love the song! Almost as classic as Koala in the Rain.
I just got arrested at the YMCA pool...
When I get to Heaven, my first question...."Mosquitos??? Really???"
Wow, I didn't know mosquitos were interesting. Too bad for them I hate them. I wish I could torch them, throw flames at them everytime they're around.
I used to think the only good mosquito is a dead mosquito. But now I know better. there is the elephant mosquito who eats other mosquitos and doesn't even bite people
This video almost made me lost my job from hysterical laughter.
man, these videos are a delight!
All I heard was elephant mosquitoes eat other mosquitoes and don't suck human blood....so I should buy elephant mosquitoes
Who wrote the asshole script? Is it really necessary to imagine that? This is interesting, doesn't need that at all.
This video confirmed to me that mosquitoes are evil
I remember hearing somewhere that Malaria has killed more people in human history than any other single factor. Mosquitos will fuckyaup
Thank you for adding a trypophobia warning.  And if anyone’s wondering what mosquitoes are actually good for in the animal kingdom, they recycle biomass extremely fast compared to waiting for the animals they feed on to die and decompose.  It’s like that for most blood-feeding parasites. Now if only they didn’t spread disease causing parasites…
Dale?!
I still hate them.
This video was great. That said, I hope in the near future this is relabeled as The Mosquito (extinct) :)
“pictured here with a match so you can get a sense for how hard it is from them to pick a smoking habit” is a freaking amazing sentence. 13:38
Cool little song at the end
elephant mosquito turns into "HELLO"
See I knew about the females needing blood to help make babies and Ive said every time I got bit... I did not consent 😭 now we all got babies flying about everywhere 😅
I was just observing peculiar little worms in a bucket of water in the garden last week, not realizing they're mosquito bebes. Consider we have many bees and bumblebees here, I should have just pured the bucket over into the small plastic lotus pond filled with frogs next to it. I even took video.. #killitwithfire
Here we go again   :D
If there are mosquitoes that don’t need a blood meal, seems like we should move those genes to the human biting variety and thus alter them to also not need a blood meal, thereby making mosquitoes as harmless as a lady gaga
a long time ago - i learned to think and understand that presentations like yours are not purposed for intelligent and prudent people . It is only entertainment for juvenile degenerates in age or disposition . If only you took a lesson from one of the nastiest and most vulgar person ever in the media / theater - robin williams  - then you would not stop at the cutesy babbeh talk so that the twisted kids can enjoy your half baked / haft putrefied humor .  You would really let it all hang out and just say all the vulgar nastiness that is in your mind and heart . You are rotten to the core and it shows .  Your greatest desire is to infest your poison into as many young minds as possible - isn't it ? Then why do you troll your rotten chum with slimy surfactants in attempt to smooth out the crunchy smelly chucks of detritus that are in the mix ? Only one reason . You only have a mindset to appeal to the gross vulgar juveniles in age and intellect and you know it works . Before you get old and you realize you have done nothing more with your life than spew nastiness ( like robin williams ) I hope you find out about the grace of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ who can teach you a better joy of being a presenter of virtue rather than superfluity .
The emerging mosquito at the beginning looks less like Lady Gaga and more like The Ring girl.
We stan Toxorhynchities on this channel
wait how can that one larva turn its head around in circles?does the brain just swivel?
man, you narrating over these videos will never get old especially the "That is how a _______ do."
They're lucky they aren't bigger in their larval form or else humans somewhere would be eating it and calling it "river shrimp".
ok youtube you win ill watch it
Now that bebe dead bebe 😂
I live for this channel 🤣🤣 Educational and amusing every single time
better than david Attenborough by this point.
Let's just ignore that elephant mosquito in the room.
Dam. I thought this was a serious video and not someone's audition tape for kids say the funniest things
Why can't this fuckin guy say babies right? Its honestly annoying
Omg! You mean science ISN'T "settled"??? Hmmmm.
I keep wanting to smack my screen to kill the mosquitoes
Ah yes. Mosque-eetos
I still hope they all die…
Somehow, I now have more respect for mosquitoes.
"even people, and people are very good at killing people"
Best 15:27min  (video length not marked time) of my life :D
Fuck mosquitos - they == nightmare fuel
DEMON BABY
Theres still hope for the internet as long as zefrank doesn't leave us for too long
Attempt number one to watch this video was unsuccessful. bbl
Hope you can come out with vids more frequently. Its too funny XD great work ✌️
Youtube has the audacity to not notify me of a new zefrank video...
you forgot about the part where mosquitos were vaccines before vaccines existed
The only animal I don't like and I kill on sight.
This video should be 17 minutes of you saying "F_ck Mosquitos".
Mosquitos are useless, we could make them all extinct and it wouldn't negatively affect any other species. Therefore we should make them all extinct.
Love the video style
The footage in this video is especially fantastic.
Thanks for the trypo warning, after it was already too late. 😂😂
13:37 like those in the genus anopheles pictured here with a match so you can get a sense of how hard it is for them to pick up a smoking habit 😂😂
roomer has it,  half of all people that have died, died from this little Fokker
Ok so if you dont breathe around mosquitos they wont find you. Thankyou I'm gonna stop breathing now Edit* shit i need to watch the whole vid before commenting
HELLO! 😂
The Johnston’s Organ part had me laughing 😂
I love the narration!
Watching this in Rooftop and mosquitoes eating me alive.
If you can make videos on mosquitos can you make a video on Satan himself?
bebeys
First time I’m watching your channel. Love the presentation! Documentary has not been this much fun for me. Absolutely entertaining! Liked and subbed!
I've been waiting for this! I finally meet my nemesis! 😤😤😤
Thank you for so many laughs over so many years zefrank!
The verbal question mark on "roof" was great lol
this vid helped me realise my sense of humor is that of a mouse-cheese-toe
True Fact - Drecksviecher!
Awesome!
Will that song be available on itunes?
DEMON BABY - Zefrank 2021
Mans historical enemy
"Mosquitos all the way down" is the best description of capitalism I've ever heard
Thanks, I hate it
I just learned about things I absolutely hate but in the best way
I came here thinking, "You're not gonna make me like mosquitos!"  And I was right.
The butt joke love it !!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The chihuahua part got me 😂💀
Bro theres this stupid tiny mosquito that's been bothering me all morning to the point i need to cover myself in all my sheets to be in peace. :(
Noone: Zefrank: *bebies*
I just watched a film last night called Mosquito State, it’s absolutely uncanny that I just watched tons of similar footage, spent all night reading about the mosquito only to reference CuriosityStream today texting with a friend, have the thought “I’ve not seen any Ze Frank videos lately” hop over here and WTF?!? It’s bizarre, uncanny and very comforting :)  I have always leaned into evolutionary function when dealing with negativity on earth, what’s the function? Why does this exist? I often held the belief mosquitos had minimal impact from an evolutionary standpoint BEYOND population control (they are the worlds deadliest animal after all) and human migration. Well, then I got into aquaculture and boom, mosquito larvae is a pivotal food source for fish so now I’ve grown to accept them. Oh, and the pollinating, yeah, I guess they’re FINE. Ugh I have made myself live on good terms with flues and ants, I see how valuable they are, but mosquitoes seemed to be contributing nothing but parasitism ergo not contributing a damn thing.  Anyhow, love the video, watching it three times :)
I once watched a mosquito bite me and fill up on blood. It got so big that when it was finished it didn't even fly off, it rolled and fell to the ground lol.
When I look at the larvae, it looks terrified 👁👄👁..
One of the greatest true facts of all times. Disturbing and fascinating.
Thanks I hated the whole thing
Me: "My parents take care of me until college"  Mosquito: throws his little one on the pool
Demon Babys!!!😅
This is actually really interesting.
I never knew I needed this but by evolution I did
Educational and hilarious, the best combination
Hello!
This was very ew but thank you for the education and funnies
i wanted to know it is true you can trap a mosquito with your muscles while she is sucking your blood, i heard she will exploit because  can't stop unless she pull her sting
The bibis kills me everytime 😂
"oop thats not an egg" got me
“…who must have had a tiny organ.”   I was still giggling about that when he went “grow up” and I LOST IT XDDDDDDDDDDD   He knows how our immature little brains work waaaay too well XD
You should do the butterfly next
Thanks for giving us an insight on how Lady Gaga enters the stage 🤣🤣🤣
Can't believe I impregnate Mosquitoes by my DNA.
I saw the mosquitos fly in the video and instinctively slapped my screen 😂
Great job!
**BEBES**
👹DEMON👹BABY👹
only zefrank can make mosquitoes entertaining and I am here for it
When you see a list of citations in the end, you don't feel it's more serious, you feel the channel is genuinely annoyed by some of the recurring comments.
Nothing in this propaganda video will lower my hatred for mosquitos
I can’t fucking stand mosquitos 🤦🏾‍♂️
Its mosquitos all the way down!!!
...connects to the RRROOOOF!
Interesting
Who the H*** is dale and what did he do with Jerry?!!!!.... oh good he's fine.
This guy is BRILLIANT..... makes me laugh every time while teaching me new stuff!!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
Where's Adel to set fire to the rain?
I hate this video. Its sucking me dry.
BRILLIANT!!!!!! This is the 1st video I've watched from your channel and I have to say I was quite impressed. I just subscribed and I am hoping I can expect more of the cheeky tone set in this video. You truly made my day, Thank you !!!!
Never heard of this channel before a minute ago. That intro, 👌. Got yourself a new subscriber based solely on that.
You had me at Hello😂🤣🤣🤣
tsssk those fuckers better be honored to be featured in zee'z videos
Imagine how many mosquitos would exist if there weren't predators of their larvae
HELLLLLLLLLLOOOOO! 🤣
the elephant mosquito out there trying to clear the name of his bretheren while slaying the heretics
I love this channel already 😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
after watching this I know so much about mosquito now
So moskitos likes plant bukakes pretty cool
👿Demon Bebe!!!👿
Butt first.
Funny and educational, and this one has some absolutely fantastic footage, wow!
As familiar as I am with this channel, all I can think of this entire video is Arin getting super defensive when Dan said Mosquitos all need to die, and explaining poorly why they're important to the ecosystem.
Omg, the song at the end!
Mosquitos....I truly hate these uggly bastards. Sucking blood, make you scratch yourself like a maniac and they disturb your peace at all time. When I'm with a griup of people on company, these bastards always goes for me, like my blood is a delicase = a stake before a hotdog. Hate them.
https://youtu.be/l9jacVw1HFo
https://youtu.be/l9jacVw1HFo
Fuck mosquitos, way too many of them in Finland Perkele!
All that just to get smashed when they bite me 🤣
I swear to Goddess you are still the most unique, most interesting, most entertaining, most catered-to-me producer of content on Youtube. Your channel is perfect.
.
16:26 Song replay
bruh my name is del and i am having a conversation with zefrank
I’ve heard that mosquitoes suck out the stuff that turns off your body alarm system once they’re done, so it’s better to let them finish. I don’t care to find out… Also, so does this mean that the bitey ones are attracted by people breathing and there’s always one poor bastard getting eaten when they could pick anyone else near them (since I’m usually the one that gets eaten)? Fuckers.
the shitsquito.
Which ones are genetically engineered by bill gates
1:03 Me: Pour some god damn oil!!
Ive always loved these videos, being able to have a laugh and learn something at the same time is really enjoyable. But i wish i was warned about the trypophobia...... **shudder** its haunting.
Wow amazing
my daughter and i have so much fun learning and laughing with these videos!!!! thank you!!!!!
Thanks for educating me on Mosquitoes   I am a fakemon artist working on a Bug/Dark Mosquito called “Vamsipher” and this’ll help me understand the inspiration better
Informative and I'm also crying with laughter even though I hate these little parasites
:0
The first three minutes is just Spore gameplay.
johnstons organ is very average size for his age
I love this dude
Can't stand these things. Every year when I go to Lake George in early summer, I bring back a few gallons of lake water from near the shore. Dump it in my pond. I wind up with enough dragon flies to eat the mosquitoes for the summer.
I mean…. Who hasn’t lost a child or two at the water park!! 🤣 I’m fahkin dying!!
The return of the king!
Return of the king
Working outside we often find large puddles and places where these larve are. If there aren't any tadpoles we put oil on the surface to work without being bitten
4:41
How could you know I held my breath. This is breath taking
13:31 *Gasps* I’m a father!
Bro the beginning😂.
@3:09 it’s a giant water bug known as the “Toe Biter”, I only know this because I just saw that Coyote guy on YouTube that gets off by getting bit by shit caught one because he said it was 1 of 2 bugs that scared him to death then let it bite him, damn thang drew blood… from his toe. That guy is an idiot
Please watch till the end, it's beautiful
The poles on bumper cars that connect to the roof?
7:53 He pronounced it!!
I lost it at the Chihuahua part
Make sure to read these little snippets at 15:57 and beyond to get an idea of just how much work this man puts in to every video. The scripts and the songs are perfection too! 🤌 Thank you Mr. Ze Frank your work is much appreciated😃
Otherwise known as Moscowito...
"you can try this 😂😂😂" demon baby 😂😂
Narrative is awesome 👊😁
Omg why Natgeo didnt do this video
3:20 - POO PARTY! 💩 🎉
They make for a good food source for my ants
Why am i curious about the life cycle of cockroaches now
i swear nature/animal education videos need to be like this guy's videos where its interesting and funny
You just changed my mind on mosquitos... I love all animals but was like.. Mosquirtos are very fucking annoying.. Now I know theyre also just looking to find someone
Gold every time.
Finally an updateee
That’s amazing… but I’m still killing it if it tries to bite me. I ain’t payin child support lol
i really want a true facts about the fruit fly
Oh my god, why did I watch that.
"HellOooo"
He llloooooo!!!
I missed these
Watching this makes me feel itchy.
That's so interesting. I still want them gone and dead.
Mosquitos make up the majority of Earths biomass for things that eat insects. They literally exist to be food.
I read somewhere that experimentation has begun with releasing sterile mosquitoes into the wild to start reducing their populations.  Hopefully it works so they can move onto ticks next.
Those beh-baes get noxious later
I wonder if anyone else laughed the same time you said grow up.
Holy fuck you bavk again
this is cool. But i still hate them
This was like a TooL video lmfao
It’s legit informative and entertaining at the same time. The Learning & Laughing combo is mint. Bravo
I have a new respect for mosquitos. But I still hate them.
The...beginning..."Learn to think"...thats...literally backwards....socrates said he cant teach people anything...he can only make people think.
0:08 I can just hear Dharkon's theme playing as the Mosquito emerges from the water.
The narrator cracks me up🤣😂🤣
I love this. Educational but also entertaining and funny narration. :)
mosquito bebe
Couldn’t stop listening even when I couldn’t watch
"It's mosquitoes all the way down..."
Im ashamed it took me 2 days to watch this
Not gettin dicked by the skeeter...oh the horror 😆
Oddly enough, that 'fear of holes' warning was very useful for a trypophobe. Thank you, True Facts Man <3
This is absolutely beautiful
Great video, horrible subject. I appreciate the work done here but I will never stop my  ever burning hatred for these creatures. It's a personal tennet, I will not be swayed otherwise. I wish them all death.
Awesome Video
Most of the species of mosquito that target humans are active during *sunset* and *sunrise.* So one way to avoid being swarmed is to not be outside at those times. There are still a few (as in a single digit mumber of species, at least in the US) that are active during the day or during the night, but the worst times by far are sunset and sunrise.  This is important for mosquito abatement since it determines what time of day fogging operations take place, Pesticide fog has to be applied while the mosquitos are in flight so that they will run into the droplets. If you fog at the wrong time, the most members of the target species of mosquito will be landed and resting instead of flying around.
With a surname of Yee, Donald Yee could have any number of great things using his name-Yee Old Watering Hole, Yee Best Bet for [life insurance, car insurance, or actual gambling], Hear Yee Hear Yee a legal educational series kinda like that Radiolab one... but nope, had to be Yee Mosquito Lab. Somehow I don't think that makes him more popular, but it does make people avoid going near his place of infamy... so if he's a bit asocial, skeeters are a good choice for ensuring limited human interaction!
I hate it when I get dicked by a skeeter!
2:13 Man, the new _Spore_ game graphics look amazing. So lifelike! ;-)😉
If I recoll my old Mosquito Abatment training, there are also mosquito larva that live on the roots of plants that grow along the edges of bodies of water. This spot is well protected from typical predators like birds or fish, so jt can be difficult to control populations of these species (since a common abatement practice for water bodies involves introducing fish to eat the larvae). Instead, one tactic to consiser is replacing the host plants with different species that won’t shelter the mosquitos.
That moment the mosquito raises...  *boss theme plays*
Getting real sick of Jerry's shit.
Man I lost it when he said even mosquitos aren’t safe
Thank you, zefrank, you always make my day better :)
"Straining soup through a mustache" just reminded me that it's pizzamas and made me imagine John Green's mustache straining pizza sauce flavored soup through his Pizza John mustache (I mean, really good tomato basil soup is basically just marinara with less oregano)...
Me before video starts: I still want all mosquitos to parish... Me at 6:27: Accept the elephant mosquito, they can stay.
So many things to say about this brilliant True Facts... that 'holes freak you out thing' WASN'T me but might BECOME me thanks to that crazy close up... but any lasting impression of it left when he again gave a way to get arrested for VERY indecent exposure and the excuse right here... "I wanted to see if I could breathe like a mosquito"  I lost it at demon baby. And that was only the first 2 minutes.   I appreciate this only being in 720p. There's only so much terror you should be allowed to shove at people  in 4k or even 1080p definition!!
Im thinking mosquitos just put me in a good mood !  Nireator is Nutts !  UK
DUDE!!   'i' love the way you 'articulate' - - delightful !!!!
Did a misquito made this ?
"Crab hole creeps" 😂
I can take my hatred for mosquitoes to next level! Hail the mind! Hail the blood!
I'm all itchy.
Catchy song haha  X
"Alright. It looks like Snuffleupagus, but reimagined as a dildo. Wearing glasses." Okay, but why is that so bloody accurate?
When David Attenburough retires, you should get his job.
https://youtu.be/l9jacVw1HFo
and now its gettin' dicked by a skeeter is not a sentence i ever thought id hear
Those poles on the bumper cars that connect to the roOF?
My god PLEASE put this song on Spotify
I live for the day there will be a collaboration between ZeFrank and Casual Geographic 🤓
The news that mosquitoes are pollinators destroyed me.
i literally sat here watching this while getting attacked by a mosquito in the dark so now i am itchy and informed
Greatly appreciate the trypophobia trigger warning ⚠️
I seen them in a rain barrel i threw fire crackers in there didnt realize they were mosquitos but now i know i did a good thing
"There are mosquito bebes out there that were made from bits of you!"
man them flies are pedophiles
it brings me joy knowing there is a Mosquito for Mosquitos
still hate Mosquito
"it's mosquitos all the way down!" brilliant double reference!
I have newfound respect for mosquitos. I didn't think that would've ever been possible.
Fact: I still don't like mosquitoes
12:05 had me dying lmfaoooo
1.1m views in two days, insane. Mosquitoes are truly terrifying.
if only all teachers in the world teaches about things like this, atleast will reduce students sleeping in the class
0:48 anyone else think of popcorn when watching that? (obviously not to eat lmao just the way they popped out😭😭)
b.a.c.k. .k..c. .a. b. like wtf ...  did it always do that.... i don't like that.... english freaks me out.... #Youtube #Foxnews
Now i know how ridley scott came up with “Alien”
… I mean.. “hellooooo!”
As someone who absolutely despises mosquitoes, watching this was the equivalent to watching the life story of my worst enemy.
I still think we should kill all the blood suckers
While I appreciate the Trypophobia warning in the beginning, perhaps next time consider giving it *before* the footage you're giving a warning for rofl
Classy as always :D.
This video made me itchy...
This was actually good and it put me to sleep 😴 thx 😌
bruh that outro cought me off guard
I need to unlearn this espisode
2:56 "Now that behbeh dead behbeh."
“Demon baby” 👹
Loved it 💯
.. that connect to the rroooff
Dragonflys are wonderful. They're doing you a favor eating pests even when they're babies
A snuffalufagus dildo. What the fck?
Pretty sure I actually woke my neighbor with my sudden outburst of laughter at the “Hello!” Mosquito. Dunno why that shit was so funny to me.
A flying needle
I *deeply regret* eating before watching this xD
😪
I'm beyond impressed.
I'm a little lost, or I've been out of the loop, who is Dale? And whERE IS JERRY??
I miss Morgan Freeman voice x-x
I almost hate them more after watching this but thanks for making it entertaining 🙃
This left me feeling dirty
I hate these bugs!!!
I'm high AF and this video has me laughing so hard.  The way he says baby 🤣🤣 i also had to cover the screen 4 the beginning...sh*t would've made me sick
Yassss. Been watching you for years. And still fun to keep coming back.
Omg I'm a mother
The only mosquito I like is the ones that don't bite me.
The elephant mosquitos "hell-low!" had me rolling 😂
Youre the funniest, best animal explainer ever.
Remember that Pleakly thought he was saving these guys from extinction
Poo-pah-tæ
Im so mad you only made videos like every other month! MORE MORE MORE!
Can’t stop laughing!!!!  Only if Nat Geo was done like this!  😂😂
Anyone else itchy?
Plssss get this man to 4m
Before you get arrested 😆
Trypophobia yes
Missed opportunity to say "that's how brilliant do"
There good for animal food lol lol
That Intro is priceless 😂     Fck it! this channel it self is priceless
My Tryphophobia😭😭😭😭
Fantastic
First time watching one of your videos. Gave me severe anxiety.
I need this
So skeeters have smaller skeeters 🦟  that bite them after they just got done biting something else….I’m not surprised. Considering it’s the most disrespectful insect in the entire kingdom
So before the video I paused it to make food. Was 3 bites deep before he said I should goto the kitchen and get something to eat.
Absolutely fascinating watching insects close up. Brilliant visuals and the best narrated delivery on YouTube. Thanks so much for sharing.    ;)
I actually did not know frogs peed like that
Others: Babies The heavy guy: BAEBI Zefrank1: behbies~
DEMON BABY! 2:06
The mosquito song at the end 🎶
Why hasn’t NatGeo or Animal Planet given ZeFrank an after hours show
So basically, mosquitoes are just a F@Q NO from the get go?  I guess I like the elephant mosquito... And ONLY the elephant mosquito 😒
0:57 the forbidden corn on the cob
Fun fact: they all deserve extinction
That's seriously amazing and interesting.... and as always... Funny as hell... I seen your Ted Talk.  I think it was Ted.  Your story is really interesting as well Sir .. how you found internet fame.   Good stuff
aww fuck zefrank1 Lemme get that dope song at the end. It's actually really smooth and nice n creepy for the October season, thank god I don't get  bit by much mosquitos... usually....
Only getting better😍
Hello... 😹😹😹
I respect mosquitoes now lol idk why...
Dicked by a skeeter!
8:50 hahaha Lmao XD
"The Elephant Mosquito" Sounds intimidating.  :/
I am so disgusted. This is more than enough for this year's share of horror movies. Nature never disappoints.
🤘
What's a "bebi"?
man the sponsorship ad is so encouraging
When he told me to grow up I felt that
BEBES
Dammit I'm eating
I think this might be the longest "True Facts" video I've seen so far, and I've seen a _lot_ of them.  And yet, somehow, it's all meat, no scrap. Or if you don't eat meat, it's all good-food, no scrap.  zefrank1 is the Chef John of figuratively roasting animals. Others may come, but there's only one original.
OOC I just want to say that the thumbnail looks really like the logo of Dota 2 TI10 that's why I'm here
Nice photography, many good facts...insipid dialog. No need to be vulgar.
*"This video is sponsored by BRILLIANT, learn to think."*  Oh okay.
You should do true facts about barnacle
I would love it if you & Coyote Peterson did a video together 😏
Well isn't that footage just enough to make a person too intimidated to suggest their own might be useful for one of these. There was some really stunning stuff in there.
I hate them for what they do to my body, but this makes them a little more interesting. Thank you for spreading knowledge about the beauty of even the most annoying of creatures.
Thank you for your video
I didn't know mosquitos were so freakin' funny!  That was great!
Behbehs
Moral of the Day: eradicate all other Mosquitoes except the Elephant Mosquitoes.
Bloodsuckers!! Not very Octoberish, but very Vanpiric :-D
Because of the density air competitively, mosquitoes swim through the air, rather than flying through it.
Bitey little bastards
Great video. I'm a mosquito magnet. There's a lot of them on the property. I got bitten so many times. Spiders like to bite me too
We love our Hummingbyrd! And our Larry , the squirrel... love to watch how Hummers and Squirrels Do!
He's b a c c
Thanks for the Tryptophobia warning, AFTER not before, you should have given it.
I hate them all
Mosquito behbezs dead behbezs
Learned some are pollinators, I could honestly let some flowers go bye bye to get rid of mosquitoes since stepping outside at night where I live is a death sentence
"Getting dicked by a skeeter' 😂
" There. Now that baby dead baby. "
Mosquitoes (and midges) are fascinating creatures and can actually be fun to work with.
The “butt first, sorry, butt first” joke gets funnier every time
Have loved your videos for years.
Butt, first… 😬
Trust me come to Florida, you’ll want to commit a mosquito genocide
Great video!  also your humor is fantastic!
Make them all die
Lmfao I’m never saying does a bear shit in the woods again I’m gonna use is a baby mosquitos ass hole water tight
I still want to know why mosquitoes seem to love my blood over everyone around me’s.
Another good reason to wear a mask? Less CO2 for skeeters to find us by?
"People are very good at killing people"  TRUTH
Lmao try breathing thru your ass… I laughed so hard. Thank you so much for this. I just love you videos.
this narration is SO good
You misspelled *Bastard Flies*
I didn't know you were still making these
what the hell is this...
I hope this series never stops
Asking chickens what humans are good for puts things in an interesting perspective
God I hate them but oh so fascinating
Would it be a problem if we killed off mosquitos that fed on humans, even just the 5% with parasites
I've been bit by mosquitoes so much I think their "Saliva alarm suppressor" no longer works on me- I can usually tell as soon as they start biting because my skin immediately starts to itch there. But if I don't bother the bite, the bite can stop itching in a couple hours.
I should be doing my exam, but *Mosquitos*
**There are mosquito babies out there that were made from bits of you** I was not ready for this line.
Am I convinced that the world wouldn't be better off without mosquitos? Well, no.  But am I more informed about why?  Yes.
This is the best thing that youtube has ever recommended me <3
I used to hate all mosquito's, after watching this there's a few I'm ok with. Thanks Zefrank.
Just. Incredible. ..
One must understand their enemies's motives before overcoming their foe.  I hate mosquitoes.
3:01 “oh look at that! they eat you butt first too” 😭
burn them with fire!
If you skip forward 10 seconds at just the right time when he starts introducing the sponsorship, you can hear him say “Brilliant is a problem-solving bitch.”
Wow interesting 🤔 Goes outside and kills them anyways 🤪
I love this freakin channel!
foul language and sexual comments throughout.  did you used to make porn movies?
whyd i watch this as i was eating… i didnt stop, but i feel like these chips would taste better without watching them lay eggs..
16:25
so what im hearing is that we need more dragonfly's and elephant mosquitos?
I watched Lucy last night and thought of you. Glad you are still here.
So would exactly would be the detriment if we committed genocide to the mosquito species that preyed on human blood?
No we can live without these pests. Id live a happy life without them
Lmfao! I lost it at "Hellooo" 😆 great stuff.
I was watching this video, paused it while i was at lunch, went to the bathroom, finished my business, then i was viciously attacked by a malevolent  mosquito. I think it was watching the video for pointers...
fact 1; one day i will kill them all
I thought this was going to be a serious video, but I was wrong. Not mad tho it was hilarious!
I can't believe I just watched all of that....I'm gonna probably binge everything on this channel now 😅😅 10/10 for humor and facts lol.
I feel like Jerry can just never catch a break in any of these
Mosquito was my nickname when I was a child 😅
Butt first. But, first..... Punctuation is important lol
First time I watch you bro and it's very awesome!!!
Still dont want them to exist. They had a good run but kill em all
This actually made me appreciate mosquitos a little more!
2:11 Demen Behbeh! 😄😄😄
Do a spadefoot toad video please !! I've seen some amazing video footage of them twerking and I know you could make a music video with that.....oh and also they're freaking zombies 😳
This is interesting but I hate knowing it
This is hilarious but now I'm all itchy so thanks for that...
So I have biological mosquito babies?
What do you do for a living? Also you have a wonderful voice, keep up the good work 👍
A sad ghost got me. He isn't wrong.
Fuck bugs
F**k Mosquitos.   Nice video though. Liked.
that was a toe bitter
Interesting  And hilarious  But kill them all!!!
Know your enemy, the video
Did you know that Alaskan tiger mosquitos really go for you if you eat a banana first?
Damn it!! I just snorted hot coffee out my nose at work! That getting dick from a skeeter part!
Insect world is some next level horror film
Who the fuck is Dale? Does Jerry know?!
Very.very imfomative!
This was informative, scary and gross at the same time. Sub.
I recognize that voice... Is this the crack spider guy?
0:41 IT HURTS!! IT HURTS!!!
Aside from the non-blood sucking mosquitoes, I'm still in favor of all mosquitoes just disappearing forever.
I’ve had to deal with mosquitoes my entire life! From San Antonio, Iraq, Louisiana, Houston, Belize and Grand Cayman! Grand Cayman was the only one that got it right by genetically modifying their INVASIVE male mosquitoes to produce unproductive larva decreasing their INVASIVE mosquito population by 82% in two years.   Houston has a shit ton of INVASIVE mosquitoes that need to go away! 🙈   Glad I saw this! It was informative, interesting and funny! 😘✌🏼
"And now it's getting dicked by a skeeter" is the funniest thing anyone has ever said.
The mosquito that likes reptiles and amphibians is called Culex territans. I have always liked them
Dale!? Where's Pete?
came here to say: don't you dare put "beautiful" and "mosquito" in the same sentence ever again.
Wow! This one had so much info packed into it! Thank you to all the researchers who filmed and study sketers!
The funny thing is that I was bit by one not too long ago and I didn't even notice
the way he says bae baes
I'm kinda disappointed there were no tips for defense against them or how to kill them successfully
4:40 I did the same thing when I was born.
Elephant Mosquitoes are the best type of mosquito, it eats the smaller more dangerous types of mosquitoes and it doesn’t bite as an adult plus it still pollinates flowers, it just goes to show any animal can be good even the ones people despise the most
AHAHAHAHA SO ITS TRUE the king has returned.
I think you’ll appreciate the fact that I work in pest control and everytime A customer asks me about a specific bug, I refer them to one of your videos if it’s relevant. So far, Ant mutualism is the most common lol.
DEVIL! DEMON!! SPAWN OF SATAN!!! KILL IT KILL IT KILLLLLLLL IIIIIIIIIIIIITTT!!!!!!! (Oh and I'm pretty sure the thing eating the larva at 3:06 is a Water Scorpion which you should definitely do a video on! Love ya frank)
“Butt first, sorry, BUT first….”
From Minnesota (state bird's the mosquito). Interesting info & visuals, but The Narrator's cutesy delivery's unbearably irritating -- much like a cloud of his subject matter.
That terrifying thing he didn't want to google is (I'm pretty sure) a toe biter, and yes they are terrifying.
I have been waiting years for this thank you I legitimately love mosquitoes they are the most interesting flies of all time only above robber flies
Me watching a video about mosquito's while my feet are being attacked by a mosquito, Interesting
If this isn't 17 straight minutes of teaching us how to eradicate mosquitoes from our daily lives I will  have been betrayed.
The morgan freeman voice is alittle much
Bebeeehsss<3 😂
Mosquitos find people the way I find Mary Jane at a music festival.
Watching so that I can know my enemy better
I’m so sad I haven’t seen this channel sooner! This was hilarious!
still itchy...
Don’t you hate when you get dicked by a skeeter? 🤣
SO GOOOOOOOD!!!!! 🌟 💖 THANK YOU ZE FRANK AND TEAM! YOU ALL ARE THE VERY BEST!!!!!!!
Still the funniest entertaining yet educational channel
You can’t tell me to grow up when you make the jokes, sir. 🤣🤣
I would pay to have the "Hellooo! " and "Demon baby!"  as txt alerts
As interesting as this is, it makes my skin crawl
Jackknife under water. That is bold
Don't want that mixed in with my porn😮😳 don't want anyone to get the Wrong idea.🤔
Finally another one please keep it up man
This is by far the best educational video I've ever watched  Great job!!
Know thy enemy before you engage it.
didn't you used to sound like morgan freeman when you do these things?
True facts has taught me that Toxorynchites is a chad mosquito
5:39 Glass: am I a joke to u?
learned the most laughed the most
I'm on my seventh molt.
From what I saw, the mosquito is a very bad phlebotomist.
Though I learned nothing new, I love how you make the facts 'fun', and I still watched the entire thing due to that. HELLOOO!
15:11  A+ post work, Jerry
Burn all mosquitoes to a crisp!
Fascinating live cycle until someone or something punches that one fucker on the wall so hard the neighbors dog gets scared and they call to cops on a welfare check and someone or something has to explain the broken finger to them and a hole in their bedroom wall ahh nature beautiful and violent
Can you make a video on rodents like hamsters and capybaras?
Always a good day when I get this notification.
I fuckin love this channel. Informational but goddamn funny as hell
First time I've watched one of your videos. The wise cracks had me rolling the whole time! I paused the video 1/3 way in to subscribe. Well done!
3:10 I believe that's a Water Scorpion.
What happened to jerry
Les maringouins
Will this make me like the evil blood suckers? (Answer after I watch it.)
Can confirm that playing this video out loud does attract mosquitoes.
Please do secretary birds in the future i get the feeling that your humarous way off educating would make for so quality content.
I was really hesitant to click on this because I have never had a problem with mosquitos biting me until the last few years and I am apparently sensitive to their stupid saliva and the bump swells up and I freak out wtf bit me !!!!!
Love this and I not only dislike instead of hate mosquitoes! ✌️❤️😂
They clean the water. I learned a lot, but it’s so puerile. Do you think this is what you need to do to reach children? I don’t understand. There is a lot of useful information here. Don’t sell yourself short.
That blood vessel close up was actually terrifying...  what in the actual fuuuuuu c k ! ?
Why the fuck wasn't I reccomended this earlier
Funny and interesting as always
Thank you for another awesome super funny video that actually teaches me a ton.
Braved the mosquito footage which I knew was going to make me fidget so I could hear the jokes.
Algorithm comment
Bebes
Can we just appreciate the outstanding photography? I mean really, the fact that we are able to see such high definition footage.
I think this is the first True Facts that's made me want to actually vomit. And there are a lot grosser ones out there...Just something about mosquitos.
@2:34 - strangulation or butt biting?
i NEED a full version of the mosquito song. if i dont get it im considering it a hate crime
Existence paid as much attention creating you as it did creating the the smallest. There is no hierarchy.
Who the heck are these people that just sit there and get bit so that someone can film it?? Ewww
"The female mosquito needs some of that male mosquito sperm. But first, a word from our sponsor."
Great video. I feel like the woodpecker would be a good topic for a future video. Their tongues wrap around their brains as a shock absorber.
Who else has watched these since freshmen biology class in 2011? 🙋‍♂️👀
Demon Baby...🤣
I look forward to every one of these!
to beat my enemy I must first understand my enemy
3:07 is a Giant Water Beetle. They have a hell of a bite
love swatting these aedis aegypti bastards when they're full of blood.
These are just getting better and better. They used to just be silly, then there were some that were educational, but significantly less silly. This is the masterpiece with a wonderful mix of silly and educational. The end song is definitely one of the best too!
So everyone is a father of all mosquitos.
Even after watching this, I still hate Mosquitos.
God Dam, I love your content ! Why is it always so Good...
So what you're saying is I should get a flamethrower?
Gorb...
Thank you for keeping em' coming!  I always laugh when watching what you make!
The Mosquito. The Deadliest Creature on the Planet.
If Zefrank1 started a cult, I'd check it out.
When I thought what if I held my breath, he said right then try and hold your breath and they will still find you🤯🤯🤯
Misqito Why?
I love these videos so damn much, always so funny while still educational!   Also, cannot get the outro out of my head now, thanks.
Imagine now coming out into the world as a mosquito...and boom you dead!!...as you emerge...🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Had to sub cos of the bebe's 😂
That's a frog peeing on another frog. I. Am. Dead.
Moscow-e-toes  Seems accurate
well this was wonderful and horrible at the same time
This video itches
I absolute hate mosquitoes but it was funny and i appreciate you going after all that info, i had no idea they eat sugar and that theres one that feeds on others, loved it
3:07 wait this looks sick what is it called actually?
My legs are currently swollen from mosquito bites. Thankfully none of them triggered my allergy to their bites....maybe it's species specific 🤔
DWE 😂
why is my skin so itchy now??
After years of watching youtube I've been under the impression that I known English well enough, until I see this one, which is not optimized to attract as much audience as possible from non-native English speakers.
heLLO!
''Look at that they eat butt 1st.''
My trypophobia senses were tingling before he even said that disclaimer about people with fear of holes... 0:27
I can't stand how creepy your latest videos have been but I'm letting this play for the view and hitting the like... BUT IM NOT WATCHING! SCREW YOU!
screw mosquitos, they can burn along with ticks
I like your wise facts funnyman. 🤣
I always considered misquotes robots that just layed the eggs and left them alone, but these mothers seemed to really care about their children, so strange.
When you actually want Morgan Freeman to narrate.
HE'S BACKKKKK
I worked with Aedes aegypti (and some Aedes albopictus) for my masters and my current job and was just telling a friend about the experience. This video couldn't have come out at a better time! Gotta send this to her now :P
3:09 I think that thing you were afraid to look up is called a “Toe-biter” were I am from. Made me never want stick my feet in the water, but on the upside your search history is safe. They are also called giant water bugs and they are in the family Belostomatidae. Apparently some can fly. The largest species can feed on baby turtles and snakes. Their bite is described as excruciatingly painful, sometimes they play dead and then bite if the threat doesn’t leave them alone. And I guess some places in the world people eat them.
This made my day! And I really had a good day already. That's how good True Facts be.
mosquitoes exist mosquito magnet be like the Doom Slayer
thumbs up for demon baby @2:10
There's no other animal I hate more than mosquitoes
I hate this so much.
I fugen love the way you describe things
Gross but fascinating.
It should be called a “Snorkel” and not a “Siphon”
Thank you for the tryptophobia warning
Dayum! That big ass Giant Water Bug sucking on a mosquito larva.
I needed you to have been my science, English, history, well, everything teacher when I was in grade school
wow i always thought all of these guys bit humans and never would of guessed they were pollinators!
Now that behbeh ded behbeh
Lost count of how many times I laughed through this True Facts  "Jerry fix it in post would you? Females in the genus Trsdzfysdfskdjn..."
I caught this one annoying ass mosquito in a lil seethru container and basically I'm torturing it, I wanted to see what they're iq is, and I stumbled upon this video
I ain’t paying for mosquito support.
Plant sperm NICE!!! 😆👍
This entire time I was just saying  'kill it'
I wonder if any science teachers here show zefrank1's vids in class hehehe.
Good Video. I Kill Every Mosquito I See But This Is Still Interesting & What A Great Narrator! So Many YouTube Videos Have Computer Voice Narration Or Crappy Narrators.
Elephant Mosquito is the real MVP
We need to wipe the all out, they won't affect the food chain much. All they do is cause damage, pain and suffering.
This is good commentary
Alright this guy's is funny
I will subscribe but first. But first! ... i'll like this video.
Oh yeah, kill them all, I don’t care
Fun fact: mosquitoes don't deserve to exist
Moose blood guy!
Could you do Gnats next? They keep bothering my house... and me to a greater extent.
I didn’t know some mosquitos eat pollen who knew 🤷🏾‍♂️
What are mosquitoes good for?  They are the guardians of the forest, tiny knights who defend nature  from the invading human hordes who come and destroy the land.
Elephant mosquito gang
I will never get tired of these videos. Seriously.
Anyone else get all kindsa itchy watchin this?!?
As being someone who apparently has a huge phobia with Mosquitos? I managed to get through this without any problems. And that's why I love your videos so much.  Also, had no idea there's a mosquito that eats other mosquitos, pollenates and doesn't bite, that's amazing.
DEMON BEHEBH
10/10 quality content
i love this dude.. funny funny man.
I wouldn’t mind them if they just took some blood, I’ve actually got plenty of that! But why do they have to make me itch so bad? The free meal isn’t enough for you? You’ve also gotta poison me? That’s just bad manners.
BaBy!
Props to all the humans that sacrificed themselves to get bitten for the footages in this video
Crab hole creep.   My new favorite insult.
*demon baby* 😂😂
Very interesting, still hate them
This is amazing and super funny!!! Thank you for making the video🤩
So, if a mosquito bites me and makes babbies, does that kinda make me a papa?
Yes I have tryptophobia, and I saw the eggs and it immediately queued my disgust and dislike.  People around me asked if I was okay because of the visceral reaction.  Fucking Mosquitos are terrible enough, but they're gross like incubation and birth pods... ick! Wipe 'Em out!! (except the males and the elephant / mosquito eaters)
I want to know about the blobfish. I have heard so much about it in relation to Steve Bannon and other sad fish facts, so now I want to know the true facts about the blobfish and it's sad, sad demeanor.
Thank u so so much.
Incredible video. Thank you
Aka, the enemy of my life time.
...grow up..., I nearly spit out my coffee.
One of the best ones yet! Thanks for another!
1:45 I mean, the fact that he's implying you'd get arrested before you drown makes you think it's gotta work to some capacity at least 😂
There is one type of good mosquito  Elephant mosquitos are the real mvps.
very informative, but screw mosquitos, all the same
"a dildo wearing glasses" Bro...
Elephant mosquito for the win! Kill the rest with fire lol
Oooooh, so that's what this weird worms are. :D
Oh how I've missed these descriptive videos
This video makes me itch…
Bebies 😂
Do one about vultures! After the excellent one about bats, vultures need some love too.
Also known as the Biden Pipe
interesting and horrible burn with fire !
I have the ability to detect a mosquitoe before it lands on me and if one does land on me the mosquitoe has signed its fate no mosquitoe has flew away with my blood ever lol
It's like watching a briefing about the enemy before going to war. DEATH TO THE MOSQUITOES!
Just plain splendid. Don’t ever stop!
Jerry is right! This proves to me that mosquitos have ZERO purpose other than making us miserable and itchy
This channel is one of those tings you don't know how you found  out about, but glad you did.
I love this narrator.
4:41 you had a blast saying that lmao
Die mosquitos!! Diiiiieeee!!!! 🦟💀
8:24 Classic Jerry.
So.... how do we kill them all ? did I miss that part ?
you could play the undertaker Theme to him rising like that XD and just give him the Hat to lol
Pure. Gold.  I've never thought I'd be laughing so hard at the mosquito facts!
This channel. Insta sub 😆
Mosquitos are good becuse they  are food for a lot of other animals. Tics on the other hand isn't good for anything but carrying diseases. Please make the extinct.
2:11 “ *DEMON* *BABY* ” lmao 😂😂😂
A lot of animals have rough childhoods. The difference here is that with mosquitoes, I'm GLAD they have it rough. You go, other insects. Kill as many of those nasty suckers (hah) as possible.
Bebbes !
Holy shit! Watch until the last second
Only good squito is a Dead one or elephant.
I think the weird bug that Frank doesn't want to be mixed with his porn is a Giant Water Bug. Just if you're curious
Once again a genius post.  You always deliver! Thank you : )
Now THATS a entrance
Zefrank I have learned more about our planet from you than any school or teacher has ever taught me! Thank you for you videos. They are great and you're hysterical!
4:40 HAHAAHHA
Bebbies.
Lmfao demon bebe
Nice to know how these fuckers work
Soup through a musstaoussche
They kick there mates
Lmao
Sigh, time to binge all of zfrank again. I had stuff to do but priorities and what not.   Beeuurds, oseean, hidy hole- Zfrank
ZEFRANK IS BACK WOOHOO
Do you think if Mosquitoes were required to get a license to fly, it would cut down on them buzzing about?
HUMBOLDT SQUID
I'm a simple man, I see a new video from Ze Frank, I click.
the mosquitos that go for feet are actually kinda smart, but then there's mosquitos that don't give a single fuck and will bite you right in your field of view, like the audacity of these motherfuckers
I learned more by animals on this channel than I actually did in School
Mosquitos who don't feed on blood or just on other bloodsuckers are the real MVPs.
Okay… WHAT THE F—!!!!
I always wondered how rice was made
Holy what, I'm seeing a zefrank video on my feed?!
So great video of mosquito🌸 Thanks for beautiful sharing! 🌹🌞
So glad this series has continued. Personally, I prefer the "Here, we will explore true facts about the..." intro over the "Let's back up a bit." intro.   That said, love the series, looking forward to the next one :-)
Anyone else kill a mosquito while watching this video?
trippophobia warning
Very few YT videos can make me laugh as hard as ZeMasterFrank. Hilarity _and_ knowledge. Absolute legend.
His first episode should definitely be sold as an NFT. Great video on mosqueweetos.
Lots of American toilet humor.
Easily the best one ever.  I laughed out loud numerous times.  Well done.
Finally a new episode
Eh, I'm still down with wiping literally all of these from existence. Interesting though
Don’t tell me to grow up lmao, I laughed because your voice cracked! 😂😆
I love your videos but you will never be able to beat your backwards walking Hippo video
I freaking love Zefrank. Always makes my day. 😆
Who are the losers clicking dislike?
Proof WE are an alien world, probably in a galactic zoo of weirdness.
Mosquito says he-llo!
i love how he say "bebes"
Even though this is interesting and all i still hate these little bastards
"They kill more people than any other animal.  Including People who are very good at killing people"
I always have to stop myself from watching these right away. Delayed gratification is the best gratification
True fact nr.1: kill them True fact nr.2: kill them True fact nr.3: kill them Any other facts I should put in?
I honestly hope this continues for years to come, they are funny and actually somewhat informative
I can't believe there's a breed of mosquito that actually deserves to remain living in my presence. The outro is groovy btw 😂👌🏾
Trypophobia!!
Ya know, if it wasn't for two facts, I could actually get behind mosquitoes. The first fact is the diseases they spread. Mosquitoes kill more people, per year, than anything else. Xenomorphs don't even come close. The second fact is the blood sucking bitches. Evolution, you are failing us. This is not the way to do things.
Jerry's a dock😕
when the extra terrestrials show up to end the human experiment and raze our unworthy civilization to the ground, we will show them the collective works of Ze Frank. It is off the strength of his content that we as a species will be spared extinction.
Pedofileses, the one larva porking mosquitoes are pedos 😟
Your sense of humor absolutely slays me. Keep going strong. 🇨🇦🐘🍁🤗
If you spot a mosquito sucking your blood, you can sorta stretch the skin around it's suckysucky thing, which makes it stuck and they can't stop pumping blood, so it ends in a little bloodsplosion
This is why I muscle memorized to brush off a mosquito opposed to slap it as most do. It's not like we live in the days of Malaria, let those little guys charge up on ya. When you donate blood it could be going to a serial killer, but mosquitos can't be serial killers unless they get aids.
The most evil creature on the planet
"it's mosquitoes all the way down"...so it's the inception of straws out here??! Ok👍
this is so upsetting lol
🍩 can I have donut?
I remember reading or hearing from somewhere where we could cause all mosquitoes to die off into extinction we just don’t do it because scientists can’t be sure how much damage it could cause to the planet and it’s inhabitants by killing them all off. I don’t know how true this is please feel free to provide evidence if you know what I’m talking about or if I’m wrong I’d appreciate it.
ah yes the littleae shiticus
Annoying bastards they always get us all (the blood sucker ones)
god the teddy bear and chihuahua comment made me say EW out loud. zefrank you nasty haha
damn it Jerry!
I'd have done much better in science if I'd had Mr Frank instead of that bun having, glasses wearing, knee hi's rolled down old troll that I had.
I wonder if we will ever see Jerry?
😁🤣😁👍
Once again something that breathes through it's butt at one point in its life.
ZeFrank you can't lure us in with an original song then not have a Spotify account.  I need this mosquito bop
I would sooner listen to this voice than David Attenborough's any day.
Hell-OOOOOOO!!!
I do have that thing..
In addition to the usual great information and humor, the photography in this was amazing.
Imagine mosquitoes are the size of german shephards, we would be dead long ago. Be glad people.
The most deadly animal on the planet.
If any of my college professors were as charismatic as the guy, I'd have a triple doctorate by now!  The way he says " baby's" is funny as he'll too
It's mosquitoes all the way down??? And all this time I was thinking turtles 🤦‍♀️ Yikes.
Thank you for this! Very educational, and hysterically funny! I had no Idea mosquitoes were such important pollinators!  I live in Upstate NY and "some" mosquitoes in our area can transmit EEE and West Nile viruses. Until now, I never realized how important to our ecosystem they were!  Thank you for educating me on the subject!
National Geographic needs to hire this guy 😂😂
True facts: about the most hated insect in the entire universe.
I think the larva coming out of the water all T2 like was creepy.  Never knew that they pollinate!  Still prefer bees for that though.
watching zefrank true facts video while eating instant chicken noodles feels like your doing fancy things
The "butt first" joke might be my favorite long running gag
should do one about bed bugs.
Best channel ever 😂
1:48 seconds in and I'm in tears
So I'm already a father huh?
"DEMON bebe" lmao!
"a sad ghost who said boob instead of boo"
8:50 so its like a stalker waiting fir a girl to turn 18 before trying to bed them
I thought my favorite would be the one that eats other mosquitoes and doesn't bite humans, but then it turns out there's a species that's into feet. Kindred spirits, I say. Insects of culture.
Sir David  could get jealous, very good DOCO...!!
Who the HELL is Dale and where is Jerry?
I thought the video was gonna have a custom captions
please keep bringing us more!!!
👍👍👍👍👍👍😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 funtime again.. and such wording too... love the "instant" moment of Life....
Mr. Zefrank how do we kill all of the mosquitos.
WAAAAAYYY more than I ever wanted to know about SKEETERS......
YAAAAAAAAS, NEW VIDEO! :D
Screw getting things accomplished! There's a NEW True Facts about MOSQUITOS❣️ "Mosquito says hello" is even better than "Koalas in the Rain", which is a classic!
Wow, baby mosquitoes literally do blow it out their asses!!!
"it's mosquitos all the way down"
I appreciate the trypophobia trigger warning
I liked the 'HELLO.!!' parts.!
Just discovered this channel, I'm staying for the narration.
What am I watching, best audio ever!
The best biology class
Otherwise known as Moscowheatos
Another awesome episode!!!
True facts: Mosquitos suck.
0:47 "and here come the beh-bies"
This footage is incredible!!
mosquito song totally slaps
This is gold❤️
“…before you get arrested.” 🤣
Do beeees
The look of horror and disgust is still on my face one minute after the video ended.
Cant trick me with this mosquito propaganda. Im gonna breed a race of superfrogs to wipe this threat from the planet.
I can not overstate how much I love these videos and that you use real and thorough research for them. I imagine a ton of work goes into getting permission to use those images and videos, especially unpublished stuff straight from the lab! You are bringing science to everyday people in a way we can all learn from and enjoy and I can't thank you enough!
Another hilarious and informative video!
I absolutely love your videos.
I absolutely love your videos.
Zefrank. I actually got to see bees doing the horizontal mambo. Lots of frantic buzzing. Lol
You know, I went into this with the thought of "fuck mosquitoes the world would be better without them." They're really interesting, unsurprisingly. Most insects are actually cool as hell. They also pollinate, which is awesome. Conclusion: fuck mosquitoes the world would be better without them.
Dildo with shades🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was laughing when he said "grow up" lol
It's mosquitoes all the way down! haha
Well you've done one scourge of humanity. Time to do the other. The german roach. Now that is one insect I would happily wipe off the face the earth and IDGAF what happens after.
I feel like his voice can be legally classified as ASMR.
They should not emerge from pupae like that. Now It's hard to 100% hate the human blood sucking mosquitos :(
I hate them more now
This is hilarious 😂
Wow,  I still wanna kill em all though.
Depressed ghost 👻 🤣🤣🤣
https://youtu.be/EOPEpAytlAk freestyle
So, don't hate on the skeeter. Their upbringing was parentless, subject to being eaten, and could have been as a demon bebe or a ghost suffering from depression.  #BeKind
You deserve a discovery channel TV series my guy. I've been laughing since sad cat diary.
Holy sheet, I needed this. Thank you, Zefrank1. Thank you.
Loved this presentation!!  Well done!😂
L.,
Hey! Thanks for fixing your website a bit... I really miss it all the time. I'm wondering if there's a fix for the JavaScript that's on there? I really really really miss the how to dance tutorial and the cool project we all did together where we took pictures with letters and you can type a word with everyone's pictures :)
For anyone wondering, that bug zefrank doesn’t want in his search history is a water bug, or toe biter
Would really like to see a video of "no-see-ums."  Florida beach goers and fishermen know these devils.  Im pretty sure they're satans offspring
love you Ze!
My trypophobia is triggered and i can't close thr video 🥺
9:47 🐸
Another wonderful trip to crazytown that actually makes skeeters interesting! !
You have once again, proven to be literally one of the most awesome people on this platform!! Love ❤️ every single thing you create Sir!! Wonderfully done, with a little humor and a bit of a PhD sprinkled in!! What else is there??
“If you’re one of those people who doesn’t t like lots of little holes you may want to go to the kitchen for this part” immediately noped out, id like to sleep tonight lol. Thanks for the warning
Love you.
Saitama: Mosquitoes.. suck
Beautiful?
This was the hardest episode for me to watch. I've also decided we need more elephant mosquitos to handle all the bad ones
The pool bit killed me... :'D
I like that elephant mozzie
Even God hates mosquitoes.
Is there any way to unsee this?
Didn't know mosquitoes were pollinators. Still want them all dead.
I bet one has already landed on one of my legs as I was watching this video
love the narration during the video had me laughing a few times
This  channel is amazing. Great narrator, humor, informative, humor...Its the best.
I hate mosquitoes they are the enemy and need to be extinct
Just came from a TedEd video also sponsored by Brilliant. Zefrank's bit is better.
DEMON BEBE
Jerry I laid an egg!
These series are undoubtedly the best thing on the internet! Well, maybe cat videos are better… Aaand maybe videos of little human bebbehs interacting with cats… Aaand some people may add porn (not… me… maybe?), may be even porn with cats (definitely not me! at all in any case!). But after this list of things that are better, these series are the best! I just find it very unjust that Jerry is not credited ever. I mean, sure, he is not the best script writer or fact checker, and his questions are mostly illogical and plain stupid (no offence, Jerry), but these are his own stupid questions and he deserves the credit!
The rooOOF
you're awesome
THIS MAN IS EVERYTHING😍
screw the mosquito. i got bitten 5 time in the last 2 day.
Wow! Such a good video with so much effort put into it! The song at the end was also great!
I love the first few seconds of this video oh my god 😂😂😂😂👌
So what you're saying is.. I should be paying child support for all my mosquito babies?
These insects either drink nectar, drink blood, or both.
Can we somehow replace all the blood sucking mosquitoes with flower only mosquitoes please?
I had no idea there was such thing as a good mosquito. Good to know lmao
I love these so much, how do you turn the life of bugs in to such funny things thank you
I want him to be my teacher
I managed to last until _demon baby_ before I started cackling like a bastard
Teacher: Now class what is the main element of pollination?   Nobody: *Plant sperm*
no shit if you ever struck a deal with netflix and made an animal documentary series i would watch the fuck out of that
Lol the hello mosquitos are cool
Bebeh
This is actually really interesting.
It was NOT a good idea to watch this while eating
These are getting better & better if that's even humanly possible as they're all good.  If this guy's not doing cartoon voice overs he should be  I could listen to his voice all day.  Beebees ❤
This channel coming back to life has brought me great joy again. Maybe him and hugbees could do a collab
The song at the end is fire 🔥
3:49 🤣🤣nice joke frank
No I won't grow up.   Johnston prolly did have a small organ
*BEBBES*
I have been interested in biology for 30 years, studied it and related subjects at the university and i've learned more about mosquitos these last 15 minutes than I have throught the rest of my life.
"...dicked down by a skeeter." That one got me
HellOH
Holy crap it's phase 1 of Spore
2:11 DËMØÑ BÆBY
He said try this at home kids! Go to your local pool...... 🤣😂😍
guess mosquitos can be cool too
This channel is pure Gold.
>https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzAUj5DNHXSkV2jxoRVVlyohxphQK-S9R
The only mosquito I respect is the elephant mosquito
I never want this series of videos to end. I don't know how you do it.
Thanks, I hate it
I’m glad we have spiders
well that is ironic i nearly got bitten by a big mother fkn mosquito... RIP mosquito you will not be making any egg baskets today!! and then this video showed up. XD
Zefrank and Moira Rose studying mosquito larva together: ‘bebez’
I miss the demon baby YouTube videos
I love Snuff!
Magnificent creatures... Still fucking hate 'em tho.
The thumbnail gives me goosebumps lol
I'd happily kill myself to eradicate all mosquitos
Butt first, sorry but first :D
I find it both heartwarming and disgusting that there are mosquito babies made from my blood.
so im confused what are humans good for again?
Please never stop producing these. So hilariously informative.
﴿انَّ اللهَ لَا يَسْتَحى اَنْ يَضَربَ مَثلًا مَا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوقَهَا فَاَمّاَ الَّذيَنَ امَنُوا فَيَعْلمُونَ اَنَّهُ اْلَحُق مِنْ رَبّهِم وَاَمّاَ الَّذيَن كَفَرُوا فَيَقُولُونَ مَاذَا اَرَاَدَ اللهُ بِهذَا مَثَلًا يُضِلُّ بِهِ كَثيراً وَيَهدِى بِه كَثيراً وَمَا يُضِلُّ ِبِه اِلَّا الفَاسِقيَن﴾
One of your best yet. You should do a reindeer video. Reindeer are weird… also plagued by insects. They are heavily researched and yet, still a bit of a mystery.
Does Biden think all his statements are fixed in post? 🤣
❤️
Butt first 🤣
I feel itchy just watching the video.
Love it!
14:20 *Dreamworld Australia wants to know your location*
These videos are becoming so fricking well reserched
simply love your work
Huh I knew that the males didn’t sucked blood but I didn’t know males were also pollinators
It's two a.m. and I am CACKLING. 🤣
It blew my mind thinking bebe mosquito have little piece of my genetic blue print after Mother Mosquito drunk my blood
I one grab a mosquito and ripped it's mouth off
Fuck davod attenbourough
Mosquito has 2 stroke engine
Wow, just wow!
We need a soundtrack for that song at the end.
😆 dale: does that help. 😆 BRILLIANT and HILARIOUS
Interesting
Aww, I never knew a mosquito bite was actually way more awful than it looks. Well played Universe, well played. Man, our species really lucked out with our adolescence, I wish I had gotten a super power.
https://youtu.be/Jw3eq33c9qU
"Look at that the head can turn all around!DEMON BABY"  (Me having flashbacks of 'Yellow Baby')
You can make an adult cartoon/animatic of any one of ze frank's videos.
Why is it that the fact that when I learn something about mosquitoes I cringe, but having you narrate it makes me laugh my ass off! LOL! Still kill all those bastards! LOL!
You're talkin about mosquitoes you should be talk about the zika virus and Bill Gates look it up...
whats i've seeing... its not hard to undestanding but at same time are too hard, but the best is "butt breathing ",
I honestly did not know mos-cue-ee-toes feed on pollen and some never suck blood. 🤯
True fact I killed 20 of em last night and there's still too many in my room  Kill me
I couldn’t stop itching the entire time watching this!
I felt I got stung like 10 times watching this video.
'This looks like the inside view of a teddybear being humped by a chihuahua' - I friggin LOST IT.
Do me a favor... And dont look at what the suggested products are...
Finally! The wait has ended!
Ah, an episode on nature's flying syringes. -_-
Thank you for this gift on a cloudy rainy afternoon after a really shitty day at work 👌🏻
8:06 to skip the ad.
I love the songs so much
This should be aired on Animal Planet
Oh, God. The Lady Gaga joke. I think I peed myself a little bit.
Anyone else suddenly feel like there’s something crawling on your skin or there’s sudden bite pains while watching this?
When zefrank1 says, "behbies." It makes me so happy. EVERY SINGLE TIME.
Great video as usual per zefrank.  Toe biters... yeah he needs to do a video on these little monsters.  Found out about them when my parents bought a house with an aboveground pool.  Oh, look at the cute water striders!  Oh, what's that bug?  Not a water strider let me pick it up and look at.....AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH OW OW DAMMIT OW OW OW &^%#@  <runs to put ice on the blood blister it raised>
If Zefrank was my school teacher, i'd never skip school.
Funniest in a long time  The husband, dog and asshole cat are very angry I'm laughing this loud at 2am
So your saying I'm probably a dad with over millions of children?
I'd like Z to narrate my funeral movie that's all the rage. "OH here's Kimberly at age 14. She looked like she just climbed out of the dumpster behind LL bean while everyone else is dressed for a night at the disco" "Just look at that guy she married. With that pasty white skin and giant blond afro he looks like a giant Q tip." I wonder how much he charges. This way when I die everyone else can die laughing.
I was smack in the middle of Hurricane Ida and it was just days later these nightmares came to make our already bad week worst
I hereby nominate you for Nobel prize in peace and chemistry and physiology
Malaria vaccine on the rise.
Nobel prize for zefrank. I truly believe everything shown in the video is made by him and jerry alone.
Damn it. I didn't want to know how they live, now I'll feel bad murdering them.
1:18 I love the way he says "connect to the roof" at the end here
Love the way he pronounces "babies". Beh-behs.
I love this series!!! 💗💞💗💞💗 Need more elephant mosquito's
Itchiest video I ever watched.
This one of the most entertaining and truly informative episodes in this series. They're all great, but this one was really well done!
Only you could make me feel any warmth toward a mosquito.
this is for a joke.. but is actually ver VERY informative.. not matter what jerry says...
Hilarious and informative
Anyone else itchy?
Interesting and all but now my whole body is itchy
*BABES*
Why is it always bugs 😭
I just susbcribed to your channel. I would like to say... HHHeeeeelllllllllloooooo!!!
"Butt first... Sorry, but first:" gets me every time 😆
oh how we missed you!
No one:    Zefrank: BEHBEHS
No wait I cant take this so Im the step dad of thousands of mosquitoes.
Its mosquitos all the way down, nice.
God I hate bugs
I feel weird.
My mother always taught me not to use the word hate, so I use the word very rarely.. But I will ALWAYS HATE MOSQUITOES! No matter how cool zefrank is and how he makes this video!
These videos go by so fast! This one was over 17 minutes and it seemed like it was three. Thanks Ze Frank, this was so fun and educational. I guess that wiping out these blood suckers could be bad because they pollinate.
Bug facts! This is fun *video gets up to the human bloodsucker facts* I don’t like this anymore
This video makes me somehow not hate mosquitos as much anymore.
Brilliant!
Truuuuuuuuu facts!!!!!
Why is this the funniest content on YouTube? Zefrank has cracked the code with his pop-culture savvy, dirty academia and trademarked use of "bebes." You love it, I love it, the world is better for it. 🏆🥇
Aka, animals I don't care about and in fact..... aprreicate to watch suffer.
"This video is sponsored by Brilliant. LEARN TO THINK" 😂😂😂
Love this content keep it coming a little more frequent!!!!!!! My kids are fans too!!!!
This is the funniest smart thing I've ever watched. Subbed.
I’m sorry… I know I wouldn’t like the answer from a chicken, but what are misquotes useful for?  I’m imagining to pollinate, but like couldn’t we eradicate a certain species; like maybe the asshole species?
Zefrank1 you are amazing thank you so much
Appreciate the effort Z, but I'm not gonna change my stand against these suckers.
omg... I never though of science like that! I am going to use that in the future to explains science!
1) I'm a simple guy. I see a new "True Facts" video by zefrank, I click to watch. That is how I do. 2) 1:37 gave off the same vibe as a bathtub, a muffin, and a go-get-em attitude. Ya feel me?
i wish they wouldve stayed filter feeders or other larvae feeders
So many great one-liners
Currently watching this and scratching a mosquito bite on my leg💀🤦🏻‍♂️
Mosquitoes are the only creature where God themself is like... "F@ck Mosquitoes."
I love how he said “bebbe’s”
thanks for making me laugh out loud
I just came here to say “FUCK mosquitos”
Demon baby
whoever finds a way to kill all mosquitos deserves a Nobel prize
THE ENDING IS GOLD 😂😂😂😂✨ YOU END UP WITH SULKY CHICKEN
Helllooo!  As always, so much fun!  I don't think I've ever been so excited for a video to drop and this was a classic!
Demon baby! That is all.
Some of the people in the comments will definitely think I’m insane, but honestly, the mosquitos are kinda beautiful once you get a good look at them.
HAD TO REWIND JUST TO HEAR HIM SAY BABIES
"The inside view of a teddy bear being humped by a  chihuahua."  LMAO
These are one of my favorite videos on YouTube... Bro you are AWESOME! Your videos are funny and I learn something at the same time as I'm being entertained.  👍
D E M O N B A B Y
He said "grow up" at the same time I started laughing.
Best
It takes that 5%.
I wouldn't care if the bite didn't itch...
You are an unsung hero
mosquitoes all the way down!! Thank you, you've solved my multi-decade existential crisis.
How is Teddy doing?
You either want to watch this or you DO NOT want to watch this.
The amount of things I actually learned during this video is astonishing. Not to mention you had me laughing the entire time. Well done bro! Definitely gonna have to check out your other videos, I thoroughly enjoyed this!
I was about to think Jerry was a goner!
I love and hate the visuals
Its 3am i cant sleep, lets go
I love this serious it is funny AF always looking forward to more
According to 23 and me, I get bite by mosquitoes more than average.
Do a video on the penis stabbing flatworm, PLEASE!!!!!!
"Demon baby" 😂😂😂
Every time he makes these vids I just can’t help but watch
*Moss qou wee toess*
He’s baaaaaack
These videos always make my day. Funny and informative.
I still generally dislike moisquitos.
I have only made it to 3:22 and I have sent to like seven people bro I am so fkn glad you are you . Life is amazing while watching your video s. Ok gotta finish thanks z frfr
I’m not even three minutes in and I’m laughing 😂
"And now it's getting dicked by a skeeter."  Poetry.
8 years of True Facts. Here's to 80 more.
Ik 2 much...
Fun fact/PSA; A study was done, showing that if mosquitos went extinct, there would be no noticeable negative effect on the environment? So if someone found a way to only make all mosquitos extinct, it would only be good.  :)
Thought he replaced Jerry with Dale initially and was kinda heartbroken….
I wouldn’t mind all of these dying
This is the most entertaining Information I've ever consumed.
Funny but not, stand still for 5 sec. In  the southern states (US) you'll change your mind
Of course you can make me laugh about pests I want to genocide. Thank you.
Worst animal by far
I just have to say one thing. “I love you Zefank.” You’re a joy.
I grew up before the Internet, and for fun, we'd sit outside and let mosquitoes land on our hands, which we laid flat. we'd then clench our hands into a fist quickly, and watch the mosquito implode from the rush of blood. we'd even have contests to see who could get the most, or who could implode one the fastest. good times.
I don't like mosquitoes, their small and buzz, and bite you everywhere
Why did he say "roof" like that?! 🤣🤣🤣
OH f*** the mosquitoes, i dont care if some flowers go extinct, every mosquito must suffer a hundred very painful deaths
12:50 those 5% killed so many people, and scientists can't even agree to make them extinct
Actually learned something in between laughing, good job ze frank. :)
man its been 2 months since you post a video :( pls dont do it again
omg i missed you
...tried being quiet while my family slept but his "demon baby" had me cackling
9:14
I died at the demon babies. 🤣
Yay!  That was great!
Whats the difference between a mosquito and a hooker? The hooker won't stop sucking when you slap
Bravo!
I need to go to sleep.
Hands up, who else was getting worried about Ze since it had been so long without a video?! Not complaining - very happy and relieved to get new sillies in my inbox
This is amazing
Thank God Chickens don't Drink our Blood Like the mosquito 🦟
Bibays
I’m amazed it took you so long to get to mosquitos 😂
Ze, you've been missed. I like learning and listening to you. Mosquito facts and proclivities make me itchy. Peace
I killed a mosquito as you said there are mosquito babies made from me. IDC. My blood can die by my blood.
I knew mosquitoes were also pollinators, but never knew there were mosquitoes that eat other mosquitoes… or steal blood from the female mosquitoes… These videos never fail to surprise me with new information!
can we have album for all the songs? love it
Last year I MET the elephant mosquito Toxorhynchites in my yard! He pollinated the coneflowers for me. I would hire him.
You forgot to divulge at a certain age humans lose the ability to hear the frequency of sound emitted by mosquitoes
“Who hasn’t lost a child or two at the water park” I’M DYING 😆😆😆
If you're Gonna eat me? I'd rather you start with my face first?
screw you for making me laugh with the "butt first, sorry; but first," joke every time
I hate mosquitoes but I love these videos
HelLO!
Y'all i was watching this vid and a mosquito just landed on my arm she was a big mf too.
Mmm, another wonderful video!  I've picked up some tips from this video that might help me to build an effective mosquito trap, with whiny female mosquito noises, stinky socks, black-and-white checkerboard patterns, and a dark-colored mass to really lure the bloodsucking little buggers in!
ah, good, another zefrank video...i was needing another dose of "behbeh" talk...
OMG YES LETS GO NEW VIDEO I LOVE U!!! u never fail to make me laugh 💖
Oh, MY WORD.. This is the crown jewel. Bravo sir.
👍🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Wait minute, so if I let a mosquito drink my blood I can pass my DNA onto thousands of mosquito larva? So being a father without the downsides. Amazing
4:29 Specifically ARTrave intro
True fact: mosquitoes suck
Ok, we're done here, just kill 'em with fire!
trypophobia, I think, and thank you so so so much for the warning. I saw exatly ONE bebe coming out and I noped out in perfect timing and survived it.
That was the worst cob of corn, I have EVER seen!!!!
I simply love your delivery, both scientifically, musically and humorously. I did attempt to support your page on patreon but found their desire for personal information and access to other media accounts a little bit overwhelming at this point which is disappointing to say the least.
"DEMON BABY" 🤣
Can someone tell me, wtf god was thinking when he was making this?
$
there is a promising malaria vaccine. mankind's most deathly enemy may be conquered soon
This entire video made me itch.
The only documentaries that make me laugh til I cry, instead of just cry. 🦟👏🏼💀 3:55 - that’s a facehugger
I have watched zefranks videos. all of them. only youtube channel thats happened to me with
I didn’t know moskeeters were valuable pollinators. Or 98% of this. Pretty cool 😆  edit: FLEAS??
im still ok with human mosquito bite-y bite-y going away
Thanks for the trypophobia warning. I have that in a serious way.
Fukin hate these things
THA BEEBES
DONT JUST FILM THEM SMASH THEM TO BITS! THEY ARE LITERALLY KILLING EVERY SINGLE PERSON, ANIMAL, PLANT, AND FUNGUS IN EXISTENCE WITH THEIR INVASIVE NEEDLE FEEDING! END THIS DEMONIC LIFE FORM
Poor Johnston and his tiny organ
Good God, this video makes me itchy.
Petition to always put, "That's how the ____ Do" in ZeFrank's videos.
Because that is how the mosquitoes do.
Tease for the next aliens sequel. These things are creepier and weirder that the adults. Darn demon babies 😱😂
Oh how I missed these
HelLoooo!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
i love how he cant help laughing at his own incredible jokes sometimes lol. like @ 15:35
3:13 is, i believe, a gaint waterbug.
nature be freaky.
This is the only channel I never skip the ads on - gotta get zefrank that dough so this gold never ends!
I would not have guessed that mosquito larvae are so damn weird. Also, why can’t there be more of those non-blood-mosquitoes?
Aside from the malaria thing..  I still deal with mosquitoes over horse flies..  Mosquitos leave a bit of a bite  section..  But horse flies their bite is so much painful..  F*** those jackasses..
Thank you for telling me about the hole thing before it got worst
who else expected him to say "Learn to think... JERRY!!!"
I’ve never been so disgusted and fascinated at the same time
Word up toxerenchides
"That pole on bumper cars that connects to *tha rrrroof!* "
Honestly the best thing about this video, aside from Zefrank's humor, is learning that mosquitoes aren't just there to ruin your day.   They do, in fact, play an active role in maintaining our world's various ecosystems.
And why we're at it we can get  zFrank saying hello for a notification.
Finally. Some good fucking mosquito slander.
All right I need that ending tune for a ringtone it's too fun
Thanks oney
You are so damn hilarious and informative at the same time! You'd be the best teacher ever, probably change a shit ton of people's lives just being you. I think this may be one of your best videos.
I mean yeah mosquitoes are awesome but the whole malaria thing..  But horse flies... I lived in Michigan so that's why I will call him..  They bite and they hurt..a lot. And even more annoying than mosquitoes..
Mosquitos... most useless, annoying insects of all time. Proof there is no god.
Honestly I'd rather deal with the swarm of mosquitoes than horse flies...  Don't know how to pronounce their geology.. I call them horse flies.. There bite is much more painful than mosquitoes.. and much more annoying..
But mosquitos was so annoying. And don't get me started a horse flies,  Much more annoying.. mosquitoes are not that painful and can be easily ignored. But or horse flies those painful samba b******.  What's the difference between those two..
I love, love, love these True Facts!!
8:31 is the most 21st century humor here
Oh, hey, that’s my cousin!
'A hen is only an egg's way of making another egg.' ~ Samuel Butler
this guy hard trying to be funny , annoyning as hell bro and he says baby in a cringe way change the narator brozay
"Who hasn't lost a child or two at a water park?" lmaoooo
I watched a... film, let's call it, called the Scourge of Evil literally yesterday and I'm seeing a disconcerting number of parallels in terms of appendages... Think I'll go pray for my immortal soul now 🙃
I'm not one to be willfully ignorant on the subject of scientific facts so my mind is actually rather blown that mosquitoes (bane of the earth) are actually pollinators and not just parasites. I still believe they should be eradicated, but now with longterm unseen effects! Yay!
the accent really slipping these days
Watching this fills me with so much anger...
It amazes me we've gone through so many years of researching these fuckers when we could have been eliminating them from existence. Humans are literally the worst.
My back, arms and neck were tingling watching those mosquitoes hatch
No one  Nobody That one baby mosquito:*SPEEDRUNS LIFE*
Surprisingly the beginning didn’t trigger my phobia
Why the hell does the mosquito emerging from the water look like an evil anime villan's entrance.
I'm just imagining a guy trying to do an impression of Morgan Freeman making these videos.
The mosquito on the flower at 6:17 looks like it has a go-pro...or a small Predator shoulder laser blaster
The mosquito emerging from the water was a very festive way to start the video 😂
Love me some zefrank❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The "butt first" joke never fails to make me laugh 😂
Has anyone proposed just overwhelming the world with the no bitey mosquito and let them thin out the other species with larval warfare?
Is there a link to how they did the camera work for the mosquito feeding in the tissue?
Only female mosquitoes suck blood. The males suck juices from plant leaves.
These always make my day better
"Demon baby" 😂😂😂😂
I’ve always thought that when I get to Heaven, I was going to ask God about spiders, snakes & Fn mosquitoes. Do they (mosquitoes) provide any kind of benefit to the environment? I think not. Are they food for frogs, lizards and other creatures? I hope so. So why the hell hasn’t these creatures done anymore to eliminate these sack of manure mutha-Effen mosquitoes?
That intro was the best
You're videos are absolutely mind blowing!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏 I learn soooo much, and yet I'm falling about laughing, at the same time! 🤣🤣🤣 You're absolutely unique in what you do!   Thank you....for once again, giving us SUCH a treat!! xx
"Play it subtle, elephant mosquito." "Subtle. Hel-LO!"
Yo fuck mosquitoes even if they are pollinators
hey remember teddy bear surgery
Elephant mosquitoes are the Uncle Leo of the mosquito world. "HELLO!" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz_DslzN2IA&t=400s
Toxorhynchites good. Anopheles bad.
As fascinating and hilarious as this video was...  I still HATE mosquitoes. All mosquitoes. Especially the bloodsucking ones.
Moskow-Ee-Tow
So there are pedophile mosquitos? lol
Woah, mosquitoes are actually pretty cool. I still hate them tho, except for the Elephant Mosquito, that one is a bro.
6:06 That moment when Zefrank forces you to the realization that insect flower pollination is just science babble for what's basically an interspecies gangbang.
Terrifying
If this can make forget about the demon spawn that bit me the other day, then I'll be     What I was gonna say.
Know thy enemy
DEMON BABY.   Haha.   I hate everything about these pests. Well, except for the pollinating part.
There’s a Skeeter on my peter whack it off  there’s a Skeeter on my peter whack it off  there’s a Skeeter on my peter and I think it’s going to eater there’s a Skeeter on my peter whack it off Ouch
We have plenty of pollinators and a shortage of bees. These things can return to Hell where they came from.
you have bots in your comment section targeting me zefrank1
I never knew that they pollinate before biting us.  So they do have a purpose.  Besides feeding other things
Do you think mosquitos can transmit covid , or the “vaccine”
This was amazing, thank you again for all of your great work sir.  I looked at one in New England under a kids microscope and it appeared like it had little tiny feathers around the wings.  The behavior observed by them attacking each other is very interesting.  I thought the earwig was the only other one that protects their youing.
DEMON BABY. I don’t know why but that got me good.
Another fact about mosquitos are the males dont drink blood. Only the females because of their eggs.
oh frick just watched a marcus haus video on 2x speed and now coming to this in regular speed is like one word every century XD oh shit my tryphophobis kicks in ...
Congratulations, I officially hate mosquitoes less than I did a few minutes ago. That's a heck of a feat!
This is one of the best True Facts intros ever. Like a horror movie.
16:26
soo they are taking my blood right ? my dna ? does that mean i am kinda their father or they are related to me cuz they have my blood
I think my ptsd could be because of mosquitoes sneaking up on my ear
I just love this channel in ways not pronounceable in human speech
I spent the entire video feeling itchy and looking for mosquitoes that were on me.
Youre a genious sir
2:11 I'm laughing harder than I should
He's here!
thanks i was horney...     not any more
fun fact: mosquitoes use ur blood to make eggs therefore every male that has been bitten by a mosquito is no loger a virgin
OMG CAN YOU DO AXOLOTLS PLEASEEE🥺🥺
4:36 "The elephant mosquito emerges a little more like....." "✨ He-LLOOO!! ✨"
Mosquitoes are fascinating creatures. Annoying, but fascinating.
You managed to make mosquitoes kinda cute. Good job.
I... Had no idea that mosquitoes were pollinators and now I hate them less... To be clear, I still despise them but slightly less... Like... 1% less. And you know who's to blame? The 5% of mosquitoes that ruin summer fun and my legs!
"A snuffleupagus reimagined as a dildo"
I wish Zefrank was my science teacher in high school.
But how do we eradicate them forever?
The purpose of these animals is to be assholes.
Yeah the holes cheap me out!!!
my kink is zefrank's voice
that sponsor "learn to think" XD
I Love your videos!!! cant wait for the next one!
Somebody should patch that shit outta the game, shit's obsolete.
He's back!!
50% of videos of mosquitoes is them pooping or peeing
This episode was so over-due.  Even the American Indians hate mosquitoes, and everything is sacred to them. I still remember visiting an Ojibwe Indian reservation and hearing one of the elders tell us the story of how mosquitoes came to be. Long story short, a shape-shifting monster was eating people from the tribe. The tribe hatched a plan to kill it by digging a pit and dumping flaming coals on the evil creature, burning it to ashes. They then went atop a great hill, and spread the ashes to the wind expecting closure, but the creature was so evil and foul, its ashes turned into mosquitoes, and has been feeding on humans ever since.  Great story, and it makes me feel good that people who revere nature so much still hate mosquitoes as much as I do.
"But first," 6:40 really got me 😂
*helloooo*
The Louisiana State Bird
We have a friend who keeps chooks. One came into the house while he was doing a podcast and laid am egg. Them she had to tell him about it because she was so proud of herself. We could hear it all on the "poddy". All chooks talk!
do dancing birds next? or birds of paradise? EDIT: OMG HOUSE PETS
Would it be so bad for the environment if we just…didn’t have mosquitoes?
I did my Senior thesis yrs ago on the Culex Tarsalis which causes Encephalitis......usual host = the horse.. .
laughed until my back teeth hurt...
I made the most inappropriate laugh at the beginning
Watching this video made me feel itchy.
Honestly I think all the meds im on but they just don't go after me
So even mosquitoes have mosquitoes.
Morgan Freeman, is that you?
Please don't ever stop making these videos.
7:53 I was today years old when I found out that zefrank, which I had been pronouncing 'ZEE-FRANK' for the past 8 years was actually pronounced 'ZEY-FRANK'. My entire adult life has been a lie.
“Don’t want that mixed in with the porn. Someone might get the wrong idea” I mean, you’re absolutely right tho 🤣🤣🤣
Longest two months of my life since your last upload
This is up there with the bobbit worm in squeemishness.
People are so mind blown when i tell them a mosquito is the deadliest animal on planet Earth.
Trypophobia ooooooooooooooooo Nooooooooooooo
put a little dish soap in their pool and see them drown from to low surface tension
Love your videos man
Am I the only one that looks at these insects pooping and wish that I could do it as neatly and cleanly as they do, all-out, no-mess?
Everyone these days talking about war and politics but we really need to be talking about misquotes
Great  video! I'm still interested about your background though :P Do you have any experience in biology or is it full media/journalism or what ever? Or do you just hire someone to fact check? Anyways, great and entertaining videos with some actual information. Thanks.
I would have been so disappointed if this video hadn't ended in  hellooooo
i love this fucking channel....
Eggs in the genus *insert joe Biden soundclip*
It is mosquitos all the way down! lol
My god I missed you! 😂😂😂😂 love it!!!
DEMON BBABY
Thank you.I loove your content!!! It should be mandatory science curriculum!!
Literally had to go make coffee during the holes.
That genus second pronunciation got me dead 💀
Is this new?? I think this is new!!  It's Oct '21 so MAYBE it's new.... It's about time. If it's new.
true facts: Jerry
Wishes do come true. I was SOOO hoping to see a new Zefrank vid, and what to my wondering eyes does appear, you guessed it. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!.
YOU grow up now!! dammid
Bebbes🍼
He picks topics based on the weirdest thing the animal does with it's butt
there’s beautiful in this title. a mosquito definitely wrote it.
He also does Dear Kitten!  Love him!
DEEMIN BEBBÉ
“Interesting” I say while i reach for the bug spray
It's called trypophobia I have it and maybe warn before u show the phobia just a thought heh
Dale?? What happened to Jerry? Is he on holiday?
Dale? what happened to Jerry? :( Oh there he is XD
This means that if the gmo mosquito ppl are successful in eradicating aedes, then certain wildflower species might go extinct? 😟 sigh, take my blood!
The mosquito song is up there with the koala song.. 😅👍
I do not believe the bug he won't google is a "toe biter, water scorpion or water bug". The bug in the video has a single protrusion for a 'mouth hole'. I am now obsessed with knowing what it is. Will somebody please discover what it is?
Hilarious! One of my favorites recently :)
I didn't even know there were multiple kinds of mosquitoes tbh
5:28 Me: still giggling Zefrank: Grow up.
This made getting bit by a mosquito waaaaaay worse lol
Incredible footage!
666K views? How fitting
“HELLOOO” hahaha
If you are breathing through your butt, it is probably better zefrank, to be eaten but first. With your air cut off you should pass out faster. 😁
Watching at 666k views ;)
Trypophobia WARNING: Start the video at 1:02 . Thank me later.
2:10 caught me offguard 🤣🤣🤣  : demon bebe
It's mosquitos all the way down. . . Always has been.
A very entertaining and informational video , I enjoyed it .
2:01 the mosquito was filter feeding water but stopped when he saw the guy in front prepared to poop. 🤣🤣🤣
Hel-lOOooOo!!!
Mosquitos are my least favorite thing to deal with in life…but I can’t stop watching.
I have to know, what are those beautiful little green things it’s eating at 2:13?
Wait, what’s the reason they’re only around in the summer?
Love your video's. Missed you. Hope you film more.
this is the worst but im so invested. also im concerned about the people that volunteer to be bitten after seeing the tendrils searching around under the skin
Do leeches the eat off each other and so many kinds still used in medicine to this day
"this looks like the inside view of a teddy bear being humped by a chihuahua" SIR!! YOU CANT JUST,,,,,,,,,,,,,SAY THINGS
🦂 I have watched this guy for a long time and I always learn something new while laughing. I hope to eventually see him talk about SCORPIONS next. 🦂
You are a fucking genius Z!🤩😍🤩🦟
Love your voice
I have no idea why I'm watching this while I'm trying to sleep.
*BACK BITS!!* 😆😆
Sad ghost is the best way of describing it
*Mosquitoes are the true vampires of the animal kingdom!!*
Fun and informative!
dude i told you this in confidence! what the hell man
I'm so glad you're using a more natural voice in your narration than you did back in the day. I thought the old voice was hilarious, but I love the more conversational tone and hearing you laugh to yourself.
I am now scarred for life.
Does this mean I'm a dad?
mosquito is pog but not
Amazing everytime
I'm itchy now
We have been waiting for this one. But every day of waiting was worthed it.
Finally, a new one of these. I've been waiting forever.
What I learned here is that because mosquitoes have Mother Nature's most traumatizing and difficult childhood they grow up as angsty and edgy teenagers, and now their life mission is reach adulthood just to irritate and harm all other life forms that is bigger than them.
U should definitely upload these two song on spotify
That beginning reminds me of a pimples popping video lol
God Damnit the mosquito song at the end bruh
720p? You disgust me
The footage, the narration, the edition, everything on this video is amazing!
So when I got to bed and notice a mosquito in my room, I dont have to kill it because there is a 50:50ish chance that its a male that is just looking for sugar and not my blood?  well dang
😂 12:05
Who's Dale? Hi Jerry.
I love learning about wildlife.
Thank you for another brilliant science lesson... you know, we'd prolly learn science better if all teachers were like you, j/s. Kids love your videos please keep making them! 😍🥰
the only thing wrong with true facts is that zeeman can't do 1 a week. gratz zeeman. nailed it again. ...butt first.  that never gets old
TEDDY BEAR HUMPED BY A CHIHUAHUA
Next time I see a mosquito, I'll be like "Ah, my son"
I love Mosquitos.
Anyone else yelling “Kill it” throughout the whole video?
Jerry! Where is the Full HD? Where is it Jerry! No, it did not get sucked out of the monitor by Viroquitos. That's not even a thing Jerry. You just forg...put that flysquatter down Jerry. I am immune to that th.. Ow. ouch, Stop! Ouch! Jerry!!
I wait patiently for this man to put out new videos and it's always worth it.
That thing is called a Water Bug.
Waiting for that bot to reply as I watch this nightmare fuel right before my very eyes.
How would you like it if someone asked "what you're good for" Jerry?
As a child, I used to drag out hundreds of these things (in shrimpy form) and let them bake in the sun. It brings me great joy to know they were mosquito bebbies
zefrank1, has the ability to combine Science and Porn! God bless you Sir!
To the Elephant Mosquitoe, in the words of the Abridged Shiro Emiya, "You may stay."
Nice video as always :D Was always wondering what mosquitos actually were existing for other than food for other animals. I didn't know they were also pollinaters!
The ending 😂
Another good catchy tune. Thanks, Ze
Helllooo!!!
Glad you’re back!! I missed my bebehs 😃
Like always, the song made specifically for a Zefrank episode is better then a lot of songs made for whatever reason at whatever time(I just really like the songs and I wanted to say that)
3:10 without googling it, it looks like a toe biter
MORE!!!
please keep doing these vids....
Trypophobia.. and yes I have it.. but  I'm still gonna watch this.  Also, could you make one on scorpions?
🤣
*D e a m o n  B a b y*
Congrats on trending
Zefranks commentary aside, the HD footage and scientists' research work behind it is amazing
The mosquitos hatching is fine for trypophobia, too uniform to be creepy, like honeycomb.
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee -mosquito
Still tho.. fuck mosquitoes
Just watching and listening made me itchy...
Such amazing creatures. Shame that you have to kill them on sight to protect you from potential deathly illness.
I want to thank you for posting this. I've had a life long hatred for mosquitoes and this video has given me a greater understanding and appreciation for this group of insects.
Amazing footage
Love. True. Facts. More, please.
9:58 ~look, they’re riding on it~ 🥰
Can we all agree on a plan to eradicate these  mofos .. seriously...
I've been watching you for many many years and now you're #11 on trending. Congrats zefrank. We love you
When I was a kid friend of mine acquired some mosquito larvae and they were in a small container of water and we topped it with Turbo Molecular Vacuum Pump Oil!
“Dale?” What happened to Jerry? Oh good, Jerry is there too!
Yes, I'm a biology professor but suffer major trypophobia. Thanks for the warning. I'm still itching at just the thought.
"... and now it's getting dicked by a skeeter." - I spat my beer out on my keyboard.
Saitama: finally a worthy opponent
Lol 😆 You can't just watch his videos only once 😂
Itchy…I feel very itchy…
So, I have a massive phobia of anything mosquito shaped. My fiancé and I have not missed a single episode of True Facts but I did debate on skipping this one. Some how, you managed to keep my attention and didn't raise my stress levels to the point where I wanted to quit the video. You actually made me laugh with this creepy little bastards, so fantastic video :)
AKA: "Everything You Ever Wanted to Hear Zefrank Tell You About Mosquitoes" (Rated R) :-).
4:41,6:40,16:56
Quite a kinky episode
One more bug video & I’m unsubscribing.
Zefrank: "grow up" My partner: "is he talking to his audience, himself, or his script writer?" Me: "all of the above"
Does anyone else sometimes feel that ever so tiny pinch when a mosquito bites you? Just me?  Also, thank you for giving me a good rebuttal for when people say we should just get rid of all mosquitoes
Humanity has driven SO MANY species into extinction, so many beautiful animals either completely extinct or on the brink of it. Yet the blasted mosquito is still here. Maybe one day humanity will come together and kill it off so that I may finally sleep peacefully and without distractions. I guess the one that doesn't drink blood may live
For anyone wondering, that bug zefrank doesn’t want in his search history is a water bug, or toe biter
I love these videos! Please keep making them 🙏
I got bitten 53 times by mosquitoes on labor day and got west nile. Fuck mosquitos
yeahhh still despise them, plenty of other bugs that pollinate and probably better to. Hate them. Kill them alll
This physics of the mouthparts and the bounty of footage of mosquito turds were truly terrifying but I couldn't stop watching.
ZeFrank could narrate my life, and it would be the better for it.
A long video nice
I'm itchy now...
"now that baby dead baby" i need to go to the funeral of a child so i can day this to the parents
Mosquitos are still the worst thing. I'm pretty sure there's a study out there that if they all died out there would be no significant impact on the world other than becoming a better place.
Frank ur shits awesome and u should do more videos
FARTED !
Ok that mosquito at the beginning looked like it was a horror movie monster that was slowly ascending from the floor and then ready to chase after the character
So..... Can we just target the ones that do suck our blood?? Leave the rest for the ecosistema, but kill the bastard that do
2 minutes in the video and I already love it
“Hel-LLOO”
That was a very late warning. ~X(
Spore
This channel needs so much more love. My God are you fucking funny. Information with built in comedy. If schools taught kids like this, I bet we'd beat Asia for once in average IQ 😂
"Learn to think!"  What great advice for this day and age!
Somewhere around minute 2:00 " Demon Baby " =))))))
My work-study job at Cornell had me working in an entomology lab, where I dissected pregnant mosquitoes under a microscope for three years. I dreamt about them for many years afterward. One of the best jobs I ever had.
Who lost it at "DEMON BABIES?"
"It kinda looks like a depressed ghost, maybe he accidentally said boob one time and everyone laughed at him"  The wittiness never stops guys ngl
This is just the worst video 😰
you mean i’m a momma???!!?!!
butt first-
His subtle grow up got me
We need a True Facts on Jerry. It must be.
One of my all time favorite channels. Thank you for all that you do 😊
HELLO!!
This is gonna be one of those vids that’s got a lot of views and is really old.
These animals suck.
This is one of the most interesting videos I've seen in quite a while. About to binge watch some of your other content.
Do a cockroach episode and a scene with cockroaches laying eggs to terrifies people
That poor chicken
Ah the mosquitos! Texas state bird every 6 months
Amazing stuff.
I love how he warns about that phobia 5 seconds after the picture of the eggs was there
This was......hard to watch
I freakin love the way you say baby/babies. LOL
17 minutes of Zefrank? That's a dream 😍😍😍!!!
A mosquito, my libido. YEAH!
WOW! WOW! WOW! Awesome cameragraphy/photography!!!
This reminds me of Cell from Dragon Ball Z
Bro this guy is a fucking comedian lmao
"It can be tough being a mosquito bebby" Good, suffer, there is not one person that wants their life to be anything less than constant torment.
You are the freshest and most fly on YouTube.
"This looks like a needle but it's not''. It sure feels like it when those flying bastards suck my blood.
Tomato

Butt first….but first never gets old.

Watching this while getting bitten by a fckin mosquito
Wow the first minute was mouth watering looks absolutely delicious
this video is so so cool and informative and also my entire body itches now
I thought I couldn't hate them more. Great content.
Is that song on Spotify? I would love to use it as my ringtone.
0:20 What the f-     HAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA
Real talk, I’d kill for an album of your songs
We know you’re a mosquito.
Mosquitos have gotten such a bad rap just because a few of them bite humans and spread diseases… it’s too bad that they are so annoying, yet so critically important to the food web in many ecosystems.
Yay!
Can never tire of hearing him say "bebiss"
Can't we just create something to get rid of mosquitoes to the point of extinction? I mean we've caused the extinction of most animal species might as well get rid of these fucked up creatures.
I missed these.
Can you please do a video on spiky orb weaver spiders?  The females look so scary but aren't actually as dangerous (to humans) as they look.
10/10 best True Facts video ever posted - and I’ve been watching ever since the third one came out. This was great, I learned so much!
"Hello". Lol...i love your content!!
Missed the part they become invisible.
Ive never needed a flamethrower more than now.
I love this series. It’s informative and entertaining.  Speaking of informative and entertaining (and disgusting), when do we get a hagfish video?
4:37 _HEL-LOOO!!_ 😂😂😂
Fsking. hate. squitos.
We're so happy you're back.   Thank you. Thank you. Laughs are getting harder and harder to find these days.
"Pew-pah-teh"   "Hellllooooooooo!"
Such talent=quality entertainment!! Took way too long for me to find you... well it's all for a reason. Good day.
"And people are very good at killing people."
I would love to see a DVD with all of these maybe with some exclusive content. Learning has never been so fun!
Hell__ooOO000!!
You're telling me i'm a father possibly? Oh god I hope they dont come for child support.
Amused.  Genocide is bad.  Except for Mosquitos.  Genocide of Mosquitos is good.  Except Elephant Mosquitos apparently.  Don't genocide Elephant Mosquitos.
I have been annoying my cousin the whole day by constantly referring to her new daughter as a "beh-beh".
This is still one of the best channels ive ever subbed to...
Yessssss. Liked it. Now going to watch it. ❤️✌🏻✌🏻
Knowing that some mosquito babys are made from my blood truly puts into question how many kids i have
I want to get some of those "elephant" mosquitos. They sound like a lot of fun and useful.
God I hate mosquitoes even more
Elephant mosquito is automatically my favorite
I don’t know if I can survive this. Mosquitoes just look too freaky.
Lol I cant get over mosquitoe BEBEHS
Dengue
I still hate them, but thanks for the education and also keeping it lighthearted. Your humor definitely fit this type of content so well.
1:24 anal pyramid?!  Just like the dragonfly larvae?!
AMAZING MAN kkkkkkk great video, thank youuuuu
Getting d*cked by a skeeter needs to become a common phrase
Sounds like they have quite a useful Johnson XD ... OK I'll grow up now
There is just one way I can think of how this series has remained so damn funny this whole time, and that is simply this: Zefrank is a genius, because that's just how he do.
Really freaky!
So this is why edward can find bella anywhere
A mosquito is flying in front of my screen while I watch this.     ....... Nope, it didn't change my mind in killing it.
This is actually really interesting. I'm learning things about mosquitoes I never knew
Great script, lost my sides
you forgot to say " and that is how... mosquitos do "
h e L L O !
Just watching this is making me itchy.
why can't learning in school be this fun?
9:36 That mosquito was savage trying to suck blood from that flamango’s eye
I now hate mosquitoes 5% less Truly an achievement
14:40 Angry mosquitoes
Love and appreciate these videos so much. I learn new things about animals/insects with each one....even if it's about bugs I dislike with a strong passion (to put it nicely).
Now I hate mosquitoes even more
Fuck. Mosquitoes.
Gods, this traumatised me.
He sounds like a Diva when he says HELLO! 4:41
My day has been improved greatly. Even if it's short 5min videos , we want more it
2:27 so that's where Spore got it from.
This is the most professional shitpost I've ever seen
10:50 THAT'S why my damn ankles always get torn to freaking shreds by these little bastards!
Like always, you do not disappoint. Keep them a comin!
If girl mosquitos didn't give me itchy itchy juice....I wouldn't care is she bit me... it's the itchy itchy juice that I hate.......unless malaria decided to raise its ugly head....    But,  males are cute with their fluffy antenna. Looooooooove the mosquito song.
Other moquito: rises like a vampire ready to find a victim. Elephant mosquito: SURPRISE MF!!
We need to breed these elephant mosquitoes somehow  Kill two birds with one stone and take care of the mosquito problem while getting more pollinators around
Just watched this on a 42 inch TV so that scarred me...
As someone who is highly allergic to mosquito bites when bitten these facts alone are making me itchy but I'll tolerate it for the humor, Snuffleupagus as a dildo killed me!🤣
I love your true facts  I have watched every single one I hope you keep making  them good work and ty
I recently took a job as a mosquito exterminator. This video serves as excellent motivation.
Please make a collaborative video with Casual Geographic.
Okay my trypophobia doesn’t get triggered often and I was like okay I can handle this but then 🤢
I hate so much to like a video on mosquitoes. It’s Zefrank, I can’t help it.
i'm trying to be brave about this but🤢
I have ventvisors on my work car, and at the end of summer, if I sit and fuck off for even 5 minutes out there, there will be like 12 in the car and I’ll have 6 bites. Their ability to find a meal is pretty amazing.
Come on, bluegill/crappie, do your damn job!
Fun fact about that butt breathing joke: Research suggests you can metabolize oxygen through the digestive tract but it requires stripping away the intestinal lining.  So it would be more like spread em, blow the lining of your guts out of your ass then suck in hard
Watching this makes me itch
All of this cannon?
https://youtu.be/Jw3eq33c9qU
finally yay i missed these
Johnson's organ / skeeter peter
😆 the way he says..beybee
Bloody marvelous!
Bebbies!!!!!
I never want the videos to end
"Its mosquitoes all the way down" Nooooo *rick and morty theme*
and that's why we kill these things with fire and poison and what ever causes frogs to turn gay.
These videos do not come out nearly often enough!
Horsehair worm please!!!!!
The one you love the most on the way to life. That will hurt you the most. What would happen if you find so many perfect people in life, if there is no love.
great, now i'm itchy, thanks, zefrank, very cool.
Only Zefrank could make a mosquito video that i watch.
The truest of facts
I'll never pass by an elephant mosquito without saying "HELLoOOO!" ever again.
True fact i kill every mosquito that lands anywhere on my body
Brilliant: Einstein's photo holding the Poincare light cone named after Minkowski. xD
“Dale?” What happened to Jerry? Oh good, Jerry is there too!
I was having a terrible day then this pops up in my feed and literally 20 seconds in I'm howling with laughter!   ZeFrank you are bloody amazing! Hilarious VO, incredible footage and 'I'm blown away!' Production values! Thank you so much for this brilliant show!
I see, so the Elephant Mosquito (male and female i assume-), and ALL the male mosquitos don't drink blood, they are all about flowers, however, the FEMALE mosquitos will always bite you and suck your blood, so, when we kill a mosquito, when are killing a woman, and we used to kill a lot...a LOT...of mosquitos, so guess what, we are a anti-woman mosquito society.
Few things in the world make me as happy as a new Zefrank1 video.
"and now it's getting dicked by a skeeter" 😂🤣😭😭
Mosquitoes need to be extinct…
The footage in this is awesome
Mosquito larva hatching? More like Anopheles Navidad
Zefrank is Deadpool but a biology
I really want a "Let's back up a bit..." Tshirt
Fuck mosquitos  This post was made by human gang
I wish we could make them extinct
Brilliant performance-and I mean not just mosquito song!😂😂👌
Very funny and informative. All i have learned leads me to one conclusion.  Burn it with FIRE!!!
This video pueces are terrifying
You don’t want anything a culex mosquito carries I caught a severe case of Japanese B Abovirus from a number of their bites…..Ruined life as I knew it.
So not ALL mosquitoes should be extinct
Imagine a world where mosquito's doesnt drink human blood
Thank you!   I love your videos, and always learn some interesting things while laughing my butt off.
the song at the end is hilarious
"grow up"🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm so happy you're back
yet another classic my friend...so witty- i swear you kill me every time dude! thanks so much for you dedication and for sharing this talent w/ us
I can think of no better person than zefrank to soften the blow of the terrible news that mosquitoes, much like wasps, are Ecologically Important Actually and that my hatred of them is thus counterproductive.
15:36 the forbidden rice
Love the vids man
My favorite so far… lmao!! 😂
You are just an amazing man!
15:15   When it's too hard so you just made up something.
I still hate them
Ok the Elephant mosquito is now my favorite animal
So we hate Mosquitos cause they bite us and kill as many as we can, Moskitos bite us and kill a lot of humans by injecting their biohazard weaponry... I think we have officially declared war against blood sucking Moskitos and the Elephant Moskitos are our Allies!
Do a true facts on jellyfish
Sooooooo many bebays....
15:28 mmmmm rice
Learnin and laughin. Hell yeah. Good show sir good show!
Before, I hated mosquitos out of ignorance. Now, thanks to you, I hate mosquitos out of purpose. But thank you for teaching me that not all mosquitos are bloodsucking pests.
His videos always makes me laugh and happy and learning new things about different insects and animals  really appreciate your videos
That was brilliant, thank you.
No. 11 on trending! Damn Zefrank ♥️
Behold! the DEMON BABY
Damn it's always fun to watch a new episode of this series
Well, this is a video that is likely to appeal to people with any number of phobias.
Most liked person talks about the most hated creature
“Now you’re getting dicked by a skeeter” 🤣🤣🤣 there are way too many hysterical lines in this that I can’t handle it
You make my day 😌
Never thought I'd ever call mosquitos cool but here we are.
I am in love with the elephant mosquitoes
Mosquito = Parasito
I’d just like to say thank you to your team and for reaching out to the scholars behind this research and sharing it with us ❤️
all my life i've been telling myself that i hope mosquitoes die all at once, but if elephant mosquitoes are also gonna die, then i take it back. best mosquito species indeed.
Oh I hate this. Great video!
One of the grossest yet but I’m here for it anyway😩
I immediately went to kill it once it's not larva anymore
Yooo ..!!!zefrank's video's up.... awesome....😂🤣😅😎
That little monster at 3:07 is a water bug called Water Scorpion, it's bite is extremely painful. For you.
That hole warning wasn’t sufficient! I became entranced and my eyes got watery 🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭
Mosquito in the Quran :  what GOD say about the mosquito  Chapter 2 Al-Baqarah verse 26  GOD in arabic name ALLAH say : إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَسْتَحْيِي أَنْ يَضْرِبَ مَثَلًا مَا بَعُوضَةً فَمَا فَوْقَهَا ۚ فَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا فَيَعْلَمُونَ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّهِمْ ۖ وَأَمَّا الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا فَيَقُولُونَ مَاذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِهَٰذَا مَثَلًا ۘ يُضِلُّ بِهِ كَثِيرًا وَيَهْدِي بِهِ كَثِيرًا ۚ وَمَا يُضِلُّ بِهِ إِلَّا الْفَاسِقِينَ  Surely Allah is not ashamed to set forth any parable– (that of) a Mosquito or any thing above that; then as for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord, and as for those who disbelieve, they say: What is it that Allah means by this parable: He causes many to err by it and many He leads aright by it! but He does not cause to err by it (any) except the transgressors.     The Quranic word used for Mosquite is specifically that of a female mosquito. Of course, there is a significant wisdom in why the Quran mentions female mosquito specially. However, this wisdom came into light hundreds of years after the verse was sent down, as a result of some scientific researches. As you read in details, mosquitoes which suck people’s blood and use it for their eggs are female mosquitoes. This is why the Quran chose the female mosquito for the similitude in order to point out to this reality.
Gears1984?
Wow I thought I couldn't dislike them more...
*They can pollinate all they want, preferably far away from me.*
zefrank1: But first, a message from our sponsor- Me: *KING CRIMSON!*
8:32 these mosquitos are engaged in a life or death duel while walking on water...."NARUTTTOOOO!!! SASUKKKKEEEEE!!"
Adult males hovering around waiting to pounce on the female the very moment she hits legal age.
"BOOB!"....ahh sad ghost.
Ah yes. The mos-ko-wee-toes
Thank you ze frank. That was...... "Brilliant".
Always delighted to see you!
I'm suprised you didn't teach about how to make tgem explodecwhen they bite you ;p
Wtf!! The commentary is hilarious! I didn’t think it was possible to learn and laugh at the same time
The narration is superb !
I love this video
Anyone else get major catharsis from watching the mosquito larvae die???
i swear i was itchy during this whole video
Now the elephant mosquito is my kind of mosquito need more of them in the world.
of all unlucky animals, i killed mostly mosquitoes, these beasts are so gross, i killed around 9 of them last week.
Little magnificent spawns of satan
Aww fuck I have that thing where lots of little holes freak me out 🤢🤮
Always good to see more true facts.  I still want to kill all mosquitoes though.  My blood is MINE and they have NO CLAIM to it.
how have we not invented a way to exterminate these annoying shit insects.
I love how he says babies
I almost imagine that one mosquito Frank kept saying "Hellooo!" to as being appropriate for a dub of Michigan J. Frog singing, "Hello my baby! Hello my honey! Hello my ragtime gaaaallllll!!" lol
my entire body itched for the entire duration of the video.
YESSSS!! a True Facts video....!!!
We need a playlist of ZeFrank's music. I'm still hung up on Ostrich and Puffin Muffin, and now this masterpiece... Mosquito says Hello!
So... there are good mosquitoes. Dang.
Ew
Where’s jerry! Did he get fired?
Omg your entire channel is my humor I love it
I felt itchy just watching this video
amazing!
God it's nearly winter, all the mosquitos are gone but I'm watching this at 3 am and now I can't shake the feeling of bugs off me x_x I am DECEASED!
All of that just so they can annoy the hell out of you for 4 months.  Ugh, just seeing images of those things flying around makes me itch. We have a special relationship with mosquitos here in Georgia.
We all missed you man
I could imagine alien zefrank1 that is making documents on Humans in this video style
DAMMIT, I didn't know they were pollinators... Turns out they DO have a purpose...
I feel bad for killing all those elephant mosquitoes
I hate so much about this. I hate that the larva stage looks like a game of Spore, I hate that they leave the water like Papa Emeritus coming on stage, I hate that the sheath crumples like a McDonald's straw wrapper, I hate that the proboscis is prehensile, I hate that there's an entire species of barely-legal-stalking creeps, and I hate that these parasites have an ecological niche.
at this point i would love them elephant mosquitos around where im at
Buzzy buzzy
I miss this
probably the only situation it is a victimless crime is to teach by whatever means necessary. The best teachers know how to get a person to comprehend and retain information. Thank you senpai zefrank.
do a video on shoebills!! :D
"It's mosquitoes all the way down..." Well there's a twist on Terry Pratchett that I'd never thought I'd hear...
That was a good song 10/10
thanks for the warning with the holes...When i was a kid a saw a documentary about amazon frogs and had nightmares for months...ergo trypophobia
If I remember correctly, female elephant mosquitos don't suck blood as adults because they've already got the energy they need for egg production from snacking on other larvae in their larval stage.
You know, I always wondered what the males ate. Very cool.
Have followed for a while now..this may be my favorite mix of laughs and education yet. Thank you
Replace all mosquitoes with elephant mosquitoes
6:41  Haha, nice one
True facts about mosquitos...THEY SUCK!
This was beautiful, mosquitoes are so interesting and unique, I never knew they were like that.
10/10 would listen to zefrank say 'bebehs' again.
I like that the Morgan freeman voice has gone and its now all Ze Frank, all the time. With a bit of Jerry.
I love this guy! 🤣
Elephant ones and the one with purple and blue with black leg-warmers can stay but the rest I sincerely wish they could be transported to the surface of the sun
that connect to the rrrrrrrrrroof
I know mosquitos are vital to the ecology but as a person allergic to these little things I say their extermination is worth it.
I dont like or comment almost anything on youtube. But about when the sponsor was being read I came across a problem. Youtube only lets you like a video once. So i just wanted to let you know great job and if I could have I would have liked the video 4x. Keep up the good work.
I feel as if this is the perfect way for my goofy ass to learn shit easily
Friendly reminder that although only a few species of mosquitoes bite humans, the chemicals used to kill them don't distinguish between species, and in some cases harm other insects like butterflies and bees. That's why the mosquito genetic engineering projects are such a big deal and we can't just rely on sprays.
That butt first never gets old 🤣🤣
Can we get a release of that mosquito song?
Fun Trivia: The mosquito has killed more humans than every war in human history combined.
These always make my day.
Every mosquito should've been the elephant mosquito
He probably the best story teller in whole world.
Goddammit Jerry
this is cool and all, butt fuck musqātous. oh, shit. Jerry, fix that in post will ya? khm khm, so females in the genus trakawfkawi2s stay with their eggs and guard them.
ZeFrank...sooo love all your videos🤣🤣 Cannot wait for the next one. Til then i shall just rewatch many many others🤣🤣
Suddenly, I have this urge to get my bug spray out and spray the TV! 🤣🤣🤣
“It’s mosquitos all the way down” John!
The white Morgan Freeman
Ædes egipti = dengue
Gz on being on trending
What happened to Jerry???
EWWWWWW
Clams are stupid - there I said it
Fun Fact: The mosquito in John Hammond's cane is an elephant mosquito.
This video made me itchy.
That bug at 2:02 took an absolute MONSTER of dump like damn
Johnston's organ 🤣🤣🤣
The white version of Morgan Freeman🤣
So why are we not just dumping cannibal mosquitoes everywhere all the time? I'm just asking for future reference.
Loved the mosquito song!   Make an album!
A collab we need: zefrank1 and casual geographic
This video made me unbelievably itchy
sooo, does anyone know, if you have a high alcohol or drug content when she sucks your blood does that mean the babies are high?  WOW!  no wonder there are so many killin' each other and eatin' each other.  They all probably have hangovers!  scary stuff there!
So basically baby mosquitoes begin life as sentient blackheads?
I have just been recomanded this. The intelektualness im felling right now is exquisit.
Love it and love the song !
demon babbies   and people are good at killing people . true words
This is the first time I actually read the credits after one  of your videos.  I just want to say I have always loved ALL of your videos, and watch them several times over, but this time I earned so much more respect for how much work you put into each of these.  I'm sorry for all those hundreds of times I said (under my breath) 'C'mon dude,! why can't you do more of these more often?  They are so entertaining and educational !' For that I am truly sorry.  I now understand you are not just a mouth piece reading a script.  And I await your next one most graciously.  Respectfully.  Amber Hardin
im dead looool
Bored as fuck down the YouTube rabbit hole 12:10am not disappointed your commentary made my night
That was fun and very educational,  too bad school can't be like that. I learned more about sketoes in 17 minutes than I have in my entire life,  and I'm old enough to know better.
these videos are my coping mechanism
Brilliant!!!!!
wait, there's a good mosquito out there?!  I feel my brain has frozen from disbelief....
So now I have to pay child support for mosquitoes
This was FACINATING thank you!!
Dammit, zeFrank. The last creature I wanna be fascinated by is the mosquito, but, dammit, you did it.
Thank you internet. The journey is self fulfilling...
Muscling through my hate of mosquitoes to watch this😤
Anyone else get itchy from just watching this? If not yeah me neither, that’s just weird
Good lord I have a great distaste for mosquitos. Well B-suckers.
My only complaint about this series is that I've already watched every single ONE of the others and it takes SO long for a new one. 😂 This channel is absolutely hilarious AF can't wait for the next one, and please tell Jerry I said what's up!
I still think all human biting ones need to die.
Slapping two mosquitoes mating in the air is Satisfying. As. Fuck.
Now that I've learned about mosquitoes.... I HATE THEM EVEN MORE
Anyone else itchy throughout this video?
I bet they can smell the sugar in my sweat
Mosquitos are the bane of my existence
Here come the bebehs! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
who is the narrator ?
Zefrank is back, baby
12:03 I can't stop laughing over the "inside view of a teddybear being humped by a chihuahua" bit!  It's so true!
lets go
I remember as a kid in elementary school I there was a poster that read:  "Even a mosquito gets a pat on the back for a job well done."
Mosquitos, absolute nightmare fuel.
who on earth is disliking this?
I was outside in the dark having a smoke with the light on my phone. As the mosquito mating montage was played this large mosquito flew up right beside my finger into the light beam! 😱 startled the heck outta me!
"That's how Lady Gaga would come out on stage" TOTALLY!!!
Dunno if this is a dumb question, or if indeed anyone can answer this, but:  If a female mosquito uses human blood to make her eggs and not just to sustain herself, does that mean baby mosquitos contain human DNA? I mean, he specifically said 'uses human blood to make her eggs'.
I feel simultaneously informed and repulsed.
Nobody: No one at all: Not a single living soul: Ze Frank:  Dicked by a skeeter
When you are trying to sleep and there is that one "invisible" mosquito buzzing around,  Turn an electric fan on.  It does not have to face you.  It will stir up the air currents, and make it very hard for the mozzie to fly and to find you.             love from Victoria Australia  This part of Australia gets four seasons.  In spring now, wind/heat/cold/frost/hail/sunshine/wind wind wind. Did I mention turbulent weather and lots of wind?  I giggled ( long time since, i needed that)  and I learnt some stuff.
please true facts about humans
Now I’m super impressed ! I really like mosquitoes now, except the part where I’m bitten 😂
3:07 is a waterbug
The but first joke never gets old 🤣
Bill gates want eliminate these. Do you trust him?
Lost it at moskoweeto 🤣
This is BS.
ze frank you’re a legendary youtuber. could you possibly put genus/species names on the screen when you’re showing the footage? it would be super helpful! :)
This has to be my favorite thing to watch! ZeFrank rocks! Can't wait for the next one!
I like how in the old videos he tired to sound more like Morgan freeman and over the years it’s more like a very subtle Morgan freeman
I'm fallen in love with your mosquito song! Please, make whole song. I need more. For last 30 minutes I'm stuck listening it.
Dale I'm not drunk it's just wtf... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fun Fact: you can explode a mosquito by flexing. say if you have a mosquito on your thigh and you were to flex your thigh when it is taking blood from it if you flex it long enough they cant pull out and will keep getting blood until they die
I hate all mosquitos... Except the big ones, they're alright.
"Beautiful life"
finally.   i needed this.
I remember referencing the duck video regularly with my friends during our freshman year in high school... I'm now grad school and this series is finally back and going strong :')
Mos kuwi toes~
Zefrank supremacy is the only dogma I believe in.
If a mosquito didn’t have the itchy stuff, I wouldn’t care if they bit me
the way he says "baby" amuses me lol
so good...informative yet entertaining af
I watched this whole thing just trying to find out how long it takes the eggs to hatch, the lifespan of different mosquito, if the egg can survive in oily or disinfected water, etc. but I guess the sex  and poop jokes took up that spot ☹️ ☹️ ☹️
Absolute number 1 ever. You are doing great stuff and we love you :)
I miss the "Imagine... that is how the ____ do" joke. :(
Keep doing you homie
I can never not watch one of your videos, entertaining as heck and educational 😊
Holy shit, this is hilarious and horrifying...
Since the convict has been tackled. Now I want to see True Facts about Earthworms.
I don't understand how this delightful bundle of butt jokes went and became the most well-researched and high-production-value science series on YouTube, but I am not complaining
Ah yes the mosquito, Manitoba's provincial bird
will never not laugh at “Butt first, sorry, but first”
Holy shit hes back
Bro I can learn like this all day lmbo 😂😂😂
So you are telling me that mosquitos are chinese vampires, we attract them by breathing exponentially
JFC Z...so fucking good. And kudos to all the photographers...including Bentdick Player. Oh, my apologies...that's Benedikt Plower...Pleyer. Congrats to everyone!
Anyone else sad he didn't say "sucky sucky?"
As a resident of a country with rampant malaria and dengue I'm highly interested in this video
This makes me hate mosquitoes more! ☹️ Like, why are they built so complicated?! 😭
~hel-LOOO~
No matter how elegantly you narrate it, seeing these creatures makes me irrationally angry.
its like a horror show
Idk if that warning was meant to be a joke but thank you man!
This video made my day! :)
little egg bomb
Beautiful!  Thank you.
At 10:40, youre telling me mosquitos have evolved to know which part of our body is CLOTHING...?
This was such a gift.
moz que y tos
What happened to jerry!?
I liked the video before pressing play and my prediction was correct, your video are... awesome!
So here's a question, my Mom and I went to Caddo Lake recently, I didn't get bitten once by anything and she was eaten alive? Are there Mosquitos that prefer Chinese food? Follow up question, What would happen if we killed all mosquitos that fed on humans?
Its all good knowledge. How do we kill them though?
Me and my lil blood stains are watching this closely
Pretty sure this is the best Channel on YouTube.  And as much as I would love for there to be a lot more frequent posts, the attention to detail and the work that is  put into each one, makes them well more than worth the wait.
Yeah, those are water bugs. Nasty buggers. They bite right through pants too, the a-holes. They swim AND fly, and they WILL fly straight to your face. Huge nope.
He returns!
d e m o n b a b y
Frank's a pupa specialist!
heLLO
Thank you franky for not using jerry's easy, egotistic jokes towards mosquitos and even shaming him for it
Not all bugs can shoot lasers like the spider from webbed
Every single time, I think I'll be ready for the "butt-first" gag.  Every single time, I'm wrong.  But I'll never be as wrong about it as I was this time.
my chronic tick born illness makes me HATE disease carrying insects
I like that elephant mosquito.   Freaking Aedes aegypti where I'm from carries Dengue, Chikungunya, Zika.  Not fun viruses.  Wish I could emit some sort of toxin that kills mosquitoes that get too close.   Anyway, good video as usual.
You are the best human on the internet
The depressed ghost is the funniest thing I've heard all week
I was laying down watching this, and for 5 minutes I didn't realize that my phone was upside down. 5 minutes...
We always called these big bugs "mosquito eaters" which they probably weren't, but I see from the elephant mosquito that it was based on a real thing.
Wow great footage and research here
# 12 on trending *Noice*
The mandible thing on clear bugs is mental
Learning about how the mosquitoes who bite us work proves my theory that they serve no purpose except to harass humans Elephant mosquitoes are okay though
DEMON BABY 2:11 !!!! loll The adult humor is perfect !
"If you have that thing where holes freak you out, now might be a good time to go to the kitchen" that warning really should have been a few seconds sooner, but I appreciate it
"This video is sponsored by brilliant, Learn to think."  Am i the only one who was taken a back by that?

This episode made me soooooooo itchy 😬
"DEMON BEHBEH"  - confucius, 2021
what a bunch of blood suckers
I swear I hope these videos never end. Zefrank is a gift to this world.
"it looks like a snufflopagus reimagined as a dildo wearing glasses."  I. S. T. G. THIS. MAN.
That opening shot had me scrambling backwards in unmitigated horror. It would make a good monster in a monster movie!  Awesome video once again! Thank you very much it was, as always, highly informative. But I think I will continue to hate the little buggers 😍
Surah al-Baqarah 26. Allah does not shy away from presenting a parable of a mosquito or something above it. As for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, “What did Allah mean by this parable?” He misleads many by it, and He guides many by it, but He misleads none but the wrongdoers.
MO-SQUEETOS.
it still irks me that mosquitos are important part of ecosystems. I guess Ill have to ally with the cannibal mosquitos
verrrry interessssting!  but on the whole - yuck!!!!!    <<://9(€<
I killed a mosquito today. I don't regret it...
“It’s an annoying sonuva that Satan created for fun” that’s it, that’s the mosquito in a nutshell
Fun Fact: I'm slightly allergic to their saliva, so instead of shutting down nerves to hide them it has the exact opposite effect where it actually puts my body on high alert and starts screaming at me where the Mosquito is. Also the bump that breaks out is about twice as large as what's normal.
Lets not forget that we now have an actual vaccine for Malaria. Perfect timing for a Mosquito video.
"That's why you don't ask what somethings good for jerry, you get a sulky chicken." This is now one of my favorite quotes
I love this channel so much (helLO!)!
i put a small goby on an mosquito larvae infested puddle,,,after 3days the Goby look fat & the larvaes are gone
Can we at least kill all of the Aedes Aegypti?
This just made me want to introduce elephant mosquitos.
Ohhh sooo that’s the truth about these blood stealing thieves
I love you so much!! Thank you!
Hands down the best nature show. Informational and hilarious. You need to be picked up or at least sponsored by a tv station.
HEEEELLLLLOOOOOOO!!!
Wtf 😂 0:24
Is there anywhere that explains why you pronounce "baby" the way you do? lol
Brilliantly written! And now I know at least one type of mosquito I DON’T hate. 💆🏾‍♀️
@11:08 it looks like the mosquito is wearing sunglasses. Im a little disappointed you didnt mention it. LOL
9:09 "Dic'ed by a sketter" lol, poor earbud.
Remake the cuttlefish video please and thanks 🙏🏽
Brilliant as usual and quite timely here in the Sonoran desert this summer! Lots of rain and...and just have made thousands of little BehBehs! Went for years with nary a bite and now.... I know how chocolate cake feels around a fat kid!
My daughter is very allergic to mosquitoes.
Thanks! I hate it.
I need to know if pool-related "indecent exposure" arrests spike over the next few weeks. If so, it is undoubtedly because of this video
Mosquito says "Hello"
Seeing their mouth parts split inside you makes me even more grossed out by them
filter tiny craplets into their mouths
I remember when I realized mosquitos started life in water...there were potted plants all over the porch and i spent a Lot of time in the porch swing drawing and writing...and it had rained and gotten super humid and hot outside.  my cat was really interested in one of the pots..which had a plate under it with water standing in it.. I got up and looked...all these little SEA MONKEY looking wiggly things in there..I didnt know what they were..but knew they were some sort of larvae mode..so I paid attention and in a few days they started coming up and attaching to the lip of the plate and I dipped a twig in and one stuck to it..it was def a depressed ghost looking thing but so small..and I saw one come out and flex and realized it was a micro sized mosquito and I remember feeling kinda like I had witnessed something that most people never notice... lmao
Today I learned that the reason why this mosquito won't leave me alone and will always find me us because of it's feet fetish and that the larvae she will eject at a high velocity is technically my offspring and probably the only offspring I will have
Unironically very impressed by that song, damn
Hey Z you should do a collab with Hood Nature. You two would make a legendary video!!
I'm Thankful for minds and voices like zefrank,   thank you sir, your videos are smart and hilarious..my fav combo
Dale??? What'd you do to Jerry, you S.O.B.???
Yep, you caught me with my head in the gutter!! Liked the longer show!
Let’s Go Brandon!
I have never laughed this much watching your videos, this episode is really something! XD
I feel like hes trying to convince me thatu mosquitos aren't all bad 🤔🤣
There's so much going on for something that causes Dengue fever
I never thought there were mosquitoes I wouldn't hate.
You could probably do a funny video on sand fleas. Litterly just found out there a thing.
Im so goddamn happy there is more
Hate them squitoes
Lmao best fucking educational channel on YouTube... Facts baby
Who else had a mosquito in their room while watching this? 🤬😤💀
Mosquito butt....hahaha. yup, My kid escaped again.
Elephant mosquitoes are the GOATS of all mosquitoes
I never get tired of hearing how Zefrank pronounces "babies"
Literally had 0 idea mosquitos we're pollinators! LEARNING! Also, amazing video and love this series!
00:31: I'm like who the eff is Dale, and what happened to Jerry? The suspense is killing me... must dive back in to find out. 8:24: Phew, there he is. Jerry lives.
I still can't believe that mosquitos are the fastest insect on the planet
Hands down your best work. And I don't say that lightly or from the hype of something new. Incredible work all around.
When is the zefrank greatest hits album coming out? Puffin dance, mosquito song, koalas in the rain...
17 minutes about mosquitos AND you're narrating. Best day ever  Sincerely a science nerd
"...and now it's getting dicked by a skeeter."  I'm absolutely using this to express when things go from bad to worse.
When is your album going to drop?
The way he says, Babies.... Cracks me up every time. Bay-beeeez  🤣
You know how you know zefrank has mastered his videos?  You are excited to hear him do a commercial for Brilliant.   I do not think I have ever clicked past a commercial he has done
Mosquitos in CT are known to carry EEE, which is not curable. 30% will die. Out of those that survive,  almost half will not be permanently disabled. CT recommends people use repellents, dress accordingly, and avoid dawn and dusk.
Really disgusting from birth to death.
I still strongly dislike mosquitoes.  They are creepy and gross.  But the pollination thing is cool.
"HELLLOOOOOO!"
Yea I couldn't watch that first part
3:02😳🤢😜
All this leads to being squashed 5 minutes later
Me: mosquito “hell-no.” Ze Frank: mosquito “neat-oh!”
And now I finally know why so many mosquitos bite my legs and ankles.
THEY ALL DESERVE DEATH
Shock it with Chlorine
Hey, you still alive? We forgot you exist............ Did you come back??
This video made me genuinely interested yet disgusted at the same time
Person: how do you want to do this? Zefrank1: Butt first
I'm gonna try that mosquitoe earbud trick.
*look at all those mosquito bebes*
Bruh where can I see more footage like this?? Idk what it is but a good example is 3:07 like that footage is just amazing
Ze Frank: "It looks like Snuffleupagus but reimagined as a dildo" Me: "That's kinda how Snuffleupagus looked in his first episode. Tell Jerry to look it up and he'll recoil in fear, Snuffy's original appearance was that disturbing."
Elephant mosquito be like  💫Hellooooo💫
Interesting I had no idea that some mosquitoes live on pollins from flowers 🌷🌷. I always thought they live on our blood
First video and I'm already laughing I'm definitely liking and subscribe
Butt-first.   ...sorry,  "but, first"
I always saw mosquitos as tiny hyperdermic needles with wings, this right here taught me a lot about those little S.O.Bs
Gustavos brother
I was waiting for him to call them mosquweetos and I got even more than I bargained for. Moscow eatos. As always you go above and beyond.
Who else was bitten today? Also Why do some buzz and some do not?
Fun fact:     *THEY SUCK!!!*
I absolutely hate these things! Because I have type O- blood all the mosquitoes jump on me like an all you can eat buffet! 😖😬
Been waiting an eon for a new video!
Mozzies are elegant things. Like a Bf109, you don't want to be on the business end but there's a grudging admiration of the sheer form of the thing.
this episode is so fascinating! wow, mosquito got my respect!
All the mosquitos in the world can be torched by my flamethrower 😂
god that first clip is like watching an alien during sleep paralysis
*oho, now its these fuckers time to "shine"*
I say H No to mosquitoes.
Hell- OHHH
This series is one of the greatest collection of media on the internet
the absolute power move of surrounding your sponsored segment with bug breeding.
that entrance reminds me of when dracula wakes up from sleeping in his coffin (floating up while crossing his arms)
Now I'm itchy
Sponser of this video:I mean... its...educational ZeFrank: named after Johnson, who must have had very small organ
Hey u'r back👏👏👏
This is the only YouTube creator I can be assured I’ll laugh out loud - deeply and often to the point of tears. I must have a juvenile sense of humor. Thanks for the excellent content and long time no hear!
I actually have that thing where lots of little holes freak me out called Trypophobia.  I'm glad he warned me first eeeek! 👍
Amazing video💕😍🌸
Good nightmare material.
Thank you for the phobia warning!
I thought I'd learn to appreciate mosquitos' existence through learning about them, but somehow the more I learn about them, the more I want them to die off.
Best opening ever!
Mosquito says hello, I say HELL NAW!
While watching this I was attacked by a mosquito XD irony
Hm. That one web comic about the fedora wearing mosquito going for the sleeping woman's feet makes more sense now
Honestly Ze - would it kill you to do one of these things on something cute?  I bet there's lots of interesting and funny things about pandas.  Or otters!  They hold hands while sleeping!
Never has infanticide felt so right
This is just about the best script of all these videos.
I now have a favourite mosquito.    That was something I really wasn't expecting! Love ZeFrank ♡  Mosquito's can all just get over any foot fetish that includes MY feet btw. 😑
From the subtitles: "Jerry fix it it post would you? Females in the genus trigonometry.."
It's heeeereeeee!!! My favorite "new expressions séries"! I was getting sady-sady, but it's here! 🥰
I am so itchy now.
ＤＥＭＯＮ ＢＥＢＥＹ
5:28  NEVER
There is nothing beautiful about these spawn of Satan, take it from someone who been fighting them off since childhood, I always get cover in their bite marks
*sees stagnant water with baby mosquitoes* DUMP
First sentence already killed it 😂
pause right at 3:39 looks like a panda crazy!!!
Ok... seriously tho, this was so funny I watched it 3 times and still didnt learn anything.. my dad even laughed the whole time
Kill kill kill kill killl kill kill kill kill Hate mosquitoes Hate mosquitoes Hate mosquitoes Hate mosquitoes Hate mosquitoes Hate mosquitoes Hate mosquitoes Hate mosquitoes Hate mosquitoes
I'm curious to know how/why blood is needed to reproduce.
Can you do the hognose snake next? I love them.
2:11 😨
this video made me itchy
8:52 You know, surprisingly enough, I didn’t wake up this morning expecting to learn about mosquito statutory rape, but here we are.
so there is a chance i am a mother for of alot of mosquitos? damn
HE'S BACK!!!
Moscoweetoes.. that's great, you always have the greatest pronunciations And I dont care how many times I hear it.. behbehs 🤣 look at the behbehs 😭
The only problem I have with the videos is that there aren't enough if them 🤣
I like clapping mosquitoes out of the air , I get to feel like an anti air gun tearing down hordes of planes coming to cause me harm. There’s a lot where I work because of standing water.  there’s nothing like clapping one so hard , your hands ache and turn red , but you get to see that you pretty much turned the mosquito back into the building blocks of life .
Proven- best creator 🥇
I thought all mosquitos were the spawn of satan, but I can't believe ZeFrank found me a species of mosquito to love
I’ll tell my kids this was Natural Geographic
Here in Canada, in a secluded area, a small population of people consisting of myself and my wife call them moequitos...  moe-quee-toes
I just love you.
It's crazy to imagine that I've been watching these for almost a decade...
I know it would be even more work than what you already put into these videos, but it would be awesome to see a traveling nature show with Zefrank as the host. Love this content
love it
ew
No sucking joke? I'm kind of disappointed :P
What I have learned: 1. we can't kill all Mosquitoes because their pollinators.  2. Elephant Mosquitoes are best Mosquitoes and we need more of them. 3. we are Mosquito [insert food you hate the most] but they STILL. FUCKING. EAT US! 4. Mosquito have to deal with Mosquito Mosquitoes. 5. Mosquito are shit at sucking blood.
That “butt first” DESTROYED me
I'm sorry zefrank, I love you but I still hate mosquitoes
Thank you for all the time & effort you obviously put into each of your videos! I love getting to laugh while learning
It's amazing how he can make "butt" and "but" sound so different yet so similar
Amazing. Now go extinct thank you. Edit: Okay, elephant mosquito can live.
The legend returns
I was genuinely interested with a grin on my face while drinking my tea. Then the elephant variety came out and said hello. I spat out my tea.
The way you sneak one last butt joke on the lead into the sponsor segment is pure brilliance.
liked for algorithm
Who TF is Dale?!
I think the end ruined rice for me XD
I gotta say, I love how this series that started as a joking documentary series has turned into a legit series that uses facts backed by actual scientists. It's still hilarious, but now I'm learning. Damn you Ze Frank!!! I was coerced into learning! You'll be hearing from my lawyer.
I fucking love this guy 😂😂
PLANT . SPERM... I can't even 🤣🤣🤣
Ugh I love ur videos but I am absolutely disgusted!!
I now love mosquitos and that makes me feel like a traitor to humanity
my new favourite YouTuber.
That babeh dead babeh.
They eat it butt first....but first!: Goes to ad. (Me: Dead)
hello dale
Stop making me like them I shant! I wont!
Mosquitos are pollinators???? Some species consume nectar exclusively??? How am I only now finding this out??? I mean, I still hate the little bitey-boys (actually, bitey-girls) but at least I no longer curse their existence in its entirety… Thanks Ze Frank for the public service announcement!
The inside view of a teddybear humped by a chihuahua... LOL
All I need; talking mosquitoes.
Just watched this and everything is itching... with KNOWLEDGE!
That little theme song almost made me not want to kill the buggers.
Anyone ever notice how mosquito bites hurt more than they use to? Like they use to not hurt at all or be felt now they actually hurt and shit...
Are we not gonna talk about how at 2:00 it just takes a shit right next to him?
This is perhaps the most viscerally disturbing video in this series
We can’t have salty chickens!
I work for a county mosquito abatement department. This will have to be on the "must watch list" for the new kids.
A neat little fact for everyone. There is a common plant that can help ward of mosquitos. It has three smooth almond shaped leaves. If you find it rub it on open skin for a whole day bug free. Its called Toxicodendrio Radicans. Your welcome.
burn them all
I think thus is a blessing that this video was the first thing I saw this morning; not my dog, not my computer, not even my toilet. Nope! This brilliant hilarious video!! 😂
Most amazing youtube content of all times...love you zefrank
Even if some of them are cool, i still want to kill them all with fire
—Watching baby mosquitos get eaten by literally anything else— “Yes they deserve to die and i hope the burn in hell”
I'm three minutes in and have to pause because I'm laughing so hard!😂
Real talk, if the little monsters didn't spread diseases ever, like magically they just stopped, I'd be chill with em. Just don't give me the malaria and you could snack on my paralyzed leggies!
Holy crap! 17 minutes!? This is gonna be good
Minus the elephant mosquito, they can all die in a fire.
Hahahaha thanks
Why couldn't these mfs just stay in the water
3:08 I think that's a water scorpion.... but I'm not an insectologist.
🤣 I so needed this today!  Those little bastards will pick me over a whole crowd of people and I got bit twice this evening and it took a while to stop itching from the bites.  But somehow Zefranks' video of these little blood thieving bastards made it all worth while.
Yet another interesting, informative and funny video maintaining the True Facts standard! Well done!
Truly beautiful Horrendously annoying
This made me so happy
"mosquitos are pollinators." Nothing horrifies me any more than the idea of relying on mosquitos to survive if bees go extinct
Needed that holes trigger warning another 10 seconds earlier.. :v
Im from South Louisiana and the mosquitoes here are so horrible and some get about the size of a quarter! Its miserable
True Fact: I am horrified and amused.
The little bastard that should not exist
I have only one complaint, it's that I have so much fun watching your videos that even a 17 minute one still feels like only 2 minutes!
That last mosquitos butt was like a programmed sorter. Push out, press in, shift right, repeat.
Great video.
Only ZeFrank could make me think twice before zapping one of these mfs with an electric tennis racket  Specially knowing some of them are totally harmless
Here come the behbehs!
Leave my organ out of this....
All the things I didn't know about Satan's Folly, thank you , now I can tell my friends !
Now that you mentioned it: My gf knows I'm eating on the toilet again when she hears my Elton John impression throughout the building...you know... "...IN THE CIRCLE.......THE CIRCLE OF LIFE"
Omfg I love this guy
I love the intro to this video. Made me spit my food out
God I love this channel
Hahahahaha demon baby
fabolous video
I am belly laughing on my couch 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Oh, thank you thank you. I have needed your laugh.
10:50 considering after watching this I found a mosquito bite on my foot.... This is apparently very true.
I got bit by these blood suckers today
Love Zfrank videos! Wife and I watch them as soon as they hit.
2021, our brain-dead scientific 'experts' claiming to be studying how to turn mosquitoes against each other when nature already has the elephant mosquito.  Is everything in the medical community a lie? Long answer: Yes. Huge shout out and thanks to virologists for creating mosquito-borne viruses. Dengue Virus, Chikungunya Virus, Zika Virus, and the West Nile Virus. The world now knows that viruses aren't living things.  F*ck every single one of you virologists out there.
Mosquitoes prefer my blood.
Useless fact The elephant mosquito was the species shown in Jurassic Park ; the DNA extraction scene and also the big mozzie in Hammond's knob ( on his cane). Ironic since the species is a nectivore and would not have any blood ( dino or otherwise) in it's system. It was also a male mosquito. The mosquito specimens were sourced from the Public Health Entomology Research and Education Center in Panama City, which received a $50 donation for their services. Hammond's cane ( with the mosquito knob) was late sold for $32,000.
Brilliant stuff!  Just loved the heLLO!
Aedes Aegypti are monsters.
Mosquitos use our blood to kay eggs. That means they're also our children /j
I know there's nothing on me but I'm so itchy watching this
Chihuahua.. 🤣
Fantastic
Funny and informative 😂🤣🤣🤣
I stan elephant mosquito
To Hell with mosquitoes!!!
I did not fully understand what it meant to be "squicky" until I watched this video
Thank you, Zefrank for once again making me chortle!
Pardon, me, but does anyone know how to breed elephant mosquitos? Just curious.
Now you've done it. I didn't want to know that mosquitos drink nectar and pollinate the pretty flowers! Now I can't continue to hate all mosquitos with the utmost hatred of which I am capable. Now I can only hate individual mosquitos, and only when I actually catch them feasting on me. "I used to be an insect bigot. Then Zefrank let the sunshine into my heart." Thanks a lot, Dude.
Mosquito:exists Me: BURN THAT GAGGLE FUCK!!
I was very surprised by the "Club Kids" reference.
Narader:Look at this one is filfy it has plant sperm all over it 6:06 Me:🤣🤣🤣
Mosquitoes are interesting creatures, especially how they stand with 4 legs and hold the back two in the air like antannae when resting.
We neeeed david attenborough to watch and comment!!
Pleakley: Fascinating
Oh was waiting for those bloodsuckers
1:36 😂😂😂hat part had me dying. Zefrank1, I don't know where you get such humor, but you are a comedy genius!
I hate mosquitoes. They leave itchy bite marks.
<3
Boob..🤣🤣
I hate mosquitoes. I am allergic. But I still respect the fabulousness of the one that says, “Hel-LOOOOO!”
Educational and funny at the same time - what's not to like!
You are such an incredibly talented human - of the species - homo erectus. Brilliant! Bravo.
So basically they're butterflies that come from the water?
TIL mosquitos are pollinators
Between this and the tick episode, I think he's in the pocket of Big Blood-Sucking Parasite.
Here to detroy u with fax n lojik  bumper car pole thing connects to the CEILING not the ROOF  0/10 unsubbed reported as spam
0:55 made me look away 😰🤢 otherwise, good vid!
A mosquito feeding on another mosquito is like when the characters of a heist movie get robbed by someone else right after being done with the job
Anyone else getting itchy?
Yes! Best part of my day is seeing you pop up my feed!!!!
This is the most I've ever learned from a single 17 minute long youtube video. Thanks zefrank!!
Possibly the perfect YouTube video. Educational, funny, and states the sources on screen.
"If she hear what she likes" very clever twist of words... too clever...
oh my god this video made me itch everywhere
Dude dear God thank you for the warning😨 them holes nearly gave me hives
mosquito eggs look straight outta alien
I've always wondered what ecological benefits mosquitoes provide if the world ever decides to hunt these bloodsuckers to extinction. Too many hot summers and cold itchy rainy nights ruined by these flying needles.
You had me at Demon Bebe
Cool video. The script is obnoxious.
We all know that the mosquito can fly but the fly cannot mosquito
please murder at the very least all the human bloodsuckers. For all that work the saliva does to keep the mosquito hidden you would think they would make it so the bites aren't such a nuisance afterwards. But no, the little bastards can't help but cause a little mild suffering.
The mosquito is simply Dracula rising from his coffin
00:35 pressing on my nose be like    *vomit
Damn. I haven’t seen his vids in years. The mantis fish is the last one I recall.
Demon baby. I’m dead 😂
This is like National Geographic on marijuana.
This guy needs a contract to national geographic or something... its f-ing great 👍
R/hmmm
TY for a mosquito enlightenment. [They gobble me up] You and your channel are fantastic! Oh, I should have said brilliant! ok, i just did! You're both- brilliantly fantastic
I think this is my favorite YouTube channel EVER. I nearly wet myself when the mosquito came out "He'll-O-o!"
i love the change of tone when the jokes gets even him
Hellllllloooo
Mosquitos also get mosquito, god has a sense of humor and will dunk on everyone.
We wish it wasn't so long between episodes......but you NEVER disappoint. (Less time before next episode..PLEASE)
oh boy it sure is amazing being in the air for the first time :D  oh hey it's gettin dark quite quickly :D
am i the only one who also scratched my arms and legs despite no mosquito bites.
ELEPHANT MOSQUITOS MUST BE PROTECTED AT ALL COSTS
I swear this series has kept me going since middle school.
There are so many quotable moments in your videos.  You should use some clips to make YouTube stories!  I've seen other people posting shorts of your content and getting hella views.. you are so under-rated, we need to get you more exposure!
Reminds me when I was a kid and I'd be swimming out in the backyard, mosquitos would hover over the pool, and I'd try to knock them outta the sky with water. Water. *The thing they're born from.*
Learned a lot thank you!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
DEMON BABY
*D E M O N B E H B E H*
I wonder if you still watch these like we used to.
All this life has been living and evolving for millions of years and that's why any extinction caused by us is an unacceptable desaster
I’m sitting here itching my foot like mad, one of those feet smelling bastards got me!
13:33 I turned up from the drawing I was making, appalled. I had never thought about this.
You know, with the fairly stringent scientific bibliography and attributations, I have to wonder if anyone's used one of these videos in a scientific paper?
Thank you Ze! So needed this today! Adore the Mosquito song too.
that's it, im getting the flamethrower
I love his Ted talks
i love you zefrank and i appreciate your dedication to education but i'm still gonna smash these fuckers the moment i see em
I just checked ur channel yesterday to make sure i hadnt missed an upload.
From the second I saw the thumbnail, I had an _itch_ to watch.
What da dog doin’?
hellOO!
Wait.. have mosquitoes really killed more humans that... humans have?? I find that hard to believe, but if it's true my hate for the lil fuckers seems much more justified !!
For god's sake, i just woke up.
5:40 it also allows them to be hard as fuck to catch
#15 on Trending - Bravo of putting something beneficial in amongst the horrible rap videos snuffing out people and the Minecraft videos.
Sooooooo interesting once again! I hate mosquitos but your show is just soooooooo hilarious and informal
THANK YOU SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH for another fantastic video!  Every time I see a new one, it's like the very best and most wonderful gift!!  🤪
His voice sound serious but he got jokes
This narrator is the best
ZeFrank!! We love your content!
challenge accepted
Oh man, when I saw this I couldn't wait.
This was the most entertaining thing I have seen in days!
my hole body itched during this entire episode. Is there a word for that? I think there must be a word for that.
Worst episode by far, not because it lacks quality but because mosquitoes have a habit of getting under my skin
Comment for the algorithm because I want MOAR
Music at the end had become my favorite part. The turtle one will always be the best tho
H E L L O  ! ! !
I wish I had a long siphon...
So my thoughts of "kill all these damned mosquitoes, i hate getting bit!" Is actually wishing for mass extinction...respect.  I shall now treat them, just like the bees.
This video made my skin itchy.
Didn't know a YT video could bring me so much joy.
i appreciate that zefrank often covers less popular types of animals, because someone has to. im sure the mosquitos would appreciate it too if they could
That Johnston organ joke had me dying, it sounded like Zefrank1 told me to grow up since I was already laughing at the joke haha awesome video
Mosquitos, my most hated insect next to wasps and second only to bed bugs. They probably help the environment in some way but I wouldn't mind killing all of them with 🔥.
Id be fine with mosquitoes taking my blood if they didnt have itch causing saliva and the occational malaria, im looking at you Anopheles. And fuck you for the Dengue virus you gave me a couple of years ago, Aedes aegypti.
Jerry? Jerry? Jerry!!!!!. get my flamethrower now and get me a tiny mosquito shaped electric chair I’m gonna send these bloodsucking demons to hell 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈💀💀
Always funny and informative lol
When you were talking about johnston's organ I started smiling a bit trying not to laugh, I lost it when you said grow up  right after (5:28)
The song at the end😳🔥
What does the elephant mosquito say?  *_HELLOOOOOOOOO_*
Bébés
When are you making a Spotify for these closing theme songs?
"Helloo!" XD
All those little holes at the start made my skin itch
An end song compilation might be a good idea one of these days
I still hate them.. except the Elephant ones... Hello!!!!!
I grew up learning that mosquitos could dodge rain drops in mid-air.  No idea if that's true, but it's cool if it is
And that's how the Zefrank do!
10:49 Anopheles Gambiae. Also known as Quentin Tarantino bug.
Thank you, im completely horrified now
This video made me very itchy.
The Jerry in zefrank's videos and the Jerry from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Nature_Calls_with_Helen_Mirren are the same Jerry.   Change my mind.
Dude.... I was eating
Thank-you
Learned a lot more on the toilet about mosquitoes than I thought I would
what I want to know is how the heck do they sneak up on your back or vulnerable body part when the fan is literally in front of you.
literally biting into a bagel when he said that lol
I just wanna smack an electric racket at it
We need some elephant mosquitoes in florida
Absolutely hilarious and I learned something too 👍 thank you
Jerry is the greatest side character I've never heard, seen, or known anything about.
So let me get this straight. There is a mosquito that  Eats baby mosquitos in the larval stage. Pops out of the water like a fucking mermaid, Doesn't eat peoples blood. And THEN fucking finds the MOFO that kills everyone and yeets its eggs around in the same soup to kill the bastards.  This thing is a national treasure. We need more.
The big bug you don’t know is a Giant Water Bug. Very, very nasty. And they bite peoples too. I should know. Got bit as a kid whilst catching frogs to feed my snake. And it hurt like heck! Stay out of the swamp!
It’s making me feel itchy
@vlogbrothers "mosquitoes all the way down"
True fact:  We missed you!
Wait who is Dale
0:31 Nah, see, those egg holes are perfectly spaced, symmetrically vertical and symmetrically diagonal. The only creep factor is that they are INSECT EGGS HATCHING. THE INSECT THAT'S BEST AT KILLING US. EDIT: Holy hell, the pain comes swiftly after.
Yaaayyy
The cadence of "roof" got me good
Meow
my gods you made a 17 mins video of my worst enemy. well. Here we go.
8:32 these mosquitos are engaged in a life or death duel while walking on water...."NARUTTTOOOO!!! SASUKKKKEEEEE!!"
Pour one out for Johnson
Love the "Mosquito" song! When's the album release!!! 🌼✌️😎
Return of the king!
Damn it. Now I'm itchy.
After watching zefrank since I was like 12 it makes me really happy to see him still doing really well on YouTube
They are even born like demons
Anyone else get itchy watching this?
Thank you Toxorhynchites
Baby mosquitos are a lot cuter than they have any right to be and I hate it
I still think we should mass extinct mosquitos you haven't changed my mind with this video.
I swear your channel is a gem to this world.
Bushy bushy, twisty twisty, bebe bebe, dead bebe.  This is better than Nat Geo and Discovery Channel together.
Crab hole creep... 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Snuffaleuffagus dildo  Ah god the trypophoia pain
Brilliant!
Yaaaaaaay zefrank 💃🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟
Zefrank... Please never change
The fact that mosquitoes also have to deal with even smaller mosquitoes makes me incredibly happy.
Petition to add “convulsive swimming” to the olympics. 😂
The life of a mosquito, Birth I squish it Death
Low key. ZeFrank just said don't shit where you eat.
"It's mosquitoes all the way down!" LOL! Love it :D
HELLOO!!   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I JUST LOVE IT.  It's your fault that now I just applied for biology career 💕
Just kill em all bro
Baybuhs.....
Zefrank doesn't upload often, but when he does, it's the best thing on YouTube ❤️👍✌️
0:39 Oh God I took the phone with me when I went to the kitchen.
I’ll now freak out even more knowing mosquitos do this bs
You've been the best since the Purina series but you're still a weirdo nutball. Yeah, it takes one to know one.......
This is the one I've been waiting for, thanks for doing the skeeters justice!
Wow you guys watched mozzies alot to find out all this interesting stuff!
WHERE'S JERRY!! My thoughts for the first 5 seconds
Lolololoooo🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Been watching these for years and im pretty sure i love em now more than ever! Please keep em coming!
yes! finally my Zefrank fix is had!!!
Finally when i thought zefrank is gone, he emerges  from his hibernation to give another video we can learn on. That is how zefrank do.
this video make me so uncomfortable i cant believe i watched the whole thing
This was hard to watch. But the classic humor this channel provides made me stick through.
I wish mosquitoes were extinct.
I don't care about your stupid eggs, chicken! 😂😂
This was ridiculous. Thank you for continuing this amazing series
I got itchy just watching this
I love your video's, but this one is making me sick! Oh no, there goes the spaghetti dinner!
Am I the only one getting itchy watching this?
When the world needed him most, he returned.
Awesome video ze Frank
They got butt snorkels!
“Man I should be doing homework rn” True facts: “Miskitos go brrrr brrr”
Sooo itchy now.
Bump
I was surprised how enjoyable this video was as someone who is afraid of mosquitos and larvae. Still don't like them but can appreciate some of what they do. Also those crazy led-filled eyes were kinda pretty.
10:56  Lmaoo I was holding my breath then I hear " so go ahead and hold your breath they'll find you anyways " and I just bursted laughing lmao,( Damn it thought it would work ) (I'm pretty stupid ik)
Why do I watch these all the time when I start eating fucking hell my appetite
Damn a new episode, didn’t expect that
A little friendly tip to repel the mosquiiiiatoess, eat plenty of garlic, onions, and chillies. Mosquiiiiatoess don’t dew garlic, onions, and chillies.
Y'know, I never knew that there were flowers that relief on mosquitoes. Thanks for that.
How to make your viewers itchy 101
I absolutly hate this… D o m a k e m o r e
I haven't laughed that hard in a long while... when he said that the mosquito looks like lady gaga emerging on stage, hahahaha.
I love this show!
Thank you for the video This inspires me even more to kill mosquitoes and keep my waters clean
Was there anyone else scratching themselves the entire time or was that just me?
I'll tell you something, growing up in a tropical country we are in constant war against mosquitoes and it shows. I've had dengue fever several times and I could tell which mosquito was the aedes aegypti just by the way it flew around
I love this guy
For those wondering what 3:11 is it's a giant water bug... yes that's its technical name.
I love your talks to the editor, it's so funny
This video is incredible!! Silly but so informative.
This video showed me that mosquitoes are actually pretty interesting and diverse, thanks.
Dang some of these ‘musky toes’ are cute.
DEMON BEBE
🤣 Fuck mosquitoes. Great vid.
Dale WHAT THE FU-  Famous last words
Thanks for the politics lesson
Thirty seconds in and I've already smashed the like button! 🤣
"Enemy predator missle inbound". - 14:42
"It's mosquitoes all the way down," is a horrifying concept
Remember, when a mosquito sucks your blood and lays eggs, you're 1/3 the father of the baby's..
Fun weird mosquito story: my little brother was diagnosed witb type 1 diabetes when he was 11. His body does not produce insulin. He does not get bit by mosquitoes anymore. He's almost 30 and hasn't been bit  in at least 15 years, which is something, because most of that time was spent in south Louisiana, so...the fucking tropics. We assume it's because his blood is no longer tasty. Anybody else found this?
i love your vids plzs never stop making them
Never disappointed,
Watching this while some mosquitos eat my arm
D E M O N   B A B Y
Baby mosquitos have buttstraws.
Genocide all Mosquitos.
Yep, I suspected it from the pupa that came up to breathe in the preview. I’ll come back to watch this new delicious video 😋👍
I had work experience at the Aedes aegypti lab at james cool university while I was in highschool. They payed people 20 dollar gift vouchers to feet the mosquitoes and got me separating make from female pupae. When I close my eyes saw the wriggle for days after my experience was over. They did eradicate dengue fever though.
This guy telling himself to grow up is so funny.
Hey, YouTube. Don't just casually slide a new zefrank video onto my little alarm bell there. I would like an actual, blaring alarm to let me know there's a new one of these. Thanks.
Finally 🥳🥳🥳
I needed this
For those who don't know: pretty sure the alien monstrosity at 3:07 is a giant water bug (Belostomatidae). They're huge, they sometimes fly, and their bite is quite painful (level 2 of 4 on the Schmidt's pain scale)
I wish all mosquitos would die
This whole video grossed me out so bad 🤮 Everything here is disgusting
"and ya know something's suckin' on them to, it's mosquitos all the way down" lmao
I have a question. Here it goes.... I  live in the northern US , I have mosquitos so heavy this year and can not understand what is so different this year than previous years. I mean we can not sit on the porch in the day time nor evening without getting ate up. I feed hummingbirds. I have 2 feeders in the front yard and 3 feeders in the back yard. I  continue to feed during migration through September to early October, could all the sugar water be drawing more than my share of mosquitos into my yard, and where can I get a couple of those elephant mosquitos to even things out? lol
3:12 kind of looks like an assassin bug, they inject enzymes into their prey and then use their snout/beak thingy to slurp up the goopy insides. They're pretty cool
Anyone else suddenly feel itchy while watching this?
“And now it’s getting dicked by a skeeter”
Well, I don't think I'll ever find any other reason to like mosquitoes... I didn't want to love them, but here I am laughing at toxorhynchites 😂
No fucking way!
The only insect we should deliberately make go extinct. They have no impact on earth other than to transmit the deadliest illnesses on earth
Don't miss the cool song at the end guys
"heLLOOO :D"
Always so good. Thx for making me laugh AND educating me.
"the little kinky bastards!"
Make one documentary about cows 🐮 would love to watch one of those , similar to the pigs one
I would be a lot more interested in the life of a mosquito if they didnt fill me with all of this unyielding rage. Today I have learned that there is only one breed that deserves to not die in fire, however.
While watching this video, I had a couple of these flying around
Perfection 💕
This is as disgusting as it is informative
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait... ... ... ... ..."ZAY-Frank??"
that is how the moscoweetoes do
Thank you!!!
D E M O N B A B Y
Can you put ads only at the begining. I know it probably makes more money, but it kinda sucks to watch.
I hate mosquitoes less after watching this. Never thought that was possible.
i already hated mosquitos...and then there was this video
a ze frank song is always appreciated.
I’ve learned so much
Now I know why my feet and lower legs are covered in mosquito bites and bite scars. I should start wearing shoes to bed. Too bad we didn't use DDT a little bit longer to wipe these jerks off the planet.
I'm about a minute in and already I know I'll need to watch this a few more times to get all of the dialogue. I'm laughing too hard!!!
I just extracted revenge on two bloody mosquitoes a few minutes ago.  🦟👻😄
As vector-biologist studying mosquitoes, this was just brilliant!
True Fact: I hate everything "mosquito" even nets; if a mosquito net is needed it means there are mosquitos about. Speaking of "about" the tiny little 🤬 are everywhere!
The butt first joke will never get old
Luv that good humar zoinked close to what i contrieve n jive being that shitglish language we unfortuneturlate have to community rated to the needle point in order to learb and pass knowledge to others to think in a unruly and truly way'
Dang it.  Only Zefrank made me have a slight higher respect for mosquitoes.
dale and jerry are dating im calling it RIGHT NOW!
I love these vids and you keep me laughing and informed.  Thank you!
I love Zefrank's videos  I also 100% still hate mosquitos
My skin started crawling at 00:49 when they started writhing out of their egg cases— anyone else?
The only episode where I'm glad the babies die.
I had to ask a professor the "Why do Mosquitos exist" Question, and I got the answer that they are needed as the diet of frogs and fish. Never would have considered the flower pollination thing too!
Please — The jokes aren’t funny…your information is more than good enough — without schoolboy toilet humor… thank you! 🙏
"Someone might get a wrong idea!"  Too late, Kyochū Rettō already exists and done it. Because, Japan...
I really appreciate the warning for that first shot, cuz I have that thing (it's called trypophobia)
Elephant mosquitos and most northern pitcher plant mosquitoes are the only ones I appreciate. Neither of them bite, and some pitcher plants even CHOOSE not to bite. They’re the real bros (yes I know they’re actually female but you get it)
Zefrank saying mosquito is.... very fun
3:45 It does. IT DOES. IT LITERALLY DOES!
I hate mosquitoes! But this is interesting

More!  I must have MORE!!
I'm leaving the planet because this is terrifying. One or two of you are welcome to join me.....Not you.
If a mosquitoe baby has my blood in it because the mom drank it am I the dad and if so do I have to pay child support
gosh, I though someone called me when I played the video.
Omg
The second time he said "Hello!" I knew that was how the video would end. I was not disappointed.
this. video. is. art. :D as usual <3
"Series of tubes."
Had no idea these bastards had such a crazy evolution!
We need more elephant mosquitoes in our life
I want mosquitoes to die and burn
When my little brother was very small he decided that mosquito larvae were called "kickadees". This summer I had a pet mosquito larva in my dogs' water bowl. I named him Leggany Kickit.
nice
I didn't think I could hate mosquitoes any more than I already do, This was very informative but it will definitely give me nightmares.
Ok, zefrank, what are you doing to me? Now I think mosquitos are cute….in the future I will have to carry them gently out of my bedroom with a glass and paper instead of smashing them.
This is literally the teaser for the game Spore
There's nothing worse than paying child support for a bug that will just eat you later on
I’d be more accepting of mosquitoes if they all entered the way this elephant mosquito did
Who would believe I could actually be broght to like mosquitos...
Curse those blood suckers The only thing that has managed to keep me awake until 5 am
A moment of respect for the guy that fully aloud a mosquito to drink his blood on camera without murdering that little bastard.
Thanks, I hate it!
Ze could We get a racoon video?
If zefrank didnt say anything, the first clip totally some demon spawn footage...
NEVER read a title more off... "Beautiful"? The only thing beautiful about a mosquitoes life is when you end it.
I hate mosquitoes 🤬🤬🤬
I absolutely loathe them, but that doesn't mean they're not interesting
This made me itchy.
The songs kill me
If a mosquito drinks your blood and lays eggs after. You are technically the father     :)
I remember when my jewish mensa treasurer, landlord, showed me one of these videos and he lost his shit to thr point that I couldn't enjoy it. Was this meant to be enjoyed alone or was he just replaying parts that really weren't that funny over and over until I convinced him to finish the video.
Lots of butt action this time around.
VERY NICE.
Fun smart video.😋...l just Sub'ed....Thanks👍👀
"Gettin' dicked by a skeeter, sweet Marie"
I'm still hoping for a ZeFrank/Attenborough team up nature series on Netflix.
i just felt about 60 different things on my skin
Nope... call me an insect racist if you must but all mosquito's must die.
Things I did not expect to learn today: There is a species of mosquito that has a foot fetish.
Who needs therapy when I can watch facts about mosquitos
17 minutes long! Wow! Good job!
Hey Zefrank1, how does it feel to consistently be the funniest person on this wacky space marble?
8:45 They are like those guys who impatiently await a teen to reach 18. Thai teen, btw, you never know is it male or female untill it undress...
That one predator that you didn't know was a small Giant Water Bug. 😉
I have a newfound respect for elephant mosquitoes
I appreciate the writing in this video
Zefrank video goes up. Me: Cool. I got 5 minutes. Sees video length. Me: Aw yeah. An excuse to make popcorn.
god I miss the singing...
Love these. They get funnier as you go through the library.
'mosquito bebes'  lol
I never knew mosquitoes were pollinators.  Ty.
14:28 FLAGRANT favoritism. How dare you sir. The only good one is the elephant mosquito you described who only eats the larvae of other mosquitoes, pollinates flowers,  doesn’t bite humans, and may or may not shoot lazers. I do enjoy how the larvae look like they have little motorized mustaches - almost cute
I hate mosquitoes
0:25 my reaction to mosquitos
I hate mosquitoes so much! I want them to go extinct in the UK at least so I don't have to put up with them anymore. They're such disgusting, repugnant demons!
1:18 "And they look a bit like those poles on bumper cars, that connect to the rooOOoof."
When are we napalming the 90% of mosquitoes?
Trypophobia intensifies.
love this guy.
Yeah having a higher human body count than humans is impressive…
That thumbnail makes me violent.
No offense, but I REALLY hate them :')
"Grow up."     Perfectly timed....
Well that is cute. You even had time to include a R Kelly segment.  Side note. Your shit is fucking hilarious.
It's a "Molest-squito".
Mosquitoes all the way down 😂
There really should be a warning about the whole mating with babies thing 8:43 I mean as a man watching this I’m like Jesus Christ please not another reminder that in nature all male animals are freaking rapists, uhp, there it is. There’s the unwanted sex I was trying to not think about, this is already a video about MOSQUITOES, I wouldn’t allow anybody except you to teach me about these horrifying things
I got new respect for earbuds.  ~_~
Killitwithfire!!!!!!
You are an inspiration to all of us who use random voices in waking life.
Cool. I like the style of commentary with this! Now kill them. They're a plague.
I have a question and you might just be the genious to answer me. I've had diabetes since I was eight, nearly twenty years ago, and since day one I've been told that mosquitoes have issues with people that have it. I can say that my brother gets swarmed by the little fuckers WAY more often than I do, but... Is it real that mosquitoes die when they take blood from someone with a disease like diabetes? Can they even tell? Because it's kind of an urban legend and at this point I have absolutely no idea.  See ya lad, and keep up with the cool videos!
Oh hecc yeah I've been waiting so long for a new one. Great work as usual!
The final song: pure genius.
Mosquitoes suck 🙂
All vector mosquitos should die. Period.
National Treasure.

3:09 if I remember right in Danish it’s scorpion tick
Such a joy to hear that voice! Although now I so much know more than I ever wanted about mosquitos’ butts❤️
Please you need to do more! O fricking love you
Demon baby!
oh zhe moskito song is buzzing 🎶
Almost got killed by this thing.
<3
💗💗💗
There's a troubling part of me that would love to listen to ZeFrank narrate darker subject matter. Like Caligula (1979), starring Malcolm McDowell. Or the rise and fall of Andy Dick
try the vinegaroon next
HEY GUESS WHAT!?   AFTER 100 YEARS OF RESEARCH, *_WE HAVE A MALARIA VACCINE!!!!!!!_*
after the dragonfly larva, that's a water scorpion... worst part is they can survive on land and even fly... They got a nasty grip and a pretty painful sting/kiss if I have to believe others...
Funny how I was thinking "Why do mosquitos exist!" Then this pops up.
The name Mosquito implies the existence of the larger and more dangerous El Mosqo
“heelllllLLLOOO!!”  lmao I’m so thankful I grew up with zefrank
in their little white coats. on the funny farm. hee hee ho ho haha
I like the way he initially pronounced mosquitoes as "moss-ku-weetos"
Fuck I thought that I was tricking them by holding my breath but it appears that I’ve been an idiot for my entire life
Wow can't believe I'm a dad to probably thousands of mosquitos. Might have accidentally killed my kids ;-;
♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Do Betta Fish!
I still say its worth it to burn them all. We can name a few buildings after the plants and animals that die because of it. At least i can finally sleep... oh and we save some humans too
I can confirm...I was the Larvae
Mosquitoes that eat other mosquitoes and don't bite people? Can we start mass-cloning them, please?
These videos are just hilarious and amazing. Well done. More please
we need more elephant mosuitos to kill other mosquitos
Do you think Jerry is a real person or someone zefrank made up for comedic purposes?
i now appreciate these little arseholes a lot more. Job well done.
YouTube never makes me happier than when a new True Facts pops up in my suggestions.
🤣😂
Won't SOMEBODY PLEASE think of the BEBBES?!!
so it turns out mosquitoes are fascinating creatures? You learn something new every day
Made me think of "trainspotting" when that baby is crawling on the ceiling and stops and rolls it's head all the way around 😂
Me through this entire video: “KILL IT KILL IT KILL IT KILL IT.”
I am a biology major. I have done the math (I haven't). Mosquitos and wasps can easily be replaced in the food chain and they offer no benefit to the ecosystem besides the calories they provide when consumed and some pollination but it's not very effective as they are not selective feeders and aren't really equipped to hold much pollen like a bee is.  Eliminate them all besides the Elephant mosquito
FINALLY!!! THE KING HAS UPLOADED
More goodness 😉
If only you had taught all of my classes in this fashion growing up, I would be a quantum computer by now
👁👄👁
This is the funniest one so far, which is impressive given how old this channel is
I just cant get enough of zebranks way of pronouncing "baby"
HELLOO!  Marvellous. Keep it up ZeFrank! And thank you to all the great researchers who help make your videos possible too!
Painful existence
Elephant mosquito supremacy.
i saw 17 min and sighed gladly and reliefed...
They pollinate, that's what they're good for.   Appart from figs, wasp are terrible pollinators and are highly abusive to other species. They're the only insect I think we could easily stand to live without.
Thx for the hole-warning!
Zefrank, you need to do a "How it's Actually Made". And Huggbees needs to do a True Facts. C'mon.
For my fellow trypophobes, you’ve got from 0:31 to about 1:03. Watch at your own risk.
That big bug is called a Toe Biter, colloquially. Can't remember the real name.
👏🙂
Thankful this series is still going on
Oh no, those foot people on twitch were actually mosquitos!   When I see the female mosquito filled with blood it reminds me of the video where the scientists pinch a nerve and the mosquito doesn't realize when it's had enough blood, so it bursts.
It would be a very different world if we all just took a couple months in our teens & retreated into a chrysalis to turn into adults.
The song at the end was straight Gold lmao
Who the hell would dislike this video? 88 of y'all
cool i want to pour a whole gallon of bleach in a pool full of them
*the stupid ugly life of dumb useless bugs that I hate  Fixed the title for you
I’m gonna need you to make videos more often, ya
This is the only zefrank video I’ve seen where the animal in question interrupted me partway though
And now I’m feeling itchy all over. Why do I do this to myself?
You are now aware of how itchy your skin is.
We should hire more mosquitos as surgeons, they are so good at it.
Malaria kills millions of poor people per year, but capitalists can't be bothered.
Fucking hilarious
4:41...🤣🤣🤣 6:40...hello to you too. 😆😆
When I was in 4th grade I wanted to create a mechanical pencil that shoots tiny needles that can kill mosquitos or flies at classroom ranges.  I had no intention at shooting fellow students. I wanted to bullseye bugs when I was bored in class.
Mosquitoes are a critical food source for a lot of species. They're good for that, unfortunately. If we somehow wipe them out, we'll cripple a lot of food chains.
Johnston's organ can sense the slightest movement......grow up!
And now we have a malaria vaccine!
I want to murder them all  Edit: with exception to the elephant mosquito. It's like the perfect mosquito.
I don't care! They bite me, I kill em.
Watching this got me itchy for some reason
2:11  *DEMON BABEH*
Wait a minute. If male mosquitos are polinators, and we kill all mosquitos, doesn't it meen we destroy our echo systems?
helLOOW!!!
I wanna take a blow torch to each and everyone of these
Honestly. I always learn a ton (whether I want to or not), but MY GOSH!! These are the best, zefrank, for when I really need a laugh. Bad day? Just watch a little zefrank documentary and BOOM! Better than an antidepressant! Please never stop. Never, EVER stop. The bebes need this.
true fact: the two genera of mosquitoes--excuse me, moskwo-ee-toes---that drink human blood are named Aedes and Anopheles. The former means "unpleasant" in Greek and the latter  is Greek for "unwanted" or "useless." Man, even the taxonomists got no love for the buggers.
im sold on those elephant mosquitos!
If science were taught like this more people would learn it. We desperately need more scientists to lessen the effects of religious beliefs. Religious indoctrination of children is a difficult thing to overcome. Especially when the religious parents and religious instructors denigrate science and scientists because facts, truth and questioning is deadly to faith. And they don’t care if their faith based beliefs are true or not, they just want more believers. Though some are genuine believers, I think a large portion have realized how much money and privilege comes with religion.
Day made by a single video
Love it
And look at that they eat ya butt first ( but first! ) too, it's a terrible way to die. Start with my face if you eat me!
1:21 connect to thE ROOF
Scared of mosquitoes? Yes I am Watching this? Yes I am
Don't ask what something's good for... Yep.
There was a study recently about mammals breathing underwater via concentrated air enemas in an emergency. Technically, a mammal (ahem, a Homo Sapien) can breathe through the blood vessels in the rectum. I am not trying it.
this makes me appreciate the accuracy of early level spore
For the rest of my life, I will refer to these as Mosskoweetos. 😌
that was excellent!!!
Finally another video! 😲❤
can someone tell me what the creature at 3:08 is please im curious.
Great job. Never stop, pls!! 👏🏻
Ah yes, my favorite source of quotes to confuse and concern my friends and family with.
Thank you for the trigger warning. Genuinely appreciate that
Worth the wait!
Ayo wait, elephant mosquitos are actually homies?
Finally MOSQUITO!!!
Ah mosquitoes aka that one insect even hardcore animal lovers can't stand
Can you upload those sick outro songs to spotify? I absolutely have to have them in my playlist
Me: *giggling* Zefrank: "Grow up" It's like he knows us or something .
I now like one species of mosquito.
This might be the most well researched and professionally done joke I've ever watched
D E M O N  B E B E S
Learned more hear than in all the hours I had to listen to stuff about Mosquitoes in Uni.
Yaaaaaaas!
"bebies
“And now it’s getting dicked by a skeeter”
insane footage like goddamn
3:07 giant waterbug or toe biter or ball biter or finger biter or d--- biter or face biter
I love how this is both educational and funny!
Into their tum tums. 😂
Booba
Babeh
I was the biter in my kindergarten.
This whole episode is just a constant "kill it with fire".
"That's right. There are mosquito babies out there that are made up from bits of you!"  Well they better not come looking for child support!
Really needed your fun today!!!
-bebe-
HELLO
PLEASE DO TRUE FACTS CICADAS
*Me who just ate a bagel*
I watched to the end for a terribly long dad joke about chickens...put me in a fowl mood.
so i cant wish for mosquitos to go extinct cool :/
So even mosquitoes gets mosquito bite 😯
well its good to know that even mosquitos have mosquito problems
HELLOOOO
HELL-OOOO. I missed you so much😍
Thanks I hate mosquitos more now
From one of most cracked videos in history of internet teddy to this cracked series well keep going buddy entertain us.
12:04 Almost made me spit my tea
"But(t) first..." That got me.
3:08 I believe that’s a toebiter
0:20 reminded me of Cell from DBZ.....
I am the type of person that attracts all the mosquitos in the house, the one that gets stung all over and hates them. I appreciate them a little more now, but at least sting my other family members once.
Mosquito should be saying GOODBYE. I swear the injection site always swells up like a friggan balloon whenever I get bit ;u; And we ALL know bug spray doesn't work. Blehhhhhhh!   Anyways! Great episode Zefrank! Always top notch~
Get the Chancla
The way I gasped in excitement when I saw this
Hahahahahaha!  Of course.
Tip for dealing with mosquitoes: If you’re trying to kill one in midair and can’t seem to get it, try clapping a couple inches above the mosquito. For some reason, they almost always fly up, so all you have to do is adjust for it and bam, dead mosquito.
Yay
So… blood is just a lady mosquitoes cravings coming into work?
I did what I was told; I ate whilst watching, and didn't retch once! I'm very proud. Oh.. Wait... Where's my medal?
WHO has approved the first malaria vaccine! Maybe someday we'll completely neutralize these fucking things
d e m o n  b a b y
Now I hate mosquitos even more.. Thanks =P
Hello!
That's the thing about kindergarten, there's always a biter!
And here comes the beh bees!
صرت أتحكّك
Bebes
local man arrested for trying to breathe through anal cavity at local swimming pool "like a mosquito" said the man in a interview.
I didn't think I would ever love a mosquito, but this video made me love the Elephant Mosquito, Toxorhynchites.
I'm really happy I'm not the only one who thinks mosquitos are beautiful insects, great video <3
"It's mosquitos all the way down"  Excellent!
Cute Killers
I’M ITCHY.
Now why did I think it was a good idea to eat during this? I mean, I still finished and it was delicious, but still
Zefrank1, I wish you'd at least mentioned one mosquito that you overlooked -- the de Havilland Mosquito.  It was a real pain in the ass for the Nazis!  And it could have been a real "Jerry" moment!
Aww you released it my birthday, thank you Zefrank, you shouldn't have!
Can we appreciate how absolutely stunning the footage is? Hats off to the people who filmed it
As usual, the song is a banger
I don't have trypophobia...I'm actually quite fascinated by these parasites and the other arachnid is called a nepidae also commonly known as a water scorpion
H E L L O
Fantastic who would have thought parental care from a mos.i still hate them
4K, pls
I have held my breath to avoid skeeters lol
12:04 DED LMAO. I almost just choked on my coffee. xD
I exclaimed out loud "oh fuck that" when they started popping out of the eggs from the corn cob lookin thing
Not so fun fact: thanks to climate change more and more places across the planet are becoming warm enough for the Aedes Aegypti mosquito, which carries Yellow Fever, Dengue , Zika and a few other nasties, to survive where a few decades ago they couldn't. Yay.
Why would any one dislike this
Mosquito says, "Hello." I say, "Hell no."
I have mosquito bites on me right now and I feel disgusted thanks.
"And now it's getting dicked by a skeeter".
Who the fuck is Dale and what happened to Jerry!?  Oh nvm, Jerry was there too! Crisis averted.
Nice to know mosquitoes are pollinators and even vital pollinators in some cases. On the other hand, watching one drink blood under a microscope makes me hate them even more now.
I never wanted anything in my life so badly, finally another Zefrank video
Love it
I always enjoy watching your content it's just so funny 🤣
Yeah no i hate those eggs
So not all mosquito's are bloodsuckers
Sounds like something a clam would say
True fact about mosquito is they are suck
Ur fuckin great Zefrank
Mosquitoes - The most dangerous animal on the planet. Why God created them, we will never know
Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrroof
Just what i needed
Someone should arrest these mosquitoes, they dont have a liscense to fly
i have trypophobia and i hate u
*demon bebbe*
Jesus Christ why is everything in insect scale straight out of a fucking Alien movie
Nothing you've ever made has made me feel quite this itchy.
I feel like i got bit by 20 mosquitos during this.
Mosquitoes, in addition tae being pollinators are also a highly nutritious food for other animals, like birds and spiders.   The young are mostly eaten by fish and other predators.   And adults with blood in them are fantastic meals for those who eat them
I always wanted to learn more about Moscow-itos
I love animals and life, but there is no mercy in my heart for mosquitoes
I boiled a mosquito in the shower yesterday
Neat
Thank you for the amazing video, as always!
Awesome content mayne👍👍
full version of mosquito song wen?
Huh...you pronounce it "Zay", not "Zee".
“Those 5% are a doozy”
Your episode on frogs gave me tryptophobia. This wasn't that bad. I guess its just with flesh holes.
About to play this... will sucking be involved!? :)
Pen is
"Bebes"
God I can never get enough of learning and cackling from these. And I freaking LOVE the music you make for this stuff. 1000/10 would by an album. Please make one!
A birthday present! Thank you!
LOVE your videos!!!!!
DEMON BABEEE
Mosquitos suck. Tell me I'm wrong🤨
"It's how lady Gaga would come out on stage, very dramatic."  A overly gaudy, bloodsucking parasite which makes a loud annoying buzzing sound... Sounds about right.
Lovely intro to the specimen my man. "What the Fuh!!"
Seriously, how could anyone dislike this? This is great content!  Now I know that not ALL mosquitoes bite and they even pollinate flowers.
Make Video About Beetle please 🙏
It makes me second guess jumping into the lake and getting water in my mouth!!!! I just ate a baby mosquito...🤔🤔🤔😅😅😅😅😅
Excellent content!
"Demon Babeh" Well played...
Delivered the goods as usual.
Trypophobia warning at 0:25, although it doesn't get much better.
How can my 23 second attention span be captivated for 17 minutes by skeeters 🤔
Yup, I got arrested.
I'd like to see someone name a mosquito pupa "Napstablook".
why does it seem like trypophobia is a trending topic right now?
I have been waiting for a long time for a new video!!!!! Thank u!!!! 😎😎😎😎😎🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Mosquitos and wasps...please make them go extinct, fu** the balance in the ecosystem...i would personally deal with the consequences :)
ur a rare gem.  thank you
HERE COME THE BEHBEHZ !!
This video makes me itchy.
True facts about the moss-skwo-itoes: Fuck moss-skwo-itoes. That is all.  (Fill remaining time with "Koalas in the Rain")
so good. wow had no idea they eat flowers. that's kinda cute actually. i guess they do have their part in helping those specific flowers. but still... fuck mosquitos. if they get close, i'm the one biting!
its a good day when this slacker finally uploads
Please tell me someone is going to their local swimming pool right now 😊
A 17 min zefrank video??? I'm in heaven 🤤
Jerry, where are you?
🤣🤣🤣if Zefrank was a teacher his class would be awesome
So Pleakley, from Lilo and Stitch, was right!
Demon bebes 🤪
Thank you
Dale WTF!! Let’s back up a bit  LMAO
I'm loving the longer videos
New Mosquito lore just dropped, pog
My name is Dale and I am blind and when I put this on I did a double take just the first few lines made my heart so happy. Thank you. I will now listen to the rest of the video probably several times..
F**K mosquitos. If I had the power to make any animal go extinct I think it would be mosquitoes.
Learn to think? Does this mean you're gonna stop thinking so I don't have to?
Thank for the trypophobia warning at the start, was fine until they started hatching
Nature is fascinating, and when narrated by zefrank1 - also very entertaining!
ZeFrank gets more and more feral for every upload he does and I am here for it
Life will go on even if mosquitoes go extinct. Sure, some ecosystems will be rocked, but really what else is new
muito foda
You didn't say the most important part: WHY THE HELL ARE WE ITCHY AND HAVE AN INFLAMMATION AFTER THE BITE!?
OMG! I thought there was no new content coming. This is great a little gross but funny!
63 mosquitoes downvoted this video.
Fun fact! If you pinch the skin around the area where the mosquito is drinking they can’t disengage and will keep drinking blood until they explode!
Wait, so you’re telling me I don’t need to have my own baby to carry on my bloodline?
so could there possibly be a mosquito that fed off a mosquito that fed off a mosquito that fed off a mosquito...etc? :O
This vidieo is what I needed to motivate me to work on my flamethrower. Thank you.
Amazing! More please
Hysterical
Still hate em
It doesn't matter I still hates mosquitos
I already know that this will be the best part of my day.
Jerry doesn't exist, does he.
parasitic mosquito: "Oh boy, time for a first flight!" dragonflies, frogs and elephant mosquitoes: *"OH BOY, DINNER!"*
Hello!! Classic!
Ah! The Boies
Thanks I hate it
1:18 I really appreciate the extra spice you threw on "rrrrooOOOF."
I think I was better off before learning that elephant mosquitoes exist.
Well done sir.
YES I'VE BEEN WAITING FOREVER FOR A NEW VIDEO😍
Thank you for these.
Thanks I hate it
Thanks for showing us once again how absolutely horrifying the natural world is. I'm going to stay inside my house for the rest of my life now.
An episode about a creature a hate with a burning passion due to their love of blood as females with baby making. I wish to learn about them so I may kill them better
Demon. Baby. *Synchronized head swivel*
Who else came here for the sole purpose of seeing how he pronounces mosquito
Even though were having a west nile virus spike, its nice to see this lol
Aaaand now the Mosquito Song is stuck in my head. I'm sure it's Jerry's fault.
I would love to see you talk about humans lol
Clicked Like already before I had started watching, and as ever, you sir, did NOT disappoint.. :D
These endcard songs are great
Finally a new video from papa frank
God I hate that you told me that mosquitoes are important to our environment.
Should have edited in sword fighting sound effects when the two males were competing for the female.
On the other hand i might pour oil on the water
damn the comments are absolutely losing their shit about a fucking Animal
Without watching the video I'm expecting something about "sucking" and "that's what she said".
Only Ze could make mosquitoes entertaining.  Helllllllloooo
Oh yes
When is the album out? Between "Mosquito Says Hello..." and "Motherfuckin' Sexy Ostrich," I am prepared to overpay.
This video makes me itchy
I just hate this tipe of bug Man 😩
Kinky bastards I'm not paying child support
Demon bebees.... what I call my cousins kids...
That was creepy but so well narrated that I laughed the whole way through
It's always a good day when zefrank drops a video
Is this in honor of the malaria vaccine? Very cool!
“Otherwise known as *MOSCO*-OUITOS”
HELLOOOO
Helllllloooooooo 🦟
Salty chicken Merch please 💀
All in favor of a "True Facts about the zefrank1"? 😁
*WORST SPECIES EVER*
They get longer and longer. Eventually there'll be a one hour documentary about house flies!
Theses fuckers gave me some sort of ptsd after i had to hunt down every single one that entered my house this summer. I literally hear phantom buzzing in my ears sometimes
BEST videos on the Internet!
It keeps amazing me that people are willing to sponsor these. Maybe the education cancels out the vulgarity.
i dont care if they pollinate plants kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill kill  etc.
Why yes, it does look like the inside view of a Teddy Bear being humped by a Chihuahua! I imagine?
Wow, I haven't snort-laughed in months! This was fantastic!  🦟❤🦟❤🦟❤🦟❤🦟❤🦟❤🦟
thanks to zeFranks narration I made until almost the end before the Itch set in.  HELLO!!
Nepa cinerea stan
the amount of effort that goes into these episodes is amazing
A common "hobby" when I was younger is to offer an arm to the skeeters, and when one or two land and start enjoying a blood meal... that's when you tense up the arm muscles which prevents them from withdrawing. They will continue swelling up with blood until they burst, leaving a little fingernail-sized blood spatter where they were.
"There are mosquito bebehs that were made from the bits of _you_ " Honestly that freaks me out
I actually did not know that Mosquitoes were pollinators. *sigh* Of COURSE there would be a reason keeping us from exterminating them.
EARLY with the 👍🏾  today!!
Video did not contain enough death by fire.
I'd love to see one of bed bugs god I love these videos
Rrrrrrroof?
I was so happy to see another zefrank episode, I watched the ENTIRE  ad for Brilliant!
Bruh kill it with fire eww
Oh God I'm amazed and need to throw up in my mouth at the same time. How confusing
This one's great
OMFnG!!!! I LOOOOOVE #frankze!!!! I'm laughing so hard, I'm crying!!!! 🤣🤣
*Explains Brilliant* Me: "Brilliant!"
I really hope David Attenborough watches this.
Demon bebeh!!!
I have some very different kind of  aquariums in my house and mosquitoes are breeding in them and using us mammals as hosts.
*_HELLO..._*
Absolutely died when zefrank stopped the entire show to tell me off for giggling at Johnston's tiny organ.
Mosquitoes feeding on mosquitoes. 🧚🏻‍♀️
You're a damned legend
We’ve missed you Zefrank! Awesome content. I wish we had more of your videos. Your content is filled with science cranked up to the max level of clean comedy! Thank you!
"Snufagulufus but reimagined as a dildo wearing glasses. Does that help, Dale?" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I keep trying to tell people, “That big one doesn’t drink blood! And it eats the mosquitoes who do!” But nobody listens…
Wait, there are mosquitoes with a foot fetish? No wonder I'm always getting bit around the ankles.
15:14 💀💀💀
>.> we need to breed the elephant mosquitos and release them in problem areas so the mosquitos that bite die off xD we dont need blood suckers just the one that pollinates or maybe we could fix other species dna to be like them xD
I like how brilliant sponsers this and Zefrank is So F...ing   BRILLIANT.
May Zefrank never stop making this blessed series.
My imaginary child said something really witty about this video
I live for these videos🥰🥰🥰🥰
Poor johnston
He makes looking at bugs so much more tolerable. And I thank him.
´´Thats right, there are mosquitoes bebes that are made from bits of you.´´ Yeah well now i feel like Genghis Khan
*phantom itching intensifies*
Absolutely “Brilliant”!! I’m laughing too hard to type!
Had me in the first half. Not gonna lie.
8:08
This video gave me an itch
AWESOME!
You can tell he had fun with this one
You're still the best.
"Looks like the stress-testing room in a condom factory."  That has to be the analogy of the year!  :-D
Zika Virus is still going on :(
I missed you. I am so glad you're back.
I'm surprised this man and his team doesn't have an national televised sitcom. He pretty funny. He kinda reminds me of Sienfeld.
Love it!
I cannot unsee the depressed ghost. Help me.
really appreciate the amount of research/footage you need to get to put all this together htpfhhthh Benedikt who filled his apartment with mosquitos.... dedication
That pink flamingo scared the crap out of me. I couldn't figure out what it was at first.
All mosquitoes should be like elephant mosquitoes
Butt-first.
The thing at 3:07 is a giant toebiter. Sweet dreams!
Damn, everybody eatin' ass out here.
Johnston organ
The only mosquito we need, the one that never bite
I thought I wouldn't like a video about mosquitoes but here we are <3 The fact that not all species search for blood makes me realize how little I know about them... So thanks!
Wow, I always hated mosquitos but now after watching this video that show miraculous they are I hate them even more
A wholesome.....loved it 💚
It's been a while since your last video, good to see you're still around.
I actually do have trypophobia ... Clusters of holes and things like coral really set it off ... I should've listened to your warning, I thought "yeah right, people are forever linking it with things that aren't even that bad". I thought " oh those holes are gross but not that terrible".........  Until it started writhing and clustering up!  I should've listened 😔😳😟
Pupa used harden. Pupa’s defense went up.
Wow I'm a mosquito dad somewhere
54 really
I T C H  God I hate these things, i'd rather have tarantulas cutting about
we need more elephant mosqueeeeeetoes
Fascinating creatures. We should destroy all of them.
interesting video but GIVE ME MY F*CKING FLAMETHROWER
I love you
Anybody else feel itchy before, during, and after watching this?
Bee: buzz 🐝  Cow: moo 🐄 Mosquito: hello~ 💅
The real horror is why I can't see these catalogued under "Fun & Entertainment" AND "Educational".  --Wait, scratch that. Mosquitos are still scarier.
I love your channel, buddy, and I shot you a like. That said- I can't finish this video. Mosquitoes are my least favorite creatures on planet earth.
Just in time for Halloween. It's horrifying and entertaining.
the thing that made me laugh the most is when he said "those poles on bumper cars that connect to the roof". its not even really related to the video but the way he said it hit me right in the funnybone IDK WHY
My organs not that tiny
Damn even these things biology makes me want to exterminate them
"This looks like the inside view of a teddy bear being humped by a chihuahua" chokes on brownie
11:12 The nightmarish details of a mosquito bite begin.
Before watching this video I used to think mosquitos but mosquito larvae especially, were pretty gross. My opinion has changed, for the most part. Great footage, as well!
That little bug has no right being that complicated!
I look forward to your videos more than any others Zefrank. You totally rock and now I have yet another great song to sing at work to drive my co-workers crazy.
New zefrank video, I'm buzzing with excitement! 😀
Everyone love these videos
I really have to remember to NOT be eating or drinking anything while watching Ze Frank's videos. I mean, heh-LOW!
That "He - lloooooo" killed me.
WHAT HAPPENED TO JERRY
True facts about the mosskeeeteeeeer.
Those damn bloodsuckers might be the only case where I honestly don't care about the environmental consequences of wiping out an animal. It doesn't matter if they're pollinators, kill them all. We'll just have to clone some bees or something.
Johnston's Organ
*opens YouTube* *sees true facts guy new video* my mind goes "f**k yeah, finally"
It was Demon Baby for me! 😂
Thank you I waited so long for this pls put out the next one soon
Are you trying to make me feel sorry for Swatting mosquitoes?
WERE YOU BEEN BRO ?????
Awesomeness! ❤
Purge them in holy flame!
17 minute True Facts? Challenge accepted!  Let's be honest though, we've all binged lots more True Facts at once than that.
Another brilliant.. ly haphazard deep dive into the tiny world of earths crazy critters.. and the anatomy of their mind boggling butts. Maybe a little too deep a dive. Then again.. maybe not. 😁 👍
A new Video 🤩 dude you just safed my day 😁
I've never seen such precise asslip movement
I just love the way he says, "babies".
*_hello!_*
Me, watching this, not realizing one of them is feeding of my leg
"bebies"
Mosquitoes getting absolutely lost in the sauce
Demon baby
Love the professional bibliography at the end.
F in the chat for them earbuds for getting d***ed by a skeeter.
all i can think of is that teddy video and it just makes these so much funnier
I was hoping this would help my minor phobia of Mosquitoes but... nooo.
Video summary: you might be the father/mother of hundreds upon hundreds of mosquitoes
Hello!! I thought I'd never get to see another one💕🤗. Hope all is well with you.
Am I the only one who, while killing mosquitos on sight, is actually fascinated by them? Just like pretty much any other animal, they are always so, so much more than they seem.
Always worth a share….great work zefrank 👍🏼🍻
It was so satisfying hearing Zefrank pronounce it as mo skwee toe 🤣
I love this serious
Jeez! Just look at them! Super creepy annoying disease carrying killers.  Burn them with FIRE!!! 🔥🔥🔥☠️☠️☠️
OMG your back !!!!!!!! 💜
"It's how lady Gaga would come out on stage, very dramatic" ...  Future times : Lady Gaga emerges from under the water and reveals herself as being a Mosquito this entire time!
Oh cool, maybe I can find facts on how to eradicate mosquitos edit; well now I can’t since they’re pollinators
i dont care what anyone says; the world would be a better place if mosquitoes went extinct!
I am getting itchy watching this
I personally hate them
Here from TikTok. I always look forward to these
This video gave me Dengue
mosquitos almost never bite me for some reason. I've been camping all summer and been bitten less that 10 times even with them everywhere. One day I was getting tired of walking so I set up camp in what turned out to be a lowland area by a swamp lake. Set up my hammock and from the ground up to knee height it was thick with mosquitoes . I walked around barefoot and only got bitten a couple of times. Still anoying when they swarm to, i guess, smell me but no big deal  I'll sit and watch them try and just fly away like "nope"   nettles dont sting me either
Im watching a video about mosquito while being swarmed by the very same thing here
4:29 Jeff goldblum?
I watched the video because I'm a fan... But i hate mosquitoes so much it was painful. Love your stuff, keep it up
This is the only channel that I have subscription alerts turned on for... Not just any alerts.. I mean bypass EVERYTHING alerts, including audible alerts with DND mode on. Love these videos!!!!! Thank you so much!!!
Forbidden strawberry
A hundred million years ago, there were mosquitoes just like today, and just like today they fed on the blood of animals, even dinosaurs. Sometimes after biting the dinosaur, the mosquito would land on a branch of a tree and get stuck in the sap!
its a great news about those genetically engineered mosquitos bred without them carrying the Malaria virus
YAY!!!  This is what my Saturday needed.
These are great and all but I can't wait to fail another human test xD
All those little beybeyz???
Yay zefrank1 post again. Love your channel 😄
I love you Zefrank ❤️ Just that
Straightens his tie, grabs the rope to begin ringing the bell.  "ZeFrank! ZeFrank!"
3:07 Is that a toe-biter? will there be a "True Facts: The Toe Biter" or whatever the real name is.
I bet the Brilliant people loved that segue.
8:29 Why does this pair of mosquitoes fighting look like literally every pro level Tekken fight? XD
you are funny as hell, love it
This video is 17 minutes long but it took me 25 minutes to watch. Too many interesting details in the footage kept going by fast.
Honestly if they didn't spread disease and itch, I wouldn't mind them. Like, I can respect it... but c'mon man stop making it bad.
Excellent episode! Thank you for sharing your gift of humor with the world 🙂
Mosquitos suck
W H A  T    T  H  E     F U   - ---
ok, anyone else start itching when the explanation of how they bite and suck up blood was on screen?
I love the idea that someone will mistake you for an insect porn freak.
Aedes Aegypti in Brasil be like "guys i have some gifts for you all"
People will be kicking themselves in few weeks if they miss the opportunity to buy and invest in Crypto as it's retracing....BE WISE
Maybe we would like mosquitoes more if we got rid of the pathogens. We got rid of smallpox, after all.
The way you say "baby"... er, sorry - "bebbeh"... makes every video 200% better.
3:10 Water Scorpion! Those are some sick animals @zefrank1
This came out soooo great!
It's mosquitoes... All the way down.... 😂 😂 💀
So he forgot one one fact: Mosquitos are amphibians just like a frog. Right? Maybe. 😂🤣
I really needed this today.  ☺️
“Shown here with a match, so you can see how hard it is for them to pick up a smoking habit” 💀
Now I can feel better when I slap one and they leave a red splat on my arm.
This improves my mood instantly 😹
"Elephant mosquito - tucks her in kitties" Love closed captions!
Well... If there are mosquito babies out there with my DNA I'm not paying child support....😂
Thank you to the only man that can get me interested in Science!
That mosquito song makes my skin itch. Also, what's the difference between and blonde and a mosquito? The mosquito stops sucking when you slap it.
So elephant mosquitoes are Saints.
I hope all mosquitoes were harmed during the production of these videos.
Today I learned I don't hate all mosquitos, the elephant variety seems pretty chill.
ah yes, a video with information to allow me to PERFECTLY explain why i hate mosquitos... little shits.
"And people are very good at killing people"
thank god i paid no child support 13:33
The moral of the story is we need to start breeding elephant mosquitoes into being the dominant mosquito species
I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe 🤣🤣 this is the best! HELLO! 🤣
This confirmed what I've been thinking for years: we should eradicate them.
Oh baby
Umm as im eatin an English muffin!!thanx lol!YES FINALLY...ive been waiting awhile for a new awesome hilarious video from u n finally its here!!haha ur the best!
Well done!  Thank you so much!
I LOVE IT! Thanks for making gross learning SO FUN!! Demon BEBE!! LMAO!!
Thanks ze.
Ah. the '80s Aegyptae. They fly like an Egyptian.
After a long week of family in hospitals, never making ends meet, son-in-law-in-jail-by-law, and my truck brakes are squeelling again, It sure is nice to have an old fashioned belly laugh or two.  Hell, it doesn't matter if it's a subject I've never seen, or something we all love/hate, I watch them all because of the presentation style. Besides, how can you not enjoy a guy that not only talks to the audience, but has whole dialogues with an invisible co-worker?  Thanks for picking me up. I think I have a lifetime subscription here.  "Jerry, just tell him what I said, he won't care how old I am. What do you mean I've cheated him? I still have at least a few hundred mosquito lifespans left, and you see how just one gets him all atwitter. Well just don't tell him I'm human, Jerry, he'll never know." Now I know what Frankie goes through. " I heard that, Jerry! I'll bet you're the one that laid out the *Ze Frank* thing to stand out in a crowd. He may hate that name, and I'll bet his mother never called the school and asked the teacher if *Ze Frank* remembered to take lunch money? No, she didn't, and neither will I.  Yes Jerry, I'll still type it your way on FB, don't get all wadded up. You do know, you're the reason he's about half crazy. You're the schitzo part of him that he can't get away from. That's it Jerry, go pout in silence."  Where was I? Oh yes, thanks for letting me let go easier. And may you have your own place to let go. (Jerry, stop it. I am aware you think he already let's too much go. Jerry, it's for his own good, so....oh never mind, finish your wine and go home Jerry.) 😁
So excited a Zefrank video
Another zefrank masterpiece to refer to my science teacher, uncultured she may be... but all of my classmates' priceless reactions shall be more than enough to outweigh her imminent threats towards me.
I didn't know that mosquitoes are pretty!
Do assassin bugs
My nemesis!!!
"This looks like the view from inside a Teddy bear that's being humped by a Chihuahua" is not a phrase I thought I would hear today but I'm glad that it happened
Ze, you’re the best bro… met you at A Flash conference (San Fran) 2005.  Inspiring to see you still on top!
Mosquito are literally useless and annoying
That Trypophobia warning was not soon enough!!  Lol!  I was already invested and mortified and horrified!  BUT as always, Zefrank videos are amazing!
Thanks now I’m terrified of mosquitoes
mos-quo-ito i will try to remember that 🤭
I love mosquitoes, they're so warm and cuddly
WHERES JERRY?!!!!
Love your channel bro! Keep it up!
And I thought mosquitos could not be any worse than they already were, and now this shit gets dropped on me: 8:30 .
Watching this I suddenly flashed back to my childhood and remembered the time I drank a bunch of mosquito larvae out of a dirty puddle on a dare. Thanks Zefrank
"Mo-squo-itoes" lol :p
When the world needed him, most he returned
Oh my god... my other half found Zefrank. Now I'm subscribed and I tell everyone and anyone about this channel.  I learn stuff and end up with a stitch from laughing. Absolutely brilliant!!
I am home with COVID and boy you don’t know how happy I am for another one of the best series on the Internet
you're going to want to Google the giant water bug, also called the toe bitter, and you future video on it will be awesome
Imagine being a snake who was bitten on the tip of their tale...
I absolutely love this series and the way it uses humor to make me appreciate how gross and amazing nature is.  I always start out a little grossed out and by the end I am in love with whatever weird little critter we are talking about.  The fact that all this footage exists and such intricate detail is known about the life cycles of all these animals is a testament to all the hard work of biologists and researchers.  Ze Frank points all this out while still being funny and ridiculously watchable. Love it.
Zefrank you are my favorite! Thank you for making my day, and keep them coming!
I hope people see this video and realize that mosquitoes don't need chemical pesticides to control them as much as we just need to support all the insects and other animals that eat them.
So if most of the female mosquitoes that bite you  lay their eggs within 500 meters of where you live, there is a good chance that the mosquito biting you in your back yard has your DNA and is therefore related to you.   In other words, we are all involved in mosquito incest hundreds of times a year 🤮
It's literally Spore at 2:13 and I love it
Long live the king
Babe wake up new zfrank video!
Appetizing ...
too bad you don't make videos often, they're informative and hilarious lol
Started getting itchy as I watched this video. But still loved it!
Hellloowww.....
I've always hated the little bastards, but those stylish entrances almost makes me want to forgive the evil blood suckers.
Dale!? What happened to Jerry!
You could make a long video about the process of paint drying, and somehow it would still be the most interesting thing i have seen all day. Keep up the good work. Love your videos!
That closing song is bomb xD
More people have died on the face of this planet in the name of religion than all other Wars and conflicts and diseases combined
Wooo! He returns with another amazing video
Just amazing
I'm here! Why did you make me watch this!?
My 9 year old son: "So these are like Planet Earth, but funny?" Yes.
thank you for tonight's nightmare
I honestly missed you so much
Mosquito lore 😳
I still want all mosquitos dead
How about "true facts about humans"
getting my trypophobia triggered is always worth it for Ze Frank <3
*watching this made my skin itch and now I have a sudden urge to observe the air for ay little black dots floating around so I may destroy them..*
This video made my skin and brain feels itchy… h O w??!
The number 1 annoying insect when it comes to a bite
17 minutes!! We are treated well <3
非常牛叉的视频！犀利的镜头，全程展现蚊子的前所未见的细节！
This makes me uncomfy
So if we killed all the mosquitos, flowers might die? *sigh* Fine.
To be fair, I saw that first mosquito hatching on the water surface scene in a beloved documentary about carnivorous plants which I bought on VHS as a child. There they had underlain it with some mystical music, and, long story short, the scene blew my kid mind with the awe of nature back then.
0:41 Bruh I literally just came from the kitchen with a bagel what the–
I now have a deeper appreciation and greater sense of repulsion for mosquitoes. Well done!
I don't know but you but is annoying as a talking animal would be you'd be rich so you have to do is go on a live stream have things standing next to you go to a full view of the room spinning around the camera slowly showing that there's nothing else in there like no voice boxes nothing and you'll be able to see that that is just the talking animal haven't walked down the street while you're doing it to have people go what the f*** is that the thing is talking
13:31 - 13:37 well I'm not paying any child support.
I hate them with passion, slapped monitor few time for good measure!
Jerry is like "that guy" everyone has in there office, who is always in the lunch room...
Every time I get bitten I pray to god I dont die!
The Lady Gaga joke was my fave.
"17 minutes long"  Oh this is going to be good!
Never forget that the name mosquito implies the presence of a single larger Mosco
Beautiful.
The humble zefrank subscriber waits patiently in the glum of society for the elusive zefrank to make his once in a blue moon upload about yet another magnificently odd animal that we already know of but nothing about, and when he does upload, the humble subscriber rushes to watch it in all its glory savouring it for no longer than its duration only to wait, patiently for the next fix .... of Zefrank❤
Looks like a toe biter or water bug. 3:09
This is one of your best videos, loved it to bits
Virgin Bloodsucking Mosquitoes vs. Chad Mosquito baby eating Elephant Mosquitoes
3:07 So the cursed one has come to make an appearance. Be careful with what you do now, your life is on the line.
I love you Ze!  I've been a fan ever since The Show!
Wow. Finally a new video.🤪
the shortest 17 min video i have ever watched
Oh god, this was REALLY hard to watch ... there's so many damn skeeters around here that this actually hurt.  Cause I can't NOT get bit and now I can't help thinking about those damn mouth parts and mosquito saliva ... why would you do this to me?
Grrr, so we meet again, Mr. mosquito. You wouldn´t believe how unpleasant they can make my nightshift. Even more unplesant than the shift itself!
though you're gonna say not mouth hole but a**hole 🤣
I always have felt bad for killing mosquitos.
Interesting
this is the itchiest thing I've ever seen.
No, all of you mosquitos can get out Go on get out of here Not you elephant, you can stay
Thank you for this! They are beautiful and fascinating, all creatures are really when people pay attention to them💙🌈💙
You just made my birthday 10 times better Thank you for all that you do
This is the only animal I will ever say this about, but  KILL THEM ALL
I was hoping you'd cover the most important study of Mosqueoitos; They can get drunk from drinking blood thus exploding from being such bloodoholics
Man. How did I miss this for an HOUR?!?!?!?
Im itchy all over now.
Great video gift for the Birthday.  It helped the day suck a little less. Not that it did suck but any less sucking of the blood variety is always a good thing.
Am I wrong, or does the phrase "a series of tubes" show up in multiple of ze-videos?
"And now it's getting dicked by a skeeter" Best thing I've heard all day 🤣🤣🤣
When I see that Zfrank is uploading a new video it makes a huge smile appear instantly on my face!!!!!!!
2:11 Demon Babe 😆
I love this!
I'm suddenly very itchy
im scared to click on these videos ever since the dic- uh- i mean tick video.
So what you're saying is that I need to get like a million elephant mosquito eggs, and then go around putting them in all the stagnant water I can find
Great stuff even though I'm totally allergic to mosquitoes... they are the bane of my life.
*Tiny thingy penetrating and moving anxiously quickly* Zefrank: This looks like the inside view of a teddy bear being humped by a chihuahua
👏🏿🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟🦟
And on the same day they announced a Malaria vaccine!
Snofalofagus reimagined as dildo wearing glasses
Learning that Mosquitoes are pollinators and in the diet of a massive amount of animals and insects definitely explains why Gates wants to wipe them out completely.
More seriously, what are mosquitoes good for? Feeding literally anything else. If mosquitoes were to disappear, a massive part of the ecosystem would go along with it.
Insta Like, its going to be good 101% Edit: so good that I did not skip the sponsor part, no regrets.
Got itchy just watching this.
As of October 6th, 2021, the WHO has recognized a vaccine against malaria! It's the first vaccine EVER against a human parasite and has been the result of over 100 years of human research! The current one is 30% effective, but another one in trial is showing promises of 77% effectivity against the parasite!!!
Omg...sooo gud. Thanks man
I absolutely love zefrank videos .. 😊
Stopped whatever I was watching and clicked fast.  One of 2 channels maybe I’ll do that.
Sorry but if you are a plant that can’t survive without mosquito pollination then I think you should go extinct along with them
i never thought that i would have a positive opinion on mosquitos
Ah, yes, such a beautiful mosquito life... That often ends splattered on my wall.
The only things I miss in your videos, it's french translaction for the people around me who can't understand english at all. I need to make it myself one day, because it's so good and I always learn something I didn't know even for the animals I think I know. Sorry for my bad english and thanks for this new video, I just discovered I can love one mosquito know. Because one of them just eat sugar and eat other. It's like wow, my new totem! :D
🐃🐂Video idea: cows! Ruminant stomachs with their microbes, how milk is 'made' in a 4-quarter udder, turning from a one-stomach suckling calf to a four-stomach ruminant (there is research how both grain and hay affect the rumen differently), freemartinism with twin calves, artificial insemination, extinct Aurochs in Rewilding Europe project...
*Hellloooo!!*
Here comes ZeFrank to save the day!! Hello!!!🐝❤️🤗
3:07 I'm no entomologist, but I do believe that is a giant water bug
I LOVE WHAT YOU DO. 💜
This is the only series that I can watch at 3 AM before an exam and not feel guilty.
I fell and sprained my elbow today.  This meant I got to stay home and watch this so…z’all good.
10:15 that is karma
OMG, it's so hard to learn something while I suffocate with a fit of laughter every 20 seconds. 😹😹😹
2:11 "Demon baby"
Still the best channel in this godforsaken site
mosquito's can pollinate? Well I want to murder them slightly less now
I HATE mosquitoes with all my heart, but I’m also fascinated by how complicated they are! And as a mechatronics/robotics engineer I’m in awe at how complex these creatures are while also being so tiny! Nature is amazing!
*THE GREAT ONF RETURNS!!!*
zefrank!!
3:09 a toe biter/Mexican water bug. They earn their nickname.
Yoooooooo!!!! Back at it again!!!
i think zefrank is a vampire, first the video on ticks and now a video on mosquito. he be acting sus
I’m conflicted. I want to like the video because I love this channel, but I hate mosquitoes with a passion😂
Best video about the worst animal
I love this man's wit!   I wish Zefrank would do one on President Joe Biden , The Biden come from the family known as " Dementiacratus  particum" the fastest growing species of Homo sapiens known to possess the smallest brain who eats, breathes, and poops from the same orifice where they make beabies !      I think it would be a hoot!
i love your videos, thank you
Mosquito says hello was petty good, but it's no koala in the rain, no fucks given....
That was an amazing intro.
Oh he’s changed microphones hell yeah
I don't think the world would ever be ready for Zefrank's "search" history. In this video alone, there's frog watersports and that's not normal. It's not right? I saw it, now I'm stuck with it in my head..
Zefrank man you always make learning fun I had lot of laugh with this vids 😀😘
Jerry's question at the end leads to an interesting bit of mosquito trivia. The genus of mosquitoes that spreads malaria is called Anopheles, and the name comes from the prefix "an-" meaning "no" or "not" (like in "anarchy") and the noun "ophelos," meaning "benefit," "good" (in the noun sense, like "the public good"), or "profit" (in the financial sense). So, in a way, NGOs fighting malaria are all nonprofits engaged in a battle against a mosquito that is literally named "nonprofit"!
A song from zefrank! A blessing!
I too, look like a depressed ghost :(
I love his videos so much it great!!
Truly despicable creatures
These videos give me life, I'm glad I found them
Th only fact that matters is that they should all die. F Mosquitoes. Seriously, F 'em.
You gotta watch true facts on the toliet. You gain while losing.
I'm watching this to better understand my mortal enemy
My favorite word: the byerbs
The Most Dangerous Animal Ever!
About time we talk about the females that suck your life juice... Also mosquitoes
I was bitten by a mosquitoe today for the first time this season, I hate them more than the word moist
A new video from zefrank is like an unexpected meeting with an old friend.
nearly 20 min?  Ive been looking forward to this
Looking forward to  True facts: the YouTube viewer
Elephan mosquitos are true heroes as far as I am concerned
🦟🥣😜  "it's like slurping a soup through a mustache"
HELLLLOOOO
It's always a good day when we get to enjoy another True Facts video! As hilarious and educational as always!
Has there been any research on feeding multiple generations from the same source? If my blood is used for their eggs and their eggs and their eggs and their eggs... Like how much of my me is left in one egg? (Heh)
Nobody: Elephant mosquito: HELLO!!!
I am battling one at the moment. Nice
Crazy that there’s people out there doing incredibly detailed analysis on mosquitos
I asked for this video once I remember
True facts is a redundancy.
Excellent video although I hate mosquitoes. Now they gross me out more than ever.
life came from a butt - sun tzu
The mosquitos are the Finnish airforce.
"butt first, im mean but first "always makes me laugh
I love how professional his narrating is while he cracks jokes at the same time. Never gets old.
Pass the aux:   Mosquito says hello
so what you're telling me is the best way to not get bitten by mosquito's is to stop breathing xD
I think most life on this planet agree all mosquitoes, except those who don’t drink blood should be made extinct?
What kind of camera and lens do they use for these things?
12:50 fun fact: mosquitos have caused roughly 10% of human deaths in *history*. Yes, that's correct. Some believe the number is as low as 5%, others as much as 50%. They are also the only animal that we as humans have specifically evolved and adapted to combat, at least from an evolutionary standpoint.
Lesson learned: if you ask what something is good for, you're going to get one very annoying talking chicken
Just watching this made me itchy
"DEMON BABY" 🤣
Holy crap zefrank is back...hold my beer...
This video made me itch
This has helped me hate them more😑
I used to hate all mosquitoes but Zefrank made me like those elephant mosquitoes. HELLO!
When you realize you are involuntary a parent to a few thousand mosquitos.
This is better than a documentary!
butt first... i mean but first! 🤣
The ONLY channel that can make me close my eyes  &  turn away from the images, while laughing the entire time!!  Once I started smiling, it lasted the whole video!  Thank You ZeFrank!!! ❤      😄 I needed that 😄
Over 17 minutes? Hell yeah!
Almost felt sorry for the larvae that gets eaten...then the itch begins anew and well, that's just karma because their mom decided to be a bitch to the human feeding her
I wish zefrank1 could post more. Love his videos. Should do one on elephants. Or hyenas
Don't care. I'll take butterflies for pollination. These mother fuckers gotta go.
Oh how I've missed you 🤣😂 Thank you for the laughs and facts 🤗
Dale...Dale... WTF
Butt first. That's how zefrank viewers do.
As always, this was beautifull!!
There is nary a being (or type of being) I hate more than mosquitos. Squish em all! Burn the water they hatch in. I hate them I hate them I hate them Ooh, I learned something. I like the elephant thingy. It kills the biters and doesn't bite itself. They are allowed to live now
I finally here early
I don't care if they're pollinators, they deserve to go extinct
... now I'm itchy
To all the ppl came to watch this vid 6:40
"Hel~looo!!"
I always wondered what they were good for other then frog food now I know they pollinate makes since
I did not know they were pollinators.
Already 1k comments.
Oh yeah, warn us this time about the holes but that frog video is still out there... Waiting...
You've made some pretty indepth videos about some objectively gross creepy crawlies before. I guess its a true testament to my unadulterated hatred of Mosquitoes that this is the first time I've ever been truly disgusted and had to fight hard to finish the video.
I love how you can hear his smile in his narration haha
Please do something about animals! I can't watch bugs. They scare me
Shookening
People often laugh when I tell I'm afraid of mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are harmless, they say. Sure, so are most spiders and yet arachnophobia exist. Sure, then let's do a thought experiment: let's say You are afraid of spiders. Then imagine them with wings and their food: YOU! And they like to fly in swarms...! Its nightmare-fuel and probably inspiration to Steven Kings next book 😱🤡 Not to mention all the diseases!! 😵
Mosquitoes that feed on humans should be driven extinct. I don't care if they polinate. Theres plenty of other polinator species out there.
Heeeee's Baaaaack!
Wow I didn't think I could hate mosquitoes more than I already did
HELLO!!!!
2:09
"Otherwise known as mOsKaWiToEs" 😂
The mosquitos in central pa are worse than they have been for a long time. Tea tree oil mixed with some  coconut oil are great for repellant.
Mosquitos, I hate all of them.
"and people are very good at killing people!" 😂
*Demon Bebeh*   😂
mosquitoes in video : heLLO  mosquitoes in my fucking room : 👂🦟
That indeed triggered to my trypophobia thanks lol
I still remember when you came back from your hiatus, this is still the best series on YouTube.
This is funny...  But I it's going to be really hard to ever top "Like finding a f#€√ flavored Doritos in the couch cushions."
like straining soup through a mustaeche xD i love this xD
9:39 so hard to watch as the mosquito literally bites that poor bird in the eye !
This show is good to watch while eating
This is the most informative video about mosquitos I haver seen
I genuinely love how this YouTube Channel is more entertaining and informative than Discovery has been for a decade
Frank is very good about crediting is sources and giving thanks to the scientists who provide the footage. Question: Do you think those scientists watch frank's videos and get as much entertainment out of them as we do?  Cheers
The random video of a frog micturating on another frog was a pleasant surprise.
Please stop it with the insects, do some animal that isn't gross
When Zefrank posts u know its gonna be a good day. With an awesome song at the end of the video! U have made me like many an animal. However, mosquitos will never be one of them!
9:14 HAHAHA!!
Mosquitoes 🦟...The one animal I will not miss if it became extinct.
Mosquitoes are the actual spawn of Satan. You kill one and somehow 50 more of them pop up. You wake up with 100 bites and just think “I though I got rid of that stupid devil”
Ah mosquitos. Natures lot lizards
I am late by an hour because I had to get off the train, walk 3 blocks, climb 2 floors, lock the door and lay down on my couch. That's how I doo.
Dude comes back like it's nothing
Elephant Mosquito supremacy.
Haha I was watching Charlotte Dobre and suddenly I thought of you and here you have just posted! Amazing!  Haha Johnstone and his tiny Johnson!
🤣🤣🤣🦟 gonna have this song stuck in my head all week, not mad about it!
"Hellooo"
Thank you, I needed this knowledge for my species extermination plan
Never breathe on a mosquito…. Got it….
Oh yay a new zefrank video. I'm in the hospital so this is nice
I chose a terrible video to watch while eating my sushi
These videos take a while but they are dffinatly worth it
Killing it man. Always good stuff.
Did he just say dicked by a skeeter?
Philadelphia
Yeah, I know those little bloodsuckers are environmentally important. I don't care - any mosquito wench trying to make bebehs out of my blood gets smacked.
Was hoping more roasts
That's a great episode. I can't wait to go home and blaze up and watch it again
Not yet see it but the only fact that it is  about one of my favorite animal make me instalike this video
The unidentified larvae eating mosquito larvae was a giant water bug. They are known to be voracious and take down things as large as frogs.
HELLO!!!! I laughed way too much from this
"Ma-squee-toes"
insects are terrifying
If up-close mosquitoes make you uncomfortable, here's a pick-me-up: after a hundred years of research, a successful vaccine for malaria was approved by the World Health Organization just a few days ago, on October 7th - the first of its kind for any parasitic disease!
Look it's Bill Gates best friend
26 people wish they could breathe out of their butt hole.
Great, my curiosity landed me some fresh material for my nightmares 😂🤣🥲
Best one yet, did infact laugh out loud. would recommend getting into it buttfirst asap.
Now I have to think at least 17 min before smacking a mosquito.
"Do mosquitos feels pain"  "God I hope so"
*preparing to set all surfaces of water on fire*🔥🔥
I like how you just KNOW what’s the joke that’s gonna make everyone giggle and “Grow Up”
*sees this in my rec* Oh hell XD.
So the first stage in Spore is amazingly accurate! Wow
since mosquito bébés have some of my dna in them does this mean my family cant ask me to give them grandchildren anymore? for context i live in a tropical country constantly fighting for my life against these gotdam vampires
"Gettin' dicked by a 'squiter" - Ah yes, the most 'Merica way to state how unfortunate the earbud is at 9:14
Best one yet, did infact laugh out loud. would recommend getting into it buttfirst asap.
"That's magic right there. It's like pulling a rabbit out of a hat.  Um, if the hat was your butt and the rabbit was a Tic-Tac."  Zefrank, your analogies are perfect.
The first part was Hilarious 😂😂🤣
Heheheh
zefrank knows about trypophobia    oh great im really starting to go shaky
Mosquitoes are a great example of how the curse of Genesis 3 played out
Would a slight application of a biodegradable oil prevent those larvae from breathing, and thus cut down on mosquito populations?
Mosquitos, the one species that deserve total extermination
14:28  (Remembers there was a damn mosquito flying around the coffee machine... Goes and cleans the whole thing...)
Comments like the "chihuahua / teddy bear" comparison really makes me worry about zefrank1's private life activities...
Id love to GMO myself to have a natural pesticide.   Skeeter bites me, it dies.
Frickin heck I despise mosquitoes. But the depressed ghost bit did get a chuckle out of me, I'll admit.
Thanks for the birthday present
pupaté
I was just crying from yaoi and now ZEFRANK UPLOADED I'm blessed
Please don't take long updating a new video.  Love it
That "thing" you showed is a Giant Water Bug, more commonly known as the "Toe Biter."  I hope one day you will do a video on those bastards.
I really tried not to, but I ended up learning something in this video.
Hey zefrank1 please make a video about Tiger Beetle. I love those speed demons.
hellLOOOOOO
I can already feel my skin itching before watching this.
"Hellooooooo!"
You should’ve also talked about the mosquito extinction programs that scientists are researching right now, including by CRISPR gene drives and mosquito STDs
Best video yet
😊Lovely song at the end, Zefrank👍💜
Can you please do a video about the human?
watching this while being harassed by mosquitoes
Brilliant as always :)  Many thanks!
Okay. I trusted you. Went to get food, and I regretted it. Somewhat because I'm eating cold eggrolls I forgot to put in the fridge last night, but also cause of the extensive coverage on buttholes.
15:33 they look like rice grains
I feel getting bitten by a mosquito while watching this
I m trying to be respectfull to all kind of life, and not even killing a single fly… but god mosquitos sometimes realy testing me if ı have will to keep my promise or not >:/
ZeFrank really missed a golden opportunity to give the f'n mosquito all the sarcastic rage these little cocksuckers deserve.
heLLO!
Who decided that "learn to think" was a good company slogan? I thought it was another one of your jokes 😂
I was fine with the video until after the sponsorship.... that is when I started to shudder, which I am rather proud of cuz God damn do I hate squeeterz
Dang, now I have to think twice before swatting one....
0:16 Hit this and use the skip 10 seconds thing and it be a cool jump cut of emerging
You should do one about the Florida no-see-ums, its mouth bits are freaky
Sees new video *massive inhale* YES. So glad I didn't jump out that window last week when I was feeling like shit. I would have missed your new upload
Thank you 😊
Another true fact! I'm gonna kill every single mosquito i see for the rest of my life :)
ah neat
"There are flowers only the mosquito can pollinate" Oh so I'm supposed to care about mosquitoes now??
this video has made me want to keep elephant mosquitoes as pets
I would exterminate all of their kind except that giant variant that stays the fuck away from my tissue.  Something about them casually destroying my blood vessels and pumping deadly pathogens into my system is literally something out of satan´s literature.
Transformation from larva to adult looks straight up like a vampire waking up from a long rest.
“Dale?” What happened to Jerry? Oh good, Jerry is there too!
They go through all this just to get dealt with by my HAND 🖐🏾
Banana
Babby mosquitos are not like a huge truck you can dump things on. They are a series of tubes.
butt first
So the mosquitos aren't to blame...damn stuff piggybacking inside em is to blame
I lost it at "It's mosquitoes all the way down."  😂
Everytime zefrank makes a post, I race to the bathroom at work to watch it.
I thought this day would never come :P
Getting dicked by a 'skeeter...lmao.  Best of his videos so far!
The main thing I've learned from True Facts is that a shockingly large amount of creatures breathe through their butt
One day I will own mosquito disco pants...HELLOOO
"Getting dicked by a skeeter."  Dude. I was eating. I almost choked on my chicke...wait...
Idc if it has a "beautiful" life imma still smash it
Ok I dig the mosquitos song
didn’t know they were pollinators until now, i thought they were annoyingly useless lol
Sports racer here. I have continued to racing sports
This isn't a full fledged site...it's a para-site.  I'll see myself out.
True facts about BiggAss rodents
Damn things. The only good thing about mosquitos and their larvae is food for something else.
Load up YouTube, see Zefrank video. Yeeeeee  I didn't know this was gonna be a badass day!!  Fuck work. I'm watching right now. That's how the gerret Do.
Key thing to take out of this video, wear a mask to hide your mouth hole. Mosquito can’t find you now.
Hello!  ~Mos Quito
I waited for so long to finally hear your majestic commentary.
"and now it's getting dicked by a skeeter."  Best sentence ever
dont forget this insanely smart dude made a operation on a teddy...i prefer these fact videos since i learn alot
Well that thing you didn't want to Google is a water scorpion they are mostly harmless but can bite like a bitch we used to have them in my local creek us kids only knew of them cause we used to play around in the creek with empty flower pots as traps for them got bitten too many times
0:13 masquito appearing reminds me of evangelion angel
Yeeeee🤙 he back with the dildooo-metaphors!!! Love it<3
I came looking for information to better destroy my enemies, and instead found an ally. Toxorhynchites are the chosen ones and we should attach an egg minigun to it and some anti air armor.
I will never not laugh at "butt first."
Amazing! Something I wanted to learn for a long time!
You know the classic excuse to any hate "pest" animals get?  Y'know.. the "Oh well they have an important job in the ecosystem!"  Like how Spiders kill bad bugs, ants clean up dead bodies etc.   Yeah.. Mosquitos don't have an excuse.. they just suck..
Elephant mosquitoes need to be protected. They're so useful for the environment.
Golly I hate mosquitoes
dude, i love killing mosquitoes with my electric swatter when they are mating mid-air. it’s like killing your enemy while it’s enjoying life and having sex and hoping to continue it’s generation. the perfect revenge.
You're telling me that mosquitoes help the environment??? No 😭😭 I wanted to continue on hating them because they're useless to the food chain 😒
Elephant mosquitoes are literally built different.
True fact : A mosquito is stronger than One Punch, man
Now I itch
I KNEW that was a mosquito! Creepy lil fkrs!
When we inevitably sterilize all the mosquitoes, let's leave the elephant mosquitos alone. They didn't do anything wrong.
Is it wrong to say i need more videos? Your jokes are dead on funny.
6:00 Ahh, finally, someone is mentioning that they are nectar feeders.  Next, I imagine some commentary about it being only females that drink blood, and only for nurturing young?  I hope so.  I'm tired of being the guy who mentions it when people speak of eradicating the species.  We just need more smaller bat colonies, that will naturally control the population while avoiding the disease you get from small numbers of larger bat colonies.  OOps, went off topic, but anyway, yeah, I'm going to resume.  My guess on the critter in his teaser was pretty close.  I said larva, and it was a pupa.
The hatching made me squirm >·<
Finally addressing humanity's ultimate foe.
"Like one time he said 'boob' by mistake. Now everyone laughed at him" 😂😂😂😂
Very informative and funny
I was kinda worried at the beginning. I thought Frank has replaced Jerry with Dale. Glad Jerry is still with us.
I have a fan in my room to disturb that plume.
15:52 Jerry asks a legitimate question that's been plaguing mankind for generations, but gets a funny chicken metaphor as a response...𝙗𝙍𝙪𝙃
*"Butt first."* You don't say.
A new episode? I am blessed.
Biggest pieces of shit on the whole Earth, the only living beings I wish went extinct
“Johnston’s organ can sense the slightest movement— oh grow up”  😂🤣🤣🤣
His voice sounds different?
MOS-QUO-ITOS...lmao   please make that a shirt. I'll buy 2
nice
thanks I tried this at my local pool and all I got was a date and a sore ass. Not good advice.
Okay so when are we going to get a zefrank and hood nature collab cause...
Where you even bud
Words cannot describe my excitement
Nobody: The doctor when I was born (2:11): *D E M O N B E B B Y*
I got the creepy crawly tingles watching this. educational ASMR at its best
Ze Frank uploaded?!? Yes I will drop everything else to watch this!
My appreciation for mosquitoes has grown tenfold this day. Stil gonna swat 'em, but it's an improvement!
Aaaaah my tripophobiaaaa
MALARIA Dengue Fever Zika  Toxorhynchites: "HELLO!"
The way he says bebe is something
Dude how are these always so damn funny
High tire visuals
DEMON BABY
9:14 That is not a phrase I expected to ever hear in my life but there's a first time for everything
"HELLO!"  *wheezing 🤣🤣🤣
I regret I have but one like to give 😂
This has to be one of your best videos yet.  Too bad I was eating lunch when the video veered into the raft making mosquito mommies. Erf!!  Gross!!  Still, fascinating.  Thanks.
man it’s my lucky day I get to learn some true facts from my favorite all knowing being.
Elephant Mosquitos are my favorite Mosquitos by a mile.
HELLOOOO
They suck.
Love it! Thanks
Elephant mosquitoes are now my favorite (partly) carnivorous insects.
I was warned, I did not listen, I regret not getting a nice pimento bagel.
another amazing true facts video by the one and only zefrank1
This is still one of my favorite Series on Youtbe. Keep doing the best you can!. :D
"No mother is perfect, I mean who hasn't lost a child or two at the waterpark"😄
Such a smart way to bring a smile to my day.
Awsome
mosquitos are 3d printed out of the water change my mind
I love how he says "Mosquito *bæbæs*"
damn I think I just had a Grinch moment and my heart grew a couple sizes for mosquitoes. I didn't realize they weren't all bad apples 🥺 some of dem even kinda cute
Wait, I thought only bees pollinate flowers. And without bees, flowers and plants would die because no pollination.
getting ready for 420 “suck” related jokes
Butt first, sorry, i mean but first 😂. I like how there is one of these in most of your vids
Well I wanna watch this but I about threw up at the beginning so thats fun.
I didn't even know Mosquitos could pollinate. Everything has it's place in nature it seems, even those we deem more harmful than good.
Children in Ethiopia are starving
I didn't know that male moskitos pollinate flowers - learning something interesting from Zefrank every time 💐😘 thanks, mate !
also to note, a good answer to what mosquitoes are 'good for' if you REALLY need to justify it to yourself:  Mosquitoes play a vital part in the food web, their sheer numbers and the speed of which they reproduce and mature ensure that MANY species, from insects, to fish, frogs, spiders, even birds and small mammals have an ensured direct food source, and the animals that feed on said mosquitoes in large numbers in turn also are consumed by larger animals.  not to mention, when they consume blood from other, far larger animals, theyre recycling nutrients from a creature they would be locked in, potentially for YEARS, back into the food web
the things you've made me imagine today will never go away.  haha thank you!
I missed you! Makes me so excited to see you uploaded a new video!
thank you for the suggestion snacking on olives made a delightful accompaniment to this video
The best way to watch the videos on this channel is on mute.
Happy birthday!
True genius . More information and wit packed into a few minutes than hrs of class. Almost feel guilty for not taking notes. And I've been out of school for almost 40yrs. Always good to learn new things. It's great when people like ZeFrank make it's easy and enjoyable.  Great job as always. 👍👍
I fking love how he explains everything. It makes the video hilarious as f but also much much more fun and that makes me enjoy and understand it easier. XD
Holy shit this is a long video for ZeFrank
Blood sucking insects. Words can't describe my hatred.  Make them extinct now!
i didn't expect this video to be the funniest video i'd have seen today
Now I'm itchy
So can we all agree that mosquitos serve no purpose in the cosmos beside population control?
This guy is so funny. His serious voice mixed with immature humor. Love it. David Attenborough has nothing on zefrank1
I wonder if there's anything we can do to encourage the population growth of the mosquitoes that eat other mosquitoes and don't suck blood.
Eewww... Mosqui... Wait, rewind that, let me see it again!
Welp, now I have two songs stuck in my head....one about mosquitos and ones about boobies.
OMG I’VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH THE SWARM OF MOSQUITOES IN MY ROOM LATELY, AND THEN THIS VIDEO COMES UP THIS IS BLACK MAGIC
"Now it's getting dicked by a skeeter" Come for the comedy, stay for the learning.
I'd like to beg to differ for a sec...I dont think the ones biting me have that great of flight bc they always get stuck in my hair while not flying that great near my ears making me even more annoyed by their sound.
Demon BEHBEY
Release the song!
The Gods have blessed me
The depths of my hatred for mosquitoes run even deeper than I thought if even ZeFrank can’t make me like them
VIDEO CHALLENGE: Don't scratch at all while watching this video.
How dare you make me care about mosquitoes.
I was about to sleep and thankfully this showed up
- "grow up"  - no
True Facts about Me regarding Mosquitoes: "F**k Them.
*Immediately likes*
Talk about chicken?
i repeated that intro 15 times🤣🤣
How dare you validate their existence by telling us they pollinate!
Epic
I still hate them.
Ok, I admit, I hate mosquitoes a little bit less now. Still don't like the ones that feed on people.
Termites would be a neat episode someday
I fucking love this channel
“Dicked by a skitter” 🤣 🤣 🤣
Hahaha learn to think. ;D
HES STILL GOING??? I REMEMBER YOU FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
What timing. There’s a mosquito outbreak near my place in LA right now. 🤣
10:23 hmmm is so that mosquito's pee tho?
This channel is fantastic!!.
I love this man
LOL
Those mosquitoes coming out of the water have a very real Dracula vibe actually.
OMG! I’m only 6 seconds in and I’m so giddy with anticipation I had to post this comment!
Omg........ I have been waiting for sooooo long
Like all of yours, my mind was blown only by notification from zefrank.
all of my sensory organ are now in VERY ALERT because now im actually cautious from all mosquitos around me
Oh shoot. Those weren’t tadpoles in that trash can lid…
So wait..... if the honey bees die off...... we'll have wasps AND mosquitoes Taking over for pollination *I want off this fucking ride*
Wow. This has really amazing footage. Humor and educational. Great!
Wooo he's alive
Well I left this still hating these terrifying monsters. Just even more creeped out.  Also…”Dale! Dale do something!”
This just made my month! “ A depressed ghost” 🤣 🤣
I went from Loving You to calling you a traitor for trying to justify mosquitoes to... understanding, accepting okay I'm back love you man. LOL
Ever since... _then_ Whenever I try to sleep, I hear the buzzing. The sounds come in my ear, but when I look, nothing is there. I can't sleep, only lay there hoping *it* goes away. You may think demons aren't real, but they're everywhere. In your house. In your backyard. Drinking your life essence to survive... sometimes I question if they are truly evil... But when they come near, those thoughts quickly vanish. *They want my blood.*  The way they enter this world, their forms slowly rising from below, like the demon they are, newly summoned from a ritual. Also, uh... only the females are bad. Who cares if they need blood for a *b a b b y* or out of a need for food, anyway.
I am spanish. The fact that he pronounced Ibiza absolutely right amazed me more than the bushy bushy and twisty twisty thingies.
He said "grow up" to himself to stop from laughing.
... "D!cked by a Skeeter" is *not* what I was expecting to hear when I woke up this morning.  I love it.
So we dont need to get rid of all the mosquitoes, only 5% of them that can transmit fatal diseases to humans? Then what the fuck are we waiting to get rid of them?
i hate that nature just creates this little peice of shit bug that only lives for like a week and all it dose is irritate LITERALLY everything ells alive on the planet, spread diseases, makes a bunch more of itself and then just fucking dies....its like a scaled up virus. fuck those things, i hope we figure out how to genetically manipulate them into being sterile.
Men don't grow up. We just get bigger.
Let’s goooooooooooooo another episode ✨🔥 love ya Frank
Making my COVID diagnosis more bearable.
Finally an interesting video about mosquitos. An even better its a zefrank video
My friend thought they were raising tadpoles but they turned out to be mosquito larvae
Ah perfect timing, woke up with 7 mosquito bites couple days ago.
Still waiting for a collaboration between you and TierZoo.
Im so itchy rn
The wait for a new vid is over. Worth it.
HELLOOOOO!
There's something very satisfying about watching the larva raft be built.
Ha! Love it
Here before a million views....35k to be exact
0:58 cursed corn
*”Mos-CO-Wee-Toes”*
Glad you're back.....just wish it wasn't this.
All mosquitoes MUST DIE! They are eeeeeeevil!
“To defeat an enemy, you must know them. Not simply their battle tactics, but their history, philosophy, art.”
this channel shouldn't hold off we all want something new every week!!!
"B A B E H"
This episode made me itchy
I couldnt finish the video! AAAAAH mosquito larva is freaky!!!!$
There is a weird class of offbrand that involve insects... just pretend you didn't read that...
Dammit. Now I care about mosquitoes... Fuck.
My dad is totally blind and has been since his thirties. He can't see a darn thing. Late one summer, we were outside and I turned to look at him and there was a mosquito... ON HIS EYEBALL. Literally sitting ON HIS EYE, and he COULDN'T FEEL IT. That right there is the creepiest thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
Watching this in the dark, occasionally slapping mosquitos, is just perfect. Painful and annoying, with a chance of getting malaria, but perfect.
One of nature’s most annoying creatures Hate these things
Now I don't wanna look down upon the little guys with the standard human superiority complex, but this is about as horrifying as I thought it would be...
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH, ... A NEW VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!   Gosh I need a life, ... lol.
Nah friend. I still hate them bastards. Ill start liking them when they dont need blood to live.
🗨🐤
3:08 that insect is know as a Toe bitter. They live in swamps and lakes where they swim underwater and use their mouth to pierce right into the flesh of another insect…..or your toe. It hurts like hell.
Literally was just complaining about mosquitoes in my head while walking my dog
all i wanted was for him to say mo-skwee-to and i got my wish.
YESSS I BEEN WAITING FOR ANOTHER ONE OF THESE VIDEOS
POV: You’re here from the Teddy has an operation video that you somehow got in the recommendations list after almost a decade.
Your videos are such a crazy combination of humor and actual interesting facts about the critters you're covering, I love it!  Always look forward to new videos from you!
Thank you!
Okay, but what is the best way to kill them?
Holy crap.   They're even worse than I thought.
So skeletor wasn't joking afterall
me: what a fascinating episode my instinct: reaching for the slipper
Donate Blood and Save Mosquitoes 🙏
They are sent directly from hell I decided. Oh this isn't Ryan Chanel sorry.
There was 1 part he missed in this video how long do these fkers live fir
fml this had me rolling lol
17 minutes YES!!!! Let’s all hate on the mosquitos for as long as we can!!!!
I love Ze's videos, but the whole "mosquitoes have killed more people than even people" is actually a misrepresentation. All studies done on it have shown murders per capita and did not count for suicides, gang killings, car accidents, general accidents where one human kills another, etc.
I have the urge to hit my phone screen throughout the video, is that normal?
I came for the intricate biology, similes and not so intricate jokes. I wasn't dissapointed.
Sooooo happy for a new video!!!!  You’re the best!
This is the news I needed today! New nature video!
4:41 Me: Finally, i got my paycheck! I can spend it on everything! The irs:
HAPPY DANCE 🩰 !! 💜💚💙🥰 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR POSTING AGAIN 🎃
I live next to a swamp I have to deal with these things was to often
mosquito's are good for fud, not for humans, but for a lot of other things.  there's less than 5 species of mosquito's that  bite humans. there's several efforts ongoing to wipe those out while leaving the rest to feed the rest of the food chain as usual.
It's nice to know that there's mosquitos that don't drink blood, but eat other mosquitos and polinate. One species isn't useless
When's the mosquito song dropping?
MOSQUITOES CAN AND WILL SMELL YOUR FEET
This is the most horrifying episode you’ve ever made. Also, now I want to find elephant mosquito eggs online, so they can kill the other ones before they take flight. Fucking mosquitoes.
In this house we love and respect the Elephant Mosquito.
So the Elephant Mosquito is the only good one? Got it
Mosquitoes are the bane of existence…
I find this video very uncomfortable to watch. I had to stop without reaching the end.
Ew the thing that he "didnt know what it was" eating the larva at like 3:15 is what's lovingly(not) called a toe biter in the south. It's a water beetle with a really fuckin painful bite from that proboscis
Definitely worth the wait.
Getting eaten alive by mosquitoes rn ama
No way. Master has returned
I like toxorhynchites too.
I hate mosquitoes so much that I’ll leave Daddy Long-legs alive because they feed on mosquitoes. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
A mosquito stops sucking once you slap it... you know the rest of the joke.
watching this while getting bitten by mosquitoes at 1am
Getting eaten butt first does seem like a terrible way to die
That shot of the mosquito stinging a human made me really uncomfortable. Imagine you have to sit still while a mosquito sits on your arm. Would drive me crazy.
Not a fan of ze’mosquito, and that’s just how I dooo…
Jesus, 17 minutes? Alright, I'll get cozy.
TIL What mosquitos are good for.
Mosquitoes like feet.....just when you thought they couldn't get any more cursed.
Emerges a little bit more like “helLO!!” Really fucking sent me omfg 😂😂😂
No effin wonder mosquitos are so agressive, they all ha PTSD from the sh*t they been through in kindergarden!
Funny that this is posted soon after news about the malaria vaccine
When I see a dirty little puddle full of baby mosquitoes I gladly pour a cup of bleach right into it. The only living creature I would exterminate with a smile on my face
RETURN OF THE KING
can we get a collaboration with bibliaridon?
2:25 Volvox
“  like one time he said boob and now everyone laughs at him…”…😂✌️😂
U should do panda bebes
I hate mosquitos. Now I hate them a little more. Lol
Ya
46 minutes after posting. I am not smart enough to make a joke
I've not even started the video yet but there's no way in hell you'll make me appreciate those blood-sucking pieces of shit demon spawn
Yes, you can actually breath through your butt. The lining inside it is thin enough that oxygen can penetrate it and enter the blood stream.
Fun fact: In Jurassic Park the mosquito shown in amber is an elephant mosquito
I’m allergic to a certain type of mosquito bite.  Naturally, this video is my nightmare fuel.
he-LLOOO :D
"DEMON BABY"
I have been blessing with less tasty blood. So my family and everyone else around me get bitten like a toddlers teething ring meanwhile I’m doing my own thing unaffected
My skin was crawling throughout this whole video
Anyone else feel squirmy the whole time?
Brilliant, hilarious and informative ✌️🍻
Took u long enough man
Nice Dragonfly larva cameo.
fun fact: mosquito larvae are edible, just like beach lice. another similarity is that you've gotta be pretty weird if you have a good way to collect them.
And now I can confidently say that mosquitoes are even more disgusting up close.
HE IS BACK!!!
THIS one is made specially for me, and only me. i live in the Caribbean and I'm their first victim, no matter if there is fifty people I'm their preferred food source. Seriously its freaking crazy.
Finally another video by my favorite youtuber!
My day just got better.
My day is already better.
people: "kill all mosquitos"! elephant mostquito: :,(
Nah fuck malaria
hell-O!
15:34 how banana are made, before getting wrapped in the peel.
These videos are the definition of “morbid curiosity”. And I’m here for it.
I'm just waiting for the Homosapien episode
"That's right, they are mosquito bebes out there that we're made from bits of you :)"  -Zefrank 2021
Please oh please can we get a True Facts About Jerry?
Fascinating and humorous as I've come to expect.
I don't know this one by heart, yet.
funny, how such a common insect who is known and hated by everyone came so late in the list
Wow, this was actually quite insightful.
And that ladies and gents, is how the Mosquito do
Delightfully entertaining education
I feel itchy
Glad to see you back!
What’s up with the genetically modified mosquitoes that Bill Gates had released in southern Florida?  What was the reason for that?  How is it working out?
I hate mosquitoes so much that I almost didn't want to watch this video to give them free press.
Ze Frank's videos  just get better and better, and have the  ONLY ads I will listen to.
I was mesmerized by this entire video. I'm still smacking a little bastards when they bite me though. 😂
Pollinates, doesn’t eat from humans, and eats other mosquitos? Awsome!
Seriously this just made my day, "hel-LO"
Information, and sexualization of, a creature I never wanted to know about. But well done nonetheless!
Always puts a smile on my face
The mosquito song is an instant classic.
Between ZeFrank and Casual Geographic, I may never be able to watch straight nature documentaries ever again.
pollinators? wow
"a teddy bear being humped by a chihuahua'. I will never look at my friend's dog the same way again'
I can’t hate these things. They’re just mothers trying to have children. And since they have my blood in them, that makes me the second father.
If I could execute all the mosquitoes. I would.
“Crab-hole creep!”  lol 😂
I now feel like I'm covered in mosquitoes
Makes _no_ sense but I cannot help giggling whenever you say "bebe". 😆
A mosquito can fly  A fly can’t mosquito
I truly think that mosquitoes should be exterminated from the face of this planet. It would benefit everyone and everything, and no one would miss them AT ALLl!
The krill of the air.
The will for Mosquito genocide is humanity's uniting factor
thank you for another video and for the Trypophobia warning
The Messiah returns!
Videos about horseshoe crabs and house centipedes (Scutigera coleoptrata) please! That would be so awesome!
Zefrank should take over the discovery channel and make learning fun again with his videos
I hate them so much, but you are right, they are beautiful.
Brilliant fun!
I've bumped into all types of bugs including these jerks
Eww, mosquitoes. Not even the True Facts narrator can make me not hate them.
Do a video on leeches! Would love to hear what you come up with
The first 30 seconds 🤣
You always delight, and never disappoint.🖤🇨🇦
I wish I had teachers like him in school, not only fun to listen to but learned things also. I did have three that were close in HS, (poetry, intro to psych, and intro to law), can still remember things I learned in them 45+ years later. Will have to check out other videos of his.
,, Im not googling that, dont want it to get mixed up with porn ''   g o d
I just feel a little naughty after watching this. Informed, but still a little naughty, I'm not sure why...
A depressed ghost 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂🤣🤣🤣 and now mine is cured
Yaaay!
LEARN TO THINK--
Do I understand right? Only 5% of Mosquitoes are dangerous to humans but those 5% kill more humans than any other species in the world even more than humans?! ... So Mosquito Wars was right?!
You are seeing the organism that is a vector for some of the most horrible diseases.
So they feed on fish, snakes and manatees? F*ck, imagine getting stung by a mosquito and not being able to scratch where it itches
Was not expecting the mosquito song at the end but much appreciated.
this needs to be part of every public and private school education system
Now I want to see up the butt of every animal. Make it so!
I hate mosquitoes so much.  I interrupted a perfectly fine vibe I had going to watch this. And I was right. I’ve lived in Houston,Tx my whole life and im a ups driver in the country aww man it gets so hot& humid. They’re just heave near this lake Especially after It rains it’s.. like mosquitoes spawn fro the water droplets.. it’s crazy
why did you have to call it plant sperm
"hELLOH!"
do they have a use for nature other than making people crazy
Monke
It cannot be understated how much I appreciate True Facts videos! They never fail to teach me many new things and make me laugh out loud at least a dozen times.
patiently i waited. i was rewarded with 17 minutes of satisfaction.
Best. Ad. Read. EVER!
ZeFrank:  I so enjoy your True Facts videos.  You have a wonderful sense of humor.  Initially, I thought this series was being voiced by Morgan Freeman.  Your voice sounds similar.  Keep up the great work.  Metamorphosis of the mosquito and the variety of these critters is astounding.
Oh God I have the holes thing
What are mosquitos good for? They're pollinators. That's what, Jerry!
Did i hear the phrase , "dicked by a skeeter."
17 minutes long on the worst thing that breathes on planet earth.
If only we could invent a laser beam that rotates around the world to burn only mosquitoes and flys 🪰 I'd be outside more
I’m here in within 30 minutes of you posting!  Did I make it before all of the....... buzzzzz?    I’ll see myself out.
I feel TRICKED! Clickbait, nobody said anything about learning anything.
FINALLY AFTER 2 MONTHS!!!!
Yassssss!!!
Thanks, now I hate mosquitoes even more now.
✝️  Fellowship invite
What happened to Jerry?😢
Aaannnnddddd now I need a shower.
I'm glad you're uploading again, but Holy crap this episode made me feel itchy...
sound like this video was a pain in the ass to make so thank you it was amazing
2:11 *D E M O N ᴮ ᴬ ʸ ᴮ ᴱ ᴴ*
*D E M O N B A B Y*
I once saw a real life mosquito in the wild.
Mosquitos are good for only two things: being food for predatory insects and spiders, and resurrecting dinosaurs
Now to figure out how to destroy them all
I hate Mosquitos, they suck.
Lady gaga entrance 😂
A new Zefrank episode?  "He-LLO!!!"
Me at my partner: BAaaabe he’s back
Fantastic!! Thanks so much for bringing us scientific joy and inappropriate giggles. I love you ZeFrank 😘😘😘😘😘
Dicked by a skeeter.  Sounds like it should be the name of a country song.
Those little suckers are pollinators?...who knew?
Here is to Earbuds & Skeeter Peters.........
3:10 its a water bug. some people call them toe biters. some say its the most painful insect bite
Damn, careful with that thumbnail, I almost smacked my phone screen out of pure instinct
This episode sucked... my blooood. Because that is how the mosquito dooo
Mosquitoes at least have something going for them that makes them cool in a gross parasite that spreads disease sort of way. You wanna know an animal that contributes nothing to society, how about flies? They aren't very interesting, they're gross and prefer the taste of shit and decay, the only reason they are so well known compared to other insects is because they are everywhere and annoying as hell. Even the cockroach has it's moments, the common fly is just a little bastard that annoys the crap out of everyone and doesn't really try to strive for anything interesting like being an expert hunter or eating blood or having a trap jaw.
*Hellooooooo, Zefrank*
do fleas next
Can we get a Meercats video?
Watching this after reading Mosquito Wars makes me appreciate both the former and latter more
Dude. And here last night I thought to myself “Self, I haven’t seen a zefrank vid in quite some time.”   Me today: Yay!
Pupate’ I am dead 💀 😂
dedult
I might reconsider killing a mosqueeetoo next time... but not today ..  coming from Africa ( uganda) it’s kill or be killed .. and am not going down by a mosqueeetoo!
👍😊💯❤✌😎
butt first..
the 2:12 mark made me spit out my drink. Thanks zefrank1 for the demon baby
I like to imagine that these videos take months to make just because he's sitting there trying to come up with stupid stuff to put into his videos.
I'm just imagining what you'd hear if you asked Ze to tell your kids a bedtime story… giggles? Or…screams?
Someone please edit _Duel Of The Fates_ over the fight at 8:33
Your videos always 1. Teach me something and 2. Make me laugh my ass off   Your videos should be used in science classes
Finished the video but I still don't know how a mosquito do.
3:18 "... until you're ready to *poop-potty*"  Jerry: still not convinced he has freudian lips?
HELLOOO!!!!!!!
You outdid yourself yet again, great video zefrank!!
Wait who's Dale? did Jerry get fired?  edit: Oh Jerry's back!.... I wish he was fired.
nobody has finished the video yet
I feel itchy
When one side is outnumbered significantly, I often look for the silver lining. Example: say you have an extra-jerky boss. Plus he smells bad. And he kicks babies and dogs. It's as if there are no redeeming qualities about him. So I look for his good points, or point. I've always hated mosquitoes, and other than worrying about possibly breaking a link in the food chain (by killing all of them), I've often wondered if the world would survive if we did make them go extinct.   Until now.  Thanks to ze frank I now know that 90+% of them are pollinators, and never bite humans. There are some who posit that if all the bees die, we might die, because bees pollinate. Perhaps it's the same same for mosquitoes.
THANK YOU! I Totally, well at least 99.99999999999999999999999999999999... Percent appreciate your videos
bebe
10 seconds in and I cant help but to read and say mosquitoes like MOSCO•TOES ...
Absolutely love this man his videos are educational and funny one of the very few videos that I watch that can still make me laugh sincerely
There is nothing more satisfying that smashing a mosquito that had just ate. It is like a happy surprise!
I don’t know if you made a video of this but you should make a true facts about the axolotl✌️😁
Wake up babe new Zefrank upload
I always hit the like button it's what I do 😂
Watching this video, I had to use every ounce of willpower in my mind to hold back my fist from instinctively smacking the computer screen. I have never felt angrier at anything in my life.
And here I was, feelin all down and dumpy. Then, viola! ze frank emerges from the stale tire-water of YouTube. And now I know that some mossqeetoes are kiddy-fiddlers. Disturbing. 👻 boob
I love that Channel
Anyone else get itchy while watching this?
The first scene made me squint my eyes, when you mentioned trypo I just scrolled down to hide in the comments
Why i am itching!!!!
ugh I have trypophobia... that was fun
I love the editing😂 I always love your videos but this one is brilliant
Ibcanyt wfebthisbecause I can't stop laughing.
Ah, the mosquito. The Wisconsin state bird.
Moscow-Eat-O's is a Russian restaurant whose entire menu is based on Cheeto's.
You are seriously disturbed, but I love it.  Thank you so much for your hard work!!!😂🤣🥰
You joke, but breathing through the ass is a hypothetical procedure/treatment for times when the throat gets damaged or something. Some mammals can actually breathe from their asses for a short period of time. It's very weird.
Mosquitoes: The one thing almost all of humanity can agree need to be wiped off the face of the Earth.
sus
Im really early, i dont know what to do....
Oh god... this is the most violent horrific informative movie ever displayed on youtube.
Love these videos!! ❤❤
You would think a video about Mosquitos would suck but this one was fantastic
Just got home from work. Gonna roll a joint and enjoy some daddy zefrank. This is the life haha
ZEFRANK I LOVE YOU
True facts the human when?
I’m a simple man. I see something with 6 legs or more, I kill.
I've been waiting for new Ze Frank. It's been so long. The true facts videos have really taught me a lot, and I retain the information WAY better than any of my biology classes. This is how they should teach. Wrap the knowledge in humor, like giving your dog medication wrapped in lunch meat.
2:29 The Elephant Mosquito also doesn't suck blood in its adult form.  Truly a noble bug.
My favorite channel ❤  Thanks so much ZeFrank!
The trypophobia, i can't!
2:28 Now I know where SPORE devs got their cell idea...
This feels like his longest episode ever and I couldn't be more happy
So if I got bitten and that mosquito just got given birth, AM I ALSO THE FATHER OF THOSE BABIES ????
I'm watching this while scratching my mosquito bites
I feel very itchy watching this :)
I thought it was gonna be a bad day... until this notification came to me.
Fuck chiclens, what are mosquitoes good for?
The funky song at the end is everything
Oh shit new song this ep
I hate them.
The elephant mosquitoes are the only good ones in the list since they hate mosquitoes in general, like us.
God I hate mosquitoes.
Close up mosquito bites are one of the most horrifying things I have ever watched.
Destroy All Mosquitoes
Ze Frank is the best thing on the internet.  Period.
☠️ 🦟
*sobbing* "you can't make me not hate mosquitos zefrank"  "I won't let you shatter my fairly placed prejudice for blood sucking parasites ;-;"
Still convinced that the human biting mosquito is only good for being bat food and other animals food
I **love** the mosquito song
One of my least favorite bugs, but the inspiration for one of my favorite pokemon, so I guess that balances it out.
How dare you make me like mosquitoes?
Dude, your video's barely been out long enough to watch all the way through and you've already got 2 thousand likes and 300 comments. If that don't show you how much we love you, you're as dumb as a clam. And those things are idiots. I'm sorry but it's true, they can't even read.
Now I can't stop scratching.
Fuck I was utterly disgusted the entire time it was demonstrating the mosquito biting someone  Ughhhhhhhhh
Hehe~ moss-que-ee-toes 0:54
Livestream of a hype group stage match in TI Zefrank notif drops Closes stream to watch it
Burn them all with fire.
Ok so I really never pay close attention to mosquitoes before and it certainly is a weird experience
Elephant mosquito might just be my new favorite animal
I’m relieved you posted this after summer otherwise I’d be traumatized by this!  Keep up the good work.
I think this is the earliest ive ever been
I had no trypophobia, now I have one
The songs yes- Cherry on top-
When are we getting the sounds of animals albums, zefrank? I need a whole EP of hits like the Puffin song or the Mosquito song
there are no words to describe how perfect this video is, another classic zefrank production
Время счастья..! Спасибо.
Wow thanks for making me itchy
“It sort of looks like a depressed ghost. Like one time he said boob on accident and now everyone laughs at him.” WHEN I TELL YOU I SPAT OUT MY WATER 😭😭
I still hate all of them.
So glad to see yet another incredible video. Love how you manage to make these animals so horrifying and hilarious at the same time. Can't wait to see what animal you cover next. 😍
This was epic! We need more! Please lol
"Not often", you say? Oooopsy!!!
19 mins ago.
Amazing and hilarious....as always!
Looking at the lives of some of these animals one realizes how lucky we were that we were born humans.
Hilarious!
That  breath simulation is terrifying if you imagine it in real life, just lying down in a box as mosquitoes are released right at your face
"grow up" i feel so called out lol
Lol 😆
The absolute creepiest things I’ve ever seen… and the funniest… I’ve never felt so dirty, I’m offended and don’t know why, well done Zefrank, well done
"DEMON BABY" I was expecting that 😂😂😂
Thanks dad
Now i feel like im getting bit all over, thanks a lot
You know I hate mosquitoes bites already but now seeing actively what happens under the skin when they bite im Even more dusturbed
I am late damnit
3:08 Isn't that a giant water bug ? the terrifying beetle that flies and bites too ? fuuuuu
5:28 grow up. 🤣 he knew we were laughing
True Facts: The worst insect in the world
Fuck yeah
I HATE these things 👿
H€LL FRIKKIN YEAH!!! I love your videos and they're immediately placed on a playlist!!! BuUuUuUt what I really want is for you to read obvious duh WTAFLUFFERNUTTER🤨 warning labels and explain WHY they feel the need to warn people that curling irons are HOT🙃 and not only will it burn you(DuHdUhDuH) but it really shouldn't be inserted... into any orifice.....🤔 what... who...  when sent them, the Dr bill for their scorched labybits and dudeberriers, ALLLLL  because their*BOB*crapped the bed and who DOESN'T look at a curling iron like"Hmmm I wonder if that'd be a FAB-U-LOUS masturbatory device!?!   Scoot over vibrators..... Revlon is taking over..... and the thought of you reading something like that would be FAB-U-LOUS!!! SoOoOoOoO XOXOXO from Florida aka Mosquito H€LL aka Satan's swampy ass crack! ❣️🤗✌️
Anyone feel really itch watching this?
THANK YOU!!! I was getting worried you had given up.   I missed my favorite comedy channel!
I knew something was coming when I saw the private video in the true facts playlist.
I love most animals on the planet, from spiders to cows to pigeons to butterflies. Parasites (mostly the kinds that destroy the insides of humans or torment livestock, some things that count as parasitic are okay. I mean more the things you usually think of when you hear the term, like tapeworms), including ticks, _and especially_ mosquitos are why it's not _all_
Somethings terrible have just happened to the world. Zefrank has uploaded a video. There my nightmare with the stinkhorn return again.
That "Grow up" was timed so perfectly, I worried for a second that he heard my dumb laugh😂😂😂
*DEMON BABY*
Papa finally uploaded
Frank!!!!!
And this is why I like any animal that eats mosquitos.
Take your ticket within an hour here.
"Now that baby dead baby" 😂😂
True facts about the MMMMMMMMMM
Hell-loow XD
😂😂😂I was the biter in kindergarten 😂😂😂
7:53 when you realize you've been pronouncing "zefrank1" wrong all this time
This historical series is still going strong and I absolutely cannot enjoy it enough.
#o
Hi
It was the lady gaga joke for me
“…dicked by a ‘skeeter”. Now that’s f-ing funny!
'Moss-co-wee-toes'.  I can't.  I just cant.
Now... elephant mosquito is the ideal type ..  Elephant mosquito supremacy
"Demon Baby"
YYYAAAAAAAASSSSS!!!!!!! A new true facts!!!
Sad Ghost: "BOOb!" ...Aww that sucked...
Elephant Mosquitos go from arch-villain to anti-hero. Truly an inspiration to us all 🦟❤
I always  enjoy watching a zefrank1 episode.
@3:07  In the South, we call those Popeye Beetles. Because of their freaky, big àss claws in the front.   Coming across those dàmn things in FL at night on your front porch was Hell fuel 😵‍💫😵‍💫
Notice me daddy! <3
Me: having a cruddy morning Zefrank: uploads Me: WELL THANK FUCK FOR THAT!
Holy Cow! That Flamingo's eyes look like a demon!!!!
you've been doing the same formula for your videos for too long switch it up
You need to do True Facts on Joe Biden....seriously, it would be funny!
Beautiful timing. Only 12 minutes, after literally just randomly checking your channel. So glad that this came back after such a hiatus in the past, and is flourishing.
Who's this Dale guy? Wheres Jerry?
1.1 million people die every year from Mosquitos. But they don't count that anymore,  like death by flu, cold or pneumonia.
Man am I a “sucker” for this channel.  Yeah, I’ll see myself out.
Your videos should honestly be shown in 9-12 biology classes! Kids would pay so much more attention
DEMON BEH-BEH
I got in on the post 2 minutes posted
It's midnight, i should be sleeping by now because tomorrow got something important to do. But zefrank1 uploaded a new video. Might've fucked up my schedule tomorrow. but that's fine, cuz that's what I do.
Zefrank upload. I watch immediately
HE IS BACK!!! With the most dangerous animal
My day is complete
LOL "looks like the insides of a teddy bear humped by a chihuahua" DED
BROOOOO ETS GOOOO
Can we all agree that mosquitos can go straight to hell.
"straining soup through a moustache" how the hell does he come up with these kinds of analogies? XD
i love this channel😭
Better than science class lol
😲!
Quick ...grab the blowtorch 🔥🔥🔥😅
The quality of image was bad Then i saw it was a new video and a great happyness filled my nostrils
D E M O N  B E H B E H
Oh wow, up for 10 minutes, and Zefrank posted... today is a lil ok
God is back 😭
7:54 We have been enlightened. It's not pronounced "zee frank" it's pronounced "zay frank"
Microcosmos is a great movie
Ok
The fact they're pollinators shows just how insane and likely disastrous those so-called scientists were to release genetically modified mosquitoes.
This is awesome
Nice!
As soon as I saw the title I was imaging how he would pronounce mosquitos.
God bless the dragonfly larvae
The one you didn't know is a water scorpion often referred to as a toe biter. Freshwater insects.

The cat approves

"Gettin dicked by a skeeter" I felt that
Oh I've missed you ZeFrank!!!
That banshee kills more people than cancer. The major human predator is a flying grain of rice.
Mosquito-borne diseases are those spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. Diseases that are spread to people by mosquitoes include Zika virus, West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, dengue, and malaria.

"Like, one time he said "boob" by mistake and now everyone laughs at him."

Famous last words “WHAT THE FU-“ Zefrank, and almost every person in war right before death
Word
Never thought I'd be so excited for mosquitoes lmfao
"A dildo wearing glasses" - This kind of commentary is why we watch Zefrank instead of Attenborough
if a mosquito bit and used your blood to nourish it's eggs, that technically makes you a father to mosquitoes
👹Demon Baby👹
Poor Johnston....
About time you did the mosquito one, thanks!!

Yes. I really wanted to learn about how those muppets fucked each other so that their granddaughter can give me dengue again once I'm cured of this one currently  Cheers, Frankie
