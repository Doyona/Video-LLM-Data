Way to give them east coast people a piece of Boston humble cream  pie.
Warriors 🔥🔥🔥🏆🏆🏆
This has nothing to do with basketball, but SF mayor is kind of cute imo
Wonderful coach character, and spirit awesome...Glad they've had fun together...continued safety and lots, and lots of blessings...All Love....
From Steve Kerr, “I’m hungover,” was the best line.
You can tell steph curry really likes poole I remember people were saying he can take currys spot that curry better watch out his job is on the line curry didn't hate or get mad he embraced poole helped him get better and became friends with him now that's greatness
After their game 3 loss many talking heads gave the trophy to Boston Warriors were too small Boston bigs are killing the warriors  They can’t rebound  They have to break up team  Warriors can’t take 3 games from Boston  Game 4 they came back and took it  The rest is history  Where are the talking heads now Just put your hands up Stop talking no warriors fans are paying attention to you ok Go cry with Boston no Baston.head
Steve Kerr -  Class and character. Blessings on you Steve!!!

Guys give this lady another try I know she’s a mess she messed up but she’s trying sometimes shit happens
I love ❤️ DELTA ✈️ ♥️
I just love everything about the Golden State Warriors.
”look at champ right here.” 😂
A big round of applause to my idol Stephen Curry,  his teamates  and coaches for another milestone.Congratulations and enjoy the moment!  Arriba  GSW!!
Congratulations Warriors, I'm so so so happy for you wished my hubby was living to see this.
勇士总冠军！！！！！🏆
Can't wait to make it 1 day 🌟
Shout out steph 💪
So how many’s championships trophy’s do the warrior have now I thinks maybe 7 and how many’s championships the Celtic have now 18 maybes . I thinks the warriors won more than the Celtics now ha ha ha .
Was that a chartered flight?
Shout out to cheryl. "Hey steve, did you miss me?" Classic...
Jah Morant and the grizzlies keep fueling our fire!!! Go dubs
After they lost Game 1 I was not feeling so hit they could win it all.  Then down 2 games to 1 I was skeptical.  After they started covering the threes, playing better defense and having guys in the key to rebound it wasn’t even close.  Brown pretty good.  Tatum pretty good.  Smart okay sometimes and the rest of them Bums.  Plus their fans are ugly outside and inside.  FU BOSTON!  Great team win in game 6.
GSW CHAMPS 🏆Congratulations
this heart warming video should be shown to the Celtics again and again this summer so that they learn what it takes to get there
cancel all woke sports
Not even a parade tho...?
I predicted the NBA Championship back in December after the Warriors got off to a great start. Then they faltered a bit and had some losing streaks while Draymond was out. I still thought they'd win. Mayor Breed, this isn't the first time the Warriors won a championship in San Francisco; in 1975 when they won the NBA title , the first two games of the finals were played at the Cow Palace, and there was a rally in Union Square in SF a few days later, and a rally at the Oakland Arena after that. No parade then, though six years later the 49ers had one.
Pretty cool shot of the plane landing back in San Fran with the trophy on board! :) 🏆
Make sure at the parade you wear a mask and a bullet proof vest!! Thats your state in short!!!
8th street is where the Civic Center is located. Good change of plan.
Ignorant Fans think NBA is Legit . Shit is RIGGED 100% . The Players are all Freemason Sellout Circus Monkeys . haha  100% GARBAGE .
the big deal is no one expected you guys to make it. OKAY LOL
Chocolate wasted!!
I think the Mayor only watched the first quarter
How many people know that the Warriors started in Philadelphia?
I use to hate Steve Kerr back when he was a Bulls player. I mean MJ was a given but Steve adding to the Jazz woes with his 3 pointers? But those days were long over. Nothing but admiration for him now. Here's wishing to see GS win more NBA titles with him at the helm.
Became a Warriors fan many years ago, when I fallen for Chris Mullin, and it's been one of the best choices of my life. Congrats Warriors!
Dynasties fly Delta!
What we’re the ratings on the finals congrats warriors 🤷🏻‍♂️
Kerr’s the G of Mt. Rushmore…”I’m not gonna lie I’m hungover” but I’ll give this interview bc I’m still drunk and happy AF👍👅💯
this makes me want to live there.
Who cares! I hate the woke NBA! Kiss my azz NBA! You suck!
Does anyone know what kind cigar MVP #30 was smoking? I would like to order some of those.
Kyrie Irving hit the greatest single shot in NBA history.  And it was in Steph's face!
If there were no NBA, America would have the world's tallest garbage men.
Who cares?
Nobody gives a shit about the CCP League!!!!!
Draymond always quick to hold the trophy smh
He still holding the winning ball that andrei handed him. I appreciate Andrei for that   so much respect
No one deserves it more than you guys. Congratulations! Thanks for bringing the championship back to the Bay!
🏆Curry! 😎🤙🏾
In reality you are absolutely different from that image of yourselves that you have created in your external consciousness. And your might is unlimited. The potential to be God is laid within you, within each of you. As a matter of fact, you are gods. And your task is to master your divinity little by little, to let the divinity enter your external consciousness.
Congratulation GSW best in the world
This one means a lot. Thank you Warriors!
Steve Kerr is the ultimate winner, and such a class act.
Very nice Lakers
Repent to Jesus Christ  “Praise the Lord, my soul, and forget not all his benefits—” ‭‭Psalms‬ ‭103:2‬ ‭NIV‬‬ h
Homies flew delta. I ain’t mad.
Been a fan since Baron Davis days. Shit, Jason Richardson days lol
Steve Kerr: "Not gonna lie I'm a little high" -Dave Chappelle's friend, Chip
Please give GP2 a contract. Love ❤️ the core guys, Curry, Klay, Dray and need blue collar guys. Keep GP2.
please have the  same team    for years , Lebron does not belong in the team
Will they be at City Hall though 🤔?
People hate on repeated winners. Yall counted them out and lost...again!
Congrats from Spain best NBA team right now
🏆 🏆 🏆 🏆
Yes, the Warrior's are Champions!  Well- deserved, but your city, Ms. Breed, remains a cesspool.  You cannot ride on the coattails of the Warriors.  They did their job.  Now do yours!
WARRIORS 🌉🏀👌DUBZ  THANK YOU & BLESS YOU  LETS GO!!🏆🏆🏆🏆🙏
Bihh said "National Champions" 😂😂😂😂💀💀💀💀 this not college football mayor lady lol
Love and hate warriors the same time.  Love Lakers during kobe.  No love for the current Lakers wanner be goat Labron 😁
They better have gun control at the parade and a lot of cops swat team checkpoints I be watching at home Go Warriors you did California proud
Thanks for this, felt like a chase center employee welcoming them home!
Agree with Steve Kerr, i thought Suns, Bucks or Heat will win the championship
They fly commercial?? Wow I had no idea.
Indonesia hadir
Congratulations. NOW i can go  to sleep happy.
9 ring 4 steve
If this mayor will be half as dedicated to her job as the warriors players and staff are, SF will be in a better place.
I m hang over also
There is a bus driver(an all-star player. carrying the team) and a bus rider( player who has little to no impact on the team success).- Charles Barkley  Green is one of the luckiest and most cocky bus Riders. He could easily be replaced.
a nail bitter?
Steve Kerr: I'm hung over. 😆. Gotta be the most epic response when asked " how you're doing".
30 for 30 with #30
Perkins/Chuck/Max/ Celtic fans 😭😭😭😭
I DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO BRING THE LORD INTO THE CELEBRATION! I'LL SAY THANK YOU JESUS! (FOR them!) HALLELUJAH! 🙏🙌💞
Not True! Warriors fans (the real ones) Totally expected this win. It was a bumpy ride but that “sample” at beginning of season gave me hope! Cuz this entire team are WARRIORS! 💥🏆💙💛
Wnba who won again ? 😂😂😂 this is how much people care about the NBA you
Nobody cares about London breed dumbest minority hire ever.
GSW BABY
This time the parade is in San Francisco instead of Oakland.
Titles back on the best coast
Jeez I guess we just won the ncaa tournament because we’re national champions? I didnt know mayor, I thought we were “world champions.” Lol
God bless you golden state 👏👏👏👏💪👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
God bless you steph curry 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪😍💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
What a victorious day! #DubNation 💛💙
Yeah baby bay area faithful salute your champions
Mayor is 🗑️
Next year it will be pistons vs golden lol in my dreams. The pistons are god awful they'd a miracle to make it.
WORLD CHAMPIONS not national champions. She really knows her basketball 😏 Typical politician.
🍀🍀🍀Congratulations Warriors!!! 👏 👏👏 Love you all. ❤❤❤ Steph Curry ~ Wow3!!! Finals MVP!!! Well-deserved award! Congrats Steph! 🤗
When parade??
Lol 😂 steph curry probably did sleep with that cigar
The best crowd  The best Organization and franchise Great front office  Great coach and assistant coach  The greatest players of this generation , simply the best                    To Boston you are good and hope the young players can take something from this run
Steph is an entertainer. His rainbow three is a beautiful thing like Federers backhand and Usains curve..
The chemistry between this team make them unique
Hey Mayor we’re live  Mayor: oh y’all live? Well let me stop and greet the Bay!
Lol @ National Champions.
Steve Kerr got 9 rings he goated no 🧢
I am soo proud of this team. 👏
I am sooo proud of this team.
wow they flew on just a regular delta jet? no private deluxe charter?
🏆 The Bay Is Back 🏀
Congrats Warriors Steve Kerr the man with the plan.
And James Harden still doesn't have a ring
Congratulations to the warriors
She said NATIONAL 😭😭🤣🤣
I hope they comeback next year and set the NBA on 🔥. Curry playing more relaxed , GP2 being a defensive menace , Poole coming into his game , Klay being more healthier, Kuminga getting better , Wiseman being productive. Run it back!!!
Warriorssssssssssssssss ‼️🌉🏆
Who was that Karen they hired to handle the media 😳😂
Did the white lady think she was gonna get interviewed ?
Grounded and focused on being the best they can be.
They built an empire
I know it would be fun to clinch in front of their home fans but I'm glad GS took it to the Celtics in their own house. A 21-0 run on the road in hostile territory? Unheard of! But this team did it. Strength in Numbers is back!
damn that trophy looks good in the sunlight
Congratulations to dem boizz💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Steve Kerr the best coach. He party with his players
Presenting! Your 2022 nba champions! The golden state warriors!
he's d best coach ever...very calm and so chill...wid steph so humble nd down-to-earth...we luv u both nd d team...mwah!
Thats actually kinda cool they got to chill with eachother for that long 5+ hour flight. Other 3 were clinched at home. Probably had a lot of fun on that flight.
The amount of press these guys do is pretty insane. Pregame. Midgame. Postgame. Between games. After losses. After wins. After landing at the airport. Especially Kerr. But they handle it well.
Indeed she does know Steve Kerr! 🔥 Dub Nation!
That boy Steve outchea 🤣💀
Class of his own.
You know the Mayor didn’t watch the game talking about “It was a nail bitter” 🤣🤣
Felicitaciones a los guerreros de la bahía💪 aqui su fan #1
Let’s go Dubs!!!  I haven’t missed a parade yet, I’ll be there, coming from Oakland!!!
Imagine moving Arenas , & getting the Chip within the next yr 😂💥! Lets go Dubs 🌉
BAY AREA WE UP NOW!!!!!
Props to the mayor for saying “national” champions
I love how steph it’s always elevating his teammates,  that’s why hi is so love among them
Steve Kerr for President
Doesn't the mayor of San Francisco  have more important things to do , no disrespect  the city look like shit.
Where's Durant? Lol
As a lifelong lakers fan. I have a lot of respect for the warriors. Klay is Mychals son and I remember when mychal thompson was on the showtime lakers. I’m always happy when the Boston Celtics lose. Steve Kerr went to palisades high school in the LA area. Also Kerr followed the footsteps of Phil Jackson and Gregg Popovich. Class act. I’m also a lifelong Dodgers fan who hates the San Francisco Giants.
Warriors flying Delta? 😂 Come on yall got a billionaire owner 😂
Go warriors
You play the game to win it all. Regardless of what team you cheers for you have to respect winners. Congratulations to Warriors 🎉
when they went on that win streak early in the season should’ve stopped all doubts
No one is better tgen stephen curry nor golden state warriors
They are good and no body likes them....sign of champs
Bro this parade looks like it’s gonna suck! Only from market to 8th!? They seriously underestimated the amount of people coming. Lol it was a better layout in Oakland
Wow maybe the mayor should clear up the homelessness and drug usage in the city other than worrying about a basketball game
My guy Kerr still faded!!  🤣
East OAKLAND Warriors! Parade should of be in Oakland not boosie ass Frisco
5 championship later , I hope warriors can buy a private ✈️ airplane
Was that the chicken seasoning lady? 🤣
I love how the Warriors made everyone believe that Phoenix Suns is the team to beat😂😂😂
I am so proud of warriors congratulations  and many more God is good
Im laker and clippers fan…but you have to hand it to steph and his team! They fought hard for this championship and i am glad they run away with their reward!
The mayor of San Francisco tho 😳..😍
Lebron should have stayed at Cleveland. He will never win another title again
I don’t care what the mayor thinks….
JEEZ NOT FOR Sam Francisco ITS FOR OAKLAND!!
Dell must be walking in the clouds and justifiably so.
That male interview has got to be trolling. You really asked him how was the plane and did they do anything fun on the plane??? Even Steve didn’t have answers because the questions was so off beat.
3 From Oakland and now 1 on SFO! Congratulations DUB NATION 2022 Champs Baybay!!!
Way to go champs. Everyone doubted us, we even had a player leave us and go to Lakers and I'm sure you regret that bazemore. But way to go. This one is very special and I hope more is on the way
The weakest championship since the bubble.   The two seasons Kawhi was injured, you had two weak teams win the championship (The Bucks and the Warriors)   Enjoy your weak championship. Kawhi will be back fully healthy next season. 🤷🏾‍♀️
I absolutely cannot stand San Francisco as a city.  I have 5 U.S. cities I dislike the most, and SF tops it.  It's become horribly overpriced, overrated, overly dirty, and culturally-pretentious as hell, and I hate that they took GSW out of Oakland.  (Ironically, I don't like Boston, either, but San Francisco tops my list of U.S. "Eww" cities.)  And yet, I could not be more glad that GSW brought the championship home to the Bay Area.  They're _that_ hard to sports-hate.  Just a great team and organization, from the top down.  You just don't see a team like this in sports anywhere, where the whole organization is just stellar.  Treasure them well, San Francisco.  They're your city's best asset.
Looks like Steve pulled something dancing 😂😂
People must stop saying that NO ONE expected this. I expected! And millions of people too! We rooted for this team for the entire season because we believed in it! And here we are!  Of course we can't know it! No one knows for sure. But if you're putting on the hard work, if you're rooting day in and day out, it's because you BELIEVE AND EXPECT IT CAN HAPPEN. And it did! And we're so happy about it! 🏀🏆🏆🏆🏆
Forever warriors !!
Whooping Boston 2xs in their own gym!! Priceless
Draymond Sucks !
Warriors warriors 💛
Greens mouth don't match his game.  Keep curry, klay, poole and wiggins together, they can always build around them.
Most beloved team in Bay Area history. No SF-East Bay split like in NFL or MLB. Everyone loves the Dubs.
Congratulations and God bless #goldenstatewarriors, #dubnation, #strengthinnumbers, #goldblooded. ⛹️‍♂️👟🏀🇵🇭💪🏋️‍♂️🌊💣💯🤑🏅👌🐐💦🙏🎊🏆😁👏👍🦸‍♂️🤘
God doesn’t want anybody in hell because He loves us, but you must understand why we deserve hell and why those who refuse to live under His authority will go there. He gave us the law (Ten Commandments) not to make us righteous, but rather to show us our sin (Romans 3:20). We’re not sinners because we sin, but rather we sin because we’re sinners. Sin is the nature of our flesh that we are born with due to the sin of Adam in the garden. For someone to be justified before God they have to be sinless. We’ve all sinned (Romans 3:23), and the the law demands death for those who sin (Romans 6:23). God is righteous, so He must punish our sin, which is what He did through His Son Jesus Christ on the cross. Jesus is Holy and sinless, yet He received our sin when He died on the cross, so that we can be righteous before God (2 Corinthians 5:21). When He died on the cross, He said “It is finished” (John 19:30), which means He paid the full price for all of your sins (past, present, and future) to be forgiven. He was buried and rose again from the dead. God will forgive anybody who puts their full trust in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. We aren’t saved based on our good deeds, but only by the grace of God (Ephesians 2:8-9). His precious blood that He shed is the only reason why we can be forgiven of our sins (Hebrews 9:22). If you confess that Jesus is Lord and believe that God raised Him from the dead, then you’ll be saved (Romans 10:9). You are born-again with the Spirit of Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17), and are not only legally justified before God, but also are accredited His righteous (Romans 4:24). Believers live for Christ now, so get to know Him through His Word. I recommend reading the book of Romans and the gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), and watching Pastor Joseph Prince’s online sermons!
'How many rings do you have Steve' 'I lost count'
Steve Kerr is still fuck'd up-AS HE SHOULD BE!! CONGRATULATIONS!
🔥🔥🔥
That mayor is mad kool mayors need to learn a lot from her
With all thier money how come they dont have a private jet smh
Why TF is D.Green carrying the trophy like he Curry or Klay even. GS would of won this without him. Dude is along for the ride and that it. Coattails Foo. Knows his career would be non existent on any other team.
Lol I’m not  going to lie right now I’m hungover
Omg I didn’t know I was live really isn’t that what you suppose to do
Stephen Curry is not the most important player of the Warriors. Stephen Curry IS the Golden State Warriors.
Golden State is a golden organization...... Every other team in the league needs to look at GS, and rather than hating on them, they need to take notes!! For real!!!
the golden trash wom this one eh
Yes! Golden state Warriors did their thing! Watched the game and they kept going and didn’t stop!! Yes I agree with the mayor 100% !!
She’s is fine
nice review :) gg well played . .  @->-- #POWERGPU #Typicalgamer
Never fear madam Mayor, I'll be on Market St. Monday at 11:30 am!
Steve Kerr, have nine rings (5 as player & 4 as coach)! Steve will eventually catch up to Coach Phil Jackson and Red Auerbach!
WELLLLLL DESERVED🏆🏆🏆🏆🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
The 2nd team to beat Boston in their homecourt. 1st time to do it is Lakers, and that is last 1985. GSW more Championships, still a lot of haters here in the Philippines. We support you Steph, the Warriors, the whole organization. 💪😁
Will BigdawsTV join the parade???
Steve is a good man
I so love ❤️ GSW and all the GSW supporters and fam.
Steve Kerr has a total of 9 rings.
Steve: Im not gonna lie im pretty hungover from last night  He got clean lastnight
DOPEEEEEEE🔥🔥🔥
I wish my city one day will have this again🥲
Go Delta! Congrats to the Dubs. Warrrrriors!
The on site reporter was annoying
Ms. Cheryl you are an amazing reporter! I love you so much! Keep doing your thing!!  Love from Houston, TX...🥰🤗
I mean I know that warriors weren’t originally the favorites to come out of the west, but I don’t think that nobody expected them to not make it to the finals at least. I mean all they really had to get through was phoenix who were originally the favorites but they fell apart so there was really nobody else in the west tbh
Look fck calling him Steph from now on for me he'll be called Big 30 because he's a bad Man!!A die hard bulls fan.
Steve Kerr got to play and win for two of the greatest coaches ever. He was paying attention
We cant be hating on the Dubs they work hard all year this is to show that when you work hard you  get a reward from it
I really appreciate Steve Kerr he really is a humble, kind individual.
world champs not just national
Warriors fanrandy
I thought the team had a private plane.
It’s refreshing to finally hear someone calling them ‘National Champions’, as opposed to world champions.
They pretty much dominated the entire season..every time they got humbled they had an answer..their depth is insane
Why are flying delta ? Boston is a hub for delta but being there in SF they should be flying united
Not a fan of the warriors but the best team won and congrats!🏆🏀
Idk why so many keep saying we never expected them to win this year. I've literally 100% been confident that the day klay came back they would make the finals.  I was also 100% confident that there was no way the raptors would beat them. And 100% confident they would beat the cavs being up 3-1. But 1 thing is I just always have confidence in THE GREATEST MODERN ERA TEAM EVER. congratulations to them now it's time to make poole and them young guys 2x Champs 🏆
Delta? Warriors don't have their own plane?
Hope Lebron see this.... Lol
Splash Daddy Kerr
Steve kerr got 9 rings  #GOAT
🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
I did! I predicted the Warriors would win the NBA Championship at the beginning of the season!
awww   love these guys! 🥰
The mayor  she is sexy
Classy stand-up guy
game ain't a nail baiter.. Mayor is clearly lying
1 Corinthians 4:10 We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.
Warriors dynasty is still very much alive 🌉🏀🏆🔥
So good to wake up to this. Cant wait to see the parade!
Thank you warriors and congratulations 👏👏👏
Omg, I've been a fan since 1963 when the Warriors use to play their home games at the Cow Palace and the SF Civic Auditorium. And I can remember the excitement that Rick Barry and the team brought the City in 1975, but this decade of Warriors basketball is just incredibly special. Let's all appreciate this special version of the Warriors! Hey Dub Nation, PARADE COMING UP ON MONDAY!!!!!! 🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Steve Kerr is Phil Jackson and Gregg Popovich in one as a coach.
Well deserved curry well deserved
I expected them to make it!!!!!
Steve Kerr for president!!!! Love 💕 all the warriors!!!! So happy they won!!!!!
Curry 4 rings, 1 final mvp so dose that mean the other 3 he was not the most valuable player
Mayor Human Feces.🤣🤣🤣
Please stop sucking this man offf
KERR A HOE🔥✅🥷🏻
3:41 👍😀🍻
These characters are just epic. Nothing short of extraordinary you guys are
And at the end of the day you still lose because CA is ran by a bunch of democrats with bad policy. Congrats
And just like that, no more mask. The virus is still here. WFT????
You must really appreciate Kerr’s leadership. Everyone reflects that same humility.  Quiet greatness!
I'll say it again klay is a top 75 player ever. Who will disagree.
💜💜💜
Lol “omg didn’t know I was live” 😂 had re play that
2:35 your question would be how many rings does he have?? Really woman?
Steve Kerr is such a cool person. He deserves all the success.
She didn't know what she was talking about, lmfao. National champions, California SUCKS
What's up Dub nations once again the championship coming home to where it belongs....🔥🔥🔥
Watching a closed league with no relegation is like watching WWE
Oh gee.....I missed that ....dang
London breed is falling down falling down hahahaha
Steve Kerr with 9 championships holy smoke 😳
Beating a city like Boston is the greatest victory of all time. I will never forget this one way to rep the Bay Area Warriors you made us all proud to be apart of DubNation.
Look how his teammates respect him,they know he's the alpha
So proud of the WARRIERS. GO DUB NATION.
Congrats Steph and Dubs from Sengkang
Thanks Mayor.
Congrats Coach Kerr n the golden state  warriors.  CHAMPIONS. AGAIN.
Whoop that trick.
1 of the most boring playoff yr in NBA history
Steve Kerr is talking so slow. He is clearly hanged over lol

Woman how many rings? That is what you will ask him?!?
This is probably Steph's most meaningful championship
Baaaaahhh London Reed, make sure people’s car windows ain’t smashed lol I can see the headline now “NBA finals champ’s car broken into in SF during championship parade”
Bruh is it me or is Steph displaying some Swagger out here! Bruh I feel his confidence is 10/10 and is sure acting like the baddest mf on the basketball planet right now! If he has this type of confidence and swagger and “meanness”, I really believe he will lead his team to a repeat!
The Larry OB with the square base is 10x better congrats to the dubs tho
Steph So humble  Such a great role model
The haters on GSW have got issues with theyself ..Nice guys Drafted guys Steph was a College reject and now he's top 10 all time Dreams come tru
Why interview London Breed ? 😡😡😡
Breed had no business being in this segment.  Get that political trash out of here
❤️❤️🏆💙💛
The Mayor is such a vibe ❤
Congratulations Warriors 🏆🙌👏👏👏
Warriors warriors warriors warriors warriors warriors warriors warriors warriors warriors warriors warriors warriors warriors warriors congratulations to GSW champion congrats Steph curry MVP MVP MVP
steph curry is really so inspirational, even his fit, walking with basketball and his overall disposition and appreciation.. making people better inside and outside the court
All drug addicts and homeless in San Francisco will celebrate on Monday yeheyyyy
🙏🏼🙏🏼
They better blast Big Steppin' in the parade
World Champs the Goat 🐐
I don’t know why people hating on GSW. Every single players are a freaking HUMBLE STAR. Everyone shine together, not like the typical 1-2 individual star player.
We had a celebration too last night here in PH with friends,thank you Warriors!
Let go warrior another one next year let goooo
2022 NBA CHAMPS GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS 🏆🏆🏆🏆
An NBA championship won't stop people from observing the homeless problem. Good try though.
Thank you guys for the hard work! Front office and roster. So easy to root for you guys!! Lets run it back!!!
Damn the mayor cakin!!!! 🍰
Congratulations dynasty Warriors 💛💙💛💙🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀🏀
That bissssshhh said it was "hard to watch and a nail biter" smh that bisssshhhhh obviously didn't watch the game or the series no mames pendeja!
I kinda feel like this chip they won out of reflex. They knew what to do, right moves and adjustments, nothing new but they deep down didn't expect to win - with Ja, Middleton going down, the series really hung on to the health of a couple of key pieces for some teams..
I dont get why they didn’t expect it. We’ve seen Steph Curry carry this team alone last season (with dray but Dray was playing really bad last seaone specially when Steph is not around). But with what Curry showed last season no wonder why they would win this season if just another 2 player would step up luckily Wiggin, Poole did step up even though we were all expecting from Wiseman and not them. And then there is Gary Payton 2, Kaminga and other players that are promising too. and then announcement of Klay’s return which gave us the idea of them being great again. Thinking about it now Wiggins really did step up and Bob Myers did a hellajob picking all this players!
Wow Curry is the most humble nba star of all time
CONGRATULATIONS FROM PORTLAND OREGON !!!!
Steve is hilarious no lie.... Im going to the parade in SF.... Lets go Warriors
0:15 did they let draymond drive the plane after drinking a 5th of hennny?
He is the number 1 goat
welcome to warriors invitational.
This one means a lot. Thank you Warriors!
All that money but no private jet lmaoooo
🏆🏀👍👏👏👏💙💛🌸🇯🇵🇵🇭
Let's go dubs 🌉 🔥
🐐
Two basketball players walk into a bar, one wearing green and the other gold, a reporter in the bar asks them: "Do you have commemorative balls?" The one in gold says: "We both do but mine has a ring around them".
Bay area make some noise 🔥🔥
Steve needs a thumb ring for this one
“Did you miss me?”👀
this video was spoiled by london breed
Nail biter? She didn’t watch the game!
Steve Kerr: I'm not gonna lie I'm hungover right now I'm Hella weak hahaha
VERROD VICIOUS
https://youtube.com/channel/UC6uXy1hoJW6l6XfctH3_6bg
that mayors full of crap it wasn't a nail biter
3-peat.
I see some ABC mikes but everyone ignores them and moves over to the NBC one. Why's that?
🙄
Since they have 2 homes, I hope there will also be a parade in Oakland...
Kd better come back to give steph his 5th ring and kerr 10th
Steve looks exhausted
Wow, United Airlines got screwed. How do you sponsor the Ws and not get the money shot with the chip?
Do the warriors book out the whole plane?
I love what Steve Kerr said that he found it funny that Draymond mocking the Boston fans  🤣
America’s team of the NBA 🐻⤵️
Next stop: Gold medal for Team USA 2024 Olympics
😀
People still watch nba???
*they better be careful to stay out of Oakland. Someone will probably rob them and steal the trophy 🏆 lmao*
Tell ‘em Draymond
It's 9 ring's Cheryl not including his wedding ring otherwise that would be 10 rings.
Offense wins games. Defense wins championships.
