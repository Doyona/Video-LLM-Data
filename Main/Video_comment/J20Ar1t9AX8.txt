This proves roadmen can't fight for shit you can see why they use guns and machetes lmao. Dude was talking about killing deji but cant throw a punch
Anyone here what that random guy in the background said at 5:13? I swear some guy said “white n****r”
“Punch you up then I’ll punch up deji”
Love the pearly-whites, Swarmz
Body shots and uppercut the grab attempts, start thinking ahead, you know his gonna crab you after a couple times of grabbing you, that's one of his strengths so use it against him, counter his grabs with close range, using Huck's opens you up for grabs so when you spam Huck's to the body you know his gonna rush close the distance to grab, bait him into a upper cut with it, that would fuck him up, then spam the Huck's, you need training on baiting, once you've got that then you can up your game, it's all about faints and baits, any fighter that's skilled will tell you, fighting is a dance, it's out thinking your opponent like a game of chess
swarmz is the goat
You can't say you think you won. Deji put in so much more work and effort into this fight than you did in the moment💯
Respect to anyone that gets in tge ring
He almost sounds like scarlxrd isn’t it?
Deji took swarmz to school he just walk him down
I believe in you swarm
Put a shirt on
2:24 swarmz only 2 hitting to head is cool but if it aint deji and instead a puncher hitting you to the body the way deji was - you are gonna wish it was to the head instead
Tbf no one can ever say that 'Swarmz ducks'. This man took on BOTH Deji n JJ and took on Ryan Taylor. Now it could be Pineda.  Hes got balls. Fair play.
“Experience” only experience helped deji was him not freezing up, even in this video your so confident, but still got dropped and didn’t even drop deji once nor hurt him, he had way more punches on you, way faster then you, had way more agility, you have to many excuses including your experience.
Just gotta say deji was not scared my g like we like you man but youre acting like flightreacts with these dilutions
Respect this man.
U definitely did not win the first round but still a massive improvement
You got cooked the whole fight brudda
Mad respect, can definately see you put in the work
❤❤❤❤
You didn't follow up because you knew deji would hurt you if you tried 😅
Sorry he won all 4 but you have come a long way, keep going. Inspiring shit
Fight pineda and show us i know you will win but i wanna see the madman against someone relevant to the scene
Lyca I still listen to it🎉
If you would have thrown punches you would have won
Bro just shut up you lost 💀
Big up swarmz
I wanna see Swarmz vs Kenny!!! I think its a good stylistic matchup
the amount of work this guy puts in and still gives his opponents sm credit makes me rate him loads
I'm sorry but Swarmz is great but be honest with yourself lmao
I see potential in him. Train more and he’ll get good at it.
you being boxing influencer that only training for 8 month and you're doing great though, we see some improvement each of your fight
Swarmz fought 2/3 of his first fights with some of the best in the scene. (ik dejis 2-3 but he's at his best rn). Props to him. Can't wait for the match with pineda
Swarmzy
it was a cut short swarmz say "i wanna....." with Ade, its SO DISRECTFUL
Deji def weren’t scared💀
Deji dont got 5 years tho he had a 3 year gap lol but still impressive as shit from swarmz
You’re improving madly brodie Continue your famzino
Work in silence
So talking the most
If you opened up your guard and fight y would have got knocked out because Deji has good head movement
Respect for putting up a fight against deji. Imo he's probably the most gifted influencer boxer so it was always gna be tuff for you
Also follow up with yo jab
Did better than Fousey and his ass been training longer than u 😂
It was a great fight
Me fighting you would be a easy fight I would even pay you to fight me bro real talk keep running that mouth you don't want this smoke druski
Please make weekly vids
The way to beat Deji is pressure
Swarmz didn’t run away from Pineda, he just disconnected from the server because of a power cut.
Walking into the corner wasn’t only a good move but is a legitimately high level defensive strategy, if mans didn’t have all that angle knowledge out there that defense paired with the check hooks would have minced mans up bad bad fs while you stay pretty xD; mad respect to deji’s head movement and ability to read a telegraphed punch pattern. If swarms need anything it’s to get more comfortable coming into range
man stop you give the first round to yourself lol mate boxing does not score only on punches but defence and ring control and damage many more
Swarmz deserves a easier fight bro, he has had 3 fights and 2 of  them were fighting since the start of influencer boxing
Nothing but love and respect
Although I was rooting for Deji I’m entertained by your performance and I’d like to see you fight in the future
man i was actually secretly rooting for you bruh but if you wouldve just been a little more offensive you might had a chance
Big up yaself
Oiii your a funny guy ya know quality video bro ❤
Bro threw all his tops away
You didn’t rock Deji with that punch he was expecting you to continue your attack and started to move in advance.
Yeah, looking back, even when Dej outboxed you for most, if not all rounds, you definitely had enough moments for this to be fight of the night besides Viruzz v DK Money. God be with yu, my guy!😁
Reppin the chi town cubs can’t complain great fight hope your back
you got piced up all the rounds💀you wern't close to getting the 1st round deji threw more and landed more you hit him 2 times that round stop lying to yourself😂 still massiv respect for fighting him
swarmz punch outburst towards the end of the 3rd round was nice but only about 2 punches landed from it
swarmz is one of the only people in the scene that isn't scared. he hasn't backed down from a single challenge
lowkey i wanna see swarmz destroy chase demoor🤣
bro if you do a rematch, i think you will win
Hopefully you’re a bit more humble now and don’t have a bigger ego than ksi (which is saying something)
Looking back at this fight, it's closer than you think for 2 rounds, I just think Deji outworked you Swarmz. You saw what you done wrong though, so it's actually a good lesson for you to see that footage back.
swarmz is actually funny as hell
I respect what you do and how hard you work bruda. Inspirational.
I actually like this guy and his personality gonna watch him more
Refine ur tech, increase cardio and you will be a problem. Well done tho, you did really well through this journey
Mad Man funny af 😂
Damn kinda love and respect this guy now, surely gonna rooting for him to win next match. Keep working bro u got this
Fair play bro u did good, even John Fury was entertained from watching u fight
No hate against swarmz but to say his been doing this for 5 years is quite misleading after the Jake fight he was inactive for over a year and it’s not like he was training consistently in between
As a KSI and Deji fan you’re doing great in the misfits scene, I’m always excited to see your fights, you’ve done great so far can’t wait to see you back in the ring
Swarmz is the most improved in the shortest amount of time
Swarmz when u went ooh them shots were sick icl u have improved always gonna believe in u my bro
even tho he spoke so much shit and got smoked, i have gained some respect for swarmz becausse of how he took the loss. i didnt like how he spoke to leon but it is what it is. also wtf is he on about only 2 of dejis shots landed lmfao
Man thought he was an editor,Swarms not to be rude,but Deji would fight 5 of you and still win mate
Man said "He was scared,he was scared"
Wejiiii
I like how you've continued to carry yourself gracefully despite being persistently disrespected to your face. It was weird they didn't let you in on the script with Luis Pineda and just cut you off mid interview. I will say perhaps be more selective with the company you keep, some people aren't meant for your blessings. Keep going up mate and never let them play you against yourself
"deji cant land right now" *gets every jab dodged*
i fw swarmz hella, hella entertaining
Love your music and now seeing u boxing and being one of the most honest person in the YouTube boxing scene I love it
Swarmz is too entertaining lol
Still lost when deji took a break for 3 months 💀
do you want to fight ksi still ?
madman madman madman
As much as I don’t think his good at boxing atm I defo think he has the potential and dedication
Most improved - Swarmz is the goat
Fam you improved incredibly keep it on you heading to the top ❤ ❤❤
The videos are so entertaining, he belongs in the youtube scene
Swarmz, love from australia!
So proud of you Swarmz, in such great shape and you’ve made so much progress. Big inspiration, hope to see you in the ring again
I have so much respect for you Swarmz, keep your chin up mate you’ve done extremely well for your third fight and we are all proud of u ❤ keep it going G love the dedication :)
iam a deji fight but keep going bro your really good you have power
You need to fight anthony taylor
SWARMZ vs fouzey should be a banger
As a deji fan,  you have my respect and you said that at the stare off deji is scared I disagree on that one i think both of you are on your A game and I wanna see you fight again. Keep up man!!!💪💪
put some respect to Deji's name
Respect swarmz. Keep getting better
When's the new album coming?
here me out....                                                                                                                 viddal riley in misfits....
mad respect for swarms aint gonna back down from shit and will put his all into it
Yo never seen this side of swarmz he`s got character, makes for a good youtuber. Make some actual videos they might bang.
Swarmz is actually my favorite fighter now like fr he has improved so much I’m so glad he didn’t quit after the KSI fight ong he has fr become a beast. Imo Swarmz has more potential than Deji and Swarmz looked more impressive
I can’t lie, Deji definitely won all those rounds but you have shown you trained hard for the fight and you definitely got better.
Respect for swarmz 📈📈 He has improved a lot quickly excited to whats nxt for him wanna see win fosure
That boom was half Dejis head movement. As he was slipping away you clipped him, took the brunt off the punch but still moved him off balance and shocked him.
Swarmz “Lack of experience” Scott
At the end of the day, you lost.  Enjoy your highlights but focus on progress.
Bro your counters are mad
Deji beat the greatest of all time!! Watch out tyson fury
Na king... You have done a fantastic job. Getting nervous, freezing and making mistake is part of the process. You will get better in ring IQ and other aspects with time. Keep your head up king.
jeez this instrumental 🔥🔥🔥
I was subbed to swamz since 3.7k beat that
LOL
Swarmz the goat
R.I.P? more like Remain In your Place. bro, stick to rapping 😂 your a trash fighter and boxer
🔥🔥
Good Fight Bro ❤
you did not get the first round 6:00
How are you giving yourself the 1st round lol. Lost all 4 blud.
swarmz didnt win a singele round at all but respect 💯
I would say that after this important experience gained, he would defeat 80% of misfits undercards
Got pummeled
Rip swarmz but honestly good shit
ONG u have potential bro stay in the ring  big ups
i hope we'll see that race you promised against deji lmao
You had no chance against Deji  He was the better man and did put a beating on you Keep ur chin up your new to this game you have potential
swarmz did really good especially considering hes only been training for 8 months
Bro you just fought someone with +5 fights, someone that gave Floyd Mayweather a red eye, someone that knocked out a fit/giant af Fousey.  Keep going broo
People can make all the memes they want, but at the end of the day. GIVE 👏THIS👏MAN👏HIS👏FLOWERS👏. He's always had very challenging fights and he's still been doing this for less than a year. MUCH RESPECT TO THE MADMAN!!!!
what fitted cap is dat
Bro keep ur chin up, the only fights you have won were HARD! Ryan Taylor was one fight at your level and you SMOKED HIM
I can tell you really fw the sport keep up the hard work man that’s great
Respect
pineda vs swarms is a face vs face but it would be entertaining
Bro get a new thumbnail maker
Love to see your genuine dedication to the sport of boxing. Keep going!
I don’t think you won the first round my opinion though
Mad man 😤
Bro got dominated and fought with poo in his ass and still can’t be humble
Sorry you had to come out to boos, but you are right, you have earned respect. Absolute legend.
U would smoke chase and Pineda at the same time💯💯💯💯💯🐐🐐🐐🐐
Keep going man, you’ve had 3 hard fights and you’ve improved so much, like you said you just need some more experience to learn from your mistakes and come back stronger cause you’re a fast learner, you’ve had an incredible transformation and I only see you getting better from here cause you’re hardworking and you’ve got natural talent💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
swarmz cant actually believe deji was scared of him 😂😂
Keep leveling up! 💯💪🏼
Bro your mental strength, self-critism, hopefulness for the future, and overall positivity are admiring. Can't wait to see you dominate the scene soon!
I can confirm deji was not scared. He was well aware of the experience gap. But swarmz you did well in the fight. You did land some solid bombs. And on the right person you could easily sleep someone
study with fight and work on your mistakes you got this next one you mad man
He‘s actually helarious
I want to see you two have another fight!!
he gets u in the corner, if u had given 1 good uppercut could've been dead.
One punch man🙌
Deji won all for u was on the backfoot on the first how can u say he won that
Your body transformation is inspiring.
man you did great keep it up
This L means nothing swarms. Well keep supporting you.
swarmz you gotta fight bryce hall next
I'm sick of these "as a fan of deji" comments bro no one cares stop sucking swarmz off he was shit all he had was speed
stop bein delusional it was deji all rounds
Ngl u landed some tough shots on deji lol
6:38 i love how swarmz can roast himself 😂😂😂humble man, reminds me of ksi with making fun of his own Ls
You should fight pineda, bdave, ice posedion, brandon buckingham, dk money, someone on ur experience level 🔥
Not getting put out and landing some clean flush shots on deji was impressive
U were so improved man
Look bro don’t take this to heart. Your not experienced enough you’ve fought only people with experience dude. Keep up swarmz u didn’t even look bad
BIG UPS to swarmz man it ain’t easy gettin in there with someone you know has more time in it. But you know at heart he just a private school kid with private school money trainers! Lol
I mean we all knew Deji would win, its crazy people thought that this was a 50:50 fight, I believe even Swarmz knew it in the back of his mind that Deji will smoke him because if he really thought he could defeat Deji with his current skill level, he has to be crazy to think that, but still respects to him for putting in the hardwork, he improved a lot from the JJ fight and respect to Deji to be nice to him the whole time even though Swarmz was trying to be disrespectful, Deji still remained humble and then later on humbled Swarmz, but I am sure Swarmz will improve, he just need to stop calling out people far above his level who are more experienced, Pineda would be a better and even matchup.
nah man you out did deji in a way to me. yes deji won but bro youve had 3 tough fights and you did VERY WELL in this fight
It’s impossible to have anything but respect for this man, he might have no wins but he goes for the best opposition for his level of experience. You’ll be great a year form now I can feel it
Swarmz I'd like to see you fight again bro ❤
It seems like you had good counter punching but when you did your mind basically told you return some hits and get him off you which is probably why you never capitalized when you could’ve got the upper hand
amazing shape swarmz💪
you're actually a chill guy, and you've got lots of potential, keep going bro
Swarms! You came from not knowing how to box to getting in amazing shape And good skill relatively speaking in less time than most youtube fighters! Keep it up man you had a great fight against deji who’s been in the game for a good amount of time.  You have great potential I see it in you
I honestly thought you’d get slept like round 2. But, you really impressed me. If you were more aggressive I think you would have easily won. Everyone’s talking about how good Deji was but he wasn’t really impressive for someone who’s been boxing for 5 years now. You rocked him twice in that fight. I think if you were more aggressive you would be somewhere on Salt Papis level, your counter shots were peak.
Can you address what Leon and Daley were saying to you during the face off after the weigh in?
all 4 rounds to deji easily
damn you got bullied horribly the whole match
So many excuses dude be more real u put up a great fight came out with the L wich means u need more work but i dont understand the Caps and delusion that come from you ur a bigger man than that at least i think u are hopefully u see this and prove me wrong and come out with the W next fight
30kg in 5 months 🤯
You improved a lot. You went from ballerina to showing fast jabs and good feet movement. Keep it up.
1:09 Deji wasn't scared. He was legit giving you the Mike Tyson death stare at 1:04. 😂
You have to give it to Swarmz. To go from being a musician featured on JJ's album to fighting him on two weeks notice, loosing and being memed, fighting and beating Ryan Taylor, and fighting Deji whilst putting in a pretty solid effort for his experience level against a guy who had just fought Floyd Mayweather, is pretty friggen admirable. And now, not only is he hella entertaining and promoting the fights well with his diss tracks (as bad or good as they may be), but he's trying his best to fit in to this scene, which he wasn't all that familiar with at this time last year, by now reacting to the fight. You really have to give it to him.
keep it up you've improved sm keep it up
i was rooting for u bro them hoes was comingg 😭😭😭😭you getting better u really my favorite in the scene ong
Swarmz vs myth?
All the respect in the world for you swarms, but Deji not scared of you. He’s schooled you I think it was the other way around but keep your chin up you will get better from this
chin up swarmz
-
keep training swarmz i was joking around before saying you the goat but u actually have potential to be a threat to influencer boxing
yo i rate swarmz you know i really respect the guy
you have improved but i thought you would be a little bit more humble with the reaction can’t lie. within two minutes saying that deji was scared and that he ‘only hit me with about 2 shots the whole fight’ he genuinely smoked you and dominated over 4 rounds, but fair enough you have improved though.
i like ya swarms, but only two of dejis shots connected? what fucking world are you living in, he connected with body shot after body shot, he was picking you apart, 8 round fight youd be KO'd done, finished, and stop acting like a pillok, you give off ksi vibes, get real. you give the first round to yourself? LOL bruv come off it, deji won every single round lmfao Also, you keep saying deji been training for 5+years???? honestly youre deluded LOL hes been training 3 years on and off i just want to state again, you did not win the first round. you said after your counters, you didnt follow up, thats because you were FUCKED from the body shots, then you said you could have won? i cant anymore, youve lost a fan, youre taped in the head, living in swarms world, lmfao what a muppet
each fight you are improving a lot!! You did well 💖 you will come back stronger I’m sure of it!
Hahahah bro was saying ‘man I kept catching him with the jab it’s derrr man watch’ then sits watching waiting for him to throw a punch😂😂 that was jokes🤣 w swarmz man
nah ful respect to swarmz, its sick seeing people come into the game and respect their opponent and want to get better. big up, gl for next fight
The fact people even thought you could win shows how much you’ve improved and how much you can promote a fight😂 no matter what you’re a winner bro and I’m here for it
Let’s gooo swarms I was rooting for you brother
10:49 bro that was lack of experience at that point. In your next fight I guarantee you will be less likely to make that mistake. Aside from that, your growth in this sport is amazing. Keep grinding and you will be the one to talk about. Although you don't need it I'm subscribing. Good luck with all you do.
Fantastic guy and great promoter but you need to get more warm up fights 🤷🏾‍♀️
Really well done m8 only advices I got is don’t always try and get straight out maybe try getting some combos in rather than jab and straight out I recon u might of got a knock down if u stayed in and get a couple more combos and break down the body
swarmz running away from Pineda, hilarious
keep doing your thing bro
All swarmz gotta do is keep progressing . Big ups too him or goin for the better boxers tho  ksi , deji and maybe pineda next 🤣
I love both deji and swarmz not ksi
Keep grinding bro with the little expierence you have you have done better than most of them starting boxing back in the day and you bring entertainment i am sure you can do very well  in the future!
It's okay bro you're just ass at boxing ❤
"Deji's shots weren't hurting me" yeah coz you spent 85% of the fight with your hands up covering yourself...  😂
Honeslty massive inspiration should b so proud of u didn’t freeze up it would of been a. Different fight but cmon this time next year your gonna be a beast
Deji and swarmz vs pineda and pdave
Respect, swarmz taking better fights than KSI
Swarmz needs to stop fighting lol 🗑
Misfits should’ve let him finish his interview just seemed like they didn’t respect him. But they will probably just trying to hype up another fight
My goat, there's always next time.
Now rewatching all 4 rounds I think you did take the first round srry mt biased side of me was dick riding deji a lil but the rest I think he won
You gonna go and strangel that thin ass guy VAMOS
Please don’t stop, you have some great skill for the time you’ve being doing this, 6 more months and I can see an insane swarmz
Respect to swarmz soo proud of you we need to see you back in the ring
Aaa damn. Just gained respect of that reactions
I actually wanted to see you win seeing how motivated you are and how far you had come from the ksi fight. Keep it up champ if you had same amount of experience I think you would definitely have won.
You hit him but it doesn't hurt him.
Use more uppercuts and than youre hard to beat
Deji fans are so respectful
dude is straight ass lmaoo stop talkin 💀😭
WE LOVE SWAMRZ‼️💯🔥🔥
Fight DK money that’s an easy fight
with more work and training on the timing and spacing of boxing, swarmz could really be dangerous.  He has very quick punch combinations, and very quick hands and movements. Hope he keeps going with misfits, he could really be up there if he continues to practice his timing and boxing spacing knowledge.
imagine saying a nigga was scared after he beat your ass
If you threw more punches you'd of smoked him.  U need a comeback fight now, get out there and smoke pineda😂😂😂😂
Swarmz is jokes man😂
My man looks like Zaha
Man's got potential . 💯
I thought you'd do better after all that talk. You just covered up and only threw random punches while backing up
Swarmz vs Pineda is Main Event material ngl
Take a shot every time you see “as a deji fan” in the comments
Great stuff! I'm looking forward to you stepping in the ring again! I was rooting for Deji since I've been a fan of his for awhile but I have a lot of respect for you.
I love how he said 'come on mate' in such an australian accent switching it up with this uk
I gotta give, you respect for stepping on the ring. But come on man every punch, you land you get hyped up like you knocked Mohammed Ali you did nothing you were standing in the corner doing nothing and first round wasn’t yours you are just on denial
Hi
Are you gonna fight more aggressively?
U were a perfect test for deji to be fair and yall made it entertaining, keep ur head up!!
So proud of you Madman, your defense was good and your handspeed is incredible ! everytime you threw you landed so capitalize on that and keep it pushing ! Also you're my fav lad and i can't wait to see you climbing the ladder to greatness
youll come back better
Deji ain’t scared of you lil bro 😭
Swarmz has mad potential. Natural athlete and quick learner with boxing. Keeps his guard up, good footwork, nice jab and looks to counter. With more time he's gonna develop and be a problem in the boxing scene 👊🏼🥊💯
You are so deluded man 😂
Swarmz vs. Pineda would break the internet
Bro, these excuses in this video are absolutely insane. You got smacked around the ring the WHOLE fight bruddah...
It is also very important to know that after the Mayweather fight, Deji took THREE months off and played catch up to get ready for this fight... He was at 60%... If he was at 100%, Swarmz would be on the floor.
Also… deji was not scared 😂
man said pineda vs swarmz, well ksi is gonna enjoy this one
honest opinion, i feel both you and deji did really well and put a good fight on. excited to see you both fight on more cards keep up the good work bro crazy transformation big ups
swarmz v pineda is a main event
Fr but stop being all talk man, get better and come back stronger.
U trash
Man buy a microphone, so annoying hearing that background sound every time you talk😂
Bro if you're not proud of yourself then you're truly mad! Have you seen how much you've improved? Only 3 fights against way more experienced fighters....like LITERALLY! Nah big up fam! Keep going and you're going to be trouble!
Proud of Swarmz … 🎉😂
good healthy way of thinking my g
Speed in the counters though
ur left hook is fast imo just throw more volume punches and you're good
I love you swarmz don't stop you got talent you should continue boxing I know you can smash a lot of fighters
Swamp don’t forget to delete the diss track 😂
Big fan! W Swarmz.
1:10 No... No he definitely was not "scared" Swarmz...
I’d strangle that flamingo I’m deadddd
Even though you lost, you worked hard and that’s all that matters! If you keep your work ethic, you will reach the most destructive version of yourself. Don’t stop working hard, g!
People say that Deji lost against Alex because he didn’t throw  But no one says anything about if you threw more you could’ve won
this geeser is jokes
The lot of man with cliche  instead of block but ur sudden peekaboo  is actually  decent might KO young deji clean
Deji is actually one of the best Technical boxers in the scene man don't feel bad for losing. You get more experience and you'll be in the top fr man
Bro thinks he done something 💀💀💀💀
Swarmz V Pineda Both lost to KSI Both won their next fight  it that doesnt say anything i dont know what does
9:51 damn that was a shoot
Swarmz does have potential in boxing. even though Deji didnt do well taking 3 months but still made Deji one of the people that would smoke everyone at full potential and swarmz made him work
You could’ve very easily beat Deji just the cardio and experience
Swarmz with the 🔥🔥 counters. Big up man,  you really got hella potential, and to think it's not even been up to a year nd he's this active. Naaah
i love how swarmz handles this, unlike others who are down after a loss. he directly looks forward for the next fight and is happy
Nah man I love you Swarmz you’re moving mad with your progress, keep it up.
I think Alex Wasabi would be a good fight for swarmz  Vamossss works 2
Swarmz is sl funny man big respect to him taking tougher fights with his weight loss can't wait to see him back.
1:06 DID MY MAN JUST SAID DEJI WAS SCARED LMFAOOOOOOO AFTER HE JUST EMBARRASSED YOU IN A FIGHT LOL AND WHY WOULD DEJI BE AFRAID OF YOU SWARMZ WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR HIM TO BE AFRAID OF YOU LMFAOOOOOOO HE FOUGHT FLOYD MAYWEATHER HE'S FOUGH JAKE PAUL HE WOULDNT BE AFRAID OF YOU LOL
blaming experience throughout the whole video... don't fight someone experienced then. Simple.
Keep it up, Swarmz! You looked great in there
release some sparring vids bro im trying to see if you actually let your hands go in sparring. I feel like you have the hunger and mentality but just need to let your hands go.
You did well dude. Excited to see you fight again.
Big improvement fr💯
Swarmz ur just some clown 😂😂😂😂😂 u cnt fight for nothing …. about madman …. Fooooooool
Swarmz ur just some clown 😂😂😂😂😂 u cnt fight for nothing …. about madman …. Fooooooool
😂😂😂😂😂 swarmz ur wet u can’t fight for nothing how u even proud of this 😂😂😂😂 u got no hands u pussio
Gotta give you respect man. For someone that’s been doing it for about a year you have got a lot of potential. Deji is a skilled fighter and you brought the fight to him!!
I’m sorry but I doubt deji was scared during the face off. He was just very serious. But you surprised me with your jab and counter punches at times.
You won the 1st round, but weren’t active enough for the final 3 rounds.
Start taking lower fights take Ryan and Pineda fight beat both and maybe fight slim
cuts out the part in round 2 where he gets bombaclated
Big up man, the progress is there, keep at it boy!
respect to swarmz but he is so biased
Never change Swarmz. This humility and dedication you've been showing is inspirational. Can't wait to see your next fight. Dare I say get in the ring with PINEDA?
W Swarmz
I actually believed in Swarmz since the KSI fight, and its cap to say that he hasnt improved... My man been putting in hours of work in boxing, and i deffo respect the grind😤
What happened to wanting to ends dejis career? And not wanting to see him back in misfits? Looks like he actually was built like that ngl 😂
😂
you have a good amount of reach if u went  for the jab more u woulda won or at least had more success
If you keep training you're going to be a big problem for a lot of the guys.
Good stuff man, keeping this attitude towards your fights will give you a massive advantage over many who are probably afraid to lose.
Swarmz i love u but he was not scared i could tell.
You did great considering the experience difference, I was rooting for Deji but you have some serious power that he had to respect when you threw. You’ll be back stronger bro, trust 👍
Bro I’m sorry but u didn’t win any of the rounds
I was really really impressed tbf, didnt expect you to be this on point! You have a bright boxing scene ahead of you!
Deji moving like Goku
Respect to swarmz but DEJI won all 4 rounds …. But tbf when I rocked him if u pushed him back and let ur hands go u could of finished it there cuz DEJI got rocked
Bro got pieced up
Deji lost 3 times before getting his first dub. Be proud, mad man.
Honestly bro. No more Boos when you come out. You’re a true entertainer, keep grinding💯
Entertaining before the fight humble in defeat can’t fault you
Talked too much told boy he wasnt built like that and got your ass whooped private school boy beat you
Had a good performance you're definitely nowhere near bad keep going big man
Hey fouzie vs swarmz maybe
Excited for the Pineda fight !
You should fight Ginty. The guy that Devin Haney is ducking
time to churn out views
bro had pooo in his ah 😫
Reacting so that he does not look like a loser💀. There is so many if in this video.
It looks like that private school was built like that lmao 😂
GGs brother, your hard work showed. you just need more experience to start implementing stuff and understanding the game. take that vamos fight, its not super easy
L Swarmz
Brother.... you are a grown ass man... take the stickers of your hat
fair play to swarmz. he went in there with someone with twice as many fights as him and actually didn't look awful. I'd love to see him fight Ashley Rak-Su
Big respect for swarms I knew he was going to lose but I didn’t know he would lose in a good way if that makes sense respect
Let’s not forget KSI was hitting Swarmz clean when they fought and did not wobble him or knock him out just off balance. Swarmz can be a real threat if he keeps at it.
Deji wasn't scared
Damaged ego lol
You did better then any of you’re fights, but deji won every round.
Impressed
Big up man. Personal improvement is key to life
You keep on getting the hardest fights thats why you lost
MAD MAN! you done really well considering the significant experience differential. honestly, give it a bit more time and you will be one of the best in the scene no doubt.
Bro raging on devmorre mate and bugzy malone bec he lost. Bro said postives😂😂😂
Big up swarmz  your only going to get better Bro like you said, this type of content is needed a proper switch up compared to the music ting bless up my guy.
Yet more clowns making a mockery of the sport
SWARMZ IS MY GOAT 🐐🐐🐐
You cant do nothing but love this guy, humble and funny at the same time. And the most important of all disciplined asf, improved alot these months. Do some more sparring and you will be good
Swarmz is such a cool mfk bro, manz juss talks hella shit😂💯
Whatever you think of Swarmz, you have to admit he belongs in this scene. He knows how to promote and be entertaining for someone who's just 8 months deep into this scene. Big up brother 💪
👏 good fight bro
If you were on offense even just a little you would have won but you never was on offense, only deji was on the offensive the whole time.
Strangle that flamingo, Vamos 😂
He wasn't an inch scared of you don't chat shit😂
keep doing more content u are very likeable to watch
You’re trash cuz
I'll always say this: "My grandparents had Ali, my parents had Tyson, and I have Swarmz"
I think your high guard is the best I’ve seen in Misfits. That high guard is TIGHTTT.
#RESPECT
1:03 swarmz looked SCARY
He was trying to dodge any other shots he wasn’t rocked
Teust the process Swarmz ❤
Fucking hell! You have improved a lot. NeXT fight you will fuck upp pineda fs
You got fast hands.. thats what suprised me  Just work on your craft bro and dedicate yourself even more
👏👏✨️🫶 Swarmz next time  🥊 it's only just the start of big good things to  come 💪
13:40 stfu bro you couldn’t win anything expect the loosing competition
Y’all can joke that he lost but 3 hard fights in less than a year is crazy, especially since he had to rebuild fitness at the same time so the technique will hopefully click for Swarmz soon.LETS GO MADMAN 😤
dw bro we know u threw  the fight, hope the payday  was worth it to lose to deji.. i bet u was gassed up "he fought mayweather u no" AHAHAHAHAHAH neek
cant wait for your next fight
man swarmz is a legend bro to see how far he has come since the ksi fight bro man is incredible man learn from the loss and come back better even better bro.
This was the realest reaction anyone has made to their fight 💀 Big ups Swarmz, come back soon!!!!!
you couldve won fr just work on following theough with combos on those counters you will DESTROY your next opponents if u get that down
I mean yeah you did good, but Deji is not just good a grabbing you he was also just the better boxer. Just saying dont down play his skills or you just lying to yourself
Pineda’s getting slept
I can’t lie you did your thing bro, carry on
u did good
this brudda loses and straight up goes like "oh well", good on bro.
need a song congratulating deji keep the consistency
Literally an inspiration to a lot of people , good to see this kind of energy , got ur self a big fan mate 😊
Bro this is only the beginning. KEEP GOING MY G
Bruh, excuses, excuses.... Fuck the excuses off man. Deji just a hell of a lot better than you thats why you lost. Deji turned you into a punching bag with ease. Also only 2 of dejis hits got you? LMAO he was beating you to a pulp... 2 hits only got you... why you lying bro? Acting like bare cameras weren't on you watching everything hahaha
Defiantly need to work on your cross but you look bread for this sport keep up the hard work.
No way you got the first round but ups onn transformations. Everything you did was gd i just think your mentality wasant there's.  You putting yourself in your corner can be a gd thing butnyou lack the iq to know how tonuse it
Delusional guy. Yeah, Deji only landed 2 punches but won by unanimous decision. 🤣🤦‍♂️
I legitimately enjoy seeing you improve, and I like your ability to squash everything after the conflict too. Giving Deji and KSI their flowers, and your win against Ryan Taylor, you're learning and you're on your way. Lovely stuff, very excited and I really hope you continue cause you look sharp bro
Now youve got the physique pressure out of the way, now is the time to really hone in your boxing technique, if you dedicate yourself to perfecting your timing, i worry for your next opponent
did he called him DOFLAMINGO PINEDA🤣🤣🤣
bro makes every disstrack and ends up losing, this nigga needs to be humbled ibsr
Swarmz Is Now Beaten By The Olatunji Brothers. 1 From KSI and Another From Deji... ( Unseen Comment )
You went for Deji too early, I'm thinking you go fight Temperrr or Wassabi and then rematch Deji.
Keep up the good work bro
I wish everyone can take a loss like Swarmz🖤
You did so well and come so far! Proud of you and your physical is great
bro please get rid of the blac brim 😭
Bros making so many excuses at the start
Keep it up bro. You're great at selling fights. Just be humble and always maintain your A-Game
u got outworked 40-36 style
Even when you lost, I would love to see you again back in the ring stronger 💪🏽
Nice diss track
W swarmz
U came in there and put up a fight bro the madman will be back!
Deji Dominated you from the beginning to the end
9:50 that punch was clean🔥 Fighting someone with 5 years experience with only 6 months of training yourself. You did good bruh keep working hard and you could be at the top in yt boxing but lets be real, you aint win a single round fam lmao
Folks u got yo ass beat 😭😭😩
Honestly bro it felt like the six pack got to your head man you fell in love with the better shape you were in and was punished for your arrogance
bro you jus fought an og in youtube boxing and took him to the distance and arguably landed more cleaner shots, you finna be hell in these next fights keep going bruv
Did he say demi was scared of him??!!!😂😂😂😂 🤦
This vid is hilarious!!!
I’m so proud of you man ❤️ For 8 months you did incredible against someone with 5 years! I seriously cannot wait for your next fight, your mentality, your dedication, your determination, incredible 🔥🔥🔥
Bro Deji was not scared of you 😂😂
Let's go swarmz.  You have a lot of potential man.
It’s crazy Swarmz journey on boxing started from that tik tok live😂
Your just like my main sparring partner. Decent jab, decent combinations, kinda flat footed but solid. What you need to work on is :    not being put into full guard and getting cornered that easy, more versatile combinations, better slips, better boxing iq and be more aggressive.
Keep doing it man, you did so much better than the first fight and you have the fundamentals down more than many of the other fighters.
No more talking from u man u trash
It was a good fight it was actually jarring tho because i fuck with both of yall lol
You need to train longer between fights
Madman
As a deji fan I have a LOT of respect to you I hope to see you keep growing in the scene😂
you got humbled. Thought you was ending deji 😂😂
Damn we for sure need to see a rematch in the future
9:51 The punch didn't almost drop Deji but you did catch him off guard and he tried to roll under it
Pineda hit swarmz with some friendly fire
I’m sorry swarmz i love you but deji wasn’t scared he fought Floyd mayweather FLOYD MAYWEATHER!!! one of the best boxers in the world
Swarms improving faster then Ksi no cap
You got ts next time bro ❤❤
I don’t care bro swarmz is the true mad man and he’s funny🤣 man keeps it honest too
Deji not being able to finish you is a dub alone deji been in the gym and still ass
Deji won every round but you improved massively
Your ego is what got you. You tried to land that 1 punch knockout again (at the very start) like deji wasnt expecting that then once you realised that wasnt gonna work you did fuck all for the rest of the fight basically
Was a tough one cause youre 2 guys i wanna see do big things in the scene
Happy these losses don't make you give up hopefully one day you'll get a rematch
Madman stick to diss tracks
Stop boxing
👑👑👑🐐🐐🐐
Don't make no more diss tracks
I will say a draw was bettter deji was not punching or landing shots @swarmz ur real one doing ur thing bro 💯💯 next fight is a W
You fought well, you had some nice counters. I'm looking forward seeing your next fight!
INCOMING GOAT VS GOAT
Your boxing has defo improved. And I tell you what, you defo increased your Blocking skills. You got DEFENSE mastered man, next is practicing the OFFENSE skill. Good luck dude, you are doing well.
fairs
He wasn’t scared gang
wym deji was scared lmao
Hes so egotystical
I’m happy swarms got into shape 🎉🎉🎉
Yall dumb for syain he gave deji a hard time 😂
W Man U will  Come back stronger  🎉
Ngl your ego got over you
You're the goat man, come back stronger next time! Looking forward to seeing you against Pineda!
Bro you were good all you have to do is let your hands go! Defense was on point but you didn't attack unless you were against the ropes and when you did attack you were missing and it was sloppy instead of setting it up...but he felt that power that's why he backed up everytime u hit him
He was "scared" and u still lost
This was awesome swarmz keep your chin up
W
Respect man keep goin and follow your fists
You actually improved ALOT given the time you have had, idk if people realize that. Literally the difference between you and Deji is experience.
You did great, lad! Deji is very experienced in comparison to you, yet you still got in the ring and went toe to toe
Guy shut up, that guy battered you, the video says it all, you were in the corner because DEJI pressured you to.  DEJI won all the rounds mr Swarmz  Take the loss man, you got better but you were battered all this excuse are pissing me off lol
Calling him scared when you admitted to freezing up the majority of the fight is wild 💀admit you lost graciously not this garbage
W defence already decent, learn to escape the corners and get comfortable in countering u gon be solid!
Bro wtf is this thumbnail. Get a better editor man
Mad respect to you bro
Bro tell ksi put me on I will fight you anytime
pineda smokes you in 2
You actually done damn good, i wasn't rooting for you to win at all but you actually showed real skill from the amount of time you have been fighting, impressive fr.
Let's go Swarmz 🤙 keep grinding and work on your footwork your naturally explosive
WAIIIIIIIITTTTT A SECONDD! who asked?
Madman
a totally different fighter since the ksi fight, brilliant work keep it up.
Yu needed to let yo hands gooo
you should make your self a caracter with a godcomplex
SWARMZ VS PINEDA WE NEED THIS
Goat
You are so delusional.
Lets go mad man!
You looked good in there!! Im excited to see you again
Icl deji won each round 🤣🤣
The amount of excuses you made in this is ridiculous
Keep your chin up man, you’ve only had 3 fights with nothing but hard fights, pressure makes diamonds and time makes legends
The deluded man 😂😂😂
Bro proper fight, cant wait to see you fight again, deji just had that bit more exsperience
Madman
i respect you swarmz and think you'll go along way in YouTube boxing, but quit being so delusional and put more respect on dejis name
There’s so many potential matches for swarmz
i was disapointed  tbh
if deji was the best he should have taken swarmz out but didnt
Great effort and your skill is getting better Deji just got the best of you but keep ya head up and keep fighting
Swarmz vs Zanetti😅
Lol Deji annihilated you fight Dcanmoney next.
madmanmadman
Love seeing a swarms vid always quality content. Respected this guy from the start, cant wait for your next fight.
Swarmz vs Ed Matthews would be a good co main

W madman 🔥
sImPLe aS
You got a good and humble attitude in defeat which I respect
Swarmz bro u got this just stay humble and dedicated
You fought well he just has more experience. Get an easier fight to KO someone and gain experience

Madman Madman
You'll be back strong fam 🙏💪
Goated
It’s a yes from me.
its not just exp cause ppl like ksi dont do what deji does its just deji is good at defnece and has good techinque which can be due to exp but dont just put it all under exp
You’re my favourite influencer boxer hold your head up high
swarmz finna smoke Pineda no cap🤚🏼
You didn't do that bad even though you were getting destroyed
He’s been fighting since the beginning of the influencer boxing and you started less than a year ago and still created a struggle for him u can bounce back from this
MADMAN WWARMZ
Take the fight to the streets bro
🥊👀🍿😂
PATTEN THE THUMBNAIL UP NIGGA
Tbh you looked decent
Normally whenever Deji fights someone i always side with him but this fight i was so unsure as i really do love the both of em. Also big up swarmz dont give up u got this 💪
ngl tho mans punches got deji sleep on the nets
MADMAN
Deji is a better boxer than ksi change my mind :
