Oh (The frozen one, the chosen one) (I'm nothin' like these niggas) uh Livin' the life, takin' chances I done some shit in the street that I won't take for granted I never had thoughts of a Grammy I was too stuck in the trap to know rap was my talent We weigh 'em up, get 'em out, then we stackin' Used to steal cars just to cut off the traction Big body foreign, you see us in traffic We kept the heat, never froze on no action No, they ain't believe us, I made this shit happen Remember opp huntin', shit slowed down my trappin' Now in the mansion, feet kicked up, relaxin' Balenci' runners, put down the new Bally I kept it real, never told on nobody These niggas fold on the gang like a pallet I keep a bankroll for them days I didn't have it In the trap house they treat me like Your Majesty (on God) She up in my phone right now Texting, "Baby, is you by yourself right now?" Oh She up in my phone right now Texting, "Baby, is you by yourself right now?" Oh She up in my phone right now Texting, "Baby, is you by yourself right now?"

I remember when he had them lil bitty chains on when he first started rapping he really got it out the mud that's the saddest part...addiction is a mf especially when you in the trenches it was probably hard to shake that mindset. I hate this sm 😞 all my friends would be like "you listen to him I can't even understand what he saying" talking about his accent 🤣 but I understood every word...he had it. This is truly some shit 😮‍💨🤦🏾‍♀️💔 my condolences to his family, his gf and all his true friends

Been waiting on dis on god🔥
I’m glad asl he released an extended version
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming

Shit A Vibe Fr🥶
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake. Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he conquered death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ;  Except a gift can either be accepted or rejected..So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment; don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/1432117742/ref=emc_b_5_mob_i

If youn drop this shit On Apple Music Cuhz😂😂😂
Please read my testimony: I have had a ton of encounters with God. For example he has saved my life a TON of times. Been hit by a 🚗 as a little girl, been in a burning 🚗, Been in a ton of car accidents in general... I guess you can say I have a history with vehicles lol. 😂😂 But each time I walked away without a scratch. Many times when I could have died God would lead me to know what to do and he would save my life. The Holy Spirit would speak to me. In general as I draw closer to God, I can hear when he speaks to me including he has warned me of many things before they happen. Including on 12/31/2019 as I was celebrating new yrs he kept telling me this yr would be very prophetic, I kept hearing those words over and over again. And I had a heaviness in my ❤, I knew it wasn't going to be good but something bad...it made me not want 2020 to start. We have for sure seen all that has taken place in 2020 with covid and natural disasters etc... And I see these things lining up with Bible prophecy... I have so many testimonies of how God has works in my life... That there is NO WAY I could EVER DENY HIM!!! He gives me peace and comfort in all my challenges in life and he leads my life path and as I TRUST in HIM ALONE.... He always takes care of me and shows me his great love for me!!! I would encourage you to pray and ask God to reveal himself to you and if you seek him with your ENTIRE HEART I know he will show you he is VERY REAL!! Jesus Christ is My King of Kings, Lord of Lords!!! One way to know if God of the Bible is real is to read Revelations and see what is taking place also read Matthew 24 in KJV bible. Ask God to give you eyes to see and ears to hear what The Holy Spirit is saying!!! The mark of the beast will be implemented soon in Rev. Chapter 13 of the Bible and people need to choose Jesus Christ as their savior and repent, believe in him alone and invite the Holy Spirit into their lives before the judgements start...because by default if you don't choose Jesus Christ you choose Satan. Many believe there are many ways to God. But the Bible says you can only get to the Father through his son Jesus Christ and his gift of dying for us and believe in the finished work on the cross!! I am praying for you and anyone reading this to please take my WARNING serious and know this comes from a place of LOVE in my heart for you!!!! 🙏💐💝😊
shit was so good nigga hadda make a video for it

THE TRUTH! Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth. John 17:17    Jesus Prays for All Believers  20 “I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who [j]will believe in Me through their word; 21 that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me. 22 And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one: 23 I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me. John 17:20-23    The True Vine !!! 15 “I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. 2 Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He [a]takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit. 3 You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. 4 Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. John 15

When this going on Apple Music?
Hey 💜I hope you’re having a great day.  Hopefully this comment gives you hope. The state of the world is alarming. Many people feel uneasy about everything that’s going on. The root of every single problem is evil aka sin. Any of us could die any second but where would we go after? Well, because of our sin and evil ways, we deserve to go to hell. The Bible states in Romans 6:23 “For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” BUT WAIT! I have some good news for you. God has offered us a chance to go to heaven and have everlasting life by sending his only Son Jesus Christ into the world to die on the cross for our sins. John 3:16 says “For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” That was a true display of love. Repent and Surrender your life to Christ today before it’s too late.
Thanks 🙏 Big brahh  #all love Here ,MSIP

1017 YESSSIRSKIII😤🐍💯
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3   PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers.
