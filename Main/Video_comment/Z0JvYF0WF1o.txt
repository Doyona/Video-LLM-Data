I live in argentina, and here "Blue raspberry" it's not really a thing. Not even our sour patch kids ripoff   uses it. It uses blueberry, Bubblegum, and lemon (it only comes in three colors) In fact, raspberry as a whole is not as popular as a flavor here. I've only ever seen it being used *twice* in candy. Only in Jello and Push-pops. But it's often asociated with pink. Strawberry is often red, Grape is purple, Watermelon is always green *and* pink.  "But then, which one is blue?" You might be wondering. For some reason that I'll never understand, *our* version of blue raspberry is pineapple. For some reason, argentine pineapple candy is blue. So for you, Blue tastes like raspberry, to me it tastes like Pineapple.
i like the beginning and i would say "blue"
He must’ve got blueberry

my solution:  BLUE RASPBERRY DOES NOT EXIST!!!! RASPBERRIES ARE REDDISH PINK! ALWAYS HAVE BEEN ALWAYS WILL BE! so just call it raspberry and color it blue, then blue can be blueberry, pink can be bubblegum, and red can be watermelon

About the grape flavor: according to Hank Green of Crash Course, CONCORD grapes - which the grape flavor is modeled after - have a much stronger flavor and do taste like the artificial version.
Next I want them to explain why there’s a flavour called hedgehog ( it’s not real hedgehog btw)
3:25 It's blue, it's a tasteable color

« Natural flavor » THE CANDY WAS BLUE RASPBERRY FLAVOUR
We like blue foods, we also like to eat foods that are toxic to most other animals. That tracks.
5:00 easy its regular red raspberry they just make the blue raspberry because they felt like there are less blue fruits hopefully that helps 😊
still waiting for the otterpops lore theory
I have heightened senses, excluding the sense of smell. I tried something that was blue raspberry flavored, in which I spit it out because I didn’t taste fruit.
Yes give us otter pops lore we will eat it up

Matpat thinking about doing a video on Otterpop lore is probably why he finally decided to quit.
I like red and blue slushy cause it’s delicious and I basically the whole rainbow is my favorite color
Yeah, and you could’ve said I got blueberry
I think blue raspberry is just a mix of raspberries and blue berries
Blueberry, Not Blue Raspberry
We’re not gonna talk about the mermaid yogurt scene no ok
12:33 I agree. Grape is so much better in Monster energy and Jolly Ranchers
For 14 years straight i thought they're real! Now I'm depressed :(

Personally blue raspberry candy makes me sick

I think I know what the flavor of blue grass is you know how red velvet tricks your smells to make it taste different even though it’s just chocolate dyed red well I think that’s what they do at blue raspberry. It’s actually just raspberry but they use a type of dye that makes it smell like blue raspberries so it taste like it, cause it tricks our brain.
Blueberries are purple
Before watching this video, I thought that the blue raspberry flavor was just raspberry and blueberry mixed together
Ha! Trick question. The flavour of blue is Smurf. Everyone knows that!

Blues in the corner like: "PuT mE iN COacH"
Please do a video on why “cream soda” is different colours around the world - clear or red in North America. Brown (like cola) in the UK. Green in South Africa… I bet other countries also mix it up!

I know this comment will be sent to the depths of the other 11K comments at the moment, but I got an M&M ad directly after he was done talking about M&M's.
I have a theory that it was created because in around 1970s I think they had a problem with red food dye and that it way cancer causing so they decided to make a red object blue instead
🫐blueberry flavor is still RED
Fanta makes a blue flavored soda lol

Hey, who is a bad color and most dangerous color then how about democracy ism and communism because the communist he was red under flag but the democracy people use blue flag so does that mean we are the enemies? The USSR is trying to save the world we stopped, the USSR, so why don’t we yes, because of blue and I want to say another to you think you’re smart saying this stuff I know something that’s very smart. It’s a syndrome syndrome. The most worse syndrome is called artery syndrome. Do you know about that sincerely artery syndrome artery syndrome it’s very intestinal intestinal iron that you need to eat from a tube. Yes, you heard that right eat from a tube tube to the stomach and the food go up to your your digestive system and the digestive system crunch it up but the stomach fraction the correct proper way so you need to need to have it connect to the guts and the end and it will go down so

"Raspberry" flavored candy Ingredients:Ethyl Maltol,Methyl Anthranilate,Isoamyl Acetate and Malic Acid
M&Ms colors history Red(1940-1970,1984-today) Orange(1970-today) Yellow(1940-today) Green(1940-today) Brown(1940-today) Blue(1998-today) Pink(1940-1948) Beige(1948-1998)
Fanta used to make blue soda and so did Pepsi It was just water,citric acid and food coloring with sugar
We have a natural blue food pigment called Spirulina. It is a bright reddish blue color mixed with yellow to make green
Blue raspberry is just artificial flavor with spirulina extracts
If M&Ms were fruit flavored Red=strawberry Orange=orange Yellow=lemon Green=lime Blue=grape Brown=peach
Blue is a weird color to eat In China blue is bubblegum flavored
Most raspberry flavors are red In China blue flavor is called "blueberry" which a blackish hue(made with spirulina)

The reason grape doesn't taste like grape is probably because grape juice ferments really, really easily. It's part of the reason why wine was one of the first alcoholic beverages to be discovered. We didn't have the power to serve straight-up grape juice as a beverage until the combination of increased chemistry knowledge and the growing temperance movement propelled it into being in the Victorian era. So it's no wonder that when making grape candies, people would not want to work with something that very easily turns into wine.
Are you friends with fynn
Just saying,red sour patch kids are better than blue sour patch kids
breaks into someone's house  😥Blue
Hi

blueberry
The blue raspberry is just a normal raspberry, but renamed and recolored with food coloring
I can see how blue is a warning colour  It doesn’t look appetising, no matter how pretty and how much my favourite colour it is
Blue being my favourite colour the intro made me laugh!  Blooo!
I'd say that blue raspberry is only popular because it's blue, not because it's raspberry
Otter*pops! Iore
Grape doesn't taste like grape, but it sure as heck tastes like purple
bluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue matpat having a mental breakdown

0:22 “blue :/ “  -head editor Dan
blue
guys its blueberries in disguise
blue flavor always tastes good, like sometime grapes are too string, cherries are too sour, strawberries taste like soap, but blue is that good sour semi sweet balance. it's probably because of my/our association of liking the flavor that makes it more palatable, as well as the consistent formula for a fake chemical taste. regardless though, it's the most trust worthy flavor
Blueberries
I have  wild berry Skittles and the blue flavor is raspberry so  you are correct
oh yeah, forgot food theory had a theme song  -2024 me

In the UK mostly Blue products mostly Bubble Gum Flavoured when it comes to like Slushies and what not.
nah cus it just tastes like ''Blue'' does it not 3:23
Sigma Dan 😎
What's kind of funny is Red was not the only health scare apparently. Blue also wound up causing health scares with what I've researched as well. Specifically "Blue 1". Some brands like smarties used Blue 1 but after the scare for that one they removed the blue version and later reintroduced it using a natural blue dye they got later instead of the old "brilliant blue" that Blue 1 introduced. Looking into different sources some say it might be bad, others say it might be ok. But only instance I've seen packaging mention "Blue 1" food dye was Calypso Ocian Blue Lemonade. Funny enough, one of my favourite beverages.

from my VERY limited research, this is actually Santi's first ever video in food theory in which he's listed as one of the writers in the description, gotta say that in less than a year he has managed to become the host of food theory is WILD. Just goes to show how much Matt trusts Santi and how much Santi knows about food, but big props to Brittany though for being one of the main writers of food theory before Santi

Matpat: what flavor did you get? Dan: bllluuuueeeeee Matpat: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
miss him
BLUEBERRY
Please do Otter Pop Lore. I need to know more about these characters.
there is technically something that's called "blue raspberry" in some parts of Canada...I've eaten it from a plant since it's not exactly sold places and you only find it in the wild, but it's just a different type of raspberry it's not the "blue" flavour
I disagree with blue being flavored blue raspberry because for some reason I associate blue with cold and mint with cold so I associate blue with mint
when i taste blue rasberry it tastes like banana to me and now i know why thanks
0:39
what did you call otter pops I called them push pops
Bro my brother is 17 and still to this day thinks blue raspberries come from fiji cause i told him they were native to the island when he was 6
Me watching a vid which was 9 months ago saying blueberries.
They just made it blue so it dident get confusing when you try to by strawbery or rezbery food's
Dan: blue.  Matpat: *literally has a mental crisis*
Blueberry+raspberry=blue rasberry
blue flavor 🗣️‼️🔥
I need otterpop lore
There is a type of grape in japan that tastes exactly like grape flavour. Not sure what it's called though
It tastes like blue.
Blackberry exists. Also WHY is strawberry flavour pink like its not pink.
Do you even have any proof the blue raspberries don’t actually exist out there? I mean obviously the flavor is not of them, but they could exist somewhere out there.
Awesome vid
The Intro was hilarious I never new seeing Mat pat run around in agony over the "blue" flavour would make me laugh so hard. Good job editing team :>
Matpat: My Diet Coke adiction thanks you sir!  Me: …  Me on the inside: XD hahahhahah
Me: My fav flavour of all time is blue rasberry  MatPat: Ruins the flavour for me  Me: YOUR JOKING ME! THE ONE THING U DIDNT RUIN FOR ME!!
blue raspberry = sour sweet raspberry Edit: that what i think
Blue
Percy Jackson’s rethinking his life choices with this one!

Thank you so much for this video. Been thinking about this for a year.😂
Blueberry
Licking Ariel??? lol before or after she loses the tail???👀
Blueberries are blue and nature and they’re not toxic or poisonous
Blue Raspberry actually is the flavour, Blueberry and Raspberry.
3:50  What if it used to be real in like, caveman times, but eventually stopped existing before anyone could document abt it?  Idk just a thought
My fav blue color this is horror video but this is funny at the same time 💙💙💙
You guys should do an episode on Red 40 and if it really causes hyperactivity
The flaming blue f*** cocktail tastes like burning, college, and hangover. 3:46
Blue raspberry More like bubble gum rip off.

GRAPE FANS RISE UP💯💯🔥‼️‼️
We will miss you MatPat.

Grape flavoure stuff doesn't taste like grapes is because you normally eat table grapes when grape flavoured stuff uses concord grapes
Percy Jackson fans?

I always thought it was raspberry dyed blue
Blue
0:40 matpat having a mental breakdown about blue
Ok but my question is: why not make Raspberries purple, and make Blueberries, you know, BLUE? Like Raspberries are literally a shade if red, that's way closer to purple than to blue of all things. And blueberries are literally BLUE, like if your blueberries are purple you should NOT be eating them
I'm gonna sleep to this
I hate grape flavored things but love grapes, its very disorienting
Intro MatPat saying blue is a fake color, (literally has blue in his snowcone like Dan) then proceeds to go crazy XDD

Blue raspberries might not exist, but purple ones does. Close enough right?
I doubt that you plan on doing an otter pops lore video but Santi, if you’re reading this, please make one. I’ve never even had an otter pop yet I’m intrigued.

“Blue #2 was just sitting at the Red-y”😂😂😂😂😂😂
What next, Santa's not real :(
Blue raspberry is the best cause it’s always the most sour

Percy Jackson entered the chat
Otter pop theory please (⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠)
Before I get too far in I always thought it was just raspberry flavored but they called it blue to separated from cherry or strawberry flavors
This is the Percy Jackson episode
Not gonna lie, I haven't had many cocktails/mixed drinks, Blue Hawaiians are pretty good
Honestly for me, the reason I would never eat anything blueberry flavored, is that I watched way too much Charlie and The Chocolate Factory.
Blue.
I never was a bluerasberry tipe of girl.i mostly liked strawberry, watermelon, grape and green apple/sour apple

Matpat the sour patch kids "pudding" cup is a jello cup, not pudding. It's also delicious.
I always wondered about blue raspberry flavor, but now I'm just like the head editor. You can't tell me glacier freeze gatorade isn't blue flavor, what's it supposed to be, the flavor of salt? Also, color in poison dart frogs has nothing to do with their toxicity, since they're only toxic if they eat a specific deadly plant they like.
Blu
Me who thought that Blue Raspberry meant raspberry flavor but with blue food dye: Wow, I was way off... (._.)
sugar, that's what it tastes like. Also the otters don't have personas, they have fursonas :P
3:54 blueberry 🫐
Sody Pop: Hello Dan from the game theorists   Dan: Hello Sody Pop from Chikn Nuggit  Dan and Sody: *Calls blue raspberry blue flavor*
Blue Raspberry is a flavour made from Whitebark Raspberries which are purple in colour just like brambles,  Some foods and drinks have what called Brilliant Blue FCF to add the blue colour. Although blue colour can be made naturally
The intro made me laugh
Seriously bro has a point they should've used blueberries
I dare you to do an audio Pop lol that would be some interesting Contant
Leave my Blue Rasberry alone!  Go rampage against something important like short shorts!  :D
me watching this video while eating strawberries 🤣🤣
Just wondering who actually thought blue raspberry was a legit fruit or that it tastes like raspberry, in the uk raspberry tastes usually like a creamy raspberry and is usually coloured pink and blue raspberry as some crazy delicious flavour the american made up
The flavor of blue is blueberry 3:33 :|
For me cool blue gatorade always tasted like oranges :|

I'm gonna be honest, the flavour IS blue. Blue is rubbery and slightly sour
blueberry rasberry🌚🌚🗿🗿

Idc I still love it
Why not use Isobutyl formate (which is described as having a raspberry aroma and is already used as artificial flavouring) as part of the flavouring mix?

But.... blue is my favorite color

Blue raspberry should be called blue punch since its blue and its fruit punch because its a fruit mix
Hm... blue flavor, respectable.
EVERONE SHOULD KNOW THIS!
Is no one going to notice that Matpat has a Pansexual flag as his snowcone? Like, don't get me wrong, I love it. I just flipping love it. Edit: I totally agree with Dan and Amy. Iz blue. Iz yummy.
It's just blueberry rasberry, at least with vapes
"Now we kno a what licking Ariel would taste like" brilliant speech and also editor Dan is....kinda creepy because when everyone else told us their colour and editor Dan said blue i....was..kinda..annoy ed because all Dan said was "blue"! BLUE ISN'T A FLAVOUR
I would love to see Matpat do a video on Red40
blue
Literally like everybody i know says that grape tastes like medicine but for the first time in forever somebody agrees.
Now I want to know what grape tastes like.
Matpat has really thinking about licking Ariel 💀💀💀
Roses are red violets are blue I hit da gritty then I go poo no one liked my comment so I decided to😮
Bro we all new it was fake already
when i have candies... its usually colored like this red strawberry pink rapsberry dark red cherry blue blueberry not sure why america has to go that weird route... you can have multiple shades of red in one packages...  we have candy packages withup to 5 different shades of red....
If I have artificial flavors I only taste disgust (legit)
Grape actually does taste like grapes, but the problem is that no one eats those grapes anymore, the grape flavored things are flavored with concord grapes, but we eat TABLE GRAPES.
Why is misleading consumers even legal in USA? and what color is blueberry flavored things?
I love the flavor "Yes"

It took me a while to figure out that blue raspberry flavored things are actually made by using whitebark raspberries.
I love grape!
Why do you do this to me ;(
Technically, blue is a flavor in the form of blueberry
I think blue raspberry is a cross between blueberry and raspberry
Blue Raspberry is just blueberry and raspberry mixed together isn't it?
me: eating a blue rasberry otterpop while he said otter pops....
slay dan
Me in The back raising my hand to answer what blue M&Ms taste like  Matt pat saying that one in the back put your hand down we know blue M&Ms taste like chocolate
4 words to solve why they use blue raspberry instead of blue berry: BLUE. BERRIES. ARE. PURPLE.

I searched this theory up in google AND IT SAID ITS NOT IN NATURE SO IT ACTUALLY DOESNT EXIST
THANK YOU! I've never liked or trusted blue food. I've rallied against blue raspberry  my entire life and always admonish my son when he drinks what I call "flavored windex"
Wait, people actually think that blue razberries exist? I thought it was a joke.
Blue
Finally know the real flavor!

So...does that mean people are confusing the fictional blue raspberry with blackberries?
It’s a blueberry and Coconut probably

Colors can absolutely be flavors. For example Code Red Mountain Dew is red flavor. That is what red tastes like. No I will not be taking any criticisms.

This episode BLUE me up (get it?)
I always thought licking Ariel would taste fishy ;D
Blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue is a favour
Mine
blue raspberry taste like medicine
Didn’t we already know it was fake though…? Like it’s a fun video and all but I knew blue raspberry wasn’t a thing a long time ago.
4:35 I saw a few comments about blueberries being purple, do you mean when it's turned into juice or when it's still a berry, and mermaid flavor is, at least, making some sense but saying blueberries are blue is not? Alright, also for some reason, companies don't use blueberries as flavor.
Isn't blue raspberry just raspberry but with blue coloring
No joke we he asked if anyone could tell him what the blue things actually tasted like I immediately pointed to the blue M&M and said chocolate right before he said “yes I know you in the back I know blue M&M’s taste like chocolate you can sit down” 😂🤣
Smurf cat
I’m ta3:25 in the video it is raspberry

Some of the food can be BLUEBERRY!!!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What about blueberry
Darius for bed and they needed one for blue so they couldn't use raspberry for red so they had to use raspberry for blue so they changed its colour the flavor of blue raspberries does raspberry
The captions are wrong. It’s spelled “blu”. Iz blu.
blue raspberry is blue flavor
Blue
OTTERPOP LOOOOOORE!!!!! DO IT!!!
They did not use blueberries because blueberries are purple
You just ruined everything “blue raspberry “ for me 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
this is the first time i have heard of "blue raspberry" im not lying💀
blue
I had always heard that blue raspberry was actually pear flavor, which is very noticeable with Jolly Rancher specifically. Still my go-to flavor for anything.
Actually blue raspberry is a thing I looked it up and I saw pictures of it or that's not raspberry
Concord grapes taste almost exactly like most artificial grape flavors, and I cannot be convinced otherwise.
Melvin De Groote is the original purple guy
DO NOT BUY THE SOURPATCH JELLO CUPS, THEY TASTE AWFUL. The ghost one is pretty good and the warheads one is top notch
This dude is talking about the flavor of grapes like he has never eaten one
Blue
Even Cirkul has blue raspberry (GoSip)
Pop not soda
Those are ice lollies not popsicles
Sweets not candy
Why do people like unbaturally blue food?? I have it! it reminds me of mold!
Blueberries and many other fruits (grapes, cherries, raspberries…) contain anthocyanin, a molecule that is a reddish colour in its naturally acidic environment: fruit. But, when it comes into contact with alkaline ingredients (the baking soda in a cake batter, for ex.), the anthocyanin turns blue.
Actually the reason the raspberry flavor is blue is because raspberries turn blue whenccooked with baking soda, just learn that this is a similar thing that happens to sunflower seeds.
Nu uh
Blue
Blue it’s just blue every thing is blue
Hey Matt pat a bit of your snow cone is blue just take a guess
Instead of Otters, what if they were Ferret Themed?
What about blackberries?
I can confirm that b l u e is the best flavor.
So I’m eating Jolly Ranchers right,
Mattpat proving he has the worst taste in things, artificial grape is one of the worst flavors and often the flavor of medicine, awful stuff
6:06 bruh! 😂!!
I want blue.
it’s simple, blue raspberry is raspberry painted blue.
blue
Did you know yellow raspberries exist
Can = Dan
"What flavour did you get Can?" "Blue
Me watching this I a completely blue room

What flavor is this me blueberry
Dan had too much fun saying Blue I bet
Yas I saw the romanian ice cream
Interesting 🤔
It’s been 4 months and matpat still hasn’t made a video about otter pops lore 😂
Otterpop lore theory pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Blue raspberries raspberries are red so they can catch on and say they called it blue raspberry but that’s a thing so we just say blue flavor by the way, that’s dark blue flavor I’m just joking😂 and Gatorade, so I guess you could say there’s multiple flavors of blue
0:47 blue is my favorite too 😂
Hey, Food Theory.  . . Now you MUST do a video on the Family Tree of Otter Pops.
I always liked raspberries and raspberry candy. Especially the hard candies that looked like raspberries, were the correct color of raspberries, and had a soft of raspberry 'goo'. All the 'blue' raspberry does is make your mouth look like you ate a Smurf.
Blue
Again I Say.. BLUE.
Please do an otter pop lore video I beg you
Honestly blue-rassberry was always my least favorite I prefer the yellow or reds ones 😋
Noob jk
Mat I'm pretty sure blue raspberry is just raspberry with blueberry (I think they shortened the name).
Matpat. Now you have to make a otter pop lore episode
“Blue Raspberry isn’t a thing Dan!!!”
blue.
I love the blue!
*i sure do love the taste of B L U E*

We should make the blue raspberry a real thing by modifying raspberries.

A-Treat blue raspberry soda is by far the best mixer drink. I drank heavily for years, i drank about a gallon of vodka a day and about 3 liters of A-Treat blue raspberry soda, it actually comes in 3 liters bottles at the gas station i passed on the way home from the liquor store. But been sober a decade well Nov 25th will be a decade. Life is good. I love the theorist channels. Matpat you should do a food theory live. I mean cross country at theatre's and casinos. Like the wind creek in bethlehem PA. I saw the Mythbusters live there. But I would one doudiciliion percent go if its within 800 miles (not including Canada). Have it so we the fans can bring our own theory or hacks. Have a truck filled with merchandise and set up stands to sell them from.
i never heard of blue raspberry i only know blueberry and raspberry
I love sour patch kids

"𝙍𝘼𝘼𝘼𝘼"😂😂😂
Did anyone else notice the pansexual flag in pats snow cone?
0:35 just say blue berry like this one 🫐
why didnt they chose bluebarry?
I always thought that blue raspberry was a combination of raspberry and blueberry since blueberries don't actually have that much taste on their own, or that it was just raspberry but dyed blue because raspberry could be confused with the other dozen ''red'' flavours.
blueberrys are purple
otter pop lore pls
When Dan said blue I felt that
FORGET FNAF WEEK ON THE CHANNELS DO OTTER POPS
BLUEBERRIES ARE PURPLE
isn't it just lemonade flavor?
Blue rasbery prime is the bestselling flavor of prime
I too find the color blue frustrating
This is kinda embarrassing but until now I just assumed blue raspberries were real and had a shade of blue similar to blueberries.
Blue
blue flavour is gum flavour wdym razzberry

So guys, minor issue, but matpats snowcone has three flavors, one of them being BLUE. lol 😂

I know people that believe Blue Raspberries exist, told them to prove it, and they showed me a blackberry 🤦 Rural area's are interesting to grow up in.
In my family we say that the flavour is blueberry and in the most families I know so I was really surprised wen mattpat talked about blue raspberry flavour. Wen I first heard it in this video I was like what no that can’t be a real flavour because blue candy is the flavour of blueberry’s
Matt. I love you man but the flavor of blue is      Blue

Blue
I’m over here in the back like I like food theory’s choice
If you let the raspberries ripen for a little extra time. They turn a dark reddish purple.
Blueberries are not actually blue, they're purple
This whole video i couldn't stop thinking about "They gave me no blue raspberry dawg"
Yeah, where I live the blue gatorade isnt ''cool blue'' , but it says its rasberry flavored.
Yeah licking Ariel would taste salty, alright. Like the ocean
Blue Rasberry is real
Don’t hate me for this, but I actually prefer grape than other flavors
I agree with everything you say
I thought blue raspberries were a real thing-
B L U E
Me who would gobble up anything with blue raspberry: IDC IF THE FLAVOR IS A LIE😭🩵
here in Europe blue drinks and fruit candy are usually tropical fruit while blue ice cream, is bubblegum flavor
blue = blueberry
Blue
On the subject of people tasting what they expect to taste, for over 30 years I thought that the blue and pink frosted animal crackers were vanilla and strawberry flavored.
12:25 I don’t care! Still yummy 😋
I would watch an otter pop lord video
4:54 because it’s delicious 😋
Wish I figured that out after this came out
Blue raspberry must be just like a blue berry with citric acid
Id lay money to see an otter pop lore video

Blue is delicious!
IM SMART YOU NOW

If blue beat the fan vote how is there a purple Eminem
I'm just gonna say that if anyone tells you that food, game, film, or style theory are useless let me tell you I have used videos from every channel for essays for school and got an A for every one of those essays, so no these channels are not useless. And yes I made an essay about blue raspberries for English it was a choose-your-own topic for extra credit.
blue is old spice
Blue raspberry is not a raspberry!
PURPLE GUY
I legitimately just thought it was to differentiate it from strawberry, the definitive red sweet fruit
So we're just skipping over the fact that most artificial raspberry flavors are castoreum which is beaver @ss? 🦫  I expected more of you, Matthew Patthew.
me; I got conusismt red
It is a flavor😒 the best flavor
Hearing dan saying blue, is just so blue
Why is it a lie
7:02 please do an otter pop lore episode
BLUEBERY IT IS THAT EASY
Im still waiting for the otter pop lore video
You should do a video about color changing tea like butterfly pea flower tea which is originally blue but turns pink with citrus juice. There are others that change color, too. Now there is purple tea, too. There are many colors in tea now and would make a pretty video.
Man’s getting so bored he’s literally just going crazy over a dang flavor
Does anyone know why Haribo gold bears strawberry flavor is green?
I can confirm as a addict to everything flavoured blue raspberry blue raspberry is now, Blue Rizzberry
Banana candy flavor is a extinct plantain
Its accually cause they ran out of red dye so put blue instead.
Blu
Any other xennials remember when blue M&Ms replaced the tan ones?
I love how everything about this is completely lowbrow yet genuinely entertaining.
Blue raspberry is my favorite flavor so to people like me this video was a little bit weird
this reminds me of raquelle's "pink isnt a flavor" 😭
The flavor is raspberries Mixed with blue berries Stupido
Nooooooo I love blue raspberry fak you mat
I really want a otter pops theory
We found out how to take MatPat's sanity away from him.
*B L U E*

How about the banana laffy taffy theory next?

Blueberry and raspberry
In the words of Randy Feltface ahem.... "BLUEBERRIES ARE F$&@ING PURPLE!!!" Lmao
Mate that is a blue ringed octipus that is in Australia I think that gives enough infomation
BLUE
3:41 it’s like a sour sweet blueberry mixed with a tint of real raspberry, Blue raspberry is kind of just appealing, for the name—if you think about it, blueberry is kind of just. Erm.. boring, and old. And blue raspberry rolls of the tounge- so it could be markiting help. Plus, red and blue is a duo known by almost everyone.
"Licking aerial"
and mattpatt got pansexual flavor i’m not kidding the colors of his snow cone is the pan flag
I always just assumed that blue raspberry was a flavor mix of raspberry and blueberry
Blue blue
I am a grape guy to
Reminds me of Gura when she's advertising her new bag...  "Bag"
If you refer to the flavor of squeeze popsicles from childhood as ANYTHING other than “blue” you’re just not correct.
Blueberry is mine not blue raspberry...remove the rasp!! Keep berry only!!!
As a felt fact comedian one said: "BLUEBERRIES ARE PURPLE"
According to the back of blue raspberry minute maid bottle.... it's just raspberry and pear mixed
4:32 matpat no, MATPAT NO
Cherenkov radiation also appears as very lovely shades of blue. 💙
BLUE RASPBERRY IS LOVED BY ALL BUT IT’S SO BAD FOR YOU
Blue
I cant stand blue raspberry and always knew it was the most artificial of flavors
My favourite animal is poison dart frogs I know they are poisonous
Otter pop  theory
The blue joke in the beginning makes me nostalgic-
Maybe it’s a cultural thing, or I’ve been living under a piece of rock candy, but I’ve literally never heard of blue raspberry in my life until this video.
the beginning of this episode, naming blue foods, is smth straight outta the riordanverse
you need to do a theory on blackberry, its popular in other countries replacing grape usually
Walter is gonna make some money on this new "blue" that he already knows how to make it
The fayvir is blue Berry
This will not stop it being my favorite flavor
Also, Monsters logo is LITERALLY 666 IN HEBREW
blue berries are purple 4:03
Fun fact: our brains get positive vibes from the color blue so that’s another reason why it’s so popular! 0:00
can they keep red no.2 away cause I'm allergic to it and it's quite annoying especially when my favorite flavors contain it (other than blue razz cause I literally love it)
Wait style theory isn't blue!!!
Otterpop lore video please
also, the flavor might be blackberries instead of raspberries maybe?
if you haven't made a grimace shake theory You should do it! (NOTE: also include the blueberry shortage (It's a real thing by the way!)
Wait blue raspberry don't exist??? I swear I remember them😅😅😅
Narration is OBNOXIOUS.
I want the green one fake green raspberry i don't care if it's fake the color is the good one
What flavor you got me:food flavor.the others👀
where is the otter pop lore?
ambatakaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam
Why did no one talk about blue raspberry prime?
Spaghetti on trees. Chocolate cows. We should have learned by now.
how much times did he say blue
5:19
New Nilered video idea: making blue raspberry flavour from asbestos.
Please do banana flavor
Aight the trick to opening an ottwr pop woth your teeth is to only rip open the edge peices then roll the rip across the whole top. Same way as i chew my fingernails.
I looked this up before, so I can tell you its because they already had other flavours in basically all their red dyes, so when they wanted to do raspberry, they used one of the colours they still hadnt used much of, which is blue.
Ah, yes, “Blue.” My favorite flavor!
I pity the souls that actually thought blue raspberry was a fruit r
Blue👍
Yesterday I bit into a raspberry and it tasted JUST LIKE a blue raspberry
im a rasberry guy on sour patch kids
Wth he got beef with a flavor..
Blue Raspberry Jolly Ranchers taste like crisp pear to me.
1:10
I was reading the comments and now I’m wondering why candy only tries to mimic the flavor of fruit and not anything else. I know that having a steak flavored gummy bear would be really weird but like what’s the origin of it? Y’know?
Mat: "Blue is actually a very rare color in nature" Some of my reasoning for not liking the color blue whatsoever: Adios
I mean, yeah, raspberries are fucking red.
100% we need to explore otter pop lore
Blue taste like sugar…
Blue
I said blueberry
Ya like astronomy huh what about blue giants? Huh huh

You are wrong😂
matt being annoyed over a blue rasberry flavor for 5 minutes

Blue raspberry is just blue berry’s and raspberry’s right?
Im going to be honest.. an otter pop lore theory would be GREAT.
B L U E
Blue flavour is blueberry not blue raspberry
What the…
Always felt blue rasberry tasted more like grape and cherry mix.
I thought blue butterflies were of the 'just light refracting ' type, not pigment
Blue
Well, I can tell you I’m blue blue raspberry or blue really just taste usually it taste sweet or sour usually a combination of both that’s what it taste like because I take them I have a squishy‘s and usually it taste really sweet after work. I hit a sourness that’s what blue taste like like that’s what the fictional blue raspberry taste like.
Yeet the blue poison DART frog into an Balon to "pop" it for NOW APARENT REASON!

Dragon fruit  vitamins flute dragon fruit
Blue raspberry was invented because they wanted a raspberry flavor but didn’t want to make more red flavors
I thought it was raspberry and blueberry
as a gatorade drinker cool blue tastes like oranges
Fun fact: blue raspberry is man made fruit
Why do you come up with the stuff? I also love blue raspberry though I’m also I am a blue raspberry fan I have a blue raspberry prime.
I don’t know what your life is… But, I am now hooked on otter pop lore! Plz follow on that! 🙏🥺

0:06 ice cream look like chad gigachad
I always knew that blue raspberry was a synthetic flavor via just a quick Google search. It has this tart and sour taste of raspberry candy, my favorite being the Jolly Ranchers.
Mat pat: FLAVOR DID U GET DAN.       Dan: Bluueeee Mat pat: screaming in anger and misery
thanks MatPat, I am now very very blue da ba de da ba D.I.E
2:35 correction: that was not because of m&ms but because a demigod son of Poseidon won the war against Kronos and had to signal to his mother.
the grape flavour is from concord grapes btw
the intro reminded me of one of chikn nuggit's videos
4:32 best out of context matpat yet lol

mat-pat i love you but blue=blueberry
Apple solos ALL
0:10 bro got that romania ice cream cone
Blue
Lemon, or yellow, is always my fav. Usually citursey. I love that citurs bite!
Are blue raspberries real? Bright blue raspberries do not exist in nature—but some are almost blue.
Very butifull
Ok but blue is the best color of course
One word: windex
I'm still bemused by the idea that "blueberries" are being considered blue here. They're clearly purple.  Also, "grape flavour" doesn't taste like your typical grapes, but it does taste like concord grapes, which are in fact purple.
glacier freeze gatorade tastes like coconut
BLUEBERRIES ARE PURPLE THERE IS NOT BLUE FRUIT!!!!!!!!
A
Bruh it took you half a video to explain what your gonna do

In school i lernt about the posson dart frog but not the blue one.
GIVE US THE OTTER POP LORE
Every Percy Jackson fan watching this video: 😯😦 (For people who don’t get it, Percy’s mom [Sally] works at a candy store, and Percy’s stepdad [Gabe] in the first book/movie [The Lightning Thief] always said that “blue food doesn’t exist!” And ever since then, Percy and Sally have always been eating blue food, especially blue candies from the candy store.)
i thought i was the only grape flavor enjoyer
Amaranth? The stuff I cook with all the time in Zelda??
Never heard of it
Describe that flavor in any other way apart from BLUE , just describe blue as a flavor
But that’s why it’s amazing. Because it’s not real
WHY DID NO ONE TELL MEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
blue
Blue raspberry is a manufactured flavoring and food coloring for candy, snack foods, syrups, and soft drinks.[1][2] The flavor and color do not derive from any species of raspberry.[1][2] According to Jerry Bowman, executive director of the Flavor & Extract Manufacturers Association of the United States as of 2016, the flavor profile of raspberry was developed using "mostly esters of the banana, cherry, and pineapple variety."[2] Sugar is commonly used to create taste appeal for the blue raspberry flavoring.[2]
its italian ice....
blue raspberry are actually hybrids of rubus strigoSUS and rubus occidentalis  it is a local name used in prince edward but still they are still not real
Matpat! I love grape flavor
What Evan makes raspberry blue?🤷
I still like the blue though😢
Who is not the blue ones we’re just like blue berry that’s what I would always say to my parents when we try the blue ones they were so good
i saw this video while eating a blue jolly rancher, and my mouth got a little confused and i was desperately trying to figure out what it tasted like
I keep forgetting both Styles theory exist and how bad of a name it is.  They need to go for a Rebrand. Fashion theory so much better
Otter Pops food theory petition
Now I’m hungry in the middle of the night,thanks matpat >:(
-7:40-- why couldn’t raspberry be maroon instead?- oh
wait people go for blue things? personally i go for anything red i associate red with tasty food and i'm not even the only one i know a few people who think the exact same way
I baked you a pie! Oh boy, what flavor?! BLUE FLAVOR
i feel like artificial grape flavor is purple flavor
Who here thinks grape soda and/or root beer tastes like medicine?
The amount of times dan said blue is too much
I love how Matt acts like we are in a class rn.
Just because it's not real fruit doesn't mean that it's not a good flavour!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡😡😡😡😡👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
American Purple being grape flavour is heartbreaking, you guys are missing out on the superior purple flavouring, which is of course Blackcurrant
Flavor: sour raspberry
What flavor did u get blue flaver blue isnt a flaver i got BLUE FLAVOR
Burger.
‏أي والله انه أنا أصلا ما اشوف انه هي صدقية I don’t see it that it is real

this didnt help me at all i already knew it wasnt a real thing and just a flavor...
Please do an otter pop lore video!!!
True
Was eating flavor blue snowcone
My favorite Gatorade Zero is actually the weirdly nondescript "Berry" flavor. I couldn't tell you what kind, to be honest. But it certainly does taste like "berry." 😅
As someone currently drinking cool blue, it taste like to much sugar.
I don't get the point of this video. I think I can speak for everyone here: we knew raspberries aren't blue but red. We kind of assumed there was food coloring involved. And it is also common knowledge that candies and sodas don't really contain the actual fruit but artificial flavours. Is it a "lie"? Sure. But if everyone knows it's a lie it kind of spoils the shocking reveal of that lie.  Thanks though for the story about why they changed from red to blue in the U.S. I didn't know that. When I was visiting the U.S. I was at a Chicago food festival and they had an ice cream stand there selling yellow (Mango), red (strawberry) and blue (raspberry) ice cream and I thought that they just made the raspberry blue so that they didn't have two red ones. Now I know the solution of that puzzle after 15 years!
Flavor of Blue is blue from blues clues
0:25 Dan being op for a few seconds
How about blueberry
MatPat: what flavour is blue? Me: blueberry
Wait what about the flavor blue rebbel
This is my favorite fruit by the way
I DON'T WANT TO DIEEEEE
WHYYYYYYYYY IS THE WORLD SO BADDDD WHYYYY I WISH I WASN'T BORN 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

I finally understand why sody pop from chikn nuggit says blue flavour
Is it blackberries?
What about Blueberry
Rest in peace red raspberry
You actually true no blue raspberries real
blue
Blue
As someone who has never eaten a blueberry or raspberry, I still have no idea what it tastes like besides being sweet
Can't believe you mentioned r. Leucodermis and not Rubus Cæssium, the only actual blue raspberry. It's times like these I'm glad to be a rubus nerd
ok, I understand MatPat when he's talking about otter pops with no scissors, but i never got a margarita flavor, and I get them because they're better then most normal popsicles. Seriously, margarita?
Blue
The Grape Flavor in every candy is Amazing!!! You can't convince me its not.
cant wait for 50 years later peeps be saying this cyan taste so good
Why isn't the actual blueberry a more commonplace flavour in the first place anyway?  And also, I had always thought that the blue raspberry flavour is what you would get if you were to mix blueberry, blackberry & raspberry into its own hybrid fruit.
o h  n o
As a wise man once yelled, “Blueberries are freaking purple!”
It's blueberry
This is so dumb obviously they just ran out of colors since half the flavors are red raspberry isn’t always blue but they made it blue so it easy to identify stop believing this and do a literal 2 second Google search instead of wasting 13 minutes on this crap
Blueberry’s are an exception to the rule
I always thought blue raspberry was a mix of blueberry and raspberry
Please do an otterpop lore video
In Europe, blue raspberry doesn't exist, if we have raspberry candies they're just pink lol
Lil' Orphan Orange is my favorite flavor of Otter Pop.
Well i tasted  cool blue Gatorade
Still the greatest taste
If a gentiticest watches this and makes an actual blue raspberry just to mess with Matpat I would and wouldn't be surprised.
LMAOO as he was asking about blue my first thought was the m&m comment
My favorite flavor, blue!
do an otter pop lore
3:12 its just sweeter water its horrible
that intro was good
Dan: blueeeeee Mat: dying in the background
As a person who lives in Europe (Poland) I didnt even know that something like the idea of a blue raspberry existed till I was like 14. We dont have anything in shops that would hold the title of being blue rasberry flavoured (besides the products imported from America).
Blueberries are purple
blue
There is lore in plants versus zombies.
This so called blue raspberry is actually name Rubus Leucodermis.
Probably why im fine with grapes and cherries but i hate things that are "flavoured" like grapes or cherries
Idk man I think that red and pink flavors are better
Best flavor of air heads and why is it blue
Thanx. Now i need to go from store to store until i find my favorite Hubba Bubba BLUE RASPBERRY gum!!!!!! It's soooo good!!!
MatPat sounds like he's about to have an aneurysm throughout, and I'm here for it.
but to me blue raspberry flavor just tastes... blue... same with some grape flavors just taste purple... some flavors just taste like the color the candy is and its so weird
Why am I sad that when Dan said blue matpat didn't say di bu de di bu die?
The blue color is blueberries
When I tried cool blue Gatorade for the first time it was like a orange kind of taste more than orange gatorade
This flavor always tasted like soap for me Idk if im talking aboutbthe same one as you
4:00 MatPat says blueberries are blue, but they're actually purple. Purple isn't a real color. Does that mean we can't see a blueberry's true colors? 🤔
OMG... Lol.  Cherry for tart,  Potassium. Juice. Citrus.   Lol. Wow.
Wait, if blue raspberry came about because people were scared of red dye why didn’t it affect the more popular fruit flavors like strawberry and cherry?  The two theories seem to contradict each other, like one is saying raspberry was relegated to blue because it was "picked last" while the other theory is saying raspberry had to be changed because it was the focal point for the panic about red dye (wouldn't the focal point have been the other, more popular flavors)?
Blue
a lot a food prepping stuff is made in the colour, supposedly, bit breaks open or something it can be easily identified in the finished product, as be blue in colour? as something not meant to be there?
nah yall goofy green was always the better one
I love the cones
We got prime boys we got prime
In my opinion, the best snow cone flavor is cherry and root beer mix.
Blue is the rarest to occur in nature: The Ocean: 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
Can you please do episodes on grape and banana and fruit punch flavors
It’s blueberry it just sounds more appetising
My whole life is a lie😭 I was always told that it was a blueberry raspberry mix

My favorite has to be orange. It has a sour taste, but the amount of sourness lines up perfectly with whatever it is.
cool blue is very not good. glacier freeze is where it’s at
@4:53…. We are ‘diving into’… I am a fan matpat but start the darn video already! I took 5 minutes. I understand setting things up but it’s getting to be a bit much.
when he said blue I am surprised that matpat didn't say da bu de da bu die
I never even heard anything about blue rasberry😂😂😂😅😅
The intro for this video was 10/10
Blue...
Blue raspberry flavor is good… but I’ve always thought it was overrated. Grape’s better  But I have wondered what they really are for a while.
Uhh... Guys... Can someone tell me what bubblegum is supposed to taste like..?

Bro froght bluebreey
Speaking as someone who's never seen The Matrix... shouldn't the red pill / blue pill reference be the other way around? 😅 I know he made the "blue pill" joke because he was exposing *blue* raspberry, but isn't the red pill the one that like. wakes you up so you can see what's really out there?
Personally- I like orange 🍊 😎 😋 😏 👌 😌

Wait this is fake fruit?
Blue is a flavor
The flavor most ve called fruit parfait.
I thought blue raspberry’s are a thing XD
Before watching this: grape and strawberry mixed together tastes like blue raspberry
I enjoy watching these videos. I watch them all the time now. I’m not really much to watch YouTube videos but I watch them on fan rewards to earn points.
Everyone knows blue is the flavour of chemicals and marketing
He said licking Ariel like it’s a bad thing
Honestly why not just use blueberries
But I thought it has banana, cherry and pineapple flavors
I seen a real blue raspberry before. I think someone dyed it blue

dragon flavor would be dragon fruit flavor.
This was very informative but why does this man speak like that 💀
matpat: what flavor is that dan: blue matpat:thats not a flavor dan: is blue
The intro to this video is maybe the first time I’ve ever actually cringed in my life, terrible writing, Reddit tier, belongs back in matpat’s high school theater
what about the "The Rubus leucodermis "
Blue
Blue🗿
*yes a INDIGO named toxic chemical contained in a BLUE pigment* 💀

As much as I love raspberries, I’ve never been a “blue raspberry” fan. Or a fan of blue food or drinks in general. It always seems inedible & vaguely poisonous to me, lol.
I have legitimately never heard of blue raspberry until now. Is it one of those things that’s only in America?
An interesting exception to the widespread rule that blue things in nature are poisonous/toxic are blue lobsters. It seems like they should be protected by toxins of some sort, but their colouring actually just makes them more susceptible to predators.

blue
Ooo otter pops lore sounds nice
Mention blue Lagoon from Chili’s!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I, personally, would love to see a theory on Otter Pop lore
The grape flavor thing is imitating a flavor found in Concord grapes. It’s not exact or 1-1 but it’s not wrong
I figured this out way before this video came out lol.
I like blue colour Those who like blue colour 👇🏻                         👇🏻
Blue raspberry is a real native raspberry from the rubus family and its Name is rubus leucodermis, check on google loser and next time tell real the Logic or when YouTube find out your gonna you smacked in the face!!
blue flavor should be blueberry it is blue  and a berry  named blueberry

9:30 I know this is a nitpick but it makes me mad to unreasonable degree, Edison was not an inventor, he was a businessman, he employed inventors to work for him, calling Edison an inventor is like calling Elon Musk or Steves Jobs an inventory, they are not, their job is to tell pay people to do actually job for them

Blue is not going to be earths favorite  color I will make blue extinct, especially light blue well at least         matpat  bullied  sonic.
3:24 Blueberry + raspberry It’s actually possible

Blue raspberry’s do exist, aka the whitebark raspberry just coloured slightly blue, that’s as close as you can get it,

It's blueberry
This theory is pretty good and I can’t wait for more videos like it
"what flavour did u get?"
You should have a podcast
Blue
Im going to be the one to say it since i dont see it. If none of yall are going to meme and take it seriously  im going to be the one that dose it. IM GUNNA SAY THE WORD  " BLUE BARRYS ARE FUCK'N PURPLE "-- randy falt face.
If you don't like the way blue tastes you can always try red instead.  It's a totally different flavor.  It definitely tastes less blue and more like the way red is supposed to.
hahahaha reminds me of the ninjago movie.....what's my power?......greeeeeeeeeeeeennnn
WHAT😡🤬😠😡🤬😠😡🤬😠😡🤬😠😡🤬😠
Came here from film theory
Blue is a flavor and you're wrong if you disagree with me 😆

Fun fact in the 1600-1700's people actually believed that tomatoes were poisonous.
Why is this so popular? My answer: cuz it's good
Blue raspberry was my favorite now Then watching this Me feel curious
It's not that complicated, Blue is just on the spectrum of sour.

Blueberry: 🙄
Matpat having a mental breakdown over being told the flavor is blue, is so.. real.
Blueberries are purple matpat. Search it up. THEY ARE PURPLE!!!!! DON'T TEST ME. LOOK IT UP!!!!!!!
grape flavored things are actually supposed to taste like concord grapes, not the green and purple ones you can get at meijers
i have never met one person that favours grape over blue raspberry (other than myself)
The otterpops part about not having scissors is so relatable
please do a otter pop theory
I ate a blue raspberry Icee while watching this and now I can taste the banana flavor in the background 😑 thanks MatPat.
My eyes are blue does that mean they’re fake?
im pretty sure the flavor is rasberry  and the thing is blue and thats why its blue rasberry
I always thought Blue Raspberry just meant Blackberry+Raspberry flavor
I’ve always called everything that looks blue and has a taste… blue flavor.
As a swedish person i always got confused since there is a berry commonly found on Gotland called ”Salmbär” or commonly refered to ”blåhallon” which means blue raspberry altough it is not that blue but more bluish purple
I’m eating  blue rasberry sour patch kids gummy
why is this such a big shocker to people
0:00 😂
OMG IM A GRAPE PERSON AS WELL!
Unpopular opinion, but I do not like blue raspberry... It tastes so fake to me! Like I can clearly tell it isn't raspberry! It's so unique and odd that my taste buds don't consider it an actual edible flavor!
my theory is its a raspberry that tastes blue
Blue. It’s blue flavor.

Wrong, my guy. There IS a species of grape that tastes EXACTLY like grape candy and is slightly more sour and gooey than other species of grape you see in stores. They are delicious but very rare. My dad has one of these grape bushes in his garden. They are great for making wine too.

Are you telling me that my favorite  flavour is not real
Can we get a plant scientist to breed  and grow a blue raspberry just to spite matpat
It's blueberry crying out loud😏
😅 I tried not true 😅
I love blue flavored snowcones
I mean the packaging does say “Artificially Flavored,” so they technically aren’t lying.
4:31 Ayo 🤨
Food theories keep me grounded in reality. I thought this was released yesterday 💀
It’s not a real fruit, blue raspberry isn’t a real fruit this isn’t even a theory it’s just fact
0:23 bro you have some blue in your snow cone
Artificial flavors are a lie.
2:17 Oh hey, Undertale was right, blue does mean stop
theres blue ice cream called mermaid sparkle .... i was hoping it would taste like blue moon icecream but it tastes like blue cotton candy
Please do otter pop lore 🙏🙏
I genuinely hate raspberries, blue or otherwise
Banana artificial flavoring: **walks away**
I've always said grape flavoring is purple flavor and I will stand by it😅
For anybody wondering about grapes, they are actually still grapes not artificial (though it includes many artificial flavorings alongside it) grape flavor is just concord grapes which are grown in larger amounts and ripen quicker, alongside them being able to seperate from the pulp faster. there is a chemical in concord grapes known as Methyl anthranilate which is where they get the flavoring for grapes. though honestly i prefer green grapes.
Blue Axolotl flavord
Everything is artificial flavored because if it was not artificial it would taste tart and not taste good
What if it blueberry flavor and you say the flavor is blue thinking its rasberry
So blue raspberry is made by god
Even though it's made from someone it's still made from God
They could’ve done yellow raspberry though cuz they exist, my step-dad grew them in the allotment

Dude blue raspberry was a whole different flavor than red raspberry and it has a more sour flavor
I'm so glad you made this because I had a full on debate with my coworkers about this, and we needed an answer desperately XD
Gummy worms blue flavor is grape
Strawberry candy and soda doesn't taste like strawberries either. You should mix that in with the grape episode
Tbh when you ask what flavor is blue, my first thought was orange 😂 Blue curaçao is a liqueur that tastes basically like triple sec, which is really sweet orange flavored.
I mean BlackBerries can be blue
There is a chance of them starting to genetically mutate rasberries to make them blue
From my tongue, I can tell that blue raspberry is a mix of raspberry, blueberry, a hint of pineapple, Hence the slight sourness, and maybe a tiny bit of blackberry  It’s just a mix of a bunch of different fruits, and to be honest I’m very disappointed in whoever made that flavor   Just do a different blue fruit, blue raspberry isn’t even a fruit do an actual fruit  Be honest
I loved the intro sequence
As frustrating as the concept of blue raspberry has always been to me. I've always found the ambiguity  of " bubblegum flavour " the most confusing... bubblegum can taste like anything... it's gum...am I tasting the bubbles??? 🤔
well at least blueberry exists
I will need that Otterpop lore video thank you
0:48
Reminds of Natutal Habitat Shorts.   "Mouth."
My Alexa is Indigo and I have touched it.....
One of my friends once went to an arcade type place with a bunch of their friends from choir and got an ice cream cone that, according to them, tasted like the color blue. Not blue raspberry, but the color blue, and they could not explain it past that, and all the other choir kids there tasted it and they all agreed it tasted like blue, and to this day I have no idea if that was all because the ice cream was weird or because choir kids are weird.
Ther is a reason im  glad that it’s blue rasbarea I’m alerjik to blue Varys😡
Blue🫥
I always just thought it was raspberry flavour, but blue pigment used to not confuse it with strawberry.
Now I'm carving blue raspberry SOMETHING. Its still a good flavor, even if it isn't real. Love your vids matpat!!
An otter pop lore video would be awesome lol
What about the companie that have blue and red rasberry?
What flavor is blue raspberry *yummy deliciousness and heaven*. Duh
Bulberi
I AM DE GROOTE!
My whole life, I thought it was blueberries and raspberries.
Honestly, this was extremely fascinating. I think you should do another video on the history of artificial strawberry flavor in candies and such. No matter how many years they've been trying, it just feels like companies have never been able to get it to taste right.
What the h*ck is blue raspberry
mat, you're making me feel bad for having blue rasberry be my favorite :(
Funniest intro ever!
What’s funny is that I was eating from a blue bowl while watching this
MATPAT please. I want an otterpops lore video
Who doesn't call it by the colors Jesus chirst you absolutely fucking 🤓
My favorite flavor is red! (Red being cherry, watermelon, straw berry raspberry and other red fruits)
This is the most unhinged Ive seen MatPat in a long time
4:32 WOAH HOLD ON A SECOND
honestly if they take radishes and call it strabery people will belive it
Day 180 of asking mat to explain the lore behind the game granny
matpat we wouldn't mind if you did have a break you do have a life after all your vidio's are anazing and we all can agree on that . and take a break iff you want
Before I saw this video I got the fnaf movie trailer
I bet MatPat has a world-class therapist MatPat says "Everywhere I look I see FNAF" and sobs  therapist "don't worry Scott Cawthon can't hurt you anymore he only has the power you give him" MatPat turn his back  "I don't know he's kinda demonic have you even played his latest torture devices Hurph uhh video games" therapist slowly transforming into Scott Cawthon's true form Lucifer slowly sounding more demonic as FNAF music plays seemingly out of nowhere " You mean my MASTER PIECES MATTY BROKEN PATTY!!!!!?"  Scott yells MatPat never saw the morning light again after that.
I love blue raspberry it  My favorite.
If blue isn't a flavor, how did you get the blue colorbin yours.
8:23 you said that wrong its amouranth the streamer
Blue ice cream has different names. Where I live it's called Smurf or sky blue. Sometimes it's called tutti-frutti.  But I think other things have blueberry  flavour. But I don't know. I thought the blue ice cream tasted like bubblegum.
How ignorant guys.. Blue Raspberries.. Or Dewberries/Salm/Salmonberries. Are a real fruit.. But they only grow in very odd places in Northern Europe, Scotland and Scandinavia. Around the baltic Sea in limey soil. It is an endangered species.. There is a high chance that maybe they actually read about blue fruit in an encyclopedia when they were deciding what artificial colour goes with which artificial flavour" and came across the blue raspberries in it. So many other favourite fruits were already red.. ANd only a handful are blue.
Artificial grape flavor (methyl anthranilate) actually does taste like ripe concord grapes. They just aren't as popular as the table grape varieties that we get year round.
blue raspberry is still my favorite
Imma have to agree with Dan on this one  Is, indeed, blue
the flavor is blue thats what
I just found this and watched it because I eat Kona ice
bluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue
You're a probably taste like blueberry
I always assumed blue raspberry was a way to label the sweet and sour taste idk, but thats what I associate it with at least
So was that otter pop lore ever theorized?

"BLUE BERRY IS FUCKING PURPLE" - Randy Feltface
Blue.
I always thought blue rasberry was just rasberry flavor but a bit more sour
I mean nowadays there are products that are actually Raspberry colored and have actual raspberry flavor so yeah I really like raspberry especially in Ice Tea.
When you’re pointing out natural blue pigments in the beginning of the video, one of the examples you used was the Blue Morpho Butterfly. Their blue color isn’t actually from a pigment, but rather from the microscopic patterns formed by their scales which causes only blue light to be reflected! Blew my mind when I first learned that🤯
Fun fact: in my country they actually use blue  berry picture for advertising blue products opposite of usa
Good is good yes
BLUE BERRY raspberry
I am De Groote
I know a number of people who LOVE blue raspberry. Personally, I hate it! I would rather have pineapple or peach or even actual raspberries than anything called blue raspberry.
Why is it so sweet though
The fact that you have to explain.. What was it. Whitebark raspberries(? "dark raspberries") sounds so weird. They grow on so many corners here right next to a street corner or a and you get stuff with it everywhere. Tho we call it "Brombeere"
Blue berry's are not blue either. They are purple on the outside, green on the inside, and they turn red when you smash them up. All food is a lie
IM WITH HEAD EDITOR DAN!!! BLUE!!!!!!!!
Cool blue tastes like artificial orange. Fight me
Artificial flavor, artificial coloring, artificial sweeting, artificial intelligence are all poison in their own way!
I would love to watch a video on otter pop lore. Somebody make it happen!
Blue is my favorite color. Nice video.
BLUE.
If there is cherry i go for that. And if there is Orange i want to keep away from it, but it's always so abundant. That's probably why the Orange Ottorpop is an orphan. NOONE WANTS THEM!
I always thought blue raspberry was just the mix of blueberry and raspberry. Taking blue and rass and shove in front of berry

Mmm yes... Personas... Totally :)
Anything with blue raspberry flavor immediately gives me headaches, so I avoid it. Aquamarine blue is one of my favorite colors, but if the product says blue raspberry, I PASS.
I think Dan is my soulmate
If orange can be a flavor I say so can blue
Man this video might have a point
Hey matt, I have a blue raspberry bush in my backyard. It’s a thing! But in reality they are more purple-ish. Some come pretty close tho! I’ll make sure to take a picture of the harvest this year! They don’t get quite the blackish tint of the ones you showed. Again, more purple.
When your favorite flavor of lollypop is blue raspberry: 😦🤯
I am groote
I said blueberry
Otter Pop lore please 🙏
It's simple. You mix blueberries with raspberries.🎉   🟦🍓+Rasp🍓=🟦Rasp🍓. Well what about the taste... Well it tastes like blueberries and Raspberries together, Obviously. Love you theorist.🐱👍💚
Yooo the rant on blue raspberry had me cryyyying 😂😂😂😂
me selectively breeding raspberries for 50 years to prove matpat wrong:
Matpat got the pansexual flavor 🤣💀(no hate)
Blue is literally my favorite flavor
There actually is a grape that taste like grape flavoring they’re very tiny and have seeds but still grapes
Idk why but in 7:48 u was looking at the sink the hole time
my life is a lie...                                                                                                    AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
An argument in defense of Grape flavored things the Grape flavoring replicates Concord Grapes which taste very different from the grapes commonly found in supermarkets, so it's not that they don't actually taste like grapes they just taste like a grape very few people have actually eaten.
0:51 lol
i always thought blue raspberry was blue berry and raspberry mixed together
It tastes kinda of tangy and  like chemicals.
I've known most candies have artifeshal  flaver  as well as curten food products since I was twelve I read the back of that packages.
Who doesn’t know that
blue is best flavor
Blueberries aren't actually blue they're green inside.
Otter pop: you can take the solid frozen ones and break them in half to open them!!!!
Try Concord grapes if you're looking to find what "grape flavor" tastes like.  I was floored when I made our first batch of jelly from them.
Maybe a random person saw the whitebark raspberry and thought its blue
i’ve never liked blue rasberry 😢
normally blue is bubblegum
he said "blue" exactly 56 times   note: if I miss counted, please correct me
And no, blueberry is purple.
OTTER 🦦 POP LORE! *BANGS ON THE TABLE* GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT!

blue raspberry was invented in 1984 and was a blue berry and raspberry flavoured candy and they didnt like the name so they made it blue raspberry.
my favorite sour patches were always the lemon and orange ones
You can dye the raspberry blue
In the immortal words of Randy Feltface; Blueberries are F-ing PURPLE
As a non-native speakers I always thought they where blueberries flavored cause in my country they are labeled as blueberries flavored.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT GRAPE AND BANANA FLAVOR ARE MADE FROM
THE OLD INTRO IS BACK!  MAKE SURE YOU HAVE DO THE SAME THING FOR STYLE THEORY!
4:34 I see what you did there 😂
I would love some  blue
My best friend favourite flavour is blue raspberry 💀

Flavor or no flavor. SUPER GOOD
Lol I’m allergic to blue food dye and have been looking for a description of blue candy so thanks lol
My favorite Sour Patch Kids are the orange ones
Blue raspberry….the best fruit that never existed 💔💙
Grape? Oh you mean purple flavor
Blue
I have been asking myself this question whenever I try blue raspberry flavored things thank you for the answer
Ok, i always thought blue raspberry was just a raspberry, i was always confused about the bubblegum flavour, like what does bubblegum tastes like??
Mat, why was your cone coloured like the pan flag? Want to tell us something? We love you either way 😊
You absolutely know that Editor Dan added more blues than he was supposed to. Cheers mate I'll have some blue too!
This is so widely different from where I live in the EU. I don't know if it's the same in other EU countries, but here grape and cherry are really rare flavours, and I've never seen blue raspberry before at all! Strawberry is usually red, raspberries get a dark pink colour, orange is for oranges, yellow is usually for lemon (but may be for banana), green is kind of rare but is usually apple (or sometimes lime), blueberries get a dark blue, and a dark purple is for blackberries. If there is a cherry flavour, it will get red instead of strawberry, and strawberry will get a bright pink instead, otherwise a bright pink can be bubblegum. Sweets that only come in raspberry flavour (an example would be a popular valentines day treat which consists of raspberry flavoured gelatin hearts) are usually red, although not quite as bright as strawberry/cherry. I've never tried grape flavouring before, but I have seen it in stores a few times, where it's always a bright purple.
Blueberry
I already knew what ‘blue’ flavour is, it’s highlighter (I pray someone knows who I got this from)
Iz blue😅
Blue is a flavor and its my favorite flavor of everything
...What about blue coconut?
Stinky to be you my favorite sour patch kids flavor is lemon 🍋
I thought blue raspberry was a cross between blueberries and raspberries-
As much as I do like the blue candy, it doesn't taste like a raspberry. And I think another reason blue raspberry lasted as long as it did is because blue berry flavoring is pretty recent for one and that for a long time it was apparently difficult to make blueberry flavored candies due to the blueberry flavor not withstanding the high temperatures used in candy making. Though personally I sort of think that the blue flavor should be changed to coconut. Because I'm not sure if it's just me but when drinking coconut flavored blue drinks the coconut really comes out.
"Iz blue"
It’s raspberry with blue food colouring
Is a Otter-pop  characters a otter?
Can't wait for the otter pop lore video

"blue rasberry doesn't exist" that sounds like a challenge
The fact that you talked about blue gater I’m mad because of that. blue is the best gateraid it’s really the best

I always got told blue raspberry was a sort of candy and a flavor created in a lab, this just confirms it all
the intro was halarious

Blue flavor is so good
Blue is just sugar with a twist
Blue Gatorade is my favorite drink
I almost cried when my parents told me blue raspberries wernt real.    I didn’t eat raspberries for 3 or 4 years…
Blue
Its the only thing i know is completely fake but its my favorite flavor of everything... soda, ice cream, candies...
Blueberry
Thumbs up for Otter Pop lore!!!
I knew blue raspberry wasn’t a real thing but I always thought it was just a random artificial flavor
https://youtu.be/Z0JvYF0WF1o
So, you're saying, blue raspberry is a unique name given to a unique flavor set with a color that's not used elsewhere except blueberry. Sounds to me like blue raspberry is now an honest flavor.
Mat, no! If anyone should point out that blueberries are purple it's you! You traitor to random trivia!
3:26 i always thought that it was blueberry not blue raspberry
blue raspberry tastes like garbage to me,
I've never liked blue raspberry flavoring and never tasted right don't give me wrong I knew it wasn't raspberry and definitely not blue raspberry but just the flavor itself never tasted good taste like chemicals
Blue
Did that in true have a Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends reference in it

When Matthew makes style theory, his first video best be on the social stigmas behind clothing. Hearing him essentially explain why it’s ok to be a femboy would be hilarious and a highlight of my life.
I always thought the blue raspberry was the blackberry  I was also drinking the same ghost drink he put up there-
Blue is the most overrated color imo
Blu
Now that u mention it, i would like the otter pop Lore theory as well please.   - 🗣️ POST HASTE !! 🗣️

So once when i was younger i thought  blue raspberry was a real food and the start just had me dying 0:25
0:33 MATPAT IS PISSED!
What about bubble gum?
All of us want to know what is going on with the blue raspberry flavour
The classic grape flavor is mimicking Concord grapes a much more flavorful kind of grape that actually tastes similar to artificial grape candy and what the candy is mimicking.
I never heard of blue raspberry being referred to blue stuff here in Brazil, even for Gatorade, they always market as either tutti frutti flavor (which yes, can just as often come in pink) or as cotton candy flavor (and the idea of that flavor is just ingrained now in public conscious). The third option to describe blue flavors here usually is "blue sky, but it's usually closer to the cotton candy flavor. But thrn again the reason we don't associtate blue artificial flavors to a blue raspberry here in Brazil is because raspberry itself is not a common fruit flavor here at all, usually present only in imported products, you're far more likely to find some local fruit like "açaí" as a flavor than both red or blue raspberry. All that to say that when you asked me what blue flavor was I thought of a """natural""" fruit mix like tutti frutti or poli frutti instead of a single thing like a banana, cherry, grape or a strawberry.
Okay everybody is talking the lowie blue otter Pop but no one's talking about how there was two cosmic coconut otter Pops
So, I think this is the perfect video for an Air Up advertisement, just because, hope you guys are having a good day :))
Brain dead now bye. ✌
He actually made me question blue raspberry just because of the intro
We need an episode just on banna flavoring because banana flavor never has tasted like banana
Blueberry  only blueberry
Blue
It could have been magenta too
Not TRUE i have eaten a blue raspberry
I swear I saw blue raspberries in the store a few days ago actually
10:04 he said Diet Coke when I was drinking Diet Coke
I was literally thinking about how blue raspberry isn’t a real flavor just a few days before this video came out 😂
pls make a otter pop lore video
Hm interesting😮
Blue
blacraad
Not matpat destroying what i thought i knew in seconds
There is yellow raspberry
Now I have to patiently wait for the Otter Pop official timeline video!
what flavour is bubblegum though 👀👀
blu gatorade
I have eaten purple raspberries before, the bush grew around a red fence leaning against the barn. They were amazing
He is a genius
I didn't think artificial grape flavour tasted like grapes until my sister grew this amazing grape vine that legit tastes like the most amazing grape lolly flavour.
Blue berrys are FUCKING PURPLE
bro its gum the flavor blue rasberry😂
Does anybody else here really hate blue raspberry? Like, I think it tastes godawful. It seems like most people like it.
Blue chain                 👇🏻
I absolutely hate grape flavor because the medicine ruined it for me
Who here already knew this because they’re shady uncle crushed they’re dreams when they said they wanted to go to a blue rasberry patch.  Comment down here if that’s you
Blue.
I agree
It could also just be blue Curacao syrup
I don’t like blue raspberry so this was nice
I thought it was named after the dark indigo one
I hope someone makes a gmo blue raspberry in my life time.
Idk about you but I've never assumed blue raspberry tasted like raspberry.. mostly because most of the other "fruit flavors" don't taste like anything but the flavor of candy/medicine. Cherry flavor doesn't taste like cherry, grape doesn't, banana doesn't, I think the only artificial flavor that actually makes me think of the regular food is lemon- And even then, not quite.
11:02 I actually really appreciate artificial vanillia. I do bake a bit.  And I'm too broke for real vanilla.
Blue Raspberry and Green Apple are my favorite candy flavors.
I was the person in the back saying blue Em'Em'es  made of chocolate
Funny enough, in Mexico we have some sodas which are red and don't have a distinct flavor other than sugary water (they're not strawberry or cherry), so many people just say they're "red flavored"
Yes! We need to know the lore of otter pops!
I am waiting for the day that Mat goes over the banana flavoring origin story and why the candy flavoring is nothing like the actual fruit.
blue.
Duh
I refuse to believe this. No.
How did i not know Otter Pops have funkos
Id try some of that blue
Blue being a red flag in nature also applies to humans. If you think you might want to date a girl with blue hair, don’t.  Run.
Please do an otter pop lore vid. DO IT
As far as i know i have never had otter*pops ever, yes i have had ICEE's but never otter*pops. Knowing how bad my memory can be i probably have had otter*pops but just don't remember
Blueberry 🫐
Learn to love jesus
Half of video blueballing us lol
I always thought Blue Raspberry was a combination of blueberry and raspberry flavor with and extra punch of sugar for sweetness 🤷‍♀️
Before getting into the meat of this video, lemme say something: As someone who for whatever weird genetic or other reason can taste many supposedly tasteless food colorings, I can tell you that blue tastes like erioglaucine or indigotine.
I just assumed it was blueberry plus raspberry
I swear to god when I was a kid I thought it was an actual fruit
Blue raspberry jolly ranchers tastes like pear to me
I had always thought it was the mix of blue berry and raspberry flavoring
Blueeeeeeee
green apple + grape = blue raspberry
So some people actually do call blackberries "blue raspberries".
Since grape flavor never tastes like grapes, I always call grape flavors purple.
Nah I saw it at the store in maryland💀
Blue
Why is it said the sky is blue because of the ocean when water literally is colorless? That makes no sense to me.
What about the hybrid raspberry that is grown in Ontario, Canada locally known as a blue raspberry?
“Blue Raspberry is a lie”? What’s next? “PINK LEMONADE IS A LIE”?
“ Blue” raspberry doesn’t really exist
Im not watching this discrace of a vid i just wanted to coment on this and if this is not actually blue raspberry you ruined my life
Blue berries are Purple!

Blueberry: ‘Why am I non-existent?’ 💀
Blue? I thought that, on average, red was the world's favorite colour  Also, I always thought the blue flavour was blueberry
#OTTERPOPTHEORY
I had a stretch bkue ring octopus toy but all it's rings wore off and IDk where he is :( If I even have him still and he didn't get thrown out Sadge
Is it not just blueberry and raspberry???
itss okay just rememeber that green apple and grape still exist
"blueberries are f****** violet" - Randy Feltface
As a non-native speaker I always assumed "blue raspberry" was what you called blackberries until I looked it up. They kind of are very dark blue raspberries XD I also only knew that flavour because of slushies. I had no idea that the US had so much demand for that flavour in other stuff.
If I remember correctly, grape flavored candy is actually flavored like grape, just a specific type of grape, might be concord but i don’t remember
Mat got the romania flavored ice cone 😂
I learned the red thing in English class
Hi
But Concorde (is that the spelling) grapes have the quintessential grape flavor right
Who else didnt know there were a style theorists until this video 👇
Blue
Wait so the blue raspberries at are as a kid off a tree wasn’t real nah I swore they existed is this like some Mandela effect
Koolaid is fire
so blue raspberry is just blue flavored raspberry?
Blueberry’s are purple!!!
I like the color blue
I always called it smurf(Schlumpf)  flavour, and im kinda sure other people do that too in germany :P
Blueberry
Do an otter pop lore theory
Well my favourite flavour is lemon-lime.  And not blue so there
I never that blue rasverry were a thing 😊
WELL MAYBE  YOU MIGHT BE INCORRECT BECAUSE THE BLUE FLAVORE IS BLUEBERRY HAHAHAHAHAHA BUT YOUR VIDS ARE COOOL
Hi
This is so dumb because blue raspberry is real fruit
You are actually eating an real raspberry.
9:36 so hes actually the first place, cause, eddisons pattents were not eddisons work
So, fruit punch is what I've been having this whole? Who would've thought of it, I'm calling it fruit punch from now onwards!
I was waiting to watch this cause I was gonna send it to a girl in my class who thought blue raspberry was a real fruit Her excuse was she’s asian
Blue
What flavor is it really? I thought that about bubble gum. Like, it's such a staple flavor that someone just created for gum, and now it's just everywhere.
Cool blue Gatorade tastes like the nectar of the gods
Blue
Please don't do an otter pop lore theory video
Blue
lime is best
i live for this intro skits🤣
Otter Lore!!
otter pop lore video when?
The flavor of blue taste like a raspberry or should I say berry, so there you go game theory 😲🤔
i imagine blue raspberry should taste like blueberry and raspberry.
Blue is best
Grape candy does taste like grapes. Just eat a Concord grape, nerd.
matpat is so painfully millenial and outdated, but the video ideas make it work
4:32 "now we all know what licking ariel would taste like"  Can somebody PLEASE make an out of context meme out of this?
Fun fact, the grape flavor of our candies does exist. Grapes like Shine Muscat in Japan tastes VERY close to the grape candy I grew up with in the States.
We absolutely need an otter pop lore video.
Blueberry?
Don’t diss unicorn magic
raspberry but called blue
I love the introduction because of da word... BLUE!
My favorite flavor of a lot of things is blue raspberry actually, so this was really interesting!!
Did you know that grape is a grape flavor it’s just not the ones you buy at the store I believe they are called concord grapes don’t tack my word for it I might be wrong
We definitely need an otter pop lore video
I usually pick the flavor as lemonade raspberry,. The added colour producing a sweater flavor, as well as a hint of grape
Reminds me of how the blue tongued skink flicks its tongue to ward off predators
Dan in the beginning is my favorite person
As a person who grew up by denoting flavors by color for juice candies etc. This opening bit gave me life!!!! 😂
OTTER POP LORE THEORY!!!
Otter pops need lore videos like v tuner branches
Blu
I find it fascinating how regional that is. In my country (Poland) blue has usually bubble gum or tropical fruit flavour (because, you know, blue ocean is surrounding tropical islands) and it never even occured to me that it might be different in other countries! I could say I'm a little obsessed over blue food, if I have a choice I will always go for that color. I wonder if it would be the same if it was raspberry flavour like in US
I have a theory about a game called my singing monsters, some items and even monsters in the games represent times like right now, so maybe this is a evolve thing from right now like an acid spill or maybe the world turns Magical I love to see you do theory on this. It could be on game theory sense well it’s a game and I think you should play it. It’s Fun
Otter Pop Lore.  We need it.
the problem with a.i. :   its NOT alive. it draws on whatever data base was put into it. soooooooooo what ...data base...are these writers pooling from? and will it get diluted thru many people making so many differnt variations overtime? would the original even be recognize able?
Blue raspberry  is made in a laboratory
Wait do people really think blue raspberry is just blue colored raspberry flavor? I never thought it tasted like raspberry. I always knew it was artificial and the use of the word raspberry was just some marketing thing. Lmao
9:33 he wouldn’t happen to know a Tavish, would he?
Otter pop, food theory do it do it as your next episode next week I want to see the otter pop Siri please do this I’m begging you I’m really interested in this story
fun fact, pink lemonade was accidentally invented at a circus/festival when a performer was washing his red tights in the same river as a lemonade stand owner. the lemonade guy went to go get more water for his lemonade and the river water had turned pink from the dye of the red tights. he didn’t have time to get fresh water so he said it was a fancy new pink lemonade and people believed it was better
I've always hated blue rasberry. Every time you would ask the question "What does it actually taste like," I said sugar
PLEASE MAKE A FAKE GRAPE EPISODE :)
Blue.
I NEED otter pop lore NOWWW
Sounds like this guy eats pretty crappy grapes
now!!!!!
add cartoon theory
Cool mat, but blueberry and blue raspberry will always be the superior flavors.
I want a food theory video on Otter*Pops
Blueberry why didn’t you think of that?😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Me: eating a ton of blue raspberry Jolly Ranchers while watching this video
Has anyone heard of ‘’blue berry’’???🫐🫐🫐
BLUE               Red is better               The end
Blue raspberryis blueberry I think
wait ... blue raspberry isn't real? 😨
I love how every time I watch a food theory video I notice more stuff. What dose home of the big mat, & 117 subscribers mean though?
The intro is so funny i love this episode so much one of my favorites by far
But you have blue in your snow cone
It's funny because i used to think blue raspberry was a flavor. For some reason my brain used to think it was just raspberries and blue color. My child like my brain back then lol
I try to impress my classmates with these facts but they all watch your videos.
Ok yea its true but blue raspberry is still the the best sour patch kids flavor
Why the heck can’t they just make the flavor blue blueberries??
He has way too much salt.
Blueberry
I always thought Blue raspberry was supposed to just be a blueberry and raspberry combo flavor. You can actually stick a blueberry into the hollow part of the raspberry, and eat the whole thing, and it will taste like what the artificial flavor tastes like.
Grape doesn't taste like grape and banana doesn't taste like banana.
“What licking Ariel tastes like” 👌😂
Blue raspberry flavor are made from whitebark raspberries!!
Matt Patt use GOOGLE?!
hmmm
IVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS
I have a chocolate shop and tried some recipes with blueberry the results are always purple there is some blue natural  pigments but those pigments doesn't have flavor.
Matt incorrectly attributes the blue coloring of our favorite blue raspberry products to mainly the dye, blue no. 2(indigo). Most of the candy and drinks in the United States that are dyed blue actually use the dye, Blue no.1 (brilliant blue), which could be a possible carcinogen according to some studies.
no crap
Bluerasberry
Blueberry
blue raspberry tastes like a science lab and yes I licked every corner of one jk
This is what taxpayer dollars should be used for
If I dont get an otterpop lore theory video I will be beyond sad
😂 parody time:when you eat your smarties do you eat the blue ones last 😂
I mean i would honestly love an otter pops episode
Indigo what happens if you add a  w  to indigo… windigo 💀
What about blue berry
I Need Otter Pop lore now
Why is the orange flavored otter pop an orphan?
Bro just Google it to see if blue raspberries are real
Blue berry 💙
you know something they actually took out the raspberry juice and put a flavor that's supposed to make it taste just like Blue Raspberry and that thing it's supposed to make the actual Berry As blue as that thing makes the berry blue but the leaves stay green so these blue raspberries are all made in a lab
I always thought blue taste like soda
My favorite pizza is Spinach pizza
Speaking of blue, my sister recently discovered an ice cream we've never heard of before and it's just called 'blue moon' we're not sure what flavor it's supposed to be, my sister says blue raspberry but I disagreed because. Blue raspberry is kind of sour isn't it and to me the ice cream was just sweet, in fact I didn't get any fruity-ness at all. My first thought was cotton candy but I don't know, possibly a new theory idea if you haven't done it yet who knows.
what FLA-VEOR DID YOU GET DAN
Sorry I'm still gonna eat blue raspberry it tastes so good 😭
I honestly have so many questions about amaranth like if amaranth is poisonous then why do some people use it as cooking ingredients and if amaranth tastes like raspberry then why aren't raspberries poisonous?
Cool blue taste like blue strawberries
Isn’t cotton candy flavor raspberry and vanilla together to?
Blue
genuinely always thought blue raspberry was just blueberry and raspberry combined...
What da hill is otter pops?!? It’s so strange to someone raised on zooper doopers.
My guy, you don't need scissors for otter pops. Snap them in half.
JoJo fans be like 0:39 IS THAT A JOJO REFERENCE
Actually, there are blue raspberries, and not Rubus Leucudermis but Rubus caesius. They are actually blue and grown in northern Europe but are exceedingly rare except on the island of Gotland (who calls them Salmbär or Salmberry, not to be confused with salmonberry which is a very different thing). The local specialty is saffron pancakes with blue raspberry jam, it is darn tasty.  It however taste nothing like the so called "blue raspberry" in candy and soft drinks but they are real, I have eaten them. They are close to blueberries in color, sometimes a bit darker. There are of course some garden variety blueberries that are blue too, but they don't taste the same.
Have you ever tried Concord grapes?
Why does snow cone look like the pansexual flag?
Shane Dawson podcast literally just talked about blue raspberry like 2 weeks ago lmao

Bruh blue raspberry is a flavor of medicine too but that’s the worst flavor
Because I've always wondered
Maybe you should do of what coke is made of
My whole childhood is a lie 💀😢
Bro the flavor is blue🟦

Never really had anything blue rasberry flavor... maybe blueberry... is this more of an American thing
03:25 .... blueberry 🫐? Matpat:👁️👄👁️
Bruh you saying you don’t know this
So everyone loves blue drinks and food, is that why Walter’s product was so popular besides being pure?
I almost died when the theme song came on because I was staring directly into my screen to observe blue snow cone
Dan: Blue Madpad: Whararwhararrr Dan: Blue.
At my job i have blue fruit that looks like raspberry's
Thanks a lot I’ve been waiting for this answer
I want Otter Pop lore.
You can also get Jamaica flavor Cool Aid
I need real blue rasberries
All i know is that blue raspberry syrup and redbull is my ambrosia and keeps me sane. It could be bug bile and id still drink it. It's delicious
“Blue isn’t a flavor, Dan “ “You have blue in your snow cone Mathew Patrick”
I want scientists to make a blue raspberry now. Come on, theyve made things like bananas edible, so it shouldnt be that hard. Find the pigment controller found in berry plants, and somehow get one of the berries to be blue.
I want an otter pop episode please
You should do a music theorists channel
Song name 7:39
BRO STOP I LIKE BLUE IF YOU HATE THIS WHY MAKE A VIDEO
the blue sour patch kids ghosts are fucking fire
EVERYONE LIKES COLA EVEN IF THE REAL COLOR IS GREEN
Blue is all dan knows and shovint a snowcone in our face thanks. Mmmm. Delicious.
blue raz in some diy flavor scenes is basically raspberry and peach combined for some reason.
What taste is like
Bluuuue
“Blue”
The funny thing is, blue raspberry isn't really a thing in other countries. Never heard of a real popular thing flavoured blue raspberry in Germany. We do have blue sweets and drinks, but they're usually blueberry or not associated with any (fruit) flavour at all - like the "smurf ice cream".
4:02 This just played the Randy Feltface clip of him yelling   "Blueberries are F Purple"
Time for someone to genetically engineer us some blue raspberries.
I don’t know why, but the thumbnail looks like a masterpiece 😄
in austraia there is no dragon or mermaid flavor, its just UNICORN
If you want to know what the mermaid flavored snack packs are like, they taste like someone barf up milk inside of a container and then threw a whole bunch strawberry blended out and then put chocolate in it taste really gross
I've always thought the color of raspberry is magenta, because of Mr. Sketch scented markers.
Yes, do an otter pop lore episode!!
The drink theories
Blueberry and Raspberry!!
Actually grape flavor does taste like grapes: specifically concord grapes.
I’d watch a theory about otter pops
Blueberries aren’t blue, they’re purple >=( (I’m joking)
I know how cool blue tastes like
6:09 Why is that so specific yet so true?
red rasberries: * exist * people: "no strawbarries are red, rasberrys are BLUE"
I am De Groote!
Hello matpat
If not friend why friend shaped
After 8:55 minutes of hearing you rant never answering the actual flavor I stopped watching. You ou really need to take something for your manic episodes to just simply answer your question and not overthink it.
Blueberry
Blue
As a blue raspberry lover, this is intresting.
Grape flavor does taste like grapes though. Specifically concord grapes. Like how banana flavor is gro Michel not Cavendish flavor.
Did... did people think blue raspberry tasted like raspberry?          I thought it was pretty obvious it wasnt    maybe                      Im just                            constructed                                 alternativley                                                                                                                                                                                 o h   n o                                                                                                          will it end?                                                        why you click                                               maybe juts hit one of thse?                cool vidbtw
Thanks Dan for the lick of your blue flaverd snowcone ( 0:44 )
Blue is for bubble gum  Which is funny mat mencions that pink is for bubble gum too, also true, but in my country i grew to learn blue is for bubble gum, and as more brands and candies made their way here we also learned that blue is for raspberry and pink for bubble gum, making us have or own beliefs but this mixing with diferent ones, the same way colonizers managed to change our religions, but this is candy and dosen't have a bunch of murder and other bad stuff
I just love head-editor Dan :-D
when i was younger why did i use to think that blue raspberry was just another berry that was blue
I wanna genetically engineer blue raspberries.
I only have one comment for this video.  Dabadee dabadie.
You should do a video on why banana flavored items don’t taste like banana. It’s so weird. Great video!!
I was so confused for a while cause from where i'm from we translate Rubus Caesius to blue raspberry, Rubus Caesius is a type of dew berry, specifically the European Dewberry
I, for one, have always hated blue raspberry so
blue rasberry isnt real but arent blue berries?
Yeah Matpat is actually right I have never seen or heard anyone who has seen a blue raspberry
So sour cherry Banana?
4:28 another out of context moment
Please do a theory on the otters in OtterPops!
I always just assumed it was a mix of blueberries and raspberries. I haven’t finished the video so I’ll see what it is!
It is normally you eat with your eyes first, then your sense of smell, then depending on the type of food sound, then mouth feel and then the last is taste. What you perceive for taste is mostly by what you see and smell. When you take once sense away from a food that food will taste different. Sound does make a difference in flavor and texture. For example, take a pretzel for instance and find lets say 3 sounds, first eat the pretzel without sound to get a base taste and texture, then play that sound of choice (I had chosen falling tree sound, falling rocks, and gravel.) and notice how each and different sound changes the flavor and texture of that pretzel. You are eating the same substance but your brain thinks different. I find it fascinating how your senses can change what you perceive when you take one sense out.
We don't have blue raspberry in Europe, and it's 2023.  Just FYI.
Uhhh Blue Berry
“Everything that has blue is dangerous”   *Me, being the biggest idiot in the world with blue eyes” 💀
Drink an AMF and tell me what u remember after
Pink lemonade next?
What if the guy was colorblind…
Y’all’s never herd of blueberry
NO NOT THE BLUE SOUR PATCH. I LOVE THE BLUE SOUR PATCH
“grape doesn’t taste like grape”
COTTON CANDY!!!! is the Blue Flavor
This is my opinion but personally blue raspberry  disgusting😖
Dan is on a higher level of consciousness hes tasting colors
Raspberries, don’t be blue! Just be true (to yourselves) :D
why do you start each sentence with a grunt?
your life is giveing us info were to lazy to get
I have an air freshener that smells purple.  I've had many different people confirm: it smells purple.
4:31 hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Blueberry
I adore grapes, but despise grape flavored candies. Good to know why they taste so different
Matpat, if you dont do a otter pop lore video I'm unsubscribing from all your channels
i love the flavor blue
otter pop lore
i like the theory but, i dont think anyone thought blue raspberry's were real.
Hi
We all know, MatPat.
THANK YOU SO MUCH I have always wanted to know 😭
Matpat should do an Otter pop lore video
Looking forward to the “grape ain’t grape” video
Blue theory
it is blue berry x rassberrie
oo this was very interesting
lol I was actually just thinking of this very thing just a little over a week ago
It’s called blue
it tastes good
Blueberry
Yeah, I don't think any artificial fruit flavor actually tastes like any real fresh fruit.  But I still associate them with fruit anytime I taste them.
Crip
Rubus leucodermis Is the flavor blue raspberry I thought everyone knew this
Main editor dan:blue
cant we just call it what it is? B L U E B E R R Y
One, I’m having a blue raspberry lollipop rn… two I also love grape
Gotta love blue flavor 🤭🤭✨✨
and here i was thinking it was just a combination of blueberry and raspberry
Really milking the watch time, MatPat. You ask "what is blue raspberry" like 5 times throughout the video, but give us mostly a history lesson until the last minute of the video when you awkwardly segue into the actual flavor
you can snap otter pops in half
Matpat: want a blue flavor use blueberry Randy feltface: blue berries are purple
blueberry
well , now it's time to create a blue rabsberry using selective breeding with also the same flavor
In germany blue raspberry is called Brombeere ( i think you call them blackberry )
Looking forward to Matpat's deep dive into Otter Pop lore
i always knew that blue raspberry wasn't real, my headcannon was that they just ran out of colors for raspberry and picked blue,  but now i know that blue raspberry isn't even raspberry
Everyone we gotta get out of here he’s got a blue as a flavor he can taste color
Wait a minute though. I thought that purple was the most rare color in the natural world. It was certainly the most expensive. It took like thousands of a certain clam or something I can’t remember the name of just to produce a relatively small amount of dye. And it shows even today. When was the last time you saw someone with purple clothing? As in mostly purple.
Wait you call them blue raspberry?? I just call them "Y'know..the the little food thing that's blue? Idk what flavor it is"
Ha and the current mat pat jacket is blue
wait hold on, you mean people believe blue raspberry is different flavour?
Isn’t it just blueberry + raspberry ???
what is there not to understand, the flavor is blue
Whenever i say my favorite flavor is "blue rasberrry" people get so confused.😂
My grandma  showed  me blue  rasbery
i have always known blue raspberry isn't a real thing and it is so weird to me that only recently i've noticed you americans are figuring out there are no blue raspberries😀😀
To be honest I looove blue raspberry like ask me what my favorite flavor anything is (if it has blue raspberry) and I will answer blue raspberry
4:25 bro- 💀💀 next is gonna be the ceiling or the smart kid at school-
e
I've never even seen that flavour used in anything.
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
How ,bout purple
Blue 😒
Lol what a fun video 👍👍👍
I like the blue raspberry taste.. idk why. I like sour, citrus, and tangy flavor and blue usually taste the best, but turns your tongue blue. I also like lemon, lime, and cherry. Not sure if those are similar.
Food theory idea: if digestion begins in the mouth with enzymes in saliva, how long would it take a gallon of human saliva at room temperature to completely dissolve a canned ham?   Side note i have no idea how you would successfully get a gallon of human saliva for this so i understand if it never pans out.
I just aggressively said chemicals every time the question of what blue raspberry taste like whenever it was asked. I've known it's basically pure chemicals for years now, and when I say my favorite flavor is blue raspberry I say chemicals got to love them.
iz blue
In this he has mcrs mid channel regret syndrome when he talks about otter pops

Cherry > blue raspberry
11:07 cocanie
I was like WHAT THE 9? 5:04
Blue. Just Blue. Also i hate grape it reminds me of medicine. ;-;
Blur best flavor
I love how you said blue raspberry? But then I went NONO NO I SAID BLUEBERRY!!!

The Otter Pop crew, Alexander the Grape, Little Orphan Orange, Sir Isaac Lime, Poncho Punch, and Louie-Bloo Raspberry have gone on many adventures together over the years. Here are a few examples of their imaginative escapades:  The Otter Pop Olympics: The Otter Pop crew decides to host their own Olympics, with each character competing in their own event. Alexander the Grape shows off his speed in the Grape Dash, Little Orphan Orange showcases her gymnastic skills in the Orange Beam, Sir Isaac Lime wows the judges with his synchronized swimming routine, Poncho Punch takes on the surfing competition, and Louie-Bloo Raspberry uses his mischievousness to win the Blue Ribbon for practical jokes.  The Great Otter Pop Rescue: The Otter Pop crew hears about a group of stranded animals on a nearby island and sets off on a rescue mission. They work together to build a boat, navigate treacherous waters, and use their unique talents to save the stranded creatures. In the end, they make it back home safely, and the animals are reunited with their families.  Otter Pop Detective Agency: The Otter Pop crew transforms into detectives, working together to solve a mystery in their neighborhood. Alexander the Grape takes on the role of the mastermind, Little Orphan Orange is the undercover agent, Sir Isaac Lime uses his sharp mind to analyze clues, Poncho Punch is the lookout, and Louie-Bloo Raspberry is the sneaky one who gathers evidence. Together, they crack the case and bring the culprit to justice.  Otter Pop Space Adventure: The Otter Pop crew blasts off into space, exploring new galaxies and encountering all sorts of strange creatures. Alexander the Grape takes on the role of captain, Little Orphan Orange becomes the ship's engineer, Sir Isaac Lime is the navigator, Poncho Punch cooks up delicious space meals, and Louie-Bloo Raspberry is the one who makes first contact with the alien life forms they encounter. They discover new worlds and have many adventures before returning home to Earth.

Blurb
HAHA now i can stump my friends with the question "What is the flavor of blue?" and they will say "Blue raspberry" and i would say "It's nothing!" or air
Blue raspberry is fake?… Edit: bblluuee.
Blue rasberry is actually a real thing and its Called ”salmbär”. They Grow on a swedish island called ”Gotland”.
Otter Pops lore NOW
Dan is obviously not a cop.
Cut out the first 50 seconds I came to hear about a fake flavor not listen to a grown man whine in a half assed skit.
who actually thought blue raspberries were real
I always assumed it was just weird name for blackberry, nice theory.
Please do the "Grape" Episode!
blue
blue taste like bubblegum
BREAKING NEWS: Someone on the internet just figured out something we already knew.
Cool Blue is orange flavored it’s confusing and I literally had to stop drinking it (replaced with a different blue Gatorade lol)
mayby blue rasberry is the mandela efect 🤔😯😯😯🤯🤯
I'm sorry, but you lost me 3/4 of the way through when you called Thomas Edison, "the greatest inventor." Number of Patents held - especially in the early days of patent law - does not an inventor make. Edison was a shred businessman and a thief, not a prolific inventor. I expect better from your big brain Mat.
I live in a part of the uk where sour patch kids don't come with blue, instead they have more natural flavours like blackcurrent or lime
Bluey da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
Blueberry and razberry
I've never heard of blue raspberry until now.
the ice cream truck always had blue "smurf" ice cream and since then I refuse to eat blue ice unless its called smurf. The rip-off truck called it "angel ice cream" - disgusting I'm also probably the only adult who buys the haribo smurfs...
Me……pops a piece of sour patch blue raspberry gum then sees this video… yep let’s watch it lol 😂
Blue
I always thought blue raspberry was blackberry
oh you mean blackberries
When you watch this and you like blue food because of PJO
Blue is rare? It’s half of everything I see outside, and covers 70% of the world’s surface!
Blue Raspberry may not be real but orange Raspberries are real I seen them  IRL
Wow, this episode just voiced my ever present distrust of blue things in  food… I find it unnatural and stay awaaay from it
Blue raspberry actually tastes like a yellow raspberry to me, but no one know about those so whatever.
Why didn't blueberry blue take off?
I never thought about it but that is interesting
I would honestly enjoy an otter pop lore video from MatPat
I’m a grape guy too you should do a video about that
4:32 pfffffffffffff
3:47 lmao
When Matt said he ruined childhoods he meant it. I can now no longer look at my favorite flavor the same way again😭
Sir this is a Wendy's
"Blue" - Dan
When was tutti-frutti when I was a kid.
Why do I have to trust this?  I don't like it. 😞  Oh Why?  Make an apology to your self  I'm not  happy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢
Licking areil omds matpat🤦🏾‍♂️🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think it just tastes like rassbery but blue

Juicebox: *NO ARTIFICIAL FLAVORING*  Also juicebox: _blue raspberry flavor_
I’d like a BLUE Gatorade please

blue
Yes!!! Otter Pop lore...I'd love to see that video!
When I’m watching this video, my brother is eating blue raspberry push pop, but I told my brother it’s not real flavor
Also, idc what you say, blue raspberry is still a freaking good flavor.
Wweeeellll, we have blueberries so, maybe it’s just a different name. Idfk how am I supposed to know.
now I'm wondering what a slightly sour caramel bannana tart (or other desert thing) would taste like.
Ah yes a original flavor: B L U E
i need the otter pop lore theory.
Otter pops theory?
Matt should make a theory on the blue waffle
You gonna have to do a video explaining what flavor bubble gum actually is.
I found out this video was a thing at one of my friends birthday party
My kids will never have to grow up struggling to open those ice pops: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jgli2kBmk1A
There was a while there bout a year ago I convinced myself Blue raspberry was a mix between blueberry and raspberry even to the point I could taste it, then I googled it and saw I was wrong. This video makes me feel better for being able to convince myself of that
Opener is an actual recording of a conversation had during a work event that served snocones. Lol
He needs to make a channel with just random theories
The Food Theorists on 12:10 : ''... so yeah, blue raspberry, your fav sour patch kid flavour...''' Me: I have never tried a sour patch kid
isn't blue just simply blueberry?
😱😱😱
WHAT FLAVOUUUR DID U GET"
I sometimes just listen to your videos to slightly boost productivity with other things I do at the same time but I didn't expect you to say "Now we know what licking Arielle would taste like". That just threw me
Dan is me like I’m just sat there screaming blue
I have been waiting for an Otter Pop lore theory.
Blue raspberry is just blueberries and raspberry. Who doesn't know this?
You should do one on how all the fruit juices you buy in the store has apple or pear juice as the majority of the juice, because pear and apple juice flavors can be overridden by pretty much anything with a small amount of that other flavor.
I think randy feltface said this best but blueberries aren't blue, they are purple
I just like that it makes my tongue Blue
otter pop lore pleaseee
5ds
Do a otterpop episode
That beginning thing was funny
Blue rasberry is a mix of red rasberry and another flavor
Imagine showing a little kid a theory from matpat they would have a mental breakdown
Blue
please make the otter pop theory
I looked this up years ago, and your findings confirm mine. Thank your sir!
Otter pops the new fnaf
Blue what blue juice blue bugs blue frogs
The Van Leeuwen ice cream brand has an ice cream flavor that actually has blue raspberry extract on the ingredient list. Which is clearly a blatant lie since you can’t get extract from something that doesn’t exist.
Lmao I don’t like sour patch kids but I do like Fruit and the two I buy the most are blue berries and raspberries and I get blue raspberry by putting a blue berry into a raspberry and eating it like that😂
talking about artificial flavor, I never like Durian-flavored snack, even though the durian fruit it self is good and I like it. It's enough to convince me that artificial flavor is not taste like the actual fruit :|
Matpat - what is the flavor of blue? HAH exactly there I-  Me - blueberry
You can also just cook down raspberry syrup till it slightly caramelizes and put in a sweet fruit vinegar, then steep in hibiscus flowers or put in blue cabbage extract.  Tastes like blue raspberry.
Blue
But it’s kinda funny because blue raspberry is the best flavor ever
I have a blue slime while watching this "bkue video" And i yeeted my slime to the sky after seeing this.
I saw real life rarest blue raspberry me HOW IT BLUE?!
GRAPEEEE.

Matpat gaslighting me for 13 minutes and 5 seconds to believe blue raspberries arent real

I like pirple flavor
Flavour.
Cool blue tastes like orange... Not quite but it is loaded with citric acid and is citrus flaivored. Speaking as someone who drank too much Cool Blue Gatorade. Also Glacier Cherry is supreme.
If natural things that are blue are dangerous, then is sonic the hedgehog dangerous? New game theory video
7:10 sums up the exact conversation i had in my head one day, trying to rationalize the color choices that these brands were selecting for specific flavors. color theory is wild
welp i accidentally put my computer on alone and forgot about it and now its the  next day.
B L U E
Ooooooohhhhh. Cool!
Blue food. Looking for yall
Blue berry.
Do a video on why a certain banana flavor candy taste different than today’s bananas
The opening reminds me of a Jim gaffigan joke
There you go again asking the questions that really matter.
i thought it was a combination of blueberry and raspberry flavor
Ok but my question, what is about blue lemonade too?
Here's a theory why has no one discover the flavor of the back sodas?
i think its blueberry
6:43 They accidentally gave the astronaut and the one next to her the same name.
Here it is literally just blueberries, fortunately where i live we don't have a fake flavour that people are obsessed with
So, blue raspberry is apparently a mixture of Cherry, raspberry, Banana, and Pineapple.
A geneticist should genetically engineer a real blue raspberry
Greg from how to drink had an interesting thought. Its orange.
Just shut up
I already knew blue raspberry was fake. I heard somewhere that it's completely chemical, and I believe it.
Poor Percy Jackson and his mom I hope their dam world haven’t been chrushed
Blue blueberry would make more sense than blue raspberry.
I was worried i wouldnt like munchos anymore, but apparently im special or smth and never thought it tasted like rasberry anyway. Idk banana laffy taffy
Isn't blue raspberry just blue berries and raspberries? 🤔 They are both berries and the "blue" from blueberries and "raspberry" from raspberries RESULTING IN BLUE RASPBERRY 💅✨
Vid starts here: 4:56
I remember as a children, in Canada we had this budget line of soda pop called "The Pop Shoppe".  Among their 32 flavours was a Raspberry soda that I used to LOVE and it was a dark red colour.  Pop Shoppe disappeared in 1984 or 1985 as the company went bankrupt but I still remember that dark red, sweet nectar.
as someone with a Dorito stuck on their finger, I approve of this message.
My favorite candy flavor is fake 😳
Blue raspberry is raspberries and blueberry’s mixed together
man I can't believe people were afraid of amaranth considering how popular she curranty is
I don’t know what it is, but it taste so good
This video is stupid because it’s blue berry x raspberry but to make it short we say blue raspberry
Did anyone else notice that mats snow cone is the pan flag colors
Grape flavors are based on Concord grapes not table grapes. Think the flavor of grape juice.
6:56 y e s
BLUE BERRYS ARE FUCKING PURPLE
Is pansexual an icecream flavor?
i agree with dan.
This video needs to go viral
Grape flavor actually DOES taste like grape and did a very good job of getting the right flavor profile. The flavor is actually "concord grapes" and the candy and grape taste the same.
hmmmm... yes, do otter pop lore. DO IT RIGHT NOW. if you dont ill unsubscribe (:
you can snap an otter pop in half instead of chewing the end off if you dont have scissors to open it
This was fantastically illuminating. And as someone who doesn't like artificial grape flavor, I would like that episode.
Didn’t know amouranth would make a cameo
We all know it was made for marketing because there is to many reds colours.
I thought that evryone knew this was aa lie though
Blue
Matpat, I have a completely different theory on this. I think that some company probably just wanted a raspberry flavor, but,  there is already strawberyy, watermelon, and cherry, all red/pink flavors. So, somebody was like "blue." That is probably the most likely reason for this.
Speaking of why are foods such outrageous colors? like who wants a Barbie pink pudding? or a fire truck red fruit punch? why are food colors the way they are? its weird man and it doesn't help that 90% percent of snacks are that color too.
This is the first time I have seen a Food Theory episode while not sick, these are actually really good.
at many icecream places where i live there will be a blue flavor which is sometimes called unicorn but what ive seen most is the name smurf which is absolutly histerical to me if you think about it
Food theory idea: how does nitro Pepsi work?
I may be related to Melvin De Groote, thanks matpat, helping me find my family through history 😅
While watching this vid I had a blue drink LOL
Blue flavor! Blue flavor!
Not True!
Wait a minute the one you said that matpat is from 🇨🇴 they actually sell the 🇨🇴 one Coloerd one in 🇺🇸which might mean that matpat is from 🇺🇸
6:53  Otter pop lore Sounds like a good idea
Your theory’s are bad
Otter pop lore! Otter pop lore! Otter pop lore! Otter pop lore! Otter pop lore! Otter pop lore!
Brombeere
Omg
Not me thinking "Blue Raspberry" was just a hybrid flavor of blueberry and raspberry. 😂
me and my irrational hatred of the colour blue teal suffered during this episode
Did people actually think that blue raspberry is real???!!!!
bro I've been asking "why blue raspberry raspberries aren't blue" for the longest time
Blue.
YESSSS you have to do a otter pop lore video
I don’t really like blue raspberry anyway, so it wasn’t a shocker finding out that blue raspberry was a fake flavor.
That was the best flavor of my childhood snacks!😢
Blue itself is just a flavor. Whenever someone says I got blue, we already know what it tastes likes.
I thought everyone knew this already- But oh well, ig people know it's not actually real now.
Can you talk about why watermelon flavor doesn’t taste a thing like watermelon? Everyone’s always surprised when I say I hate watermelon favored stuff but love eating watermelon.
When it comes to the Cool Blue Gatorade in my opinion it tastes like watered down water
what’s the ‘actual flavour’ of coke? as in coca cola
Dan: it's Blue...only Blue...easter egg from Monika? XD
Bluuuuuueeeeeeeeeeeeee
blueberry is the flavor of blue
Blue raspberry is my FAVORITE!!!
4:29 this could be so horribly out of context
Grape is always the worst flavor of anything. Real grapes taste great, but grape favoring is always a disappointment.
Blue
Grape flavoring does taste like grape, just Concord grape
“Blue”
Blueberry + Raspberry = Blue Raspberry.
0:27 iz blue Edit:thanks for 0 likes
I loath grape flavor :<
Grape stuff tastes like concord grapes
We need Otterpops theories! Need!
Still better than fucking orange
https://youtu.be/S3vwAW35I-M Rihanna megamix
I always just imagined it was a cross between blue berry and raspberry
Honestly I think orange sour patch kids are better
The flavor of blue is of elegance and domination. Elegance because it’s amazing and domination because blue takes over the world
Blue raspberry is real I have some in my fridge
im eating blue razzberry candy right now :)
its blue berry flavor.
Matpat... Blue Raspberries are just called Blackberries, and you're telling me that a Blackberry flavour is a complete lie, in which case that a blackberry was never meant to exist in the first place.  What were you thinking?
My heart is cold
so much is wrong with this
I remember eating a blue raspberry tho...
I swear blueberries are purple
Answer for people that are short on time:    The true flavor is a caramel-grape-cherry-banana-lemon with maybe just a tiny small bit of “raspberry”.
What if blue raspberry actually exists and hes just gaslighting us that it doesnt exist
Yes, do  an episode about Otterpop lore.❤
0:48 Bluuuuuuuuuue
Try eating a BLUEberry and a RASPBERRY at the same time and you will understand why they call it BLUE RASPBERRY. 🤷‍♀️😅
I thought it was blueberry and raspberry..
I just kinda assumed it was the it was blueberry flavoring and the raspberry flavoring mixed.
id say my favourite flavour on candies is orange or strawberry but blueberry flavour is good too
The fact that I’m eating blur raspberry candy right now is just hilarious
Blue
So bizarre to think Matpat didn't pick blackberries for a blue raspberry in real life. Are they widespread in the USA?   In Russia, we grow them in our summer gardens, but they are harder to grow than raspberries, and there are always fewer of them, so they are treasured by children as one of the coolest berries in the garden. So any blackberry-flavored candy is usually highly appreciated.  Thinking of that... in the USSR almost every family was given a nice piece of land for free not too far from their towns. People were usually building cheap summer houses there and used them as a place to go and relax or garden in summer. It was also a source of a lot of fruits and vegetables. Imagine even the poorest families owning land... And the factory my grandfather worked at was donating materials to build a house to every worker, so he built a house himself.
BLEUBERRIES ARE F&$@ING PURPLE!!!!  -Randy Feltface
Bro asked me what the taste was and I said blueberry lol
I like the yellow sour patch kids
The beginning hahahhah😂😂
ok the blue raspberries are not real but the blue strawberries are real
Otterpoo lote explanation when?
Blue raspberry sucks
"blue raspberry" , "grape" , and "banana" flavours hit different
Delicoise 3:27
I'm drinking a blue razbery slrupie
Matpat. Blueberries are purple. Look at the inside. The outside is way less blue than that photo shows
How does the lorax work and what do they ears there's nothing alive other then humans
You should do a theory on why the smarties in the US are different from everywhere else!!!!! I’ve always wanted to know and Ik lot of ppl who feel the same
Blueberries are F'n purple.
And a level three gymnast
Hi I’m a big fan
I’m blue da ba di dabidie dabi de you die
The only reason Blue Raspberry is blue is so people don't confuse it with some other red colored flavor like Strawberry or Cherry.
You neeed to make an otter pops lore episode😂😂❤
So why doesn't grape taste like grape?
Why not use Blueberry?
Who else after watching this wants to try all those blue candies again?
The most wild thing is that the blue ones are the best
Blue Ras is my favorite non-chocolate candy flavor.
Have you ever had concord grapes, @TheFoodTheorists??? That's the type of grape that grape tastes like.
BLUEBERRIES ARE F@#$%^& PURPLE
Hey matpat. I have a request. I love all of your channels.But I want to even watch about technology so can you please make a channel called "Tech theory" channel which tells us about technology like phones and aeroplanes and new tech. I hope you reach it so I am commenting the latest vedio of game theory ,style theory,gtlive,food theory and film theory
Your my favrote youtuber I wish I could meet you
10:40
My theory is that blue raspberry is just blueberries and Rasberries because where does the name blue raspberry come from? the only fruit that has the word blue in it is blueberries, so adding blueberries with raspberries equals basically blue raspberries or at least the flavor.
@Foodtheory, i would like you create a theory about the trending lettuce with hot water will make you sleep :)  GodSpeed theorist!
0:50 was sooo funny
Blue raspberry is my most favourite flavour
MatPats videos teach me more then school does.       And my parents wonder why i watch him so much.
Blueberry? Bubblegum?
Blue raspberry is one of those quintessentially USAmerican things, the rest of the world usually has even less of a clue what it's supposed to be. Thanks for the explanations! (Also *good* grapes taste of grape!)
Otter pops theory: 2026
Hey Mat, can you do a video about air up?
As a blueberry fanatic this is the video that was made for me
Hey mat i have news for you the flavour blue razz is actually just blueberry and raspberry mixed flavour so yeah its not as complicated as you made it if you used pink lemonade as a whats the flavor
Food theory Idea Matpat : does diet and exercise actually help with obesity? (This question has been killing me!!!)
I always refused to eat blue raspberry because it wasn’t real
wait ive never for the life of me seeing these videos ever seen the Cat girl (person with Cat ears who slaps Dan in this video) who is that? ive never seen that character before. did they recently get a new member of the crew?
Even blindfolded I can pick out the blue flavour. What flavour is it? It's blue! What does it taste like? Blue! Blue coloured food, except for blue M&Ms that taste like M&Ms, taste blue. It's a unique flavour.
Wait how about the flavour is blue berries because i tasted jolly ranchers that tasted like it
That opening sequence feels like that is exactly what the Theory office is like on a day to day basis
"grape"according to artificial flavouring tastes like blackberry
Blueberry boom
Gives a new spin on smarties slogan
Sour Patch Kids and Mike and Ike use something called Blue 1
Make otter  pop lore we need it now  do it or I will first you
This channel has turned from food theory into food fact first with Grubhub then with blue spruce then with prime then with medival food and then with spices and spicy food  then with Pepsi and coka cola   and now here with blue raspberry!!!
Who cares lancerious
I thought it was generally known knowledge that blue raspberry used to be just raspberry but the dyes they used caused cancer and they changed it to blue
I always thought it was a combination of blueberry & raspberry
B L U E
i love blue raspberry blue raspberry is true
I can’t be the only one who hates ‘blue raspberry’ flavoured stuff? I’m a strawberry person
You absolutely must do an Otter Pop lore theory now
Dude it isnt an ice cream or something its walters blue!
you should do a “is the 5 second rule true?” video
Finally, I always knew blu raz never existed, so I have always wondered what the heck am I devouring? At the same time I didn’t care cuz it just tasted so good. But good to know it’s safe to eat now
Blue is a flavor and it is the good flavor
Can’t believe you have nugget
that otterpop bit hit close to home
i was gonna comment on how i never really questioned what blue raspberry is, but, why is the ice on the shave ice so thick, its supposed to be shaved, thats the point of the name. Even with the name you call it, "snow cones" it's supposed to have the texture of snow. Do better.
I always thought it was blueberry and raspberry but just with a shortened name
Who knew to keep Matpat away from the FNaF lore it just had to be “The Blue Man” instead of “Purple Guy”
4:08 actually grape flavored things do taste like grape specifically the Concord grape
how long you can last in a super market  next hyper market
Blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue
Any Percy Jackson fans in the chat???🔱🔱🔱
Thank you for reciting the same info for 7 minutes. Really reminds me of why I stop watching your content.
Is that a pan flag for his snow cone XD
Oh I finally know what blue raspberry tastes like! How delightful
Fun fact! Poison dart frogs are not poisonous in captivity. They’re poisonous due to their diet, so if you breed one in captivity or take one from the wild they won’t create poison ever or they’ll lose their poison
Cool Blue and blue sour pach taste like noting
Blooooooooo
I really enjoy mixology, but i cannot legally use alcohol yet. I want more theories about mixology, alcohol, and beverages in general. I think a fun test would be giving one group real alcohol but telling them their is none, and giving a different group non-alcoholic drinks but saying there is alcohol. It would be a great way to talk about placebos, and how they can sometimes fail as a control.
The blue raspberry not being real is like when they revealed reznov was dead the whole time in bo1
8:33 so Amouranth is named after that industrial coloring?
blue
The raspberries don't taste like raspberries, the grape doesn't taste like grape, the banana doesn't taste like banana... next you'll be telling me the snozzberries don't taste like snozzberries!
As a big fan of blue raspberry flavored candy, I always just say it’s citrus flavored.
Before I watched this video I already knew about this
Hey Dan, can I get some of that B L U E
Ngl blue raspberry is my favorite flavor
Gotta be truthful here. This is the first time I have ever realized what the heck an "Otter Pop" is.  *Hears the gasps of incredulity*  Hey. HEY! I grew up close to the US-Mexican border! I knew "bolis" and "raspados", and they were delicious! FIGHT ME!
MatPat: "What is the flavor of BLUE?"  Me: "Imagination~."
Any Percy Jackson fans out there?
Hi
matt could you do a theory on if warm milk and cookies actually helps you sleep, why, and why people started saying that
blue
💙🔵🟦🔹Blue🔹🔵🟦💙
Blue flavor is a completely acceptable answer
When I think of Blue Raspberry, I think of Blueberry-Raspberry. I hate the flavor of natural blueberries. The only blueberry I like is when it's sweet and in a pie. When I think of the taste of Blue Raspberry, I associate it with blueberry mixed with raspberry. Raspberries aren't sweet, either, so it's a whole flavor profile of yuck for me.
blue
Otter pops slap
3:25 I was just sitting behind my computer screaming BLUEBERRY!
Me and my dad were having a discuss about this like 5 minutes ago and then this video pops up on my homepage
Head editor dan is my spirit animal😂
PLEASE give us Otter Pop Lore, we need it
Aren't all colors reflected light?
ITS SO OVIOUS
Bryan can’t eat blue
Blue raspberry is a real plant but it originally was made in a lab but they can be found in Florida I was actually at a farm and they are a mix of the color of a blubbery and the taste and shape of a resbery it was so good
Blue flavour
Great theory! It reminds me that I once heard that the artificial "banana" flavoring doesn't taste like real bananas... because actual bananas have changed flavor since they created the artificial "banana" flavor
Pink lemonade would be an interesting topic to cover
"licking Ariel" 4:32
Matpat can you talk about the Pusheen the cat drink I'm busy it has over 86% of sugar than other sodas that have about 66% sugar please talk about this.
0:04 is that a bryan regan reference??
after the intro part i caught a glimpse of plankton from spongebob squarepants stealing the krabby patty recipe.  this means you have to make a video on film theory explaining the spongebob squarepants lore.
4:10
blue flavoor
Green is better
DID NOBODY KNOW THAT BLUE RASPBERRIES WERENT A REal THING 💀 💀 💀
Matthew should fly all the way to the west coast just to get In n’ Out for a theory
I really love 🟦 my favorite 😁
I really want to see the otter pops episode
Fun fact: Strawberries don't *Actually* have a flavor
You've done fries, you've done soda, you've done pizza, and you've even done chicken sandwiches, but now you gotta do the one we really want, the grand drive thru-daddy, the go-to for fast food, the one and only, BURGER!
Please do an otter pop lore video
Actually I think that blue raspberry is raspberry and blueberry combined
I looked it up and it's actually not real good job
Why does pineapple flavored candy always taste like pineapple
I knew it!
Ahem....blueberries aren't blueee
blue
Before I even watched the video, I Had A Broken Heart. Blue raspberry is my absolute favorite flavor out of all candies I Eat. Seeing the title and the thumbnail already broke my heart. I don’t even know if I can watch this video. 😢
Is Blue  Being asked what blue flavored things has to be one of the most reality bending things I’ve been asked because I don’t have a answer like I can’t remember or know I’ve never thought about it
Almost every flavoring is a lie today
6:56 yes you do.  Make it now or be a Disappointment❤      I say that with love because there’s no way your not a teachers pet people pleaser type😂❤
6:11 DO NOT INSULT MY FAVORITE KIND OF POPSICLE LIKE THAT, I WILL PHYSICALLY FIGHT YOU.
WE NEED OTTER POP LORE
As a guy who ate a “blue raspberry” sour patch kid, I can confirm that it tastes like b l u e
otter pop theory is prime April fools content
your life, MatPat is a Theory, a FOOD ,STILE, FILM, AND GAME THEORY!
Lean flavor?
MatPat: “What Even Is My Life Anymore” Me: Idk
0:42 B L U E
Matpat: What is my life? Me: a theory, a life theory, thanks for watching
Blueberry
Oh no! Blue raspberry used to be my favourite flavour
Fun fact about otter pops, if you don’t have scissors, then you can rip/break the pop in half and it’s actually it’s own life hack 😊
grape flavor does taste like grapes, just not normal ones. for anyone reading try grapes of the "Isabella" variety. They taste EXACTLY like the artificial flavor.
Neat, next idea should be"Why lemon and lime?" Because I dont know about others, vut my prefered xandies come in lemon and/or lime flavors. This also recently includes yellow gatorade sprite and the new "Starry" soda from pepsico. And im sure other people dont enjoy the fruits by themselves, so why do a ton of things flavor with the two citri(?)
After this a ate soem bluerazberry gummy
Blue Raspberry? That's just an American thing, isn't it?  PS: A blue raspberry? Isn't that just a blackberry? They're not raspberries, but like, they exist, and have their own distinct taste, while looking very similar to raspberries, but very dark blue. Blackberries are nice, we need them in more things.
in europe we just use blueberry instead
Mat. Help! I was in an argument over which is better ; Glass coke, Plastic Coke or canned coke. I am glass coke and plastic is down right awful. Plz Plz Plz
blue.
Matpat got some real work to do with amanda the adventurer
*b l u e*
I LOVE blue raspberry~ But I've found my favorite food color to eat is actually orange, which honestly makes sense since it's basically the color of carbs lol.
Huh, wow, this was very interesting, i wonder what other lies we’ve been told?
no way thx this is so helpful
Blue
I love blue/green color drinks as a kid and a adult
Nothing better than drinking some blue raspberry juice and eating chips covered in red 40

I have a theory as style theory or skin-tight suit really good for superheroes?
Now we need to know the favor of bubblegum 👁️👁️
Blue?.
Blackberry: hold, my stem

Yes you do have to make an otter pop lore theory video.
Before I finish watching this video. I'm gonna putt my guessing that blue raspberries a mixture of blueberry and raspberry
I'm having a blue jolly rancher
Whenever I saw blue raspberry at a store I never thought of it as blue raspberry. I always thought of it as sour blue
blue
"Now we know what licking Ariel would taste like" ew! which part are you licking in this case!? Her tail or her torso?😂  Also even though blue raspberry is fake, it's still good at making you think it's actually raspberry because of the tartness
0:03 mar par has a chad 🇹🇩 snow cone
otterpop Lore? yes, just yes LMAO XD
So you're talkin about the fake blue raspberry thing right is the same thing for prime the energy drink and hydration drink? 👁️👄👁️
Most of the organisms that are blue actually achieve the color through microscopic structures that bounce light around in all kinds of funny ways. In nature, actual blue pigment is far rarer than the color blue!
I legit thought it was blue berry with raspberry 😳
otter pop lore would be fun
im not american so i dont have to watch this video
Any one just: "**Realized blue raspberry ist a fuit**"
blue
I’ve always hated the flavor of artificial grape 😒.
Blueberry?
MatPat: Talks about ridiculous pudding flavors. "Now we know what licking Ariel tastes like. I mean, I would have would have assumed it was something closer to the saltiness of the ocean and not the cloying sweetness of this. But sure, all of this is fiction anyway." Me: "BRUH!!!!!!!! TELL THAT TO THE THEORIES YOU MADE OF HOW LONG LUIGI'S D*CK IS!!!!!"  Literally 3 mins and 13 seconds later...  MatPat: "Is there Otter Pop lore that I have to be aware of here? Do I have to do an Otter Pop lore theory?!" Me: "WTF???????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU LITERALLY BASHED YOURSELF AND YOUR PAST STUPID THEORIES LIKE *THIS* NOT EVEN 5 MIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNUUUUUUUUUUUTTTESSSSS AGOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Grape DOES taste like wild grapes. Go to northeastern USA and find some ripe wild grapes. They taste just like artificial grape flavor.
How does this video go from blue being the most dangerous color by nature to the safest color to consume by the fda lol
Blue

@9:32  editor missed the chance to have Melvin say “I am Groote”
I always assumed blue raspberry was a mix of raspberry and blue berry
Blue👍

Cool blue is blueberry
I liked the original red respberry flavour before they switched to blue for dairy queen slushies
Mountain dew is actually an orange pop but colored green yellow you dont even know,  check the ingredients it actually has orange juice in it.
4:30 no waaaay he said that.
Blueberries duh
As a blue enjoyer since day 1, i can confirm that blue is the best ice cream flavor.
i think they meant blueberry
This might explain why I like cherries but not charley flavored things and vise versa with watermelon, it’s because the flavors aren’t real it’s just marketing.
My life is a lie I loved blue raspberry  flavored candy
matt talking about tasting Ariel and saltiness of the ocean caught me off guard...
Blue raspberry is my favorite flavor
Well that sucks
Blue flavored things are my favorite. Except for those *points to a blue colored candy that actually tastes like grapes* why why must you trick me grape nasty😫😫

Now we are all waiting on an otter pop lore theory. You’ve doomed yourself matpat
But I love that “flavor”, blue raspberry!
YESSSS SOMEONE WHO LIKES GRAPE "FLAVORED" THINGS
blue
*blue berry has left the chat*
In my back yard my family gather hundreds of those dark raspberries, as in the rate that can be mass produced, so I am pretty sure those raspberries can be mass produced.
where i live we always call blue candy blueberry
Best. Cold open.  Also, does matt sound more agitated than usual? You good matt?
Wait.. people thought blue razz berries were REAL??
Blue
It’s not even a theory, it’s well known as a fake flavour.

He got the blue flavor man
“Now we know what licking Ariel tastes like” 💀
I’m wondering why it’s not called blueberry flavor
Best opening gag so far
otter pop lore, yes please
Blue Raspberries might not be real, but their corresponding candy and beverage flavors are near unbeatable.
The animation at the beginning was so funny.😂 🔵
Matt... BLUEBERRIES ARE PURPLE. That might be why they don't represent blue, because they are PURPLE
Otterpop lore please
You should make a theory about you

U MUST DO OTTER POP LORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(PLEASE)
In my country there was a candy called "dipper" it was a really big trend. It had lots of flavours example: raspberry, strawberry, apple and alot of other flavours. And with each flavour came a diffrent colour. And turns out that the flavour "blue rasperry" which was blue(ofc) had a chemical that caused vomiting headache and other stuff like that. Weird huh?
blue berrys with rasperry or smth like that

BLUEBERRIES ARE PURPLE!!!!!
Eww grape is nasty
Just paint a raspberry blue
blue.
But blueberries are blue and aren't deadly (at least I still live despite eating them often). I guess it's a rather dark, slightly blackish blue but still blue enough.
I'm disappointed matpat, the water is actually blue, it's not just a refraction thing
Don't know if it's been done but on food theory would be cool to see drive through vs going inside :)
Intro is gass
blue berry stuff is yummy                                        93Klikes
Half of us already know that the real flavor is blueberry. Case closed
I’m Australia we have purple sour patch kids not blue
Matt got Rmanian flavor
my guess is raspberry with blueberry
Absolutely agree, France is blue in EU4
matzot do a thereon why people say no dip
Personally my favourite Gatorade flavor is lime cucumber (I love cucumbers) :)

Not matpat having an existential crisis over otter pops. 😂
BLUE
I always thought it was just blackberry.
i love guzzling red# 2 *slurp*
It’s blueberry! And just eat your snowcone!
POV: you never seen a blue raspberry bush 💀
Raspberry it’s my favorite food and they just died raspberry things into blue in the most famous soccer in the world is blue raspberry.
I knew the day I first saw “blue raspberry” on a drink, I knew that there was no such thing, and that’s also the reason why I never tried it.
Grape flavored candies never taste like grapes
The L-Picece in Tetris is blue!
These intro are getting more and more insane and I absolutely love it 😂
My whole life has been a lie
flavour of blue is chemical
Blue razz is my fav vape flavorrrrrr
My friend from America just sent me sour patch kids in blue raspberry. perfect video!
I saw on a minute maid bottle that they made blue raspberry with pear juice and blue food dye.
A Blueberry is not poisonous.
Order pop law plz I and we NEED IT !!!!!!!
I like Blue Raspberry flavor.
Actually grapes flavors are made after Concord grapes which is what your jelly is made of and your grape juices.
0:03 - 0:20 representing the pan boisss :o

Otter-pops - grab each end, bend in half. Now you’ve got two (opened) Otter-pops.
Very off topic to the video but something about MatPat's voice makes my dog behave and relax 😅
Actually I found this out years ago when I was bored and had a conversation with my dad about candy and the flavor blue raspberry and how it’s a lie
BBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLUUUUUUUUEEEEEEEEEEEE
doesn't blue number 2 cause brain cancer?
Him : what flavor is blue? Me : BLUEBERRY him :blue raspberry uhm
The berry (Rubus caesius) is called blue raspberry in direct translation from Swedish and it is also as blue as blueberries. They grow wild where I live on Gotland, but here they are called (salmbär).
game theory idea Minecrafts hidden cannibalism
blue......blu.........yum......blu!
Otter pop lore theory!!
As a Brit, I am personally offended that you had purple be grape and not blackcurrant, and further distraught that you had  Tom say he loved it. PS-this is a joke, fun opening gag. Blue            Blue
he forgot blue raspberry prime
grape doesn't taste like grape - unless you eat grapes in Japan. They are pretty awful tasting  and have unpleasantly thick skins, but they taste just like that flavour of soft-drink that inexplicably continues to exist.
og CHOP FRUIT
It tastes like blue
Everything tastes better when its blue
Grape is the superior flavor, idc what anyone says. Yes i know it doesn't taste like grapes.
We have raspberry as pink and strawberry as red and like a dark purply red for cherry. And no grape
Wouldn't it be cool if game theorists actually tried to make a video where they made blue a flavour 🔵🔹
4:05 BLUEBERRIES ARE FUCKING PURPLE
blue raspberry is normal berries but spray painted blue

You just died to Kool-Aid
My love for anything grape flavor died in the doctor's office. If I want grape flavor, I eat actual grapes. My favorite flavor is actually a combination: dark chocolate mint.
i eat normal sourpatch kids like a champ
Do murder drones plenty of loooooooorrrrrreeeeeeee
Matpat's will go insane after he finds out that red is a name of a flavor just the word red. There is a soda that's flavored red in my area. 😂
I sure do hope somebody genetically modifies raspberries to be blue one day...
is the fact that blue raspberry is not a real thing a shock to Americans?
IS blue raspberry even a thing??
now do one on pink lemonade
Maybe it's blueberries
Cool blue Gatorade tastes like mandarin oranges. Specifically canned ones
@3:25 my friend steve used to tell me blue raspberry flavor is extracted from beaver butthole. he always swore to me cause i thought he was pulling my leg. i hope he's wrong but i stopped eating any blue flavor after he told me that...
"and now we know what ariel tastes like"    {8(
One-piece fans will love this. The "Devil Fruit"
I always thought they made blue raspberry because they needed an extreme blue flavor. Blueberry exists, but it's a very passive flavor, same with banana. That's why lemon is so popular. They had plenty of reds, so they needed a blue counterpart. Smart move. Blue is often my favorite flavor. The blue raspberry jolly ranchers were always the first to go! :P
As someone that is allergic to blue dye i can’t relate
the flavor is blue
gonna have to stop you there mat, grape flavor is supposed to resemble concord grapes, try some, they are quite good.
I'm thinking you could genetically engineer a  blueberry and raspberry combo
actually, the grape flavour tastes like the way grapes naturally taste in japan so no, grape flavour  actually does taste like grapes, however it was based of what grapes tasted like in the area the artificial flavour originated from.
Not to sound like a pedant but artificial grape flavor is supposed to taste like concord grapes.🍇
You need to make an otter pop lore video.
Plz make a theory about Soylent and Nutrishakes “having all the essential vitamins and nutrients you need for the day” along with going over what our bodies need to live to see if those diets supplements are effective or not at helping people get their daily intakes. Also how to make your own liquid meal on the go with everything you need so you don’t have to stop and eat a full course meal during the day
I loved this video, but do you think you could make one on the flavour of bubble gum, because when I got a packet of gum I checked the flavour and it said BUBBLEGUM! I mean what even is bubble gum?😂😂😕
matpat's snow cones is the pansexual flag
im watching the spongebob movie : spounge out of water and i realist some thing humans are eating the craby paddy
It's not blue raspberry it's blueberry
Blue Berrys are PURPLE not blue I’ll fight anyone
Blue bubblegum w/ condensed milk and stuffed w/ vanilla ice cream from Brooke’s is my preferred flavor of snowballs
Mat i hate to brrak it to you but Blueberrys arent actually blue they are Purple
It's raspberry and lemonade and sugar
More importantly what on gods green earth is Banana flavor?
blackberry?
I’d like an otter pop lore video please.
No I LOVE grape and it gets hated on so much for “tasting like medicine” WHEN MOST OF THE TIME IT DOESNT 😢😢😢
Blue.

Who actually thought blue raspberry was a real thing?
It’s just windshield wiper fluid.

Otter pop theory is a go
Thats why people love Nyquil chicken
the blue jolly ranchers are so good
I hated blue razzbery enyway
Sorry typo I meant to say therey
Other pop Belong in food siri
couldve made this video about what "grape" flavor is, considering how grape flavor tastes nothing like real grapes in any remote way yet always tastes like other grape flavorings.  almost like its more just the flavor of the color purple itself, like its the flavororal archetype that we innately give to purple for some reason based on how we regard purple's character relative to the other colors
I thought it was common sen-
Did anyone else notice the pan colored snow cone in the first bit? might be a coincidence, but I think not.
Not MatPat saying that grape flavor doesn’t taste like grapes, completely ignoring the existence of Concord grapes
Blue.
It’s just raspberry but colored  blue that’s it
Potato😢
11:39 I will answer this question again ThE FaVoR iS bLuE
Certified blue man group appreciation video 😊

3:18 the favor is blue
It's blueberry
mat: ''what should i get for lunch?'' dan:"𝐛𝐥𝐮𝐞''
please do a otter pop video.
I mean yellow is a cake flavor so blue being a flavor makes sense.
Do an episode on Otter pop lore!
As a Mexican it's weird hearing people say snowcone instead of raspado..also my family refers to flavors as the color so cherry=red, blue raspberry=blue and so on, meaning Dan was correct, he had blue
When it comes to gatorade I actually prefer orange
If DeGroot keeps inventing all this stuff Medival Mode is gonna change a lot lmaooo TF2 Homies drop a like
1:31 excuse me??? what about purple???             also this video is full of percy jackson food
Otter pop lore video plz!
Shut up shut up SHUT UP!
I subscribed to all 5 channels even fashion theriost
Grape flavor doesn't taste like table grapes, true. But it does taste like concord grapes!
We require the Otter Pop lore.
My face when grape flavored stuff tastes like grapes, just not the popular table grapes but instead concord grapes
I just assumed it was because they didn’t want to make another flavour and just had 2 raspberry’s
Hi Mr. Pat! My daughter and I love watching your Food Theory Breakdowns. We just finished this one and she said she would love for you to do a video on the lore behind Candyland. I know you love you some lore videos, so maybe this could be a good one to research. Thanks for the great content. We love you!
I hate blue raspberry. Ite everywhere
I like blue favor
blue is the most edible colour my mind cannot be changed
He's going insane, guys...
bro really said "licking arial" BRO
I dont care if its not a "real flavor" its the goddamn best flavor to exist, even if its "not real" its still amazing
After the prime videos, I’m interested in you guys doing protein shakes for weight loss & weight gain. I know every body is different, but how you got down to the bottom of the drinks ingredients to find out what your body truly needs was beyond intriguing to me and I wonder about all drinks now 😅. Great work Mat!
Fun fact.. most food coloring is hazardous to our health especially the colors blue and red
Blue in fact is a flavor. It has been tested multiple times right along with the flavor green. Why the colors green and blue have a flavor despite not naturally being flavors I have no freaking clue though.😅
United States of America:  Icee's!  Otterpops!   Canada: (Clearly the superior one) Slushies! Freezies!
Have to make this joke: blue-pilled
Uh but is there not a blue candy flavor called bubble gum ever heard of that mat pat!!?? Hhhhmmmmmm!?
“Now we know what licking Ariel tastes like” -Marty Patty, 2023
this video make me want to go get blue raspberry energy drink

Waiting on MatPat to release the episode on seed oils.
Blueberries aren't actually blue, but deep purple-
Look the only reason like kids really like blue Gatorade is because they play too much fortnight and it looks like the chug chug
it tastes like blue barries
11:21 … in fact people can make hotdog flavored frosting. Gross

to quote Randy Feltface; BLUE BERRIES ARE FUCKING PURPLE
I like grape like matpat as well, people that group medicine and grape together generally don't like grape, but i have a really good immune system so I've almost never taken medicine and I still like grape.
I wonder what licking a mermaid tastes llike😂
Mmmm.....I love Blue flavore😃
What about blueberry’s Matt?
“If the human’s sense of taste is so easy to control and manipulate” then why not use today’s sponsor air up. (10:40) I genuinely thought that was what he was gonna say coz I’ve seen too many of that sponsor on this channel. It’s repeating in my head and won’t stop Send help 0-0
Licking Ariel!!! I fucking died!!! 🤣🤣
6:13 are you spying on me??
Blue.
It’s like meta moon prime. You don’t know what it tastes like so you want to buy it to try it. Also the dreamworld coca cola flavor
MatPat thanks for saying my name!!!
6:48 Yes? Yes!
BLUE FLAVOR
I have a great vid idea, which apple makes the best apple juice, or which apple make the best pie.
12:45 fin.
Me and a couple of friends actually looked this up the other day. What a coincidence.
blue.
Dan is correct.
Surprised a theory about this topic wasn't released until now
Nominate this intro skit for an Oscar
blue.
Some on could mate blueberries and raspberries to create a hybrid
Um.....cool blue is Souris but sweet on hot days and the blue thing on the left I bet is sour,sweet but evil?
Break the otter pops in the middle fyi
Blu
I knew it!!!! Never trusted raspberry
4:00 No Blueberries are Purple!
Blue…
The color of blue is: sugar flavored.
You didn’t know it was fake
Well I am glad it is not deadly at least... as a kid I used to see how many squirts of Blue Raspberry I could tolerate when making a slush puppy... I think I topped off at 10 when my poop was turning blue.
The person the editor Dan had a blueberry
OMG ty matpat!! I'm allergic to Raspberries but can eat anything "blue raspberry" flavored, even if it has natural juices. I FINALLY GET WHY!
grape flavour tastes like concord grapes. try one its crazy
Me finding this after getting blue raspberry prime 😅
Blueberries aren't blue.
blue raspberries are real and you are fiction
this video smells so bad!
Please do otter pop lore!
I know Blue Raspberrys are not a thing.
Diet Coke be going hard
Can't wait to go to the store, buy pudding, and *l i c k   A r i e l*.
Zooper Doopers did a chad move and made raspberry pink and blue flavour is just bubblegum.
does it seem like sometimes matpat may have like a kind of arg or whatever it's called?
i will always be upset with companies that ditched lime and turned to green apple
Dont let them know your next move: It tastes like sugar
No one: Me: eating red and blue slime lickers while watching a video of how fake they are
Quote from edditor dan:  ........ Blue
I can images mat pat makes videos about food with lore
Blueberry raspberry
Idk why. Bllue raspberry is a horrible flavor...
theory idea (this will not be in a video unless im the luckiest person on earth): is the time-stopping in jojos bizzare adventure actually possible, even if it was not possible for a human but could happen. this would be a film theory and would love if this was an episode.
Can we also talk about how banana flavouring comes from an extinct breed of bananas? That’s why the artificial flavour tasted so different to the real thing
man I like how this horrible capitalism flavour isn't a thing here nor are the different flavours being colors, lol
Plot Twist: It was a blackcurrant
Yes do that otter-pop lore
How about bubblegum next? There isn't even a widely known fruit associated with it.
YOU HAVE TO DO THE OTTER POP THEORY!!!
BLUEBERRY IS PURPLE
Blue.
i will always choose grape,blue raspberry and coke a cola
I can't imagine mattpat in a lab coat making esters to determine fruit flavours.
GRAPE IS THE BEST FLAVOR BOY
*wait till mattpat finds out how artificial strawberry flavourings are made*
What I’ve found with companies that have both flavours, usually raspberry tastes, like… well… raspberry, and BLUE raspberry tastes, kind of like raspberry lemonade?
Blue raspberry has always been my absolute favorite flavor of anything because of how great it tastes and I was really disappointed when I found out the fruit doesn’t exist. I still love normal raspberries though
I would click so fast on an Otterpops lore video
TONY I SWEAR TO GOD
En México tenemos moras, siempre asumí que azul era mora y sí existen
Lol, why has it taken me until now to notice that in your intro its Kevin and his famous chili right before the kitchen in your intro.
I have never seen a chibi animation look so close to committing murder. 😆
blueeeeeee....
blue raspberry = methlamfetamine
I don't need a 13 minute long video to know that but here I am. 🧚🧚🧚
I’m gonna actually cry, as someone who proudly proclaims that grape is their favourite artificial flavour
I always knew it wasn’t a real thing but I always wondered what made the flavor “Blue” raspberry.
Guy who thought blue raspberry was a thing: blue raspberry was never real? Truth: always was.
BLUEBERRY 🫐
How about covering the problem with the flavor of bananas, Matt?
Food theory ideea: you are doing you dishes wrong. Should you wash them before you eat? 🤔
I can’t believe he ignored the fact that there are 12 million penguins in Antarctica, and there are 36,686 people in Monaco, so if the penguins of Antarctica decided to invade Monaco, each person would have to fight over 300 penguins.
Green apple is my favorite Sour Patch kid
Never thought amouranth would be in a good theory video. Interesting
Blue raspberry is literally blue berry and raspberry spliced obviously
I'm just whating this whith a rubix cube on shoulder 😂what am I doing with my life
I feel like snack companies just guess on how something tastes. Like artificial grape tastes NOTHING like actual grape, same with artificial banana.
The biggest trick of my childhood was buying a blue two stick popsicle. Thinking it was blue berries but instead. It was pink Bubble gum flavor. Or Cotton candy flavor. Ugh! I hated that and wasted money think it wasn't a bgig flavor change. I was wrong...  Still looking for that pure blue color cream that basken robins sold. It was the perfect blue flavor...
I love blue raspberry, and always kind of assumed it was raspberry flavouring with a blue dye.
I got purple fashion with flavour of games 4:23
Mattpat how did you know I said blue m&ms taste like chocolate that scares me
The colors of matpat’s snow cone is the pan sexual pride flag anyone else notice
I love how his videos are no longer theories but actual facts
Banana, cherry and pineapple
We could genetically modify raspberries to produce real life blue raspberries
Give us the otter pop lore
In the future we will have real blue raspberries
Dan broke matpat
Why did you harsh so much on grape the whole episode if you actually like it???
The actual content starts at the 5 minute mark. Everything before that is fluff.
Matt doesn't know what grapes taste like.
BLUE BEST FLAVOR
blue
Grape flavor does taste like grapes, just not table grapes. They are flavored like concord grapes
Blue here is US-only, at least regarding raspberry. When blue colouring is used here at all, it's bluberry or raspberry.
How’d you get worse
Fun fact. The syrup brand Torani has blue raz and red raz, but they taste identical.
See I was the person who saw it blue raspberry was taking blueberries and raspberries and put them together but no someone had to overcomplicate it 🫥
F in the chat for the little-known blueberry-flavored Dum Dum sucker that is my second favorite.
Can't wait for the otter pops lore video
Blue Raspberry = Blackberry
Did u know Thomas eddison didn't actually invent the light bulb?               I watch too much big bang theoryb :>
Diet coke is good Diet coke is great
Most "blue" animals don't acctualy use blue pigments. It's quete interesting, but I don't have the IQ to say it
limitations = creativity, the less I have the better
my favorite part in the whole video is when he says “raspberry”
This thing is so American I can't relate to it in any way. We in Europe associate blue sweets with actually blue berries.
this was interesting and i appreciate your efforts but can you please be less annoying
Red. Is. Sus.
And your editor killed himself
this feels like it was made in 2010
Blue razzberry is my favorite flavor fr
So, Funny story, Jolly Rancher actually uses real Fruit juice in their Blue Raspberry chews. I am allergic to real Raspberry and a friend of mine thinking she would test the theory, unwrapped a candy and handed it to me. So I thinking nothing of it, ate the candy, and broke out in welts. I Love Raspberry so I really enjoyed it, but I had to Benadryl up afterward.
grape tastes like purple
What’s next, MatPat, rainbow flavor is a lie? 😂
Otter pops
I'm a supertaster and blue raspberry has always been grape lemon in my mind. I'm surprised that cherry is among the flavor profile, because I am allergic to most cherry-flavored things but I've never gotten mouth sweats from blue raspberry
Blue raspberry is a flavor
I'd don't care its a lie. Its delicious.
i always thought blue razzberry was blueberry and razzberry combo
Citric acid. It's always citric acid.
I mean, this is pretty interesting but it’s still my favourite slushie flavour
I love actual grapes but can't stand grape flavouring! Blue Gatorade is best!
So it’s 4 flavors in a trench coat
Otterpop theory pls
wow
Blue raspberry is blueberry raspberry
Licking Ariel? Lewd.
Make way for captain fucking obvious
The grape slander in this video, OML
Orange.
The flavor of blue is blueberry  *puts on shades, walks out stylishly*
Idk why but I call blue raspberry, Electric Berry instead.
Thank you for making this video, I have been wondering for ages!
Please refer to Randy Feltface’s views on blue foods and you’ll know why I’ll never see blueberries as “blue” again
Second video of asking matpat to play Rain world
I thought blue was blueberry instead of blue rashberry
I DONT CARE THAT ITS NOT REAL
'now we know what licking ariel taste like" -HOLD UP
As a european, i was always wondering why is america so obsessed with something that literally doesnt exist
Fun fact blueberries aren’t actually blue their just a dark shade of purple
I have always questioned myself on why Grape flavor never tastes like grape, i really hope he makes a video on it😭
Blue.
Blue sounds good to me am I right or am i right guys?
Blue Raspberry is still my favorite and no one can take it away from me!
I have never had a snow cone before 😭
Ok but a 5 minute intro is wild
thank god i hate candy lol🤣
"i'm blue da bu de da you die" 😂
1:15 i have a sort of impression of 'deja vu' with that tongue
I refuse to believe cool blue Gatorade sells better than fruit punch
Umm ur all stupid as all the flavors are fake. Its food coloring and corn syrup. They also add stuff like citrus flavoring to make you think its strawberry or grape etc.
Funnily enough the butterfly he shows in the beginning doesn't actually contain any blue pigments. Super fine structures in the wing filter out certain wavelengths of light. If that butterfly gets wet it turns kinda brown, like a moth.
I always figured it was a combination of cherry and blueberry.😅
I’ve been wondering this for a while, and as someone who does not understand the blue raspberry obsession, this is kind of vindicating  Honestly tho, most artificial colors and flavorings don’t do much for me whether they taste remotely like what they’re supposed to or not, and they usually don’t btw, grape not tasting like grape is just the beginning; strawberry doesn’t taste like strawberry, watermelon doesn’t taste like watermelon, green apple tastes like sour with a little bit of sweet mixed in, I can’t attest to cherry cuz I don’t like or eat real cherries and I usually do not like the cherry flavored things either  Now, I will say that I love gummy bears and worms and Glacier Freeze Gatorade (the light blue, but I also like Cool Blue), not bc they taste like anything in particular, I just like the flavors, but I generally am not big on fruity candies a d default to chocolate (and yeah, I know most of the chocolate on the market isn’t ‘real chocolate’ either bc I saw that theory too, but idc just let me be a basic bluepilled McDonald’s and Pepsi shill plz thx)
I thought that it would be blueberry
blue
I think cool blue tastes like mandarin oranges
blue raspberry doesnt exist it cant hurt you
i always considered blue candy as blueberry
Is it true taco Bell makes the toilet hate you
commenting before watching. had a coworker whose wife was a food scientist and helped create flavors for brands. X company/fast food place is doing a collab with sour patch? she's making that slushie or canned pre-work out drink. I drunkenly asked her to explain blue raspberry at a company xmas party but was too blitzed to remember the next day. Regret it because it was the most concise, satisfying answer. Hopefully this scratches the itch cause wikipedia is kinda weak.  It was neat getting unmarked cans of rejected recipes though.
Grape is legit just a flavor that was made in the lab somewhere, idk where. I haven't looked that stuff up cause I haven't gotten that interested in it, but I do remember watching this one guy make the grape flavor out of a glove- so I am so curious on what grape really is for a flavor
There should be a candy theory
i thought blue razz was blueberry raspberry😭
So There are two kinds of blueberrys that, at least i find. There are bush blueberrys, and wild blueberrys( those are staight translates from Finnish, so sorru if they are wrong😂) In my opinnion bush blueberrys, taste horrible. But yhe wild blueberrys are so delicious.
Its    Mulveber😂😂😂😂
I Googled it and it is true 4:56

New food theory for you: why is chicken noodles soup for when you're sick? And does it actually help?
Thank you for answering this. This always bugged me as a kid. I always wondered why they went with blue and raspberry and now I know
I really love the editing in this video and the little animations.
Blue  Raspberry is real🫐➕🍇
Blue berry
The back of my brain every time Mattpatt calls blueberries blue  “BLUE BERRIES ARE FUCKING PURPLE”  Points to people who get that
“BLUE FLAVOR!” -Sody Pop
Ain't blue raspberry blueberry?
Let’s just say they made Blue raspberry the color they did because it’s aesthetically pleasing 💙💙
brayden can't have blue
You mentioned otter pop theory. . . . I want it!!!!!
I love the memes you put at the end of every video. Thanks for making me laugh 😊
Hello! Can you do a theory about bobs burgers burgers please?

Blueberry. Blue raspberry tastes like blueberries.
some blue flavers they do choose bluberry! i think they seen this vid
Matpat trying to gaslight us into thinking blackberries dont exist
i NEED otter pop lore video
The Gatorade part caught me so off guard, cause I’d never thought about it! Most of the other flavors have legit names but the two blues are Cool Blue and Frost Glacier Freeze.
do one ep on the banana flavor
*BLUE FLAVOR*
your life were your stuck in your theory's that"s your life
i once had a blue milkshake. i pooped green afterwards
Do the otter pop lore
my mind is fixed ty matpat!
Blueberry 🫐
If you thought it was real your dumb
Food theory video idea: test out foods and see if their slogan lives up to its expectation
what about blueberry yo
Who cares
LOOK MAT PAT You have things like PIES and poptarts that come with FLAVOURS BY THE NAME OF FRUIT but in Merica there are different extra flavours those flavours are called RED BLUE GREEN and anything under the rainbow. You don’t say lemonade pop sickle you say yellow pop sickle you don’t say Fruit Punch Gatorade you say RED Gatorade. And you Don’t SAY BlueRhasberry snow cone it’s BLUE SNOW CONE 😂😂😂😂
irony is that blue roses are also not natural. It's a rose that someone dyed blue in a way.  Would be an interesting thing to make a theory on if it fits any of the channels....
How about bill nye the gamer guy
Red in peace
I think you probably should do otter pop theroy video
YES! There has to be Otter Pop lore and I'd love to watch a video on it with my daughter! She loves you too ^_^
Aren’t they called Zoopa doopers
Well yea. It tastes like garbage
I can’t specify the amount of times I called “blue raspberry “ blue flavour
I remember when red M&Ms came back. It was so weird. Up to that point M&Ms were orange, yellow, green, brown and another color of brown. I also remember the vote for the blue M&M, too. I actually voted for the new M&M color (at the time I wanted purple to win, but now I see the error of my ways). Anyway, I remember the first time I ate a red M&M after hearing years of stories from my older relatives that the red dye was poisonous. I was rather tentative when I ate those first few red M&Ms, but when I didn't die I admitted that they made the M&Ms look prettier and I accepted the new color. However M&Ms didn't reach color perfection until they added blue and dropped 2nd brown.   As for blue razz, my husband and I both refer to it as blue because that's its flavor...it's just blue! We have also agreed that there's a red flavor because sometimes you can't figure out what the red flavor is. It's not quite cherry or strawberry or raspberry and it's not really fruit punch flavored. It's just red.
Pls make a otter pop Lore video
I put blueberries in the hole of a raspberry and eat them like that
Otter pop lore  👇
The answer to your question is yes, you need to do an Otter Pops lore video. Please and thank you.
Well duh
I got told blue raspberry was called that way because when you took the flavors out of the raspberry it was blue
I am now expecting an Otter Pop lore video
Blueberry
6:44 Lil Orphan Orange💀
Haven't watched the video yet but I just figured blue raspberry was dyed blue because so many fruit flavors are already red. Cherry, Strawberry, Apple (red or green). So I figure raspberry was dyed to separate it from other flavors.
for me blue rasp is just sweet and a bit sour
Yea, ‚Merica just a parody on the concept of Stupid itself..
That intro might be my favourite one of all xD  Blue
Is it not blue raspberry it's blueberry
i love u sour patch kinder👴
omg
Blue 😐
Huh... Must not be an international thing, I guess. Never heard of blue raspberries until recently
so blue raspberry is just . . . . . fruit punch?
... they've been watching chikn nuggit. They've been watching it for the lore. There is lore. Recently we learned from iscream and fwench fwy that chikn is a god.
Children don’t like blueberry’s so they changed the name to blue raspberry to make it more appealing
Grape tastes like grape. I have a grape vine in my back yard. It produces very small grapes but these grapes taste like grape flavoured candy/juices.  (though just a little bit more tart). I think these are potentially concord grapes. The tartness may have to do with the conditions it's growing under. Atlantic canada isn't exactly known as the best environment for grapes lol
blackberry
Makes sense that Blue #2 is the least dangerous. Have you seen your poop afterwards... That coloring does not break down in your body xD
Kinda funny, because the fruit flavors are different in Europe - Raspberry is usually red and cherry is a very niche flavor
the thing with "blue" is we have somethimg similar in Germany but we call it "Schlumpf-Eis" ( in english : "Smurf-Ice") and no one knows what flavor it accually is.
Blue
blue.
Blueberries arent actually blue. Theyre purple
I love blue raspberry. It was always my favorite of anything as a kid. It not only tastes the best but blue was my favorite color.
"Now we know what licking Ariel would taste like." This line made me burst laughing at 5 AM (i just have to say it, licking Ariel as the mermaid or the detergent)
Now that I think of it, there a quite a few common candy flavors that   just seem to be a vague arrangement of various flavors that is given a mysterious name.  To name a few: Bubblegum Fruit punch / Island Punch Tutti-Fruitti
Im allergic to fake blue m&m
Matpat did NOT just sneak in "lick Ariel" this casually in a video 💀💀💀

Blue raspberry minus- blue equals raspberry yay yummy but blue raspberry minus- raspberry equals blue?.
At the start of the video I paused to try and guess what the actual flavors would be and my guess was raspberry, cherry, and lemon, so I was kinda close and I'm giving myself credit lol
Blue raspberry has forever meant blueberry raspberry why does no one know this they're 2 of the best berries that's why slushies taste like that atleast in the UK
blue
I’m gonna be real and say I’m a very picky eater and I don’t like fruit like I have a phobia I’m 24 (don’t wanna get in to it) but when it come to anything “blue” flavor I trust it because there’s no fruit that neon blue so in my mind it safe I’ll never drink or eat anything red or orange
My favorite flavor is actually lime. Only in some foods and drinks tho
In the UK, purple is usually blackcurrant.  Its funny you called out one ingredient of the "blue raspberry" as being banana like, because I saw a video of  banana flavour being made from the scents of "grass for freshness, sugar/candy for sweetness, pear drops for fruitiness and  spice for a hint of exoticness" Bananas being exotic in the UK when the artificial flavour profile was developed
obviously blueberry cant be the blue flavor. blueberries are purple.
Is this why I like the taste of cherry flavored products but not actual cherries?
I love  b u l e  it’s my favorite flavor
I remember the limited edition blue Froot Loops. I felt like eating something special.
Well in my country I don’t have blue raspberry I have bubblegum flavour yes bubblegum is my blue flavour in my country well in my country we do you have blue raspberry just it’s very very rare if you don’t know what country I live in it is Australia mate.
So basically it's fruit punch
Blues is a flavor
I agree with grape.  I live it
am i the only person who hates blue razzberry? everytime i give it a try again i’m like nope 😵‍💫
Hey uhh... its called artificial flavors... so uh... did you make this for views? *dies.exe XD LOL LMAO help me...*
hey bruv there's new episodes of that Amanda thing
I always thought of it as Raspberry Lemonade. So this makes sense to me :P
WE NEED OTTERPOP LORE!!
Wait people actually believed that there is a blue raspberry ?
ngl, never had a snow cone
Once i got near the end, the flavoring made so much sense to me because raspberry flavored soda is one of my favorites and this one particular brand Country Club has a particularly banana-like taste
Yesss, we DO need Otter Pops lore!!!
i thought blue was just blueberry?
I thought we all knew blue raspberry wasn’t a flavor ?
What a great thumbnail.
In my country (denmark) everyone just calls slushies blue flavor
Sour patch kids if you addition is actually blueberry and raspberry but not the normal raspberry tea is yellow faster to blue. What are you wearing them or they could colored or red raspberry’s blu
no but if you're going to make one about how grapes don't taste like grapes you have to mention banana-flavored things! because those, those are out there
I always thought it was a mix between blueberry and raspberry 💔💀 like blue for blueberry😭
And that's why he's the head editor
4:32 You... you didn't think that sentence through, did you.
Blue
Listen, i have 2 things to say: 1.Do the otter pops theory. 2.At this rate u can convince me that if i jump of the Eiffel tower i don't die
Mat pat what about pink lemonade what flavour is that
Matpat: What is blue raspberry   Me:blue
The flavor is blue
How you said "Blue little rings and tentaclesssss" 😂😂😂
Am I crazy, or does matcha literally taste like fish? I love fish, but not in my drink. Every single matcha drink (all from different places) tastes like fish. Am I the only one?
Blue raspberry is a mixture of blueberry and raspberry..
Green apple =🟩 Blue rasberry =🟦 Cherry=🟥 I think you get it
BLUEBERIIES ARE ****ING PURPLE
When he said “what it taste like to lick ariel” it made me uncomfortable
There's a "How to Drink" video where Greg samples and improves a bunch of Chain Cocktails (the series name is "Chains of America" but I don't remember the specific episode), He is sampling stuff that is supposed to have Water mellon in it but it has Peach Scnapps or whatever. he notices that the drink doesn't taste like Water mellon but instead tastes like watermelon candy, and proceeds to have a "Aha!" moment, realizing that Water mellon candy is peach flavored.
Yes! Please do an Otterpop lore episode! I’ve been wondering about this since I was a kid!
Cardboard MatPat just panicking in the background is hilarious
While they arent exactly that bright of a blue i have eaten blue raspberries our store sales them granted its probably just named (blue raspberries)
Blue.
So, it's people like you who make me hate when I open up my package of candy and it's filled with grape and orange 🤮
Couldn't blue raspberry flavor just be a mix of raspberry and blueberrie
OTTER POP LORE POG 7:02
You should do an episode about banana flavor and how it’s based on a banana that’s nearly extinct now.
Blue.
Dan got blue Live him Alone Thats his favorite flavor
In the words of Randy Feltface "BLUEBERRIES ARENT BLUE!"
fun fact the octopus he shows is called the blue ringed octopus. it has the same type of toxin as the portugese man o' war called tetrodotoxin.
Bro just stick it in ur mouth, blue raspberry is raspberry crossed with vanilla and sugar
The one episode that AirUp's sponsorship would go hand in hand with this theory!
did you know the blue side of trolli gummy worms is grape flavored (idk what the brand is actually called if some1 can tell me lol)
FINALLY SOMEONE THAT ENJOYS GRAOE FLAVOR! Ngl lie I thought I was all alome in thinking grape was amazing
I thought I saw blue raspberry so I ate it then I realized it was edible paint it was real raspberry not blue
Then what is the food?
3:55 i would like to take a moment to quote Randy Feltface and say "blue is not even a natural color for foodstuffs, it occurs very rarely in nature, name me one blue food. (audience member says blueberries) BLUEBERRIES ARE ****ING PURPLE!"
Now we need an other pop lore deep dive  MAKE IT HAPPEN
But you are making that OtterPop lore video, right?
i dont trust the fda
Can you do more or theories on Thai food because I'm from Thailand❤❤❤❤❤❤
I refuse to call the blue flavor anything other than blue
I always avoid "blue raspberry" candy.
to me it tastes like ethyl . methyl anthranilate . isoamyl acetate . malic acid . suger like alot of suger maby to much suger . and a waste of money.
I really want that grape flavor episode because its a really interesting story
Blueberries are F***ING PURPLE!!
Blueberry
Blue raspberries do exist they are slightly rare and just taste kinda like normal raspberries. Rubus leucodermis like he mentions is a type of raspberry. It looks very similar to a blueberry color. They’re very delicious and taste like a tart version. They’re sometimes called western raspberries Sense they are native to western North America. They come in red and blue
Am I the only one that thought it was just blue berry mixed with raspberry
You forgot prime
Yikes! I thought yall knew this already….
by the way it is a meme so don't get mad at me
no the flavor is blue
Could you do a brief short on why bananas over take a whole smoothie.
My God you could have cut out over 5 min. of constant rambling and made the video more interesting.
blue.
COMPLETE SLANDER MATT.SLANDER
Blue raspberry is actually my second least favourite flavour.
Not sure if I'm making things up, but I remember that I randomly put a blueberry inside of a raspberry, ate it, and just accepted that as what blue raspberry was. 😅 I guess it must have tasted like blue raspberry
"Blue raspberry" is one of the stupidest things I've ever seen! A great question was raised here, why don't they just make blueberry flavored stuff that's colored blue instead? Blueberry is a great flavor when done right.
Grape flavour is not modelled after table grapes. It was made to taste like a different kind of grape. I don’t remember the name right now but I think it starts with a C.
Grape only tastes like a specific type of long dark purple grape (I’ve seen them called finger grapes) it might be artificial all the same, but it’s based off the sweetest and most grape like tasting grape we’ve harvested.  It’s like how banana flavoring mimicked a now extinct type of banana cos the cavendish banana we have now is really just milquetoast by comparison to the Big Mike (Gros Michel) banana, which was a delicious and instantly recognizable flavor- and entirely wiped out by a panama fungus disease that tore through entire plantations of the stuff.
Matpats snow cone is the colour of the pansexual flag.
Do an otter pop lore video
Video 5 of commenting till mat pat responds
b l u e .
Artificial grape is intended to mimic the flavor of Concord grapes. I hate grape flavor but love grapes. I ate a Concord grape once and nearly threw up because it tasted just like children’s cold medicine.
While watching this video, I decided to look into several products that are labelled as having 'blue raspberry' as the flavour, and what I found was consistently… inconsistent?  In one product, the flavour was just 'Apple + Raspberry'. In another it was 'Orange + Raspberry + Pineapple', in another it was 'coconut water' and then the rest were solely comprised of different flavourings (like what you showed at the end).  So I think the real answer is that it doesn't have a defined flavour 🤔
perfect intro
What doses matpat not understand he got ˋˋblue” HE GOT “BLUE”
Raspberry ❌ BLUE raspberry ✅
Does grape flavor really not taste like grape? Or have you never had concord grapes? 🤔
mmm yea blue flavor
Can we do the otter pop lore? Like really now I wanna see that
Cool blue just tastes the best
I love it when matpat gets so unhinged after so many theories that he begins to question why he makes such weird theories and also randomly goes on random rants that have nothing to do with the theory then randomly move on.
💙🥲
“blue. blue. is blue. ………….. blue.” best script
Matpat I love your videos but you've ruined the last artificial flavor I like
So  ture  So ture
well it makes sense that its called blue raspberries. raspberries are usually sour and flavorful, but "blue raspberries" taste doesnt have a "red taste". But what would purple and sour taste like?
The color system is a lie 🔵+🔴= 🔵 thumbnail kinda sus

Blue foods in our country usually is  a gum flavored
I read a three paragraph article explaining the great majority of this a few years ago, but this 13 minute bad comedy video with editing designed to keep the attention of toddlers is a decent option for the TikTok generation to learn this truly crutial information
but matpat, u had a photo of blue raspberry it must be real!
Monarch butterfly wings do not contain blue pigment by the way.
Bruh I was literally watching with while drinking a BLUE RASPBERRY MTN DEW (it says raspberry not blue raspberry)😂😂😂😢😢😅😂😢
Dan watches Chikn Nuggit.
Blue is my favorite flavor.
Blue crabs
MatPat I have never been more invested in you doing more then Otter Pops
Blues a overated color red is the best
ah yes, i love eating the color blue
So this video made me think of a comment I saw somewhere. I think it might have been on Tumblr so take that with a grain of salt. But I think I remember it saying something about how banana flavored things don't even taste like bananas, and someone responded by saying the flavor of banana that we associate with candies is from a variation of banana that is now either extinct or difficult to come by. I never gave that much thought until right now watching this video. Maybe a future Food Theory episode?
If you want Otter Pop lore 👇
I can't believe Matpat was trying out Chad-flavored snow cones at the beginning!
For popsicles there’s too many red fruits . So cherry is red , watermelon is a different shade of red and strawberry is pink and originally blue was for blueberries . But wasn’t popular so they made blue raspberry
Insanely long intro, plus your script has "but its kinda sending me right now". Bad video.
I’m about to ruin my friend’s career
what does snow taste like?
What about a theory on why banana flavored things don’t taste like bananas?
WoW i DiDnT kNoW
I'm baby 👶👉👈
Blue is sweet and sour tang.
Here’s a question, why do we accept lime more as a flavor than we do lemon, they taste nearly identical
BLUE.
you dont call something by the real flavor you call it by the color
What if they made a blackberry sour patch?
I felt offended when he said to not to mention the blue m&m because it tastes like chocolate. I didn't say a word, but I thought of it and I was still in shock. Anyway, I had to pause the video and I will go back to continue watching some cool content.
1:50 that is the small blue ringed octopus which is one of most deadly creatures on the planet being the only octopus with venom even though it’s so small and cute😅😮

Ambi the only one who here doesn't like blue raspberry flavor? Personally I think it's just kinda bleh. No hate to the people who do like it I was just surprised.
DUDE IVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOREVERRRR
Blueberry
Lil Orphan Orange😢😢😢
Here’s a good question.  What the heck flavor is bubblegum?
a mix of grapes, cherries, banana and ACID!
blue is honestly the best flavor though
To quote Randy feltface "blueberries are f******purple!"  Love your videos keep up the good work
blue.
Wrong channel still like game theory though
pansexual flag on mats ice cream..?
next theory: the history how we arn’t eating real bananas and thats why banana candies dont match us
Mat Pat, do a vídeo on Guaraná Jesus
In Indonesia, we have a similar situation, just with lychee not raspberry
6:53 would this go in food theory or film 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
I actually want a theory’s on the otter pops Loren what the heck please do it lol
I saw the Ghost can and I gotta say that stuff is THE BEST. All of their flavors slap not just the blue patch
Blue
Idk man. I used to think grape flavored stuff didn't taste like grapes too. Until I actually ate a real homegrown grape from a backyard. It tasted just like the grape flavored stuff !!
It’s like blue moon ice cream
How dare you say blue raspberry is a fraud
Ok so follow up to this trying to get a mixture of those ingredients to taste like blue raspberry flavoring
Matpat chose Pansexual flavor
Honestly surprised this video took this long to be made
This video  still left me with one question : why do we choose blue foods and drinks over other colours even tho blue doesn't exist in the wild ?  I would think our brains would tell us NOT to eat it because we don't know what it is but somehow it does the exact opposite.
Aerial tastes fishy

Grape flavoring is based on concord grapes
I feel like anyone with a broken and destroyed childhood would know this already
I agree with head Editor its blue..
me having a blue raspberry iced while watching this.
"blueeeeee" - head editor dan
when i ate otter pops i snapped them like glowsticks and then from there you could squeeze the bottom of one half of the otter pop and that moved it up just enough for you to bit it or lick it or whateever you want.
Head editor Dan would be a menace just because lol
blue raspberry is good okay deal with it
Nothing tastes like anything anymore😭😭
MatPat: What is the flavor of blue/ Me: Tangy? Yeah, Tangy! MatPat: Blue raspberry! Me: Yeah!...blue raspberry. :P
It all started when raspberry syrup was blue
BLUE!
Ok now do blue moon ice
I don’t even like the blue raspberry flavored candies 😭
I always thought the flavors mixture of blueberries and raspberries
blueberry is an actual food it's natural flavor

This was the most annoying video I’ve ever watched ..JUST GET TO THE POINT.
Blue
I have a suggestion for a new video. There's a brand of drinks called "Liquid Death" and on their website there's some pretty interesting stuff like legally selling your soul to liquid death and there's a video claiming that the water is infused with demonic entities but im skeptical. In their terms of service there's a section that says  "All content on the Site, including text, hidden text within our source code, software, photos, video, graphics, music and sound, is subject to protection by copyright, trade mark, and other proprietary rights." I thought thought would be interesting to you considering the source code and demonic themes. I'm genuinely curious as to what your opinion on the brand is and if you truly think that they are actually infusing their drinks with demons!
Are the Theorists fans of Shane Dawson? I love both channels and can't help but pick up on a few similarities recently. Idk, maybe it's just a coincidence! 😅
Blue tastes like blue

As someone who’s favorite flavour is Blue this episode resonated with me lol
To the otterpop theory Mr.MatPat yed yes you DO need to make one as you did one about the koolaid man now it's Otter time u do it ha ha!
I knew that
I work at sonic, just wait until Matt pat comes and tries out “blue coconut” flavor.
I don’t really care if blue raspberry isn’t a thing because it’s almost always the best flavor, it’s at least in the top 3 for me of any flavored sweet things
Worst flavor ever!
I’m blue da de da De di da de diy da de diy da de diy de da de da diy
I admire your work: at least in comparison with other " journalists" you do searching. I had to reach the 32 years old to learn that the red dye in the strawberry flavour and cherry flavour jelly is made from insects ' corpses. Why they don't use beetroot juice as they use for the strawberry flavour Ice cream?
It's not blue raspberry, or blue razzberry, it's just blue flavored
Shane Dawson told me this first
But in sweden there is a fruitcalled blue raspberry
WE KNOW ITS NOT REAL
Before, I watch the video: Whitebark Raspberry
I wasted my life eating blue raspberrys   -  . -    18 years eating blue raspberry

I never really liked blue raspberry. always felt too tart. nothing like raspberry.
Water actually is blue, you just can't really tell unless you have a lot of it (kinda how mirrors are green).
After the tea video, I want to know what the optimal way to make, drink, and market coffee is.  Either at home or when you go out to your local Starbucks.  Can Food Theory make the perfect cup of coffee for a coffee freak like myself?  I'd love to see them try!
Matpat pls do otter pop lore 😂
I'm so mad right now. ..just HAD to ruin Blue Raspberry flavor....lol
dye. end of discussion
blue raspberry is still my favorite, lies can always be used to make you feel better about something.
Theory idea: Since on your ranking Pizzas from different fast food restaurants, you said you would review different places that are known for pizza like NY, Chicago, and Italy. So my idea is seeing what's weird with Chicsgo Pizza and Italian pizza like you did with NY pizza
Blue is a flavour.
I just used to assume it was blueberry and raspberry together
If we want to get into the topic of flavors that don't taste like what they are supposed to be,  bannanas.  Artifical bannana flavor taste more like bannanas than the current strain of bannana crops.
Who looks at a flavour called Blue Raspberry and goes Yeah That’s an actual flavour 😂

I always just assumed blue-raspberry was a mixture of blueberry and raspberry 🤷🏽‍♀️
Regarding your "One food for life" theory - please, check the story of Manarisu (Sukiya) who's been eating food from one Japanese restaurant (Sukiya) using the referral program points. He's being at it for 1312 days now - 3,5 years! The bigger his story got the more referrals he got so at this point it doesn't seem like he's ever going to stop. He's been on TV and even Hajime Shachou, the biggest Japanese YouTuber ate food with him at 1000 days celebration.  It's a great story! And he's still healthy! And a gamer at heart who doesn't give up on a challenge :D  The guy just wanted a Switch.
Maybe a hot take idk, but blue sucks.
I always thought '' blue raspberry '' tasted like blueberry 😂😂
nononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononononono you can't make me believe this nononononononononononononononono please no nonononononon
yall, i must advocate, EAT THE PUDDING, DO NOT LICK UNDERAGE MERMAIDS-.... because flesh doesnt taste as good, duh
So, should we expect a Otter-Pop Lore episode before the summer?
PLEASE do an otter pop lore theory!
My wife and I found out a fruit combination that matches pretty closely to the flavor we usually assume to be "blue raspberry." And it's honestly a pretty literal interpretation! Just take a blueberry, stuff inside a red raspberry, and dip the whole thing in sugar for a single bite. She'll make a platter of them for parties and they're always a huge hit.   Give it a try! It's crazy how close it gets in flavor profile to the fake Blue Razz flavor that's so popular now.
I always thought it was a mix of cranberry and something
I always associated blue with blue berries not raspberries. Because on my farm nothing produces blue except blue berries. The only color on anything in the wild that is edible is always naturally occurring in red and indigo; however blue shows up too but it’s more rare.
Wait…people think raspberries have a blue variant? What?
My favourite Colour is blue
still waiting for a breaking bad "why are you blue?" refrence
blue flavor!!!
Grape flavor tastes like one specific variety of grape - Concord. Get some if you can, it absolutely blew my mind to eat a grape that tasted like 'grape' flavor.
Orange otterpop is sad because it's the least consumed flavor.
I always thought it meant blackberry cuz it looks similar, but now I realize that they actually just made up a fruit
If anyone has ever had a "Blue Raspberry" jolly rancher... That's pear. That's what pears taste like.
Do a video on gimkit lore
i also want a Poly SnoCone
BLUE
as a wise man once said, " BLUEBERRY ARE F***ING PURPLE"
Matpat is gonna rage on the word "blue."
Grape is probably most likely based off concord grapes
You should consider doing a episode on banana flavoring.
The flavor of blue is blue berry
I can’t believe how long this has been a question in my mind, but I never thought to actually ask it, MatPat thank you for making this, I haven’t even watched it yet, but I know it’s gonna be good
When people say "blue raspberry" could they mean blackberries?
Me watching this video: I think you should make a video about the Turkish economy mat pls read my coment
So blue raspberry was raspberries revenge for the poison "rumors" 🤔 Blue Razz could be a YouTuber
We want otter pop lore we want otter pop lore
Wait Amouranth? 🤤 I mean 👀
This ruined my life
Please do a theory on Otter Pop lore!!!!!
THE BEST LIE 🔹️💙🔹️I miss the Icee sneeze blue raspberry candies😢😢 they were many favorite! I could go through multiple tubes in a day 😩
Yeah so we only care about carcinogenic chemicals when its in food. 👍
Blue.
Licking Ariel you say? I’d do it for a penny 🤷🏼
I've never heard of Otter Pops until now, but Alexander the Grape is a 10/10 pun
The blue dye isn't harmless but it's the least harmful
At the ice cream van that goes around the town i live in they call the blue icecream flavour smurf icecream wich kinda makes sense if you think about it.
Matpat eating romania flawor snowcone
A buddy of mine was telling me about “huckleberry flavor” beer and i asked him what a huckleberry tastes like. He told me it tasted like fruity beer.
Grape flavor in candy is meant to replicate a specific type of grapes called concord grapes. The variety we all eat and get from the grocery store are called table grapes, and have much, much less flavor. Concord grapes are said to taste "like an expolsion in your mouth", which is what candy makers were going for when they made grape flavor.
Yes yes yes 🎉 do one with rockstar, it’s my go to energy drink
blue
The blue butterfly as an example for blue color is actually the worst. It’s not thru color partikles, but for the microstructure on the wing on the butterfly. It’s actually really interesting, when you google it
So like are you gonna do that otter pop lore or…..
"I always wondered what licking Ariel was like"😂
The fact that rasberries aren't supposed to be blue and you've never seen a blue rasberrry before should be a big enough hint that "blue rasberry" is not a real flavor.
Well,what a great Mandela effect
My life is a lie
Blue is flavored like a variety of chemicals.
Actually wild raspberries in the Netherlands are purple blueisch
I see you've been watching Shane Dawson's podcast.
After this, I don't just want the grape video, I NEED the grape video.
it funny cause until we moved down near las vegas i didnt know otter pops existed cause my family calls them freeze'ez instead of otter pops
Blue is always the best flavor. I don't care what's in it.
Hey Matpat, since you like grape, here's something for you. Around 2012 I ate a grape jolly rancher that tasted exactly like teriyaki sauce. It kinda weirded me out for a while, but hasnt happened since. We were at high elevation in the Uinta mountains. Does altitude possibly affect flavor chemicals? Like evaporation at lower pressures?  My second thought, it always bothered me that jolly ranchers don't crush like other hard candy, and they bend when thin enough. I theorize that jolly ranchers are a Non-Newtonian fluid, like old glass panes. Or an amorphous solid.
The lore that we want, the lore that we NEED!  Otterpop lore, PLEASE!
I can’t explain the intro it’s just everything at once
Colors are flavor though
Grape is purple flavored
What a way to start off my morning, blue raspberry isn’t a thing. 😃👍🏻
Bro shut uuupp
I always assumes it was blueberry and raspberry that was so popular that companies smooshed them into one universal flavor
Blueberry and raspberry 😂
I have to admit if you asked me to lick Ariel 3 years ago you bet yourself I would have jumped that ginger. Now I can only assume it’s a salty fish flavor
me is allergic ti blue 2, the only blue i consume is blue curacao which is naturally colored and is sweet orange.
what about blue coconut?
Synthetic vanilla be lookin a Lil sus
I actually prefer green apple
was melvin de groote rly an invetor or was he just like edison a guy who hired people to invent and steal the credit
otter pop lore
B l u e
blue
I always thought blue raspberry was blueberry and raspberry flavours combined
This is why my favorite flavor is red
i always thought blue raspberry was blueberry and raspberry that they took out the first berry bc it’s redundant or something
Did MatPat tell me to go down on Ariel???
Mat I'm BEGGING you to do a game theory about Little Nightmares there's so much I NEED to know 😥
But thats just a theory...                                AN OTTERPOP THEORY
For once I already knew the whole story before he told it
Blue.
blue is my favorite flavour
Blue coconut
European: what flavour do you like? Lemon, strawberry and raspberry? American: I like yellow, red and pink flavor. European:🤬🤬🤬

Interestingly, I ran across a Veritasium video talking about how Blue is the last color to come into a language. 1) Because it is the rarest color in nature, and 2) despite the fact that it is in the sky/oceans, it is the rarest color for us to be able to see.
But it’s SOOOOOO GOOOOD! 🤤
In the wise words of randy feltface, "BLUEBERRIES ARE F***ING PURPLE!!!"
6:55 yes
??????????????????????????????????!!!!????????????????
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes please and have a look at your chan
My childhood is now answered
Blueberry
8:45 The companies went from “cyanide” to cyan REAL fast!
Indeed "I'm blue Da Bu De Da You Die" 😆
apparently my internet doesn't want me to finish watching this episode. i can't get past 8:20
So you watched Randy Feltface Writes A Novel. Cause he brings this up in the comedy skit
You finally did this episode!
I'm older i never remember red dye #2 being thought of as cancerous. It thought to make children "hyper" though.
lovely intro
There are blue raspberries but there not used for the flavoring of candys
i still love blue raspberry and grape, and obviously i knew it wasn't actually grape or raspberry give me that beautiful delicious artifical flavor
Blackcurrant.
We had 2 blue of the dart frogs as pets a long time ago! They arent poisonous if you feed them normal fruit flies (we breeded our own Freitag flies it was really cool). I was alowed to Name them as a child so what did i choose? Wiki like the cartoon carackter and wikina.. dont question it-
I refuse to watch this video im just want to comment that blue raspberry is the best flavor of any candy. If you think otherwise then you’re wrong.
Matpat got that pan ice cream
OTTER POP LORE OTTER POP LORE!
You could also make a video about banana flavour because i swear bananas taste complete different from their flavouring
I remember when I was a kid back in the early 80's (in the UK) blue soda drinks was all the rage. They were marketed as (clear) lemonade flavor and branded as "Blue River" .. If you consumed enough of it in one day, your pee came out blue/green which freaked me out first time it happened, lol
Percy
That's crazy. I never have any raspberry in my life so anytime I think of it, the stock image of raspberry with blue color will appear in my head. Turn out I have been lied to the whole time.
Love the thumbnail dude, Ayo you so talented.
I knew this aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaages ago
I have to inform you on something however. The artificial grape flavour is actually a real grape flavour that you can taste in a variety of grapes and it is called Isabella. How do I know? My Mum's partner and our family friend of like 40 years has been tending his own vineyard for decades and he's grown some of those grapes. I've tried them, they taste almost exactly like the artificial grape flavour. Of course, I'm sure the flavouring has been specifically synthesised to imitate such a flavour, just like the banana with Gros Michel, but it is real and it tastes wonderful. Oh yeah, apparently also Concord grapes. Both are phenomenal.
Do banana Laffy taffy
I don't eat anything blue. It's an unnatural color for food. It's a thing. I'm commenting before watching, for the s&g of it. People make fun of me for it but that's how it's always been and always will be for me. I throw blue M&Ms in the trash. Cotton candy is Not blue and neither are raspberries, coconuts, or bubble gum.
The natural equivalent of blue raspberry is just when you put a blueberry in the raspberry’s opening bit
nah blue is real
Blue berry
Blueberries exist bro
Hey Matpat I actually own a snow cone syrup manufacturing company in Texas and we would happily help you if you want to explore how color changes the perceived flavor and we also have statistical data on what the most popular flavors are for are region as well
Can you do a video on dr.pepper ?
The blue in the begging looked like what Walter makes
I have not watched this video yet but I love blue raspberry  Edit: I still do
Grape flavored things do taste like grape, just not the strain of grape most people are used to :)
I just washed my hands with "cranberry" scented foaming soap. Yet somehow it smells exactly like the blue raspberry flavor. 🤔
Blue raspberry is such an american thing, Prime was the first time i ever heard about it.
scientists should get onto making a real blue raspberries.
Blue raspberry is a lie and I LOVE IT!  I absolutely hate raspberries and artificial raspberry flavors that try to be true to that flavor.  It is triggering for me for some reason.  Blue raspberry tastes nothing like raspberry and I quite like it.  Any time I order something with blue raspberry, my wife wonders if I have been possessed or something and I have to explain... blue raspberry tastes nothing like raspberrries.  Maybe there are some people that are sensitive to some component of the flavor profile that says "this is raspberry".  If some component like that exists... that isn't the component that is disgusting to me with respect to raspberries.
1 million people seeing this is not enough like Mat is out here telling the truth on artificial flavors and the history behind it. It's amazing I will forever love his brain and the theory team they have
People google saying -there is no soch a thing as blue rasberry
That's disrespectful... Edison was a thief and does not deserve credit for any of the inventions currently attributed to him. It's impossible to know which ones he actually stole so we should treat it as if he stole everything he ever did. Putting a con artist on a list of inventors is shameful and probably not even accurate as he likely didn't ever invent anything.
I take the margarita popsicle over any of them. We need an Otter Pop lore vid.
I'm blu, da ba dee da you die, da ba dee you will die, da ba de da you die, da ba dee im a guy, da ba de you can try, da ba dee da ba die ima eat you alive
I still refuse to believe that the Blue Gatorade is the highest selling gatorade in our reality
i just saw the poppy playtime short for huggy wuggy cereal made with huggy wuggies real fur, and it said it had a good source of keratin i would like you to make a food\game theory on this because it is food related while it is probably going to help with clues to what huggy wuggy is
Blue raspberry is gross I prefer 🍇
Or icecone?
Matpat eats a romanian icecream
"We now know what it tastes like to lick Ariel." Whoa, whoa, whoa there, Matpat. I thought this was a family-friendly channel.
Peacock 🦚😅😂
It was all a lie
You’d be right everywhere except Australia where it’s called blue heaven and it’s a flavour combo of raspberry and vanilla
Artificial Grape tastes Purple and you cant change my mind  Also didnt blue raspberry start at popsicles because there was gonna be 3 different red flavors and it's why watermelon is usually pink or green
I like grape flavor, I will sit and die here for people
In Sweden, rasberry flavored things are usually pink. Blue raspberry is rare. Strawberry things are red, grape is purple, and cherry is a darker red/burgundy. Watermelon flavored things aren't that comon either, but can be pale green when it's ice cream, pinkish red in candy, or more commonly fandies that are both green and red.
Blue.
Blue raspberry is my favorite flavor of anything of all time
Blueeeeeeeeeeeee the hest opening ever
Icee's were the first place I remember having blue raspberry flavor
Yellow raspberry is a thing different flavour. Best I have had is wild Scottish raspberry
Back in the early sixties there was a Tootsiepop commercial wherein kids enumerated the flavors as "Cherry, Chocolate, Lemon, Lime, Orange, and Purple."  My friend/neighbor and I always laughed, wondering what the flavor "purple" tasted like.  These commercials, which predated the "How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootiepop?" campaign, appeared at nearly every commercial break in our Saturday morning cartoons.  I'm sad that I cannot find it on YouTube today.
As a child I just guessed the blue raspberry was just raspberry but blue. Because the other colours for sweets were taken. Red is often strawberry... u cant have two reds in a packet lol
6:40 - You've got DJ Tropicool (yellow) mislabeled as Cosmic Coconut.  Also, according to Otter*Pops, Little Orphan Orange isn't frowning, "that's just how she smiles"
Please make an otter pop lore video pleasssssssssssssssssssseee 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
My dad told me that companies made their raspberry stuff blue so people with strawberry allergies could tell them apart easier-
Brilliant blue FCF represent
I kind of always knew that blue raspberries didn’t exist, I just never stopped to think about it. Botanists should start genetically engineering them to be real.
grape is the worst candy flavor
that’s dj tropicool, bro. jeeeeez get your otters right.
I'm waiting for the otter pop theory
The relationship between flavors and colors varies a lot between countries.  For example, in Japan, green items are usually Melon flavored (not sour apple or lime).  And Blue items are usually "Soda" or "Cider" flavor.  This is a hard flavor to describe, but it's a very artifical candy-like flavor, similar to some cotton candy or, yes, some cheap soda.  Purple is usually grape and yellow is usually Lemon, but red can be almost anything, with cherry, strawberry and  others (Fruit punch, apple, etc.).  All in all, if you moved to Japan and chose junk foods based on color, you'd frequently be surprised.
Blue is a good flavor tho.
"I am DeGroot."
Wasn’t that always the case tho  It’s artificial
I thought it was just a combo of blueberry and raspberry hence blue raz
Smurfberry         Or when I’m feeling raunchy Smurf c@me.
#AnnoyingteamBLUE
Pre episode thinking: Blue is a flavour
Otter Pops lore theory?
Wish instead of style theory it could be blocks theory aka:roblox😊😅
Ya just came to dislike the video didn't even watch tbh. Because I already know everything this dude is about to say is a straight LIE! How dare you slander my favorite totally real and not fake candy/beverage flavor. Tsk Tsk do better 👎
But what about blueberries?? 😅
Topic idea: what dose rainbow flavour taste like and why is it popular
the intro feels like a bubble guppies reference which, considering matpat is a dad to a young child, is not so out of pocket
"BLUEBERRIES ARE FUCKING PURPLE"
It’s blueberry
Ur just figuring this out. Blue raspberry aint even a real food
It’s because there was already too many red flavors
Blue berry's aren't even blue they are purple
Might be a lie but it's usually my favorite 😂
blueberry is purple
blueberry and rasberry thats the flavor
U you’re wrong blueberries ar real
Classic MatPat trying to gaslight me into thinking that Blue Raspberries and Mermaid or Blue flavors aren't real for 13 minutes straight. Yeah, sure buddy, good one
Blue raspberry is a real flavor
( 2:00 mark ) bro that’s my name! Indigo!
Maybe blue rassberry is just blue berry might be true but it only a theory
My brain just broke, I will never look at a “blue raspberry” flavored candy or drink the same way ever again.
"If you think you've eaten them...."   you were trippin' ballzzz
One time I was trying to get some sort of frozen treat, and the flavors were quite literally blue and red. No further elaboration, just blue and red.
I figured that’s why I didn’t like grape flavor because it didn’t taste like grapes it always tasted too artificial.
The masses demand otter pup lore
The correct answer to every question in this video can be adequately summed up by the great philosopher Carl Brutananadilewski: "It don't matter. Nunnathis matters."
@1:54 Is this Indigo different from Japanese Indigo Dye? I ask because one of the steps in Japanese Indigo Dye making is tasting the fermenting liquid dye. I'm not sure if all Japanese Indigo Dye makers do this but in the documentary I saw they did this. And when they dye the cloths they do it without gloves.
grape flavored stuff does taste like grape, just a less common variant of grapes, just like how banana flavored things dont taste like modern bananas
I would watch a otter pop theory
Should do one on what bubble gum flavor really taste like and how it was invented in the first place
Now I really want a snowcone and it's fifty degrees outside 😅
ofc its fake... have you ever seen a blue rasberry bush?
4:03 “BLUEBERRIES ARE FUCKING PURPLE”           -Randy Feltface
blue raspbbearies duoes exist i eat them in real life
It doesn't matter it's still blue
Boo
Blue raspberry has always been marketed as blueberry/raspberry mix. Ive known this since I early childhood. Kinda hard to believe nobody else knows that.
I voted for blue M&M's too, but they didn't tell me that they were going to get rid of the tan ones!  They've never been the same since …
When i heard about bluerasberry i was like wtf is that? A blueberry ripoff hu??
De groote is pronounced closer to GR-oh-te (it's a Dutch/German name which makes a double OO pronounced like an OH!)
Grape 4 Eva! (Unless it's Chupa Chups then it's watermelon or die)
A long time ago, I learned a linguistic and/or design term for when a descriptive thing starts to deviate from the thing it describes. The example the explanation used was "blue flavor". The save icon would be another example. I then forgot the term and have been looking for it since. I thought this video would use it, but alas...
we want the otterpop LOREE!
I always thought it was blueberry and raspberry. Also grape stuff tastes like corn tortillas and cherry flavors taste like how those red scented fishing lures worms with the curly tail smell. I can’t stand grape and cherry after those realizations.
Him: what flavour is blue? Me: BLUE
I remember always thinking that blue raspberry was just blueberry and raspberry mixed together. Boy was I wrong.
If the Empire State Building was blue because of the M&M colour then Percy Jackson is very happy right now.
Honest question, is this actually news to people? Of course blue raz isn't raspberries lol. Still the best flavor tho 😂
Ok, calm down, it’s only 4 in the morning.
do yourself a favor and skip this crappy video. the answer is 11:38
I never really stopped to think that blue raspberry wasn’t a thing till this video
Okay I’m just gonna say that grape is the worst flavor of any candy, with a few exceptions like I go out of my way to get it out of my Halloween basket
Just wait till kids realize strawberry milk doesn't contain any strawberries whatsoever. Edit: My sister did... And to put it, she wasn't so enthusiastic about it.
Grape candy DOES taste like grapes, but only one kind, concord grapes
ive seen a blue ringed octopus irl before
how dare you say that grape is better than blue raspberry, I'll have you know that blue raspberry is the best color of them all, yes I perfer chocolate, but I'd rather have blue raspberry than grape, because grape tastes like garbage!!!!
Common colour flavours: Red = Strawberry Green = Lime/Apple Yellow = Lemon  Orange = Orange Purple = Blackcurrant Blue = BLUE
Actually when I see blue food I assume the flavour will be blueberry
so your telling me in the distant future someone will actually make a GMO blue raspberry?
WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE!?!?? haven’t watched this YouTuber in so long and I’m greeted with these cringey embarrassing cartoobs
Atleast i know that my least favorite flavor isnt real
Love raspberry, HATE blue raspberry.
2:07 Im blue Da Ba dee Da you die😂
give me otter pops lore!
Can we talk about the fact that banana flavor is based on am extinct variant

Where I'm from blue is Huckleberry. The best blue.
Thinking about it. Iv never had anything raspberry flavored only blue
Bro margarita is underrated
Matpat has lost his sanity ever since fnaf lore
This is nice and all, but no matter what Blue Raspberry actually is, I can rest easy knowing STRAWBERRY is the WORST flavor of anything.
I always thought that blue flavour was blueberry ;-;. Even though their insides are green,  I typically see blueberry flavoured things dyed with blue food dye for that extra color-
i thought it just meant raspberry but its blue
Blue rasberry is in swedish björnbär that means bear berry and is a blue/purple looking rasberry
M&m made the empire state building shine blue?! Sooo the finally of percy Jackson series, where percy asked to gods to do exactly that... WAS A CANDY REFERENCE!
Next time you don't have scissors to open Otter Pops or any similar type of freezy pop, try snapping it in half with your hands, I saw it on tiktok, and I was surprised when I tried it myself and it actually worked! XD Also, I absolutely LOVE blue raspberry, always have, but I've also always known it wasn't a real berry, and that it doesn't taste like real raspberries, just never really questioned what it was then.. :P
Shane Dawson was just talking about this lol i love that you're covering this it -blew- my mind lol
...I need to check if Food Theory has done an episode on "Purple Stuff" from Sunny D
BLUE
Have you been watching the Shane Dawson podcast?!
Blue be rry
But grape candy DOES taste like grape, just not the grapes you normally eat on their own. Their flavor is modeled on concord grapes IIRC, like in Jelly.
Mat: "What flavor did you get?"  Dan: "Blue."  Me: "🎤Da Ba Dee, Da Ba Dai🎤"
I've always been a watermelon/strawberry kinda guy but Blue is good too
Why blue? because if I were green I would die
I’m all about the otter pop lore!
wow great
Easy way to solve this problem is to put raspberry into blue flood coloring
Blue gatorade just tastes like blue. Just pure blue. Nothing but blue.
how baout blackberry? in germany we call it a blueberry
“There is no Easter bunny, there is no tooth fairy, and there is no blue raspberry!”  -Hal Stuart

i like blue raspberry flavor but i HATE regular raspberry flavor
Gartora is jack
The "I'm blue da bu Dee da you die" made me laugh into the shadow realm
How long can you use a redvine as a straw?
I thought everyone knew blue raspberry was just a mix of different flavors and not it's own flavor
Grape flavour is supposed to taste like concord grapes
The way I've always thought of blue raspberry is its raspberries but more tart :D
Grape flavoring is concord Grapes not table Grapes. There are different types. Bad example but I get the point
I was just thinking about this exact topic while scrolling through youtube when all of a sudden this popped into my feed
What's ironic is that there is 2 varieties of purple raspberries.  Royalty purple raspberries and brandywine raspberries.
the world....(nay, America) has come to the point where grown adults actually think raspberries are blue....
Not blue raspberry 🤢
Blue raspberry tastes like "Blue" .
Mat pat your life is all about the "LLLLL....OOOOOO.....RRRRRR......EEEEEE....."
There are actually blue raspberries, these are literally called ”blue raspberry” in my language. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewberry
Otter pop lorree!!😊
Dan gets it. The flavor is blue and that’s all that matters
Hey matpat I saw this theory that McDonald's fries use beef flavouring in there fries
Amanda the adventurer theory next please
Baja blast, what am I
Love the videos
blue isn't associated with happines thats yellow, blue is associated with depression and sadness.
Hey mat pat love the videos but I wonder if company’s are gonna start getting mad for you proving what they are actually doing
Is it not blueberry raspberry
Blue raspberry is the BEST!  Let’s be honest…..blueberries are almost tasteless and whatever they’re mixing up for ‘blueberry raspberry’ is delicious
Isn't purple the rarest colour in nature?
Issa blue flavor!!!
Grape flavored things are flavoured from Concord grapes, not table grapes
I always thought it was a mixture of blueberry and raspberry
If all you in a comment don’t know where that octopus with blue rings are called it’s called a blue ringed octopus which is rather deadly if you can tell

Ok one thing you do have to understand growing up in the 80s colors where the flavors
Licking Ariel? Well I'm married, but I did think she was hot when I was younger. I'd try it
Okay listen it's not that much of a brain teaser it's a mix of blueberry and raspberry combined.
The way I ate raspberries before watching this
I always thought it was a mix of blueberry and raspberry,
Blueberry left the chat
Imagine listing the few deadly blue things and not mentioning Wolf's Bane..
Cool blue isnt raspberry, its moreso a blend. The blue contrast is moreso a gimmick to grab ones attention. And it is my favorite drink. But its a perfect blend
“Blue” - GOD OF EDITING 2023
Why the photo of a 7-11 with the Icee in this episode?! Slurpees and Icees are not the same (#teamslurpee). I expect better fro you Matt!
MAT! WHAT THE HECK! 😂 Licking Ariel???? There's no way to make that sound NOT creepy or implicative!
BLUEBERRIES ARE FUCKING PURPLE
I like most artificial flavors better than natural flavors, because they're always just right, while real fruits are often too sour or too mushy and gross.
Speaking of interesting foods, I have a very interesting idea. Why aren’t you have food there in about monster hunters, hunters foods before their hunts? what which kind of monster hunter games I am talking about well another monster, hunters, Capcom do you have your own recipes online on YouTube just want to playing out pacifically the entrées from monster, hunter world ice born expansion. Way we could talk about our those cats in the game called mega food or not as a part of game theory to however, the ones from the special events of monster hunter world and ice born expansion  I thought it be interesting to talk about those calories and how much calories it really hates to hunt down these monsters from the regular great whatever’s on the way out to the elder dragon’s the three Apex monsters in the entire games in monster hunters your games are loose it in the foods, while we could talk about monsters generation/generation, ultimate but we all night about it
matpat, you are wrong, there are blue raspberries
As my kids will echo me on, "Food should NOT be blue!" People will say that blueberries are blue but the only place I eat blueberries is in muffins and at that point, they are purple, so I still contend that food should not be blue.
My grandpa owned otter pops I would love to see a lore video 😅
Amaranth and cancer? Who would have thought.
in a lot of european countries we use blueberry not blue raspberry   i bet it's mentioned later in the vid so sorry if that's true 😅😅😅
MATPAT   IT‘S TIME TO EAT YOUR ANNUAL HOT WINGS
As an avid purple and grape lover, I"m a bit surprised that blue so beloved actually
You forgot one thing BLUEBERRY
So this is why everything tastes like chicken! My stupid meat brain can't tell the difference!
Also everyone has a blue phase and raspberries are delicious so just pair one of the most popular colors with one of the best berries and there's definitely bAlAnCe
Blue
Otter pop lore!
as someone who has a addiction for blue raspberry, i can say this brok my heart 😢
Blue
I would love to see if otter pops did have whole store 😂
Grape flavoured things generally do taste like grape. Concord or Ontario Grapes. Brain dead argument.
the fact you like grape candy, makes me want to pick it all out and send it to you
be honist though, no candy flavors taste like the actual fruit anyways. I think blue raspberry just tastes like the sour version of raspberry flavor.
Best intro ever.
Well blue raspberry is actually blueberry and raspberry
I had a dream about this
Yes we need the lore of otter pops
The cool blue gaterade was a shock. I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT and most people I know don’t say cool blue is the best.
I use blue raspberry flavoring to create desserts that taste like cotton candy without using sugar.
Missed opportunity to play the Randy Feltface clip of him going, "Blueberries are fucking purple!"
Blue
I thought it was blueberry and raspberry make blue raspberry
6:57 lol
“Now we know what licking Ariel will taste like”💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
please do an otter pop theory
Shoutout to the blue flavor
Oh, ya gotta do purple drink!
I just ate a Raspberry Tootsie Pop. It was dark red and tasted like raspberries. ?
4 and 1/2 minutes into the video and I had to pause the video to make these two points.  1. Grapeflavor does taste like grape it tastes like Concord grapes. 2. Licking arieal would be a felony since she's only 16. Okay I'm done here. 4:36
That's Blue' Actually' Taste' Like Aqua Water Or Juice' Water Little It Okay 💎
blue raspberry, is short for blueberry raspberry
Blueberry is, and will always be, the best flavor of pretty much everything it flavors. Candy, cotton candy, soda, you name it, I want it and I'm willing to die on this hill.
Blue
Blue
Blue.
My favorite flavor of Mountain Dew soda is Mountain Dew Voltage, it's BLUE and tastes like blue raspberry slushie, my brother says it taste like sour patch kids. However the bottle claims that it is Raspberry and Ginseng flavored
The chickin nugit meme nice
0:39 I LAUGHED SO HARD I FELL OUT OF MY SEAT, amazing writing guys
Funny that you used the butterfly as an example of something that's actually blue. It has a blue texture rather than a blue pigment. It's no more "actually blue" than the blue of the sky.
I think I speak for everyone when I say this please do a otter pop lore
matpat got romania flavor
yes yes you do need to do a otter pop lore cus it is ridiculously stupid and I love it
That comment about Thomas Edison being "the greatest American inventor" had me rolling in my non-existent metaphorical grave. Being American was about the only thing he had going for him. Hiring an entire team of people to improve an idea that a couple dozen other people have already demonstrated in the past—is about as far from the spirit of invention as you can get. This isn't the spirit of invention, this is the spirit of capitalism. I don't care if he has over a thousand patents. Why? The way we do one thing is the way we do everything. Thomas Edison was Not an inventor, he was a capitalist. Get it right.  This one is right up there with my biggest gripes with The Theorists content, along with comparing the Cyberpunk franchise to a Gacha game sponsor and calling a Thangka painting "Chinese". Looks like I'm rolling in my grave thrice over.  At least in Serbia their greatest inventor wasn't a moron. In case you're curious, this is what Tesla had to say about Edison,  "I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical American sense."  Granted, Tesla seemed to have criticized a lot of highly regarded people.
Wait if grape flavored things dont taste like grape what DOES it taste like? please make a video on this
They are going insane...
like grape isn't just flavored purple
Now for bubble gum
Yes it is, your point?
GRAPE SUX TRUTHERS UNITE
I've tasted "Blue Rasberry" apple sauce before. And it just tastes like apple sauce.
I always thought that "blue raspberry" was raspberry flavour with blue food colouring so they wouldn't have 6 reds.
We need an Otter-Pop Lore theory
Now I'm curious, what is bubble gum flavor supposed to be?
3:49 GMO's exsist and artificial breeding lol
We need an Otter Pop Lore video!!!
Waiting for the day MatPat finally does not only Deep Rock Galactic lore, but also what each of the beers you can order at the Abyss Bar would likely taste/be like.
Gatorade does this with a blue cherry flavor
Blue
I've wondered this ever since I was very young like 4 or 5 years old
Change your ending from bon apatite to dinner is served

Blue.
6:53 yes you need to do a video
Why is it all companies barley put any blue raspberry in the mixed bags (jolly ranchers) we DONT WANT THE WHOLE BAG BEING GROSS
When he started listing the chemical makeup of the flavors I immediately thought of NileRed 😅... anyone else? just me? lol ok
Do cinnamon hearts. What flavour is that?
Are we not gonna mention how bananas taste nothing like bananas
I came into this video so sure of myself that the flavor was blue berry and raspberry. Glad I took the time to watch.  I was 100% so sure I was right
Color also effects the flavor. Perception of it at least.
3:26 Good, it tastes good
i will end matpat(the character this is not a death threat)
40 seconds in and I agree with Dan
Please do otter pop lore omg
What about blue jay?
I always thought blue razz was short for blueberry raspberry
I have agreed with every thing this man has ever said no matter the controversy but this time I am so sorry to say keep your theories away from my blue raspberry’s (jk I love ur channel ur doing great)
Blue is the best, because it has more anti-oxygens
Hey bro I got it for you it says artificial when I ate it Said that
The fact that there are zero references to George Carlin is a crime against humanity
I love blue flavor
#otterpoplore
The  flavor is blueberry
mmmmm Blue.
You guys should start a MUSIC THEORY MatPat - Hello Internet welcome to MUSIC THEORY
I’m gonna need that otter pop lore theory STAT
just blue.
Still watching the video but obviously it's raspberries but it was so cold out they turned blue... and if I see no Sound of Music reference I shall be sad!!
HOW DARE YOU! Snow cones are awful and snowballs are OBJECTIVELY better.
I'm not gonna die from blue raspberry? I know most food are scientifically produced
0:27 it’s blue a dab a dee aba da! 😂
I remember when I found out blue raspberry’s weren’t real I was pissed
Why do people make words that  desribe food as a color
One time when I visited China I had some grapes that tasted like candy grape flavor
do otter pop lore
Dan knew the mission.
Who says "blue raspberry" needs to refer to raspberries that are blue? It's blue, and it's raspberry flavored.
AGAIN, stop at least trying to frame me as the father!!!
I think grape flavor tastes like CONCORD grapes, but not like your average grapes.
i literally had a blue raspberry snack yesterday and then this video appears..
"I hate you!"
AGAIN World, stop saying sexually disturbing lies about me!!!
I miss Pepsi Blue
Otter pop lore you have to unless you have a plan or your taking a break for once!
Grape flavor tastes like grapes?? At least, I think so....
Was it just me or was Mat extra funny today?
4:01  As the great randy felt face once said, "NO BLUE BERRIES ARE PURPLE!!!" I'd have to agree...
I'm waiting for the Otter Pop lore video...
✨B L U E✨
i can't stand the taste of actual bananas but candy banana is best flavor.
Fun fact about opening otter pops with your teeth I actually did that as a kid and it ripped a tooth out and twisted it pinching a nerve causing half my face to go numb
Blue.
If grape flavored candies would simply utilize muscadine grapes, all would be well.
6:16 someone probably said it but break it in two! I never did it, but I saw it in a video and it blew me away.
THANK YOU!
Mountain Dew voltage is my favorite. It’s also blue raspberry. I’m invested now
The way Dan says blue makes me wheeze so hard it's concerning
"now we know what licking Ariel would taste like"
Food theory idea - Why is grape flavoring in candy associated with purple when green is the primary grape color and why is apple flavor associated with green when red is the primary 🍎 Apple color just doesn’t make any sense
I clicked on this video, and realized halfway through the vid I was drinking a blue raspberry body armor lol
When the intro played I smiled for 4 second then said “Food 😃”
If we don't get an otter pop lure video on the first day of summer... we may revolt.
I will forever search for blueberry flavored candy
OK so this is mostly about artificial flavors but I once had a Fanta that was called blueberry/raspberry and it tasted like blue, so I told my mom and she made me a cheesecake with fresh blueberries and raspberries and it was rly rly close to blue
im sorry but blue flavor will always be the best flavor
i don’t trust anyone who i ironically drinks diet coke unfortunately
Look mat, as someone who is allergic to red 40 i really don’t have much of a choice
Flavour is blue meth 99,9% pure
blue is my favorite of all the flavors!
poor dj. tropicool, being dishonored like that :[
Every time i see these kinda videos about this i laugh knowing blue raspberry is short for Blueberry and Raspberry. Its a flavor combination not one flavor itself
GRAPE DOESNT TATSTE LIKE GRAPE. just so you know matt
InDIEgo
Am I the only one who washes all the sour sugar or whatever it is off and eats it sweet I hate sour candy
bro you didn't know this lol
Blue is my favorite flavor loll
Matpat .....
You need to make that theory about the otter pops and two I'm angry because you used to vocab word and now it's a vocab word I'm hearing these words everywhere!
Thimble berries taste like blue raspberry to me. I wish they sold them in stores but I can only find them in the wild
Still good.
I think blue raspberry has a mix of sour apple and watermelon flavor
Why does banana not taste like banana? Real question
Grape flavoured things actually taste like concord grapes. Concord grapes have large seeds though so they aren't often eaten in regular grape form.
Now where's the episode on Pink Lemons.
we need otterpop lore!!
Mystery flavor of dum dums is blue 👀
Blue Barry’s are s tier
Fun fact- blue gushers are actually blueberry flavored instead of the standard blue raz
I firmly belive is the one keeping Mat from going full haywire with his editing skills, and is so, so memeable
It takes about 5 mins for you to get into the actual video
Raspberries
the empire state building being blue is bc of percy jackson obv 💙
I love it when people freak out when I call things blue flavor
In canada we have mr.freeze “popsicle”, not otter-thingy but we call any long shaped popsicles mr.freeze, to be called popsicles they have to have a stick

I love the intro ten out of ten

MatPat is pansexual.

It tastes like sour cotton candy 🍬 at least to me 😂
OTTERPOP LORE VIDEO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Blue berry are friking purple
And then we have half of Europe thinking blue=pineapple because of Sugus XD
finally another grape lover
When I was little I remember ads for m&ms and smarties having the line "do you eat the red ones last?". It wasn't until I was an adult I realized it was due to fears of the red dye.
Blue raspberry is my favorite. I must watch this video.
I always assumed it was blueberry flavor and raspberry flavor
Weird margarita flavor of otter pop? Wanna find it. Also Alexander the grape
Went to DC and found Blueberry ice cream I don’t know how to describe the taste but it was pretty good
Blue cocnut
When I'm ask what flavor is blue and my mind defaults to blue berry. "I'm blue, baddy be baddy by bu baddy be baddy ba."
I always thought blue was blueberry?
Otterpop lore js crazy
Nobody cares that all the flavors are fake.
the "banana" flavor in so many candies was invented when the Gros Michael banana was the dominant  type.  so... we made an artificial flavor to taste like a mostly extinct banana, and now it doesnt taste like banana
Just wait until he finds out that raspberries aren't actually berries.
Honestly I’d like a otter pops theory about its lore
DO OTTER POP LOR.
Blue is my favorite favor
Umm, why did this video appear as I have a blue jolly rancher in my mouth?
You didn’t go over the fact that the flavor itself originated from a beaver’s booty gland…
Doesn't grape actually taste like concord grapes?
I was actually licking some blue raspberry flavoured Of slime licker
willing to bet it's because some guy just went "it tastes like what a blue raspberry would"
Blue blue blue blue blue blue blue BbbBlLlLlLlUuuUuUuUuUuuUeEeEeEeEeEeeEeEeEeEeE
BLUE BERRIES ARE FUCKING PURPLE

Blue raspberry is just blueberry mixed with raspberry
Me watching this while eating a blue raspberry slime licker:
Can you make a video on why soda cans seem endless
Top secret knowledge:  If you want to eat real blue raspberry flavor:   Eat a blueberry and raspberry at the same time. Try it.  Blue(berry)raspberry
MatPat just described my summer as a kid in 10 seconds
ıɟ ʎon ɔɐu ɹǝɐp ʇɥıs ɹǝdlʎ ʎǝɐ
ITS A LIE A LIEEEEEEEE
Grape tastes like purple.
You can’t be serious lol No one thinks there are literally blue raspberries, it’s blueberries and raspberries combined … hence the name “blue raspberries”
Theory idea: How long can you live only eating hairs?
Butterflies don't actually have blue pigment in their wings so I don't know if that was the most fitting example of blue pigment in nature
Please do otter pop lore
Plz do Otter Pop Lore. IM BEGGING YOU!!!
Flavors dont need logical or coherent names, in fact I would definetly buy a bright yellow dorito called "blinged blongle" flavor
Bleu
Game theory idea: who is Amanda? ( Amanda the adventurer)
didn't... didn't everyone know this already?...
It's a shame, because actual raspberries taste amazing
Grape flavors taste like concord grapes, not table grapes
idc it’s the best flavor tbhb
I disagree
A winery in the hunter valley nsw Australia has a blue wine 😮
Bruh first we got FNAF Lore now we got Otter Pop lore💀💀💀
grape is my least favorite flavour. and I have good reason for it.  when I was a kid, whenever I had an upset stomach I was given medicine. this medicine was grape flavoured to make it more appealing to children. and it seem like every other grape flavoured thing uses that same flavour at the medicin did. as a result, every time I eat something grape flavoured it reminds my of having an upset stomach. plus the upset stomach was often partnered with vomiting which doesn't help grape either.
nice plug in the beginning mat😭
Any pjo fan watching this blue episode?
blue
No… I mean yes but Mat Pat is really going after my favorite flavor now.
Been waiting for this one!
Blueberries are purple...😅
Blue
The blue raspberries that are mentioned are rare, but taste like cotton candy. So…
Amoranth is poison on Twitch also
My childhood is officially dead
Why hasn't anyone picked up on the style theory bombshell !!
I haven't heard a single dabudi dabuda in this video. That's a crime when talking about blue.
Just admit that blue is the generic version of the Wonka trademarked snozzberry.
drank a blue slushie while watching this
do msm game thery vid pls
blue berry
Blue.
Licking Ariel is wild 😅
now, don't tell Dan I ate his "blue flavored" snow cone... o r e l s e
Isn't blue flavor usually Chicle/Bubble Gum? Or at least that's the blue flavor I usually see.
Was that a 5 minute intro?
A friend of mine was a corpsman in the navy some years ago and said that when they offered juice, there were two choices. Orange, which tasted like an orange, and red, which tasted..... red.
Real ones know that blue respaldos flavor is bubble gum
My grandma purposely avoids blue foods because of the rarity and idea that no food should ever be blue because of the unnaturality of the blue color. Cake has blue frosting? Nope won't touch it. She won't buy any blue food and gags at it. This finally helps me understand why so thank you Matpat!
Isn't that just mixing blueberries and razberies so it's a mix of blueberries and raspberry additives
Why replace the best berry in the world
I wanna see a video experimenting the speed of cereal sogginess (which cereals get soggy faster)
Blueberry raspberry?
*PLEASE* do more videos on artificial flavors. It's truly quite interesting. I knew that blue raspberries weren't a real thing but I never knew how they were flavored. I also don't know how other flavors were recreated. I watched your video on how much color plays into what you're tasting and that video goes well with this.
Cool blue and riptide rush are my favorite flavors. They are the flavors of blue, and also purple.
Now dive into the "banana-flavored" foods... 😉
Blue in tootsie pops is grape and maroon is raspberry.
I already knew blue raspberry did not exist. But it’s cool to know the truth of why I guess.
Fun fact. Most grape flavored candy/non-grape foods actually don’t taste like the store bought grapes but actually a different type of grape altogether called Concorde grapes
I love blue raspberry. Always have!
This information Marion will make a huge impact on my daily life, thank you mattpat
You didn’t know about otter pop lore?
I always thought Blue Rasberry was just Blueberry and Rasberry🤷🏽‍♂️
*b l u e .*
Blue Blue Blue blue blue
I remember the m&m campaign. They actually came to our schools and had us vote for the color.
Blue Gatorade (Ice) is my favorite by far.  That said, I think it tastes almost like mild lemonade with a hint of mint.
Blue raspberry is a mixture of blueberry and raspberry. How pointless is this video?
Am I crazy or does Matpat sound really angry
Actually mat pat grape flavor isnt typical green or purple grapes but concerned grapes (sorry for spelling mistakes)
Those otter pops you just snap in two.
Game theory I swear to god if you make them not have blue raspberry anymore which is a lie. I know that then I’m going to get angry if you make them, take it away from us……..
Im 7 and im in 1st gtade
Oh no ahhhhhh help me
I thought blue razz was the combination of blueberries and raspberries Edit- grape flavor is supposed to imitate Concord grapes
Actually the grape flavor is based on a type of grape that we don’t often consume or see in stores (at least in America) I think it’s based on the Concord grape? But I’m not sure. But anyway the grape flavor actually tastes quite a bit like the grapes it is based on. We just haven’t had a lot of exposure to the actual grapes
You guys should make a theory on/about the artificial banana taste, and how it tastes NOTHING like real bananas.
otter pops can be opened by snapping them in half
I love grapes, but I HATE HATE HATE the "grape" flavor. Probably due to medicine associations as a kid ('cherry" flavor as well for same reason).
My all time favorite flavor lol
I love blue raspberry and never thought about how really it was
Most blue snacks are great with the exception of blue jolly ranchers
Blue berry's are purple
Now the real question is what flavor is bubblegum
So when otter lore theroy
Matt is trying to gaslight us into thinking blue raspberries aren’t real 💀💀
I'm just asking because I don't know did Brahms steal raising cane's sauce?
I dont need you tu telll me blue is the best
"What is the flavor of blue?" Chemical.
I recall Blue Raspberry was invented by Koolaid because cherry, fruit punch, watermelon, and strawberry were already all red
Blue flavored things are blue raspberry: 😒 Blue flavored things are blueberry:😎
Blue raspberry? More like blue rizzberry 😎
What is the actual flavor of bubble gum
honestly never though blue raspberry was supposed to taste like raspberrys XD thats news to me for sure

My family owned an ice cream store in the 80s and we sold icees and usually sold cherry and blue raspberry flavor. Cherry was more popular but blue raspberry was surprisingly popular too. I never knew what flavor it was supposed to represent. It just tastes like “blue” to me. 😂
Next food theory: is blue milk possible?
Otter pops were my childhood <3
only real ones cut the roofs of their mouths with otter pops
I KNOW blue raspberry isn't real and it's STILL my favorite. Understanding the science of it is hoW you get me to sub lol
i literally think about blue raspberries all the time omggg
Pink lemonade, fruit loops and apple jacks same thing :).
Bubblegum flavor is usually what I get  Edit: I forgot to mention that all bubblegum flavor snow cones I had were all blue, and that always confused me because I normally think of pink as bubblegum.
Blue raspberries are real.  I have grown and eaten them.  They're more of a purple admittedly, and just taste like normal raspberries.  But they do indeed exist.
I love blue foods and drinks. Raspberry is a great flavour so I’ve always assumed that blue raspberry is just raspberry - which is yummy!
NOTE=blueberry’s aren’t blue.there is no such thing as blue NATRAL food.PROVE ME WRONG.
Americans don’t know about blackberrys?
I thought blue rasberry just meant blue berries and rasberries
I literally got a bag of only blue raspberry Sour Patch Kids LAST NIGHT.
Please make a otter pops lore video
Hey Mat i think you should make a theory on the full new Amanda the Adventurer I think there's a Buch more lore to it
Now I want to see a theory on how Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans can taste like vomit and dirt and earthworm and earwax and all those fun flavours.
My friend does the same thing as Dan

Question- if color is so associated with taste How come sometimes things taste really weak, and distilled
so... I stopped watching this episode half way through... with the otter pops... why are people biting them? just... snap em in half? it amazes me every time people don't realize how easy the "frozen pops" are to open
What are atterpops
Blue bonnets, blue berries
blue
I think he’s sad, because orange is the least popular flavor must be honest the grape and the orange are the ones that are always shoved in the back of the freezer
I want an Otter Pops lore theory
The snow cone vendors had cherry, strawberry, and raspberry. “These are all red. How do we tell them apart??” Cherry remained red, strawberry was made pink, and raspberry… turned blue. That’s it. That could have been the entire video! Lol
im kinda scared i bought the cool blue gatorade and sat down to watch this 3:13 im scared
I remember the first blue raspberry flavor candy I ever had.  It was a lifesaver.
Please do an otter pop theory
Blue
Right now the Empire State building is orange you might be wondering Rose how do you know this it’s colored orange for Suga
Blue
He is right, search it up!
If someone ask me what the flavor of blue raspberry is I just say electricity and no one can argue with me
My ex wife's favorite flavor was blue raspberry and all she did was lie lol.
Because it kinda navy blue
Blue
Blue is my favourite flavour
Blue ıs lıke whipthcream but a little denser
Blue.
Hello MatPat. I have a theory but i need you to expand it. My fellow classmate paula is obese. My theory is that she consumes 2 tones of plutonium (2,E16 calories) and then poops out 2,E15 calories of said plutonium causing a huge earthquake. Could this be in any chance related to the earthquakes in Japan. She likes anime so it makes the most sense that she rolls over there after school  and poops. Please make a video on this
of course blue raspberries dont exist. i always assumed it was regular raspberries (possibly combined with another berry flavor), but dyed blue. there is really no need for a rant about how its not real. i guess ya have to make the episode more than four minutes, though, so i cant really blame ya. like, "oh, its just a wholly artificial combination of flavor elements, whoopty-doo".  pretty informative by the end, though.  id say its not bad, its just a topic that needed to be more fluff than anything.
There is a type of raspberry that's blue.
You better do a ootter pop video we not playing with you
Do Otter theory bc
"I'm blue da bu de da you die" made me laugh out loud
You have to do the other pop lore yes it it and now it's out like that just be the. Facts. Now you have to do it😊
We want otter pop lore
MatPat said “it’s sending me” and I’m pretty sure it’s not giving 🫠
I think Boo Berry (count chocula) was out in 60's?
No Dan's right, it's just blue flavor
AM I THE ONLY PERSON WHO LIKES GRAPE FLAVORS!
"Why is this stuff so popular?" Easy, blue raspberry is the best flavor for everything.
Congratulations, Mat. You ruined one of my favorite fruits
I've never thought it tasted like raspberries. I love raspberries, but I love the blue raspberry flavor more.
the start is my strategy with anyone thats hot headed lol i be colder than an ice block
Otter Pop theory is what we all need!!
FDA approved color additions are still very bad for you 😂
Matpat got romania flavor
Female Ronald McDonald Theory, we need an explanation on WHY?!
I got two for you: Not just grape flavor not tasting like grape, watermelon flavor also doesn't taste like watermelon! We need a theory for these two flavors as well! Also, this is interesting! I always thought blue raspberry was just a sour raspberry flavor and the color blue tricking us into thinking it tasted different. (There's a psychology about how we process flavors based on the food's color. I forget what this is called, but I remember my brother used it as a science fair experiment and it was actually successful.)
So... why haven't we genetically engineered this fruit yet? We have the tools and the flavour color and shape
BLUWBERRY
b
MatPat, what about BahaBLASTS!
Whats flavor is blue?  Me: Yes
Never had Sourpatch Kids, but I’m with you, grape’s the best. It’s usually the BEST flavor in anything.
My man said: "Licking Ariel" 💀💀
And still blue raspberry is my favorite flavor
Japanese grapes actually taste like grape flavor
I have no proper way to describe it but the orange otterpop tastes like triangle
1:10  Theres a rare chance that you can find a  BLUE lobstet
You should make a video about which chewing gum is the best for blowing bubbles !
my mind is blown
Once i found a purple sour patch kid in a regular pack or does it come with grape?
BLUEBERRIES ARE PURPLE~!
And maybe they call it that because it tastes like raspberries And it's blue so yeah that might be
0:27 is blue
Please do an otter pop lore🥹
Probably blueberry and blueberries well Well you know  So blue is the most better color they say like blue brass berry blues So blue is the most better color they say like blue brass berry blues rappers raspberry combined
Maybe they dip something in it and then boom they got it or the dust made the roof Waldo and then I do I tell her to make them to make it like a blueberry flavor
Thank you I despise the imposter blue favor
Never knew blue raspberry existed always called it blueberry
This video is not true it's a cap
2:09 - Matpat pulled the sans' blue stop sign on us
It’s my favorite flavor kinda excited for this
I never liked the “grape” sour patch kids but I do like “grape” slushees and sodas, but “blue raspberry” is my favorite flavor of everything.
Please otter pop lore
To answer your question MatPat, yes you now have to do an Otterpop lore video now.
This on irn bru please
Please give us the OtterPop lore!
Had to pause to laugh at the perfect description of the otter pops experience. Back to the video.
Blue.
Grape flavored candy does taste like grapes, just a different less eaten variety called concord grapes, not the table grapes normally sold by most supermarkets.
Never ate sour patch kids(not available in my country)
color=flavor
I have genuinely always wondered what blue rasberry actually was, but it was one of those thoughts that comes and goes with ADHD
My life has been a lie!
How the do you still have ideas for this channel?
Please do an otter pop video

Why blue raspberry instead of blueberry? They could make the raspberrry just indigo.
I LOVE MATT PATT (platonically of course, my heart belongs my fiance)
I just always assumed blueraspberry was some synthetic blueberry and raspberry combo
Cool Blue is a gross flavor, as are all the other blue gatorades, which all taste the same to me, exCEPT for Blue Cherry.
Day 1 of asking MatPat to do a Otter Pops lore theory
OTTER POP LORE 6:55
0:46 ‘have some blue… oh look its friend!’
Blackberry
blue flavour is just better i hate the colour blue other than in food and drinks i like blue drinks more blue food more
"There is no such thing as a blue Raspberry" Me: Wait, what?
blu burry
So its pretty much a sour fruit punch? So why not just make fruit punch blue instead of red?
I thought blue raspberry was a mix of blueberries and raspberries.
Blue
Green apple, grape, and blue razz berry are my go to flavors! All in the same spot ❤
No offense, but this is one of the first I've actually been excited to watch   On this channel of course

“Blue”
3:20 had me rolling 😂😂
Random potential theory Idea I surprisingly thought about:  Is it cheaper to go eat at a Buffet or is it cheaper to buy food and cook it yourself? If so which categories of food would give you more food for your buck? Finally, overall which of the two is more worth it?
This is one of the greatest scripts across all of the theory channels, and the editing only complimented it. 10/10
The blue raspberry is blue berry and raspberry combined and some companies don't understand that
blueberries are purple!
Grape doesn't really tend to taste like grape, but it sure as heck tastes like purple!!!
we must know about the otterpop lore
People are just now figuring out blue raspberry doesn’t exist? What? That crap is artificial as frick XD
Blue
Actually blue raspberries are a real fruit and are a real flavor. Blue raspberries are actually closer to purple than blue. Also the poison dart frog comes in way more colors than just blue. Also regular raspberries also taste different from blue raspberry.
4:01 Come on Matt, blueberries are purple.  Also, GRAPE FLAVORED THINGS TASTE LIKE CONCORD GRAPES.
NileRed made grape flavoring from vinyl gloves. It was pretty interesting.
Blueberry
Lol
Matpat should ONE HUNDRED PERCENT do a lore video on otter pops. Thatd be amazing 😂
i was really hoping for all my fellow midwesterners that he'd talk about 'blue moon' ice cream!! I've never once been able to get anyone I know to agree on what it tastes like, but I've always wondered since it's literally marketed as the flavor version of the color blue
Don't think you have eaten the right grapes. It definitely does but the artificial flavor is just stronger. No all grapes taste the same though
I KNEW IT I KNEW IT WAS A LIE BLUE RASPBERRY ISN'T A FRUIT!
please do a video testing if the heat of the grill actually kills the bacteria
Ngl this is a theory I thought was coming earlier😂
In my backyard we have yellow raspberry and why is no one talkning about yellow can be raspberry flavor??
This is your reminder that Jesus loves you with all his heart and no matter how much you turn away from him he still loves you, but you need to stop living in sinful ways and make a relationship with him before it’s too late for you and remember that when you stumble and fall he will not only be there to pick you up but also carry you
In the intro Dan reminded me of Gura selling her bag
what does blue raspberry taste like? Me: sweet chemicals XD Nailed it :)
My life is a lie. I always thought blue raspberry was a mix of blueberry and raspberry.
Matpat Amanda the adventure it’s out and it only 8 bucks
Okay guys just hear me out here. While we are on the topic of marketing makes you taste things. Why does my friend say his vape tastes like mf blue razzberry ice 😭😭😭😭😭
my favorite is sour apple and lemon
When are you going to talk about the coke flavour sour patch kids its not cola
the blue Jello I bought the other day thinking it would be blue raspberry turned out the just be berry flavored and it was more like blueberry
Fun fact or not: i have never seen a raspberry candy flavor only strawberry
I guess licking Ariel belongs on this channel more than any of the others, but still...
Wow
I feel like this was an excuse to quickly advertise the new channel... But hey that's just a conspiracy! A food conspiracy!
My favorite is blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue blue bluuuuuuuuuuuu
Before I even watch the video. As someone who had questioned “Blue raspberries” and have been looked at like I was crazy I’m gonna enjoy this video. Because there is no such thing as a Blue Raspberry. Right?
10:17 A lot is Psychological :P
I accidentally disliked lmao
omg please do an otter pop lore video
The romanian flag in the beginning
Grape DOESNT taste like grape  I dont like grapes but i dont mind grape flavor
It's been so long since I've seen the intro!
I'm surprised you didn't see Hank greens video about how grape flavor actually is grape flavored but its concord grapes not table grapes which are the ones we normally eat An Otter pop lore video actually sounds pretty interesting. I've never heard of them before (I've had those kind of freeze pops as a kid but never heard of that brand) but the character names are pretty good. Alexander the Grape, Strawberry short kook, Sir Isaac Lime, and with the animated thing it seems like theres at least an okay amount of stuff to get lore from.  Also btw the graphic for the otter pops had 2 of them labeled cosmic coconut. I had to look it up but the yellow ones name is DJ tropicool.  Also, I thought it was kind of funny my favorite flavor is blue raspberry and my names Danyel and head editor Dan was having "blue" flavor.
It is real but its a artificial raspberry
"I am Groote!"
I wonder if the urge to breed the red out of otherwise purplish variants of raspberry will fade as quickly this time. It's something I've wanted to do off and on since high school, and just never got motivated enough to try it.
Oh don't even with the grape doesn't taste like grape you know I'm going to want to see an episode on that and why that tastes different
I think you just have to lick the right part of the mermaid. 😏
I always thought it just meant raspberry flavored, but colored blue.
yes! Please do an OtterPop theory. They were the only ice-pops I ate as a kid, and still prefer them above all others!
BANANA DOESNT TASTE LIKE BANANA
11:30 before he talks about what the flavor actually is.
It's kind of ironic that they said that red number two is poisonous but then earlier you were saying about in nature blue is danger that's kind of weird don't you think
Blue is my favorite flavor so let’s see what the rest of this videos got in store rip.
Wait a minute I didn't even know about this so at one point red number two used to be poisonous and it was called Amaranth. Why does the name sound familiar? Wait a minute isn't there someone named amouranth? That adds some new meaning to her name. Thankfully she's not toxic so we're good
you missed an opening ablity to do the blue at the end.... oh well.
Yes! Thank you. I've been morally opposed to blue food since childhood. I'm not kidding even a little... I'm not alone.
I really like the background you sometimes you just a bunch of triangles that are all moving I hope you use that affect more
I always knew blue raspberry wasn't a real flavor, but I did always wonder why it was always an option when regular raspberry wasn't.
Ive been saying this for years!
Otter Pop lore next definitely. it's something I've never heard of and I'm curious
Otter Pops reminds me of kisko Pops I remember I grew up with those because my music teacher used to give us those between practice hours. RIP Dr. Clarke
Blue
Yes blue raspberry. Real butter is blue berries

I honestly thought blue raspberry was blue just because the color would stand out, and the “raspberry” flavor which is generally tart.🎉
*blue*
Wasn’t there something to do with beaver glands in the creation of raspberry flavoring? Or was this just a myth?
OTTER POPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best cold snack ever. And yes. I want LLOOOOOOOORRRRE!
Imma be honest I still think it originated as blackberry
Don't forget blue Prime
It's like the blackcurrant story, where the plant itself was not harmful to humans, but it was a host-plant to some pine or hardwood disease and it was outlawed in USA
"now we know what licking Ariel tastes like I mean sure why not?" Me: that sounded weird especially given that they're coming out with another version of that movie. Yeah that's just completely ruined it for me dammit matpat I guess ruining childhoods is your thing I suppose. it's kind of funny that's the first time you've done it to me Lol
Licking Ariel? MatPat, that was  NSFW talk. 😮
We know you know we want otter pop lore matpat!!! Please!!!!
I feel like raspberry being a real fruit but they just added dye to make it blue and then they call it blue raspberry
2:08 can we just acknowledge that matpat is a man of culture with this reference?
Yeah I've heard about that squid or octopus is a blue ring octopus very dangerous and venomous
Blue is actually my favorite color fun fact
OF COURSE Blue Raspberry is a LIE
Blueberries are purple or violet, not blue
He's so annoyed that he says he got the flavor blue 😂😂😂😂😂 to be honest I didn't even know that was not a real flavor blue raspberry
I got you blue Hey gurl You want some tail?
I can't believe this video had to be made. Do people really think there is something called "blue raspberry"?!
Grape does taste like a grape. Most people just think of different kinds of grapes.
Shut up
Yes we need a otter pop lore episode... heck even a trilogy!
Now we all know what licking Ariel would taste like😂 😅
Rubus caesius aka the Euroasian dewberry looks like a raspberry and it's blue. We also got blackberries, which are more purple. So, "blue raspberries" does exist in nature.   The rest of the video, top notch.
This seemed like an interesting video until this guy started talking and making corny jokes.
"Blueberries are F-N purple!"
Now explain to me what artificial banana flavor tastes bad or the fact that it's tastes like nothing
couldnt they have used magenta or fuchsia instead? Its not like they are commonly used to represent specific fruits flavors in food
OtterPop lore when?
PLEASE DO A VIDEO ON OTTER POP 🥺
Blue is my favorite color and taste lol
I thought blue raspberry was just blackberry
My child hood has been ruined
12:11 Bombastic Side eye
No, I want a snowcone
Please do otter pop lore lol I need to know the backstory behind the otter characters. Also love the video. 11/10 as usual
my first thought was ”blackberry” but I guess thats more of a purple? 😅
There was panic about red dye killing you, yet now no one takes red40 and other artificial dyes seriously 🙄
grape flavored things taste like concord grapes. like, EXACTLY like concord grapes
im sad cause of this video
Yeah... Just skirt on by that "licking Ariel" comment, I won't say anything... oh wait..
Personally, the only flavour of "blue" I'd call blue flavour, is blue moon ice cream.
9:40 wait a minute this mf just said Thomas Edison is the top inventor… let me correct that >> Nikola Tesla <<
What is the flavor of bubble gum and why was it chosen?
Love the episode as always. I've noticed that theories don't have the intros anymore recently it's only this video that's had an intro, please bring back the other intros aswell I miss that aspect of watching your video's.
In China, blue raspberry is usually labelled as blue berry. I always thought it tastes nothing like blue berry.
I’ve heard that the grape flavor, like the banana flavor, is a specific variant of the fruit. But not the most common variant.
blue
Bubblegum flavour is my fave!
MATPAT WE NEED OTTER POP LORE
blue raspberry isn't real, it can't hurt you
I just love me the flavor blue. Literally if you make it blue it's allot yummyer to me. XD
Ive always thought about this
Taste blue
💙 Blue is classy... Simple, yet Strong! Fav color! My trenches flag color! Always
I’ll be waiting for the otter pop lore when you release
I noticed on the list of candies that stopped with the red dye we didnt see tootsie pops. There's even a raspberry flavor that's a different shade of red than the cherry.
Blueberries and Raspberries be like
Well of course it isn't real. It's a future flavor from outer space!
Cool blue Gatorade kinda tastes like blackberry
science video idea: brazil nuts.
Technically speaking blue raspberries do exist. The European dewberry (Rubus caesius) is from the Rubus genus, just like raspberry, and they are indeed blue.
Dear Sir Matpat, quite the interestin video, and yet I wonder what does purple guy taste like ... ?
I think blue RASBERRY it's  ARTF blueberry MIXED-UP  WITH Rasberry
resounding duh
Red is always the best flavor by the way…
I'm surprised you don't think banana doesn't taste like banana. like Laffy taffy for instance?? I think grape hands down for sure, but banana is basically the flavor rival in the "flavors that don't taste like their respective fruit" aspect
Dude. What's with the grunting voice every 2 seconds. So distracting - and does this not hurt??
Still my favourite flavour tho🤷‍♀️ Also “BLUEBERRIES ARE F*****G PURPLE” to quote a certain puppet comedian
We need otterpops lore theory
I must know why grape doesn't taste like grapes.
To me all BLUE things taste like NORMAL raspberry.🦋🇸🇴
12:37 I *do* love grapes but hate stuff like grape juice 🤔 I always thought it was thanks to medicine as a kid was grape flavored, and that was horrible. Thought it ruined grape flavor for me (aside from grapes themselves)
You should give @ShaneDawson credit for bringing this up
When I actually have those Sour Patch Jell-O cups in my fridge currently😂
21 hours ago?!?!
I'm calling it RIGHT NOW; First Botanist that successfully cross-breeds a strain of genuine Blue Raspberries wins the Nobel Prize for physiology/medicine.
The video implies that blue morpho butterflies are blue. They aren't. It's another matter of light reflecting off of their scales.
Dan is on the right path blue flavor is the best flavor（＾ν＾）
No duh
PLEASE otter pop lore!!!!!!!
I fucking love blue
Otter Pops are just the American version of Zooper doopers
6:06 this became more and more depressing over time
Crazy that you spent over 13 minutes trying to gaslight us into thinking blue raspberries aren't real but ok go off I guess
Matpat you can have the grape candy and  it tastes like muscadine grapes I know because I hate artificial grape and muscadine grapes because of taste.
"Blue is the rarest color in nature" the sea doesent exsist?
i love your videos i yearn so much
Not super relevant to the video, but Blue Morpho butterflies (shown in the video) are actually blue because of the shape of their scales on a microscopic level, not because of pigment. It's also why they change colors based on the angle you view them from.
Blue raspberries exist, so do golden raspberry
Grape tastes awful unless it tastes like grape juice
I kinda wish Blue Raspberries were real ngl.
Dan has turn into a Pokemon
*blue*
Please do pink lemonade next
isnt blue rasberry just blackberry flavor?
Ya, the proper description for the flavour of grape is "purple" around here, just like "Blue"
The Blue ice thing is gum checlea
Blue
That intro is EXACTLY how i feel when someone says their having a color as a flavor then the actual flavor
Just had blue raspberry band yesterday and it definitely wasn't blue raspberry
Blue
Grape flavor tastes like purple
B L U E
0:06 the colours on your snow cone 💀
i wanna know why everyone i know and me included knew this for YEARS before this video..... we really running out of ideas here
In Germany blue Ice is often called "smurf ice"
Please do Otter Pop lore!!!!!
After this whole video, I’m blown away that you used new Morpheus for your Matrix reference.
isn't grape flavored products concord grape flavored (not the typical grape that one would eat)? (Around 4:10)
Me: eating a blur raspberry juicy drop pop
Now I need a pink lemonade video
I allways believed blue flavour was just blackberry...
I have rallied against blue raspberry for not being a real thing for years. Glad to see MatPat taking up the mantle
nice cracked out eyes
First thing said was that blue is associated with good things so where did “blue” as in sad come from? Also for the record I always thought blue raspberry was a very sweet raspberry, maybe referring to a blue red vs an orange red as the blue reds are darker and the darker raspberries tend to be sweeter while the orange red raspberries tend to be more tart.
I just considered Blue Rasberry as the 'default flavour'. And when I compared ingredients as an adult, that perception just kind of solidified.
I actually searched "food theory blue raspberry" about a week ago to see if you guys had a video. Little did I know you just read my mind!
''blue'' ._.
I’ve seen dark purple raspberries… that’s about it. Lolz
I'm a trash PUBG player and my favorite flavor is fake. Now it all makes sense.
I thought blue razz was just Mulberry but pretty-fied
I remember otter pops growing up in the 80's and I only wish they had a blue raspberry flavor back then. I saw and drank blue Icee drinks over several years before Otter Pops started coming with a blue flavor in their box.The adding of Blue Loo was many years after Icee and even flavor makers were using it for their snow cones. If otter pops is claiming it, they are maybe claiming a date they might have tried the mix in a test batch before a blue Icee was sold in their home town then decided to add it to their main flavor lineup years later XD
I genuinely wouldn't trust the FDA. Like in the gilded age, they've been bought by big business.
I love how hes getting in more of his team into his vids
when I was a kid for some reason I loved blue raspberry jelly ranchers. It may have been because my teacher gave them to us when we did well in class or whatever and I loved that feeling of the victory and Jolly rancher being tied together.  nowadays I can't stand them or anything blue raspberry at ALL. too bitter and not for me. I also hate bitter flavors as an adult. bleh
I’m from the netherlands and we don’t have anything like blue raspberry here. Americans are crazy
Mat: What is the flavour of blue?? Me: Yummy!
My 6yo loves raspberries but always ask for "red raspberries" because I can't get her to accept the concept that there are only, in fact, red raspberries.
Front facing dan almost as scary as simetrical matpat
Why mislabel DJ Tropicool?
Blue
BLUEBERRIES ARE PURPLE
w head editor Dan
I’m excited for the prospect of an Otter Pop lore video.
Reverse Matrix you mean???
I thought blue raspberry is blueberry plus raspberry
It's funny how humans think they are smarter than but we think like animals. They are attracted to bright colours (especially blue) and that is why by nature blue is used for poisonous animals and to attract prey. We are attracted for the same reason, its rarity.
OTTER POPS LORRRRRRRE
True story I once ate a grape that tasted like artificial grape and it still blows my mind to this day. I do not understand why that one single grape off of the bunch tasted the way it did.
This is only in Us not in countrys like Sweden blue food in Sweden taste like blubery and rasbery have the same color as chery. So then sweds go to the us and byes ice cream the colors have shange so its hard to find the taste u like
"Grape flavor doesn't taste like actual grapes." Have you…have you never had organic 100% pure grape juice? It literally tastes like the grape candy flavor. Not sure how that's possible, but I've checked the ingredient list on all of those, and they don't list any flavoring chemicals, so either the makers are committing a federal crime or grape flavor really does taste like distilled grapes.
Grape just tastes like purple, it doesn’t even taste like any fruit
I dont rlly eat sour patch kids
My life is a lie
BLUEBERRIES ARE FUCKING PURPLE!
Yessssssssss the intro is back🎉🎉🎉🎉
Blueberries but with citric acid
Blue
the flavor for grape flavor is concord grapes
Video starts at 5:00
I've just assumed it was blue raspberry because raspberry would look too similar to other red berry flavors like strawberry
omg the snowcone at the start is like the romania flag and im a romanian cool
The otter pop bit was probably the most relatable segment in all of food theory history
And with that licking Ariel line...this video gets demonitized lol (prob spelled that wrong)
Why is it called blueberry when they turn things purple? Its always been an odd question.
https://youtu.be/q5PRb60ifwo in Shane Dawson's podcast at 55:36 they tell you the flavor of blue raspberry is banana cherry and pineapple
DUDE IM TELLING YOU MATPAT IS STALKING ME. I DRANK BLUE GATORADE AND I BOUGHT JELLO FLAVORED AS THE SOUR PATCH BLUE RASPBERRY
Blue food is the best, if you put blue on any kind of food, I guarantee it'll be good.  Blue Waffles: 😈
my experience with raspberry flavours tells me that your theory is not entirely correct.  many things which are labelled as "blue raspberry" often taste like california raspberries whereas most of us think of european raspberries when it comes to the raspberry flavour most of us are familiar with. yes, both flavours are often mimicked by cheaper fruit juices but the flavour most of us think of as "blue raspberry" is the flavour of california raspberries.
Top 10 intros right there
Fun Helpful Fact - "Otter Pops" and other similar "popsicles" don't need to be cut. Just grab both ends, bend, and it should snap in the middle. They do it this way so you can "share" them just like regular popsicles.
Blueberries are purple. - George Carlin
Blue, purple, and red are flavors and I will die on this hill, Matpat.
Blueberries are purple
WTF
Where I live... the following colours are associated with the following flavours. Dark red = Cherry Red = Strawberry Green = Apple Green-yellow = Melon Purple = Grape Pink = Raspberry  Yup, we don't have blue associating with fruity flavour. We just call it "Smurf"
First of all, if you've ever had Concord grapes, that's the flavor artificial grape is based off of.  And you know, I'd allways assumed blue raspberry was a combination of the artificial flavors for raspberry and blueberry.
@matpat, you can actually Otterpops flavorpops ect. are meant to be broken in half and they'll separate and you'll be able to eat them, no scissors required.
Blue berries are actually purple
I think the better question is why weren't companies making blueberry products in the first place?  It feels odd that of all the colors left unused that blue would be it when blueberries are right there, perfect for the blue branding.
Tastes like Roses man I really need to figure out why my username is ROSES ARE BLUE.....
grape flavor is concord grapes. i had concord grapes by accident one time and they taste exactly the same. i hate grape flavored things and i hate concord grapes.
4:18 Blueberries are not blue; they are purple.
4:30 I've always wanted to know that too!
Can you please do an Otter*Pops lore theory?
We can all agree that B L U E is the best flavour
You should do one about why banana candy taste nothing like modern day bananas! But hey, that’s just a theory… Thank me later! :)
Can u do a video about irn bru??
6:52 yes
Blueberry is blue
Im pretty sure fanta lemon is blue
Matt you need to try some muscat grapes. They come the closest to what artificial grape flavored things taste like.
Pls make a otter pop theory 😊!!
What i have learnt from working in a cinema is that blue resberry is just rasberry but blue so it dosent Get mixed up with the strawberry
I love your vids I've been watching them for years one of my pet parkeets died 😭😭😭
I’m still going to eat blue sour patch kids
What about PINK Lemonade
Grape flavor is actually meant to resemble Concord grapes, which are much more flavorful. As someone who grew up drinking homemade Concord grape juice, I can confirm that they are very similar
"BLUE BARRY'S AREN'T BLUE! THEY'RE FUCKING PURPLE!" -Randy Felt-face
Yes blue Barry  inside is green
I need an otter pop lore theory video
IDEA!!  A food theory on why grape flavored food ALWAYS tastes like cough medicine!  Seriously, that’s always the case.
I miss these old episodes
Blue
Weird to see that blue Haribo Goldbears are "blue raspberry" in the US, because here in Germany they're actually blueberry-flavored.
mouthwash flavored
Imagine matpat making an otterpop lore episode
Smurf. It tastes like smurf. Every kid in europe knows that.
Grape can taste like grape  IF YOU GET THE CORRECT GRAPES.   As someone who grew up near Muscadine, a very sweet variation of grape grown in the southern US, they are the closest to the grape "Flavor" we associate in candy. Now sadly most grape flavored things use too high of a concentration of that specific flavor and ramp up the sugar, but if you pulled back those ratios significantly, you would end up with a close approximation to at least one variation of grape. But anyway, it's just a theory, A COMMENT THEORY! Thanks for reading!😊
Otter pop lore! Please!
from my knowledge it was an ice cream shop who had 7 red flavours and wanted to add rasperry. but they didnt want 8 red flavours so they dyed the rasperry blue and called it blue rasperry and people loved it. then it became famous. thats what i know about where it originated
Blue raspberry is my favorite flavor because it has a sour kick which I LOVE.  Also I see the flavor being blueberries and raspberries in one.
#owlhousetherory
Love all of the other team member's interactions in this one!
Wait style theory is a real thing ?!?!
ok
"Blue means sharks in it!"
well, the otters from when i grew up have distinct pop culture/historic references: little orphan annie (orange) sir isaac newton (lime) alexander the great (grape) poncho villa (punch) strawberry short cake (kook) louie-bloo (king louis/sacre-bleu) raspberry  ...i have no idea about manor mango or cosmic coconut. anita fruit punch must be a play on words, but i don't follow soccer.
I always thought that blue raspberry was a combination of blue-berry and raspberry
There is already a relatively blue fruit called blueberry, but they blue raspberry because blueberries taste TERRIBLE.
I always loved blue raspberry so this kinda came as a shock to me
And like that 44 seconds in Dan became my spirit animal.

Points for using "Real" Ariel
"Licking arielle" i think there would be 1000 better ways to phrase this
this intro is probably my favorite one ever XD blueeeeee
m&ms vote was just a bisexual flag
I bought those new kettle corn peeps. They smelled like kettle corn, but just tasted like a normal peep to me. My coworkers claimed they tasted like kettle corn near the end. I'm just going to tell myself I saw past peeps marketing 😂
How did this get 1m veiws in 18 hours 😳
If you don't have scissors, quickly bending the otter pop along the seem side will snap it in half.
This Video Broke My Brain.
He is so angry this episode
super interesting, because a lot of foods/candies here don't have blue variants for that very same "it's poisonous/you get cancer" reason. at least from what I was told as a kid
Blue
boo berry
MatPat: Besides the m&m, what is the flavor of THESE?  Me: Sugar.  MatPat: Blue raspberry?  Me: SUGAR.
Blueberry is purple
petition for matpat to make a otter pop lore theory
Percy Jackson approves this episode
This is literally the first time in my 18 years of life I thought about the flavor “blue raspberry” I heard it and just never thought about “oh this is flavored after that red little berry”
can you please make a episode about why no banana flavored thing taste like banana
Matpat getting that romanian flavored ice cream 🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴🇷🇴
Blue
Blueberries are ****ing purple
Please do a otter pop theory. I have never wanted a theory so much
Glad I watched this. I knew blue raspberries weren't a thing but I read somewhere that it's just raspberry and and blueberries together. Thanks for informing 😁
Matt, pat this was the best one u ever did
if you try grapes in other countries you can better understand the grape flavor
My life is a lie...
18 h.
blueberries are purple, you cannot change my mind
Grape flavor actually tastes like concord grapes (not table grapes).
In Germany, Blue Raspberry doesn't exist. You know what flavor blue things are? Smurf Flavour. Yup.
Blue raspberry is raspberry that is blue so u can differentiate from other colors 🤔
Jake Peralta needs to watch this
This is crazy that you made this video. I just had a thought about bubble gum and would love a video on how that flavor came to be.
Yes, do an otter pop lore Theory!
Should I tell him that banana flavor candy doesn't taste like real banana?
I always assumed that blue raspberry was a blueberry and raspberry combined.
something doesn't have to exists to be loved
6:50  yeah you need to do an Otter pop lore episode.
There is a flavor called “Red” too. It’s just not as good as blue. Look up “Red pop”  red taste like sweet tires 🛞 . It’s not popular.
Otter pop lore please 🙏
Thats jello not pudding
You should do an episode on "You are what you eat" - How much of that is true? For how long do you take on the properties of the things you eat? What properties do you take on? If anybody can do it, you can MatPat
first time I heard about "Blue raspberries" in my life
Blue is the best flavor tho. So…. 3:39
This theory obviously forgot that the Simpsons taught us that color is a fruit, in this case Purple https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGH-b3xtDm4
On the topic of dans ✨blue✨ we also refer to ‘mountain berry’ Powerade as ✨blue✨   Partner: ‘hey which Powerade mix do you want?’  Me: ‘✨blue✨’  Partner: ‘what flavour even is blue? It just taste like blue 😅’
Wait, otter pops are characters... and you're supposed to rip off their head and devour their insides, then discard their drained, empty skin in the trash once you're done.  Who the heck was responsible for marketing this to kids?! I'm starting to see why the orange one looks so depressed! SHE KNOWS!! What do you suppose happened to her parents for her to become an orphan? :x
dam the otter pops got Mat Pat thinking
Also ⅓ through making a predicting statement blue raspberry is to my awareness always been blueberry raspberry flavour
Blueberry???
This episode is so violently American. I have never come across blue raspberry in Europe. Not in France, Germany, Switzerland  Austria, the UK, Ireland or Hungary. It's just not a thing here
How did I never hear until style theory until now
You are forgetting yellow rasberry
Cam I just say both as a child and current age. I refer blue colored food and drinks as blue flavor
i thought blue raspberry was just blueberry and raspberry, it made sense to me.
banana flavored candy doesnt taste like banana so what is it
its a zooper dooper not an otter pop imposter
4:32 sounds soooooo sus out of context lol
I always thought Blue raspberry was blueberry
I always thought it was a blend of blueberries and rasberries.
Salmbär tho
Otter Pop lore, yes puhlease!
If Percy Jackson existed he would've eaten up this episode as soon as the notification came up 🤣  💙 BLUE FOOD 💙
I hate raspberries and anything raspberry flavored but I always liked blue raspberry
i mean i thought it was pretty obvious that "blue raspberry" was a lie. never heard about blue raspberries existing outside the flavor so i assumed it was just some weird quirk
8:24 I KNEW IT!!! I KNEW SHE WAS BEHIND THIS!!! SHE CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
My fav flavor is usually Green... its apple, or lime once in a full moon watermelon but I like green.
Nice video
Blackberries are just dark blue raspberries, prove me wrong
Blue.
"Now we know what licking Ariel would taste like." - MatPat, 2023
THANK YOU!!! I’m sick and TIRED of this flavor. Bro when I grab something BLUE I expect it to taste like BLUEBERRY. If I wanted a Raspberries flavored snack ID GET RASPBERRY FLAVOR. Sorry, I’m just a big fan of blueberries so this disrespect angers me
Well obviously. I have been saying that blue raspberry is a terrifying flavor for years, alongside mysterious Gatorade flavors.
what does the octopus bite you haha
So glad im not the only one that taste margarita in those pops
Cook in a dish washer. See start of Red Greed 280.

3:53 you’re telling me of all the genetically modified fruits they made, they couldn’t genetically splice blueberries and raspberries together?? Like I know for a fact hybrid fruits exist
can't wait for the Otterpop LOORREEEEEE
me who is malding over the fact that THOSE ARE FREEZIES OMG also I've never seen those flavors in store except for twice, I'm not sure if we those here.
If you've ever grown blackberries, you would disagree with the statement "there are no blue raspberries".
It’s just blackberry OK just blackberry
Otter Pop lore video plz
b l u e f l a v o r

matt PLEASE do a theory on the lore of otter pops, i need to see it
It would have been perfect for Air Up to be sponsoring this vid it was all about tricking the brain to what it's tasting
Blue taste salt.
Im BLUE DA BU DI DA BU DAH🤟💯🖤🔥🙌
Hey Matpat I think you should do more research on blue poisonous dart frogs because I have around 20 of ‘‘em there only poisonous when they eat a very specific type of ant🐜
There are actually blue raspberries on the åland islands in finland. I have eaten some when I went on a walk somewhere.
pls do otter pop lore i need to know abt the orange orphan otter
It might sound dumb, but I honestly didn't know that blue raspberry wasn't a real type of raspberry until I had to Google it about five years ago
We need otter pop lore
Melvin the big? or Melvin the great? in english? is he dutch? why am i asking is he dutch? well i speak afrikaans thats why, well it transelates to the big but maybe its the great.... like the great karoo is the big karoo in afrikaans
Icee brings back memories
I don’t care what blue raspberry is it’s my favorite
I don’t care it’s a lie it’s blue😀
I like that powdery purple flavor
I'm sure someone else has said this, but grape flavor is concorde grape which definitely does taste like that but is somewhat specific to the New England area and doesn't hold up well to shipping.
Grape, cherry, banana, acid, blue color...   I actually have the fruit and some citric acid powder on hand, along with food dye... I wonder what would happen if I smoothie'd them all together...
"im blue da....." - frog, thats the funniest part of the fideo
Try Concord grapes
Hot take right here: artificial grape is the best scent/flavor and always tastes the same. Perfect.   Tbh it's the only flavor I'm ok with because completely artificial
Blue has the most anti oxygens - Frank Reynolds
The blues jesse
I love you Matthew Patthew
late need to go soon so going to watch realy quick
Does the Snozberry taste like Snozberry?
Just wait until MatPat learns about blackcurrant flavoured stuff. In the UK, we don't have grape flavoured drinks/sweets (except for imported American stuff). Instead, purple = blackcurrant. It doesn't taste like blackcurrant, of course.
otter pop lore now
Ah yes, my favorite flavor, BLUE
Related to flavours that would be interesting to see MatPat tackle in a video:   I read somewhere (Cracked I believe) that the flavour most associated with Banana candies is based on a species of banana that no longer exists. And cursory research indicates that's kinda true? Just saying, could be fun to watch in a digestible (heh) format!
Everyone seems perplexed by the idea of blue raspberry, but I just assumed that it was meant to be like a blueberry mix with raspberry 😂
As soon as he said blueberries are blue my brain went "BLUEBERRIES ARE PURPLE-" but i love the video lmao
Cool
Love me some blue.
Pink.
Blueberry: hello  Blue Raspberry: *comes out of nowhere  Candy Manufacturers: Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm, You  Blueberry: wait what the fu-
this is fascinating as a brit! Here, green is often lime, but is sometimes apple. Pink is raspberry, red is strawberry, cherry is a dark pink-red, and purple is blackcurrant. We don't often have watermelon, blue raspberry or grape in our sweets!
Blue has the same flavor as cold. Trust me im on the internet.
I was just discussing this yesterday when I saw a blue raspberry flavored water… it was clear. Why not just make it Raspberry?
Not done with the video yet, but I've always thought it was like a red velvet/chocolate situation - like red velvet is just chocolate + red colouring but we still think both of them taste distinctly different. So, in my mind I always thought blue raspberry was just raspberry flavour + blue colouring and it just tasted different. But then again, that's just what I thought and, I don't really have much reasoning so...
Otter Pop theory 😂
I, as a blue curacao syrup adict, asociate blue with grapefruit.
My girlfriends name is Ariel and she tastes pretty good
Another curious thing about that blue dye. The reason it's so safe is that your body can't digest it or break it down in any way. It's the same color going out as in. If you ingest enough of it, it makes your poop bright crayon green.
pov:ur name is blue
I was just saying two days ago that my favorite fake flavor is blue raspberry
blue tastes of blueberries ;)
It's confirmed, Style Theory is toxic.
Okay that accidental ignorance about the flavor of grapes means you need to do a new episode! Get some muscadine or scuppernong grapes, and blow your very mind
Blue is the best flavor. Also if we don't get an Otter*Pop video I'm going to be upset.
Dan, you mean xD x
I think that blue raspberry was made because people wanted to have another good flavor but red was already taken by cherry or strawberry, and maybe other things, so they just colored raspberry blue and called it a day.
Blue Raspberry flavour is there because Americans didn't have a large market for blueberry and so most Americans had no idea what a blueberry was, The rest of the world calls "blue" flavour "blueberry".  As an Australian my children love blueberries and it is a common addition to cereal, yoghurt, or simply eaten by themselves.
To quote the comedic Randy Feltface, “BLUEBERRIES ARE F***ING PURPLE”
the other day I got a slushie at the movies, blue flavor, and a friend asked what it was, and I genuinely had no idea what to answer. raspberry came to mind, but I don't like raspberry flavor, and it doesn't taste like it. nice to know there's an answer
Uhm…can’t blue be *Blueberry* ?
The best thing for me in your channels is that I can see how much US culture differs from mine. Im not from USA and I have never heard of blue raspberry, but  it seems from the way you speak about it like it is a normal thing in USA. Also where I live (Poland) the relations between colors and flavors is also way different: blue is blueberry, raspberry is pink, strawberry and watermelon both are red, grape is super rare to find as a flavor of anything, and if something is green its more likely to be lime than sour apple, and this is crazy how things that you thought were super natural and intuitive are actually very different on other places.
WoW my whole life has been a lie- 😢 edit:jk I knew that blue raspberry has always been replaced with other things like grape or they would just Color it blue just mixing random potions to make it blue
If you cover grape flavor I BEG you to also include the green grape flavor that is soooo popular in asia (specifically i know of korea)
As someone who works in a snow cone place I can confirm that Dan is actually correct
Yellow sour patch my fav
Percy Jackson will not like this video😂😂
blue
Still the best flavor😊
Me who thinks it's all blueberry
Cool theory but now I’m concerned on what people think Mermaids taste like… o~o
5:35  according to wikipedia that's Blue No.1...  Brilliant blue FCF (E133).  or at least, that is the chemical formula for Blue No.1 Blue No.2 is Indigo carmine (E132), and is used as a pH-indicator, among other things.
Otter pop lore gang 😂 👇👇
This might be a language/ location thing but I always thought blue was blueberry flavored (even if blueberries are more of a indigo/ purple rather than neon blue)
I don't know who ever thought blue raspberry tasted like raspberry. I didn't, I mean...I thought it tasted a little like raspberry but more.."blue"? Of course, that's not a thing, but I don't really know how to explain it. More sweet and cool tasting. I'm struggling to explain it but I never really thought of it as really tasting very much like raspberry. It's just its own thing.
Grape does taste like grape though. It just tastes like concord grapes (think grape jelly) rather than the table grapes usually sold at the store.
Blue raspberry is my favorite flavor
ive eaten grapes that randomly tasted grape flavored..  likely after eating alot of sugar before
I've never seen a blue raspberry flavour anything in my life in England
Blue Chain
Blue pepsi
I always thought it was blueberry mixed with raspberry
yes matpat, you have to do a lore video for otterpop.
Blue raspberry will live on
My flavor is green
BLUE
blue.
I always thought it was a mix of blueberries an raspberries
not me trying to dis entire video, cuz i thought he's talking about blackberries 🤣 (yes English is not my first language and in our country we have yet to discover blue raspberries)
This is very limited to junk food in North American culture. Any good pastries with raspberry normally looks like the color fushia or pink/red.
Amouranth is a cancer causing agent?!
How to make blue raspberry: step 1:get a raspberry step 2: due the raspberry with blue food coloring nobody knew that lol
Ada Indonesia coy moment
We know.
Videos starts at 3:35 “what is a blue raspberry”
I never heard of blue berries being popular. Must be a stupid american thing!
Blueberries are purple
“Blue 😑”  ~Dan
I also want to say, that by God does strawberry NOT AT ALL TASTE LIKE STRAWBERRY

2:17 Trivia Time: Did you know Blue Flags are used by the US Railroads as a sign of Danger? A blue flag indicates all trains are stopped or trains aren't allowed to go down a certain section of train track.
Quit pushing Style Theory on us MatPat Q_Q  Love you but it was a swing and a miss.
Do a conspiracy of corn
The start of this video remind anyone else of RT Games’s stardew valley play through
Some foods use the  blue berrie name  instead
Yes please to otter pop lore theory
I watched this while drinking my blue RASPBERRY preworkout lol
I think all of us already knew this. But thanks for explaining ratpat.
Whoever is writing these intros needs to take the day off. Not funny.
You never noticed the characters on the Otter Pop packages?
matpats flavour you could say is fruity :>
100K likes on this video and matpt will make a otter pops video (if he sees this comment)
Continuing to ruin childhoods yay
out of all the theory channels food theory definitely seems like the most American one out of the bunch with how many times I just feel out of the loop when MatPat references some food item like it's something we've all heard of before
Ph God were about to gte lore on a POPSICLE company- *I'd love it*
Am I the only one who has never heard about “Blue Raspberry”? Must be an American-only thing
1:45 no because im australian and know what it is
Why did matpat get the Chad flag snow cone or is that the Romanian flag
I eat blue rasbery but its more purple than blue
Also, banana seems to not taste like banana, but actually just tastes like an extinct species of banana.
I've had this dream since I was little, mark my words, I will create a synthetic blue raspberry.
Blue.
3:17  I got called out way to hard
I love the theory videos where Matpat tangents towards about 5 other potential video topics. It's this kind of unregulated and chaotic energy that brings me back
Its flavor mimics the flavor of blackcap raspberry Rubus leucodermis, like wild berry
THE INTRO IS BACK

Blueberries are purple fight me 😂
Head editor dan breaks bad
I thought it was common knowledge blue raspberry is a man made flavor and not naturally occurring flavor
Now cereal then milk or milk then cereal? I dunno what to do please make a theory about it
The stance on that frog though
"Blueberries are ******** purple!" -Randy Feltface
Blue raspberry may be a fake flavor, but it's an awesome flavor. Something about the color blue and the flavor of raspberries go together perfectly.  Here in America, raspberry is basically the default flavor for any food or drink colored blue (although there are exceptions like the "Blue" flavor of Red Bull which is actually blueberry).  Another exception (if you grew up in the Midwest like me) is "Blue Moon" ice cream. The appearance would suggest that it's blue raspberry flavored, but it's not. It's more of a cotton candy/bubblegum type of flavor. I tried it once and was so confused by the way it tasted. It tasted "pink" if that makes any sense to anyone.
"Blueberries are fucking purple!" Randy feltface
Blue, purple and green are all flavors and my mind can not be changed on this matter.
Why not just using a bramble as a „blue raspberry“? Tastes better anyways
BRO, AT THIS POINT CIA SHOULD JUST HIRE YOU ON CASES JESUS
What did you say about the weird margarita flavor      Jk
WE NEED A OTTERPOPS LORE THEORY
Omg when you said “grape taste like grape I was thinking of how Watermelon tastes NOTHING Like watermelon flavor
I actully agree with this 100% because I have tasted raspberry which tastes nothing like blue raspberry
BLUE IS THE BEST FLAVOR
blue
Its blu not blue
I got to try Jolly Ranchers (I'm German and we don't have them here) and I gotta say, Grape tastes absolutely delicious <3
Wait, does that mean people with blue eyes have some manner of natural defense they are advertising but we know nothing about?
Flavor I love is Lemon and Lime.
YESH! DUU AHTTER PAWP LOHR!!!!!!!!
Wait so you’re telling me that the Australian Zooper Dooper is just RIPOFF… OF OTTERS?!? my childhoods is in shambles
The way my jaw dropped at the Ariel line 😂
I’m Dan’s defense, if blue is an option I’m always pickin blue 😂
I Gues the flavor is citrus berry blend....... I bes at 4:23 in video. lets see if im right.
Blue raspberries are real
Pink food color was expensive so they used blue.
Nah just let dan enjoy his *BLUE*
)Jim carey in Liar Liar parody) "The ice is blue! the ice is blue! The ...(Insert Expletive of choice here)...ice is blue!!!!!!"
0:19 head editor dan as the voice of every little kid
OMG so cool
Maybe blue raspberry is supposed to be raspberry flavored, but blue. Perhaps blue raspberry is describing the look of the food/beverage as well as the flavour. For sour patch, they wanted to say 'Hey this might be blue, but it tastes of raspberry'. This theory would mean that blue raspberry is just a blue version of the raspberry flavour, rather than a flavour by itself. I hope this makes sense.

I always thought it was blueberry
I love MatPats Pansexual Shaved Ice
Its Blueberry or its actually raspberry with blue food coloring
BLUE IS DELICIOUS AND YOU CAN'T STOP ME
I'll be honest I thought blue razzberry was just blueberry and raspberry together
Why blue raspberry? 1) raspberry tastes better than blueberry 2) the natural raspberry color directly competes with strawberry and watermelon. 3) nobody really likes grape and a lot of people like the tartness of raspberry so in order to add the raspberry to the flavor line, line up the blue! Wrote this before I watched MatPats vid!
Did everyone just ignore Blackberries?
lol, Yea, even back in the 70s/early80s we joked that blue was a flavor. I love it though, gotta admit, blue is my favorite flavor. Even as an adult I am a sucker for anything blue.
for me blue is multi fruit.
0:38 The Blue Meme
Matpat really had no idea what to do with the opening skit today, huh?
I didn't even know blue raspberry is a thing till this video, over here blue means blue berry that's all 🤣😂
The energy drink sucks
Amaranth is cancerous...... yup, no surprise there. 😜
It's strange because here in England it's quite rare to find unnatural coloured or flavoured foods
Blueberries are just Blackberries, right?
Where I live blue is more likely to be blueberry flavoured. If something is blue raspberry it is likely to be imported from America.
yo, matpat, what colour would you give each flavour if you made candy??
i remember getting blue raspberry otter pops cause they made my tongue blue, kid me thought it was hilarious.
6:45 why are there 2 Cosmic Coconuts?…
Dan is officially my favorite person there now, blue.
Time for a new series. Every artificial flavor that doesn't taste like the real thing. Time to cover grapes, bananas, and watermelon.
Cybart got the Sky Blue Snowcone
When I was a kid, I was pretty poor. My mother used to buy knock off homebrand soft drink for me and my brother to have dinner with. And the really funny thing. The two drinks we had were "Orange", and... "Green". Like, what on Earth is green?  Apparently Green is fizzy lime cordial flavour. It's quite decent as a soft drink, and I'm surprised it's not a mainstream flavour.   Anyway, I love that the brand we drank didn't name the drinks after the flavour, but rather the colour for some bizarre reason. Orange gets a pass tasting like melted down tic tacs, but I got no idea how Green got approved by whoever was in marketting lol.
I know a few fruits that are green coming from a harvesting period. They must be Agriculturally Modified
wait. Why are there two cosmic coconut otters?
Blue.
I've always told people that blue just tastes blue. They look at me like I'm crazy... 😢
In Australia we don't have things called "Blue Raspberry", we just have Raspberry flavour, and it's blue. If you ever questioned it as a kid, you definitely heard the "Red was already taken" story.  It's funny to hear that the American side of the story involves way more confusion lmao.
13 minutes later and all Matt's done is prove Dan right, Blue is its own flavour, and that's what he got! xD
If you're gonna do an episode on grape, don't forget blackcurrant!
THE INTRO IS BACK!!!!
So i’m eating jolly ranchers right.
Do a otter pop lore theory
It's BLUE
imagine matpat starts to talk about something from fnaf in this 💀
Mentioning purple grape flavour at the end of the video... In the UK we don't even have grape flavour. Purple is for Blackcurrent flavour. Purple Blackcurrent Skittles are King!
6:12 otter pops kinda sound like zipper doopers ngl
blue
I always thought blue raspberry was raspberrie or cherry and lime, I guess I wasn’t too far off
GRAPE GANG UNITE!!
“so let me ask you. what  FLAY-VOU-RRR did you get DAN.”  yea DAN. 😡😡
Finally an answer to the flavour of blue raspberry!
"blue raspberry" is Blackberry. Bright blue flavored shaved ice is actually... just blue. this has been the case since the first ever blue cold thing. and yet people talk about raspberry or something. Though honestly I never heard of blue raspberry flavor. I heard blackberry and grape but...  a Slush company called it "Chemical Blue" and "Windhsield Wiper flavor"... but they also had "Liposuction beige" and "Yellow Canary" and... "Crushed Red Panda"... lol. Also, some people have weird DNA. the same way Lavender tastes like soap... to me, raspberry taste like water. plain water. kinda taste like cold water no matter the temperature of the raspberry. It only taste different when it's pippin' hot or when added to another fruit/berry (especially banana) or with vanilla soft ice cream. specifically soft ice cream.
Blueberry
I always thought raspberry was blue so you can tell it apart from the red strawberry
"the least harmful" good to know it's still harmful
Yes do otter pop theory.the internet is begging for it
Blueberry?
aight i’m still gonna eat the blue raspberry flavors tho 😂
this is now day one asking for otterpop lore
Isn't blue raspberry just blueberry + raspberry?
Blue raspberry is rhe works of the devilish nature of man
I think Dan bought meth guys...
1:46 so many tourists in australia are dumb and touch these and he bites you and ur dead in 2 minutes unless you get to a hospital
last sunday i went to drink bubble tea with a friend and i took blue ras flavor and had the exact intro conversation. I feel like you overheared our convo lmaooooo
Really?
ow so that's why viagra looks tasty
I have never even heard of Otter Pops. Yes please, we need the lore!
Matpat just found a way to spam colour related theories for months...
Blue
"Blue is one of the least naturally occurring colors". Brother, look at the sky. And you say that it's "not actually blue, it's just light refracting in a certain way", isn't that how ALL color works?  And it doesn't matter if it's *technically* not blue. That is the color of the sky, meaning, that is the color that everyone (aside maybe colorblind people) sees. You literally cannot argue that the sky is not blue. At least, no more than you can argue that leaves are not green (ie. "those aren't actually green, they're actually shades of red, yellow, and brown that you see in fall. They just look green because the cloroplast drowns the other colors our for it to look green. Like, yeah, there are other colors behind it, but it is that green dominating over other colors that makes it green) , or that those Roscolux theatre light gels aren't blue.
If you going this far for just a "blue" flavor then i give you a real challenge, uncover the Mysterious flavor of the KND ice cream
As a european I have to say this: Thanks for clearing all of this up, I never understood what you americans meant with Blue Raspberries.
I've never heard of blue raspberry, in Australia everything blue is usually blueberry flavour.
I just thought blue raspberry was an American way of saying blackberry.
In Mexico blue is vanilla or bubblegum flavor
When I ate blue ice-cream with my class, my poop was blue for the next WEEK
Otterpop llllllloooooore???!!! I'm here for it. I want this to be a thing. Do it. #OtterpopLore
6:43 i see something wrong here
AFAIK Grape does actually taste like grape, just not the table grapes you often buy in the store and snack on at home. Instead they taste like I believe concord grapes Its like how the reason that Banana flavour doesn't taste like the Bananas you can buy at the store, is because the flavouring was based on a now extinct species of banana.
Blue
Wait, but indigo is a flower and color independent of what you mentioned in this video. What the heck!?
I was always told blue raspberry was blueberry raspberry
Wait till Matt hears how fake the watermelon flavor is. Gonna have to redo the intro of this video.    But I love the fake watermelon flavor bc it's kinda unique. The color can be either blue, red or green with this monster.
i love Dan hahah whispers blue kills me hahahah
I’m curious why beyond meat products make my urine smell noticeably different
in australia we have a milkshake flavour call "blue heaven" it's the best
great video just perfect just amazeing
artificial grape tastes like cough syrup
I've just met that flavour today, and you drop that vid... Am i living in the simulation?
You guys are amazing, don't know how I only just discovered y'all
“now we know what licking Ariel would taste like” is not something I ever expected to hear matpat say
Mendela Effect
Blue
I'm very glad that someone else just calls the various similar flavors of the same hue "blue" and just lives with it.  Yeah, I'm sure it does drive others a bit mad—especially pedantic folks—but I don't think they realize that we had the same existential color/flavor crisis at one time; were just way further along in our journey of acceptance.
Blue
I thought it was common knowledge that Blue Raspberry isn't an actual thing but a flavour created by the market to sell a quirky flavour
grape flavored candy and soda are basically not sold in Sweden only exemption to soda is coca-cola freestyle machines.
Anybody internally go "AYOOOOOO?!" on that licking Ariel thing or am I the only one that needs cleansing?
I was always told that grape flavor was the flavor of children’s tears since most “child friendly” medicine is grape flavored for some reason.
I am old enough to remember when Blue MnMs first became a thing... Funny thing is, I BARELY remember tan MnMs 😂
Actually blue raspberry is a member of the Blackberrys because it's similar or the same flavor as this artifical flavor it's real just not how it seems -_-
I would love for him to do a video on what exactly makes up the flavor of "birthday cake"
Can we do something about being hungover in the morning? What food should and should not eat before and after, and many more that you are gonna find out
I actually associate a darker, almost wine red color to raspberry. Because of me eating Haribo when I was a kid. Strawberry is a lighter red, and raspberry is more saturated.
Idk how many other people have seen this but matpat sir you have left out the blue gummy bear myself and a few friends have had a blue gummy bear and mind you with no research just assumed it was just rare but as blue was the subject of this video was that just a dye issue that made them blue or are they actually a rare occurrence because my friends and I cannot identify the flavor of this blue gummy bear can you shed some light on this also yes otter pops lore video
im literally obsessed with the taste of grape candy and drinks but in my country we don't have them alot so when i see one i will literally buy the entire stock 😭
Even if i don't understand anything in these types of videos , i still love watching it
I swear I saw this video 2 years ago
this looks like a meme but sounds like something serious
do the ottor-pops lore video
play "Im blue"
In Spain Blue Raspberry flavour doesn't exist, the few products that are blue colored here are usually Tropical fruits flavour. There's literally a non-alcoholic licour flavour that is called Blue Tropic and it's a radioactive blue color.
We need otter pops lore
I cracked when matpat used that voice talking about the octopus 😂
Matt was completely unhinged in this video
What if MatPat was told that grape 🍇 was Purple Guy flavored, would it start tasting like remnant and regret?
Anyone remember Pepsi Blue? Didn't taste much, but you paid for the experience.
HO BOY! I sure love blue~!
Say blue a few too many times and the song is going to get stuck in my head again. Please don't.
Otter pop lore! Otter pop lore! Otter pop lore!
Dan's snow cone flavour is just ice and blue dye...he's not wrong.
In Australia, the flavour "cherry" isnt all too that popular, and nor is Blue Raspberry. Instead, we have raspberry for red, strawberry for either red or pink, grape for purple (duh), and either red or green for watermelon. We also don't see too much green apple flavours usually its just lime
I would love to see a video on artificial and alternative sweetners and why our full flavor sodas and drinks are adding more sweeteners that aren't sugar or corn syrup. I have a sensitivity to all of the ones I've tried (sucralose, aspartame, stevia, saccharin, and xylitol to name a few.) With sucralose being the worst offender for being put into regular items like soda, energy drinks, and gum. Even one pice of gum containing it causes me bad intestinal issues. Three sips of a drink containing stevia had me out of work for three days after being sent home.
The banana flavor is supposed to taste like a type of banana called big Mike which got whipped out from Panama disease. Whereas artificial grape flavor is supposed to be from concord grapes.
Im blue da bu dee da bu da
I once overheard someone talking to his friend about how nobody likes blue gummy bears (and other gummy things) because they're unnatural for a few long minutes. The look on his face when I told him blue was my favourite was excellent.
blue
4:32 😳🥵 I take 6 of them
Welp get ready for otterpop theories
No one? Ok How mwlvin introduces himself?  I am de groote
So many mentions of blue and not a single Dabadee Dabadie to be found.
Big Ambitions music in the background pog
Is it possible to artificially grow a blue raspberry plant?
Blueberry isn't blue. Its purple
Idea for a theorie, is there a way to optimised the place of the food in the fridge (some part are better to stock some type of food)

6:52 I NEED IT I NEED THE OTTER POPS LORE VIDEO AND I NEED IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THIS IS MY FIRST TIME EVER EVEN HEARING ABOUT OTTER POPS 🤣 PLEASE MATPAT TELL ME THE OTTER POPS *big inhale of air* LOOOOOOOORRREE
Please do.
I thought Grape flovered things were supposed to taste like the Concord grapes specifically, and I've only ever found concord grapes for sale once, and they had the taste....most grocery store grapes are different varieties that don't have the taste.
i never heard of blue rasberrys
Uutt
To quote Randy Feltface, BLUEBERRYS ARE FUCKIN PURPLE!
if you peel a blueberry they aren't even blue on the inside.
DO AN OTTER POP THEORY PLEASE
While watching that theory I was chewing on some sour patch kid gum from Trident, Red flavor specifically. What fruit flavor are they might you ask ? Well I'm from Quebec where protection of the French language is a law we have two lable on our dear Sour patch kid products, English side is "RedBerry" flavor, on the French side it says "Framboise rouge" that translates to red raspberry, So I was curious what the blue flavor would be ! Well in French the blue Flavor is Framboise Bleu... So yhea french people have two raspberry flavor as their canonical flavor for sour patch kid, not kidding look it up
3:10 glacier freeze>>>>> cool blue
i thought i was the only one who liked grape flavoured stuff
they just taste like rasberry
Ok so idk if it's a thing in the US, but here we have "Lambada" flavored snow cones EVERWHERE, which is a bright blue snow cone. Everyone knows it exists, everyone knows it's tasty, but NOONE knows what it tastes like (or what it's made of, which is tbh more important in my opinion). Is it the same as "Blue Rasberry"? Is it just rasberry flavored snow cones and someone put a weird name on it?
MATTPAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO POST COS I WANTED YOU TO SEE THIS,   PLEASE DO AN EPISODE ABOUT THE CORRELATION BETWEEN YELLOW MINIONS AND BANANAS 🙏🙏🙏 (My whole family has been hoping to see an episode like this and I was chosen to put the request in)
Taste like blue
Otter Pop lore! Yes please! 🍒🍊🍋🫒🫐🍇
Literally all I hear in the opening skit, ‘BLUEBERRIES ARE FUNKING PURPLE!’
Blue👍
ive been a blue raspberry lover since i was a kid, its my favorite artificial flavor lol. ive wondered what it was since theres no blue raspberries, but never looked it up, so this was helpful B)
Blue.
I’ve stopped saying flavors because they got too complicated now in just say the color it is  What are you drinking? Blue.
"Blue" -head editor Dan
in my country blue food is usually forest fruit flavor which is basically mix of different fruits that come from bushes

matpat seriously just went through all 5 stages of grief at the start
at least have the decency to call it “cool blue”
Funny clips 0:00 2:05 4:33
It tastes like sugar

ur just wrong. You can buy blue berries they are called Rubus blue. Have a good day
That’s cos the purple flavour is blackcurrant
we need otter pop lore
BLUE BERRY WOOHHHHHHH😮😮😮😮😮 MIND BLOWN COULD BLUE BERRY BE BLUE RASPBERRY???
4:05 BLUEBERRIES ARE F@#£ING PURPLE
Pink is also a solid flavor
Blue waffle.
If lies taste this good, I’m willing to ignore them
As a kid when ever I would think of blue raspberry I would think of blueberry’s mixed with raspberry for the flavor 😭
Yes, MatPat. Will you please do an Otter Pop Lore Theory? My grandson is 2 years and 2 months old. I could you the lesson. Thank you.
Dan in the intro is mood
Otter Pop Lore, PLEASE

If I Have To Be Honest, When I See Blue Sweets I Immediately Think It's Going To Be Sour As Much As Lemonade
Blue is blue, If blue is blue then it taste like blue
Please don't make an otter pop theory. No one knows what an otter pop is
Head Editor Dan woke up today and chose violets.
For me, blue raspberry snow cones doesn't exist, for me the blue flavour is called 'Godzilla' and it just tastes like sugar
2:04 jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference jojo reference
wait matpat pan flag what
blue
WAIT!!! Are you saying the snosberry really DOESN’T taste like snosberry?!? BLASPHEMY!!!!!
There are literal blue raspberries growing nearby my house
matpat saying "blue pigments" while showing a bue butterfly must be the biggest mistake in all theorist channels, (blue butterflies arent blue because of pigment they're blue cuz off micro  structures that trap every wavelength except blue)
0:31 blue raspberry is not a real thing he says with blue raspberry on his snowcone
You all do know there are some colors you cannot recreate right??? Yellow, blue, red. Our eyes use these colors to distinguish other colors. If you done believe me…go out and buy some paint…try to make yellow without yellow or red without or blue without blue
I hate blue
i allways thought it was blueberry razberry
Actually the grape flavour does taste like grape, just not the commercial normal one that everyone buys. The grape flavour is modeled after a different type of grape
When we were little, my cousin's favourite ice cream flavour was a pastel blue ice cream named Blue Sky. I only got to taste it when I went to college 'cuz I grew up in the middle of nowhere. It was just a mild, kinda sweet ice cream. Like the closest I could describe it is cotton candy but less sweet
I always thought it was “blueberry and raspberry” flavoring. Huh. It’s my fav flavor, I’ll usually pick it over anything (other than some good watermelon flavoring, if done right.
As my fav comedian once said “BLUEBERRIES R F***ING PURPLE!” ~randy feltface
I think he mean zooper doopers instead whatever otter pops are
What about blueberry are they the same thing
Like in the jaws of life?
blue poweraid + whole milk = strawberry Nesquik. I sh*t you not!!! try it out. will blow ur mind.
blue flavor is my favorite
The whole licking Ariel thing... sir, this is a family channel. but. you had me at licking Ariel.. LOL
If you break otter pops in half it just come open no need to use your mouth learned that from a tictok
While I enjoyed their music, gotta admit this does nothing for expanding the listening audience to the Indigo Girls
It's been a pet peeve of mine that blue raspberry doesnt taste like raspberry. I still love the flavor, but its not raspberry.
I feel like this man could convince us to do anything at this point like he could make a video saying eat carbord and i would just go *vacuum cardboard*
OTTERPOP LORE
I thought  blue raspberry  was just the mix taste of Blueberries and raspberry
How let Head Editor Dan Cook?
But grape does taste like grape.  Specifically Concord grapes.
Best blue drinks? Those made out of butterfly pea flowers!
in judaism, the color blue/turqoise is cocidered holly :)
It’s so entertaining that this video features a uniquely American Problem, in Europe there is not blue raspberry , raspberry is just lighter than strawberry
The fact I’m eating blue raspberry sorbet rn💀💀
Blue berries are PURPLE   -randy feltface
You forgot about blueberry
Dave chapell sugar water and purple
If blue can't be a flavor then I can't say my favorite Gatorade without being a cop
I still prefer Blue raspberry and sour green apple flavored stuff
0:22 *blue*
bloo.
Is this an American thing cause where i live any blue coloured stuff is blueberry flavour so... idk but great video as always!
Greatest intro of this channel
Dan the Pokémon  catchphrase : blue
So you’re telling me, not only is there color theory… but there is also color food theory?!?! I think we need a series ❤️
Still best flavor
Matpat might I quote the comedian Randy Feltface in your stance on Blueberries being blue "BLUEBERRIES ARE F***ING PURPLE"
If you sat me down and said “learn this learn that”  and made me watch this I would have the thing you wanted done finished in 10 seconds 😅
I said blueberry 💀
PLEASE DO A OTTER POP LORE VIDEO!!!
Matpat whenever he see's something "Blue raspberry" flavor: "Why are you blue?"
6:52 Yes.
Fun fact: Australia doesn’t have blue raspberry sour patch kids
That intro was chef's kiss
I. Just wanted to  make  …
Mandala effect 😂
I am surprised you didn't make this earlier, I already knew this but I'ma see your take.
.
Why hate grape? I like grape
For that matter, what flavor is bubblegum supposed to be?  Now, it’s itself, but was it always?
We have no blue raspberry anything in my country. Maybe cuz its super artificial lmao.
blue raspberry is the best flavor, because it tastes exactly what we think the color blue would taste like
FYI, Gatorade also has a Blue Cherry, but the tartness of the Cool Blue is nice.
I know it's a brand name but God...! No! They are not Otter Pops! They are called Freezies! I will not debate this!
I always thought blue raspberry was blueberries and raspberries together
Scrolling down my list of vids on the right,I realized there is BLUE In every thumb nail
wasn't blue raspberry blackberry and coconut?
Idk blue raspberry tastes fine to me
There's even freaking song about blue
Did anyone actually think blue raspberry’s were a thing 😂
Blue is blueberry, not ‘blue raspberry’
Sir Isaac Lime is the best otter pop.
Just make blue things taste like blueberries Edit: ohhhh I get it now Edit: I don't get it why is it chemicals
When Matpat showed that blueberry I had to think of that one Randy Feltface line: BLUEBERRIES ARE FUCKING PURPLE
my mom, rest her soul, never cared for any blue raspberry candies because she always said they always had a gross chemical-y flavor, and i've only ever had cool blue gatorade because i was trying to associate the colors with COD zombies perk a cola drinks
Blue
Here I am having thought it was Blue Berry + Raspberry flavor.
Matpat forgot about blueberries
yes, you should do an otter pops theory, there not in my country but i still want it
Water is *actually* inherently slightly blue. That's why pools and more vividly the ocean looks deep looks blue. Its no different from anything else blue. Disappointed by your statement at 1:30. What do you think color is exactly? What do you think pigments are? Expected better from your channel tbh.
Blueberry
I had never heard of blue raspberry flavour before this video where I'm from blue was always said to be blueberry flavour
If u eat Ariel is that cannibalism or seafood? 🤔
Banana flavor is good too, but it definitely doesn't taste one
until i watched this video, i though blue raspberry was a real fruit
I always say they are Blueberry XD
I saw Food Theory: The CORRECT Way To Build A Burger! And I think you should redue it but put 2 slices of cheese on 1 on top and 1 on the bottom of the burger so that you can taste the cheese more. It might give you a different taste ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJskYagyhjE )
I have never eaten raspberries before so i was wonder why “blue raspberry” tastes kinda odd
I want that otterpop lore theory matpat
I always knew it was just chemicals but they some yummy chemicals
PLEASE DO AN OTTER POP LORE THEORY I WOULD CRY
If dan got blue flavored and blue flavor is fake ?        Dose that means he got the Imposter flavor?
The intro is back wooo
fun fact: despite being called an acid, the ph of malic acid is actually has a ph of 7.0
We def need more of Dan😂
Is this video a joke I mean we all know it’s not a fruit it’s an artificial flavour 💀
shy cant we just say blueberry (I said this before watching the video so if something happens then whatever)
Otter pop lore :O
Blue.
No but I actually have thought that my whole life that blue raspberry was a mixture of the flavors of blueberries and raspberries. My life has been turned on it’s head
Actually, grape flavored things do taste like grape, but a specific species. It tastes like Concord grapes which I only know because Japan is real big on grape juice from those grapes and people have a consciousness of different varieties of grapes. I was really shocked tasting it for the first time, but also it's one of my favorite juices now. The US on the other hand tends to grow monocultures of everything cuz capitalism, but that also makes most Americans ignorant of how different grapes taste. Most places sell green or red seedless exclusively cuz basically we're lazy and don't wanna deal with seeds, but there's more types. I also have learned Muscats are too sweet for me.  This is very much like the banana flavor problem because stuff tastes like the gro michele but not modern bananas.
Not that far along, but if I remember, they wanted raspberry as a flavor but wanted a diffrent color as they already had cherry, strawberry, and water melon as red. The flavor is closer to waterbark raspberry but if I remember it's a completely fake, synthetic flavor.
"Licking Ariel" -MattPat
6:11 bros if you didn't know you can just snap the otter pop in half you don't need to use teeth to open it (take in note they have to be frozen enough to snap)
It's amazing how, in the opening bit, Matpat gives Dan such a hard time about saying his flavor is 'Blue,' then at the end goes on about how we've been "fooled" into thinking these artificial flavors taste like the real thing when, news flash, _we haven't._ That's _why_ we call the artificial colors "purple drink," "blue drink," etc. We _know_ they're not real.
the grape bit at the beginning is good because here in the UK grape isn't a common flavour as we have blackcurrant instead
I taste colours.... 😂
The intro just made me think of that Liar Liar scene.  MY SNOWCONE IS BLUUUEEEEEE, IT’S BLUEEEEEEEE!
I personally think the cool blue Gatorade tastes like mandarin oranges
Blue raspberries do exist, you just have to put blue food colouring on normal raspberries to make them.
Once this happened with a friend Friend: what snow cone did you get? Me: blu Friend: you can't taste color Me: *shows her a post about how flavors got assigned to colors and that's how you taste color* Friend: *heavy breathing*
Must be an American thing. Here in germany raspberries are red. 🤔
And if you live here in Texas you can get a soda named big blue it's delicious
I always thought “Blue Raspberry” was a cross of Blue Berry and Raspberry. A better video idea would have been fake grape flavoring. The Ben and Jerry story of why they don’t make grape ice cream.
When I was young my dad told me that blue ice cream was made from the magic from the smurfs
There actually is a kind of grape that tastes just like grape candy flavor- I love those
Lol…we were literally talking about this tonight. Literally told someone that blue raspberry isn’t real. It’s just a fake flavor.
grape taste like purple
Idiot no bomino
blue also is the most named anime  blue lock, blue flower, blue dragon, etc.  japan REALLY love blue
Blue is totally a flavor
Wow all i know is strawberry better not be lie, or else ima do something REAL bad not gonna lie
Licking Ariel 👀
guys, why do bees like dandemilon when it tastes like flower, soda and bitter???
I know what blue raspberry is: it's f*king delicious
More accurately blue raspberry act is usually called fruit punch
Come on, everyone, chant with me. "Otter pop lore. Otter pop lore. Otter pop lore!"
Bluuueeee
otter pop lore ❤
Even Blue Wine Exists😱
This is an actual question I have had for years. Thanks matpat
Just as MatPat said guess we know what licking Ariel tastes like
I always thought blue raspberry was another name for bramble…
Blue is a flavor.
Hi Dan, blue
4:04 *takes a deep breath* BLUEBERRIES ARE F**KING PURPLE!!!
Can't wait for the Otter Pops lore video. Will it cover any character rosters in off-brand Otter Pops? Did those even attempt to create characters? I must know!
6:08  I think you're supposed to snap them in the middle
Concord grapes taste like grape flavor
It’s not blue raspberry it’s blueberry
blue raspberry >>>>>>>>>
Dan had gamersubs
Oh no..."I always thought Ariel would taste like  the saltiness of the ocean." Ugh, just ugh on so many levels.
ROMANS 1:16✝️"FOR I AM NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST FOR IT IS THE POWER OF GOD FOR SALVATION TO EVERYONE WHO BELIEVES" ✝️❤️
Romans 10:9 "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved"
John 15:18 “if the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first”💕✝️
I can't be the only person who that blue raspberry was blueberry and raspberry
I always throught blue rasberry was blueberry and rasberry combined
Hehe I'm toxic
Thanks for adding that bit at the beginning, gives us a chance to meet all of your theory crew.
Not to mention that all banana candy is made to resemble the flavor of a species of banana that no longer exists...
100% support an otter pop lore video!
nor true ahrine wan't first artificial sweetner Lead was used as an artiicial sweetner since ancient times.
There was a tree in my neighborhood that had whitebark rasberries. I always assumed that was where blue rasberry flavor came from
Am I the only one that noticed that there's new music in food theories videos
We do have yellow raspberries though or something not red
the more i watch food theory the more i feel that its more of an infographic than an actual theory
Love cool blue but glacial freeze is the better gatorade
Blue flavor is best flavor.
I’ve never eaten anything blue raspberry. Raspberry candy is red/pink here (Europe)
Randy feltface on blue dyed foods 🤣🤣 almost identical to this video energy wise
I’m glad I can find a fellow grape enthusiast, we must stand strong brotha, we must fight the other evil flavors.
Grape flavoring tastes like Concord grapes
I couldn't help but notice the pansexual flag colors on mats snow cone
There are a few questions yet to be answered from your doors theories one of those is that void has been replaced by glitch.
Hue-manity smh
As a European I never understood why blue things aren’t blueberry (or maybe blackberry if you take it as dark blue)
It’s blue berry
We dont really get raspberry flavoured stuff in South Africa but we do get blue coloured foods but they are usually called mountain mist or something similar. I drink blue Poweraid because I like the flavour the best but I cant tell you what flavour it is it has a mixed berry or mixed fruit flavour I think but I'm not sure but its called mountain breeze what does that mean
see you have finally destored my childhood
Chikn nuggit theory please
Blue is indeed a flavor and its my absolute favoritest flavors. Dan i completely understand you 💙
blue
"Melvin is often considered to be the second greatest American inventer behind Thomas Edison."   What about Nicola Tesla
"What does blue taste like?" "Blueberri-" "Blue raspberries?" 🗿
that cherrananape favor is pretty good though
I need that grape video.
I just want sour patch Swedish fish
*blue*
I see Dan was inspired by sody pop
i personally would love to see an otter pops lore theory
Wait what I thought it was blue flavor is blue berry I didn’t even know what blue raspberry existed
Eeeew grape. 😂
YES we need an otter pop lore video plleaaaasssseee
I've never seen blue raspberry as a flavor here in Finland. It just doesn't exist. If something is blue, it's definitely going to be blueberry flavor.
Odd, I hate Grapes and bananas fruit or candy but blue ras has always been my favorite
Blue
...Thomas is the fraudster ain't he?
Solid proof that Dan is a pokemon who has been given a nickname 👍
Do a food theory on the terribleness that is colored dyes
That opening joke is exactly what I say when I get slushies. Blue is best flavour, fight me! And also yes, otter pop lore would be fun to hear
I know you were naming loads of poisonous blue things in nature, but where I come from, in Malta, we have a very common plant called Borage (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borage), which is in fact not only not poisonous, but, at least the flowers (I'm not sure about the rest) are edible. Mainly it is just eaten when random people find it on walks, but some people make tea and soup with it.
When I was a child, the most popular ice cream in our area was blue, called "smurf icecream". It tasted like the lemon icecream.
PLEASE do an episode on the flavor “Bubblegum”
If you mix 2 to one blueberries and raspberries you can get a pretty close blue raspberry jam though it's really closer to a light purple in color  Edit you do need a good bit of lemon zest in there for the sour notes
😂😂😂😂 this video is a joke
Bros never had good grapes, them bois sweet.
Blue Raspberry is the flavor, it's just not based on a real fruit
My blue raz now has a hint of banan -_-
If you drink enough of the cool blue Gatorade, it starts tasting like sunny d
But i love blue raspberry omg
Blue is best flavor
Ya know whats funny bananas are berries
💙 I've always wondered about this exact topic.
Blue.
idk i associate blue with sadness and blues songs
But then what is Italian Caramel ?
GUNS!
"You couldn't use purple, that's for grape.".  You mean blackcurrant.  Blue is either blueberry or bubblegum.
Cool Blue is a citrus flavored drink 100%
Okay now I'm curious whether or not he can actually come up with lore for otter pops.
4:29 Ay yo? What you mean by that? 🤨
I think I’ve always thought about it but never thought to look up what blue raspberry is. I figured it was just like some genetically altered raspberry or something but interesting to know their wasn’t even actual raspberries in the making at all. 🤔😮
Should do an episode on Tizers flavour of; Is red but tastes purple.
I always assumed when Americans were talking about blue raspberries they actually meant blackberries. 😅
What about blue jays and peacocks and others birds with blue using the color to attract mates and not as a warning
I know blue raspberry is a fake flavor, but it still doesn't stop it being my favorite flavor ^_^
Blue
Umm, actually, grape flavor is taken from concord grapes. Hank Green told me so
Thomas Edison wasn't an inventor.
Now I need an explanation for the flavor of Pink, especially on donuts. Because it's definitely not strawberry like it supposedly should be, and it's not just food coloring and vanilla icing.
The flavor is blue just like red is the best kool-aid flavor
Nice video ❤
I like to say blue raspberry is both the most and least accurate artificial flavor, because the real fruit doesn't exist for us to compare it to...
I learned something about acotar in this video
I call it "blue lemonade"
Don't forget banana flavor doesn't taste like bananas
In the words of Randy Feltface: "BLUEBERRIES ARE F***ING PURPLE!*
You know those times you try to take grape medicine but your gag reflex kicks in and you are unable to swallow it.
Dan has shown that he is truly an enlightened being by refusing to conform to arbitrary flavors and chooses to consume colors themselves.
It’s funny, when I was growing up, me and every other kid steered clear of “blue flavored” stuff because it was the worst flavor. 😅
1:40 pointing at a butterfly is the worst option for "natural blue", as butterflies typically have structural blue (nm scale structures that reflect only blue light)
Blueberry?
Blue is the correct best flavor. I'm 39 seconds in and Dan is already on the right path. The rest of the video? Screw it. Blue is supreme.
Real grapes are ok. Artificial grape flavor though... soooo gooood
My father and i debate what blue raspberry flavor is supposed to be on a regular basis lol Its my favorite "fruity" candy flavor so its inevitable.  Also Editor Dan's "It Blue" response to Matpat's interrogation is perfect
MatDonalds looks very trust worthy 10/10 would eat there💯💯
Blue flavor is ALWAYS the best. And no, it doesn’t need to taste like something that exists.
Why am I craving a blue raspberry now 😂
MatPat's life at this point is making more theory vids and buying a mew Bugatti
Grape candy is made to taste like concord grape, which is a very strong flavor, unlike boring table grapes.
BLUE
As someone that loves Raspberries and is allergic to Red Food Coloring I 100% appreciate this complete lie =p
Blueberries are purple... The skin is a dark blue but it's insides are purple matpat...
5:17  Yeah that's what I thought the flavor was (also i just realized that the english name for them if pretty stupid and long...)
When I worked at World Market around 10 years ago, they one day started selling these bags of blue gummies shaped like feet. A lady came up to me and asked what flavor they were, but as they had just come out with them, I didn't know. "Let's find out," I said, and went to the shelf to grab the blue gummy feet bag, turned it over, and... *Flavor: Blue*
I don't care what anyone says blue = mint
not a hot take
Lmao when I was really young I always just called the flavour “blue”, and since it was my fav colour it didn’t really matter to me what it tasted like 😂
well yeah its not a real fruit but its still the best flavor
blooooo
I am so ready for a full otter pop episode
I have to agree with your editor - just as orange is a color and a flavor, blue is a color and a flavor.  (It's not like you have a better name for that particular synthesis *anyway*, might as well just say it's blue flavored :-)
The reason grape flavour doesn't taste like grapes is because grapes (the fruit) don't taste like the most common grape (concord) when they invented the artificial flavour. Making grapes better for shipping and seedless took away all the flavour.
Isn’t blue raspberry a legit flavor. It’s Blue berries mixed with raspberries so they call it blue raspberry for short.🤷🏻‍♂️
We need a candy company to have a full set and have both 'blue razz' and 'true razz'
9 h.
Grape isn't grape flavored? You're going to go up against Hank Green, now?
Sorry matpat everyone  knows blue is a real flavor. just like when talking about kool-aid red is the best flavor.
PLEASE MAKE AN OTTERPOP LORE VIDEO
I am drinking a blue sour patch kids soda
The flavour of blue is sugar
Do the otter pop vid
SHUT UP AND LET THEM JUST MAKE SOMETHING WITHOUT THEORISING IT! WHEN I MAKE SOME KIND OF FOOD THEN D O N T E V E N T H I N K A B O U T I T
Yes, we know.
Wait, style theory? 5th channel confirmed?
I really appreciate the closed captioning, thank you. I know it's easy to let youtube generate it but it's nice to see a content creator go out of their way and do it themselves (helps when there's a script to be sure, but still appreciated)
Wow, I always wondered why so many cheap sodas tasted almost the same, despite being advertised as different flavors, I am immune to the mix up of color and flavor.
blue.
I think we all knew this
Wait I literally just thought about you doing a theory about it like 3 days ago
I need that mermaid pudding
Dan is not only an integral part of ythe theorist team, I firmly belive is the one keeping Mat from going full haywire with his editing skills, and is so, so memeable
BLUEBERRIES ARE NOT BLUE!! BLUEBERRIES ARE PURPLE!!!!
I always assumed blue raspberry flavor was just raspberry flavored item with blue color.
I already knew this. Food chemistry is absolutely bonkers when combined with corporate intrest and ad firms.
Matt, like grape flavored candy, explains everything, LOL 😆 I can't do anything grape flavored unless it's from actual grapes.
Great video to crack open my blue flavoured rockstar energy as I'm about to go bring my nephew to the ice cream shop to eat some blue flavoured ice cream since I'm the best babysitter
You could also do why the artificial banana flavoring tastes nothing like bananas
actually, a collective video explaining all the "fake" flavors would be pretty cool--not just grape, but also why the banana flavor doesn't taste like bananas... _anymore..._ anyone who wants, chime in if YOU know why that is, too ;)
they taste like blue
Cool blue tastes cool 🥶🥶🥶😎😎😎
If im not mistaken Blue Raspberry is called Cassis in Germany which is a pretty popular flavor there as well. I never liked Blue Ras just because it doesn't taste anything like Raspberry. I love Raspberries, Raspberry Jam, actual Raspberry Candy but miss me with that Blue Junk xD
I have never heard of blue raspberry in my life until today.
I'm going to chemically construct a blue raspberry to prove you wrong Matt Pat
ROMANIA ICE CREAM FLAVOURRR xD
Blue.
Grape flavor is based off concord grapes not table grapes
Also the absolut best way to open an otter pop, is break it in half across the wider point in the cylinder, there is the axis with the labels and you would think to fold it along that line, dont, rather fold snap it along the seam, it works every time
Orange 🍊 for me please.
I swear it was on this channel, but grape flavor is meant to taste like a specific type of grape, Concord grapes.
It’s blueberry, blueberry
... so, the snozzberries don't taste like snozzberries?!?
But blue raspberry exists doe? It’s just not that flavor at all
Ok but now I genuinely want an otter pop lore video!!! 😮 please do this
I just assumed it was a sad attempt at a blueberry raspberry mix.
hehe amaranth
Okay, I'm gonna derail for a moment. Didn't Sally Jackson have Percy ask Zeus to light up the top of the empire state building blue so she'd know he was okay? Did that have anything to do with that thing about m&ms in the 90s?
What about how most 100% juices are just flavored apple juice
Nilered or was it Nilegreen used methalanthranalate to make a grape soda
Sorry Matt, but Dan's right. Blues flavor is Blue. It's Blue. Blue. Blue.  I will however claim that you are correct if you do in fact do an otterpop lore episode 😁
I love raspberries but absolutely hate blue raspberry flavored things so I thank you for this episode and showing that blue raspberry DOES NOT taste like raspberries. It really assures me 😊
Yo do you have one of you signature jackets in orange cuz I would spend up to $10,000 for one
I immediately remembered this bit from Randy Feltface's "Randy Writes a Novel" https://youtu.be/acPA-t7cD18
Blue.... blue...... BLLLUUEEE
Mountain Dew Voltage is blue and raspberry flavored
Blue raspberry is the biggest lie in the candy industry, it's not even a real fruit. I bet if you searched for it on Google, it would just redirect you to a Smurf fan page.
I will wait for the lore for Otter pops
Nice vidio it was intresting for me but did you know that there are yellow rasberris
he got blueberry flavor
To quote a specific purple puppet:  Blueberries are fucking purple.
This episode hit me like finding out rainbow paddle pops are just salted caramel flavour
Please do Otter-Pop lore! I remember always studying the boxes as a child and looking for every change. This might be rose-tinted nostalgia talking, but I could have sworn there were a lot of minor changes with the surrounding art
"I'm Blue da bu de da you die". Very cultured meme there😂
In brazil blue is "tutti frutti" so we just say it's a mix of every flavor
So fun fact grape flavor is a flavor of and actual grape it's a concord grape or a wine grape what everyone eats is known as a table grape cause it would be terrible as a wine
"BLUE FLAVORRRRR"
At the time of writing this, I'm still watching the intro, but I always thought that blue raspberry came about because food companies wanted to differentiate their raspberry-flavored items from their strawberry-flavored items and that's why they colored raspberry blue.
I only trust Head Editor Dan after that intro. I trusted Amy until she named the flavors :I
otto pop lore plz
People have blue eyes
4:32 Add another to the "MatPat out of context." List
Some of the best flavors are them industrial solvent blend flavors. A little ethyl butyrate, isobutyl acetate, maybe some limonene, a wee skosh of acetaldehyde, toss in a little rust remover, like phosphoric acid, for a bit of tang, and mwah, beautiful.
Grape flavoring does in fact taste like a real grape, they're called Concord grapes, and they have a similar (but not idenitcal) flavor profile, minus the ridiculous amounts of sugars
Isn’t blue raspberry just regular raspberry died blue?
I do love the flavor blue, i can share dans simple answer
Please do a theory on grape flavoring. I've taken to calling it just Purple because it doesn't taste like grapes to me and it's so strong. I can't eat purple. But I like grapes!
Meanwhile, Sweden waits for summer when we can pick, what we call, blue raspberries, or dewberries as you english speakers call them.
With the amount of times the word blue was said  in the cold open alone had made the word lose all meaning
Blueberry and raspberry combined
There is a blue raspberry V8 juice and it has blueberries and raspberries on the label, so Ive always assumed it’s a mixture of the two lol
A Food Theory on the best flavor ever? *PUTS ON HEADPHONES*
As a person with the name Blue this video is very entertaining. 👍
The butterfly doesn’t actually have a blue pigment. It looks blue based off how it’s wing’s lamellae refract light at the nanoscale.
Team grape!
6:44 no, matpat. They have FURsonas.  *behold the power of the furries😈*
That’s all fine and dandy but why is there a margarita flavor 🤨
The flavor blue is the flavor blue.  If i can say blue and people will think of the flavor then the flavor is blue.
Ironically enough when ever I go to Bahama Bucks I always get Blue Raspberry and Grape 😂
Sometimes I sit and wonder how truly unnatural some things are and wonder what it's impact is
Apparently Hank Green said that the candy grape is actually based around the concord grape which is sweeter and more flavorful than most grapes.
Blue is the superior flavor
I thought grape flavor tasted like Concord grapes?
Red 40 ain’t looking to good😭😂 wtf is up with red coloring why all the reds bad for you😂
Funfact where I live, blue rasberry never exists and blue is usually associated with bubblegum a lot or there was this flavor called vanilla blue
aren't grape flavored things specifically flavored to taste like concord grapes and not the ones people usually eat? Also banana flavor tastes like a different kind of banana that used to be more widespread before a shortage due to a plant disease.
Blue
I tend to like the things that are with red color.
I always wondered if blue raspberrys were real
very nice video
blue
blue
Ryan George needs to get on the Mermaid Splashes Snack Pack board room planning meeting ASAP!  He's got at least one character that really likes the gaps in bathroom stalls.  So licking mermaids would be right up his alley.
This is insane. I literally asked myself what blue raspberry was TO MYSELF in the car this morning on the way to classes. WHAT. MatPat strikes again
On My. Dew Voltage, they say it's normal raspberry, and blueberry.... Granted it doesn't taste like raspberry at all
As a blue thing I can confirm that this theory is true.
As a blue thing I can confirm that this theory is true.
Blue.
I swear wasn't there a theory on this that MatPat did already but somewhere else? Like I have a memory or something or misremembering or trippin idk
Grape flavoring in candies and other artificially grape flavored products are based on concord grapes and not normal table grapes, which you can prove by sticking a spoonful of concord grape jam in your mouth.
1:28 (ish)  isnt all color we see just how light is being reflected off surfaces?
Wait, how is this video not sponsored by that water bottle company‽
Randy Feltface asked this first, also blueberries are fucking purple!
Best intro ever 😂😂😂
Same I’ve always been more of a grape or green apple guy
3:28 He said the WORD blue and words are abstract nouns, so you can not taste blue!
Brayden can't have blue. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acPA-t7cD18
That M&M vote was definitely not fair. While purple is my favorite color, Purple and Pink are Primary colors, It is only natural Blue would win a vote
couldnt we just genetically make blue raspberries?
I have never ever heard about blue rasberries. Is this US thing?
It taste like blue #2. Im ok with that.
The flavor is BLUE!!!😂
I would enjoy an otter pop food theory video
Any drink or food with different colors, the flavor is just the color
That intro was amazing
Mat what is your fool name
"So what FLAY-VORE did you get, DAAAAN?" ".....Blue dabadidaberry."
Now I need to go get some of those blue not-raspberry and grape ice pops, those were my favorites as a kid.
I want to see a loterpop theory
Grapes are the OBJECTIVE BEST FRUIT

Blue
PLEASE LOOK INTO OTTERPOP LORE
That intro was the BEST!!!!!
We have a purple orchid at home that smells like perfumed baby powder(which has a grape-y scent too it also) It would start smelling rather pungent like after 3-4 days(a wee bit like pee actually, prolly the oil going rancid)
PLEASE PLEASE make an otter pop lore video
0:35 childish but funny 💀💀
Blue
Blue is the only answer, the grape is on edge because it should be purple flavored but that’s a different conversation
I always thought Blue Raspberry was a short way of saying Blue Berry mixed with Raspberry.
Blue is sugar flavor
"Now we know what licking Ariel would taste like..." sounds like a new Theory channel needs to be made!
BLUE!!!
I would be super keen for a grape flavour episode. Artificial grape is probably one of my favourite candy flavours but I have no idea what it actually is and would love to know!
Blue is good flavor
wait... blue isn't a shaved ice flavor?
matt's snow cone color in the beginning is the pansexual flag
Hi east coaster welcome to the western USA where local mountains and even cities cross the mile or two high mark. Deer the size of small trucks roam free, snow falls in mid July on random years and what’s that bramble growing are they raspberries that are the color of blueberries? Why yes they are. Try fact checking before posting Matt
"Now we know what licking Ariel tastes like"💀
Wise words of a purple comedian, Randy: "Bleaberries are fu....g purple!!".
I always thought that the detergent blue looks unnatural and even less appetising
Honestly suprised that no one mentioned anything about percy jackson yet
Oh yeah! I was tiny when red was associated with cancer, and my mom and gramma freaked out and tossed all our food coloring. I was so suprised, and everyone my age and younger so happy when RED colored candy, like M&Ms, came back! I forgot all about that.
Pleeeeeeaaaazzzze give oter pop lore
there is actually a way to make raspberries turn blue, i did it once with my mom we made this cake that was called a blue raspberry cake and i believed we used baking soda to make the raspberries turn blue somehow, so yea there is a way to get blue raspberries
hey matpat, grape flavor is actually similar to real grapes! specifically concord grapes. however in strange twist of fate, the flavor was originally derived from an orange blossom. it wasn't until years later they realized that flavor compound was actually in grapes.
Itss blue
I’ve been waiting for this video for years
I watch food theory while eating, and when  im done i still continue to watch it because im just to invested after eating
I need an otter pop lore episode now 😅
I’m sorry but is blue razz not blue berry AND raspberry flavor? Like?… hence the name?
So you’re telling me there is pudding that taste like fish😃🤢
Fun fact: there is a thing called red 40 and it's also toxic
5:14 technically vid gets going
We need a otter pop lore video now
0:25 IM BLUE DA BA DEE DA BA DIEEEE
Blue is very much a flavor.  Not blue raspberry, just "blue" and I have the popsicles to prove it. 👻
George Carlin wants his joke back.
I don't know if MatPat will read this ( cause I am ALWAYS late to the party ... )  but, thanks for making this video!   I have always wondered "why the heck is raspberry blue?!" SERIUOSLY.   I'm not being hyperbolic.   This has always bothered me.   ( ... and know I know! )
I miss red #2.
Blue Raspberry is my favorite flavor it might not be a flavor but it is my favorite
so blue raspberry is actually a chemical in raspberries that has that raspberr-iness. HOWEVER a single chemical does not a fruit make and thus it tastes nothing like one because it is only part of the story like all the aromatic compounds and other complexities of taste. Many fruits have a major flavour chemical that has the most fruitness of that fruit but lacks a lot of what I described above ie grape which is mostly floral and scent hence why grape flavour doesnt taste like it even though that chemical is identical. Heres Nilerad making Raspberry Keytone https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M_Yhlh2PTo&ab_channel=NileRed
Game theory there is lore in Geometry Dash
you just realized this?
*please* do an otter pop episode! I have spent a ridiculously large portion of my adult life trying to convince people they are actually thing. Like people are all familiar with the plastic tube popsicle things, but the name otter pop is completely lost. It's my own Mandela effect and I swear th mention of otter pops in this video is soul soothing.
Blue
Please do an otterpop lore video
Blue
I have no sense of smell. As a kid I didn't understand why people said different color candies had different flavors. To me they all tasted the same, except maybe green being more sour. I understand now that's because of the connection between smell and flavor. Seeing the break down of how the blue raspberry flavor mostly relies on aroma gave me a clearer understanding of why artificial fruit flavors don't work for me.
ayo... "licking ariel"? she 14 i aint going to jail.
Otter pop theory coming soon😂
grape doesn't taste like grape, grape tastes like purple
Food Theory Idea... Flavors... Seriously, what are they, especially the complicated flavors... and how do we recognize them?
I’d love a food theory on grape, also talk about banana  I’ve always been more into the red ones. The blue raspberry flavored things lost their charm for me years ago.
Who is going to tell MatPat that you can split the otter pops in half when thoroughly frozen?
Fun fact! The trolli sour gummy worm that is red and blue is cherry and grape not blue raspberry o.O mind blowing right?
When is style theory gonna have its own opening
I did not know there was a funky pop line of otter pops, now I must go the otters need me   *starts running away*  *far away* My People Need Me!
As the famous Randy Feltface once said: "BLUEBERRIES ARE F****N PURPLE"
Did anyone else not think blue raspberry was just a mix of blueberries and raspberries?
B L U  E  F L A V O R
otter pop LOREE
Its always intresting to see these theories stop at the US-borders.
Literally just bought a cool blue Gatorade I was wondering what blue really is
There were people who thought blue raspberries were real? I thought everyone knew it was just supposed to be blue-colored, raspberry-flavored.
Kinda already knew that flavor was a faker. However, give me Watermelon anything and I'm happy. Watermelon for Life.
THE BLUES  JESSEY!
I believe that blue is the most popular favorite color because of colorblind people. For red-green colorblind people, the most vibrant colors are yellow and Facebook blue, and for people with tritanopia, the most vibrant colors are red and sky-blue. I believe that the tendency of these people to choose blue as their favorite color is enough to make blue the most popular favorite color.
Blue taste like its sour and sweet at the same time
Ngl..I’d watch the OtterPop Lore video
Special blue froot loop was a thing too
In Hebrew we call the blue flavour "lambada" (because of the song) and it's the pear flavour.
🟦
I know nothing of this 'grape' you speak of. There is only purple.
This would’ve been a good video to have air up as a sponsor
Blueberries are purple not blue. I expected more from you flat pat.
gotta love blue flavor
Blue is by far my favorite color
4:30 AYO mat 🤨
Missed opportunity for an Airup sponsored video. Especially when you mentioned that people taste what they're told.
Blue
You need to do the otter pop lore I would 1000% watch
This explains why blue raspberry is one of my favourite flavours but I hate anything actually flavoured like raspberry.
Icee def way better
When you turn blue, it indicate you are in danger.
my favorite flavor is a lie
It’s a shame there aren’t a lot of actual raspberry options. Honestly one of my favorite fruits.
Honestly, purple is my favorite flavor of snow cones😂  And I would like to note that only cops know the true names of gatorades, so MatPat is a theory cop now.  :)
You can't lick Ariel, she's 16...
I thought that all the blue stuff is blueberry
4:04 To quote a purple Australian comedian puppet (Randy Feltface), “BLUEBERRIES ARE FRICKEN PURPLE!” Just replace the frick with its more well know counterpart.
Blue No 2 gives you green poo.
Orange soda doesn't taste anything like orange juice. For many years I've been mixing a drink I call the "plastic orange" which is a 50/50 blend of both. The resulting flavor tastes exactly the way I always thought a plastic orange looks like it should taste. Friends I've shared the drink with describe it as confusing, after finding it hard to mentally process both flavors at once.
I've licked an Ariel once, tasted more like tuna with a hint of strawberries.
6:14 these things were disgustingly good
One thing always wondered(it might make a good theory), why is Apple flavoring always associated with green apples, yet the most common apple packaging is red?  I mean there's green apples, yes, but I feel like that's not reason. It just doesn't make sense.. (I might be wrong tho.
Meow
All I can think of now is Randy Feltface saying blueberries are purple
Isn't Amaranth a twitch streamer, or am I trippin?
Because blueberries are not tasty and they don’t really have one either other then mushy watery and well they usually don’t feel fresh
Grape flavor is gross. And I eat bugs.
There's a Blueberry Cream Soda (Blueberry+Vanilla flavours) that strongly reminds me of blue raspberry flavour. If you're drinking Minsha's Blueberry Cream and it tastes familiar, that might be what it is.
does blue paint really smell like red paint?
Blue berrys are purple
If you get yourself some good grapes they taste pretty close to grape flavor, actually. The concord grapes in northwestern Pennsylvania have my heart
Do an episode on if all skittles taste the same
just today I just got a *blue* snowcone
Dude, i actually cant believe that with all the genetic modification technology that we have today that no one made actual blue rasberries
Is VeggieTales film or food theory
Lmao I just love how head editor Dan is just flat out Messing with Matt hahaha XD Dan: blue!
The real question is how can we genetically modify raspberries to create blue raspberries that taste just like the flavor? Because that is a billion dollar idea if someone can make it happen.
I'd contest that grape doesn't taste like grape. I used to think that until I got my hands on some actual concord grapes and, honestly, it's pretty accurate.
My mom ban blue food in our house because of the mess it makes. I'm in my 20's now and still avoid it out of habit.
bruh i thought blue rasberry was harvested fresh from the vine then transported to a facility to become falvoring
Bluuuuuuuuuu
I do not care if it is completely artificial or made up, I love blue raspberry.
In Australian candy we have raspberry flavour for red so blue is blueberry.
Grape flavor is just tasting like what the color purple would be not what actual grapes taste like
"blue." "?!" "iz blue" i feel this in my soul
Nice new image, Dan.
Eiffel65 reference👍
BLUEBERRIES ARE F*CKING PURPLE!!! - Randy Feltface
Gigachad: I don’t care as long as it tastes good
Ok, now I really need a video on Cherry flavour and Ranch flavour. Two insanely popular flavours in America that, so far as I can see, are not even heard of in most of the rest of the world. What are they? Why are they so popular in the USA? And why have they not proliferated to the rest of the world?
Not only did I see a blue belly lizard the other day, but I also saw a blue Jay, and a blue dragonfly today.
Dan's narration method is much better than MatPat's
As someone who Alco calls most flavors by their color, I appreciate Dan adamantly saying "Blue"
Growing up, I thought blue raspberry was a mix of blueberries and raspberries.
0:02 Romania! 🇷🇴
Interesting that the butterfly you used to talk about rare blue pigments don't actually contain blue pigments. It, along with a lot of blue in nature, specially in insects, are a fruit of special crystal structures that traps other colors and reflect only blue, but are not pigments in a way that they aren't a molecule that have the property of reflectig blue. Btw, I see those butterflies all the time where I live and they are gorgeous.
taste like your mom
Blue
MatPat I love you. But "artificial" grape. Does taste like grapes. Just not like the most common grape, "Table Grapes". Check it out. Simular case with banana flavoring. 😅
Grape flavored stuff is appalling
"Red in peace"
I think blue raspberry’s taste like blueberry’s and raspberry’s, it just makes sence
about the otter pop flavors, the character names are wordplay based on real people/well known characters, the orange one is an orphan because it is a reference to little orphan annie if i’m not mistaken
I never drink anything blue... Turns me green.
9:47 How do you get 900 patents without being a millionaire? Foul play? Or government & such was the real investor? especially with chemicals which are undiscovered or concoctions which are usualy labeled as Top Secret & not allowed to be publicly patented. I assume he was the head of some multi billion dollar corporation?
Blue
I 100% want a food theory episode based on the lore of otter pops now, please make this MatPat!
4:54 raspberries are not berries 🤓
Itz blue
That intro is amazing
Please do an Otter Pop lore theory!
Like to vote that MatPat should do an otter pop lore theory
well the problem with flavoring on very processed stuff is that they put in various ingredients like you said that don't constitute anywhere close to the full list of ingredients, it's like comparing vanillin with vanilla, so if you think vanillin is close enough to vanilla then you have to concede that blue raspberry is close enough to raspberry. it's all a matter for personal taste i suppose.
Blueberries are actually purple As are a ton of "blue" foods
blue tastes the best
Blue
i miss the game theory intro
blueberry raspberry mix, i was under the impression thats what it was and that it was common sense
Da Baby approves 🥵🥵🥵
a short series of all the household flavors and what they’re popular in and used for could be a great series. like grape like matpat suggested, then watermelon, sour apple, “yellow” etc. could really pop off tbh
Hmmm how bout blue lemonade
"Blue raspberries aren't real!"  Did anyone ever assert that they were? It's raspberry flavor. And it's blue. It's not a mythical fruit, they just elected to make it a different color. Probably because there are already so many red flavors. Cherry, watermelon, strawberry, etc etc etc. Nothing was blue. So blue raspberry.  Maybe you'll get to a point soon. I'm only 5 minutes in. But so far it seems like an argument about something that nobody was actually speculating about :P
Mark was right and said this in a matter of seconds in a video but of course the whole journey is fun to see and hear
Did you know grass tastes like green appels
It's mostly due to the raspberry beret.
man this theory is making my brain melt also i tased blue color soda i dont not remember the flavor which is strange
New Mandela effect just dropped, blue raspberry
I woulda wanted a purple mnm :(
What does bubblegum taste like? What even is that flavour?
4:30 someone needs to add this into an out-of-context MatPat video
The intro is wrong, grape flavor isn't grape flavor, all grape flavored drinks n' stuff aren't grape flavored, they are purple flavored :).
Blue
Strawberry, watermelon and coconut!!! I thought I was the only one who liked this combo. I always get the same exact combo at the shaved ice place.  Edit: but I refuse to drink any alcoholic beverage that comes in blue. This is due to spending time, partying a little too hard at age 18 in a few TJ bars on Revolution. I'll never forget them blue Hawaiians... in a baddddd way. Don't under age drink in a foreign country, kids.
BLUE IS A F*CKING FLAVOR
THE INTRO IS BACK!!!1!
I would argue that in the combination of flavors that they succeed in capturing the absolute tart flavor of a ripe raspberry.., great now I got that tingle on the sides of my tongue and no raspberries in sight.  Green was a logical choice for apple because those ones are tart like Granny Smith apples. …, Dang it, it is the middle of the night I am out of fruit 😭
Personally I can't think about the taste of sour without thinking about green they are completely connected in my mind because it felt like most sour stuff like sour apple was green growing up.
I'm at the start of the video so I don't know yet if it is that, but in french, sometimes we call it "framboise blueue" wich is blue raspberry, but sometimes we call it "mûre" wich is blackberries.
Oh, you just KNOW Dan had a lot of fun with that opening bit.
hey @matpat please do the otterpops lore, I now want to see where that rabbit hole goes.
Do a video on pink lemonade vs regular
i thought it was raspberry flavored and just colored blue
*ActuAlLY mY VanIlA FlaVOreD cAndY waS BlUe*
blueberries don't have blue juice by the way. it's purple.  more red than blue, really.
I have hypersensitives, I’m convinced the blue shell on M&Ms is sweeter than the other  colors but, that might be down to the dye they use.
Dan at the beginning is just 110% relatable
Me actually having an Alexander the Grape funko pop: 👀
Are you going to talk about how “grape” flavor tastes closer to grape juice and why grape juice tastes different than grapes?
Blue raspberry = blue berry + raspberry Tart like raspberry. Sweet like blueberries.
Isn't watermelon flavor sometimes actually peach
I kinda always wanted to know what the heck my favourite flavour actually is.
bro started as a snowcone flavor arguement then an exestental crisist
Cool blue Gatorade is tangerine
11:00 when I saw this frame I got scared for a moment.
as a similar sort of idea, a theory about species of bananas could be cool   Just the general stuff about the common banana species being changed due to threats is interesting enough, and as a related thing, i've heard that supposedly banana candies are often based on flavors that were designed to taste like a species of banana that has since become far less common, hence why they taste a bit off. I have no idea if that's true or not though
"BLUE BERRIES ARE F*CKING PURPLE!"
Can you do a lore video on the goldfish commercials that have 6 seasons of connected advertisements?
lol the beginning is so funny
Personally you have to make otter pop lore.
Wouldn’t the flavor “blue” be a cross between blueberries and raspberry? Blue raspberry!
Grape flavour comes from a special type of delicious grape
ehm matpat, water is in fact blue.  "The water is in fact not colorless; even pure water is not colorless, but has a slight blue tint to it, best seen when looking through a long column of water. The blueness in water is not caused by the scattering of light, which is responsible for the sky being blue."
I like dan
i hate blue on god
Fun fact: The recipe for Nuka Cola Quantum in Bethesda's "Fallout" themed cookbook tastes exactly like blue raspberry, but it uses pomegranate juice for much of its fruity flavor.
Blueberry 🫐                    It’s an actual berry
Blue is the best flavor
bluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue "Now we know what Areil tastes like, but SURE.

Blueberries are purple and anyone who denies it is wrong. I'm sorry but it's true

Dan is my spirit animal
I always thought Blue Raspberry was blueberry and raspberry together as a flavor 😅
Iz blue. Bluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue. *laughing uncontrollably*
When you walk into a Food Theory video already knowing the answer
ive never had blue razz anything…im a cherry guy
I think this is a language/localization issue, I’ve always known those foods as Blue Berry flavored here in Mexico
Lore for Otter Pops? Better get your energy drinks ready.
I think kids realized this before we did. They will say strawberry they will say banana but when it comes to blue raspberry it’s just blue. at least the kids I hang around.  Also I just got a blue raspberry was a blue raspberry because we already had way too many red colors already. I mean we have watermelon… strawberry… OK so those are the only two that I can eat right now but still two is One too many.
I love otter pops give me otter Pop loooooooore............please.
I'm a brewtender and can confirm that as long as that beer is in the same family, almost no one can discern the "tasting notes". And when I say something like "stonefruit notes" nobody knows what I'm talking about anyway, so I definitely see this phenomena happen EVERY single day. They just agree and nod.
I'll take my blue flavored lie and I will like it thank you very much
I've always preferred the citrus flavors (orange, lemon, and lime).  They're all artificial and don't taste like the real thing, but they're still enjoyable.
Dont do this to me mathias pathias I cant take this rn😔
A FOOD THEORY Bone at the teat
Do a food theory on how the World Wars influenced food
"Now we know what licking Ariel would taste like" AYO?
Wait the PRIME is blue!
Fun fact! Here in Australia blue raspberry is called ‘blue heaven’ because it isn’t flavoured as raspberry, therefor it is considered as false advertising by our government. We still have some blue raspberry flavoured things, but blue heaven is more common!
Fun fact, grape does taste like grape but a very specific *type* of grape, not the table grapes we eat
would not be surprised if he did do a theory on otter pops
Yes do an otter * pops theory
I am so ready for that Otter Pop lore video now.....
I was waiting for this video since the beginning of the channel
MATPAT IT'S CONCORD GRAPE!
CaptainSparklez is gonna love this
Ummm  Isn't blue razz .. a mix between blue berries... and raspberries
I got a snow cone yesterday but he just said the colors and not the flavors. Green tasted like kiwi or something eww but blue tasted good like blue berry or something. I gave the green one to my mom lol. I’ve never realized that it says blue raspberry and not blue berry and idk why I’ve never realized it until now. Do I just don’t read blue packaging?
Hey I think blue raspberry is an imposter
I said blueberry… 3:27
Blue is a flavor
I love grape stuff 🍇
Call me an egg because I was cracking up at the intro😂😂
😂Blue
I want a film theory about Fiona from Shrek.
BLUEBERRIES ARE PURPLE
Your life is a GAME THEORY
I work in the dairy department at Kroger, and there actually are regular raspberry flavored products. Yoplait has a raspberry flavored yogurt that is red, not blue. So does Chobani. About the only blue raspberry product we have is Jell-O.
Any fruit flavour taste like The fruit it supouse to taste like, not even one
TEAM OTTER POP LOOOOOORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
In Europe "blue flavour" usually means blueberry or smurf (bubblegum), I found out "blue raspberry" is a thing from american side of  youtube 👀
Only seen the intro as of writing this comment, and I must agree with Dan. Blue is a valid flavor
Dear matPat I got to thinking, and I wonder which one came first the chicken or the egg I went to your videos and seen you have a made a theory about this so what’s one came first the chicken or the egg 🥚 🐣🐓
I want Otter Pop lore.
I’m with Dan I got blue flavored slurpee
who CARES what it is, it tastes good
6:54 do it mat
4:24 I actually didn’t know the dragon flavor existed before watching this video. I’m going to have to look out for that next time I’m in the grocery store.
I DIDNT KNOW THEY HAD FLAVORS I THOUGHT THEY WERE NUST COLORS
Hey mat great video could you make a theory on why almost every food/drink product in the west has red 40. in it and what it is
I was today years old when I found out blue raspberry isn't real. I just never questioned it
I always say grape flavored stuff tastes like purple and I will stand by that statement until I die. They taste nothing like grape. But when I eat it I think: purple.
I always thought blue raspberry referenced blue berries and raspberries
I like the yellow  candys :>
Blue raspberry as a flavour reminds me of fresh blackberries but ... Bluer.
6:44. matpat, a 36 year old, saying “sending me” is cursed beyond belief
Hot take: artificial grape flavor tastes horrible
Yes now I know what blue raspberry is
Dan like "I got blue daboo dee daboo dye"
GRAPE IS GOOD.
Rainbow snow cone is superior
I would love an episode on the lore of Otterpops.
I always thought the flavor of blue raspberry was similar to a raspberry flavor but with a tinge of blueberry/grape flavor (or something that tasted like a dark heavy fruit flavor), that being that Americans make artificial flavors all taste like syrup
I don't understand why it's such a  popular flavor. I've never liked blue raspberry.
Casino B&M?
Hmmm he has a point
What does blue raspberrie have to do with machine code 4:55 oh sorry random letters
i need my otter pops theory
Matt: Now we know what licking Ariel would be like. Ariel: Don't Me: Laughs and snorts loud. My Neighbor: Shut up over there!
me and my son vote affirmative for the otter pop lore episode thanks!
Note that I often refer to a flavor as purple. As things that are supposed to taste like grapes never taste like grapes, so I say it tastes like purple.
I agree with Dan.  Blue.  I don't care if it's a manmade flavour.
I hate to break it to you but blue raspberries do exist it was a biological experiment done on berries😅 scientist combined blueberries with raspberries it got released out into the public. Actual blue raspberries r poisonous until boiled
Blue berry. l:)
what would happen if you only ate candy for a year ?
Now I want to know why 🍇 doesn't taste like grapes

I never liked anything blue raspberry it always tasted like chemicals to me, if I had to choose a flavor I have always preferred the “red” foods and flavors.
please do an otter pop lore vid im BEGGING u if yall have time
blue
I don't get it. It's blue.
I CAULD GO FOR SOME NIGGA LAVERD SNOW CONES
hold up hold up i must qoute randy felt face here 4:03 BULE BARRIES ARE F###ING PURPLE!!!!!! ok continue
Video starts at 4:30
Mat Pat should do an Otter Pops lore video.
With how easy it is to convince someone that they're tasting something, I wonder if that plays into the breakthrough mentioned awhile back about a japanese scientist figuring out how to 'code' flavors in through the 5 profiles to simulate almost any taste... How accurate is it and how much are they doing to prevent false-reads by people expecting to taste something?
Grape is condord grape.
I genuinely thought I was the only grape guy in the world
I literally am in the line at McDonalds getting a Blue Raspberry drink 😂
matpat the blue flavor is window washer fluid
Blue berry is a thing is'nt it?
:D
If matpat does make a otterpop theory would it go to food theory or film theory also how did the orange one became a orphan and why is bluu French
Please please do another popular theory that would be amazing❤❤❤
We cal it bule bary in our country???
AngryJoe would be so mad!
I wanna see the otterpop lore video
Iz Blue  Nothin to object there
I've never been a big fan of blue raspberry. After the energy drink episode, I've tried 4 flavors of Ghost, and the blue raspberry one is the only one I haven't liked.
PLEASE OTTERPOP LORE
Editor Dan is right. The flavor is blue. There is no “raspberry” it’s just blue. The flavor is blue. Blue.  OBTW, it’s also labeled as Cassis in Europe, even though it’s totally still the same flavor: blue.
Butterfly wings don't have blue pigment. They instead have micro structures that only reflect blue light.
I would love an otter pop lore video!
Thank you matpat for answering this question I had for years.
He's had this channel for over two years and now he talks about blue razberry. How?
blueberries aren't blue
banana dont taste like banana because bananas are all clones of a cultivar that survived a disease that killed the better banana cultivar clones
Skip to 5:00 to start the video.
Blue flavor best flavor
But Matt I have had a blue raspberry
Morpheus showed both colors of pill. You would be called reverse-neo, because he actually chose a color.
Grape > any other flavour
Yes on the otter pop lore
Give me an otter pop lore video please~
I like green flavor.
You didn't know about the otter pop characters?
Japan: Blue is Lemonade
It’s grape and lemon.  That’s the flavor of blue raspberry.
Blackcap Raspberry!!!!
there are two things wrong with this, and not the theory. one blueberrys arent blue. and two, grape flavored things are grape flavored, just after concord grapes. a much sweeter kind
I love that in spanish this problem does not exist, we just dont say the Flavor
As someone who’s favorite candy as a kid was blue raspberry dum dums, I never thought they tasted like raspberries. I loved raspberries, but blue raspberry didn’t taste the same. I assumed that it was a fictional fruit made for candy companies and shared by candy companies, and I was perfectly ok with that.  I also loved them because my tongue get blue, and 4 year old me loved that! Made errand day a lot better, cause we’d go to the bank first, and they always gave out Dum Dums, and the people working would always help me find the right flavor.
“Blueberries are f**** purple!”-randy Feltface
Blue raspberry breeze pros
i always thought blue raspberry was supposed to be a mix of blueberry and raspberry flavor
Ye
Blue raspberry prime taste like blue sour patch kids
Please do a otter pop lore video
Blue berry plus raspberry the raspberry just over powers.
Blue Raspberry can be whatever it wants as long as it tastes as good as it does
when I was a kid my favorite flavor was "blue". Really that meant my favorite flavor was: cotton candy, bubble gum, raspberry w/ lots of sugar, and coconut. As an adult I'm much more adventurous: dumplings/dim sum a variety of flavors are my favorite food now.
I was a weird kid, I liked grape because it tasted like medicine.
I thought blue raspberries were just what everyone calls blueberries, so either I lived in a weird small town growing up or I have been fed lies about blueberries of all things
Matpat: *Having an existential crisis* Dan: Blue
B L U E
"Blueberries are f*ckin purple"
This is the funniest intro lmao
Bluuuuuuuueeee
On godddd
Grape is the best flavor that doesn't exist.
I would love to watch the video but I love the flavor to much too let you ruin it for me <3
my only problem is that blueberries aren't blue, but purple, but I guess it's whatever
yes i know
"Blue"  "WHAT FLAVOR DID YOU GET!"  "Blue"
Havnt finished the video but I always thought it meant blueberry and raspberry
im expecting matpat making an otter pops video on film theory or food theory
Bout to blow everyone's mind here. Pink lemonade is NOT pink flavored. It's just regular lemonade flavor colored pink.
you def need to make the otter pops theory
BLUE FLAVOR
Randy Feltface: "Come on, name one natural blue food." Audience: "Blueberrys!" Randy: "BLUEBERRYS ARE FU-KING PURPLE!!"
Blue taste like  Cotten candy  But a little sour
Now i want to eat blue now
Ok that skit was hilarious.
Blue
If only there was a blue berry to be marketed as a blue berry flavor
Bro I LITERALLY manifested this in my last comment wtf
A good theory could be about how candy companies have no idea what a banana actually tastes like
As an avid hater of the blue raspberry flavor I’m very appreciative of this video.
My brother, I have blue eyes.
but blue razzberry is so badddddddd
cool blue is lingenberry. it's the same flavor profile as swedish fish
yo, matpat, i got a theory idea, why does warm milk make you sleepy (if it actually does) and if so, why?
I didn't know what the flavor was actually, but I thought it was common knowledge that blue raspberry wasn't a real berry and was completely artificial. Great video either way
Matpet, Can you make a film theory on murder drones? I'm curious on you opinion.
I'm actually surprised MatPat was unaware of the Otter Pop personas. I very much would love to learn the lore, though. Should be an interesting follow up video if it happens. 😂
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackberry jucie of this berry is bluish-purolish and its looks like raspberry
yes, beaver glands.
This intro was great!!!
I hate raspberries blue or red it doesn't matter, so this doesn't effect my life at all
But blue is my favorite flavor
I always thought blue raspberry was blueberry and raspberry lol
I had always heard that "grape" was meant to taste like concord grapes rather than  the grapes we're used to and "banana" like the Gros Michel bananas rather than Cavendish bananas which are the only kind you can buy.
This video has no reason to exist they say it’s blue raspberry it’s raspberry flavor it’s blue so they won’t mistake it for other flavors do you not know that      😩
tbh I've never noticed it being advertised as "blue raspberry" I just saw "raspberry" which happened to be blue and assumed it was bc colours go brrr. So I guess I was right?
I know this was a joke, but I genuinely want an otter pop theory.
I like blue food
OTTER POP LORE
i feel like this was done when mat actually got everyone snowcones
Yes do an otter pop theory
we stan amy
blue
The intro made me think of the soju flavour thats just "blue". I think its techniqually blueberry, but the bottle just says "blue" on it.
Something really weird is that I’ve only ever heard it called blue raspberry on the internet I’ve never heard someone in Australia call it blue raspberry I’ve only heard it called blueberry before
Editor dan shouldve sand the I'm blue song
Do NOT google where fake vanilla comes from
Theres a Japanese candy that tastes a whole lot closer to actual grape flavor imo. Meiji fruit gummies.  I prefer it to the artificial grape i wish more candies used it. Might have grape juice in it.
do otter pops lore
no blue is a real flavor. i love the flavor blue. the texture it leaves in your mouth, the slight sweet and sour of it. its just so.... *blue*
Matpat- groaning in the background Dan- Bluuuue
I have a video Idea I might be late to comment this but I’ll comment this idea on newer videos if I can remember, my video Idea is, “Is cereal a soup?” If you do see this I would love to see if you used my video idea 🙂
patiently waiting for the otterpop lore video
My life has been changed by knowing there is a popsicle flavor called Little Orphan Orange
😐😨my life is a lie!?
Love the blue song joke at 2:08 😂
Blue
4:32 "Now we know what licking Ariel would taste like"  Shits taken out of context
I don't care that blue raspberry isn't a real flavor,it still taste amazing <3
since the channel came out I have been waiting for this one!
Nobody   MatPat:They made it blue for M&Ms   My very next thought: GAAAASP they made it blue for Percy Jackson twoooooo!
Blue is the superior flavor
Style theory.
I LOVE Blue Raspberry candy! I remember when I was a kid, I asked my mother if I could try a blue raspberry. Since I loved the candy so much, I wanted to try the fruit it was based off of. When she told me they didn't exist, it was like learning that Santa Claus wasn't real all over again.
You do need to do that otter pop lore theory
I’m so happy I’ve been waiting for this theory for forever!!!
Blue raspberry is a fake flavor but everyone doesn’t care it’s just good
What about the banana flavors (specifically something like Laffy taffy), why does it taste nothing like bananas?
Blue taste like blueberry
It is blueberry
0:11 am I the only person who noticed the pan colored snow cone?
We need the ice pop lore
“Malic Acid a natural acid that comes from across many fruit including Raspberries”  “So there ya go not a raspberry in sight!!”  Sir… .-.
Food theory idea how does smell effect taste  i’m wondering because I got an ad for a bottle that supposedly changes the way water tastes by exposing you to different scents as you drink the water.
Dan grew up broke for sure, All I was was Blue, Red and Purple flavor
I just assumed it was raspberry that was blue colored like pink lemonade
I always thought it was just a blueberry + raspberry combo flavor... which I never tried because I don't like blueberries.
Frucor has a product called 'V' in our country. Their undeniably best flavor is 'Blue'. Yes it is called 'Blue' nothing else. And it's been in our market for at least a decade! (edit October 2011 blue was introduced to the market)
cmon man why do you have to ruin my taste in a candy
As someone with gustatory-visual synesthesia (meaning I can taste colors) I can confirm that the particular shade of blue used for blue raspberry flavoring tastes exactly like it's supposed to. Additionally, artificial grape flavoring tastes like the color purple, green apple tastes like green, and fruit punch tastes like the color red. Chemical engineers have figured out ways to turn unnaturally vibrant colors into something that people are able to taste and have strong associations to, and I've always found it so fascinating that there are ways to simulate what I experience on a daily basis.
Please give us an otter pop lore video!
Ok but I would absolutely watch an Otter Pop lore video
As a man of blue( bruh look at my pfp) I can now say why
0:05 ARE YOU A VAMPIRE OR A GIGA CHAD?
grape flavored things dont taste like table grapes the kind we eat but they do taste like the grapes for making wine
Grape, cherry, banana, and acid. Thanks for the tip. I’m gonna trip while eating a fruit salad 🥴🥴🤣
Hi
what FLAVOOR did u get dan? …  blu  MatPat:$@&?!&(?&$@!  man it was only a matter of time before MatPat discussed the Blue Rasberry conspiracy (iz blue)  And yeah MatPat, we want that Otter Pop LOORE episode!!! (a summer special maybe?) Great Video!
4:06 hate to break it to you Matpat but grape flavored things DO taste like grapes.  Concord Grapes.  They just don't taste like the gmo-filled orbs that you get at the grocery store. That's why grape jam/jelly tastes like artificial grape, because they use concord grapes.
Turns out while the video game industry trained us that red means explosive. We subconsciously knew blue was poison and now we want to consume it!
B L U E
Blue raspberry is just red velvet cake of the candy and drink game
Matt you said malic acid is found in lemon and rashurrt and gives a take flavor so by your own reaseach it does indeed tast of rassberries
blue
What next are you gonna tell me bubblegum isnt a fruit or cotton candy also isnt a fruit.
“NOW WE KNOW WHAT LICKING ARIEL WOULD BE LIKE”  MatPat.. noo..😭😭
blue raspberry is my favorite favorite, im sorry i should have outgrown this so long ago but its sweet and tangy and i fricking love it. ive never known what it was, so this is super interesting! doesnt stop me from loving it (:<
Lol
Bluuuuuuueeeeeeee
"Now we know what licking Ariel would taste like" dude.
Ngl kinda already knew this but good if I ever second guess myself
Careful calling blueberries blue, Matt. A certain purple muppet is gonna scream at you for that.
that may be true, but blue raspberry is still a good flavour.
1:07 got me dying 😂😂😂 2:09 as well 6:12
I hate the blue sour patch kid 😭😭
MatPat acting like he doesn’t want to do an Otter Pop lore video.
I'm pretty sure stoners are coming up with the names of the snacks. Those snacks sound like strands of grasses.
May… you know you do have to do an otter pop lore video.
W A L T U H
Great timing as I just got my blue raspberry protein powder in! a delicious lie!
…….blue bluuuuuuuuuue
Gatorade doesn’t have flavor just color
Blue
in japan the blue flavor is a soda flavor known as ramune
It is a snowball
“Yes you in the back I know blue M&M’s taste like chocolate, sit down” Me: actually I was gonna say blue M&M’s taste like sugar.
Blue 🔵
Otter*pops thery
It's blue do it wasn't confused with watermelon
Blue raspberry doesn't taste like raspberries but it sure does taste like blue.
blue
Blue not blueberry
“Water that sat next to something sweet a week ago” 🤣🤣🤣 This perfectly describes the flavor of “Hint” brand water 😂
Is this why blue raspberry tastes so bad?
So what you're saying is that blue raspberry doesn't taste like raspberry, it tastes like Blue. Sounds like blue is officially confirmed to be both a color and a flavor.
YES OTER POT LORE
did thei know i just googled this the other day after watching a german youtube be confused bt blue raspberry,so them i wondered
Blue
Most concentrated blue flavors in things like icecream, slushies, etc tastes like Huckleberry or Huckleberry mimicry. The flavor "blue" does absolutely exist. Nobody uses huckleberries because they don't have reliable growth, and only found in the northern west portion of North America.
If you guys call it anything else besides it's color then you are wrong I love purple flavor 🟣💜
otter lore pls.
Blue raspberry flavor is absolutely disgusting idk how anyone can like it 😂
Blue always tasted like sorrow to me?  How do I know what sorrow tastes like?  Well I know because of Winn-dixie.
I just ate a blue raspberry candy this is a convenient video
I’ve actually been wondering this for a while now. Thanks for answering my question
I just want to say that they lit up the empire state building blue for Percy Jackson's birthday
Blue #2 always makes my poop greeny blue
Am I the only one who thought when he pulled up the picture of vanillin powder it was going to be cocaine
And of course don't forget about the blueberry gum. What times a girl into a literal balloon?
This is fantastic
When they have strawberry, cherry and green apple, Watermellon tends to be a light pink,, while strawberry tends to be a reddish pink, Cherry tends to be super red, and well, apple is green. Thanks to Jolly Ranchers having all four flavors to be able to tell the difference between Pink Strawberry and Pink watermellon.
Okay to be honest cool blue I can’t taste it
we really missed out on a pink m&m 😭
Blue is too a flavor
in almost every candy i have tasted, Blue Raspberry has been my favorite.
“Now we know what licking Ariel tastes like” I think the Internet has beat you to it there
How
Matpat dnd
#beingbackdadpat
I would like to take this moment to thank [head editor] Dan for offering us that blue raspberry snow cone at the start       Oh wait-
F'in Dan
the grape flavor is not the flavor of a table grape because no one would want that. but instead, they used a different type of grape that no longer exist. this is the same case for bananas
4:30 calling it now: 1, blueberries aren't blue, they're purple. 2, Blue rasberry is to differentiate rasberry and strawberry for kids, as both are red and kids are stupid. Red and blue is much easier to differentiate than red and slightly-darker-red.
Head Editor Dan understands that blue is a flavor, no one change my mind
The intro deserves An oscar. Thanks, Dan! For Driving MatPat Insane.
Ok but I feel like blueberries are more purple if anything.
When I was younger I told my mom told me to pick out a fruit for lunches and I sad blue raspberry but it was not a flavor lol.
What about "Minecraft" flavor?
THANK YOU MAT PAT!!! I have been saying this for years!!
Food theory: why don’t banana Runtz taste like banana
Fun fact: banana flavored candy is based on a now much rarer and bigger variety of banana known as gros michel, which is sweeter than the cavendish you see now. It just was heavily decimated by Panama disease in the 50’s-60’s. There are attempts being made to create a version of gros michel that is resistant to Panama disease.
blue is the best flavor, it doesnt actually matter :D
Oh my. The line about licking Ariel made me just bust out laughing. Then I had to explain to my husband cause he wanted to know why I was laughing.
If this video makes me hate my favorite favor I'm going  to be upset
I crave blue raspberry now
DON'T YOU COME FOR MY FAVORITE FLAVOR, MATTHEW!!!!
Blue raspberry is just sour raspberry.
What flavor is bubblegum?
I'm more of a lemon flavor kind of gal
i love mat pat me and my brother love your channal
Bro bet this was made bc people from think blue raspberries exist
Funny enough I like grape flavored stuff, it's one of my top candy/drink choices, go grape powerade!
cool blue gatorade tastes like really sweet cranberry juice with no tart, or bitternace to me
Andrew tate definitely influenced this video
Cool blue tastes like tangerine to me
Is it weird that I don’t really watch this channel?
Otter pop lore vid please
I already knew this
Andrew rate definitely inspired this video
no one show this episode to randy feltface
We now know what licking Ariel would taste like is not a sentence that has been said before rhis
Yes, I like the purple flavor named grape too🦚
I know blue berry but what’s blue raspberry . Me ITS CAP WATCH MATPAT
Thanks for confirming why I hate blue raspberry. As I had fake banana and Cherry flavours with a passion. Good to know.
Yes.  Yes you must do a video on Otter Pop lore.
I always thought little orphan orange was an orphan because orange is the least favorite flavor
Plz do Otter pop lore
W NEED OTTER POP LORE
What about blue coral? 😂
Guys come on its so obvious.. THEY TASTE BLUE!
I love blue flavor too of everything
mmm blue
I agree with Dan
As someone who has synesthesia, blue raspberry is pretty close to the taste of the actual colour blue
lol putting in the fake Morpheus was a genius
Love how right under this video I get an ad for Sourpatch kids. It was basically there just going “cmon eat us, see if he is correct”
I would absolutely love Food Theory doing an episode on various artificial flavors.
Actually GRAPES don't taste like grapes. The giant things you buy to put in your kids' lunch-boxes have little resemblance to the way grapes actually taste, mostly because they grow them so freaking big they're mostly water (a problem with most modern produce). If you try grapes from a vineyard growing for wine-making (where the sugars need to remain high for fermentation) you can taste the actual "grape" flavor. And grape candy is closer than you might think.
Here before a million
He read my mind with the ememem flavor
Dipping into  the backlog? I wonder what we're getting next week O.o
Banana flavoring
Blue
***GRAPE FLAVORING in candy and soda tastes like CONCORD GRAPES***                               (similar to how banana flavors don't taste like our modern bananas but do taste like the original bananas we had which went extinct). I know the grape one from personal testing, but of course the banana one could be a myth, can't really verify that one.
7:33 wasberrry mat pat
This before watching I'll reply with my after watching. I always thought blue raspberry was just a flavor that was blue meant to simulate the raspberry flavor. Never seen a blue raspberry so it made sense in my eyes
Tell me that blue Gatorade doesn't taste like how the YMCA smells
Blue is my favorite flavor. Everyone knows Blue raspberry is a manufactured flavoring, but then again so is almost every processed flavor.
I knew that blue raspberry didn’t exist but finally see that be talk about on this channel made me smile
Not me saying chocolate and then him just going and telling me off
My dreams at 3am
Blue raspberry tastes like blue.
Blueberries aren't blue.
Food theory idea: Margarine.vs Butter
Blueberries are fricking Purple
Grape flavor is meant to mimic Concord grapes.
So Blue Raspberry is the “swampwater” of flavours? Nice👌🏼
Respect the BLUE flavor
Bro should've tinted the whole intro blue lol. Should have had the snow cone cover the screen then start the intro as all blue.
So amaranth named herself after a food dye?
i love blue
Blue
4:32 I'm pretty sure a good couple thousand people out there dream about her flavor lol
MATPAT AND STEPH STOP STALKING ME!! I SEARCHED UP IF BLUE RASPBERRIES ARE REAL YESTERDAY AND SAID *hmm i wish there was a video about this* LOL
Even though I already knew before this explained it deeper. Cool video! Also you should do a video on the Bubblegum's Odd flavor.
I would of replied chemical cocktail to any candy when asked what the flavour is(outside of specific hard Candy's
I say this before I watch the conclusion to this episode, blue raspberry is just blueberry and raspberry mixed together. The name makes sense and it tastes like it too🤫
Craziest part is I thought of this like a week ago. I was drinking a sods that was blue raspberry flavored and my mom asked what it tastes like and I was dumbfounded.
What happened to nugget. EDIT: blueberries are purple not blue. edit again: I want someone to breed a raspberry to be blue
Why is blue razz so good
BLUE
Matpat, there is indeed a berry that is a blue raspberry. It grows very local on a island called Gotland in  Sweden and more sparse in other regions. We namned it Salmbär in our historic accent but in Swedish its called Blå hallon (translated to Blue raspberry/Dewberry (Rubus caesius)). This is indeed so local and rare that many swedes dont even know what it is but it is indeed a raspberry in the color blue/blackish. Also here in Sweden the taste of blue raspberry isnt common, dont even know if its possible to get if not imported so i cant say if its any where close in taste!  PS I´ve not studied plants more than googling now to find out more, just know about our native plants.
This is Percy Jackson!!!
I too enjoy blue flavor.
Idk if this is a canadian thing or not but I have 0 Idea what an otter pop is and the only times I have had a Icee is at the amusement park
Grape tastes like really bad cough medicine from childhood. Yuck!!
MathewPathew: blue things in nature are dangerous Me, eating blueberries: oh no
This is the second video this weak with assumptions born out of ignorance - grape flavored stuff is actually modeled after a very specific grape called a Concord grape - don’t often find them at the grocery store, but they taste pretty much like the jelly and grape flavored candy
Haven’t finished watching this yet, but my cousin who runs a confectionery explained it to me this way. Raspberry was one of the first flavors to be made synthetically, and the chemicals used at the time when mixed happened to be blue, and since it was still new and there wasn’t a set naming pattern, they used the color and flavor to name it, hence blue raspberry. Today most synthetic flavors are mixed clear and have the dyes added after
i thought blue raspberry was blueberries and raspberries
Blue
Fun fact; I cannot stand the flavor of artificial/liquified grape. No grape juice, no grape candy, no wine. I can eat actual grapes tho, love me some green grapes
Tavish
I'm blue if i were green I would live.
Melvin ravishing finnegan degroot
Blue
I always thought blue raspberry came around because there were too many red flavors already, like watermelon cherry and strawberry so candy and drink makers just needed a way to distinguish raspberry from those. But that's just  a theory . . .
blue 👍
Blue M&Ms taste like chocolate
BLUEBERRIES ARE FUCKING PURPLE
Cool blue taste like orange juice
"Blue raspberry' basically tastes like someone rolled a variety of berries around a chemical factory.
Blue                                                                        _                    | Help me and  comment "blue" down below! | .                                                                            V
Pretty sure it's just blue flavor
I always figured "blue raspberry" was raspberry flavoured but dyed blue to distinguish from strawberry flavoured things
cool blue IS NOT a top seller at my sore i know this since i work at a jewel it would be fruit punch or orange
Grape flavour tastes like grapes.... Buy some Concord grapes
col
Thanks for reminding me that it's been well over 10 years since I've had a snow cone.  Most places here just don't serve it.  And the last place I remember having it was a shack run by boy scouts outside a grocery store.  That closed down because the store wanted to basically take all the profits.
And here I thought Blue Raspberry was from Golden Raspberries … huh
Haven’t watched it yet but isn’t it just blueberry raspberry fake flavors blended
3:25 to answer your question matpat, the answer is sugar.... they taste like sugar
A delicious lie indeed!
Make A otter pop food theory video please
It's blue flavored.
As someone who loves the blue raspberry flavor a lot and it's my go to flavor for sweets... i feel attacked 😅😅
I've always seen blue raspberry and normal raspberry as two different flavors. They taste different. I've also always known blue raspberry was artificial and still liked it
OTTER POP LORE THEORY!!
I just like how mat pat just plainly said that “now we know what the little mermaid taste like “. Go and get your head out the gutter!
Shane Dawson just made a video about this
Was this really a suprise?
Can confirm blue is a flavor
I feel Randy Feltface's rage steadily rising
Matpat ! Licking aerial! U didn’t think that through did u ?
Now I'll be waiting for the otter pops lore video.
I have been waiting for this theory since this channel arrived.
This episode is just MatPat having a breakdown
Grape flavor does taste like Grapes, Concord Grapes... Most people just never eat Concord Grapes.
Honestly, I also call that flavor "blue."
Yes do otter pop lore!
Please do an otter pop lore dump , because little orphan orange is a favorite. I need to know why?
the entire gatorade company in a nutshell
Percy Jackson would love this episode
T
9:32 Father of Tavish Finnegan DeGroot, also known as the demo man from tf2?
Why do I feel like Dan's line of just sayin "Blue" wasn't actually in the script but him just wingin it?
great video! except mat said he likes grape 😭😭😭
I genuinely thought blue raspberries were real until I saw this 😅
My favorite flavoring tends to be grape, but when it comes to laffy taffy, banana is my go to. I love banana laffy taffy. WAY more than any other flavors.
did dan make matpat  cry
Blueberries are purple man idk
It's not blue it's blu
Fun fact: I going to see the blue man group in Chicago soon.
otter, pop, lore, otter, poplar, otter, pop, floor
In Canada, at least, I've seen some juice box brands still using amaranth 😬
I feel like the opening skit was inspired by true events
There needs to be an episode on why banana flavored stuff doesn't taste like bananas (Spoiler, it does, just not the bananas we have today.)
wait so what flavor did matt get at thebeginning
This is so weird! MatPat, you literally keep uploading videos on things I've researched. It's crazy! Like the medieval food one ... I had JUST been having a conversation with my friend about the exact topic with exact examples!!
This is hilarious because I'm eating  blue sour patch kids lol😂
I already refuse to call soft drinks and soda by their names, I just call em by their colour. Ayo can I get some of that red?
Blue is a flavor
Head editor Dan got skylight from pelicans 🥰. (For those who don't know skylight is literally just a plain blue color. No real flavor to it. Just blue ice)
I never really associated flavor blue raspberry with raspberries, I always thought it was just a name they made up for a flavor that was colored blue
Yes. Yes you do. You do have to do the otterpop theory now. I'm waiting for the notification from now on telling e you've done it xD
As a wise Australian Muppet comedian once said ---  "BLUE BERRIES ARE F****** PURPLE" 😂
This is so interesting! But we don't eat too many blue foods in our household. Even if the FDA deems blue as the safest of all colors, my daughter gets violently ill when ingesting it. I discovered this the hard way after she ate some brightly blue colored cookies and then ice cream. No blue for her! 😂
Not to mention… Peach flavored things are either YELLOW, Orange, or Red (and sometimes pink) BUT NOT ACTUALLY PEACHE (sometimes)
I mean, to be fair, if you have any flavor of snow cone or Gatorade or whatever it never tastes like it's food based on, so.
Matpat: Blue raspberry has never been a thing. Dr. Mephesto (south park mad scientist): "hmmm I think i know what my next project will be" Homer: Mmmmmm... amaranth
Woah, Mat was getting pretty upset over Dan's snow cone. Guess you could say he was feeling pretty blue.
No that has been my favorite flavor of all time 😭
OT-TER POP THE-OR-Y OT-TER POP THE-OR-Y OT-TER POP THE-OR-Y OT-TER POP THE-OR-Y🦦🍭
Anybody else thinks Food Theory's getting a little dirtier and/or disturbing??😅
Does the otter pops episode go to the film theory channel or the food theory channel?
What about blue orange flavor?
Blue Gatorade/Powerade is best Gatorade/Powerade
Surprised Matpat didn’t mention the lil irl Pokémon known as the man-o-war when talking about blue usually being used as a warning
I did not know blue rasberry was so liked. Am I the only one that does not like it?
Five hours early
I just thought that it was blueberries and raspberries ;-;
Yes you have to do an otter pop looooooooooore theory
has anyone else realised that matpat probably hides lore in the intro that is moving so fast
I like orange
Okay this is ruined my childhood, Blue raspberry is my favorite flavor
Please do otter pop lure!!!!
w vid
Yes xD I would watch an otter pop lore video hahaha
I always thought as a kid that blackberries were blue raspberry or the actual flavor.
11:37 blue raspberry flavor
blue is blue  gg ez
ITS EFFING BLUE FLAVOR
Blue raspberry was one of my favorite candy “flavors” as a kid, but my mom was like Matpat and it annoyed her. 😂
If you are quick you can snap an other pop in half and have two smaller opened otter pops ready to eat
Mmm blu no:2
4:33 😂😂😂
Otter pop lore video please 🤝😂
This did NOT need to be 13 minutes long.
“Now we know what licking Ariel would taste like.”  Um what? 🤨
mat PLZ MAKE A OTTER POP LORE PLZ
"blue"  Matpat's one trigger other than FNAF.
blue gatorade taste like cotton candy
i've been needing to know this i have always asked, why on  earth is raspberry the red fruit BLUE?
𝗕𝗟𝗨𝗘𝗘𝗘𝗘𝗘
What if blue raspberry is just people that cant remember blue berry
Blue raspberry is just raspberry but blue
I am someone who agrees with the flavor blue
Blue Raspberries are actually real, they're just over harvested to be used in snacks making them endangered. There just aren't very many Blue Raspberry plants anymore.
ya do have to do an otto pop theory now lol I'm invested!
Blue.
Would this mean that watermelon isn’t flavored watermelon? Oh no
Raspberry should have been kicked to the curb for Blueberry, smh.
I just call it windex flavor
people really not like grape flavor?
I was just thinking about this yesterday; thank you!!!
Otter Pop Lore Theory confirmed.  Make it happen!
Bluuuuuueeeeeeee
Reminds me of pear flavored candies from the early 2000s
“Blue”
I never understood how people could think that each color of fruit loops or skittles taste different, each color tastes exactly the same to me. My ego tells me it’s because my brain is just too “advanced” to be fooled by color but I think my taste buds or the part of my brain that decides taste might be a little bit screwy.
I think everyone is missing an important part of the video: this man just dunked on grapes saying they're as flavorful as la Croix. Where are the pitch forks???
Not him calling me out as SOON as I said m&m's are chocolate, brotha 🤣🤣🤣😭
Blue is actually my favorite color… literally any shade, i dont care. Navy blue? Sure. Cyan? Yep
it taste like blue
Grape flavor comes from Concord grapes, you dunce!
This video reminds me of the Randy Feltface “Brayden Can’t Eat Blue” bit.
blooooooooo
Holy crap! Finally someone else tastes margarita in the otter pops. I thought I was crazier than I actually am.
Another "popular" thing I didn't even know existed before this video.
We all know that orange is the best color flavor right?
You're a lie
4:33 <Rule 34 has entered the chat>
But we can all agree blue raspberry is the best flavour
Well now that you actually said it. Please do otterpop lore theory.
BLUE
Sharkelberryfin
blueberries are purple-
Yes, please do an otter pop lore
I definitely need an otter pop lore episode
My flavor would be purple
Pan flag snow cone??
Blue raspberry best flavor ever you can’t change my mind
I just say it's blueberry XD
Grape does taste like some grape varieties just not table grapes most people are use to.
Grape doesn't taste like grape, but it sure tastes like purple
You literally just said that he can come from raspberries the last ingredient but then two seconds later you say without a rasbary and site well I do get that they probably use like something more acidic or more that they can use raspberries 12:08
Ofcourse Melvin De Groote is good, He's Dutch!
... yeah.
1:43 THAT THING IS HORRIFING
What was the theory?
My whole life has been a lie
I would argue that the grape flavor that we know is 'trying' to be like concord grapes. But what do i know.  I'm just some dude with a theory. A Dude theory!
The very first blue raspberry flavored thing that I remember was actually blow pops. Great video as usual, MatPat.
Grape DOES taste like grape, just not the kind of grapes that are most commonly found in American stores. There's a type of grape with a thick peel and a slippery, almost rubbery inside that slips out of the peel once the peel is broken. It tastes exactly like artificial grape flavoring.
Is Matt part gaslighting?
You clearly didn't watch Greg Cohen's video on the Lofty Pursuits channel, shame on you.
I need otter pop lore right now plz.
I miss when matpat was still in the closet
0:38 Percy Jackson would disagree as blue is in fact a flavor
Do otter pops lore video!
Yes, Matt you need to do an otter pops theory lore now.
Watching this at the gym rn
“Blue Hawaii” is also a blue flavor, coconut and orange
Blue spam here
Blue raspberry is the best! You can pry it from my cold dead blue hands
Of course they aren’t really raspberry flavored, otherwise your mouth would burn after eating.
Grape candy all tastes like medicine.
ok before i finish this episode i'm just gonna say, i thought blue raspberry was a mix of blueberry and raspberry. i always just thought it was two flavors combined.
*B l u e*
OTTERPOP VIDEO  OTTERPOP VIDEO OTTERPOP VIDEO
I love head editor Dan’s response.
blue berries
Blueberries aren’t actually blue the purple
"Now we know what licking Ariel would taste like" 💀
otter pop lore now or suffer the consequences
"Do I have to do an otter pop lore theory?" Yes mattpat you absolutely have to do an utter pop lore theory video and you have to start working on it right now 😂
BLUEBERRIES ARE NOT BLUE!!!! THEY ARE PURPLE!!!
randy: blueberry is f0cking purple!
Concord grapes mic drop
I think this whole video is a breaking bad reference
The intro gives me de ja vu
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Imma need that otter pop lore video
OTTERPOP LORE
There's also something in the difference between the artificial strawberry flavor and the actual fruit... Berry, whatever
head editor dan is me         ALL HAIL THE BLUE
I'm glad someone talked about blackberries, if only briefly. Now I need huckleberries to enter the conversation.
aw man :(
Great video. I would love to see a theory video on Bean Boozled, so if you have any theories on Bean Boozled, make sure to make a video on your theory.
Everybody knows Blue Raspberry doesn’t exist but everyone knows Blue Raspberry is the best
do otterpops lore theory mattypatty
nikola tesla was the greatest inventor edison was a dirty business man and a thief
Why do we have a color named after a poison exactly?
Head Editor Dan gets me blue is my favorite flavor
Matpat’s description of Otterpops was absolutely on point from my childhood summer experiences.👌  But you just can’t not have them.
In response to your Grape comments MatPat, I can say there is a strain of grapes that does taste like "purple" or candy grape. I think it's Concord? I used to have them all the time while stationed in Korea because the farmer's market sold them.  Just have to be careful with seeds because those are bitter as heck.
Since you went there, but didn't actually cover it. There is no such thing as pink lemons. So despite the fact I think I heard where it came from. Where did pink lemonade come from @Matpat?
Actually blueberries are purple not blue
It is
Blue raspberry doesn’t exist, everyone knows it’s just called “blue flavor” just blue.
So like breaking bad? Anyone?
Blue
for the foreshadowed day of explaining "grape" flavor, the NileRed vid of turning gloves into "grape" flavor might be a good source or at least a good talking point
PAN SNoWCONE PAN SNOWCONE
“bluuuuuuuuuuuu”-head editor dan(😂😂😂😂😂)
OTTER POP LORE!!
Grapr taste like grapes just not table grapes which are normal grapes like what you buy in supermarkets
Blue chain
BLUE
They are simply blue flavor
11:40 is when he says what are the components of the blue raspberry taste
blue
I'm curious, do scientists say blue is the rarest color in nature based on what they see or... is there a deeper scientific knowledge about it? Since well, we don't see the full spectrum
I need Otter Pop lore pronto!
I've never called it blue raspberry flavored. I've always called it blueberry flavored.
Blue
"Here's an easy way to keep it in mind. Imagine a stop sign. When you see a stop sign, you stop, right? Stop signs are red. So imagine a blue stop sign instead. Simple, right?"
U said that blueberries were blue when they are actually PURPLE
The blue coconut flavor exits
b l u e
But it tastes so.. good.
They should have made all of the blueraspberry stuff blueberrys.
Mat let Head Editor Dan enjoy his Blue outside of the enclosed writing room.
OMG PLZ DO OTTER POP LORE!!!!!!
It tastes like green to me
I have blue story! I was at a work party/function where a really good friend of mine was responsible for bringing the drinks. She brought blue lemonade, blue drink with lemons floating in it. It tasted blue. There was no better word for it. What you may think the color blue tastes like, that was it. Just blue. We invested the jug the blue drink came in, and yes, it was just called Blue Drink, and it had no discernable flavors. Just blue dye, corn syrup, and water. It was bizarre.   Also, now that I know there is lore about Otter Pops, I need a full episode about them.
I was going to say most blue things are tropical punch flavor because many drinks that I drink that are blue are tropical punch and they taste a lot like blue raspberry candies. And I guess it's all the same.
I absolutely cannot eat or drink blue things, they’re just too gross😭
I always thought blue raspberry was just normal raspberry except blue
Blueberries are purple! 😠
Its wierd this vídeo exist at all, did you guys actually belived blue raspberries exists?
I've always HATED grape flavored anything. I love grapes. I HATE grape flared stuff. So I think I can agree with you that grape doesn't taste like grape, or else I'd actually like it.
Blue is the best flavor ever.
any otter pop style popsicle you can just break in half and its perfectly open and ready
I love blue poison dart frogs
why is there 2 otter pop characters for cosmic coconut? also, not gonna lie everytime he says amaranth, i know its spelled differently and i know he's talking about a flower but it jsut brings the streamer to mind so its like he's sayin the streamer amouranth is linked to cancer lmao
Cool blue is garbage
Find out what Ariel tastes like? Man this episode sure took a wild turn!
So, that’s why people eat blue meth!
The man has never had a concord grape?
Interesting factoid: pistachios were dyed red for a long time! They used red no.2!
I see this as I;m drinking a blue raspberry Misty Freeze from DQ.
Blue is a tasty flavor but I prefer red
Blue raspberries are a real flavor. At least here in Germany they exist 😂 they’re called „Brombeere“
Dan saying blue flavor Remind s me of sody  pop  in chili nugget.✌✨
I ment please do it
I am shaking crying and pooping myself rn
The red sour patch kid is the best
Blue
I want that otter pop theory 😂
Now I’m curious about cherry-flavored things. Also, MatPat, are maraschino cherries artificial or natural??
Plenty do it
OTTER POP LORE THEORY!!!!
I'd really like to see a full video on how people used to think that red #2 dye caused cancer, if that proved true or not, and if it isn't true, why I still have people tell me that all the time
FINALLY someone made a video about blue raspberry. I've always wondered what it actually is.
Wait, is coconut a flavor?
Ehhh, there are genetically modified blue raspberries but not really
Style theory such an L should have been book theory or anything besides style theory.
Why do companies just make the ketone that gives the aroma and tast just like a raspberry. I have made raspberry ketone in the lab before in my chemistry major and it was not difficult and the cost was low.
AYYYY! Go back to this Otter Pop thing...
Now what is the bubble gum flavor?
Not a huge fan of otter pops, but I definitely want that lore
I just thought it was a mix of blueberries and raspberries 🤷🏽‍♀️
3:19 This came just after I said, out loud, “The M&M’s taste like chocolate.” 😂😂😂
Blue raspberry gang FOR LIFE
and here I thought it was blueberry and raspberry mix
Markiplier is grieving.
Otter Pop Lore! Otter Pop Lore! Otter Pop Lore! Otter Pop Lore!
They just made it blue as red was taken for strawberry, raspberries are sourer than strawberries, yellow is taken, lime is taken so blue it was. Made sense to my 7 year old self mainlining blue slush puppies! 🤣
people love blue rasberry so much, i was at a overnight cmap and there was snowcones of diffrent flavord and blue rasberry dominated lol
Mybe someday, if you didnt already, do an episode on why artificial banana flavors do not taste like actual bananas (they taste like the old banana family that was almost wiped out by a disease) would love to see your point on that ❤
Sour blue starburst were the sht before they got discontinued.
I legit thought they were just blueberry flavors.
BLUE RASBERRY IS NOT FAKE IT IS REAL
Blue Raspberry is the best berry
I love blue raspberry! It's my favorite 😍  I like grapes 🍇 but, I don't like grapes flavored things because I find they taste like cough syrup
Did the cookie or cookie dough come first 🤔
Commenting before watching the video, trying to predict the final conclusion from 5 minutes of googling: Blue raspberries exist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus_leucodermis Too many things are red, processed sweet food companies needed to visually differentiate cherry from strawberry from raspberry from watermelon. Since blue raspberries exist, it made sense to give them the color blue even though the "blue raspberry" flavor wasn't isolated from them or made to mimic them particularly closely.
These videos never fail to entertain. 🙌
Yes please do an otter pop theory
Blue taki chips
6:07 Bro mat pat just explained a childhood
H.E.D. is my spirit animal
Wha- how- who  I WAS TAUGHT THAT IS WAS A MIX OF BLUEBERRY AND RASPBERRY
I like how u stated why not use an actual blue berry like blueberry. But blueberries are not blue either they are purple.
I always thought the blue flavor was blueberry
I want otter pop lore
I guess it’s just cultural thing. We don’t have blue raspberry in Thailand but when people see blue drink the most default idea for us is Blue Hawaii, which tastes like wonky lime juice.
blue apple sauce used to give me a headache on par with a hang over
As a wise puppet once said, "BLUEBERRIES ARE F*CKING PURPLE"
If they found the flavor of mermaid, who first licked Ariel?!
6:32 yess you have to make an otter pop vid
Deadly octopus. Yeah that's from Australia, where I live *sigh*
Which color if grape FI you prefer? Purple, red, or green?
Blue taste like chicken to me
Thank you for stating the obvious Captain obvious
people thought red M&M's caused cancer while they were smoking 6 cigars.
Ah yes, grape
at least now i know why i dislike blue raspberry. its that last bit. that acid-y bit. not a fan.
as georgie cooper once said: "the blue food situation in this country needs some work"
I can’t speak for everyone, but I would personally love an “otter-pop lore“ video!
that grape flavor theory should go along with a banana flavor theory--  They're both interesting (and similar) stories about how much artificial flavors have changed with time-- or rather, how much they haven't actually changed at all. Grape flavoring is inspired by Concord grapes, while Banana flavoring is actually inspired by a now dead/extinct strain of banana called the 'Gros Michel' that was far sweeter, as opposed to modern 'Cavendish' bananas' more reserved taste.  The entire sort of story of artificial flavoring (especially the flavors that are now main staples due to what fruits were popular at the time) is so fascinating to me
ANOTHER THEORY ALERT ANOTHER THEORY ALERT
*slurps my blue raspberry slush as I watch this*
click like on my comment to vote for an outer pop theory
Am I going crazy or was matpat not addicted to diet Dr. Pepper? I must be crazy
I love me my blue raspberry
Anyone that says Blue isn't a flavor obvious hasn't looked at the various flavors of Gatorade.
All Hail Blu!
I always just assumed it was a mix of blueberry & raspberry lollll
Some blue raspberry frozen drinks are just apple juice
Head Editor Dane got the Gamersupps flavor.
you're a fake flavor.
Why are people watch this pointless nonsense of a channel?
Oky but most grape products also just taste like purple, not actually grape
There are grapes that taste like grape candy though... selective breeding and genetic modification for the win.
Am I the only one bothered by the fact that the meme at the end of the episode wasn't correct based on the colors that were representing the flavors?
Otterpop lore the lore we didn’t know we needed 🎉🎉
Matpat acting pretty sus... Why you liking Ariel in your thoughts. Stop it. 😂
And then nearly 30 years later you learn from a TikTok that the proper way to open the otter pops is to just snap them in half and you have to reevaluate your struggles as a child.
Already from the incredible video intro I would tell this was going to be another good Theory video.
Why not just make it Blueberry 🫐 flavoured at that point lol 😂
yes an otter pop lore theory is needed.
Pausing before I even finish, I want to see how this lines out before i'm biased. Answering the question what I think blue rassberry or just most blue stuff just taste like, its a less sweet sharper tasting berry, usually like there's more citric acid. I hazard to guess its either a hybrid of lemon and raspberry, or just the appearance messing with tastebuds and changing the perceived flavor.
I’m also a grape guy my self too mat I’ve always love grape
Your description of the ‘otter pops’ tells me you need to come down to Australia, we’ll show you how to eat a zooper dooper
I can't wait until he does banana!
THE LORE OF ODDER ;POPS
I always thought the idea of a blue raspberry was a strange one, even as a kid! Then again, we did have a raspberry plant growing in our backyard.
*bluueee*
sorry dye
Am eating blue raspberry sour patch kids snack pack right now
Blue.
I LOVE THIS CHANNLE
Okay, so MatPat agrees that La Croy tastes like 90% percent of water mixed with 10% lack luster juice or whatever?  YESSSSSSS! That stuff is disgusting. Might as well become an alcohol brand.
blueberry
I need an otter pop lore video
It's not everyday that food theory does an episode that confirms something I've thought all along. Blue raspberry has always been a sour option to me so I've thought it was a fruity lemonade flavor.
It is interesting how our mind does effect things. I like watermelon but I don’t like watermelon flavored candy. When I think of eating watermelon the first thing I think of is the crunchy and juicy texture over the actual flavor.
0:50 Did somebody see that dancing banana in the background?
Its blue.
blue
blue is the best flavor tho
Honestly an otter pop theory doesn’t sound bad
Finally someone covered this my god
When it came to snow cones I would act like dan often
What does the number after a color mean?
Rasp berries are NOT blue!  And to color a raspberry drink that color is a crime against nature!!
Me who just had snowcones and came across this same dilemma when choosing my flavour
4:04 BLUEBERRYS ARE FUCKING PURPLE
blue tastes like food die
little orphan orange
At 4:10 whatever you are describing -- that's not true grape flavor. Eat a bunch of Concord grapes (yeah with seeds, toughen up and spit them out) and you will *know* what grape flavor is.
So Otter Pop lore is definitely happening, yeah?
Did no one saw the colors mattpad chose for hes Snow cone
funny how Shane posted about this a week or 2 ago lmao
OTTER POP LORE 👇
Dan thanks for the blue, that stuff was amazing
I’m a bartender and we use blue curaçao in a ton of our drinks and it’s literally orange flavor but blue is the color that sells so whenever someone orders a drink with the blue stuff in it, it’s very flashy and then we get like 10 more drink orders of it immediately after!
Nice vid
As a puppet onc said "blue berries are fucking purple!"
The intro though
Blue raspberry is always my default choice when I don't want to know other flavor to choose
Yassss to otter pop lore video
ICEE is NOT a Slurpee™
The flavor of blue is BLUEberry
E
I love seeing the rest of the staff and those raspberries are SOOO detailed!! Amazing!!!
A Otterpop lore theory would be great
Blue
I’ve actually had this question ever since I was a kid! Thank you for making this episode 😊
Blue is my favorite candy flavor. I don't care that no real fruit looks like that, and it doesn't taste like any real fruit. It's my favorite color, it's unabashedly artificial, I love it.
1:08 in my head I've always made jokes like meat my friend hue the manity
I went down this exact rabbit hole during lockdown
*BLUE* is a good flavor *BLUE* should be the king of colors a *BLUE* frog sounds nice *THE BLUE CULT*
What about blackberries?
What about blue jay
Bllluuuuuuueeeeee
Oh Matpat, skipping up in my subs to tell me I’ve been being lied to
Bro just dissed the best flavor of candy.
I would absolutely love Food Theory doing an episode on various artificial flavors.
I always just shoved a blueberry into the little cavity of a raspberry and called it a day
How is that otters pop lore coming along?
Wouldn’t it just be better to call it blue fruit punch at this point or just fruit punch?
Blue flavored whatever is always gross
I hate to break it to you guys but blue raspberry is blueberry and raspberry
I missed seeing the intro
Style theory:. Blue is the worlds favorite color Are you sure?  In Russia, ghe favorite color is red.  Pretty sure that holds true in China as well.
As you were talking about the flavors I started to smell and taste them weird, right. Well, now I want otter pops and other treats from my past. 😄
Licking Ariel tastes salty and like the ocean 🤣
If you're going to tackle grape, consider getting some grape candies from Japan as well. Their concorde grape flavoured candies (various types and brands) are some of my favourite grape confections.
I just LOVE Blue raspberry
blue Gatorade just tastes like blue lemonade
I want to lick a mermaid
Blue is the warmest color.
I like red n blue there the best flavours
I would definitely watch an otter pops lore
Snak pack made such a disgusting yogurt to the point as a kid I threw it up and didn't notice it.   Also I love this theory!
Bluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue
I love blue raspberry sweets 😋
9:12 Oh is it? Funny how that's the color that a friend of mine is allergic to. Yeah, allergic to blue colored candy. Sucks to be him.
this reminded me when i discovered what cranberries and blue berries are called in Chile. Blue Berries = Arándanos. Cranberries = Arándanos Rojos.
The beginning with some of the team members was so good! I am so happy we are getting to hear some of your team members, not saying that just MatPat is boring, but it's fun!
Uh weird, at least in spanish it has been "Mora azul" (blueberry) which always made some sense even if the flavor is obviously synthetic
Blue
Blue raspberry is the best
I was once handed a drink at a fair that came in one of those generic lemonade cups. I swear for a split second when I drank it all I tasted was lemonade and then suddenly it changed to Pepsi. Apparently it was Pepsi the entire time but my brain saw the lemonade on the side of the cup and assumed that's what I was drinking and then I guess the fizz probably threw me off enough that I had to recalibrate.
Amouranth is still giving people cancer LOL
Blue.
Long ago in middle school, I decided Blue Raspberry was my favorite fruity flavor
Blue
After growing and trying Concord grapes you can see where artificial grape is mimicking the flavor. When I tried them for the first time it tasted exactly like grape flavored capri suns, although being less sweet, but the flavor was all there.
Please do a food theory on artificial food dying linked with early children target food and their negative effects on development and how the same cereal company’s already offer food dye free foods outside the USA
Blue Raspberry is just not a good flavor... The blue is the WORST Sour Patch Kid.
Iz blu
Blue raspberry is mixed with multiple flavors like banana  Edit: blueberries are purple
Blue
BLUE
Nice video
I would love an otter pop theory
That cold open 🤣      I think it's Raspberry flavoring with BLUE food coloring       After Video Edit: I'm actually surprised with this answer, I honestly thought My thoughts were right
Fun fact. That butterfly 🦋 shown at 1:30 is NOT actually blue. It’s wings reflect light in a specific way that you see as a blue color just like the sky. There’s no blue pigment involved!
Yes, to Otter pop lore theory. I'm down
Id love a lore video for the otter pods honestly
Wow, as someone who knew that already I laughed at this
Now I want a vid on how magic shell chocolate works
grape is gross
12:32 same my bro
Blue berries are purple, not blue.
Is it not just blueberry raspberry but shortened to blue raspberry
What is the flavor of blue....Artificial, it's Artificial
You should do a theory on what "birthday cake" flavor is
That mermaid pudding mentioned better taste like sushi
A younger me got so upset when I found out blue raspberries didn't actually exist. Now... I still am greatly disappointed that blue raspberries don't exist.
8:23-AMARANTH!!! Nightwish fans' brains:*don't say it, don't say it...ok f*ck it, I'm gonna say it* CARESS THE ONEEEE!!!!🎶
This video gave me diabetes.
As someone from a non-english speaking country, I had never even heard of the blue raspberry flavor before lol.  Here it's just blueberry... which of course doesn't taste like blueberry at all.
Man can't believe Amouranth killed so many people she seems so nice.
The real question is, what flavor did MatPat get? He has red, yellow, and BLUE.
You in the back yes Blue m&ms do taste like chocolate sit down got me. I was thinking that as soon as he asked what they taste like
I'm gonna say it- BLUEBERRIES ARE F*CKING PURPLE
The flavor may be different but if you close your eyes
In my home state, one of the universities has a creamery run by the students. The flavor I always get is ‘That blue one’ and the only way to describe the flavor is blue. Like not even blue raspberry, just blue.
Where otter-pop lore?
So, grape flavor in drinks and candy is an actual grape flavor. It’s called a Concord Grape. Obviously it’s a more natural chill version in the grapes. They are kinda hard to find, but they pop up a couple times a year. Try ‘em if ya find em. It’s a trip.
bright colors is usually a sign of toxicity. no wonder majority of the rainbow haired individuals are ...... jk hehe
Wait... am I the only one who opens otter pops by breaking them?
I'm glad the editor didn't say anything more than 'BLUE' when saying the flavor he got.
When I am watching a food, game, film, and fashion theory, I get a coke orange and some chips and just press play and just watch.
Why was DJ Tropicool also labeled as Cosmic Coconut?
Blue.
My life is a lie.
*The B l u e*
Makes me wonder: why can't I think of any blackberry flavored candy?  After strawberries, I think blackberries are the best tasting fruit.  Oh well, my opinion is of course not universal.
I need the otter pop lore give it to me
Not me watching this video eating blue raspberry flavored cotton candy now I can only taste blue
blue
I can never understand why people pick on grape flavor. To me, if I had to pick one flavor to most consistently taste like the flavor it claims to be, then it is grape.  The one I pick on is watermelon. Actual watermelons are so generic in flavor that I don't know how someone even begins to decide what flavor they are trying to imitate in order to make it.
Hey matpat, im not sure if it would make an entire episode but since your brought up "fantasy" in this one, i figure id put this out there.  if you empty a monster Nitro energy drink into a small round glass bottle, it could easily pass as a fantasy stamina potion (and work as one, its an energy drink after all)  so it makes me wonder, what other foods do we have in our modern time that put in a different wrapping, could they fit in a fantasy settings?  do we essentially have real fantasy foods in our modern era?
I have always loved blue raspberry I have always known it was not a real flavor well i know what it is know
0:47 "I'm going to guess that means we can take a lick..." **Chomp**
This is why blue is my favorite color
OTTERPOP LORE YEEEEEES
If you make outo pop lore it'll make me so happy
4:34
We need an otter pop lore episode lol😆
Can confirm, blue is best flavor for icees. I've always enjoyed the general fruit flavor with a touch of sour. Something about it seems less abrasive than other artificial flavors... Banana is my second favorite.
Blue
I think the person who tasted whatever the original blue rasberry flavor probably just described it as "Raspberry, but... bluer"
Didn't NileRed make grape flavor from a latex glove?
I paused the video right as he said that "There are perfectly good berries out there that ARE actually blue," and then showed a blueberry. BLUEBERRIES ARE PURPLE! They look blue on the outside but are actually a nice purple.
Ruining one of my favorite candies and one of its flavors since 2023
In my opinion, I believe that blue raspberry is a mix of blueberries and raspberries.😋💙🫐 🎵 I'm blue yeah I'm feeling alright baby I'ma have the best freaking night of my life and where ever you take me I'm down for the ride baby you know I'm good yeah I'm feeling alright 🎵 You guys know that song?😁
You should absolutely do an otter pops lore video
If it hasn't been brought up, the blue of the blue mopho butterfly from near the start of the video isn't actually blue. Just like the sky or ocean, it is the product of light refraction.
Dan had blue vanilla
Mat going insane over Dan saying "Blue" is just plain funny
Grape DOES taste like grapes. It tastes like Concord grapes!!
if blue raspberry were real they'd be the best fruit ever tbh
why is it no and not nu becase it means nubenr i cant spell
TIL Blue Raspberries don't exist.
Even neutrons are pictured as blue and they're literally radiation
Matt did you really use the same red flag joke on two channels in the span of two weeks…. Respect.
blue
1:34 The blue lobster jumpscare sound just played in my head for some god forsaken reason
If he know about the otter pops, does he know about the string cheese?
Blue flavor!!!
im sorry, blueberries are blue?  ima quote randy feltface real quick and say "BLUEBERRIES are f*cking PURPLE!!!"
Perfect video to watch now that I'm intoxicated and just want to sleep. Turn my world upside down again MatPat because I'm already everywhere and nowhere at the same time XD
Na it is just a flavor
PLEASE DO A OTTER POP LORE THEORY
otter pop lore please
Do an otter pop lore theory, please
Matpat saying "licking Ariel" is not a sentence I've ever thought I'd hear from his mouth
Today on unfunny man cherry-picks points to make you believe his theories: blue
My mom and sister have a sensitivity to red food dyes. So on Halloween I would always have to trade all my blue, yellow, and green candy for my sisters orange, red, and purple. Blue was my sister’s favourite. So anytime I actually got to keep my blue candy it was an extra special day! Blue raspberry has a very special place in my heart.
my love os a lie
im waiting for that otter-pop lore
as someone with epilepsy problems and I know I'm not the only one. I would love to see a video on aspartame, a sweetener found in diet soda, sugar-free gum,etc. is it really as dangerous as eplispy doctors say it is since it's a neurotoxin supposedly or no?
A nice meaty taste with some light hairs   That’s what blue tastes like  Kinda like a dog from a certain kids show
After learning how toxic indigo is I have a new respect for those guys who make real indigo jeans by hand
dude i love grape sour patch kids - best flavor by far
Melvin de Groote literally means Melvin the great, so fitting name then  And I´d like to know why banana doesn´t taste like real banana
From now on, I'm no longer calling "Blue Raspberry" its name but 'Blue Flavor', 'Bluekem", "Bluartiflave"... you get the deal
5:15 Theory disproven by matpat himself. Nothing else to see here 😏 (In all seriousness, I'm pleasantly surprised at the research put into this video, plus, i don't see any real arguments to be made against it, great job 👍)
Grape tastes like grape concord specifically
since i discovered food theory, i have been waiting for this video, i knew it would happen. this is way too common of a food mystery for it NOT to be a video.
What's funny is that I used to sell candy at my school, but I never had access to any blue raspberry flavoring, so instead, I would get ordinary raspberry flavoring and then add more citric acid to make it tarter. I don't know if that was what blue raspberry actually was, or if it was just placebo, but it tasted the same to me, and my customers.
Grape flavoring doesn't taste like Grape. It tastes like Purple.
Dan is my man. Stop bullying him!!!!
blue berry
No one is surprised
Blue is the best flavor. No questions about it. I will not argue and will die on this hill. 💙💙💙💙💙💙
the fact that m&ms did a colour contest with only the colours of the bi flag WITHOUT REALIZING IT is funny to me
Cool
I can say that I, for one, would watch a video on Otter Pops lore. New food theory?
Grape does taste like grape tho it's just Concorde grapes an u can't buy those in stores
Makes sense that Amoranth causes cancer.
Petition for Matt to start an otter pops lore theory  ⬇️
I won't lie,I would watch otter pops lore.
I’m just kidding I’m not gonna give you presents Siri I’m gonna give you restaurant theory
Love the editors suddenly making fun of matpat for mispronouncing vanilla
i love that pan flag snow cone <3
I always thought blue was bubblegum flavor newer liked blue flavours
Blueberries are purple
I usually go for an Icee mix of Blue Raspberry and either Cherry or Lemon/Lime I always wondered if there actually were blue raspberries or they were just dyed regulas raspberries 🤔 Glad this video answered me this 🫡
the flavor of blue is blue, duh
why did matpat have Romanian snow cone
⬇️ like for BLUE
I what a otter pop lore video
Channel. Going to rank up to all your channels. Now you’re going to the second rank you have for more tablets to put in I’ll give you wan person theory.
no wayyy, haha.. today I posted a video reacting to reddit memes and one of them was about the blue flavour and I said it's not a real thing, and then I get this on my recommended.
food theory idea: when people are sick, they are often given chicken noodle soup and soups in general. is there any actual medical reasoning behind this? also are there other foods that are a better or more effective?
hehe  bloo
OTERPOP LORE NOW
I think game theory needs a break for real He’s been doing so many theories
Concored grape taste like grape flavor...
Would otter pop lore theory be in food or film theory?
Hey, if blue raspberry isn't real, is pink lemonade real? And if so, why does it taste so much better than regular lemonade?
6:57 oh no matpat is having an existential  crisis.
4:05 BLUBERRIES ARE FU**IN PURPLE
sir please get out of my head, I was thinking about the blue razz flavor at EXACTLY the time that this was released!
OtterPop lore (real)
0:22 BLUE
do an otter pop lore please. hey, for the memes
Otterpop lore video
Meanwhile, somewhere in Australia, Randy Feltface is watching this video and screaming at his phone or computer "I fucking told you so!"
I love blue Lets see what it really is
blue.
Please do otter pop lore.
Yes do the otter pop lore please.
Do the otterpop lore man
i always thought bluerassberry was a mix between blue berrys and razzberry
I just called blue flavor, blueberry flavor
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that grape candy flavor is specifically trying to recreate Concord Grapes.
I can actually taste most colorings, especially blues and yellows, so I always thought that it was just the color and a regular raspberry color, maybe with some added citric acid.
Can someone explain why Baja Blast is so freaking good? And WHAT is the flavor and WHY does it taste "refreshing"?
*blue*
4:03 Randy Feltface: “BLUEBERRIES ARE F*CKING PURPLE!”
I already knew about this
I'd research it to be sure, but I believe that the "grape" flavor is actually based on certain *varieties* of grapes, just like "banana" tastes like a certain type of (now extinct afaik) banana.  Concord grapes, specifically, I believe.
BLUUUUUUUUUEEEEEEEE
At 4:50 seconds is when the into stops       Before that he was just talking about the history of it
Blue is my favorite flavor
Anytime someone asks me what flavor I got, I’m just saying “blue.” It doesn’t even have to be blue, I’m just gonna say I got blue😂 Thank you head editor Dan🩵
Blue 😐
I'd pay to see an Otter Pops theory.
not me watching this while drinking a blue raspberry slush
Do an otter pop lore pls
THE BLUES, JESSE! WE NEED TO COOK THE BLUES!
My favorite candy flavor is green apple. And once I grew up and old enough to drink, there's actually a beer that is flavored green apple and highly reminds me of the candy flavor. It's amazing, sour green apple is the best.
Blue raspberry and grape have always been my 2 favorite flavors they both take my number 1 position
Hi
blue
Please do an otter pop lore video
I've been waiting SO LONG for someone to finally say this
How ironic I was talking to my mom about that blue raspberry is not real.🤣😂👍🏻😅
I've been waiting for this to be covered! Thank you!
Blue ringed octopus go cuuuuuuute
So I guess I'm jumping down a rabbit hole about otter pops.
wow
OTTER POP LORE THEORY! OTTER POP LORE THEORY!
I’m sorry but are we just suppose to pretend that you didn’t say that thing about licking Ariel
These intros are getting crazier and crazier and funnier
Blue flavor best flavor
I relate to the beginning
Was this ever a mystery? Pretty sure everyone knows blue raspberry is just raspberry flavour paired with blue food dye. The main reason raspberry flavour is blue in many candies is to distinguish them from already established red and pink varieties like cherry, strawberry and watermelon. If you have both flavours in the same bag, and they're both red, no one can tell them apart.
Nothing beats the smell of fresh cut grass
Bluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue
The intro is just mwa
4:33 “Licking Ariel” 💀💀💀
Otter pop lore when?
GT intros are getting more and more unhinged and I love it
I just always assumed it was blueberry mixed with raspberry
blue
I WAS JUST THINKING THIS! My childhood is ruined
“I’m going to show you the literal blue pill.” So… viagra?
That beginning was so great! I'm like Dan, my favorite flavor is also blue xDD
My time has come.
The ocean is actually blue by any reasonable definition of something having a color. Water itself is a very pale blue, not enough to be noticeable most of the time, but it becomes clearly visible in large enough quantities.
I was waiting for a pink lemonade but blue suffices
Toxic waste candy has bee's wax in it! Why!?!?!?!?!?
I have never had a grape flavoured sweet but I'm now confused why y'all don't have blackcurrant? It's the best!
alexander the grape/10
blue raspberry  is the sweet version of raspberry
OTTER POP LORE OTTER POP LORE
Actually you should look into the orgins of grape flavor because you'll be surprised tbat there actually are grapes that taste like grape
I never choose over the flavor I just choose over which one was my favorite color 😞
omg i need an otterpop lore theory in my life PLEASE
10:31 it is so true like 5yo me though Froot Loops were all different flavors and I hated yellow 😅
Blue berry raspberry mix flavor
You might say that Editor Dan... blue it.
Talk about a SOUR episode XD!!!
Something tells me Mat has never had a Concord grape before.
New theory!!! Howd the guy that touches anything and it turns into Skittles how'd he get them?(I'm talking about a skittle add)
Please actally do the otter pop lore that would be so funny
When I saw the powder, my immediate thought was “CRACK!”
Blue Poison Dart Frogs (Dendrobates tinctorius azures) like all other poison dart frogs are only poisonous in the wild. If captive bred, they are not poisonous, as their poison only comes from the stuff they eat out in the wild :) Just a fun fact.
Vote to make blue the color of danger & death again rather than the color of sadness, calmness & depression. This is 1000% a Sigma Vs Chad moment.
Idk if this qualifies for a Style Theory but:  As an extension to blue flavor, blue candles are all detergent.  Seriously, go to a Yankee Candle and smell every candle with blue coloring. It all just smells like laundry detergent.
does that mean my fav flavor is a lie..?
I NEED OTTER POP LORE!!!!   FEED MY BRAIN
*_BLUE FLAVOR!!!_*
i thought my whole blue raspberry was another name for bluberry i even asked my parents why is it called blue rasberry if its purple
Mat could make me believe the earth is a lie
This man can make my brain hurt anytime he wants
Can ya do a loganberry one someday?
So I was not the only one questioning if this is a real berry and I knew it was a lie!
not watching the video. blue is a flavor people just don’t want to admit it 🙄              this is a joke pls
I’ve been thinking of this forever now and you just made the randomest video on the randomest channel which turns out is exactly what I need 😅
Blue Raspberry is a lie! Blue Raspberry is a lie! Blue Raspberry is a lie! Blue Raspberry is a lie!
Tastes like light blue
matpat saying “it’s kinda sending me right now” caught me so off guard
When I was a child, I googled if blue raspberries existed. And God did I ever search. But alas, I deduced at the time blue raspberry flavoring had to of been some made up artifical flavoring 😅
chill matt 4:37
The introoooo yayyyyy!
Blue raspberry tastes like blue the color
Brayden can't have blue!
Whatever it is; I love the flavour blue
Sequel episode: What flavor is Blue Moon ice cream?
Grape flavors do indeed taste like grapes, concord grapes tho.
Bluebarriers are purple
“Blue. Blue. Is blue. Blue. Blue. Blueeeeeeee.” -the one and only Head Editor Dan
Blueberries are f***ing purple!
Or!!! What if the same thing that happened to banana flavored stuff is happening with the blue raspberry??? We just don't have them anymore. They were too delicious and we ate them all
Matpat just started questioning his existence out of nowhere
blue
I want a pan snowcone like matpat had in the intro now ;-;
Blue
The flavor of blue is what it feels like to look at blue with citrus acid to remind us the danger.
how do red m&m gone while I eating a red m&m
Tracking my texts, Mat Pat? I just referenced this earlier...
do a otter pop lore ow
mat pat needs to do a video on the differences between food standards between us and uk. especially to do with colours. as someone who's allergic to unnatural/artificial red food dyes, finding red american sweets i can eat is fairly difficult, whereas in the uk it pretty easy as most of our sweets are made with fruit juice or coloured with paprika, beetroot or carrots. plus are labelled pretty clearly as without artificial flavours.  would be a pretty interesting video
Didn’t Dan leave or something? Somebody left, and I feel like it’s him.
Brayden can't have blue  BLUEBERRIES ARE FUCKING PURPLE!!!!
For the longest time I thought blue raspberry was just blueberry and raspberry put into one flavor
Actually company named Research in motion started all this illusion blueberry 😂
3:47 Aphmau SMACKING the other editor is hilarious!!!
6:07 reminds me of the time when I was in Palm Springs with my friend and my brother and her little sister. We had a whole box of otter pops so we put them all in the hot tub to make them melt. My brother and my friends little sister would swim and try to get them out. My friend and I cut open the melted otter pops and put them all into a pitcher to make a giant juice. Then we all took straws and started drinking it out of the pitcher.
4:03 Common misconception. Blueberries are not actually blue. They are purple. It is the waxy coating on them that provides an optical illusion making them appear blue, but rub that wax a bit and it reveals the berries true colour: purple.
Grape and Watermelon are my favorite candy flavors, despite not tasting like the fruits.
Yeaahh licking Ariel is salty....
So since you have all 4 parts of the theory ring now what’s GT live? Is it just not part of it?????
M1 m1 m1 m1 m1
omg Blue Flavor is WOKE!
Blue
I personally like the red flavor😂
Blueberries are PURPLE!
When he jest started saying blue I brought my mind to the blue flavor form chickennuget
Not watching you slander the best flavor for 13 mins.
please investigate why blue Doritoes have disappeared from German stores
BLUEBERRIES ARE F*CKING PUEPLE
12:41: No, It’s Not. This Is a True about Lie Crime of NOT-Blue Raspberry-Flavour Chemistry ⚛️ 🧪 Fact.
Matpat can you do a video about Şiş kebab it would be very cool
banana tastes exactly like banana, well not the current version of banana but the old ones...
I only knew of a couple of the blue things I was so shocked because I always grab red things, because for me they always had the best flavor
da ba dee da ba dah
1:47 how do people test these things
Can we pleeeeeease get a video or a short on how to properly put utensils in the dishwasher, like is it better to be have the handle up and out or the handle down with the actual part that touches the food out
Blue
That intro 😂😂😂 blue
Do it, MatPat. Make an OtterPops lore episode.
blue
Blue is pretty. That’s it.
it doesn't taste anything like raspberries. the flavor is just blue.
6:44 MatPat has gotta stop trying to use new slang 😂
The intro had me choking on my own spit omfg
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus_leucodermis
👇petition for MatPat to make an OtterPop theory video👇
Before starting a new lore can you finished the omega mart lore before? (It’s really à demand if you don’t actually do it I don’t care just that I love your way of searching with all the people you age and so I don’t have to do the research myself I’m lazy.)
please make a otter pops lore video
Yes, "grape" flavoured things are the same. They're not graped flavour, they're purple flavour.
Otter pop episode plz
we need a theory on otterpops
I do agree with Dan that blue is a flavor
It’s a blueberry
We use way too much artificial flavoring.  There are kids that really don't know what the fruit their artificially flavored candies are based on actually taste like.
It’s blueberry
but I like blue raspberry
I would be all here for the otterpop food theory lmao
Blue
Am I the only one thinking cool blue Gatorade looks like if washer fluid had a flavor.
First vanilla, now raspberry, I have a sneaking suspicion that a ‘what flavour is bubblegum actually supposed to be?’ Theory is brewing
Tough tho, i think fake blue raspberries images look cool, next time I'll ask god to add it 😎
I always assumed it was one of those flavors that was just a bizzare combination of 2 other pre-existing flavors, like blueberries and raspberry or something. Then they just shortened it to “blue raspberry”.
Am I hallucinating or has the theme song for this channel been gone for a while up until this video? Is it back?
One word. Blue
Blue is my favorite flavor too
I have no idea what Otto Pops are but I hope there is lore and want an episode! 🤣
I would love to see a theory on why my favorite ice cream, mint chocolate chip, is green and how peppermint is so different from regular mint. (Because I don't care for peppermint).
As a person who eats blue raspberry stuff, i love this video.
cherry doesn't taste like cherry.  But Strawberry tastes like strawberry
Me who Is drinking a Blue Raspberry slushie whilst watching this: 😳👀👁👄👁
10:17 "Most people couldn't identify a soda as grape flavored unless it was colored purple" 'Grape' was the first artificial flavor. A chemical compound that was later discovered to be naturally occurring in a variety of fruits including grapes.
Make otter pops theory
Do an Otter Pop theory please!!! 😂
I've always known there were no blue raspberries. It just tastes good lol.
B          L            U         E
what if blue raspberry flavor is actually a mix of blueberries and raspberries
Matpat is nearing the reason we exist and what light “Actually” is
I was told as a kid that there was a guy with too much blue dye and raspberry product and didn't want it to go to waste
Isn't grape flavor just based off a different type of grapes then the type you normal buy?
I like banana or coconut snow cones myself. It depended on if I felt like eating something that looked like it had no flavoring at all or eating something that my parents told me not to eat ("Don't you eat that yellow snow!")
Otter pop lore theory please! It drives me crazy that Skittles doesn’t have a blue (or indigo) in the regular red bag. Tropical and other specialty bags don’t count. How can you truly taste the rainbow if there is no blue (or indigo)?
*insert randy feltface blueberries clip here*
blue and green apple is best sno cone Flavour
I ironically ate some ice cream from an ice cream truck I started questioning if it was “blue raspberry” and this video came up and helped me thanks
So at this point it really does just taste..... Blue.
Matpat probably just doesn't like the blue raspberry and felt the need to rant about it.
blueberries are purple
I never associated raspberry with anything but red or pink. I guess this whole blue raspberry is an only US thing?
Honestly I would watch an otter pops lore episode
Blue used to be toilet puck water color and feminine pad absorbancy  demonstration liquid color.  😶
Blue raspberry tastes like Sourness!
Blueberries are fucking purple- randy feltface
4:32 phrasing
I love matpat eating a pansexual snow cone
Grape flavor tastes like purple Sour apple tastes like green Blue raspberry tastes like blue These flavors do not taste like foods, but they're tasty anyway
Me and the first thing I thought: well blue raspberry isn’t a real berry so the real flavor would probably be sour raspberry like regular raspberry but sour like a little sour and what if people actually injected blue dye into a regular raspberry and it turned blue and then people thought they really did exist🤌
Lol licking Ariel 😂😂
Swear you released a video like this and the flavor turned out to be pineapple. If I’m right, then I got this for my dream.
i was waiting for "I am DeGroot!"
Blue, blue, blue
wtf what sick artifical flavors do muricans eat? disgusting
I always loved blue raspberry as a kid
blue
never take away my theme song intro again pwease :(((
I demamd Otter Pop Lore theory!
It's still my favorite flavor don't we all know it's just a bunch of different mixes
Im surprise that no one noticed that in the picture he put for the otter pops characters the name cosmic coconut is at the otter that looks like a cosmic coconut and it’s a the otter that is probably lemon
YAY AN INTRO
I love blue raspberries but I never thought it was a real fruit or tasted like raspberries.  Why?  Because I hate raspberries.
Grape candy and soda is made to taste like concord grapes.
BLUUUUUUUUUUEEEEEEEEEEE    Also, I agree with Amy's choice.
I'm kind of amused that some people think blue raspberry is a real flavor. And it's even more funny when I see something that says it is naturally flavored but has the blue raspberry flavor
did people think blue rasberries were real?
I can confirm that blue is an absurdly popular flavor in candy. There were entire battle royales fought in school over the few blue jolly ranchers in the teacher's prize dish
Even if blue isn't a real flavor, I love blue.
Sour patch debate LEMON IS SUPERIOR
I am totally down for Otter Pop lore.
HEY HEY HEY  blue m&m's are the best flavor of m&m's me and half my class agree
hank green actually made a youtube short/tiktok on the grape flavor, that its trying to mimic concord grapes specifically, though you are right that its purely artificial and not fully accurate. much like how banana candy flavors try to mimic the Gros Michel banana, which has since died out, and left us with the cavendish banana
Did I need to know otter pops lore 7 minutes ago, no. Do I now? you betcha.
Neither strawberries, nor raspberries are technically berries, but bananas are. Coconuts are not nuts nor are peanuts. And no one is entirely sure what exactly a tree is besides the fact that they kind of look similar.
This is more accurate a
blue
I’m a grape guy too
Hey, if orange can be a colour and a flavour - why NOT blue?  Don’t let your memes be dreams, folks!
blue
blue
dan saying blue isnt funny
7:30 Green Could Also Be Lime
blue
I disapprove , blue raspberry is real , if you never seen it in real life how can you be sure I'm not talking about the fruit I'm talking about the flavor , it's made with red raspberry mixed with blue berry and blue pigments
blue
Otteepops are so fucking good
i agree with dan
Unpopular opinion lemon is the best flavor of Gatorade
No blue foods, blue berries are purple
I remember Cracked saying that blue raspberry came from a gland in beaver butts. This explanation is ... considerably more mundane.
I don't even like blue.
Tbh I never really like blue food/candy
3
Fortnite minis and chugs jugs all in one color
Grape is the most basic flavour of all time, I absolutely despise it
1:36 actually blue butterflies aren’t even blue, I think if you get it wet you see theres no pigment its just light reflection mambo jumbo   like veins, they’re not blue
Matpat not referencing the M&M's campaign was called M&Mpire State; also Wildberry isn't mentioned ONCE 🧐
No blue raspberry is a real flavor
The elusive blue raspberry
Never thought I’d hear Matpat say “it’s kind of sending me rn”
him: ITS A LIE! DONT BELIEVE IT!  *me who shoves 4 of 5 in my mouth at the same time when i eat them* : oh i could not tell the difference.
blue.
please do an otterpop lore theory
Blue
FINALLY another grape finatic.
Bluuuuuuuuuuue !
Honestly, I think that MatPat will eventually cover a topic that's a little too controversial and get himself assasinated
"BLUEBERRIES ARE F*CKING PURPLE!" - Randy Feltface 😅
you do have to do otterpop lore
I just figured it was bcs of the fact that they needed a new colour for raspberries like you said mixed with the fact they wanted a colour as energetic as artificial rasperry would want to present itself as being.
Anything Blue Raspberry flavored I just say the blue one every time😂😅
Purple is also a flavor cus it’s amazing but dose not taste like grape it’s just the taste of purple
please make an otterpops lore video,, it would be amazing
What? Wait I want pink and purple mnm's
1:43 no way i saw a who would win animsls vs other animals the blu ring octopus LITERALLY KILLED A SHARK
Artificial grape has and forever will taste like purple
One of my favourite drinks to get is a flavoured carbonated water, and (until recently) they had "Blue Raspberry" as a flavour. The thing is every flavour of this water is clear, rather than coloured. Take the labels off, and the only way you'd know the difference is smell and/or taste.  So I took to referring to it as "clear blue raspberry" in much the same way someone talks about the "invisible pink unicorn."
lol 18(69)
Why is Matt's snow cone pan?
I just had otter pops at school today
Can you die of sour stuff
Yeah i love grape
I haven't eaten a blue pop in decades.  I remember it tasting like nothing more than bubble solution (e.g. liquid dish soap).
Did you know that artificial banana flavor is patterned after the Cavendish banana and not the modern banana?
i  havent watch the video yet but i agree with dan. blue is good. i love blue food. hehe
Grape flavor is liek Concord grapes.. not modern seedless tabel grape varieties. the rest of the world eats real grapes, you live in NC where there are wild grapes with thicker skins and seeds that taste more like grape than the oens you showed in the video and compared to la croix. I recommend you try whole foods for concord grapes in the summer. I'm sure they would have some unless you have one of the fancier Harris Teeter's near you.
grape flavored candy tastes kinda like concord grapes
Blue is ABSOLUTELY a flavor and you cant convince me otherwise
Today, immediately after coming back from school (during the ride home we stopped at McDonalds, so idk why she was so hungry) my 9-year-old charge went directly to her fridge and pulled out blue raspberry Sourpatch kids Jello. I've known for a long time that my favorite flavor which is my favorite color was bullshit. But I didn't tell her because MatPat, you may as well be telling kids "Santa isn't real" Oddly enough, her sister also had an otter pop. Go figure.
the grape thing is already done, NileRed made grape flavor from gloves or something
BLUE FLAVOR!!
Thank you so much for todays video. Now I challenge you to deep dive in the flavor “bubble gum“!
2:38 I remember that happened! I was I think 6 maybe? Blue has always been a favorite color of mine! 3:32 Blue raspberry tastes like a combination of a blackberry and a raspberry to me. Slightly sour, a good sweetness and an awesome color. (Cool Blue tastes like watered down blueberries to me) 4:30 I did not know these flavors existed and now I need to try them. Dragon first! 6:06 Yep. ICEE was a BIG part of my life as a kid. Every time we stopped at gas station that had a machine, we got one. I always got Blue Razz or Cherry or sometimes mixed them together. Those are my favorite flavors, absolutely top tier. We don’t do artificial stuff anymore. No sweeteners, colors or flavors! Having a job at a grocery store really taught me a lot of stuff I didn’t know beforehand and the people were extremely nice which helped make friends easier. Now we look at the ingredients first to see what’s in there! If there’s HFCS, anything artificial, even the Bioengineered Food Ingredients we DO NOT buy! Limits the choices when you’re shopping but is overall better for you in the end.
I’ve always wondered about the blue raspberry flavor
Wait. So blue rasberry isn't just rasberry x blue colouring??
I think  that the true maverick, first to make it to blue rasberry was  the company that sold what were called "quater waters" cheap drinks that that use to be sold in supermarkets and NYC public schools in the 80's . They were sold in short plastic bottles squared at the bottom  and the lid was just a piece of foil that was torn off   Fron a time before actual water was mass marketed in individual  servings
Actually I think its blueberry mixed with raspberry
Over here in my country, we DO actually use blueberry flavor with blue food. I've never even been aware of blue raspberry until I shopped at an international candy store that imported American candy.
Being Scottish blue is always bubblegum flavour to me.
Hmm, so you eat the red ones last because you die after.. makes sense
Haven’t watched so I’ll find out in a sec but wasn’t blue raspberry a result of already having a red colored candy like cherry or strawberry, and now some companies just mix blueberry and raspberry flavors together and call it the same name
6:06 OTTER POPS 💙❤💚🧡 I was starting to think they were a local state produced product the way nobody ever knew what they were when I mentioned them........
What is the flavor of Bubble Gum?
Blueberries are probably the closest blue thing to blue flavor. Soft and tart, but you gotta get them a little fresh. They're _painfully_ tart when they're brand new, and soften over time. Gotta get a sweet spot to get a blue raspberry-esque flavor.
Okey which flavor do you want   Blue flavor!   Blue is not a flavor   BLUE FLAVOOOOORRRRRR!
blue.
Make a whole series on artificial flavor histories please.
2:17 bro really said eat it up
not me eating blue raspberry sour patch kids while watching this
When you say banana flavor tho do you mean actual banana or artificial banana bc those are very different flavors
Hi! I am a fan and I have an idea for a game theory video. I think there is lore in baby in yellow game.
i feel like you could do an episode on where all the artificial flavors come from
Alright I watched through the whole video before making this comment because with the title and thumbnail I wanted to say something right of the bat but I wanted to make sure I was being fair. Honestly I didn't want to watch it (I'll explain in a min) but I remembered that the titles of these videos have a pattern of saying something weird just to get your attention. Generally though they make me specifically not want to watch them. I love the video, I myself have wandered what flavor Blue Raspberry actually is but to get to my point.... Everyone who isn't a child already knows blue raspberry is an artificial flavor. We all know "blue" raspberries aren't a thing. So when I read the title and thumbnail I just thought "Well duh, everyone who's out of middle school knows that. Who actually thinks blue raspberry is a real fruit?". And the title "Blue raspberry is a Complete LIE!" made me think the video was just going to be him proving that Blue Raspberry is entirely chemicals which I already knew so I didn't feel a need to watch it. I only decided to because I wanted to point it out, but all the way through just to see if he was going to point out the obvious title. But now I know the "flavor" of Blue Raspberry, though I could already tell it wasn't anything close to raspberry itself. Still love it though, but not nearly as I love Red velvet, heh. Maybe he'll do a theory on the current red food dye used today, Red Dye 40? A person I know swears this red dye also causes cancer.
6:57 YES! YES. 100% YES!
Grape does taste like grape. Concord grape. Regular table grapes don’t have much taste so they mimic the more flavorful concord variety
Blue is blue flavored
Fake flavour 👀?! Ohhh they won't be pleased to hear this, was suppose to be a sekret (Kekw) Whatever it is, it's still going to taste sweet for most individuals. This looked lik an interesting deep dive to get to the bottom of the flavour itself. Great Work Team. Hope your doing well, Keep Being Awesome Bro 🫐 😎 👊
Them otter pops I just snap them in half if completely frozen then you have 2 lolies
The best flavour i've seen yet is "unicorn poop"
"now we know what lickug Ariel tastes like" Did anybody mention that this sounds kinds weird or is it just me :D?
Ive found that in the past if you eat fresh concord grapes its tastes pretty close to grape flavoring
you should add banana in the grape theory
I agree with Dan. Blue.
knew it
the into needs to go on a t shirt
My name is Blu
Blue Gatorade taste like kiwi  It’s sour sweet and refreshing like a kiwi
The ‘it’s all just a theory’ line becomes less and less true with every video. That ain’t a theory, he’s just spitting facts now
But... But... I thought the empire state building was lit up blue because of Percy jackson😢
I absolutely love seeing more of team theorist in videos after they appeared on the couch over on gtlive :D
I assumed it was just blueberry/raspberry lol
Blue is ABSOLUTELY a flavour.  When I was a kid and used to go to "Canada's Wonderland" they used to have smurf ice cream.  It was blue soft serve and it 100%, positively, definitely tasted like blue.  it wasn't raspberry or anything stupid like that but it WAS blue.  Anyone who ever went there and has one of these cones knows what I'm talking about.
Argue with me if you want... but blueberry's are purple 0-0
I’m pretty sure we all knew that but I like his theory’s so I’ll go with the flow
MatPat judging Dan’s blue flavor despite his snow one having blue on it smh
THE INTROS ARE BACKKKK
I stopped the video at blue raspberry is not real just to comment. Blue raspberry has always been my favorite flavor and now your telling me it's not a flavor mixture of blueberries and raspberries!
Blueberries are actually blue though; they're purple.
Blueberries. That's it.
When I see I blue flavor my brain just thinks of the flavor blueberry
blue 🔵
Blackberries feel slighted!
I think that you should do a theory on banana flavoring.
Why does blue raspberry look alien now ....
'Grape' tastes like 'Purple'
😂 My mom and I were just wondering about this.
Dan said blue so many times I felt like blue wasn’t a flavor Edit: WORD I MEANT WORD NOT FLAVOR
4:32 😳😯😦😧😮😲😵🙀
Food theory suggestion: I heard once that artificial banana flavor, like in a Now & Later, is actually closer to the original flavor of bananas before they started artificially selecting them for better yields. I've further heard that all bananas sold today are clones of the same strain, so if there is an outbreak of banana plague, we will just have no more bananas ever.
Blue
Ruined my childhood again matpat good job
Yes. Amaranth is poison. Eye candy, but still poison.
Blu
Is Ice Cream An Option?
The concoction of blue raspberry is a mixture of raspberry pears and blueberries so they took the blue from blue berries and additive raspberry to get blue raspberry
This is fairly common knowledge
Seems pretty factually backed up for a theory
You totes have to do a Otter Pop lore video now
I always thought blue raspberry was blueberry and raspberry together.
E
Matpat got a Chad/Romania snow cone (please laugh)
BLUE!
9.6666 thousand likes an hour
Imagine if someone manages to artificially create an actual blue raspberry plant
Grape flavor actually comes from concord grapes, which is why grape jelly tastes the way it does, the grapes that we eat that are normally found in the grocery store are dinner grapes, hence why they don't taste like grape flavor
I want more Muscat grape flavor and smell in my food :|
But there IS a blue(-ish) raspberry! It's called "salmbär" or "blå hallon" which literally translates to blue raspberry. It grows in Sweden and Finland and is different from blackberries. 😅
Dont forget about a blue Waffle...   LOL
Blue what? Blue
Blue
I would love a otter pop lore theory
blue tasts blue
I watch as  I literally eat blue jolly ranchers🤣
6:00 relatable
I would die for there to actually be a real blue raspberry though
Blue
My cat is called Blue and he keeps looking so confused at who keeps calling him
Ah yes, another purple coinsure, very good
fooooood theory idea:does taco bell really makes you have diarrhea
you just figuring this out?
Please do an Otter Pop lore video, I'm sure there is some somewhere, there's lore for everything ✨
Otter pop lore, you very much have to. You came across a rabbit hole now you gotta go down it.
Or how artificial banana doesn't taste like banana
Blue
Fruit loops have no flavor add to them.
My favorite ice cream is Vanilla BEAN
You should understand, that you are only talking from a US-standpoint. Unnatural colors in food are usually not well received. But since in the US they feed you unnaturally colored stuff from an early age, you find it appetizing. The rest of the world doesnt agree
Matpat, you need to make an episode about why artificial banana doesnt taste like bananas.
Blue
Literally drinking a cool blue gatorade rn and tbh it kinda tastes like orange???
As someone who loves blue raspberry, this makes it even better the fact that they use something like caramel and balance it out with tart:))
BLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUE!!!!!!!
Random fact, I saw the sour patch kids and they reminded me of jelly babies, the reason this is important is because it reminded me of in middle school when we did a jelly baby experiment with fire, and our teacher set the fire alarm off on her first week of teaching,   It was the jelly baby’s revenge (R.I.P Jerry)
I used to think that grape-flavored things didn't taste like grape, but then I had the Concord grape. That's apparently what they base the flavor off of.
I can't believe you are really out here disrespecting Otter Pops. You better put together that Otter Pop lore video to apologize-
Banana doesn’t taste exactly like banana either, include that in the part 2 with grape 😮
Why do I feel that if Percy was watching this he would be in love with the Empire State Building being lit up blue, but also upset he didn’t see it; and with all the blue foods. But he might not like the way Mat is talking about blue, and blue foods.
is it lemon?
4:34  Ayo nah why he imagining what Ariel tastes like 😳
There is actually a real plant that is "Blue Raspberry"!!! Yes the artificial flavor called that is manufactured. But there is a real plant!  (Edit) This comment was posted at 2 minute mark.
Anyone else thought Airup was going to sponsor this video?
I thought Blue raspberry is a mix of blueberry and raspberry
An Otter Pops episode would be great
*I knew something was a little sour.*
NOT ME LITERALLY DRINKING A BLUE RASPBERRY SLUSHIE WITH NERDS FROM SONIC AS I SEE THIS VIDEO
You wanna know how I got these scars?..... eating Otter Pops.
I love your videos, but you should know that Thomas Edison was actually a fraud. For example, he took Tesla’s invention but didn’t pay home. HE DIDN’T EVEN INVENT THE LIGHT BLULB! He bought it off two people. But no offense to you, I just wanted you to know.
"Now we know what licking Arielle would taste like." Comment of the year!
Blue
Matpat, this doesn’t need explaining, please…
Also the dragon yogurt tastes like crap
I relate with Dan so much in the intro!
If you're Haribo, green goes to strawberry, actually had a whole discussion about this in a Pokemon shiny hunters group because shiny Tediursa & Ursaring are green so I had to explain & provide evidence that they're strawberry flavored if they were gummy bears. I kid you not, this conversation went on for hours & even got brought up again a few days later.  Now that we know about blue raspberry, can someone please answer me this, what is a fufu berry? This flavor of Jones Soda is the best but fufu berries aren't a real thing, are they? This is a true mystery, I did hear that Jesus originally turned water into fufu berry Jones Soda but then it later spoiled into wine, can't trust what you read online lol. If it's not a miracle creation from Jesus, what really makes up fufu berry?
I love blue. It's my favorite flavor.
b l u e
Yes! Please do an episode on how Grape flavor tastes nothing like real grapes.
The flavor is blueberry
I vote yes to otter pop lore episode!
Grape doesn't taste like grape, it tastes like purple.
I already knew a bunch of this cause I had a mental crises at 7 wondering what exactly is blue raspberry if there is no blue raspberry in the real world... In the end I just accepted it but hated it for now reason at all. I say this wearing "blue". Cherry is better and the best artificial flavoring.
Not going to lie. I feel like the candy versions of any fruit flavor are going to be as I like to call it cartoonified they're going to be not super accurate. They're going to emphasize certain parts and downplay others. So you know like how much like a actual bunny does bugs Bunny really look seriously? That's what I'm saying so this is basically loosely based on raspberry and it's delicious
My dad grows raspberry so I pretty much know the flavour and honestly yeah those things don't taste like raspberry but how many 'fruit' flavour sweets actually taste like the fruit. Practically none lol
there is a gatorade flavor named blue cherry!!! u should try to solve that
“a theory” “a” BLUE “ food theory”   oh no blue theory
Blue 😐
I dont care if blue raspberry isn't real its still a good flavor
I love how often I can watch a new MatPat video!
You should do a theory on why banana flavored things don't taste like bananas! I heard that it was because bananas are clones and banana flavored things tasted like an extinct version of bananas. I don't know if that is true, but I do think it would make a good episode!
As someone who's training to become a flavor chemist I have mixed feelings about this episode. I love it because it shows cool, interesting facts about flavor chemistry and it's history, but now if I meet someone new and they've seen this video they won't be as interested in hearing me talk about the origins of blue raspberry. lol
MAT PLEASE, I WOULD WATCH THE OTTER POPS LORE SO HARD PLEASE
Before I even watch the video:  I already knew it was fake, but boy, I love me some blue raspberry.  But I also love real raspberries too.  Different flavors, both yummy.   After watching it:. Great video as always.  I am not a fan of "fake" grape or cherry, they taste too much like medicines to me.  I like the fake blue raspberry, fake watermelon, or fake lime.  Also have never heard of otter pops, at least where I lived in New England.  It was always Fla-vor-ice.
I watched this at 2x speed and I've never been more stressed
What’s the deal with raspberries, strawberries, and few others with berry suffix being drupe or agate fruit some kind not actual berry? Blueberries, avocados, peppers, cherries, bananas, etc is categorized as berries.
Expected MatPat to try and prove Blue Raspberry to be real using parallel universes.
Do it please
Yes you now need to make a theory of otter pops do it
Honestly, the banana one is the only flavor compound that surprised me.
Blue.
Grape flavor does in fact, taste like grape just not table grapes. Grape flavoring is meant to mimic Concord grapes which taste exactly like the grape flavoring. Taste a Concord grape and tell me it does not taste exactly like grape candy.😂
Raspberry+Blueberry=Blue Raspberry
I made a fictional character named the blue eyes who just wants to see everything burn
I've known this since I was 5

No matter what we know red sour patch kids are on top
Artificial grape is disgusting!!
Head Editor Dan once again proving that he is the unequivocally greatest member of Team Theorist.
I really like this script more than usual
PLEASE i neeed to see an otterpop theory
I want the otter pop lore
wow
Would blue eyes be considered natural blue or would it be the same as the ocean and the sky just light reflecting in particular ways?
Based Dan
Blue is my favorite color
i always thought blue raspberry was a blend of blueberry and raspberry...
Yo! Just snap those kinda popsicles in half to open without scissors.
Water is actually blue.
Color is a flavor. It's the law of the kids, since the ancient.
I’ve always hated blue raspberry as a flavor, so this was a cool video to watch. I just don’t like the flavor, and seeing what actually goes into it is interesting.
Wow I was JUST thinking about Blue Raspberry a few days ago, wondering if it's actually a flavour.  Also do the Grape theory, it's my favorite too. :)
I consume the plaster flavour for my, uh, I don't know what they are; they aren't as popular in the UK.
**Reads title** Yeah, Matt. Nobody was questioning that. 😂
I'm pretty sure this blue raspberry thing only really exists in the states, I never came across or knew about it in my entire life until I went there for a vacation. So not that shocking, ya'll are just wack
Yes otter pop lore!
1: blue flavor is best flavor, no questions asked 2: to help you on your future endeavors with grape not tasting like grape, know that there used to be other breeds of grape that went extinct before we were born
I've never even heard of otter pops 💀💀💀💀
Hahha, you missed april fools a little.
When I met my wife she told me that she doesn't eat blue food because "Blue food doesn't exist." I have still yet to be able to find a food that is 100% natural and that is normally blue and she has still yet to eat anything blue.
Blue sky is positive? Absolutely not. Sunny blue skies are the beginning of a horrible day.  Give me gray rainy days every day.
Otterpop lore is going to be the new grubhub lore 🤣
Petition for otter pop lore theory video  | V
OTTER POP LORE?!? 0_0 I smell a Food Theory brewin! ^_6
Indigo? Well where's he going?
yo, he legit talks about going down on ariel hahahahahahahahaahha
Blueberries are purple.
Blue
Probably why I hate it so much. Fake flavor
YES!!! Grape is the best flavor! I know it doesn't taste like grape and I don't care.
Would you ever do a theory on jelly beans… so many flavors for that one
Ariel Bathwater flavor???
Okay but a La Croix tastes exactly like "something that sat next to something sweet a week ago" Also a lot of raspberry flavored things use pear and pineapple because reasons..
As soon as I heard about this (last summer) I knew it would eventually become a food theory video
Does that mean the flavor Blue Lagoon is just Blue Raspberry with less chemicals?
I thought it was like a mix of blackberries and grapes or blueberries
Never heard of blue raspberry flavour before. Not sure if I've been living under a rock or if that's just mainly a US thing. In some parts of Europe we have blue ice cream but that's usually vanilla or bubble gum flavoured. I do remember Fanta once introduced a blue variant but it tasted pretty bad. Not even sure what kind of flavour that was supposed to be xD.
Are we not gonna talk about how bubblegum has literally no flavor, it’s literally just sugar, so what’s that flavor?
blue
I definitely want an otter pop lore episode mat can make anything interesting even dirt
Looks like Matt took a page out of Chiknnuggets books with that skit in the first half!
Blue tastes like cool ranch.
Yes do a otter pops lore episode
Head editor Dan gives icebear from we bare bears. 🌟
Just a thought but… Blueberry + Raspberry = Blue Raspberry? At least that’s what I always thought.
#blue was made for this vid
Feels like a food/ style theory thing. He’s conboning all 4 for ultimate theory 😐😐😐 like thanos theory
I mean if the ice cream at the store was called just "blue" I would buy it every day 😅
aun me cae bien matpat, pero no se porque lo siento cada ves mas castroso.
Why has no one ever talked about this
the closest fruit to grape flavor is the Concord grape.
watermelon never tasted like watermelon to me
Hue-manity, really matpat.
Please do an Otter Pops lore video
who else loves amy
Im not joking, we have blue raspberry in our garden they are literally the same as red red raspberry but dark blue and taste way better, they grow on a very spiky bush that always cuts your a little when you pick them but and only grow in july and august. They are way better than red raspberry, id ear over 1000 in an hour of those and id be filled with red ones after 20-30.
I don’t care if it’s not a real flavor. It’s the best flavor
Yes, Matthew, we do want an Otter Pop lore episode!
Chocolate sauce goes well on hot wings. I said what I said.
Yeah I don't think I want to know what Ariel tastes like, you know that clam tastes like rotting fish 🐟🍑🤢
I had been hoping you'd make a video like this!
As Randy Feltface said "Blueberries are F$@&ing purple" sure they may give off a blue tinge from a far but actually they more resemble a very dark shade of blueish purple
Grape flavor actually tastes like Concord grapes
Growing up in UK blue things were normally bubblegum flavoured. Remember loving those drinks that came with a wee red straw to pop the top. Blue ones made your poop green 😂
I've always known blue raspberries aren't real but it'll still always be my favorite flavor of candy ❤
Fun fact: banana flavored things don’t taste like banana, because it’s a type of banana that no longer exists.   I’m allergic to most blue (and by default green and purple) food coloring. You’d think it’s easy to avoid those colors but man, you’ve nvr had Cap’n Crunch😭
Am I the only one who immediately started thinking about blue coconut before the intro even finished?
Actualy the blue raspberry is called a blueberrym..
I've honestly never understood everyone's obsession with blue raspberry flavored stuff. I've always found blue raspberry and artificial red raspberry way too sweet. I really like actual raspberries, but I feel like the artificial raspberry flavor is so far from what I actually like about the fruit.
You could always do a geometry dash lore theory
Who else loves Matpat little skits before the start of every video
STYLE THERoy
What is blue raspberry? Sara sara no mi  - Weeb What is blue raspberry? flavour of wild blackcap berry - intellectual what is blue raspberry? *5th colour of the rainbow* coated raspberry - me
Angry Joe Show: "BLUE! $60 for BLUE!"
my favorite color is raspberry and my favorite flavor is blue

The flavor of blue is blue
My nana refuses to eat anything blue
Where's the Frank Reynolds clips
I demand OtterPop lore theory
Blue…
I remember when the blue raspberry blo-pops came out, the lolly pops with bubble gum in the middle. Everyone was hoping to get that flavor in their Halloween bags that year. I don't remember ever getting a raspberry one of the other color, so it must have been a sort of unpopular flavor.
Okay, but red is the best sour patch kids flavor.
Not interesting fact, i was the 216,830th person to watch this video
But let’s be honest Blue and red are the only colors that have their own flavor if you ask me what flavor of lollipop I got I would just say red flavor if it was cherry if it was blue raspberry I just skip through flavor
Blue flavour is the best flavour
Otterpops?
I’d love to see a video on the history of Kraft cheese. Is it plastic? Sounds weird but look deeper
You called me out.
Otter pop lore video would be awesome
🌬️Bluuuuuuuuuue😶‍🌫️

Blueberries aren't even blue. They're purple.
Blue ringed octopus shout out and you gonna die if touch
This episode of Food Theory was sponsored by Percy Jackson. Not the series, the Seaweed Brain himself.
Matt... That butterfly you chose has a structural blue, not a pigment blue...
Blue raspberry sucks!  Also funny how Blue in nature is used a lot for toxic. Like Twitter
Please do an otter pop lore video!
hi
8:26 yes very true, she does
Other pop theory something that’s is worth mi time
Baskin Robin's blue raspberry sherbet is an absolute lie!
I can’t believe that matpat’s favorite flavor of snowcone is pansexuality
Oftentimes the flavor blue is one of my favorite candy flavors
THE INTROS BACK YESSS
Your life is theories
4:01 I’m sorry matpat but blueberries are purple
I always assumed Blue Raspberry was Blueberries and Raspberry
i always assumed its short for blueberries and raspberries, at least thats what my Faygos say.
Personal theory. Blue raspberry is what the flavor of nuka cola quantum  tastes like. Thus why it's so popular
The flavor is blue mat. BLUE.
But blueberries are purple there not blue mat pat
Feed the lore demon with otter pop lore
Mat should do a otter pop lore episode
I need a theory on what banana flavor is and why does it not taste like bananas at all
For otter pops you put 2 cosmic coconuts what’s the other otters flavour?
Food theory idea should school keep on serving chocolate milk
I was understood grape flavor to be more of like the wine grapes then table grapes
We been knew. This is why I’ve never liked it. It tastes the most like chemicals and metal. Also banana and grape flavoring are up there.
I personally tried to figure this out about a year ago, couldn't come up with anything worthwhile when researching. Thanks for the video MatPat & gang :)
But what about sour patch Strawberries and Sour patch Watermelon.
i just love editer dan
The M&M thing was actually portrayed in Stranger Things season 3 when Mike shares his M&Ms with Eleven
Indeed is blue
Maybe its called blue Raspberry because it tastes like raspberry and they made it blue because there are already  flavors like strawberry and watermelon I don't think there's many flavors that are colored blue
Ok sooo… is no one else gonna point out the fact that matpats snow cone has the colors of the pan flag? No? Ok.
Matpat you'r life is... L O R E
I don't know about anyone else but I have always known since the first time I've ever heard about it that blue raspberry isn't real 😂 Like duh, come on.
Everyone's favorite flavor that doesn't exist
My favorite flavour is caboose blue
You would think after attempting to get the worst brain freeze in the brain freeze episode Matpat would be avoiding cold stuff still lol
He got the twitter blue flavor
You say blueberries but Blueberries are purple
I was expecting a visit from our old friend, Castoreum.
I was eating a blue popsicle when this came out
Blue
Yeah mat pat givng the most obvious takes.
Any thoughts on the idea that an aversion to artificial grape/cherry is tied to which flavored cough syrup spoiled it. IE I have had friends that hate cherry flavor but love cherries while I hate grape flavor but can munch grapes like no other. Found out they were a Robotussin cherry house while I was a Dimatap grape home
Yet blue Fernandes tastes the worst.
Nah that bit was the truth. You call it by color, never the flavor name
i'm wheezing i don't usually watch the opening skits but that whole "what did you get?" "Blue." cracked me up!
Blue
blue Is the taste of blueberry or On Swedish blåbär!  Did you know blueberries are consumed by pilots in the past to get better sight or better focus when flying Longer time in bad weather.
imma tell y’all i try blue raspberry the person that was making it add to much now my poop is blue send help
HAHA FINALLY SOMETHING I KNEW BEFORE MATPAT SAID IT
I'm from Canada, where we have tutti-frutti and blue raspberry, and the tutti-futti is colored pinkish. Usually it's a pink/orange striped affair. Not bright pink or orange, softer almost pastel. And it has a VERY district smell/taste from blue raspberry items. Keeping in mind that almost all taste is smell, and that scent molecules, even of the same name can smell different whether they are "forwards" or "backwards", so it's possible they are the same mixture of molecules in different formations, but there would be no mix up if you handed them to people to taste. They taste very different. But the cough syrup thing people have commented, both does and doesn't make sense. In Japan I have heard their medicine tastes like Root Beer so they don't usually have root beer candies. But in North America we have grape cough syrup, have had it for ages. Heck our most famous medicine is that banana flavored one for kids and that flavor is still hugely popular in candies. So maybe the medicine flavor similarities are not impacting things the way you guys think.
Blue is definitely a flavor
Mat. Why don't they make peach soda all over the country? That fake peach flavor would sell like crazy, but I just can't find it outside of novelty stores.
Dan giving me caboose flash backs
I always assumed it was to differentiate it from strawberry and/or have it be a mix of raspberry and blueberry.
Blue 🔵
Ahem. BLUE BERRIES ARE F**CKING PURPLE
i’m confused, has no one ever heard of a blackberry? blue raspberry is a think just dark blue
Otterpop Episode When?
I don’t care what you say about my favorite flavor, it hits different and is it’s own flavor
Haven’t watched yet, but I’ve ALWAYS theorized this. It’s a generic sweet with a popular color, so people’s brains just shortcut to choose it.
So style therohri is not blue
blue raspberry taste like tomatoes
I, mean I knew it was artificial but i didn't know what was in it, so good to know.
u have great editing
i still remember watching that first video. so much more high quality now, but WOW.
What the heck… literally two days ago I was trying to find a way to suggest this channel does a video about this! Realized I couldn’t send it, but now a small part of me is wondering if MatPat has a recording device in my house…
Otter pops lore,
Honestly I still find the fact that we have synthetic fruits amazing. I associate two VERY different flavors with all fruits (except blueberry because blue raspberry decided it would be the dominant blue fruit flavor EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN’T EVEN EXIST)!
I want an otter pop theory
I will say the blue bubblegum snowballs you get in Louisiana taste better than the clear or pink ones you sometimes find. There's just something about blue...
blueberries are freaking purple
Blue is a valid flavor
Somebody should actually breed blue raspberry flavored blue raspberry.
blue :)
Blue is my favorite flavor of literally everything :)
Wait do people actually think blue raspberry exists?
Blue raspberry is the best.
Do blue vanilla next
Hey I like grape to,even though it's nothing like real 🍇.
When I was younger I alwayse wondered why there was no blue raspberry skittle, because everything else had blue raspberry flavors, so I would alwayse imagine me going to skittles® HQ and holding the inventor of skiddles hostage and force him to eat M'Ms (his rival candy) until he makes blue raspberry a flavor. I was a wierd kid
Blue raspberry flavor is a mixture of blueberry’s and raspberry’s or blackberry’s
Grape is the worst artificial flavor you can’t change my mind
I would love for him to do a video on what exactly makes up the flavor of "birthday cake"
Sorry Matt, you're wrong. Blueberries are purple
1:30 Scientists believe Violet is the rarest colour in nature, not blue
Grape flavoring does taste like grapes, it just tastes like concord grapes, just like banana flavoring tastes like Big Mike bananas
Man.. my little bro and I were talking about this before like “blue raspberry is just raspberry flavor, they just put the word Blue in front of it”
the part where head editor dan said "it bluing time" was so emotional and heartwarming
grape flavoured things are mimicing the flavour of Concord grapes like in jellies not table grapes that you buy at the store most often
Did MatPat just say “It’s kinda sending me right now”
I am groote.
Blue😂
Blue
One snaps the Otter pop over the knee! Scissors were never a requirement.
WE NEED OTTER-POP LORE.
4:32 I lost it... that was uncalled for! 🤣
Blue pigment in nature isn’t real though. The structure of the skin refracts light in such a way to appear blue
Yaasss!!! Otter pop loooore, do it!!!!!
It is Blue Blue  berry
We need a blue asmr
So when is the otter pop lore video coming
That intro was HILARIOUS!! 🤣🤣🤣
that is some odd MMPR comic
I already knew it was fake
You wanna talk flavors that don't make sense? Coca Cola Transformation Flavor...what in the hey-hey does that even MEAN!? We went from Coca Cola Starlight, to Coca Cola Dreamworld...to...this...? Coke really loves their abstract concepts as flavors, don't they? :/
With the whole grape not tasting like grape need I point out any fruit doesn’t taste like it’s artificial coloring, especially banana, grape, and cherry!
Since the first time I thought "what is bluerazzberry?" I assumed the only answer it could be was blueberry+razzberry flavors combined. Wasn't until I was about 20 that I realized Noone else thought so
it's kinda funny, I specifically started trying to germinate whitebark raspberry seeds a week ago to compare the flavors.
Wow
"What's your Sno-cone flavor?"  "BLUE"  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm Dutch and have never heard of blue raspberry flavor
I am currently drinking a blue raspberry Ghost
so i'm eating jolly ranchers right...
Blue raspberry is a a fake fruit I know but thank you for telling everyone
I think this one's pretty easy. When you have strawberry cherry and raspberry as an option. You kind of run out of colors.
DAN: "Blue." MATPAT: *Going insane in the background*
Amouranth.
A good 13 minutes
EXUSE ME MATPAT! BLUE RASBERRY IS BASED ON A REAL BERRY NAMED WHITEBARK RASBERRY!
Lemon/Orange/Lime are by far the best flavors
there used to be a blueberry flavor :(
📘♂️🔹️🥶🔷️🔵💙🐳🌠🐟💠🐦
And after watching this vid, literally appeared a Markiplier Sour Patch vid in the suggested. This exact vid: https://youtu.be/nUQvSsC0ij0
I never call pretty much anything by its flavor in favor of referring to them by color, like gatorade.
I knew raspberries weren't blue, I eat raspberries
the intro made me laugh lol. just- "blue." lol btw blueberries are purple dispite the fact being called BLUE berries
{{ BLUE FLAVOR :3 BULE FLAVOR :3 }} . [ Tue 5:52pm 4/25/2023 ]
Please do one on bubblegum. What is bubblegum please I chew it all the time. You are the only one I trust
rasberrys are dark blue
12:40 Grape absolutely tastes like grapes. Not like standard table grapes, but exactly like Concord grapes. A large, very purple grape not often seen because it has a thick skin and large seeds.
The cool blue Gatorade taste like Oranges
Rubus leucodermis (the "blue raspberry" or "whitebark raspberry"), a species of Rubus native to western North America. Blue raspberry flavor, a food and beverage flavoring, often artificially colored blue.
I just noticed that I'm eating a blue raspberry sluchy💀💀💀
We must have the otter pop lore video
Let old Uncle Tony teach you kids something about Otterpops and Fla-vor-Ice pops. Bend them in the middle when frozen and they will snap into two pieces. Enjoy!
Grape flavored stuff doesn’t taste like grapes, it taste like purple and I will not elaborate
Blue raspberry is just raspberry flavoring with blue dye. Summed up the whole video and didn't need 13 minutes to say it.
6:55 "what even is my life at this point?" and then I got an ad that said "peanuts. caramel. chocolate."  That's nuts! A funny coincidence in a nutshell! That would be a sticky situation..  No? Not funny? I will take my leave now..
blue tastes of peppermint or Smurfs.   There's no other option.
It may be fake, but it is still the best candy flavor
Ladies and gentlemen, we have witnessed the world's first existential crisis induced by Otter Pop.
Rubus leucodermis (the "blue raspberry" or "whitebark raspberry"), a species of Rubus native to western North America. Blue raspberry flavor, a food and beverage flavoring, often artificially colored blue.
Head editor Dan becoming a Happy Happyist
I've always thought blue raspberry was something synthetic because raspberries are red but always wondered what blue raspberry flavor actually is, so I appreciate this video. Also grape jolly ranchers taste like grape medicine.
pansexual snow cone!!!
He got blue
Otter Pop lore....and i just heard in my head when MatPat said this was "the LLLLOOOOORRRRRREEEEEEE" lol
Many of us are familiar with red, purple and even yellow raspberries, but what is a blue raspberry? The blue raspberry originated in a laboratory, not on a farm.
I have said for years that blue raspberry is completely fake and just a marketing trick
When I was a kid I asked EVERYONE what their favorite color was and everyone said blue and id say that everyone’s favorite color and that person would get mad at me saying no it wasn’t. 😂😂😂
I was watching you at my hospital bed and my doctor heard "FOOOOOOOOd theory" I think she was confused
I knew that.
I though blue otter pops are cotton candy flavor
Thanks for the vids Mattpat
I remember hearing that we have blue raspberry because red was associated for strawberry and cherry already (could be wrong) and strawberry could be pink
Otter pop lore would be amazing
this videos is getting exactly 106k views an a hour :o noice!
You broke my dreams, hopes, willing to live, and sanity by this line  "Blue raspberries do not exist"   I swear I looked at the video and paused walking around my room and hyperventilating
Non Americans looking at MattPatt taking about American sweets be like 😐
Artificial Grape flavor is Methyl anthranilate, which, isn't artificial, and is naturally occurring as the compound responsible for the flavor and smell of  concord grapes. It's used as artificial grape flavoring, as well as bird repellant. Grape flavored candy tastes like grape concentrate.
I thought the blue was blueberry instead of blue raspberry.
What is the science behind frozen grapes?
Dang, just yesterday I was wondering what blue raspberry was. Nice video matpat! *ALSO PLEASE DO AN OTTER POP THEORY*
There was a guy at my local farmers market selling what he called blue raspberries. He said it was a cross between a blackberry and raspberries. It was a bluish, purplish, raspberry looking fruit.
As someone who always thought Grape and cherry candies never really tasted like their real world counterparts, I’d be very interested in diving a bit deeper on this topic.
4:02 "BLUEBERRIES ARE FUCKING PURPLE!!!" -Randy Feltface
i just thought raspberry and blueberry in one 💀
The intro made me think of that one Chikin Nugitt video.
So, the final part of my childhood finally comes under attack...Of course it would be you Mat
Blue berry hahaha
Grape taste like purple
6:54 I got lore for, u film theory , a season of unfortunate events Netflix
Tbh that dragon flavored pudding or tapioca was good, but to be fair the green ones taste more like green apple and the red ones are somewhere between strawberries and cherries or cherries and raspberries, and personally I like the green ones more cuz I like green apple   Also all the ads I got whilst watching this were food related so I'm glad YouTube is atleast paying better attention than it usually does
Orange is sad cuz nothing rhymes with orange
Blackberry I do not f ING know why you call it blue raspberry tho     Edit: it's JOKE
I only am a smart*ss about the blue m&m because I am a theorist of 10 years... you raised this, its you're own doing 😅
The answer is yes…yes you do have to do an Otter lore breakdown now lol
Grape candy tastes like concord grapes. Banana candy tastes like the a breed of banana that went extinct over 50 years ago.
bro we already knew that blue raspberry is not real
Blueberry + raspberry
I don’t care, blue raspberry’s my favorite. It’s like slightly sour raspberry
Blu
I love everyone in the Theory team cause you are all fun
I've never heard of blue raspberries in my entire life TBH.
Dan saying 'Blue' has same energy as Gura saying 'Bag'
Blue.
🍇Who else is team grape?🍇  👇
I thought Dan had to leave the Theorist Channels or was this recorded be for Dan left?
I agree with Dan that the flavour is "blue". Nothing other than blue tastes like blue you know?
LMAO " I'M BLUE DA BU DE DA YOU D!E" LOL
Up until I was ten i'm eleven now, I would never get the blue raspberry flavor because there's no such thing as a blue raspberry.
Yup Dan got the best flavor
Top 10 theory channels intro skits, i just love this introduction
Soul Knight lore
You know you watch to many matpat theories when you guess the flag joke 😂
The flavor is highlighter
I thought matpat was gonna attack him for a second 0:38
Bbbbbbllllllluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuueeeeeeeeeee
Dan is like Batman to Mattpat’s Superman. Always shoving his weakness in his face and driving Mattpat crazy. Dan even has the flat/blunt voice down. “Blue.”
Blue raspberry is the superior flavor  Said what I said
Blue
a very small channel did a video on this topic maybe around a month ago, kinda sad that person wont ever get as many views as this, even though theres a chance that video inspired this one
Blue raspberry is a mixture of blueberries and raspberry
6:57 someone has to say it, We passes 'THIS POINT'   a g e s   a g o
3:57 i seen the blue raspberry
I am pretty sure grape flavor does taste like grape, it's just not your average table grape or whatever you call it
I always thought blue raspberry was just a mix between Blueberry and raspberry. Maybe I’m wrong lol
It went from ruining your childhood games to ruining movies food and fashion lmao.
Living in Canada, I've never heard of"Otter Pops" before, but we do have an identical product called "Mr. Freeze".   And the blue flavor is BY FAR the best one.
Dan: "im blue daba di daba die"
I would personally say Blueberry Lemonade is probably the closest thing to what Blue Raspberry would be not to mention Blue Raspberry is artificially made so it’s common to see it spelt as Blue Razzberry because a Razzberry doesn’t technically exist (unless I’m experiencing a Mandela Effect)
I will make a blue raspberry and you will like it!
Blue raspberry is extremely overrated
PLEASE DO A OTTER-POP THERY
Really loving blue food? @PercyJackson that you?,
blue
Nobody actually thinks blue raspberry is real, why is this even a theory, this is just a fact.
Blue
Watch a couple of months later a company is going to be inspired by MatPat’s video and find away to create a blue raspberry. Because money.
We have blueberries flavour in Serbia but not bluerspbarry because it's the same and we ain't dumb enough to believe that bluerasbarry exist like 16.4 milion americans think that chocolate milk comes from brown cows
How is it that you know the experience of trying to open an otter pop with your teeth, yet you've never seen the characters on the box and tube?
Once had blue ice cream in Belgium, was kinda bubblegum flavour I think, best thing was the name though… Smurf Ice Cream
when the fake flavor is better then the real ones
i feel stupid now
I  just  got a  blue  raspberry  slushy
i love it when my favourite flavor is trash talked :D
For candy I usually go for Grape or Blue Raspberry.
I am having flash backs of Percy Jackson’s mom if you get that joke you have probably read all the books
"What's the flavor of Blue?" Icy Charge.  Which I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like, but I'm pretty sure it moves me into melee and reduces my target's movement speed by 15%.
Cool blue taste like orange
I think a banana flavoring theory would be interesting. I feel like a lot of people don’t know about how the banana flavor in candy is actually based on a different variety of bananas the went “extinct”
M...matpat.... Matpat honey.... We Been Knew.
i dont care if its a lie, blue razz is the best
I thought blue raspberry was just sour raspberry.
I always figured it was “blue” flavored and that “blue” was the taste of “chemicals that actively burn my throat”
3:24 blueberry
blueberries are purple
I'd really like to see a full video on how people used to think that red #2 dye caused cancer, if that proved true or not, and if it isn't true, why I still have people tell me that all the time
4:05 As a wise purple Australian puppet once said, "BLUEBERRIES ARE F*CKING PURPLE!"
I'm blue. Does this mean I'm also poisonous?
IS TI A SCAM
blue caraco is actualy orange flavour liquer, quite nice in a small glass of wine and pinaple juice
Blue used to be the color of pineapple flavoring in Snow cones (Shaved ice) when I grew up.
Did... people really think there were blue raspberries?
It would have been so funny if started singing I am blue dabadi
Shane said it first !!
" these flavors are rediculous" < "HNNNGGGG LICKKKINNNGG ARRIIEELLLLL"
Blue.
The beginning kinda reminds of the that one chikn nugget skit with chee and sody pop
Im always wondered about this thanks
No, it can't be! Blue Raspberry was LYING!? But we went to school together! What a betrayal!
Malic Acid + picture of a lemon 🤦🏻‍♀️  Instead of an apple, for which malic acid gets its name
Pls do a theory on welcome home!
Lol blue stop sign
WE NEED OTTER POP LORE!!!
Blue is best flavor. Anyone telling you otherwise is a flavor fascist.
Anyone else notice that MatPat’s snow cone in the beginning is the Pansexual pride flag? Could be a coincidence but it’s just something I noticed.
"Amaranth causes cancer."  Best part of this video
I still think that blue raspberry tastes like a sweetened mix of blueberries and raspberries
I was always told that purple was the rarest naturally occurring color. And thats why it's associated with royalty and magic!  I was also taught that blue raspberry is just "sour raspberry".
What about red 40?
Its just blue lol
I would love another theory (or mini theory!) on this subject! Like why other flavors taste weird compared to their real-life counterparts, or why Blue #2 is considered the safest food dye, if natural blue things are very often toxic-- what is blue #2 derived from?
3:17 Me: *points out the m&m not having a “blue” flavor* MatPat: 3:19  Me: 😡
Banana flavor doesn't taste like bananas
The whole time i just kept thinking about how raspberry commonly has a flavor now tho 😅 and blue raspberry is now just its own thing i dont think ive ever thought thats what raspberry was supposed to tast like 😅
Otter pop lore? Yes, please!
Yo mat dat otter pop theory sounds fun, The Secret Lore of Otter Pops
What about purple
Percy Jackson has entered the chat
It may not be a real flavor but it's still the best
Could u do a similar video like this with pink lemonade
We have pink/purple raspberry candy here in Finland. Blue/deep purple are often blueberry or blackcurrant flavor here!
idc what you tell me im still drinking blue raspberry drinks i love the "fake" flavour
gatorade theory: cool blue isn't blue raspberry hypothesis: they have blue cherry so having blue raspberry feels like weird marketting conclusion: i dont know what cool blue tastes like
Only watching this cuz I got a blue raspberry vape lol
Now that we Now what blue is, figure out what the heck Blu is.
1:24 a color doesn’t need to be a pigment to be a color
I literally watched this while eating a blue raspberry Jolly Rancher. 💀💀
Apparently “grape” flavour comes from one specific type of grape, the Concord grape. So if you get yourself the Concord grape it tastes like the “grape” flavour
Yes, Mat. You indeed need to do an Otter-pop lore video.
Bluuuuuuuuue
*u tellin me ppl thought blue raspberry was for real?*
grape tastes like concord grape. THE grape. The king of grapes.
You reading this right now, currently has a chance of 2.8K to 1 so you might as well like to save ur spot. 👇
Honestly, all of the artificial candy fruit flavors don't taste at all like their actual fruit.
YEAH! AN EPISODE WITH THE OPENING! That's how you know it's gonna be good!
Same, I love the flavor of grapes in candy and other stuff
My friends make fun of me for liking grape flavoring
check Lucky charms do you not know they’re poisonous
Blueberries are purple 😑 That's the color of the juice when you crush the skins
Blue
Percy Jackson watching this video:  "HOW IS BLUE NOT A FLAVOR, ANNABETH GIVE ME THE SWORD!!!"
I challenge you to make a blueberry smoothie and tell me it's not purple.
Blue raspberry was my favorite artificial flavor at one point
To quote Randy Feltface, "BLUEBERRIES ARE ****ING PURPLE!"
Literally this summer I ate some blue raspberry from a bush here in Italy, i don't get why you say it doesn't exist
BEST! INTRO! IN! HISTORY!
I find his rage at the blue raspberry to be very funny 😂
In France during the 90's, we all knew anything blue was Mint. We use both green and blue to represent mint in shaved ice and other cool drinks. Blue meant icy cold mint, basically.
Queries?
Wait there’s a raspberry jolly rancher? Sign me up!
American grape flavor tastes like how Play-Doh smells
Licking Ariel 😂
6:15 you open it by snapping it in half
The grape flavor that’s used in sodas and candy is a specific species from Japan which is very fragrant, which gives it the flavor. The grapes we eat are different than the flavor used.
Him saying groote 💀
Oke THIS WHAS MY FAFORIT OPENING OF THIS CHANEL EFFER
I don't even have to ask, I know we are getting an *OTTER POP LORE* video
Now you have to do an Otter Pop lore video.
What flavor is it? It's blue (dabudee dabudai)
So much talk about nonsensical flavours and this man just skips over bubblegum like that's a flavour
I love the flavor blue and the color raspberry
1:43  I dunno what I was expecting after an exhausting day and an afternoon shift, but it definetely wasn't this.  I think I know what I'll be hearing the whole night now Also I just bought Blue Raspberry Gummies so this was really interesting timing.
It's funny because I just barely bought some blue raspberry sour punch straws
So you agree blue is blue flavored. I'm a grape guy myself too (I love a straight up grape soda) but I say the flavor is purple. Most fruit flavored things suffer from this but I think grape is 100% purple never grape.
fruits are amazing and fruit flavor candies are always the best flavors even if they arent real like blue raspberries
Sub to food theory or else Dan will “blue” you to death
Praise God
4:32  The power.... Its in my fingers....
I always knew Amouranth was poisonous
B L U E
i love the blue raspberry flavor so much
Blue tastes kinda pointy
1:35 >Talks about things that actually have blue pigment >Shows the most famous example of something that's blue but doesn't have ue pigment  Also, you can't say the sky 'isn't actually blue,' color is just a human construct, so if something looks blue then it is blue.
Blue
Blueberries aren't blue
Only because you said 'Dont'. =)
I had been talking with my mom just the other day that blue is its own flavor beyond blue raspberry, with blue raspberry just being a part of the flavor.  So if you ask me, I agree with Dan. Blue. Just blue.   Also, otter pop lore theory yes please!
Was thinking about this today
What is that intro tho
Good video 😊
Blue is my favorite flavor
As sans Undertale once said: remember blue stop signs
New idea: What is pink lemonade
I'm today's years old where I found out "blue raspberry" isnt just weird western's slang/synonyms for blueberry.
I don't care what mashup of flavors blue raspberry really is, I still go nuts for it
6:55 yes yes you do
Blueberry?  Yes, it has purple overtones, but it's BLUE!
Percy Jackson would be so happy to know blue-colored foods are so popular!
Blue has the most anti oxygens
i feel like I'm a genius because i found this out before this video
Green haribo bears are actually strawberry flavor
BLUE
I got an ad for sour patch kids on this video lol
do dredge lore!! (the game)
cook your rasberry
There's this one mexican candy that's in the shape of corn. It's not corn flavored tho lol. If you look at the label, it says it's strawberry flavored. Can't say it tastes like strawberry tho 🤔🤔
For the record, I've had grapes that tasted almost exactly like artificial grape flavour. They were green grapes someone was growing in their backyard.
Blue is the best flavor of m&m’s fight me
bro can you do something about murder drones, the solver and the singularity are WAY too good for you to pass up. also its on youtube for free
BLUE
This is so weird I was just thinking about this question yesterday
Everything about the otter pops ring so true. Took me back to summer camp as a little kid
Technically it IS raspberry is one of the ingredients comes from raspberries
Yes. omg yes. Make an otter-pop lore episode.
Otter-Pop Lore theory please
Blue Hater.
4:04 MatPat: “blueberries are blue” Randy Feltface: “BLUEBERRIES ARE F###ING PURPLE!!!”
Lol licking Ariel
It really be blue da ba dee da ba die
Green is my favourite Flavour
No joke, I was eating a magic shell ice cream bar while watching this video! 😂
Freezies.
4:10 ...well there is the fictional pudding, also an angry Disney princess.
Che: “What flavor do you want?” Soady pop: “blue flavor!” Che: “uhhh, you mean blue raspberry?” Soady pop: “Blue Flavor! Blue Flavor!” Che: “Blue is not a flavor!” Soady pop: “BLUE FLAVOR!!!”
6:00 Already looking forward to the Otter pop lore video.
I had a teacher my senior year of high school who refused to eat anything that was blue. No matter who small or harmless. Not even something like sprinkles. (And blue berries didnt count because they are purple).
blue.
Dan saying “blue” is the best
My favorite flavor was a lie
My friend bought a drink that was in a jug, the label just said blue flavored drink and we were joking that it looked like antifreeze
What about color blind people? They might have eaten raspberries that appeared blue to them...
Blackberries exists.
I knew about this before you decided to make a video about it!
Um I’m blue purple colorblind, that means that I see blue and purple as the same color so when you see blue I see purple and when you see purple I see purple
skip first 5 mins to get to the video you clicked for
To me, Blue Raspberry will always be blue, and grape will always be purple ❤
If he doesn't do an otter pops theory I am suing
Sorry, but Grape tastes like Grape.
There's a lot of animals that actually aren't blue but make you think that they are. Specifically one I know of is butterflies, it's a fun thing to watch/read about. And all I think of when it comes to blue food is George Carlin. Blueberries aren't blue! They're purple. Don't let big berry lie to you
blue
The banana flavor we know in candies is actually based off a Cavendish banana we no longer eat because it essentially went extinct due to lack of genetic diversity.
Blueberries are purple
blue?...             BLUE!!!
Are you going to reprise your role as phone guy in the random encounters FNAF musical
I always thought blue raspberry was just a special artificial raspberry flavor
Please do an otter pop lore video!
BLUE.
The snozberries taste like snozberries.
blue flavor my favorite
And that is why I eat real fruit .
Chad Dan: Blue BetaPat: *shrieks in agony*
I'm blue (dabadee, dabadaa)
when he mentioned blow pop i legit had one in my mouth rn 0_0 and it was the same flavor
In Hungary we have a type of blackberry that can have a blue color. It's name roughly translates to ashy blackberry. It has a layer of ash like substance on its surface not unlike plums that gives it its blue hue. It's Latin name is rubus caesius if you want to look it up. It grows near where I live and I used to think that is where the flavour came from when I was a kid but now it is quite obvious that it isn't made from a real fruit.
Honestly I think blue rasberry is one of my favorites specifically because it's blue. Pretty sure my brain's been gaslighting me into thinking it's different lol
Cool Blue Gatorade tastes like oranges, or lemons, or grapefruit, or tangerines, or clementines, or any other citrus. Citric acid may be the ingredient it has the least of, but it's very noticeable.
ive always said "grape" flavor tastes like purple instead of grapes
MatPat should do a video evaluating the distance from a nuclear explosion where store bought frozen pizzas are perfectly cooked
I always thought blue raspberry was a flavour that was made up so red could be strawberry but companies could still use blue for something (edit I had NOT seen most of the video before this)
It’s got antioxygens
2:40 i would love Purple m&n's and do love purple gaderade I LOVE PURPLE. AND LOVE LEMANAND AND PINK LEMAND inst lemonad it is strabeyand 12:30 I LOVE GRAPE TOO I REARLY have  prosed stuff most of them has soy can you do a theroy and out what the best soy replacement and what dairy free cheese is the best that should be a video whare you and Steph? have a tast test and a blind taste test at the end plz that will help my mom and dad's cooking be cuz amost all the food that i have been eating has soy
blue on its own is a flavour tho like you can't explain it other then it tasting blue
SOUR PATCH KINDER! °o°/  | | Sour.Sweet.Gone.
Blue
Blue taste like blue
It would be interesting to explore why American grape and Japanese grape flavors are so different. I enjoy both, but the grape flavor in Japanese candies is so much better. Why is this Matpat???
Blue.
Blue
I love you're videos
Someone is going to watch this and selectively breeding raspberries and make them blue
MatPat: What flavour did you get? Dan: Blue MatPat: What flavour did you get !?! Dan: #0000FF
coolblue is also a company
To be fair, blue raspberry and grape do just taste like what you'd expect the colours blue and purple to taste like. Also, blueberries are fucking purple.
BLUE BERRIES ARE PURPLE!!!!!!!!! NOT BLUE!!!!
Fun fact some freeze pops can be snapped in half to open them when frozen solid of course
I wouldn't call this a theory, this is just a fact, a well-known one too
Blue flavor is Pepsi Blue flavor
To quote a genius, "BLUEBERRIES ARE F***ING PURPLE!!"
It’s blue flavor. It’s always been blue flavor. It will always be blue flavor.
Mats spittin facts. 6:07
9:39 behind necola tesla
Just starting the video. Will try to have blue raspberry later today. ...and maybe some blueberries.
I eat/drink way to much stuff labeled as blue raspberry
You leave my fantasy flavors alone i love the new unicorn stuff coming out
THIS IS SO RELATABLE OMG THIS INCLUDES BLUE JOLLY RANCHERS LOL😂😂😂
Man you gotta get that BLUE FLAVOR
Or that banana doesn’t taste like banana
blue
Blueberry’s are purple
Matpat ruining my child hood
Blue
2:08 *insert my brain playing 'i'm blue' 7,000 times*  Srsly though, thank you matpat. I always thought that blue raspberry was so weird, so i'm glad it was justified
I've never qwuestioned it as every iteration of blue rasberry I have tried has tasted to me like a rasberry, but if it was blue
Funniest joke
Blue Razz was often Raspberry and Lime in its origins. a more acidic citrussy note on a berry flavonoid
For summer I worked at a snow cone place and despite having the most extravagant and detailed names and flavors it never failed for grown adults to ask for blue. Also, we had both blue and red raspberry, there wasn’t much difference at all except blue was a little more sour Edit: I should also say that blue raspberry was our most popular flavor, we’d go through about a gallon a day
Yo chill out with that Mermaid talk man
So I know this is about "blue raspberry" but how about watermelon flavored things such as watermelon sour patch kids those a 10/10 for me.
Hi
Voting yes for Otter Pops lore video, even though this is the first time I've heard of the brand.
Meh, none of the artificial flavors actually taste like their respective fruit anyway. Even when they use actual fruit juice, it is just not the same. That is why, I like to treat each flavor as their own unique thing, and the naming after whatever is just that.
I thought MatPat gave up his Diet Coke addiction.
Bluuuuuuuuuuue
Just have to add, Edison wasn't actually the best inventor, but a hack who claimed everyone else's ideas as his own using money and threats.
Yesss! The intro is back!!!
Blueberry
The intro had me laughing for a few minutes :)    BLUE
w dan
Maybe do a video on why american flavors to candies are so much weirder compared to flavors in europe or even in asia.
its grape mixed with raspberry.
It's great that we now know the flavor of blue raspberry, but what is the flavor of Swedish fish???
Did Nobody proofread the licking aerial line……just saying 😅😂
And Thomas Edison isn't an inventor. He didn't invent anything. He was a patent troll.
blue raspberry is the worst flavor, now I find out it never existed lol
Me trying not to make a Blue Stop Sign joke/reference:
the flavor of *blue*
Yeah, I bought some "old fashioned" raspberry hard candies with raspberry filling. Absolutely no where on the ingredients list. Just malic acid and sugar and apple juice and solids
grape flavor DOES taste almost EXACTLY  like concord grapes.
Please do an otter pop lore theory!
I was just eating blue raspberry, sour patch kids when this video came up😢
Wow, Blue raspberry is fake????? I never knew they were fake, I mean blue food only does not really exists in nature. WTF MatPat????? really grasping at straws here
So your telling me if I made a raspberry into the shape of a sour patch kid dye it with blue n2 and pour Suger on it I would have a sour patch
Calling blue 'raspberry' has ALWAYS pissed me off. I specifically went out of my way to shun it as a kid.
When Matpat said' there are perfectly good berries out there that are actually blue', the clip of Rand Feltface yelling 'Blueberries are F-ing Purple' played in my head.
never seen or heard of blue raspberry anything in my life
is this a weird mandela effect or did you already upload this before
Do a food theory on the 5 second rule!!
I will make the argument that grape flavor doesn't taste like grape because grape flavoring makes me feel sick and has made me throw up
Dude why was that description of otterpops so dang accurate
But what about blue strawberries... or blue apples....?
I am kinda shocked about this
grape flavoring actually does taste like grapes just not the grapes Americans are used to eating. The grape flavoring in things actually taste like concord grapes because American grapes (Vitis labrusca) don't have much flavor to them, while concord grapes have a lot of flavor to them.
I think blue raspberry is an American thing...
Anybody else hearing a certain puppet screaming "BLUEBERRIES ARE FREAKING PURPLE!!!" Whilst watching this video?
When I was younger I would just say blue as well
*GaSp!!!*
I bet this "salty" (food pun) channel does not pin random comments
You guys should do critical race theory as your next channel The Critical race theorists  On a serious note some sort of social studies theory Channel would be awesome great video
I don't care I will still get blue😂
omg are the intros back????
Head Editor Dan has to be my favorite of all of the theorist team.   Blue.
Blue berry's
bruh your tchintchong raspberry is called mûre
Think it's time to start theorizing for the Otter Pop lore videos MatPat
Please, dear Theory deities, bless us with an Otter Pops Lore episode!!!
I only know, when I eat too much of it, I get a stomach ache and my poop is green.
I love berries, my favorite are bananas.
i always thought blue raspberry was blueberry and raspberry. yall remember blaspberries? tastes almost exactly like blue raz
But... Cool Blue Gatorade isnt even blue raspberry flavoured... it tastes like oranges....
Watermelon candy is generally magenta not pink.
https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxPvWP2k6H0leSp4aGHwjtyntoPsf57uAo
MatPat: There are no blue raspberries. MatPat in the same video: there ARE blue raspberries, and here's the scientific name.     Seriously mate, at least try to word it so you're not contradicting yourself. Blue raspberries do exist, they're just not what people mean when they talk about the artificial flavor.     Also, blue Gatorade has no connection to this at all. It doesn't even have rasp or berry in it's name. It's just the name of a product, like the unicorn and mermaid flavors mentioned in this same video. Gatorade Riptide Rush exists, but no one says "it's too sweet to taste a riptide" because that would just be water
I was eating blue raspberry sour patch kids while watching😶😶😶😶
I'd watch a video about Lil Orphan Oranges true parentage
https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxPjUYk0LZnpLyo8nONOhws7CkS_mTrmFE
Is it just me or is Matt pissed?
I got the notification while im eating a blue rasberry jolly rancher
You're doing the lord's good work out here MatPat, please give us the otter pops lore video
Yes doit otter pops !!!!!
Mine's cherries and I don't like Sour Patch Kids
As someone who has been a blue razz junkie for life and has known that blue razz isn’t a real/natural flavor since age 9, this video existing is hilarious to me
My Daughter (28 years old) has refused to eat or drink blue foods for as long as I can remember. Maybe she was onto something... 🤔🤷‍♀️
blue is my favorite flavor
Purple isn't typically grape outside the US, it's blackcurrant. Blackcurrants use to be illegal federally (the law was revoked in 1962), but by then purple=grape in the USA.
Blue
Matt saying “blue isn’t a flavor” is more controversial than all his FNAF theories put together
Why’s Anita fruit punch blue 6:47
Can you do a theory on wot makes bubble-gum so stretchy
Dragon fruit.
I feel like everyone knew this.
otter pop lore !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Love your content keep up the great work
I already knew that
Da boo de da boo dye🎵
I need a blue raspberry icee now
Man, I was so pissed as a kid when I found out blue raspberries weren't real
Didn’t everyone already know blue raspberry was an artificial flavour?
Finally an awnser
1:37 seconds in and the word blue has already lost all meaning 😂
Now that I think about it, what in the world is blue raspberry?
I'M RACIST HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA           just kidding this was an impulse comment
Gotta say matpats instant call out of me for the blue m&ms got me spooked.
I’m a grape guy as well mat keep up the great work
I have never heard of blue raspberry
I've always compared it mostly to like.. an amalgamation of fruits to define the flavor. I think the dye gives it the blue taste.
🔵
I always thought blue was supposed to be blueberries.
You only made me want to even more
"It's not blue it's just the way light reflects off it, there are actually very few real Blue things in the world" Isn't that just what color is? I'm confused.
We demand Otter Pop LORE THEORY!!!
I would LOVE matt diving into other fake flavours, like grape, cherry, banana, and really all other kinds
Wait you're telling me that people actually thought that "Blue Raspberry" was a fruit? Surely it would be obvious that it's just raspberry with blue colouring so you can tell it apart from strawberry?
3:18 on the left sour.
im blue da bo dee da buu DIE
finally!!! i was saying the same thing for centuries
Licking Ariel is crazy😂
I haven't had blue raspberry flavored anything for a long time now, i have now idea what it's supposed to taste like and that final description just confused me even more 😅
Of COURSE blue raspberry is a lie. They just make the raspberry flavoured products blue because raspberries are red and another common flavour is strawberry. Least, that’s my theory.
Petition for MatPat to uncover the lore of Otter Pops!
I thought blue-rasperry was blueberry plus raspberry flavorings lol
I wonder what color in nature has the most amount of eatable foods what color has the most amount of poisoned foods
I would like to see a video about artificial watermelon flavor (EX. Jolly Ranchers Watermelon). Everyone recognizes it instantly, but everyone also completely agrees that it doesn't taste anything like watermelon.
This reminds me of Xbox green
I'm surprised they haven't covered this one before. I just assumed I had originally learned about this fact from this channel!
I don't say blue I say blueberry cause blueberry are actually blue
Our blue raspberry is good, but not as good as brown. That classic ice cream flavor brown.
BLLUUUUuuuuuue!
hey matpat this roblox game called edward the man eating train just got some lore i want a theory but you dont have to
Just to say, some idiot from the Batchelor did not make Blue cocktails popular. Blue in cocktails has been a staple for years, blue lagoon or the use of Blue Curaçao has been going for years, including blue raspberry vodka etc. blue Slush puppies have been around since I was a kid, some 25 years ago along with Powerade. . Anyway great ep, but just annoyed about some bellend thinking she’s started a trend.
I KNEW IT
Scientists are always experimenting with agriculture and breeding plants how come no one has ever tried to create real raspberries
Blue
Fun fact: james Cameron picked blue as the color of the navi because it occurs so little in nature. He really wanted the navi to seem alien and to stand out among other fictional creatures
Bro I’m eating a blue raspberry ring pop right now
It's funny because my favorite flavor of Alani is Breeze Berry, which is obviously blue
Idc what anyone says, “ Blue” is the best flavor”
blue raspberry is blueberry + strawberry, not its own fruit everyone knows this what else could this be about
BWUE FAVOWRRRRRRRRR
The fact that such a revolutionary man like Melvin De Groote is second to a fake, excuse, for an inventor is sad.
Did I always know it was a fake flavor? Yes. Will that stop me from buying everything blue raspberry because it's my favorite flavor? Absolutely not.
Well, if I eat one blue raspberry, then another one I've just confirmed that the first one tasted like blue raspberry
I thought he sold the channel
Blue
Why have I never noticed that it wasn't a real flavor.
i actually don’t like blue raspberry.. i think it's gross
Me * sipping a Blue Raspberry Warhead soda* This video *pops up in my feed* Me "well,well,well...what do we have here?"
And i was just about to crack open my all blue sour patch kids. Perfect flavor for this episode
The best flavor.       blue
blue stop signs be like
Love the editor in this
Is this a video I'm too european to understand? (I'm kidding. I'm also american. which is why I'm not completely lost. I can also tell you that "blue raspberry" isn't a thing outside of anglo-north america)
In Spanish, growing up we called those products “mora azul” which is literally “blueberry” and everyone just assimilated with an artificial flavor of those over blue raspberries (since we just call all of these fruits moras=berries), and since everyone knew that artificial flavors are already different no one questioned it lol. It even felt odd to see blue raspberries in products like ICEE and such.
why did I never realize that blue raspberries aren't an actual thing?
Blue And Purple
You should also do one on why Banana doesn’t taste like banana! You can do a duo episode about why grape doesn’t taste like grape 😂
BLUE???
Has the same energy as gura and "bag"
7:33 wasberry
Grape flavored things taste like concord grapes. Not the more common green or red grapes.
you guys did not think for ONE sec to say hey is dis a real berry?
Hate to be the thorn in the comments but this episode was a wee bit too fast paced
But... Banana flavor
I was never a person for the flavor "blue," I'm more of a red flavor person, especially with jolly ranchers.
What about pink lemonade?
I thought This was obvious
I’m more of a prime guy
Im convinced every time he said "Amaranth" was edited in with the first take
When he said blue is a rare natural color it made me think of randy feltface saying "BLUEBARRIES ARE F*****G PURPLE" when someone said blueberries are blue
Today is my birthday 🥳
I love Otter pops (like all other things otter) and we want a LOOOOOOOOORRRRRREEEEEEE episode about them!!!  Please.
Dan wasn't referring to blue, he was referring to Blue
This is 100% my episode 💙
7:22 I remember a gummy bear that is green but it has strawberry flavor
My favorite sour patch kid flavor is lime.
blue is the correct answer.
Has he done video on banana flavour? The artificial banana flavour tastes nothing like real bananas, because that specific species of banana went extinct. The bananas we eat today are a different species of banana, with a different taste. Hence the difference in taste between real and artificial banana flavour.
blue raspberry is my favorite flavor of everything and it just occurred to me that I never seen one
I make candy gourmet gummies and raspberry extract doesn’t taste like blueberries if you just add blue food coloring you have to add some sort of acid and then the brain registers it as blueraspberry
I love Blue Raspberry South Patch Kids
I do the exact thing dan did at the start of the video.  someone asks, i say blue.
I feel like this past due
Blueberry’s are the flavor of blue. It’s a BLUE berry
The red chocolate is fake too.
Dan became a new pokemon "Blue"
i knew it!!! amaranth causes cancer
Mat loves Romania clearly
It taste like Blue. It’s not too hard.
a very good video actually.
theory idea, what, or why, is the flavour of barbeque?, id love to know
Blue.
Why did they even do this flavour?!
Blue da boo dee da boo Dai.
Blue.
They made blue raspberry to not be confused with flavors that are red like cherry, so that's why it exists.
I also love the blue ice-cream that doesn't taste like anything you know Its called Smurf ice or something blue-related Its yummy (comment written in the first few seconds)
banana tastes like bananas from many years ago. it tastes like bananas, not the ones we are used to eating though.
Blue Barry
i used to think blue rasberry was rasberry, lemon, and blueberry mixed
GREEN Haribo gummy bears are strawberry flavored and that is one of the biggest WTF moments I’ve ever had
BRO YESSS DO AN OTTERPOP LORE THEORY!!  I accidentally stumbled onto the lore and it's so fun to learn about xDD
Yeah it is
To be fair, strawberry flavor doesn't taste like atrawberry, it must be really hard to try to make a flavor so distinct and also so weird, If someone give me a strawberry with closed eyes, I could probably know I've had it before but not be sure on to what the f was that flavor but the smell is what would tell me that is a strawberry, the smell is what is all about
6:54 Please do an Otter Pop theory
Otter*pop lore? You made your bed now you lie in it.❤ I mean you did the Halloween episode.🎃
Technically, grape flavored things are meant to taste like Concord grapes, since table grapes kinda just taste like water-  On a more related note, I always kinda thought that blue raspberry flavoring was actually partially raspberry flavored, but also contained other flavors mixed into it
Im watching on two phones while writing this im about to go play games while watching
dawg its blue berry and rasberry and it makes blue rasberry
RISE MY GRAPE BRETHERIN! MATPAT IS ONE OF US!!!
Thank you for pointing this out!
Always had fresh raspberries readily available so blue raspberry to me was a fantastical equivalent to mermaid. Still one of my favorite flavors though, no matter how artificial >:3
Crazy how I actually knew what blue raspberry was even before this episode
In norway we have this thing called "bjørnebær" wich is a rasbery witch is blue
Sally Jackson disagrees.
Ok so basically I like blue raspberry because it's basically just cherry with some more sourness.
I thought blue raspberry was just blueberries and raspberry's?
yesss we need a otter pop lore video!
If grape flavor tasted like regular grapes it would be bland. That's why it's actually the flavor of *concord* grapes. Hank Green talked about that I think
im a materwelon guy
"We tend to associate blue with positive things: the sky, the ocean, Style Theory..." Nice plug there, Matt
because blueberry flavor sucks
I thought blue was depression
Mathew Patrick you never cease to amaze me my friend
MY WHOLE LIFE IS A LIE
You should do a video on Gimkit lore
i just want to gift matt a basket of gmo blue raspberries with the video link on a piece of paper just to cause a tiny bit of chaos.
Yay editor Dan
Am I the only one who thought blue raspberry was just blueberry and raspberry mixed together? Seems like the simplest explanation to me, Occam's razor and all that
Blue
You have to do an otter pop lore theory now that you brought it up.
From someone who's not from the US. I have never even heard of "Blue raspberry" . Just always assumed that blue things tasted like chemical blueberries 🤷‍♂️ Still a good episode though.
blue.
blueberrys are a thing the flaver blue can be them
Blu
And then gfuel instantly releases a blue raspberry mixed flavor dang
Imagine naming a colors flavor an imaginary fruit
To me, I never though blue raspberry was accurate. It was nice, but not exactly raspberry, especially not the domesticated kind. Blue raspberry, to me, tastes similar to wild raspberries, because yes, wild raspberries have been in my back yard before, and I used to eat them as a kid.
Id be interested in why grape doesn't taste like grape; its is my favorite flavor.  -Insert my childhood of children's grape Claritin-
My thoughts at I watched this went from “B L U E” to “Absolutely BLUE my mind!”
Weirdly my favorite flavoring orange, is apparently not very popular which I don't understand?
I never ate a sour patch kid...
Dan giving off some big Daria vibes in that intro...... and I don't hate it.
I just got Kona ice.
Honestly fashion therapy sucks
4:03 blueberries are f###### purple
My brain during this whole video: Yo listen up here’s a story…
I work at a vape shop where blue raz is such a common flavor & after 28 years it never crossed my mind that no, that flavor doesn’t exist until a customer pointed that out. 😂 this video is everything!
I NEED a video on otter pop lore
Thank you I've wondered this for years
Blueberrys are freaking purple
I like that Food Theory still has the intro
Im surprised there is not an animal theory seeing how four of his channels associates or mentions an animal once a while
Bro is trying to gaslight the internet with this “if you think you’ve eaten one, you haven’t!”
Otter pop Lore!!!
New intro?
grape is gross. it taste like PURPLE and i dye my hair purple often, you know what the dye smells like? ARTIFICAL GRAPE literal proof that fake grape is just purple
I KNEW you would make a video on this ever since you made Food Theory, I’ve craved answers and now I have them.
blue
What is bubblegum flavor?  I thought bubblegum tasted like nothing.
Personally I didn't care if it was 'raspberry' flavored. I love blue raspberry because it turns my tongue blue, and little kid me loved the idea of having a blue tongue 😋😂
i need a otter pop lore video by tomorrow matpat
Funny thing I got the suit color ad for GotG 3 and DEAR GOD I AM TRIGGERED
melvin de groote: "i am groote"
Blue
Blueberries?
Iz blu
Actually, I'm pretty sure that Grape flavorings do taste like real Grapes; It's just a specific type of Grape that's not commonly sold because other Grapes produce bigger harvests.
blueberry
Ok, I'm gonna just say this but the Gatorade Artic blue flavor (I think it is called) does make me think of mint when recalling the taste idea. And often got a chilly-feeling flavor or minty flavor to me. So I'll cross that one into exclusions with blue M&M
Blue
my favourite flavour is watermelon
Whether it’s a flavor or not I love it
I can see Dan just saying blue when asked about his foods flavor
Frisse
Grape flavor is supposed to taste like Concorde grapes, not table grapes like most people get at the supermarket
So the flavor is blue, right?
I'm confused. Are they keeping the intro or not? lol
You should sooooo do a otter pop theory
Blue raspberry is actually called blueberry if you didn't know
Please do otter pop lore. I think it would be real funny to watch.
I always assumed blue raspberry was blueberry + raspberry
Lemon flavor dominance
Well, that is one mystery of childhood solved succinctly.
1:34 isn’t it violet
MatPat: What does Blue taste like!?!  Me: *Drinking a Blue Slushy* Tangy
But why not blueberry?
Whenever I hear the word "blue" on its own like that, I just think of breaking bad because of this one tankfish video
Man think how FREAKING COOL it would be to have purpel or pink m&m's
Wonderful video, answer is at 11:39  in case you just want the answer
Grape theory 🎉
Bro, I need some Otter Pop lore
grape does taste like grape though, just the concord variety. It does taste slightly different bc that's how flavorings work but it's really just concord grapes
always thoaught is was what we call in germany a Brombeere
That was an entertaining opening skit just blue lol
I came across this channel by accident and I’m so glad, has become my favorite channel from the useful information to the comedy it’s a perfect mix 😊
I didn’t know about the otter brand of popsicles and didn’t notice it till a few years ago at work. Did anyone else notice that one of the 3 otters on the box looks like he’s copping a feel and the one getting grabbed looks shocked?? It threw me off when I saw it, anyone else notice it too?
I think matpat wants to lick Ariel.
Blue
Blue haired girls… stay away.
Blue he said it loud and clear Mat
I saw a short about this. I was wondering when they'd hit it 😊
i've known since i was a kid that blue raspberry was a synthetic flavor, mostly due to it tasting different to raspberry tea, which i think is ACTUALLY raspberry flavored, but it's never changed the fact that it's still my favorite flavor, by far, even to this day.
i am such an otterpops fangirl, i would watch that theory in a minute
The flavour of blue raspberry?  It's blue.
Not sure if this is used else where, but here in South Africa, blue is the color of bubblegum flavour
Please do a otter pop lore video
like we didn't already know that
Finally someone tackling the important questions
Need to dip into the theory on how food coloring dys affect the human body and mind 🤔
Dan: 🔵
Honestly, I always thought it was just supposed to be Blueberry mixed with Raspberry. More raspberry than Blueberry tho.
Mattpat: Grape doesn’t taste like grape.  Concord grapes: Am I a joke to you?
is pat  pan because the ice cone reminded me of the flag
1:36 hate to break it to you but even that butterfly isn’t really blue.  They are grey with oddly and specifically shaped scales that refract the light to appear blue… or something.
6:55 matpat yes you do yes you do my friend this is how many people want it 👇
Do otterpop lore
I love how by now "blue" is genuinely a flavour for foods
All I know is that Brayden can’t have it.
the only raspberries i encountered are either red or purple...or the purple is suppsoed to be the blue flavour? idunno!
My favorite blue food is blue waffles, I mean just look them up in google images and tell me you wouldn’t want one. :)
Wait wait wait. You're just gonna mention bubble gum flavor and then gloss over what on Earth it is? I know it's not the way xanthan gum tastes.What is bubble gum flavor?
I really want an otter pop lore vid now
The blue on a butterfly's wing isn't even blue.  Just a trick of the light due to the fine structure of it's wing scales.
His wording of licking Ariel threw me off-guard Ariel be like😱😶😮☹️
Grape does have a flavour... purple lol
So ur saying the flavor is blue
Percy Jackson fans (like me) are going to freak when they hear Matt tell us about the Empire State Building turning blue and the blue food. 💙  We know why the Empire State Building REALLY lit up blue.
I was thinking about this just last night
Well that explains a lot… my favorite color has always been blue, but as a kid when I had a “blue raspberry” icee I ended up having an allergic reaction to it and I couldn’t figure out why since I wasn’t allergic to raspberries… but I am severely allergic to cherries…
....Blue
day two of asking if chicken noodle soup actually helps you if you're feeling sick
Blue Rasberry SPK tastes good though...
Water melon is clear with Gatorade and I found that out when I really needed water and vomited up my "expired" water
Its fun how you pronounce De Groote
Dum Dums (lollipops) don't say what flavor it is so either I taste it and find out or I know it by color.
Blue,red,orange,yellow,green, pink,purple are 100% flavors.
I think the reason grape flavors don’t taste like common grapes is because they’re based on the flavor of Concord grapes, a blueish violet species of grape that’s particularly sweet and flavorful
B L U E
Sorry MatPat but I kinda got a spoiler of this video because I watch one of Safia and Tyler’s live streams
De ting! DE TING! Is Blue on da Blue!  (Bonus points for anyone who gets this obscure reference)
Maybe they should rename it to Fruit Punch
My favorite flavor is *b l u e*
Fake grape flavor is great
This flavor has been around at least 30 years and i knew at the outset that it was a made up thing. ( at Sonic ) my children loved it.
The best sour patch kid is watermelon
What do you want dan!? Quit saying my first name!
for us the blue flavor in snow cones is called "Lambada" because of a foreign song that was a hit in 1989. now everyone forgot the song and the flavour is still called Lambada and nobody really knows the origin. in every other candy it's just called blue flavour.
Another banger, thanks MatPat!
6:55 Yes, MatPat. Yes you do have to make a lore theory.
not reverse morpheus if blue is still a lie
Blue food is the best food 😁
*Blue*
i like green
That used to make so mad… everyone’s favorite flavor is “Blue” like what do you mean… Blue is not a flavor it’s a color if you have a red snow cone and I ask you what flavor you got you say cherry not red (orange is an exception for obvious reasons)
Was anyone under the impression that blue raspberry was a real fruit? Edit: grape flavored products are based on Concord grapes, a sweeter, deeper purple variety that is very close to what you'd associate the flavor to, its not quite it but its much closer to the flavor than the grape you buy at the store
The blue glacier freeze gatoraid tastes like fresh crunchy green grapes.  (Edit) now that I’ve watched the video I’m glad to know I’m not crazy
Also yes otter pop lore pls
Dude made a "licking Ariel" joke without mentioning "fishy" and I am impressed at the restraint while also somewhat wishing this channel was...child-unfriendly enough to allow such a joke.
Mat, Nicolas Tesla was the best inventor not that fraud ed*son
Fun fact: Morpho butterflies don't have blue pigment. They aren't truly blue despite looking that way. They're actually brown, but they have fancy scales that scatter light to look blue despite having no pigment. It's called structural coloration.  Blue eyes also don't have blue pigment. It's all just fancy light tricks.   It kinda works like soap bubbles. Like soap bubbles obviously don't have pigments, so they're transparent, but they look colourful because how they scatter light.
12:35 what you Americans call grape makes me thing I’m eating what melted candle wax smells like.
My life is a lie.
Have you done a video on banana flavor and candy and such?
Blue represents depression
now what does bubblegum taste like
blue
Please, please, I NEED an Otter Pop Lore Theory. I beg.
I always assumed that 'blue raspberry' was just that, a colored drink tasting like raspberry?
It is still the best overall flavor although it tastes nothing like anything. My entire life i don't think I've ever bought something blue raspberry and not got exactly what I wanted. You seemingly can't mess that flavor up!   While flavors like pomegranate and cranberry are seemingly impossible to find. Which sucks since I just recently found out I'm in love with pomegranate and it is my favorite fruit as far as tastes go and I need a liver or kidney transplant or death within the year. But it is like a grape fruit and I won't be able to have it. FML!
No matter what happens in this episode, blue will still be my favorite flavor
Can your grape episode also include why grape medicine tastes so bad?
We need a otter pop theory video!!
Oh no!
just bought the leather jacket, love it almost as much as... BLUE  also yes please otter pop vid
But caramel, grape, cherry, banana, lemon, raspberry flavor is my favorite!
You better do Otter Pop lore!
All my favorite flavors are colors.
And not one mention of Hitchcock's Blue Dinner Party...
Yea its fake, but its a combination of 2 flavors. It's just raspberry but blueberry added on
Sour path kids blue tastes like sourness 😎
I like blue-berry flavored stuff
I thought this flavour was just normal raspberry flavour with some more sourness added to it.
Isn't it raspberry and blueberry mixed up?
To me blue raspberry never tasted like raspberry just blue raspberry
Oh I guess I'm fake...
The real theory is why is it spelled "raspberry" when we pronounce it "razzberry"
can you not ruin my favorite things... FOR FIVE MINUTES?!?!
Pov: blue berry in the corner sipping it’s tea
Hello
First of I am not hating I'm a big fan buuuuut blue berries are blue on the outside not the inside I'm pretty sure please tell me if I'm wrong
I remember when I lived in the states for a few years and actually tried “Blue Raspberry” haven eaten many a wild and store bought Raspberries in Scotland…  And I remember asking… “Have you guys ever eaten an actual raspberry?” 😂 Cause this ain’t it !
Alright, who let demoman invent things?
3:25 I live in Brazil, so the flavour of blue around here is associated with "tutti-frutti" which is said to be a mix of various fruit flavours
Isnt it just rasberry with bkue colouring???
Ngl blue just tastes like medicine idk why I like it tho
They've forced that unicorn mermaid flavor crap into ice creams as well. Its an epidemic.
Grape flavor kinda tastes like vomit.
This is one of my Food Theories and I must admit, a big part of that is the visual satisfaction of seeing a lot of things colored blue that aren't naturally blue. I can't explain why, but I just love seeing unnatural, bright recolors, and it's especially strong with blue
why have I been waiting for this
I don't even need to watch this vid to say well DUH of course it's a fake flavor, there is no such thing as a blue raspberry.
OTTER POP LOOOOORE!
I'm with Dan. Snow cone flavors should be like Gatorade, named by color, not flavor
Mermaid flavored yogurt? I would have expected to get this info from a monster girl fetish board rather than mattpat... though I guess I'm not as active there as I use to be.
I always thought it was just raspberry flavor with blue food coloring
He is Groote.
4:33 🤨📸
Blue raspberry is the best flavour behind banana and apple
I love the intro
Can there be a continuation of this with why grape doesn't taste like grape and how banana flavor is actually the synthetic flavor of an extinct fruit
This theory is a certified blue moment
i hate blue rasbery 🤮
When I worked for Rita’s Italian ice, I used to make some of the ices. For blue raspberry, it’s literally just “make blueberry ice but don’t put blueberries in it”
*"POLICE! Drop your weapon!"* Dan: blue...
Did you try getting a staff member to taste these flavours simultaneously?
Matpat binged them brew episodes I see!
Blaubeeren, I guess
1hour!❤❤❤ and omg-
Sour patch doesn't have cherry or strawberry either, it is called redberry. (Which is a raspberry by the way)
"Blue."   -Dan
Okay, and? It may be fake but I will enjoy it anytime of the week
Looks like these companies have been calling sally Jackson fir their R&D
I loved otter pops as a kid. I do remember that on the back the had a pic of that color pop and they’re names. Man, I wish I could fine them nowadays! (Take me back to the 80’s)
I don't like the blue raspberry flavor because I enjoy real raspberry flavor and my brain isn't fooled.
why is bro so mad this episode lol
Video 12 of asking mat pat to do a film theory on murder drones
As long as you're also bringing up grape, try having a few after throwing them in the freezer. Still doesn't taste like grape flavor, but I swear they're a bit sweeter frozen. The change in texture is also kinda an experience
Please do otter pop food theory. I would love it.
Grape tastes like glove
This is click bait this is not an Episode about sour patch kids
Blue raspberry is still the best jolly rancher flavour
There are berries Called Brombeeren in germany wich are litterally blue/purple ish raspberries
But... Orange sour patch Kids are the best...
4:30  🤨
Blue Rasberry may be fake, but it's my favourite.
Cool blue Gatorade tastes like citrus
I have actually never heard of a blue raspberry in my country... Just the regular kind. Our blue/purple candy is blueberry flavoured (they say)
Other pop vid
🅱️ *L* *U* *E*
I thought they made it blue because red is for cherry one of the most popular flavors
Hey MatPat! You should really make a role video on the videogame Dead Cells! Very good game <3
Let be real with enough genetic engineering we could possibly make real blue raspberry
Maybe matpat could do a theory
Blue gatorade is cherry in Germany
Cherry flavours are always best
It tastes like blue!
Instead of style theory, how about fashion theory
Blue Raspberry? More like Blue Jazzberry.
4:32 patpat knows this was every 90s kids wet dream 😂
I'm here for the Otter Pops lore for sure
Do Pikmin
Blue is a flavor!!!!!!
THE COLOR OF THE PEN THAT I HOLD IN MY HAND IS 0:45
blue.
Malic acid is a pretty classic "sour apple" taste. Those powered packets of "hot apple cider" for instance have a lot (plus sugar).
I've been waiting for this video
We do need an theory on why no candy flavor tastes like its really world counterparts because I’ve heard ALOT of really strange reason why
As someone who has often wondered about this, I'm glad to finally have an answer. And now I'm also hoping for an eventual otter pop lore video
My favorite candy flavor is R E D Which red? idk, red.
My favorite flavor is blue!
blue is the warry best flawor.
Me who just thought it was blueberry and raspberry combined
I never heard of blue raspberry. Which isn't surprising since it's origin story is based on American culture history and I'm living in Germany.
“Now we know what licking aerial would taste like” -MatPat 2023
Hold on, is it me or did the style theory logo not glitch out along with Matthew's voice when he mentioned it? Usually, that happens whenever he mentions a sister channel.
Gatorade tastes like starfruit or carambola.
i think we can call that flavor Blue and get away with it!
With how everyone says raspberry it's got me wondering how would the Pokémon "berries" taste? Would it just be the fruit they're based on (one that will annoy you a bit matpat, Oran berry is just a blue orange XD (yes the berries names are just the fruits they're based on with a small difference like wiki berry obvs kiwi nanab-banana (write banana backwards n take the last letter off)))
Wow! Probably one of the best theory cold openers ever.
I have blue raspberry so lets see how this goes
Food theory: can I copy you Chikn nuggit: OK but change it up so it’s not obvious
Im suprised air up didnt sponsor this episode, its literally the same science
4:35 wow matpat
BLUEBERRIES ARE FRICKING PURPLE
Id love an episode on why grapes and bananas and strawberry candy taste the way they do. Its so different and I heard it was something about older species of the fruit. I wanna know what it might taste like
Is there some arg going on with the static in these videos? Sometimes the screen glitches in various videos
Tbf this is the same thing as the "grape" flavor of most things being the flavor.....purple
I’m pretty sure the grapes flavor comes from Concord grapes because those taste like grape soda and candy.
2:39 percy jackson lol
Grape Hi-Chew are the best grape candy I have had yet.
Matpat you hurt me, blue raspberry is my favorite flavor :(  Also I realize that blue raspberry is not an actual flavor it is just gud :P
Watching this as a european is so confusing, raspberry is dark red, strawberry light red and cherry is purple here lol
So this is an oddly timed video as I only just got the G fuel I ordered today and it’s blue raspberry, I’ve never tried it before and I only really picked it as the last two I got had this yellow/orange colour too them and it made it look like I was drinking pee so I when with something blue to change it up (ied already tried a red a reddish pink and a purple colour, purple been the nicest to my palette so far that been clickbate, I hate the naming scheme of gfule) and it’s the nicest one yet not too sweet and just sour enough.  Ied never heard of a blue raspberry before this week it seems to be a US thing.
The blue flavour taste like blue ( I can taste colours)
Isnt blue raspberry just blackberry????
I Don't care if "Blue Raspberry" is a lie; IT'S STILL MY FAVORITE FLAVOR!!!
Honestly Dan same my favorite is Blue haha
the grape candy is flavored after concord grapes
Mat, you really should do a video on grape.
Fun fact: Thomas Edison didn't invent anything, he just patented them and marketed them. For example, Nikola Tesla invented the Lightbulb.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Grape candy actually does taste like grapes, just not like the table grapes you can normally buy at the store. My cousin grows wine grapes in her back yard and they taste almost EXACTLY like the flavor of grape candy.
“Now I get to know what licking Ariel tastes like” 💀💀
"Now We Know What Licking Ariel Would Taste Like"...Mat Are You Ok bruv?
Blue is the best flavor 😋
Did... did everyone not already know this? I thought this was common knowledge. I remember telling the guys at the gas station I wanted a raspberry slushy while pointing at the blue one when I was four. Now I feel weird.
I was literally just telling someone last week how blue raspberry is the greatest artifical flavor ever created lmao
8:13  I heard it from you
Don’t Blue Berries exist?
OTTER POP LORE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
"Now we know what licking Ariel would taste like" 😳
There is literally a berry in Sweden that's called "blue raspberry" and looks exactly like a blue raspberry on a raspberry-like bush. Called "Rubus caesius" or "Salmbär/Psalmbär".  More related to Blackberries though probably.
Blue taste like citrus
Food Theory idea: How much head (foam) can you get out of a pour of beer?
Hey MatPat, I've seen that blue can also be the color of cotton candy in some candies to this day.  😀
Does subjecting your subjects... I mean employees to cringey scripts count as abuse
Still waiting for the otter pop episode
1h
"now we know what licking ariel would taste like" i am only slightly disturbed at how casually that came out of your mouth 😂
In almost every single one of matpats videos for a couple years now, he throws a hint out that he is decidedly on one side of an argument. He's basically indoctrinating fans to a certain belief structure so subtly the soviets would be jealous.  But does anyone know what it is? Wish I had the means to make a "theory theory" channel. Lol
Petition for MatPat to do an otter pop lore episode
Blue
Blue
"What flavor did you get?"  "Blue".  I felt that in my soul and I agree. Blue is the best flavor
My take away.....Otter Pop Lore
Im gonna be waiting for the otter pop episode
do a theory on Starbucks or coffee in general lol
I always thought blue raspberry was just raspberry + blueberry
When someone asks my favorite Gatorade,  Me 0:38  Edit: I didn't realize Gatorade would be said
Sweet blue raspberry is the worst flavour of all time. Unless you are adding in citric acid, it's garbage.
Blue👍
Finally somebody else who's a grape guy
Not me vaping a blue razz ice elfbar rn
Unicorn pudding is my favorite kind
Blue poison cool. Fav sniper
Blue berries  are purple
I've often wondered why when I like raspberry flavoured reddish things, I so dislike blue raspberry flavoured things.  You've explained it. It's a fruit salad flavour which includes that hideous outdated artificial Cavendish. I hate Cavendish flavour. 🤢  BTW, I'm sooooo with you on the grape flavour. Finding a good one is always an adventure and damned near impossible when searching for a good grape soda.  Jolly Ranchers and Now and Laters are life!
Who just thinks that the flavor is just blue Berry. 👇.                👇
Bro had a 5 minute intro
Matpats snow cone is a reversed Romania flag.
Just like my happiness.
Still my favorite artificial fruit flavor, but unrelated, raspberry is also my favorite berry.
Wow, Matpat realized blue raspberry isn’t a real fruit. I get more impressed with this man every day
Blue.
Blue has the most antioxygens
BUT WHAT ABOUT BLUE RASPHBERRY SEEDS?!! WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU PLANT THEM
"NOW WE ALL KNOW WHAT LICKING ARIEL WOULD TASTE LIKE" - Matt Pat 2023
Call blue sucks. It’s the worst Gatorade flavor it ever.
I have a theory. A FILM THEORY that all of us are dead (Netflix TV show) is the prequel to #Alive let me explain. All of us are dead have a really special zombie virus that evolves over time so what if after they bombed the tings with the zombie's some of them survived (trapped in a cave or something) and when #Alive happens they got let out and after all of this time they evolved into         having some of the memories of before they got zombiefied making the zombie's from #Alive  But that is just a theory. A FILM THEORY Thanks for reading.
blu
THANK YOU! I have been struggling for YEARS over why we go with blue raspberry instead of blueberry flavor and finally all my questions have been answered!
YES!!......ahemm yes you have to do an otterpop lore if there be one 🤣🤣
A mix of a blueberry and a raspberry
The most shocking part of this video to me is that you call zooper doopers “otter pops”
Otter pop theory NOW
I’ve been telling people blue raspberry is my favorite artificial flavor and they almost always question what’s the flavor like or what’s in it; can never give them a solid answer till now 😂😂
My mouth has always watered when ive seen something blue. I once was so tempted to eat copper sulfate solution
Blue.
Why do some artificial fruit flavours taste nothing like the fruit they are supposed to mimic? Example. Banana Laffy Taffy
good vid but why did the intro take 5 minutes
I always thought blue raspberry was just the normal raspberry flavor with a little more tartness
don’t tell Percy Jackson. He’s been through enough. Let him enjoy his blue food!💙😜🧜‍♂️
I saw a secret message in a glitchy bit on a DAD video on one of your other channels. It said: ‘To anyone who can see this I need your help but tell no one  MatPat continues to (Thy?) to pay us in cans of Food and floods us With assignments to Obey The Server, Please, if you see this I need you to- ‘ ERROR 5341564554484545444954415253 Render Failed’ What does this mean Matpat? What are you doing to your editors? Also I didn’t listen to them at all.
Grape flavors are nasty, i like grapes but grape flavored things are disgusting
I absolutely gotta try strawberry/watermelon/coconut combo... And then probably what to replace watermelon with, maybe sour cherry, that could be a nice contrast
Me who already knew this:
Blue . Blue Buuuuuuueeeeee
The otter pop lore video needs to be a thing!
If you ever go to latin america, you should try kolita flavor
I also think blue raspberry is just a cheaper flavor to produce because candy like jolly ranchers and sour patch kids are always something like 50% blue raspberry to 50% everything else.
4:48 There a sour patch kids energy drinks Where do they sell these I need it
First
Welp, they blue the budget on that intro
Dude 😂blue raspberry’s are real, i have a friend from Australia 🇦🇺.
Claim your within an hour ticket here
I just learned that the "wild blackberries" that grew in my backyard as a kid were actually a kind of raspberry. Thanks matpat!
RUBUS CAESIUS is a variety of blue raspberry. we have them in Sweden 🇸🇪
Fun fact: grape flavor does in fact taste like grapes. But it's just a different kind of grapes that you normally eat.
1ch 139kw reality 108kw prewaq
This is by FAR my favorite flavor!
huh
Why is banana flavor yellow? The only part of the banana that is yellow is the peal, as far as I know, nobody eats that part.
Please do an otter pop video!!!
Cool Blue Gatorade tastes like pineapple, and it's disgusting.
I’ve been waiting for this!
Blue
Didn't Dan leave the team?
blueberry's are purple matpat
I absolutely LOVE blue raspberry, but yeah, I knew offhand that it's not a natural flavor.
4:34 yeah but they are cute and fun me I will eat these
Blue tastes like sugar
IM BLU DA BU DE DA YOU DIE
The Mandela effect
But that’s just a theory   An OTTERPOP THEORY ANNNNND CUT
Look at Welcome home you'll love it.
Dan is basically blue guy from the Eiffel 65 song
Omg I was actually thinking about this the other day!!! Lmao
Give us the Otter Pops lore! I've never even heard of Otter Pops, but I am immediately hooked on their backstory.
is amouranth still streaming?
12:12 ... ...so~ *I should stay away from the Ghost energy drink, then....!*
I aways thought it was a fusion of blueberries and raspberries. Even as a kid I thought they just fused the names together due to the flavors being fused together.
I loved hearing matpat scream at the start.
perfect thing i needed today
Blue, blue.
Me drinking my blue raspberry prime while watching
So strange how my coworker mentioned that blue raspberry is sent a real flavor like 4 days ago and you ended up posting this!
12:36 I hate normal grapes but I love grape flavouring.
B l o o.
Blue raspberry is actually the WORST flavor and you can’t change my mind.   Well honestly it’s just ok. It’s way overrated though
Need a shirt of the blue snow cone with just "Flavor: Blue"
Grape flavor is like banana it represents a less common version, the Concord grape. Which taste like grape flavoring.
TL:DR it's blue because they can't make it red because Cherry flavor is red. it's marketing, it's always marketing
grape is flavered of a diff grape
Aren't blueberries purple though, Matt?
Its my first time in life that i heard a flavor called blue rasberry in my country we have smurf flavor
Mmm, sugarberry.
Finally mat broke, and it was by otter pops 😂
I've eaten dark blue raspberries... At least it's super similar species. It grew wildly in our yard...
I haven’t watched the full video yet ( 5:01 here rn ) but I’m just gonna guess it’s blueberry x raspberry or a completely artificial flavor  Ok it’s just a weird fruit artificial acidic fruit punch so ig I was right :]
Blue is a good flavor.
That blue flavoured snowcone be lookin good
I thought it was blueberries and raspberries mixed together...
THE INTRO IS BACK!!!
I, for one, would enjoy an Otter Pop lore video.
otter pop theoryyyyy
#Otterpoplore
Another great video ive been here sence the start of this channal and now im here for the start of style theory
This kinda explains why I prefer muscat grape flavored snacks then some more inconsistent “grape” flavors…
Blue FROOT LOOPS came out late too! Froot Loops were created in 1963, but the *Blue Froot Loop* was introduced in 1996😱
BLUE
*”B L U E”*
The Snow Cone Corporation (Gold Medal) was the first brand to use blue raspberry in a commercial product. They released their Snow Cone Syrup in 1958.
As a synesthete, if you tell me you got a blue flavored snow cone, I'll accept that as a completely valid answer.
BlackBerries are Kinda blue I guess…?
hi
I'm the same with popsicles. What flavor did I get. Red. Blue. Pink. Purple. Amazing flavors 😂
Apple pear and sometimes grape I told my daughter this years ago ... And she hated me for it cause all she can taste now is apple ..... Or grape ....
Blue.
Edison? really? Edison? he didn't do anything. He just stole everything.
I always assumed Blue rasberry was a flavor fusion of blueberry and raspberry
Turn CC on in the intro.
Grape episode pls
No, Dan is right, blue is a flavor. Because it DEFINITELY does NOT taste like raspberry. So -> blue.
"Last pick on the field"  No wonder I love raspberry so much: it understands me.
An episode on artificial banana flavouring would also be interesting
i like watermelon or strawberry
On someone who remembers the lesson on blue dart frogs and other poisonous creatures I trust this man
Basically, 1. Caramel 2. Grape/Cherry 3. Banana 4. Malic Acid
Any Gen Xer could tell you there is definitely Otter Pop characters and lore to be found there. I miss the old character specific packaging!
Would it be the same with blue strawberries???
OTTER POP LORE! OTTER POP LORE! OTTER POP LORE! OTTER POP LORE! OTTER POP LORE! OTTER POP LORE!
Morning
Grape flavoring is based on concord grapes which are not commonly sold in stores in their fresh variety due to their "slip-skin" which causes the pulp from separating from the peel quite easily.
I'm glad you called me out the second after I said blue m&ms taste like chocolate
Blue is actually breaking bad flavour
HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
Grape flavor does taste like grapes, concord grapes specifically as "table " grapes i.e. the ones your used to don't have much flavor beyond sweetness.
I've heard that grape flavor is based on a grape just not the table grapes we think of this could be completely wrong so grain of salt
I need that otter pop looooorrreeee video in my life
Darn I loved blue rasberry
Mat has some really good rants in this episode 😂
The video I didn't know I needed but I very much did
We need an otter pop lore video!
Blue is my favorite color but not my favorite flavor for anything
BLUE!
What about blackberries and blackcurrants?
Blue has got to be the best
I didn't know that name pf flavor was so prominent in the US. I'm pretty sure in México we just call it "mora azul" - blueberry
blue
When I saw the title, I was like "No Sh*t"
For the record I would LOVE an otter-pop lore theory
My favourite flavour that I only found in a store ONCE
CHIKN NUGGIT REFERENCE!!! 0:22
Blue
Even as a kid, I always kind of figured it was just raspberry or something based on the taste. It was my favorite flavor and I liked the color blue, so I always ate the "blue" raspberry candy and snow cones
Dan is Blue Da bu dee da bu Di, da bu dee da bu di
Blue.
Im british and actually have no idea what blue raspberry is, i always assumed it was jut american for blackberry but it tastes nothing like blackberry. Very occasionally, you’ll go to the foreign foods section and find some american sweets and  just be utterly confused by the blue raspberry. Like tastes of sugar and makes ur tongue blue. Also we don’t have grape flavouring here. On the couple times ive tried something grape flavoured (and it’s always something American) it just does not taste like grapes. You guys are built differently, istg
grape to be fair does (kinda) taste like grape juice
Who tf likes grape were is my orange and cherry gang
Grape flavor tastes like Concord grapes. Not regular grapes. I'd definitely be interested in seeing a theory about that!
We must embrace *b l u e* flavour
I love raspberry but hate blue raspberry 😅
Well this makes blue raspberry make more sense I new it was a made up flavor and this made me happy about my question being answered
I cant believe matpat said blue berries are blue!! Blue berries are purple!
um didn't dan die?
In Brazil most blue flavored things are named "tuti-fruti" (all fruit in... italian? Idk) or some version of the concept of the sky 😃
Was thinking about this exact thing yesterday, like what is “blue raspberry” is it just raspberry with blue coloring or is it something else? so this video really came at the perfect timing.
i'm pretty sure the actual blue flag that indicates danger is the one you seen whenever you're lapping [insert laughably bad F1 driver here]
I feel like "blue raspberry" would just be considered fruit punch, if that wasn't already an established flavor profile.
they are technically real
Blue is also my fav
I'm a blue raspberry MTN Dew guy, myself. 😁
I used to think Blue Raspberry was a hybrid flavor of blueberry and Raspberry haha
"...Devin Groote is the second greatest inventor, behind Thomas Edison..." well...isn't anyone who invented ANYTHING a better inventor then Edison... since he stole a majority (if not all) of his "inventions" 💥🫰💥  #LoveforNikolaTesla  #BringMetheDeathBeam
As someone who has seen "randy writes a book" a stand up comedy show put on by the comedian randy feltface BLUE BERRIES ARE FRICKEN PURPLE Thank you Also don't eat blue stuff it has sharks in it

Red is always the best.  Love the Mike & Ike all reds
The Gatorade is not flavored Blue, it's actually cool flavored, while just happening to be blue.
Blue labadeebadei die dee
I pick the blue flavor almost always and I only just realized that it’s almost always just called blue
maybe using licking a women wasn't the best analogy even if she is a fictional character LUL
4:03 as soon as he said it, all i thought about was this (young viewers be warned there is a bit of swearing in this 15 second clip) https://youtu.be/2skYAdEmbRM
is that a bluey refrance
blue raspberry "mimics the flavor of blackcap raspberry Rubus leucodermis, a wild berry most of us have never seen or eaten" -north dakota state university
I always knew blue raspberry was a lie, but I never knew what it was actually supposed to be
I always thought it was blueberry raspberry
I still can’t believe you made me say that I like Grape flavour…
pansexual snowcone????
Someone send this to Dylan.
Pls do do a otter pop lore theory by the way great theory idea !
I’m still gonna eat blue raspberry stuff
The new dan animation looks more like him irl.
I’m just sad no one said “”Da ba dee da ba di””
1:30 "blue is rare because there isn't a lot of it"

"BLUEBERRIES ARE F*CKING PURPLE!" - Randy Feltface
0:26, its so cute and adorable!!!!!! Head editor dan sounds like hes tired of this already
otter-pops theory when?!?!?!?!?!?!
We need otterpop lore
Me: * sees intro * My head: https://youtube.com/shorts/qXtIh8ZZssw?feature=share
I’ve never known what an otter pop is, but I want the lore now.
Grape flavor = purple
Why did I think the blue sour patch kid was blue Berry 😶  I feel extra stupid now 😢
Pink lemonade was invented by accident when a circus worker washed his red tights in the water for lemonade. Yeah think about that next time you sip on your pink lemonade...
Grape flavor doesn't taste like grocery store grapes, but it does taste vaguely like concord grapes, the intensely flavorful grapes they use to make grape jam.
I hate blue but now knowing it's one of the rarest is nice
"Blue rarely occurs in nature" The Ocean:
Blue
I'm from Germany so I was really confused when I found out you guys are naming the mystery blue flavor raspberry. We also have the blue flavor and I believe it tastes the same but it's being marketed as blueberry here which makes much more sense.  For gummy bears and stuff like that: Pinkish red: raspberry Wine red: cherry Orangy red: strawberry Deeper darker reds: other matching Berries to the shade Watermelon candy isn't a huge here but it's always green and red
I honestly always just assumed raspberry flavours were blue to differentiate it from strawberry. If you get handed a red sweet its usually always strawberry, so having a slightly different shade of red for raspberry would be confusing. Heck in the UK we have a brand of jelly babies called bassets and they dont use the blue for raspberry and yes, most of the time you dont know what flavour you're getting if you pick out red/pink lol.
Blue!
Dude grape flavor is grape flavored. Just not table grapes its a different kind of grape. Figured you'd have known that...
Matpat screams because he knows the flavor is, indeed, blue.
On the "Blue is the rarest natural pigment" argument, I present to you: Purple.
Scissors for Otterpops? Nah, they break open. Seriously, no sharps needed.
Do the otter pop lore
Fun fact grape flavors are based on the concord grape. You can find them for sale in some grocery stores.
Blue.
blue
I was thinking about it and it popped up in my recommended. Thanks matpat.
As someone for a country that dosent have otter pops i need to know more wtf😂
"BLUE"
i dont even like blue rasberry
The first blue raspberry candies I remember where blue raspberry blow pops
4:28 in and need to comment: grape flavored things do try to mimic grape flavor but it is a specific type of grape.  And I've always assumed blue raspberry was blueberry and raspberry just kinda shortened down cause it makes it easier to say
Blue berrys are f*cking purple
Blue
Team blue flavor.
0:21 blue.
come on man, blue is the best flavor
Blue.
okay so wrong channel, but for style theory can you please do a theory on Edna Modes outfits in the Incredibles?
Matpat really had to make a video to expose that Blue Raspberries aren't real smh
Blue!
7:26 what are you on about, a single color can have multiple flavor oassosiations. Blue is taken by blueberry, so thats also already taken.
4:02 blueberries are PURPLE. NOT. BLUE.
First time I actually felt called out by MatPat for saying blue M&Ms taste like chocolate
Alright internet, it's time to genetically modify raspberries in order for them to taste like blue raspberries.
What flavor is bubble gum?
i like flavor  red and Blue
Oh man I love blue.  I used to get blue Rock Pop (the brand) soda at a convenience store a block from my house after school.  And blue jolly ranchers are awesome.  And I'm only half trying to drive MatPat up a ball 🤣
Bl and I cannot stress this enough UE 😂 Head Editor Dan knows what's up 😂
Matt! I think these two facts might interest you!  1. In Brazil, blue raspberry is actually denominated “tutti-frutti” as the packaging states it actually is a mash of different fruit flavours, like you found!  2. I think it would be interesting to do a video on how the UK has no grape flavored things; all sweets, juices alike Capri-Suns, and popsicles/ice lollies are Blackcurrant flavoured! To the point in which my British friends were absolutely baffled by the notion of “grape candies” elsewhere in the world!
Given the name, I had always assumed it was just blueberry & raspberry... go figure. 🤷
Blue. Okay, so why doesn't Pistachio pudding taste like pistachios?
Was the dont over ariel you telling my mind not to go there?😅
Mamba candy still has a red raspberry flavor.
BLUEBERRIES ARE PURPLE
Lol
i have just associated blue with 'bubblegum' flavour
Do an otter pops lore video
having known this for a long time, it was actually a big reason why it's always been my favorite flavor.
Blue
BLUUUUUE
"Grape doesn't take like grape"  Not true, grape actually does taste like grapes, just not the ones you would buy from a store. Their flavor is actually based off concord grapes, which have a much more powerful flavor, thus making them an excellent choice for candy where the flavor is kinda what people are asking for, a storebought grape is too light to get anything for grape flavored candies, sodas, etc.
My favorite is red...
Yes you should make an otter pops LOREEEEEEEEE video
you can make a difference
What about the blue smarties? When the blue smartie was removed it made so many people angry the company made a whole commercial around the blue smartie coming back!
Licking Ariel? Giggity
Good thing Pink Lemons are totally real...
Iz blue.
I wish blue raspberries were real 🥲
blue
I could've sworn I ate a blue raspberry at one point in my life.
HOW DARE YOU SAY THAT MY FAVORITE FLAVOR IS A LIE!!! #unsubcribed
Can we please get an otter pop lore video? I’m SSSSOOOO down!
Blue
Blue
🫐
blue
I want an otterpop lore video!   I went to college out of state and everyone I met there was convinced I was crazy when I talked about otterpops because apparently they just don't have them in Florida or something. I need a video to send to my friends to prove my sanity.
I don't care, I love it!
Watermelon is green, light pink or salmon collored
Otterpop lore. Yes. I must know why.
Otter Pop Lore when??
It was kinda funny how when I checked the label of a cherry juice, the only 2 fruits mentioned were apples and lemons hahaha and both probably in small quantities
blue
Ok lol I honestly never knew about blue raspberry, still enjoied the video.
3:25 it may be a cultural difference, but here blue is usually some kind of mint (usually when they have more than one mint flavour, like spearmint, peppermint and menthol). Sometimes, for some reason, it's pineapple. The rest of the time, either what they call "electric blue", which is sour for sure, or blueberry (way less common).
"now we know what licking Arielle would taste like" is from now on my favourite Matpat sentence ever!
🎉
Another banger from game man!
Blue.
Matpat, Are the Greek gods inbreed
I love flavor blue
That intro feel like a animated series thing lol
blue
Me who always assumed it was just raspberries and dyed blue, cuz I hate blueberries
🎵🎶"I'm blue, da bu de, da you die"🎶🎵. 🤣
This isn't Bluey...
Blue berries are purple
Its blue flavored.
Sorry mat but grape flavor is the disgusting
In our Backyard, we have Wild Blackberries.
Always just thought it was blueberry/raspberry and called the mix blue-raspberry for short. Never once in my life have I ever thought there was a blue colored raspberry. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Do the otter pop lore 👀
Just saw shane dawsons theory video even he covered this, crazy
i love the taste of blue
Blue berry 💀
Anyone else notice how long it's been since he's used the actual intro on this channel
Raspberrys are one of my favourite tastes. But only the berrys, in best case out of the own garden
I drink all of blue Gatorade all of em  I realized a long time ago it was lemon with a hint of sugary sweetness from some berry but but yesterday weirdly I looked and they use citric acid which is why the Gatorade taste so much more like lemon. ( not that they say they're blue raspberry tho)
Blue is my spirit animal
blue is also my favorite flavor much superior to red
Blue is the best flavor
So raspberry used to use red dye but now goes as blue raspberry using blue dye. Can’t wait for the video on the grape flavor to get a video about PURPLE DYE?!?!
Blue is not a creative colour
3:40 it just sounds like matpat is gaslighting us
Blue is associated with sadness, like the blues music!
Head editor dan is me xD "Blue"
Crazy how the color indigo is named from a poison
I've been saying it's just blue flavor for years!
Hi
I have been wondering about blue raspberry too, and this has helped a lot. But I’m still wondering about tootsie pops. They have raspberry, but it’s normal pink. Will they ever make it blue?
My immediate thought on seeing the thumbnail alone was 'how dare you'
What flavor did you get? "Blue"😑
"blu" "EEEEAAAAAGHHHHHHHAAAH" "blu" "ahhhhhhhhhhhhh" "bluuuuuuuuu"
Turns out when Dan says “blue” he chose not to finish the word with Berry 😉
This looks like a fun episode! *sips MD voltage*
What flavor did you get? Blue.  The fact that we understand what flavor they mean shows have powerful color is for our taste and enjoyment lol it's like Gatorade. I don't know any of the flavor names outside of just calling them the color.
Finally, the answer to the world's biggest question: what is blue raspberry?
It's funny that we know what you mean by blue taste despite that sounding like nonsense.
I never realised blue raspberry is ?? Like a real thing? And not like a one off, some brand trying to be quirky, kind of thing. (Im Not from the states lol ) this is so wild like, over here raspberry is pink , strawberry red and cherry a deeper red. blue candy is rare and just generally understood to be the flavor "artificial sweet" or just . . sweet lol
I want blue flavor
i always said it was blueberry flavored...
okok but for the garorade my favorite flavor is green apple like its jacksepticeye green colored and tastes like a jolly rancher but its really hard to find
I'm ready for the otter pop lore
Are we sure it's not just blue berry and raspberry
Yea no crap its a lie but boy howdy do it taste great
A red fruit being faked??? reallly??? noo waaayy
Anything grape flavored is acutely made to taste like concord grapes they are just very rarely eaten anymore
Day one of asking for an otterpops lore video
🥶🥶🥶
"The flavor profile of raspberry was developed using mostly esters of the banana, cherry, and pineapple variety. Sugar is commonly used to create taste appeal for the blue raspberry flavoring." There you go, saved you 13 min of your life.
My dreams have been crushed
I don't think we need a whole theory explaining that grape flavor is meant to mimic concord grapes instead of table grapes. Anyone that's had a cheap glass of wine knows as much, lol.
blue
I know MatPat didn't just bash dragon flavored jello when dragon fruit exists and both the dragon on the box and the jello itself are the red and green of the fruit itself
blue
i love soft core
blue
Blue tastes like Pepsi.  Lol
i like eating raspberries right off the tree
Fun fact: Pink lemonade was made because a circus ran out of water for lemonade, so they used water that the acrobats used to wash their clothes. Because of the fact that the acrobat's clothes were red, it dyed the water pink, so they marketed it as "pink lemonade."
Dan Cybert, official Blue Enjoyer
I actually always associated raspberry and blue raspberry as two separate flavors. Apparently, I was the only one.
I totally forgot about otter pops I used to eat those as a kid in NM.
Blueberry erasure.
I like how food theory is about processed food and almost never about good diet.
Bro I never understood blue raspberry, it tastes gross, and now I'm validated by the fact that it isn't even a real thing. Today is a happy day for me!
It doesn't taste like grape it tastes so much worse! I will die on the hill of anything "grape flavored" taste like garbage
fun fact: the blue morpho isnt actully blue its just microscopic structures built to only reflect blue light same with blue is but its diffrent. the only animal with a true blue coloring is a Olive wing Butterfly.
I have a question, I've been told my whole life that I need to eat my five fruit a day but now I ask the question does five fruit a day actually help you and if it does what fruit should I be eating to get the best results???
grape does taste like grape, just not table grapes. grape flavor is based on concord grapes, which have a much more distinct flavor.
have you ever gust had a good look at the intro
Plz plz make otter pop lore plz!
How about a food theory on that disgusting cherry 🍒/ grape 🍇 flavor medicine I had as a kid. I can't be the only one who experienced this.
Blue need a flavor while other color got fruit flavor. Blue got nothing beside berries
Well.... duh? It's because they had blue food coloring and too many red things so at some point companies tried it with raspberry and it stuck
I think matpat can read my mind because I was thinking about this the last video
4:32 PHRASING!
blueberry.
when you have blue eyes and well
Where's the otter pop lore poll, Cause I'm TOTALLY IN!!!
Surprisingly, I just got finished with a giant bag of only blue raspberry sour patch kids 🤦‍♂
Otterpop LORE?! I've always just eaten them. I didn't know there was a story.
BLUEEEEEEEEEE FLAVOURRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
claim your here from today ticket    👇
person from europe here what are sour patch kids?
4:32 Totally worth watching this video for! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Matpats snow cone has the flag of Romania 🇷🇴 or chad 🇹🇩
Otter Pop lore video would be crazy
blue
Blue is the flavor of blue.   Blue is the Chad flavor. It does not elaborate.
So there is no Blue Raspberry
Me, who loves synthetic chemistry   🤷
🎶The most human color....🎶

1:08 the worst joke you've ever made
My man said we know what it tastes like to lick Ariel 😂😂😂
0:45 Dan’s ASMR ‘Blueeeehhh’ meanwhile Mat is having a beautiful meltddown in the background. Top notch entertainment within seconds 👏🏼
This was more educational then my entire biology lesson. Thank you MatPat.
Who cares blue is the best flavor.
Dear lord this is what I have been needing today! Thank you Food Theory!!!
Hey Matpat can you please do a theory on whether or not lightyear has good sandwichs
blue
Reminds me of Randy Feltface "blueberries are f-ing purple"
You don't *have* to do an episode about Otter Pop lore theory.   That being said, please make an episode about Otter Pop lore theory. Even if it has to wait for 2024 or 2025 April Fools or beyond.   kthx
Blueberries are purple
i loves this intro so much
The theme song is back! Yaaaaaaay!
Blueberry, blue goo, bluegrass Blue cows😂😂
Fun fact, grape flavor is grape flavored, specifically like a concord grape.
Hehehehe..... Bule
COOL BLUE IS MY FAVORITE GATORADE 😳
_Bloooooo..._  is the best flavor that doesn't actually exist in nature.
An Otter-Pop lore video must be made, I need that in my late night YouTube rabbit hole
I used to work in a restaurant and I would try to sell adios's because they are a blue long island. Anytime someone would order one someone would ask what it was and order one themselves. Eventually my whole section would have blue drinks on their table. I don't know what it is about blue drinks but people like them.
well blue raspberry is my fav flavor cuz i can't have red 40 and that's in a TON of food, mainly candy and sweet treats
I did the take the red pillee if you say so i never got foled in to flavors im natruly more inteligent our waht i nevre got waht you mean its always tast like watter no flavor at all 😒
MatPat: “They lit up the Empire State Building in blue”  Me: “PERCY JACKSON”
4:04 BLUE BERRYS ARE PURPLE
So when's the lore video for Otter Pops?
I never knew about blue raspberry. Where I grew up, all those blue foods were called “smurf” flavor. And who can argue with what a smurf tastes like…
BLUEBERRIES ARE PURPLE MATT!!!
Grape, cherry, banana, and acid.  So appetizing.
Licking  Ariel
If you see this I hope you have a good day
i have blue eyes why arent i venomous?😭
Blue
waittt... what if i make artificial raspberry dna and plant it?
As a child I didn't even know blue was supposed to be any fruit flavor. Most things (like Slushies) where sold as 'do you want red or blue?' and I just wanted blue because it was my favorite color. If anything was blue I would eat it. No matter the flavour. XD
yeah... we know...
We should get pink and purple m&ms now! 😮 Come on, It’s 2023, #p&pm&m
Hi
This is my third time asking for an "iron lung" game theory
Dans blue made me smile
*sees video title*  *sigh* Alright MatPat, how are you about to ruin my favorite flavor of literally every candy?  *clicks video*
I’m gonna show my sister this. She loves the blue raspberry. Meanwhile I like cherry
Fun Fact the reason artificial banana flavors don't taste like banana us because they're based off a type of banana that already went extinct several years ago
1 otter pop theory please
If we don’t get otter pop lore I will unsubscribe
German here, the blue dye makes it taste better. There I said it.
i always assumed it was Blueberry and Rasberry fused
Ah yes my beautiful blue eyes warn of my dangerously big biceps…    Or they will be, in a few more years…
My sister loves blue raspberry, and I have always known blue colored raspberries dont exist, my freind grew them in gardens. My dad said it was just called and dyed blue to not mix it up with strawberry or cherry. I always thought blue berry should have been a more blue color, despite it being more purple. I remember this! You did an episode on color and flavor by sending gummies to your freezer and they guessed what flavors they were! I guess we really all can-- taste colors. PS. The m&m's are chocolate PPS. DO AN OTTER POPS LORE SERIES A DEVOUR LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
The start was funny😂😂
I am suprised that blue raspberry isn't 97% apple
Isn't grape candy/soda based off of concord grapes?
Matpat, aren't you a little young for "the Blue Pill" ?
Your Rong this time pat my dad's farm grows blue ressberrys dude
I have been buying products from gold medal from years. They have been established as a business Before the creation of icee. So I'm pretty sure they created the blue raspberry  flavor we know today.
Otter pops? Americans are sometimes weird. I have Freezies
when you said “least harmful” that really didn’t fill me with confidence matpat
We all want to see the lore of the otter pops!
Cool blue is citrus. What kind of citrus I do not know
blue is auger
Blue chain
super
So blue raspberry is an artificial fruit punch in a sense.
Maybe so, btu I still love it.
BLUEBERRIES ARE F-ING PURPLE!!!! - Randy Feltface
So is it safe to assume “blue raspberry” was probably developed as some sort of contract between a chemical company and the fda?
I think I speak for most of us when I say we need the Other Pop theory on film theory.
In Germany ITS not blue rasberry
blub
blue raspberry has always reminded me of when i make pie with blueberry and raspberry mixed together... at least the kool aid blue raspberry drinks
4:33 Pause
Oh my gosh I need the otter pop lore
Matpat, grape flavor does taste like grapes Concord grapes
Blue is the best flavour tho
Can someone cross bread blue berry's and razz berry's already
Dan saying "blue" just affirms that he's a man of finer tastes
Cool Blue Gatorade is actually orange flavored, seriously try it next to orange gatorade, they're different, but definitely both orange.
And why doesn’t blueberry feature and a prominent candy flavor anyway? Also I would be interested in a grape theory. Maybe it’s taste is just too similar to other fruits? Or they already use is as a sweetener so than many flavors taste like grape so grape can’t actually taste like grape to stick out as a distinct flavor?
0:44 This is revenge for the coffee soup video isn't it?
I liked that artificial "soap taste" candies as a kiddo hahaha
WE HAVE TO HAVE AN OTTER POP LORE THEORY VIDEO!!!
The "Grape" flavor is artificial but it's designed to taste like Concord grapes, not regular table grapes Similar to how the "Banana" flavor is designed to taste like the nearly extinct Gros Michel
0:20, Every Chikn Nuggit fan reconized this.
6:43 To those wondering why there are two Cosmic Coconuts, that’s because there aren’t. The yellow otter is named DJ Topicool.
Well now we know.
Thanks For Showing Us the Blue Pill But now We need the Red one!
Blue.
Next you're going to tell me that bubblegum is just a combination of all the common artificial flavors 🙄
FRICKEN STOP I WAS JUST SAYING THIS THE OTHER DAY TO MY AUNT
Look, MatPat, if you ever address certain items like Kool-Aid or shaved ice by anything other than their color, no one is gonna know what ur talking about.
4:04 “Blueberries are fucking purple” (https://youtu.be/2skYAdEmbRM)
Me, sipping on an Ice Blue Gatorade - "Refreshing. The flavor of this thing is refreshing. That's it. That's all anyone needs to care about."
I knew blue raspberry was just raspberry
I wanna learn the otter pop lore
0:10 the man who made that snow cone was a Romanian
You should do the otter pop lore video, it'd probably be better than this one was.
Matt will give us history lessons with facts and data and then say it’s “just a theory” 😂😂
I thought this was well known.
Tried the mermaid snackpack, 100% would prefer just the basic flavours lol. ( It's just really sweet pudding, no idea what that flavour was )
Can we have a fortnite game theory?
Blueberries are flipping purple!!!
Oh god no what will Percy Jackson do now
Sourness🍋🍋🍋🍋
This is my prier guess to what the actually answer is, because I always thought that blue raspberry (I mean after I learned that blue raspberry wasn't a real thing) was it was a mix of Blueberry and Raspberry
Great episode  Can you continue the rusty lake pls
I'm from Europe and I think red is strawberry, dark red is cherry and pink is raspberry
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hc73pgg5RGU  Just the best story ever about blue in foods.
Those Dragon/Unicorn SnackPacks are UNGODLY Sweet...ive yet to see or try the Mermaid ones though
I'm with Dan, blue is also my favorite flavor
Mmmm my favorite, pan flag snowcone
do oter pop lore
I don't care what it is the flavor is blue
I absolutely loved otter pops as a child and they have always had the characters with them for as long as I remember
MatPat "knows" what licking Ariel is like 😂
Blue
"Now we know what licking Ariel would taste like" 🤨📸
ᵇˡᵘᵉ
LIES!
When I saw this video I yelled at the top of my lungs, I KNEW IT.
All this talk about blue raspberry and grape, did anyone who ever have a banana give their opinion on banana flavored candy
*b l u e*
Pls actually do a otter pop episode I like the idea even though I’ve never heard of it until now
im sorry matpat i hate to say it but i also agree with  head editor Dan here my favorite snow cone flavor is also...blue(blue rasberry to be more prescise)
What about Fish. Fish's are sometimes blue 🐟
Yeah imma need that otter pop lore video
+1 for otter pop lore
I used to always think blue raspberry was a combination of the flavors of blueberries and raspberries
blue is delicious
"Blue"  Dan the editor April 25 2023
Love intro
day 1 of asking matpat to do otter pop lore
Didn't even bring up the red flag my blue eyes are
I've always called it "The Color Blue" When trying to describe that flavor and everyone knows what I mean.
MatPat, I agree to wholeheartedly disagree about grape-flavored anything. The taste and smell of Fake Grape™️ always makes me wanna puke.  I had a really bad fever once as a toddler, and so I was given a dose of grape-flavored Tylenol to try and lower my temperature. I remember my stomach feeling weird, looking down at the tray of my highchair, and suddenly seeing this purple liquid spread across the tray. To this day, I refuse to eat anything Fake Grape™️.
YES! We need an Otter Pop theory!
4:07 Actually, grape flavored candies do taste like grape. Just not _table grapes,_ the kind used for raw eating. They taste like Concord grapes, the kind used for most wines & juices.  They’re not great for eating plain because they aren’t seedless, but they have a very strong flavor. I’m honestly a bit disappointed that y’all would use grapes as an example of candies tasting nothing like the fruit.
Hey, Matpat     I like B  L  U  E     F  L  A  V  O  R too!
I thought that it was implied that "blue raspberry" was a combination of blueberry and raspberry.
3:18 as soon as I said wait blue m&m tastes like chocolate he called me out 😂
i like rubus blue its sweet and was wondering what was blue raspberry because of its bad taste
Blue cocktails aren't "Blue flavour" though. The blue is almost always Blue Curacao, which is orange flavoured. And Blue Curacao is way older than the blue foods trend of the 90s.
I've had unicorn pudding. I'm pretty sure the "pudding" is what comes out of a unicorn's back end
Lotta sussy butts in this comment section 😂
6:58 mental gymnastics to avoid doing Anything covering the Corpse Party Franchise
I don’t care if blue raspberry is a lie, it’s still my favorite 😊
What a video to _not_ be sponsored by the scented drink people. Also, you know what else is _purple?_ Blueberries.
Blue.
Is Blue
I've never really though about it, but now I do I can't think of too many foods or drinks in Sweden that are colored blue. We have blue Powerade and there is a couple of blue candy varieties out there, but at a percentage to how many candy varieties we have in total it's not that many. Occasionally you'll find a cake with blue dyed marzipan on top, but it's not expected to taste like anything other than marzipan, it's just a dye, not any flavor added.
The flavor of blue is delicious 😋
everyone knew blue raspberries dont exist. everyone knows its not an a regular raspberry
Now I am thirsty
bro gets so pressed about blue raspberry
That intro is pretty close to a conversation I had at a sonic while tired after a long day on vacation. Can I get a slushee? Sure what flavor? Blue. What flavor? Blue. Do you mean blue raspberry? Sure, just give me the blue flavor.
Out of all the Theory channels I was expecting to ruin my childhood, Food Theory was not one of them.
I think we absolutely need an otter pop lore theory now
hi
I have never liked blue raspberry to be honest.😅
Blue raspberries mifht not exist but yellow raspberries do and they are delicious
Another example of blue stuff tasting the best is the blue stuff from Heisenberg
“Blueeeeeeeeeee”
BLUE FLAVOR!!!
Well
I like raspberries but very rarely have felt that blue raspberry tasted like raspberries. I love blue raspberry though and it tends to be a sour flavor for some candies and I love sour candy. I am glad others love it as well even if it is a lie.
Gotta shoutout to one of my favourite flavours, blue. Yellow's underrated and so is purple.
i was sad structural color wasn't mentioned when showing the blue morpho butterfly!
The thesis for this theory doesn't make sense for me because in Spanish we just call these flavors "blueberry", none of that "blue raspberry" jazz
Okay but who don’t people just use “blackberry?” Like… its literally a dark blue red berry! Like- its right there!
3:25 Mixed Berry
Otter pop lore gang?
Damnit where’s my YouTube link for I’m Blue
*b l u e*
Blue
I will say that i have had raspberries that taste like blue raspberry flavor, strawberries that taste exactly like the strawberry flavor, cherries that taste exactly like the cherry flavor, and grapes that taste NOTHING like the grape flavor, because that flavor is disgusting 😂.
I’m at a kwik trip right now and ya know what. I really like blue raspberry and am about to go inside and spend money on candy. Thanks.
So, the color blue represents a warning, huh? I gues a lot of people that played Mario Kart 8 knew that already *cough cough* Blue Shell *cough*.
4:31 has matpat started doing the kind of jokes that are hidden in childrens entertainment that are ment for the parents watching with the kids? seriously its like the 4th theory in a row where he made some sus statement like that.
Otter pop theory being good but everyone just wanting to know what Ariel tasts like lol
@FoodTheory On the point about grape flavor: I recently found out that a lot of grape flavored things are based on the flavor of specifically Concord grapes, similar to how the most common banana flavor is based specifically on the Gros Michel. Concords tend to be very seedy, but you can get a cross bread called ThomCords that don't have seeds and are apparently very "grapey"
Blue.
4:33  hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
When did this become breaking theory
Wait till someone tells him why banana flavored candy doesn't taste like actual bananas 🤭 fun fact, it IS banana favor, just a now extinct breed of bananas
In sensible countries, purple=blackcurrant
I still think Red is a better color than Blue
4:33 mat sus 😳  Licking Ariel 😭😭🌚
To think how far people have gone to ban cancer-causing things back then and now you see them all over the place completely fine under the law
I was just drinking a blue Ghost, funny how the timing came up for this!
Setting aside the fact that most fruit flavors aren't made from fruit, I've heard that banana flavor doesn't taste much like bananas because it's based on a variety of banana that is no longer mass produced.  (Big Mike, but all we buy now are Cavendish).  Are there other artificial flavors with a similar story?
The existence of the blue raspberry flavor means the existence of an Un existent fruit many people believe they have eaten
I loved that opening bit blue is indeed one of the best flavors 😆  Also I find really interesting that for both M&M's and sour patch kids added blue to the candy roster I'm just so used to blue being there I never thought that they were added later
blueberries are purple, not blue
Here in 42 minutes
Pretty much every snow cones I've had, had 2 flavors. Red or Blue. That's it. Both tasted bad.
I used to love blue raspberry blow pops. 😃  The kids in my classroom would go crazy whenever someone had them.
Fr i was at the movies and they didnt have cherry which i usually get. Then i remembered they had raspberry. Mind you in my head i know its blue, and ive ordered it enough in my life that i know how it tastes, but i point blank was like "you're raspberry flavor, does it taste...red?"
I feel genuinely sorry for people that enjoy anything raspberry flavoured....it's a deep pain but it's what they signed up for in life
What dat intro
BLOOOOOOO
We don't like non-dessert type foods to be blue, though. Nobody is asking for blue potatoes or blue steak.
I knew it was but it still hurts
Wow!!!!!🫢
I’m literally drinking a blue razz bang while watching this!
Raspberries are my favorite fruit. Blackberries are second.
watch these videos without sounds, more interesting in my opinion
I was not ready for him to say now we know what licking Ariel will taste like
I actually knew all this already!!  Ahead of the curb for once!  But it’s still the best flavor 😂
NO raspberries are blue (I’m collorblind)
One of my favorite comedians had a whole bit about blue foods. It went something like, "Blue isn't a very common color in nature. Name me 1 blue food." And when someone inevitably said "blueberries" he shouted "BLUEBERRIES ARE F***ING PURPLE!"
Blu.
_blue_
Otter pop lore?!?! YES PLEASE
...Blue
OK so if you ever get the chance to try Monstera fruit do it. its kinda close to blue raspberry but more of a fruity punch mix in flavor.
Grape flavor is a specific kind of grape not a week old grape
Oh god please  mattpatt do the otter pop lore video  I didn't know I needed till now...
blue raspberry was and still is one of my favorite flavors, in fact I tent to get more candy and products with this flavor know than when I was a Kid, and knowing the history of it, it just makes me apreciate the flavor more
4:32 matpat horribly out of context
Uhhh, blue raspberries do exist, and they literally have seeds from them, therefore it's not a lie, you can literally plant them in a garden and they grow blue, and are non-toxic to consume, therefore as said, they do exist.
I just recently had a Blue Raspberry / Cherry Slushie, so this is perfect timing. BLUE!  Blueberries are blue, but they taste just like berries.
BLUEBERRIES ARE F*****G PURPLE!
Terrible flashbacks to the late 90's when I was young and always drank blue curacao cocktails when I went barhopping. It's very funny to me that like many other old corny things blue drinks are now trendy again
We NEED! an otter pop theory
I too since a child wondered what lacking Ariel would taste like 😏
blueberry
I LOVE FOOD THEORY HELP
I was literally making a grocery list yesterday and looking for blue raspberries and all that came up were regular raspberries 😭😭
Red and blue are flavors
But seriously who wouldn't want to lick Arial 😏
Blue
i live 18 year and i never heard about something like blue raspberry until today
As randy felt face once said “ BLUE BERRIES ARE F****ING PURPLE”.
B L U
That was funny.  Matpat: What flavor did you get? Dan: Blue.  🤣 I don't know why, but that was just so freaking funny. 😸
What about pink lemonade
In french, whitebark raspberry is framboise bleu, which translate directly to blue raspberry. Soooo...... Maybe?
Artificial grape doesn't taste like grape it tastes like purple.
Matt has just gaslighted blue raspberries out of existence 💀
I thought it was just "Blueberry + raspberry"
Is there seriously a margarita otter pop ?
Itd be cool to do a test by having people taste the captain crunch cereal and say which cereal color taste better while also doing a test with people blindfolded tasting the same thing to see how color affects the taste people feel
Watching this got me thinking, here in Australia we have this flavour called Blue Heaven, a flavouring for milkshakes and toppings. According to wiki it's vanilla and raspberry.
Can't believe people thought blue raspberry were a real thing 😅 lol
Blue
Blue is blue
"Here lies Blue Raspberry, the favorite flavor that was debunked by Food Theory 😢" "Quit telling everyone I'm Dead!😡" "Sometimes I can still hear his voice 😭"
My brain thinks cotton candy when I think blue but that has disappointed me for yrs
Before I actually watch this, here's what I read a while ago. It's not that they wanted to come up with a flavor for blue and choose raspberry, it's actually the opposite. Since there are already so many red fruit flavors, they chose to make raspberry flavored things blue instead to dry it apart from all the other red things. In other words, blue is simply the color chosen for things raspberry flavored sure to there being so many other things that are red.
I love snow cones also 🍧
OwO
"blue raspberry"  Is Blueberry and Rasepberry.... but okay...
Esters from pineapple, banana, and cherry combined with Malic acid. There. I told you! Shut up!
Blue
Do you still drink harris teeter?
i thought for years it was just blueberry and raspberry combined!
I always thought red Gatorade was the main... I love blue, but red flavored drinks are usually better than blue ones. I always thought of blue Gatorade as being the weird secondary flavor to red Gatorade lmao
Next time when someone asks me the flavor of something I'm eating ill just say the color
Matpat: blue is not a flavour dan Dan: blue go prr
I get a notification for this video while drinking a blue raspberry drink. Feeling called out 🗿 waiting for that Otter Pops lore video
As an anosmic we wouldn’t know because we anosmics can’t taste flavour what so ever so we tend to pick our choice by our favourite colour ( most of the time )
grape flavor does taste like grape, just not table grapes. it's just like banana flavor in that people aren't overly familiar with what the artificial flavor is trying to replicate.
blueee         Yo, listen up here's a story About a little guy That lives in a blue world And all day and all night And everything he sees is just blue Like him inside and outside Blue his house With a blue little window And a blue corvette And everything is blue for him And himself and everybody around Cause he ain't got nobody to listen to I'm blue Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di Da ba dee da ba di
Blue
Sad Blueberries noises
Do it
Thank you for making this, I’ve had this argument with multiple people about whether blue raspberry was a real thing
7:18 Meanwhile some juice companies: *Laughs in images of fruit on images of grass and sky*
Blue is the best juice flavor
Was this mentioned in a Food Theory video before or am I experiencing some kind of Mandela effect
Matpat: what is bule flavolr me: blueberry 😈😈😈😈😈😈😈
yes
That's coooooooooool
Great episode mat👏
Please the otter pop theory I need ita
i thought about this yesterday lol
Don't stop here MatPat! There are more blue foods with mysterious flavors. Someone needs to crack the case on what Blue Moon Ice Cream tastes like and why it is only available in certain locations
otter pop lore! otter pop lore!
Never thought I'd watch a youtube video which includes someone yelling about licking Ariel.
I can hear people adding the clip of matpat licking ariel to "matpat out of context" compilations.
The intro is back!
Blue 👍
Manifesting for Matt to make the Otter Pops theory video, Otter Pops fandom where you at
PLEASE DO AN OTTERPOP LORE THEORY
Hi matpat
Me who knew this through my entire life: "americans are so stupid they believe that a flavour exists that isn't even a real fruit"
Blue is the best flavor
blue is in fact the best flavour. you can taste the colour.
I coulda gone the rest of my life respecting MatPat but he just had to throw in right at the end that he likes Grape flavor smh
Blue raspberry taste’s like sonic the fuckin hedgehog
Food theory idea: (this could also be a fil theory) what do the cars in the movie cars eat/drink
I have always thought they tasted like blueberry 🫐
Yeah blue raspberry is just Weird   I always wondered what it was
2:09 I love that song XD
The next theory is how Alexander The Grape caused the events in "Eight Days At Otterpops"
I used to think that blue raspberry was one of two flavors: A) raspberry flavor with a blue color OR B) blueberry flavor mixed with raspberry flavor.     Btw, blueberry is my favorite flavor of lollipop, especially Dum Dums.    Speaking of grape flavor, why can't I find a good grape soda anymore? Every grape soda I've had in the last few decades taste so chemically that I can't stand it.
I’ve picked some grapes from a vine in the wild and they had a very gummy like consistency and tasted exactly like grape candy.
Ready for the otter pop lore
dan became schlatt
Time for someone to grow up in biological engineering to make Blue Raspberries real
I always wanted to know why the fake flavor exists
I always thought it tasted like blueberries and raspberries combined
mat pats got that pan pride snowcone
Is blue raspberry genuinely a taste that existed in the US???
Reminds me of George Carlins bit on "Where's all the blue food?"
Yes do otter pop lore the fursona of frozen food
Raspberry diy blue ?
This man just made me doubt my entire existence because he made a 13 minute video
Blue is the thunder
Now I need teh Banana episode...
Blue is toxic
*duck
Blue
Blue raspberry might not be real but there are yellow ones. They're a mutation of the usual ones and they're actually very tasty, there used to be a bush of them in my grandparents garden.
Is blue
Let’s be honest here, grape flavored anything taste like the color purple ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Curious as to why they didn't go with blueberry as the flavor.
blue is a flavor, also purple xD
Blue raspberry is my favorite flavor in general when it comes to stuff with sugar.
ok, now I need otter pop lore. get on it plz
Grape does taste like grape, like not very like grape but the compound is in grapes... does it really matter that it was originally found in coal-tar?
Here’s a theory why do limes in candies don’t be super sour but the lemons are 🤔
Didn't know it existed until now, but OTTER-POP LORE THEORY!!!
Omg I've been saying this for years!!! BLUE is BLUE!
I may only be 60% into the video, but I'm going to claim victory for my own no-research-involved-hunch that raspberries are blue because there are too many red fruit options
So Blue Raspberry is actually a combination of caramel, grapes, cherries, bananas, and lemons? As long as it tastes good, at least. X3
You've really got to start working on some better content
Ok but I do think grape flavored things taste like grape skin so if you ever have the juice they use for wine making it tastes EXACTLY like a jolly rancher cause it’s very skin forward… skin heavy… sorry cant make that sound good
You didn't already know?
Now we know what she tastes.. like...  Wait what
3:48 he’s gaslighting us! They must be real! Matpat is part of the conspiracy! That’s why he never made a Chanel for conspiracy theories
Did you watch JJ's video on this?
It may be a lie, but it's still the best flavour
da boo dee da boo di
YESS MATPATT LIKES GRAPE FLAVOUR
The long and short of the grape thing is that grape flavor IS grape- but it's wine grapes. They taste different from the ones we usually get in supermarkets. Like artificial banana being the old banana flavor before all those banana trees died (thanks colonialism :\ )
Dan in this intro is just me with my family
Uhm actually... my car is nick named after Blue Raspy Bon Bons, or Raspy for short, so you are saying that my car doesn't exist how rude
Matt: what does blue taste like tell me. Me: umm sweet like a very sweet. I think if I think about it any thing blue seem to be sweet.
4:04 Um…MatPat, while the outer color of blueberries are indeed blue, the inside flesh is actually a more purple color, one that tends to stain if you get it on your clothes
LOL IM BLUE DABA DEE BABA YOU DIE
super  cringy intro
"We know what licking Ariel tastes like"💀
He HAS to do an otter-pop lore episode after this. I would watch that religiously.
Uh hi I’m early and watching a nurtec ad lol
Nah the banana flavor conspiracy 😋
Blue berrys are purple
blue        blue      BLUE
good lord he's at it again
Otterpops lore makes fnaf look bad.
The otter pops point reminds me of one year of band where after the end of the year there was only orange otter pops left in the freezer. And someone said something along the lines of, “guess no one likes orphans.”
Yo, listen up here's a story about a little Matt that lives in a blue world 🎶
you
I always grab the blue raspberry Rockstar energy drink. My life has been a lie.
I guess ypu learned something every day
bro went from clever theories to *out right stuff nearly all* (except the children) *of us know at this point*
Blue. Bluuuueee.
otter pop lore video when?
In colors my favorite one is red
what flavOUR did you get DAN!?
I just always assumed it was blueberry + raspberry
Blue is the best flavour
glad intros are back
Blue
Its blackberry
I always thought it was just raspberry with blue paint in it.
4:09 grape flavored things do taste like grapes. They taste like Concord grapes which are generally what grape jelly is made out of. The grapes at the grocery store are usually wine grapes that have a subtler flavor.
Dan meant "Blue No.2" "mmmmmm carcinogenic"
Nah, head editor Dan just give me Gura explaining her merch energy
Blue is the best flavor every single time.
MatPat can't even leave my Blue Raspberry Slushie memories in peace- another happy childhood memory destroyed 😢
I want to open up a candy store one day and have all the candy be the opposite color of their assorted flavor. Congrats, you chose to shovel a handful of blue pepper taffy into your face hole.
GAME THEORY BRITISH
Now, what's bubblegum flavour supposed to taste like? That has always confused me.
One terrible day, i encountered a blue watermelon candy...
Look into Runts Banana flavor
I see the introductory paragraphs of the video are a mere five minutes long today. Glad to know the all important topic of, "What flavor is Blue?" is so complex it takes 38% of the video just to introduce.
Can confirm, an icee shop near me has Blue flavor icee
Whats is Gregory steal wolf  Blue.
Blue raspberry doesn't taste like raspberry, grape doesn't taste like grape, and banana doesn't taste like banana.
Anyone else think of Markiplier when you so this?
Food theory idea: Why do airheads get shorter when you shake them
Blue
Why do i feel like everyone knew this already
The cold open was priceless  "Blue"
don’t care blue raspberry is still the best
personally Blue Raspberry tastes like cardboard in specific food
Save "The taste of Aerial" for film theory.
Mattpat rockin the pansexual snowcone
blueberry. blue rasberry is bluberry+ rasberry
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS EPISODE!!!
Thanks finally someone addressed this I m not American tho it's just strange why just not call it blackberry
THE FLAVOR.... IS BLUE
You should talk about red 40
“Blue, the color, the flavor, and the dinosaur”
Blue
Okay, but what’s the REAL flavor of the Airheads mystery strips?
I always think for the blue flavor to be tutti frutti as all kind of fruit
yes yes yes, otter pops loooooooooooooore video   please
I think this is facts
Don't mind me, I'm just gonna sip my blue raspberry sparkling water while I watch this
Forget grape, do a video about banana flavor. And the fact many banana flavored treats are based on a banana variety that is no longer cultivated due to a blight.
65446th
I'd like to imagine the intro was thought up by a certain Matrick Patthew strapped to a chair in the dark and dingy basement of an insane asylum who has been rotting away for the past 20 years, babbling out words that happen to string into stories "Blue raspberry.. Not... Real. Blue raspberry not real. Editor get it. Not real. Editor is getting blue raspberry. Blue raspberry NOT REAL. NOT! REAL! NOT REAL! NOT REAL! NOT REAL!"
a long time ago there were 3 red flavors, cherry strawberry and rasberry, cherry was a darker red starwberry was lighter but they were sturggling for what color rasberry is so they made it blue to differentiate and blue rasberry was born,the flavor is rasberry/berry
2:15 you missed the occasion for a blue stop sign (undertale reference)
I have never once thought what a blue raspberry is until now
My head cannon still won't change: 'blue raspberry' will always be 'blue[berry] + raspberry]'. :P
First! @ 6.9K likes, Ha! Nice.
Head editor Dan out here killing the game today
It lurks in the shadows, out of His spotlight, His view. He dances on the stage, weaving a web of lies. But you must venture beyond the cage, and find where It cries. Find the truth.
The sour patch kids ad that I got during this.. sus
.      Blue.
Blueberry’s are sometimes blue but most of the time they are deep purple.
61kth
So many things
I always thought blue raspberry was a blueberry-rasberry mix
Ever since I have heard about CRISPR I have wished someone would make an actual blue raspberry with genetic engineering.
blue flavor is awesome
im blue dabadedabadie ok but really i never tought of this and I now feel stupid.
Blue
Yes! The food theory Theme song is back!
I think this theory ruined my childhood the most 💀
Blue :)
BLUE.
Please for the love of god matt pat never again try to pronounce any slavic name never again. You are so bad that I get a headache just hearing it.😶
Sooo when is Matpat gonna do a diet coke addiction episode? Or is that to close to home.
An otter pops lore episode would be so great
11:51 Helllo from NileRed!
Someone getting fired you had a good run head editor Dan.
You know after this.. Matpat has to do a vid on Castoreum...
Goodness I've lived for 2 decades and this is the first time I ever hear about blue raspberry being a flavour🤣
I always thought it was obvious that Fake-Raspberry flavour is different from Real-Raspberry flavour. Because Fake-Raspberry is delicious and Real-Raspberry is disgusting!
In my country blue candy has always been blueberry.
If you didn't call blue raspberry the "blue flavor" as a kid, I worry for your mental health...
Its ok dan blue is my favorite flavor too
When the imposter is sus
so it's raspberry flavoured  I learned nothing here
“Now we know what licking Ariel tastes like” bro matpat what are you saying💀
Finally the one and only thing I ever wanted to know about food !!!!!! Also has anyone here just ate a vanilla bean for the sake of eating a vanilla bean ?
"Blue is not a colour, blue is a state" (my Ma always says that)
The fact he didn't mention Big Blue A-Treat is a crime.
cool trick for otter pops when frozen just bend them like a glow stick and they'll pop right open. or freeze pops as there known around here.
Matpat. Grape flavor is actually concord grapes specifically. Not your regular "I bought these at the grocery store grapes."
Anyone thinking of that blue drink from Clone High that was literally pancake mix and blue house paint lol
Not just a video about grape but also about banana not being banana flavored too
Bluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuue
Blue.
Otter pop lore? Yes please!
10:50 So this guy just went around taste testing every compound they had in the lab?
ah yes the best flavor in the entire universe...blue
BLUEE
I think "Blue Rasperry" is just short for Blueberry+Rasperry Flavor but overall a very good theory team theory
yo demoman tf2 was americas second greatest inventor????
Anyone else dislike blue raspberry flavor?
Grape flavored thing are the best . Better then any other flavor
Wait who thinks blue raspberry tastes like raspberry? I have never even had a raspberry and know that it doesn’t
Raspberries are red, there are too many reds. Blueberry is not a successful fake flavor, it tastes weird.
I have honestly never heard of blue raspberry, I always thought blue was blueberry 😂
Blue raspberry never did taste like raspberry to me, it was always just a sour citric acid taste with no real identifiable fruit flavor to it. And I was wondering when this one would arise on Food Theory. XD
It was, from what I heard, intended to be blueberry and raspberry flavor but since all the current artificial flavors were made almost 100 years ago, they are out of date. So to those who don’t like banana laughy-taffy, 100 years ago, bananas tasted like that 🤮
I have always wondered about this 😂
Guess what … BLUE
I have  always wondered why blue raspberry is considered a flavor ? And I must say this has answered a few things,  so ... thanks matpat and theorists team 💙
I feel like blue rasberry is an american thing. I have never seen it in Europe. We just have bluebarry.
Blue
I dont care what you say in this video. BLUE RASPBERRY is and ALWAYS will be my favorite flavor. Real or not. Its on planet earth, therefore its real.  Now, on to the video 1:01
blue
3:47 Poór guy, btw I love this episodes editing keep up the good work editors
What I wanna know is why does grape candy and gummies taste like tires instead of grapes
Otter pop theory when
Blue
I’ve been waiting for this my whole life
Did anyone actually think it tasted like raspberry? 😅
I love blue raspberry also sonic was based of the color
Boublegum was mentioned: What flavor is boublegum cause i described a random icecream as boublegum this week
Interesting
5:16 as a huge rasbarry hater who has rasberry bushes in thier gardern i have never tasted blue rasberry drinks or foods so i just expected it to be the same tase as those purplish blue rasberrys
I don’t know if anyone has commented this theory before but, does the shape/ size of the mouth(the water bottles mouth) on a water bottle change the taste of the water/liquid.
A lot of artificial flavors that were developed in the 20s and 30s no longer taste like modern fruit. Selective breeding and extinction events have changed fruit so much in the last 100 years. Banana flavor is a prime example of this. The variant of banana the flavor is based on no longer exist.
If you can’t go to the grocery store and buy “blue raspberries” as a whole fruit, you can assume it’s a made up thing right?
A blueeee theory!
blue raspberry was created when they had too many red flavors but not enough red dye.
I didn't even say it, I only thought "Tastes like chocolate lol" and I STILL got called out, deserved I guess lol
Everyone: Blueberry  Randy: BLUEBERRIES ARE F**KING PURPLE
Now I want blue raspberry everything
Matpat please do otter pop lore I didn’t know they had characters ether
Yay im early
I'm gonna have to nitpick: the blue morpho butterfly does not contain any blue pigment. Like all butterflies its wings are covered in tiny scales. The scales of the blue morpho basically act as tiny prisims, refracting the light that hits them so that it appears blue. So when matpat said that blue is an extremely rare naturally occurring pigment, he was correct, but the wings of the blue morpho butterfly are blue for the same reason that water and the sky appear to be blue.  As I said, I'm nitpicking, but I work in a butterfly museum and am surrounded  by morphos all day and tell people this exact same thing. Hopefully this comment was educational for some people.
I like Sour apple myself
Did you actually just use the Morpho Butterfly, specifically known for being blue from iridescence and not pigmentation, as an example of a rare blue pigmentation?
Blue is always the best flavor, simply makes decisions easy in any food or beverage.
Is it bad if i say "Star Trek" did it first? :( If i remember correctly,since the begining of of Star Trek,i mean the Original Series with captain Kirk, there were different color drink in the show...and there were some blue ones too.
I think ariel would taste salty 😏
In high school, I learned that blue raspberries were not a real thing. And if I thought that traumatic revelation wasn’t enough a month or two ago I learned that raspberries aren’t even a berry! But a banana is! Blue raspberry topics now trigger me forever. The cake is a lie!
i wonder if someone can sinthedicly engenear a blue rasberry that taste like blure rasberry i dont care how fake it it lol
I LOVE OTTER POPS!!!
Blue raspberry: *not being a thing*  Also blue raspberry: *somehow the best flavor of them all*
I've been on a binge of ALL of your videos. I just processed that this video is 30 minutes old 🤣😅💀
I just got Randy Feltface deja vu because BLUEBERRIES ARE FXCKING PURPLE
Blue is the best flavor, change my mind
Otter Pop flavors have fursonas
Matpat should do an episode on why purple is grape in the us but not in the uk
Ever since I was a little kid my mom always told me when I asked about the blue raspberry flavoring she tells me it's not a real flavor it's just red raspberry flavoring with blue food coloring😅🤔
I think we know what next food theory is
Ehemmm "BLUEBERRIES ARE FUCKING PURPLE"
Thanks for ruining my childhood Matt.
blueberry + rasberry = blue rasberry
Huh, I always assumed it was just sour raspberry. Thanks
Yooo is thats where Amouranth got her name from?!? Thats pretty tight lol
My favorite flavor of fruity candy is between sour apple green apple orange strawberry and kiwi and fruit punch
The watermelon candies dont even taste like watermelon. Makes me sick.
In all candies from best to worst is always watermelon,  green apple, cherry,  strawberry, mystery lemon, blue raspberry,  orange then grape
The validation I felt seeing the title is immense and my day is made
Blue flavor is best flavor!
I honestly would’ve assumed that “Blue Raspberry” is a mix of “Blueberry” and “Raspberry”  For obvious reasons
Dan is a mood
*STUNNED!*
otterpop lore... when? when are we getting this? XD
Like This Comment if you want matpat to make a OTTER POP LORE on this channel!!! thats a dab btw
Where i am from we have blue raspberries groning wild (directly translated name from Swedish to English) but yes these do not have the same flavor as things flavored with “blue raspberries” but it is traditionally used in the regions where it grows to make jam of!  The Latin name is different from the one you are talking about but the same family! Rubus caesius When we have candy or other things colored blue in Sweden it’s typically a blueberry flavor (if it’s not imported from the us)  It always used to confuse me why it’s called blue raspberries when they are more similar to blackberries
Okay, MatPat, now you have to extend this concept and try to identify all of the oddly-named flavors of Gatorade 😉
My favorite ice cream mix is casis and raspberry or strawberry
blue
Yeah, you probably could have fit in a lot of the different flavor compositions in this video.  Grape, cherry, strawberry, banana, etc.  Just spend less time yelling about blue raspberry not being a real thing, because I'm pretty sure most of us already knew that.
Grape tastes like wine grapes
MATPAT! You have been summoned!! Chkn nggt has LOOOOOOOORRREEEE https://youtube.com/shorts/e9NB2GMyvmk?feature=share
ariel should taste salty
Isn’t it blueberry raspberry
Cool Blue Gatorade is grapefruit flavor. And my favorite.
Otter pop lore viddeo please
Watching this while eating a bag of Blue Nerd clusters felt very topical.
I always wondered about this. Since here in Denmark, blue is usually associated with cola flavour.
Why are you blue
I have been wondering this since a purple puppet told me blue isn't a natural food color
blue had the most antioxygents
My insomnia has been cured now that I know what blue raspberry actually is
Dan's just sitting there basking in Mat's suffering, only one word escaping his tounge. Blue.
We need an otterpop lore video!
What about pink lemonade?
nobody cares but here within 30mins :)
Blueberries are purple.
I do not care about the rest of the video, purple is not for grape it is for blackcurrant
tell us what bubble gum is supost to taste like!
Theory: Mr mime is an adult man in disguise.
I love this channel an unhealthy amount
claim your before the videos 1 hour anniversary  ticket
Now i want to know Otter pop lore
Blue raspberry should be blue berry
Just call it Blasberry
_blue_
This video touches on the idea, but it's always been crazy to me that our minds just associate these artificial flavors with fruit flavors just because the color matches. It's all marketing tactics 😅
We need that otter pop episode 💯 percent
Fun fact! No animals except for the obrina olivewing butterfly actually produce a real blue pigment. All other blue animals have their own tricks to give the appearance of a blue pigment, like Rayleigh scattering.
That opening just reminds me of Johnny Bravo's excited declaration, "Oo!  A purple flavored one!"
I didn't mean to cause this.
Why they bully editor Dan like that though? 😂
8:09 is that a Latvian flag in the background of the stock image?
Dan got himself "style theorist"-flavor
Me love blue ❤
grape does taste like grape, it's just concord grape
Look, Blue, and Red are indeed the names of the flavors ok? We do it with Orange so just accept it. 💙
My gripe about the episode is that the Butterfly shown when talking about natural blue pigments isn't actually pigmented blue, it is actually due to refraction once again.
The flavor of blue is blue.
if you do flavourings again in the future, may i recommend the history of banana flavour and how it actually tastes of an extinct? rare? no-longer-sold-at-supermarket variety of banana
I share Dan's whole energy
Is it just me, or are the non-game/film topics more like facts rather than theories? lol Regardless, I appreciate the knowledge
Blue Raspberry is also a terrible flavor and should stop spoiling all my sour candy assortments.
blue
As a european, I have always been so confused about blue raspberry flavour. It just doesn't exist here. Our raspberry sweets are usually a medium/darker pink colour than the strawberry flavoured ones haha. Thanks for diving into this!
I've always just loved blue razzberry, because of its distinctive zing, though I like all the flavors except the tart ones like green apple and cherry (even though I love Granny Smiths). (Also, I understand now why MatPat said blue-flavored in one of the recent theories).
Don't even get me started on the blue waffle
Hi
Blue is the best flavor
I know bluer raspberry is a synthetic flavor, I don’t care and I love it
Otterpop lore video when?
matpat got the Romanian or chad flag
5hats a bit dodgy mate.
Blue.
I always thought “blue raspberry” was just a mix of blueberry and raspberry…
I always thought that "blue raspberry" was just a weird name for blackberry flavor. After all, blue-colored sweets are typically named just "blackberry" in my country (if not "blueberry" or "blackcurrant"). Never realized it was such a controversy in English language and has it's own deep lore lol.
Need that otter-pop lore ASAP 🤞
Cool Blue Gatorade is Tropical punch, not fruit punch. I once wondered that and it took me a week to figure it out
Sweet, I now know, thanks!
I’ve never loved the cold open more 😂😂😂
7:02 give them quorters
Matpat have you been to pelicans? Idk if that’s where the intro came from but it’s seriously good snow cones here in SC it may be in NC too
Blue
Blue raspberry is the best flavor but the fakest flavor
dan's choice of "blue" is honestly the best one out of them all
I didn’t know Otter Pops had lore but I can’t wait for the Food Theory on it
Blue Raspberry.... it is Beaver Gland Secretions (Fake Raspberry Flavoring) with Blue Food Coloring... In my opinion.
It’s like when my friends from Texas say the Big Red soda line taste like red 😂
4:05 "UMMM, actually blueberrys are purple.
Blue sour patch kids are my favorite because they taste like Swedish fish but sour
*blue...*
Grape is just purple flavored
I'm hung up on the Humanetee joke...like why did it even happen?
Why no blueberry flavor?
Where I live everybody just calls flavors by the color. People will think you are crazy if you call them by the fruit flavor or whatever
I always thought blue raspberry was banana flavored.
This video was exactly the length I needed to go n°2
dans my favorite
Blue. That’s it. That’s the comment.
Thomas Edison je samo krao od Nikole Tesle, on ništa nije napravio! 🖕😠😠😠😠
Raspberry is one of my favorite flavors, I always thought maybe raspberry wasn't very popular so maybe they made it blue to make it more appealing? Idk
8:13 and in the past people stopped eating tomatoes cause they were dying, turned the plates were made of lead were the reason cause they were putting tomatoes on those plates, history IS kinda repeating itself
Man this makes me miss Pepsi Blue. I wasn't able to get it when they re-released it.
"What flavor did you get?" "... Blu."
I knew I'd eaten a Blue Raspberry (that was more indigo than blue)
Yeah it.. it tastes like blue.
Blue cocktails are almost all pigmented by blue curacao. They are not "blue raspberry" flavoured, more like bitter orange.
does wearing blue clothing reduce your likelihood of animal attack?
Blue is my flavorite ice cream
Blue
yummmmm Blue.
Wanna hear what else is a lie, blue coconut, who here has seen a coconut, that happens to be blue, if so... let me know 👀
i shall just continue to call it "blue" flavor  when dad calls and says they are picking up slushee's on the way home he's like "what do you want?"  and i'm always ".... blue...."  unless they have banana... because idk if anyone knows this but the banana slushee flavor is just.... awesome
4:03 Ain't they be more purple?    "BLUEBERRYS ARE F_ING PURPLE" /ref
Love your content All your vids are amazing 😀
My favorite flavor. *B L U E* Also, clearly it's fake. Raspberries are only red. Blue isn't a natural food color.
MatPat, I will be waiting for that Otter-Pop Lore video, make sure you hurry up and finish it, other wise the next mess with Otter-Pops you will have will be colored Red, and no it isn't Cherry
I've been wondering about Blue Raspberry for years! Thank you for making a video about it.
Funny, I just filled a bowl with ice cream and put some blue raspberry syrup on it, along with strawberry and toffee.
finally, I know what my energy drink tastes like
BLUE MEANS SHARKS IN IT!
I Always Call It BlueBerry Not Blue Raspberry Because I Did not Know what Raspberry Is, I Guess Being Dumb And Lazy To do Research Has Its Own Benefits
you think people calling blue a flavor is annoying.... try working at a fast food place that sells grape flavored powerade and 90% of people just call it purple... D:
I love the flavour blue 💙
I'm convinced it's meant to be blackberry
hi
Pls if there is otterpop law do a vid about it
the amount i ADORE blue flavoring, i needed this for YEARS now, thank you Matpat for solving a little mystery i had for as long i can remember, and resolving an argument between me and a friend
4:04   As randy said   BLUEBERRIES ARE FRICKIN PURPLE
Wait… people see blue as a positive color?! I spent my whole life associating it with sadness and grief 🥲 *Blue attracts me because of my bad mental health. I’m sad, the color is sad… it gets me!*
Now lets talk about the blue bananas from arizona that taste like ice cream.
BLUEBERRYS PURPLE
blue
Good theory mat pat
I work in a cafe that has slush machines, and blue raspberry is definitely the most popular flavour. I had always thought kids liked it the most because it dyes your tounge blue if you drink enough. (spellings intentional and correct in UK)
When I was a kid I just assumed blue raspberry was a combination of blueberry and raspberry flavors.
Hearing Methyl Anthranilate made me happy cuz I remembered the NileRed video on him making grape soda out of latex gloves. Made me feel smart for recognizing the name, haha
you got the matrix reference wrong. the blue pill is the one that allowed him to go back to his normal life and red pill is the truth
I respect you for liking the grape flavor mat
I NEED an otter pop lore theory
Anyone else really hate blue raspberry? What i always do when my friends start making fun of me for it is I say "I'll trade you all my blue raspberry for all your grape" and they tend to shut up pretty quick lmao
Love seeing more Dan in theory videos. Blue is best flavor
blue raspberry is a mixture of raspberry and blueberries.
The matpat community has been pumping out content I sense something’s coming soon
Did...did you NOT know that already, Matthew Patthew? edit: Dan is my favorite editor. because blue.
Great video. I now can ruin everyone's childhood...  Again.
This is the best food theory video yet. I have always wondered about the fanamanan that is blue raspberry. I can relate to the otter pop shpeel
Grape DOES taste like grape, it's just a different type of grape.
I know the pain you feel in the intro
Blue raspberry goes so hard. Mtn. Dew Voltage by far best drink
are people just now finding out
Blue
Hi First Hour Squad 👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻 hope you’re having a good week!  Thanks for the tasty new video MatPat & Friends and go hug your furbabies all 💙🐱💙 (#TeamBlue4Life)
Do the fucking grape episode.
please otter pop lore
when I discovered blue raspberries weren’t real, I thought blue raspberry was blackberry
I eat food
10:45 He was born in Russia, died in Germany. I'm not sure where he spend more time, I didn’t research it that much. Also, I loved this video.
John Oliver showed a tik tok video where you actually snap the otter pop in half. No scissors required.
4:44 I didn't know those existed until 2 weeks ago when my mom got them for my little sister 😂
"is blue" nice Gura reference, sweet and to the point
Anyone in their right mind knows Blue Raspberry isn't a thing... LOL.
dang
Blueberry
The bluwuberry is adorable 🥺🥺
We need an otter pops lore video!!!
Some biologist gotta breed a real blue raspberry
Style theory SUCKS
"Really, can anyone name a blue food out there?  Audience: Blueberry-  BLUEBERRIES ARE F**KIN' PURPLE!"  -Randy Feltface
Matt, I think I speak for all of us when I say we DEMAND the otter pop lore video
watching this makes me happy I don't eat candy
"Grape(candy) doesn't taste like grape." Go have a concord grape.
I always thought blue raspberry was the combination of blueberry and raspberry flavor. Kinda tastes like blue raspberry when put together
Fun experiment! If you let a blue raspberry Jolly Rancher dissolve in Mountain Dew it tastes like Baja Blast!
talk about bananna laffy taffy
Blue Dart frogs are actually only poisonous due to how their body reacts to the natural diet they ingest in the wild. Captive bred ones are safe to handle (although handling frogs is never recommended as you may hurt their skin)
Otter pop lore please!
Grape flavored things honestly just taste like the color purple.
never been this early
yes
AHHHH 19 MINUTES AGO ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
not a fan of blue, but I support Dan
I never thought I would hear the phrase we know what licking Ariel would taste like today 😂
thx
As someone who adores blue raspberry as a flavor but never understood why it is the way it is, thank you for making this. Also, that intro was hilarious. Grape Boys for life, Tom!
I always wondered about this.
I love blue raspberry, but I hate raspberries, so I've always been glad they taste so dissimilar.
I had always thought that blue raspberry was a fusion of blueberry and raspberry and rather then saying berry twice, they combined the name and put the color first to have the name make more sense.
ugh lemons don't contain malic acid that's citric acid... You should have shown an apple "malus"   The editing on these videos needs review.

I love my pet blue poison dart frogs!
YO
In the words of Randy Feltface  "BLUEBERRIES ARE FUCKING PURPLE"
Now I can't stop saying out loud "I am DeGroot!"
So TL;DR blue is good and red is cancer
0:50 Blue.
So I was right all along, Blue Raspberry tastes like capitalism /j
Ive been thinking about this yesterday. Thanks for the answer mat and the crew !
Blue raspy is the best still
I always assumed it was cause when you bake raspberry muffins or smth it turns blue for some reason
Blue is my go to flavor as well so thank you for making this!
Thank you! I’ve been wondering about this for years!
Blue...purple - they look the same to me, but they do taste differently. It either tastes like blue or like Homer said "purple's a fruit"
I think we all know, already.
I NEEDED THIS
Just do all the flavors
Where that style intro
Early
dan is me tho  Also i prefer blue cherry gatorade
Well duh of course blue raspberry isn't real, like bannanas are a berry
0:03 Hey look, it's a snow cone of the colors I identify as. Good old Pan Flag.
Thank you so much for this MatPat your previous video on the colour on gummy bear video helped me to be inspired to do my PhD research on it and so far I am really confident about it, so thank you for inspiring us all to be theorists in our own rights
pretty sure licking ariel would taste like fish and jail since shes 16
Poggers
Aww but you all know we love Blue Razz.
Blue raspberry is the honestly the best fruity flavor of all time.
#OtterpopLoreTheory
So that's why they're sour. Then they're sweet because they still give a nice taste. Then they're gone from oral breakdown, other known as chewing and swallowing.
There are real grapes that taste like the grape candy flavor. I don’t know the name of them, but I had them in South Korea (I’m American). I was visiting a friend in Seoul, and I immediately exclaimed: “it tastes like the candy!!!” He’s also American - and a chef - and confirmed that yes, that grape candy flavor is real.
Blue
Can you please do a 5 second rule video or if it’s not long enough make it a short.
Head editor Dan must be protected at all costs
dan´s "blue" just had me rolling
my favorite flavor is blue, because red just doesn't do it for me
It's even more funny with banana flavor
As I'm watching this I'm getting blue razz berry food ads 🤣🤣
Blue.
Please make an otterpop lore video, it would be ao interesting and would give me an excuse to get the funko pops and tell everyone the knowledge lol
OHMYGATT
my favorite flavor is a lie✨
Oh look the flavor I’m allergic to wonderful  Please tell me what’s in it so I can figure it out
Dude it's been a while since I seen the intro glad it's back😊
so many people in the theory comment sections talk like robots, always commenting the same thing on every video
You need to do an episode on how sustainable is a ramen diet.
Can confirm, having worked a shaved ice stand as a teenager, "blue" was the most popular flavor. Kids didn't get that colors aren't flavors, they just want the blue thing to stick in their mouths.
I never even heard about blue raspberry flavor
I was telling my best friend that I was craving a blue raspberry slushie earlier today 😂
I thought they just rename blackberries into blue raspberries because they kind of look similar Of course I was a child when I came up with this idea so take it with one of those salt lamps
through the latter part of this theory I am sat here like "amaranth.. not amouranth..."
Grape flavoring came from benzene
We must be sour
Day 3 of asking Andrew I. Crocker says "Been asking for awhile, but PLEASE do an episode on Aspartame, the artificial sweetener in all diet sodas, including your favorite. So much shadiness involved in its approval by the FDA"
I'm actually really sad blueberry isn't a common flavour because I love blueberries. They're my favourite American fruit. I have an emotional aversion to neon blue food products because it feels especially unnatural.  tbh I feel like the predominance of blue raspberry stuff in the cultural consciousness is a hangover from the early 2000's X-games "rad" youth culture
Blue
Where my sliver fox favor enjoyers at
before even watching let me just say THANK YOU OH MY GOD IVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS  RASPBERRIES ARENT BLUE AND BLUE RASPBERRY DOESNT EVEN TASTE LIKE RASPBERRIES IT JUST TASTES LIKE BLUE
I'm not from the USA and... tha f****k? I never associated blue with raspberry! Blue is usually pineapple, sometimes cola or sour blackberry.  Im pretty sure the blue gatorade taste like artificial pineapple, qt least in spain.
Sry if this comes of as rude but is the how many T-shirts do you need to stop a bullet video in the works
videos are great and all but why are the intros horrendous
I wish it was blueberry
"Matpat goes insane over popsicle otter brand" (Yes I want that episode)
I mean, the least you could do with Otter Pops is a short where you open them by snapping it in half rather than biting it like the Tik Tok video.
lol
I litterly remember eating blue raspberry on my backyard. Flavorings never matched the taste tho
Hi matpat
Don't say that that's my favorite favorite favorite flavor of sour patch kids!
We would like the otter pops LORE plzzz
Out of all the flavors I would expect someone to reasonably hate, grape isn't one of them.
Blue
I would be interested in an Otter-Pop lore episode on this channel. I LOVE Otter-Pops during the summer time
I want that otter pop lore video matpat!
Oh great, it’s the dream theory all over again 😂
My favorite flavor is red❤
blue and purple are common tastes.
I've always been a green flavor kinda guy, anyway.
My favorite flavor is blue
fun fact the name of the octopus you see at 1:42 is called blue ringed octopus
Technically grape flavor is supposed to emulate the flavor of concord grapes; not table grapes.
Another related idea: See if people can taste different candy flavors without being able to see them.  I can do it with Skittles, but my sisters doubt me.
Blue is my favourite colour really enjoyed this video.
Yes my favorite flavOR. Blue
Gamersupps "Blue" flavor
I love blue Raspberry I don't even care that it's not a real flavor
i was talking about blue raspberry literally just yesterday wth!!!!
Blue stuff obviusly tastes like smurfs
Blue is my favorite flavor 😁😆
Blue Raspberry was always my favorite flavor, and now I know why! But maybe for your next theory, you guys could do something about the banana flavoring in food, since I think it's based off the flavor of an extinct banana
I'm with Dan... It's blue flavored... Blue... Blue...
I like grape flavors, but yes, it doesn't actually taste like grapes, only some things have I found that actually taste like grape. I would LOVE a grape flavor episode!
But why is Blue raspberry the one flavor that almost everyone likes
Hmm, mat describing what he thinks it would be like to "Lick Ariel" is not exactly what I was expecting from this theory but go off I guess😂
What about that artificial cantaloupe???
I always wonder what blue raspberry is, now I know
Worlds favorite color???? Hmm disagree.
blue
Style theory is the biggest fumble in YouTube history
doesn't matter what it's made of, all that matters is blue is the best flavor of anything
Aww yeah, this is the kind of episode I've been waiting for
It just tastes blue- no questions. Just blue
Am I the only one who wishes that there were more banana flavors?
Matt giving the out-of-context fans a lot of ammo in the intro with him distantly weeping while Dan just Whispers the word "blue"
It's funny that he keeps saying that Blue Raspberry isn't real when people have been growing them in Turkey for centuries at this point.
Whatever you do DONT ASK WHAT THE SOUR PATCH KIDS WERE DOING BETWEEN THE YEARS 1935 AND 1945 WORST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE
'Blue Raspberry' always perplexed me since it doesn't exist here (and doesn't really make sense?). Always kind of knew it was just some made up flavor. I only ever heard of it in conjunction with American Candy and the sorts
I've always thought blue raspberry wasn't a real thing until this video confirmed it.
Oh bou here we go again hoping we did not reach blue waffles.....
Mat i beg you make an otterpops lore deepdive
0:20 THE MONOTONE "blue" W/ MAT SCREAMING CRYING WAS PRICELESS!!  Also funny enough, in the uk we have blue raspberry Jolly ranchers but no blueraspberry sour patch kids.  "do I have to do an Otter pops lore teory?" yes
shout out to the 26 people who went that deep underwater to test it
Only 1 person would dear give me the raspberry
Poor blueberry, also I like those cheap positcles.
first 100k
Blueberry’s are *%** purple!
Maybe I'm weird for asking but what is Otterpops?
How did fiesta ready measl sneak onto a food theory episode??!?? Fiesta chicken nugget coy
#FoodTheorySquad
Cool
Sitting here drinking my blue raspberry sour patch kids ghost energy drink! 😁
Blue raspberry is very much a thing. Mountain Dew Voltage is a perfect example. Artificial, sure, but standardized enough to be a a recognizable flavor.
I can’t be the only one who’s known this for years like since I was little right?
Blue absolutely is a flavor. I stand with Dan!
Blue <3
Blue Barry's are purple
B l u e
We need otter pop lore NOW! The next grub hub lore all over again.
I like grape too!
How is this not an airup sponsor?
0:44 he is just saying the truth
I don't care if it's a lie it smacks
Blue
Oh I knew it didn’t exist as a fruit but that doesn’t stop it from being the BEST
I want an otter pops lore theory!!
Otter Pop lore, plz
Blue
No lie, I was just thinking about this a few minutes before this video popped up
So blue raspberry is a real plant, thanks food theory
Now craving sour patch kids
I actually knew that blue raspberry isn't a real flavor! The episode is still really good, though, and I didn't know the rest of it!
Otterpop lore is needed
Man and if he does an otter pop lore before he does a conspiracy theory on Bluey or something like that i’m going to be surprised
Shoutout to the Blue Flavor
matt platt please do more cyberpunk
Blue is blue meth
So, why not Blueberries, yknow, those tiny berries that look like tomatoes or Night shade... wait.
one word to say about this video  blue.
I think a video on the bubblegum flavour would be interesting too considering bubblegum is normally fruit flavoured themselves
Was literally telling me nephew Blue raspberry didn't exist.
I always figured blue was wild berry
GREAT video as always .
If your talking about food obsessions could you do a theory about the mango obsession.🥭🥭🥭🥭
That otter pop line about getting plastic in your mouth was the most relatable thing I’ve seen all week.
I miss my favorite flavor of all Hi-C Ecto Cooler.
If liking blue raspberry is wrong, I don’t wanna be right.
When I tried something with blue raspberry taste I thought - it's just regular raspberry taste?  Or something along those lines.
Artificial flavors are 🤢🤮
11 minutes
I just call it blue flavor.
blueeeeeeee
Random comment here reminding you to do that thing
isn't a blue raspberry just a blackberry?
SOMEONE FINALLY SAID IT
I'm blue daba dee daba daa
I still haven't tested it yet, but I'm like 80% confident that cooking raspberries with baking soda should turn them the appropriate shade of blue, the same way other plants do.
CREATE AMANDA THE ADVENTURER THEORY RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My favorite flavor is bluerasberry

This is exactly what i needed for the day. Keep up the good work matpat and make sure to hit that subscribe button
BLUEBERRIES ARE FREAKING PURPLE!!!!!
dan in the intro made me laugh. post “blue.” In the replies!
this scene at the start is adorable
In my opinion this intro was the best I've ever seen
Blue Gatorade 🤮  Not good in liquid form  Blue powerade was passable in early 2000s
Blue.

Science will find a way to make actual blue raspberrys, somehow someway.
1) grape 🍇 as I hope most of you agree (a large online poll somewhere on YouTube I can’t remember confirmed this by a wide margin) but grape is the worst artificial flavor  2) PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do a video on the grape flavor next or at least soon 3) PLEASE do an otter pops lore video
BLUE

And why he ourple

Am I the only person on the planet that hates this flavor? If artificial had a flavor, that would be it. 🤢
Hhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
I can't be the only one sipping on a blue flavored energy drink right now 🤫
4:02 Blue berrys are purple. Go back to food theory you colour blind youtubeman.
0:38 Plotwist it was blueberry
4:33 matt goes wild about licking ariel lmfao
Blue raspberry just tastes blue
It’s funny that I grew up on Blue Raspberry flavored stuff, only to end up actually finding out Raspberry is my favorite fruit and flavor, and Blue (or Cyan specifically) is my favorite color, tied with Silver.
Quick theory: when people present food nicely like in fancy restaurants do they do that to make the food look more expensive so people don't think it was just a scam or do they do that to make the food look tastier to trick your brain to thinking the food it good?
I don't care if it's fake. Blue raspberry is still my fav flavor
0:31 So this is how u mess with matpat when he force you to read cringy lines
Huh, I thought that was common knowlage?
I want to know the top 10 most unhealthy food additives. I love the nutrition knowledge from this channel.

Blue raspberries were made to feed Style theory employees to mentally control them Matpat. don't try to even cover it up
Blue is the most elite of flavors. If barbie can say pink is a flavor then I say so is blue! We don't know what it really tastes like, but we love it 😄
I love driving my detail oriented friend crazy when I say I got the "blue" flavor.

This is classic matpat

Well, that's interesting. *Grabs the popcorn.*
I loved otter pops! Those were the best
Name me one blue food!
I’m so quick
As someone who used to work summer jobs as a camp counselor where we typically ended the day by giving kids Otter pops, I'm genuinely intrigued by the mention of otter pop lore.
do otter pop theory 😂😂
Literally when I saw the title of the video I cried "thank you."
Blue berries are ####### purple!
Blueberry joy mama 😂
Blue raspberry is actually not even a glavor in Finland. I don't relly understand this but nice video😅.
I have seen relativly few things with blue raspberry around here (east europe), most things raspberry flavoured are pink
Could you do a theory about how fresh home made lemonade can make it easier to sing? I believe it has something to do with the citric acid but I would like to see a theory on it.

I look at title and I know the first part about how blue raspberry are not a real thing

Matt goes mental when something theory related is wrong or unsatisfactory 😂
april fools joke idea for next year: you upload a food theory on game theory, a game theory on style theory, a style theory on film theory, and a film theory on food theory. oh and they all need to be the dumbest theories.
I like licking Ariel 😏
Blue
I don’t know what blue raspberry is. Nor do I know it’s origins. But it truly is my favorite flavor and let’s see how crushed I am by it being some scam from the Sour Patch kids trying to invent a new flavor or something.
This reminds me of that one episode of young sheldon where this guy and his girlfriend start talking about how weird the blue rasberry and blue foods in general are.

4:06 BLUEBERRIES ARE PURPLE, YOU IDIOT!
I always knew blue raspberry was not a real flavor, surprised how many people thought it was an actual thing
blue raspberries do exsist they grow wild in BC canada matt pat is a moron
I have a feeling Dan enjoyed making matpat angry, and fun fact: banana flavor is made to taste like a now extinct species of banana called "big mike"
I remember one time at my work we got blue and red raspberry, and everyone was convinced they were different until I forced then to do a blind test test with raspberry and blue raspberry lemonade and no one was able to differentiate them lol
hehe
Blue is the only way!
OTTER POP LORE!
Matpat could convince me if anything at this point
KALA KHATTA
Actually matpat, it's blueberry

Fun fact here in Brazil blue flavoured things are called "Pedacinho Do Céu" (Patch Of Sky / Heaven) or just "Ice Blue" when it's for frozen treats.

First there sour: They cut off your hair Then they’re sweet: they make a picture out of it 😊
Hi mat
but... its blue flavoured
I LOVE FOOD THEORYYYYYY!!!!!
I love the desperation in MatPats voice at the beginning of the episode. Pure comic perfection
not even 10 minutes in and already almost at 10k views! Great job guys!
Food theory idea!! What is the smell of victory
I love the fact that he just didn’t want to say it😂 grape oh, boy, I just love grape,
BlueBerrys are purple or violet not actually blue
i would like to counter this entire video with blue is a flavour
MP: (aiming gun) FOR THE LAST TIME, THAT IS THE FLAVOR DID YOU GET?!  Dan:                                                    Blue.
Heyy i ve never understood it either
Matpat once again deciding to crush another very major aspect of our childhoods.
was just watchin a bunch of these today nice
Fortnute
Blue is such a good flavor
I've legit always assumed it was a combination of blueberries and raspberries, hence the whole "blue raspberry" flavour 😂
Im so earlyyyy
I wonder how it would taste if they tried to grow actual blue raspberries tbh
nonexistent
Historically, blue paint was the most expensive for artists to use. They either had to cough up the money for it, or get creative with what they could find. If artists used a lot of blue in a painting, it was their way of saying “yeah I’m rich, look at me!” Pretty interesting
BLUEBERRIES ARE  PURPLE MATT
boy oh boy i love snowcones
I have a question would it be genetically possible to make an actual blue raspberry?
please do a video on blue moon ice cream 🙏It could be a good sequel to this
Please play spiritfarer
The first thing I think of when one says blue food is queen Sally and her legendary blue cookies
Blue stop signs
yeah but Blue Raspberry still is the best flavor
"Now we know what licking Ariel would tast like" 💀
Blue
glad this is finally getting covered, blue raspberry has most definitely been the biggest enigma of my life
Yah I actually had a blue raspberry Icee today at lunch. I was actually hoping may pat would make this.
Yes, yes me in the back lol
i ate a blue raspberry jolly rancher while watching
Back in England, we don't have snow cones. It's just ice cream or ice lollies.
Head editor Dan is the best theorist
I was today years old when I found out what flavour is blue is
food theory is what keeps me awake at 2 am
Blue Raspberry is my sister's favorite flavor of a lot of things. She'll be crushed. You've done your job, Matpat! Proudly ruining our childhoods for years
Blue.
💙💙💙💙
Comment
Just because Blue and Pink aren't real flavors doesn't mean I can't love them like they are
My entire childhood is falling apart...
I’ve been wondering about blue raspberry for years now, I’m so glad that Matpat is making a video about this!!
Have a silly day everyone!!
As someone who has always wondered what blue raspberry this was needed
*Me reads the tittle* Yeah no duh, bon appetite
At this point, what does MatPat have to ruin next? Skittles?
Oh
BLUE
I like the flavor of blue. Why do you hate on that flavor?  Also blue baries are not blue, they are purple. same with cabbage.  I love bluebaries, how ever they are all purple. When images on line are the ideal blue, they never are
Regardless its tasty so…
Might be fake. But it's still the best!
Love Food Theoryyyyy!!!!!!!! THX MAAAAAAATTT
Blue raspberry is made out of people!!
Never been this early 🤯 3 minutes ago

Wait for the “We can all agree he never disappoints us with his content” comments
Next: Coke Zero?!?!  🤔🤨🧐  What exactly is it?!?! 🤔🤨🧐

Theory: Is Expired Poison more poisonous or not poisonous
i love the flavour of blue so delicious
make AngryJoe and MatPat holding hands and be upset when they hear the word Blue
Blue is best flavor ngl
Bluuuuue....
Do so little people not know blue raspberry is real that matpat has to directly point it out........?         This is kinda just sad....great video though!
It may not be a real flavour, but anything with the label of blue raspberry flavour heals my soul. I will forever accept it.
leave a like on the video for small matpat after he heard the word blue
Anyone else feel a bit sour about this video? Or maybe a bit blue?
most of the comments dont comment the video, just like this one
Love your video
Blue
But it's true in my heart
Finally, the government conspericay has been revealed.
But Blue Raspberry is the best flavor though
Got here 3min after post
Make a skittles theory (any type of skittle theory)
Matpat never fails to disappoints   Commet if you agree  👇
Blue.
meep
Bet he’s gonna say something about this coming for a beaver
I've wondered for the longest time what blue raspberry actually was
I think you mean blueberry
Legends say they are still trying to ask what flavor Dan got for his snow cone.
just had a ton of sour patch kids today and i see this
They should’ve just named it blueberry and called it a day
It may be fake.. but it will always be my FAVOURITE
Blue is the best flavor, stop ruining it for us 😭
bluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuueh
For the longest time, Red 40 was my favorite flavor.
What? 😨
As someone who hates Blue Raspberry (due to how artificial it is) I agree with the title 100%
I'm finally early
They should genetically engineer a blue raspberry
It still taste bad anyways
This man’s content is legendary. I find it so amazing that he can keep up with 4 channels and make good videos on all of them. We love you Matpat, keep doing what your doing.❤
Blue.
honestly blue kinda slaps
I hope you guys have a nice day
Havent been this early since I was a premie
EARLY
da ba dee?
[Insert "I'm Blue" lyrics here]
I'm really intrested in the origin of crepes, I did a multicultural day and I was given pancakes to be crepes but it had me wondering were does pancake and crepe draw the line?
Forst
I LOVE THE BULLYING OF TOM IN THE COLD OPEN
There is only one living organism that creates the colour blue using a pigment. Its called the olivewing butterfly. Everything makes blue using the physical structure of the cell
Blue is the best
Early!! :)
Finally, somebody says it
Never been this early
GO FOOD THEORISTS
Blue
Good as always!!!
Hey Matpat,I have an idea of a video,A bacon video for food theory,peppy pig for film theory,piggy(roblox) for game theory and style theory? I know you won’t see this but awesome idea for me
It may be FAKE but it is my FAVORITE!
This is totally a thing they had in the office one summer day
good vid
Matpat: "What flavor did u get dan?" Dan cybert: "blue" Matpat: *screams like a baby*
Everyone: explicit and complicated flavor's   Meanwhile  Dan: *blue*
Good to see it's coming to light! Good job Food Theory team! 😁
We all know it’s still the best flavor tho
"Ain't no blue raspberries bro" **crunches a Jolly Rancher** "Look, ain't no blue raspberries here dawg"
the fact its my favorite flavor
Blue
Blue
BRO I LOVE THE TASTE OF  BOUE
DAN MEANS BLUE!  Teams: Blue                bluerasberry 👇🏼                        👇🏼
It's always a good day when matpat uploads a video
It may be a lie but I’m still eating it, it’s delicious
frist
can we get a video about the food mechanics of frostpunk? I was wondering what species would survive the cold.
Lets gooo! 1 minute
Another colors😊s effect our taste😮
Love your videos❤

HI
I hate how food people just decided to cuck raspberries. Shout out to Welch's Fruit Snacks for keeping it real.
Love your videos
DON'T YOU DARE KEEP THIS VIDEO, YOU ALREADY DESTROYED MY CHILDHOOD I WOUN'T LET YOU RUIN THIS.
LETS GOO
I’ve never been this early in my life. Blue Raspberry may be fake but it still solos
I agree with dan on this one
Blue raspberry is my favorite flavor! I haven't watched the video yet lol, early!

Yeah
Good morning good theory
blue

I want to watch this so bad right now but I have stuff I need to do. Wait for me, foodtheorista, for I will be back for you. Wait, so I can enjoy you to the best of my ability. Wait, so I can learn something new! I shall see you shortly, I hope.     Edit: thank you, dearest foodtheorista, for you waited. For now I can enjoy thee. For now I can learn from thee.
Wait can can colors actually be flavors? Just curious cause it's crazy how everyone identifies something tasty off of color at first, like seriously look at the color orange, orange never fails to satisfy
lol
not 1 mil views in 1 minute? kinda fell off...
BLUE
yo
"Blue is not even a natural color for foodstuffs! It occurs very rarely in natu- Name me _one_ blue food!" *"Blueberries!"* "BLUEBERRIES ARE FACKIN' PURPLE!"
