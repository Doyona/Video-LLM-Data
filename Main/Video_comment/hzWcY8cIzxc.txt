so all the chicken scraps are going to china
The answer is knowing both tax numbers for Matthew Carpenter 1991

So if you've ever heard "Bourbon Chicken" from any Chinese buffet in North America, that's what New Orleans chicken tastes like.
11:14
china's kfc is like 10x better than usa's
Why dose he have a perfect British accent
16:04 they are amazing
The US portion sizes baffles me but then again it's America..
Joe saying yes to everything on that China breakfast menu, but just imagine him trying a century egg.
当我到了欧洲 我才快发 原来连锁快餐店的食品是不一样的😂
Actually kfc in the us brought back the Nashville hot chicken i know this because when i went to kfc a week or so ago i saw posters for the Nashville hot chicken
Who would walk into a KFC and buy a pot pie? Me! MEE!!!
As an indian studying in china, kfc in here is borderline trash
US sizes: Individual, Ridiculous.
I ate the pot pie. The KFC pot pie is yummy. Someone bought it for me. I would definitely prefer American KFC. It's worth trying the pot pie at least once.
No wings in the US?! atrocious
KFC China making KFC UK look lazy af
I love the Chinese presenter he dose a really good job and Joe is awsome too leep up to the good work you guys
I love coleslaw lol
No fight. dig the show, but chicken pot pie , my fave!! mac and cheese is better at el poyo loco.
so US can get legs which is 2 on a single chicken but cant get wings, which is mind you only 2 on one chicken. blows my minddd.
Canada, Australia and US fast food chains prices are high due to their minimum wage laws.
spicy chicken leg sandwich 1: any thing else 0
Stop making crispy every thing
This is making want to go to China just to try all those!
What do u expect he doesn’t even have finesse or plus.
2:01 half gallon?!?! What the America
The bowl isn’t the bowl without the popcorn chicken KFC take note!
I had KFD in China. Yes, D.
Bahamas have Barbecue kfc
Chicken Littles are delicious! But yeah, skip the mayo and do that yourself, fast food workers dum af.
china sucks😝😝😝
I had KFC in Netherlands. The chicken i had had grease just falling out. I don't know if it's like that in the US(Live in California) I prefer Jollibee, Church's Chicken or Popeyes.
Churches...bojangles
Here in South Africa we have a 21 Piece Bucket. We have also have 1 piece, 2piece,3piece,4piece,5piece,6piece
I used to get the Pot pies from KFC but now that they got chicken sandwiches there's no reason to get anything other than that imo
That Hong Kong style chicken looked 🔥
Robinson Jeffrey Perez Sarah Hall Donna
The white dude is bragging about the tripled amount tho they got you all obese 😂😂😂😂
KFC in china is not really kfc
O like KFC
China is amazing. I can't wait to move to Shanghai later this year!
i don't know the american but russian kfc is 💩
Do you Hong Kong
Wow who’s the Chinese host in this video? He presented the Chinese style kfc so well!
Could you please explain what ”爽口黑木耳” means? 😊
As a Chinese person, that guy is about as authentic as you can get. Like I can relate to everything he says. 100% real mainland Chinese guy IK im a bit late to the party but that is one very chinese person
Exclusives and Price would be labelled 'Everything' and 'Business' in the chapter titles respectively.
The fact that they got rid of the Nashville hot chicken has upset me severely! This is the first time in the last year that I've had confirmation that it's just gone. I live in a small town in North Georgia, USA and I just thought it was because it was a small town but apparently they got rid of Nashville hot chicken because of COVID. That pisses me off to be honest! I loved that stuff and it was one of the few things that I got along with the $5 bowls. Who else agrees with me??
something tells me chinese kfc has serious cross contamination issues with everything going into 1 fryer
i am sure joe is fed up having to talk about that pie
Wish i was them....😢
I respect KFC for catering to the region they have restaurants. But I can't help the fact that in the US they don't think about the customers at all and what we like. Like the popcorn chicken. Wtf even got beer 😢
Noted kfc china appears to be a knock off kfc trying to sell u bones and pasta rather than actual chicken 🤮
美國=美食荒漠合眾國
Man, that white guy is really annoying.
中国版的KFC后边的预制菜像带货主播一样哈哈哈哈哈哈哈
America has got the best k.f.c. by a mile
The famous bowl is available in Canada as well. And I have seen Keith from the Try Guys eat an entire pot pie from KFC.
the roll is really good if you have not tried it
I need that massive drink container thing from the US! I’d have a 7up one hahaha
are you sure kfc is a usa company?
Finland's KFC is a mockery of the whole brand. We have no same sides or even gravy, even dips are wrong. 😅 When the first location opened a few years ago, some people got sick from the raw chicken.
I know where I will go for breakfast next time I visit Shanghai :)
KFC is said to be better in other countries than in the US.
Umm, that bacon burger was my absolute favorite thing to get at kfc. I also loved getting the rice bowl with the veggies. The take home rice packs were pretty good to. Never did try the pasta ones. But I'd love for that bacon burger to come to the States.  It's soo good 😊
I like the Shanghai-based reviwer. He is very eloquent about the flavors.
Ngl. That half gallon drink bag is very cool. I really want it.
The pot pie is pretty awesome.
What you cant find wings in US?😢
Shouldn’t the Chinese guy have an accent?
"WeLL The Variety In China Amazing🎇🎇🎇🎇 Love KFC Here In The State's 💖💖💖💖BUT Gotta GO With China On THIS One Makes ME Very Hungry 😮😋🍗😮😋🍗😮 GREAT Video 📹📹📹Peace...
Different items is nothing compared to the shock of difference in taste of original recipe fried chicken! Yes, THE fried chicken of KFC. I mean if the menu is down to only one item, that's the only one should stay. The problem is: if the US version is THE original recipe, then Chinese KFC is re-inventing this one. Chinese KFC has wayyyyyyy better original recipe fried chicken than that in the USA. When I first tasted the US original version, I doubted the reality, like which one should be the genuine one? The US version doen't stand a chance compared to Chinese ones.
Maybe KFC Tasted Better in China!
Most London sounding Chinese again ever 😂
As far as I know.. KFC and McDonalds are known for their poor people combo...
I remember going back to China for summer and thinking ‘why is there a whole fridge of stuff that doesn’t feel like it belongs to kfc being sold?’
I laughed hard at 26:06 I cannot stop laughing
China has so much better options in KFC.
I love Joe. He's so funny in these Food Wars videos.
the bowl is also present in Canada and has been for almost a decade.
i appreciate it when joe keeps it real
Popcorn chicken isn't even in famous bowls. It's nuggets now — which I don't find as being as good.
Sxrew the fries — bring back the potato wedges!
Boy, China LOVES The Colonel’s Chicken and they have been innovative!
the coronel sanders on the boba is too cute!!
I feel sorry for US, wings gone from the menu? thats awful, just as bad as when KFC in Australia removed wicked wings from the box meals. should do Australia V US as some stage
Kfc Malaysia, u really need step up the game.
Not having wings or popcorn chicken on the menu in the US is crazy, still have in the UK , I’d be so disappointed
Just love a KFC bucket after a few beers yes not so good on the waist but bloody nice to eat when watching a decent film. Is that not what food is about?
Waiting for China Vs Taiwan since this two countries have difflent menu
33:42 Well when you compare the price between China and US, maybe you should also pay attention to Purchase Power Parity and national income per capita. Although it seems that KFC in China is cheaper, it is much more expensive than other similar food brands selling chicken or other things, and most Chinese can't afford to eat KFC very often.
In polish kfc you got unlimited refill  of your drinks😊
how did you invite colonel sanders to reviewing the product itself?
I also have kfc in Malaysia now the price is more expensive for 1 basket
The famous bowl exists in the Philippines.
China get wise quick. KFC keeps trying to buy the Great Wall
Nothing tastes worse than recycled fried chicken from the night before. One KFC in Brampton stuck the Chicken leftovers in the deep fryer for a 2nd kick at the can. Result: Really deep fried batter with no contents The meat was eroded away. LOL Bradford KFC just threw the night before leftovers into the warming tray. Gag City. The same nationality of people seem to be taking over the KFC franchises. This sort of thing never seemed to happen before.  Head Office could care less. I think KFC is in major decline. I’m done with them!
That china kfc menu is like 4 times the menu in canada wtf
The price difference is insane.
Why doesn't he have a Chinese accent?  British 🤔
0:15 what did he say?🏴‍☠
Pot pie a day fries are the best things on the menu
Why does the Chinese guy sound more American than the American
For a chinese his english is so good. Love the accent.
one piece!?!?
We have that side bowl in Canada and it SLAPS!
KFC gets extra crispy by breading it twice. They dunk the chicken in water, bread it and repeat.
The questions is. Are those real chicken?
popcorn chicken actually isn't in the famous bowls, it's the nuggets instead
Glad they could get Colonel Sanders himself on the video.
There is a british guy talking over this Chinese man
Yo it's 12 am here about to sleep now i am hungry. Please send the extra chicken here hahaa
no need war.we want peace.💗
America doesn't have the variety because Americans are very closed minded when it comes to anything "different".
that whole chicken from chinese kfc is so delicious
7:30 did I just heard dude saying “If you want a burger just go to Mc Donald and get a burger king” ?!? 😂
Best kfc in thailand
difference is probably dog meat vs chicken
Chinese KFC menu is insane, you'd think KFC was going bust in the US with these comparisons
byd居然有人不喜欢老北京鸡肉卷
OK, I'm just goin to say I want the Chinese extras more.  MMMMMmmm  ... Bring on those goodies!
American KFC got Chicken only but China KFC Can get fried dog and cat.. that is Insain
Can get kfc but can’t use the internet without a vpn… rekt.
China should just rename KFC to WTF at this point
😍 makes me want to go to China to try their kfc compared to our usa kfc
aint no way yall didnt buy the chinese guy the buckets and you just put picutres stg if I see that humiliaton again i will be mad
Fuk KFC I only ate Nashville hot.
F chainese and china 🇨🇳  go 2 hill😊
Grilled chicken at KFC was my favorite but they took it away in Utah
Please guys do Pakistan kfc vs America kfc
The Chinese KFC is amazing, those flavor omg….. I wish Japanese KFC can develop a bit more😭😭
China get maaaad choice
I want the famous bowl
Both really great hosts. Love the juxtaposition of accents.
0:15 THE ONE PIECE
The crispy chicken sandwich in China is actually crispier than the one in the states or Canada.
0:24 the... the....
We have the Famous Bowl here in Jamaica as well
This is the first video I've seen from this series and holy hell I am absolutely smitten with Tianran. He's an amazing host and the way he describes food and reacts to them is absolutely wonderful.
No wonder obesity is an American thing,and American food sucks
It's cool to see so many options but if I go to KFC, I'm getting fried chicken and that's it. Maybe some fries or mash with it but everything else is unecessary.
My most ordered from KFC is the egg-tart, can't order KFC without it everytime.
I swear every time I watch one of these videos it feels like every fast food chain in every other country has not only more options, but better options than we have here in the US where they started 😂
Myself and my mom both get the pot pie and it's really good. It's for those moments when everyone else wants fried chicken but you're not in the mood, so you opt for the pot pie lol
How come on the KFC china version doesn't have it's actual language on it
HEAR ME OUT - THE CHINESE KFC HAS BETTER PRESENTATION AND PACKAGING
Its gross no matter where you buy it.
😂😂 i am from Germany, not all we have here, like in America. But is really interesting. Thank you Guys for sharing. Btw both of you are very Symphatic 😊❤
Wheres the kentucky fried canine 😅
Can you guys do usa vs the caribbean!!!
Somethin about getting a burger at KFC made me puke
2:29-2:50 *What?!....WTF?!*
is this hongkong or china?
0:15 one peice
Here's everything  you'll find in a kfc in china that you won't find in USA 🐈 🐕    💀
Grose!
Need yaal to do a jamaica vs us for this, it gets even wilder scratch that, china be doing too much
one menu item u cant find in the use but u can find in the china are fried dogs
This just made Hungry Bangali even hungrier.
We still have whole wings we just don’t sale hot wings anymore mad about the popcorn chicken still❤
KFC USA❤❤❤❤
America wtf
In Arizona I would Texas Church’s chicken is the bigger competition with KFC. Our Hispanic community tends to prefer church’s over kfc which is usually pretty bland in comparison
SWEET WHAT...12:02
Grilled chicken is nasty. Go fried!!!
Great to see you guys
中国的KFC有疯狂星期四，美国没有😂😂😂
china kfc - 🐱🐶🐭
2:31 the dj rep got me 😅
Bruh speaks better than natives :D
the chicken little is not exclusive to the US. We have it in the UK under a different name, the mini fillet burger.  EDIT: Minus the pickles, thats odd.
ARAB n INDO have the best KFC
a bit out of topic but tianren should do an ebook voice actor his voice is amazing
I have to say KFC is the most popular western fast food in China of all time，mcdonald and burger king have no match with KFC here😂
Eadies instead of McDonald’s
???? 香港style ?
Mana ikan bilisnye
TRY KFC INDONESIA
有时候中国的KFC给你一种中餐厅的感觉，他们为了本土化付出了很多，而且很成功。
The one piece is real?
In KSA we have 21 piece bucket ✌
Eggs tart ❤
KFC in China is better
Scapula is your shoulder blade. Collar bone is your clavicle 🤣
Can KFC NZ change their fries box because it blows.
KFC egg tarts it's my favorite.
21:22  at this moment my clash of clans village got raided and 3 starred :(
Luckily the american KFC doesn't contain lead and the skins of dead uyghurs.   That being said china does give away free winnie the pooh dolls with every meal though.......so thats a bonus.
China KFC is 10000 times better than US KFC no doubt
After 5 yrs living in US and now I am in China, I have to say that the only thing I miss about American kfc is the pot pie
Wouldn’t wna know what’s in that Chinese kfc meat🤢🤢
Cartman snorts chicken 😅
9 delicacy juice taste almost exactly the same as HI-C orange blast, the one you always get at Wawa. Definitely my favorite growing up. 😋
KFC in the US is hot trash it has fallen off so hard it's disgusting. Popeyes demolishes KFC it isn't even a contest.
nuggets replaced the popcorn chicken and taste drastically diffferent, the nuggets aren't bad but they are not the popcorn chicken they used to have which tasted amazing
The price comparison is a bit misleading since it has more factors for example economics levels and international exchange rates. To be more precise, it would be better that if the price can match with some sort of index which can partially indicates the level of consumptions at both country. A suggestion can be the median of individuals' income of the countries or areas.
Try US vs HK KFC next time
I remember my mom's friend ordering KFC and us saving the chicken bones for the doggo to nom on. Alongside his usual helping of rice in water
cfc? china fried childr-
Joe start talking about Tiananmen Square
honestly, breakfast here in the States sucks
Burgerking next
…we still have wings I had them like 4 months ago lol
Tianran is a fake Chinese 'cause he doesn't like century eggs! 😂
I genuinely thought I was gonna see Joe have his take or something at KFC for selling BEEF and FISH
Useless...cause china doesn't have yt to watch only
ranch is doing good in the US because nobody else wants that crap
"If you want a burger, go to mcdonalds or burger king" - A wise man
KFC pot pies are the best thing on their menu imo
in Poland portions are mainly 3,5,8 but it varies from what you really want, fe you can just add 2 wings to the bucket of six
Both shit😂
What about kitkat flavours Japan vs Uk vs America😅
new orleans chicken wings are the best wings ever lol i always order some whenever i travel to china. :)
Joe's "extra crispy crunch" took me straight to Brooklyn 99 and Ramero's reaction to Jake's ramen tip 😂
When I studied abroad in Beijing, KFC was our go-to after a night of clubbing
I don’t know why but I am watching this 3 days in on a water fast 😂🤤
As a Chinese person I always order the chicken pot pie when they have it here in Canada =/ it is my favorite thing
I love this chinese guy for explaining localized things so well and figuring out the concepts of products! Cause there's always so much name-wraping in chinese fastfood marketing. I as chinese nodded a lot in my head while watching. Joe's also great and so funny!
KFC need to stop adding chemicals and artificial fillers …
*WE LOVE KFC!!*  <3 <3
Now i understand why people in the US are obese. They literally have double the portion size in these foodwars compared to orher countries
Did KFC really get rid of chicken popcorn too? Wtf? I never eat fast food why is everything I love dying?!
I was not surprised that much that china has more exclusive kfc than usa because china can eat any living thing
West: Chinese people cannot innovate!  China: go to our KFC!
zingerrrrrrrr wings forever
In China there’s another KFC called Kungfu Fried Chicken 😂
Try Indonesian KFC, thank me later!
Compared to China and US KFC menus, the Hong Kong one is *boring*. We don't even have the "Hong Kong-style crispy baked chicken thigh" here. My favorite side, coleslaw, recently returned but the dressing tastes different. In sum, I am underwhelmed.
KFC in China they have palatable options suck as: Tree Fungus, Banboo Sticks, Congee, Fried Dough Sticks, and Peking Chicken Wraps
Why does he look like a Chinese nick eh 30
Can we get an aerial cam to see the food better?
Too long. I’m sick of chicken now.
Scapula is a shoulder blade hahahahahaha
Der Unterschied ist dass man in den USA auch wirklich Fleisch bekommt wenn man bei KFC bestellt!!!
oo thats what winnie the pooh can never eat in a chinese disneyland
KFC in China is more expensive even than USA.
Chinese KFC = No Oil US KFC = Oil Bucket
Not a big fan
if i was the chinese man or the american man i would be tired of givin speeches about the food and eat it instead
The way the Chinese KFC absolutely decimated the US lmao
This brand is selling "Halal poison" to China directly from Malacca.
Dirty Communist China
Spilling ice cream reaction got me lol
It really bugs me when i see food i want to buy from other countries.
i work at an australian KFC so it's interesting to see all the different types of KFC. still believe ours is on top though. quality here is like no other.
I love the chicken pot pies!!
Your Mom Needs The KFC At Home
this is the first time ive ever seen someone look so chinese with native level english, sure i can still hear a bit of an accent but way better than the uni guys from china that came to advertise their uni to my international school
American sizes be like: Big, Bigger, and Biggest 🤣
The Chinese man's voice is so calmimg wtf
So if you go into KFC is the service so slow that you have to take your sleeping bag or pitch a tent in the drive through while you wait for your kfc as it is here in Whanganui New Zealand ! 😂  Oh and sorry we've run out of chicken.. can I interest you in a bun !
One of the most friendly China US comparison videos. Let's stop hate each other and eat junk food together
I'd honestly get the pizzas lol
As a Chinese person who migrated to Australia. KFC China really makes me regret my decision lol.  KFC Australia is so lazy....
Onepiece is real
1:59 what on earth?? First time I've ever seen that
they got rid of the nuggets???!!!
2 things the USA people thought would never go away.. MALLS and Chicken Wings
can you compare your kfc and McDonald's food with Russia?
9:46   So he's wrong because he pointed towards his collarbone which in a scientific way is called "clavicle"  but scapula is shoulder blade
Please do not eat any of the products seen in this video
my gid china is killing it
NOOOO the popcorn chicken and wings are gone from USA
Trinidad and Tobago having 21 piece bucket: Pathetic
Kentucky fried chicken VS kentucky fried cat
As an Australian, Chinese KFC has us on ropes when it comes to product variety. So much to choose from.
Potential counters for new Food Wars: (in my opinion) Australia Canada Mexico Brazil South Korea Türkiye Ukraine
seeing all this amazing food reminds me why im working so hard to become rich ill be able to eat more lol
How can a Chinese guy speak with an English accent. So weird.
That Chinese KFC guy is actually video AI with an English overdub
I’m one of the people who loves the chicken pot pie and orders it every time I go to kfc lol
They got an English Chinese person to did this so people wouldn’t make fun of “fries” being “flies” , “large” “rarge” … etc
You'd think KFC originated in China with all the exclusive items they have. How is it they have tons more than the US?
Man you obviously from the south. Ao Ao means amazing
KFC is such crap in the US now.  But apparently its better everywhere else.
you should ask how's the KFC in Tiananmen Square
i see this is why 41.9% of Americans are obese...
Neee, in Nederland hebben we 36 bucket nog groter dan American
Usa is fatty food with high calories and will probably give you a heart attack
So incredibly tired of seeing this guys face make those stupid exaggerated expressions. Not watching anymore of your videos that have this guy in the thumbnails. He's not funny, he's annoying, his vocal pattern is like nails on a chalkboard and he has zero creative input.
The corn and portuguese egg tart were the best items, no cap
In some Asian countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines KFC is served with rice, weirdly enough Hong Kong serves rice in its KFC outlets. I wonder why China doesnt do so
笑死我了 嗷嗷大鸡架哈哈哈哈哈 应该是东北那边加在形容词前面的一个词吧？😂嗷嗷大，嗷嗷香，嗷嗷厉害
Fun Fact : Lees Famous Chicken a smaller Chicken Fast Food Chain big in the Southern part of America was Created by Colonel Sanders ( KFC Founder) Nephew
Have to say that the KFC coffee is better than Starbucks in China.
I love this show
Im cracking up at pot pier's. "I've never seen someone order it, who eats it." I would love that in the UK.
The New Orleans chicken wings in KFC is actually based off of something from Orleans in France. It has nothing to do with New Orleans in the USA. There is a chinese documentary about the rise of KFC in China which includes many of their earliest inventions.
Scapula is the shoulder blade. Clavicle is the collar bone buddy
The EGG tarts are the new bombs for KFC. Should totally be sold worldwide
nice watch mr. china guy :3
Having tried both KFC in America/Canada as well as China.. I have to say China's KFC is superior by far.
Kfc in china and hong kong kills ones in usa original that shrimp tempura kfc style is off the chain !! Its why asians eat kfc on holidays i use to live in Guangdong
It's very brave of the Chinese guy to do this show, considering that he will most likely be placed in a forced labour camp when he returns to China, for promoting American culture.
you guys hired a robot from china
I wish colanal sanders should stick to just chicken and chicken burgers
Is this a repeat? I remember Joe drinking out of that ridiculous IV bag of soda . Also watching this makes me so angry at all they took away! They had the best potato wedges with this insane seasoning on them and same with the popcorn chicken. Both have changed drastically and for the worse :,( Also I’d so much rather have more mayo than less!
Korean style chicken is the best
Chinese chicken should be investigated to see if it is real chicken.
Interesting to see Joe not be the main guy in these videos as China has so many options
USA: Chicken China: Labrador retriever Extra COVID
Kfc in spain is shit
KFC SOOO SOLTY omg
Audio is too quiet
Save the neck for me Clark😅
So pot pie is American version of British meat pie.
The popcorn chicken at 10:00 looks very different to what KFC popcorn chicken looks like here in Australia where it’s more like miniature bite sized nuggets of chicken with batter.
remember when KFC had  "Laptops" back when every calculator looked like a flip phone and every educational toy was like a laptop...  but the KFC laptop came with popcorn chicken, mashed potatoes, and then like a fruit rollup and a bag of baked cheetos.. i think it also came with a applesauce or a chewy gronola bar.. a lot of prepackaged crap
God bless america 🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
The KFC buckets in China actually update quite often, and new flavors every season. But honestly I still prefer the original chicken every time
haiyaaaa
My favorite thing at KFC is also the chicken pot pie!
My husband and I always order the pot pies 😂
❤❤
omg the wrapped corn on the cob just unlocked a memory for me!
I honestly knew that the big boxes were pizza boxes from tha beginning
Is China KFC making their super soft ice cream a KFlurry?
Scapula is your shoulder blade, not your collar bone (clavicle)
KFC in China used to have also a Mexican chicken roll or wrap, it was the best!
American portions are too big.
Depending on where in the US you go the Sweet tea will straight up give you diabetes. Ask for a small water.
United States KFC: We do chicken right  Vs.   CHINA KFC: we do k9's Right.
I'll suck some toes for that Bao. Congrats on your exclusivity.
You should find someone to check the KFC in Colombia, South America. Not only the chicken is usually bigger and juicer but the bucket options go insanely big as well 😂
we also have famous bowl here in the Philippines, it’s so good
I just love these episodes with Tianren! Can't  wait  for  the  next one! Good  job  here 🎉🎉🎉
bro do kfc india v pakistan
As someone from the UK. I've always wanted KFC to bring the Pot Pie to the UK. We love our pies in the UK. How is it not here already?!?!?!   Also, those famous bowls looks amazing. I'd order 7. C'mon, UK KFC. Step up your game. Your menu has been the same for decades. It's boring now.
Can u do Australia vs USA food wars series one day
me and three other people are out there keeping the pot pie alive
Food Was World Cup team are USA British India Japan China
After 2 minutes I got bored
KFC in any other country I've been to always makes USA KFC look terrible.  They got rid of the chicken sandwich with the pickles in the US? That sucks I liked it better than the Popeyes chicken sandwich.  Also, it's $50 for a family bucket meal now??? That's outrageous smh
My girl likes potpie actually.    🤓☝️
I wonder if any Chinese KFCs have buffets like some US ones
They have a saying that the "family bucket" does not mean that you should share it with ur family, it just means that the chicken has their whole family in the bucket😂
This probably doesn't matter but the scapula are the shoulder blades not the collar bone which is the clavicle
why dose KFC have so much stuff for the Chinese market, we damn near get 15 items and china kfc has better stories to go along with the food
USA all the way but that's just my opinion which doesn't mean anything.
Scapula is shoulder blade, not collar bone fyi
YaooooOooooooo so excited to see this
I can’t believe you don’t have dunked wings 😭 best thing ever on the kfc menu
man i thought the Australian KFC was plain we have more then USA some how in chicken burgers
What happened to the sound, when joe eat the pie?
China's OFC is more famous than KFC.
There is a huge chicken sandwich offered at KFC in the US, not sure why you went with the. snacker
KFC is pretty serious overseas. In America they are exclusively known for slimy, chewy chicken.
Makes me want to visit KFC. It’s upsetting that their quality went down over the year
Before coming to US my biggest wish was to travel to New Orleans and taste the authentic New Orleans wings. Sadly then I found out there’s no such thing in New Orleans
How the hell does a KFC survive with having so many options
This dude is more English then the english😂 he is great 😊
Family bucket is meaningless in China. Just 3 members per family
i think it might have been more informative if you added weight + price comparison (also price per KG),.
肯德基的嫩牛五方是最最好吃的😍
Fried Chicken preventing WWIII like
KFCCP.
I like Tianjin I’m starting to Learn Chinese myself
Those chinese fries are fake because I definitely know and remember they use french fries in china instead of the thick ones.
Is there Slim Chickens over in America as well? Going in a couple of weeks and it's in the UK and it's supposedly from Texas and it's absolutely to die for 🤙
Wow I can't believe how extensive the chinese KFC  menu is . Amazing ,we have a very basic menu in Australia 🦘
I had KFC in Beijing and can say it is far superior to KFC in the UK. KFC in the US just looks like too much.
Why does the Chinese guy sound like a British man? Oh yeah cause he from the UK.
Why does KFC china have Beef burgers in Kentucky fried chicken for a reason not Kentucky fried beef.
There should be a us vs Australia food wars
9:46 scapular isn’t collarbone, it’s the bone that the wings are connected to. The collarbone is called the clavicle.
Gotta understand that the *People’s Republic of China* is *KFC’s largest market,* not the United States.
Do you know what was the most shocking thing is when I went to America, their fast food quality was actual dog shit. We went all around 6 different states and every single time it seems like it was worse than what we got compared to like Europe, UK, Australia or even overall Asia. Big portions but garbage quality most of the time. I feel sorry for you Americans with your burnt KFCs, Soggy mc donalds, hell even burger king is so bad over there, they don't even touch it, compared to other countries that have Burger king or Hungry jacks (australia). What was good though was your chic fil a, five guys, wendys, popeyes and.. YOUR STEET MEXICAN FOOD IS A GODSEND. Cheap and the portions are crazy but so delicious.  Edit: Not to mention the amazing cooks that was there, I remember one "Josephina" (Hope I spelt that right).. My god that mature lady could cook the most amazing street meals that were cheap, she taught me how to normally eat a taco and what sauces would mix well with a burrito and the amazing chilaquiles.. Legit making me want to marry a traditional mexican woman, I'd be in paradise
They just needed to know one thing and that is the US kfc tastes like oily starch without flavour and disgusting  How do I know? Isn’t it obvious?
egg tart da best
The newest version of US KFC's nuggets should be called nuglets instead.  So tiny. :(
Seems old KFC China has beef, Fish, Pizza etc lol. We have none of that in AUstralia.
as an english-speaking mexican i find very funny the idea of an asian man with brittish acent. also, mexican kentucy chicken is smaller and i might say more expensive.
Hey guys I think you can also do the food wars US VS Indonesia because there is a a lot exclusive items that you don’t get in the US 😃
Spicey is not the same as hot
LoL china kfc make like so nobody get obese unlike the us It all big portion of fat
Insider Food good video, i was wondering could you please do US VS Australia KFC Food wars down the track?
Focus on the food. Not the face. Missed some exclusive Chinese foods
KFC be screwing the US customers...cant even get beer at KFC here
3:44 Exactly
Who wins between KFC USA vs China
KFC should have just kept the potato wedges and not got rid of them
1:19 This
Super delicious KFC ❤
why was this the best video so far somehow lmaooo
2:05 HA😂
This made my day    ( dammmmmym hope you share  that Joe) 🤣😂
Tbh red rooster is better the kfc ( Aus). Sad tho we don’t really do Mac and cheese here.
We call pot pies ( chicken pies in Aus , and pastes.  We call sausage rolls there so good .  Minces, onions. Backed into pastry sheets and cut into squares and dip them into tomato sauce ( ketchup)
Nearly 9000 KFC locations in China is hectic!
中国KFC越来越像大众食堂了
Why call them chicken carcasses? Sounds like chicken road kill.
kfc in the us doesn't taste good as Popeyes does, I miss KFC in China.
Kentucky Fried Covid 😷
Day 43 of asking for Australia
not ofc?
The white background is absolutely horrible.
in australia our driks they give us either a can or a 1.25L bottle
I've lived in China for almost 4 years now and basically KFC (and other well known western fast food) just sell everything they can that's considered 'western food'. the KFC near me sells curry haha
The pot pie is THE BEST menu item!! But, the infuriating part is they cook only so many at a time so either they’re out of them or just put some in the oven so you have to wait 20-30 minutes. And you would get a free cookie. I guess that’s no longer true since you said the cookie has been discontinued. What is with these chicken places effing up by discontinuing the best items?! Grrr!!!
As a Chinese now living in the US, I have to say, when I first moved to the States, the moment I found out "New Orleans Chicken" is actually fake, I feel so cheated by KFC 😢 Childhood favorite of all time 😢
chip wars woops too soon？
the chinese guy speaks good english.
In Canada you never know what you're going to get from KFC... ordered 12 pieces in a bucket when visiting Montreal and the bucket was half full, as the chicken pieces were tiny. Ordered the same 12 pieces in Toronto and the pieces filled the same size bucket, but I got food poisoning... guessing the chicken was frozen for 6 months or the place was just filthy, (never ordered KFC ever again!)
It's me lol. I'm people who get the pot pie. The KFC near me burns the fries and might under cook the chicken.
What no wicked wings 🫨
no subtitles? :c
wow
I'm confused we have as asian man who no sound Chinese.   he sounds more like he from England or Canada than china.
I thought lattes were pronounced "lah-te".
This just shows how bad America is with fast food
I was in Beijing in 2016 and I tried the KFC and I was so excited because it looked just like an American spot very “hood” and the cashier look at me with a sassy attitude 😂😂😂 it was so cute and I thought he hated me because the wings were so small but now I get it! 😂😂 but wings were just small in general 😂😂😂 it was a good time! Also because everyone one watched me eat!
secret theory: KFC is popular in china was because colonel Sanders looks like Trotsky  yeah I know they liked Stalin more, but once for a while you do meme about this for a good fun
For anyone unfamiliar: Chinese marketing loves to put locations on food item names so they sound more appealing. I remember being there during a time when "California beef noodles" and "California beef steak" were all the rage: so many noodle joints claimed to sell "California" style beef noodles, and so many snacks had "California" beef steak flavors, because as anyone from California will tell you, we're famous for our beef noodles, right? 😆
Back in 2010 when I worked in China, they had a Mexican wrap that was really good. They discontinued it though. The Old Beijing was also a favourite of mine.
KFC's pot pies are Amazing. One of there Best items
White guy so obnoxious
FYI, the ''nine-fruit juice' tastes almost exactly the same as the tropical juice that can be found in most grocery stores in the UK. It was a classic KFC item in China.
KFC is the popular fast food restaurant in China. They love KFC.
Welp...I'm moving to China lol
China, why is your new propaganda plan just to shit on American KFC in an absurdly obvious way? This one was pretty sad guys, let me know if you need any help it seems like you kinda need it.  -Mr. Weeb420
General Tso chicken is from Taiwan.
The first thing I see after the video is finished, a ad for KFC. 😂  Google: he just watched a 36 Minute video about KFC maybe he is interested🤔
I am eating shit in Canada.
Aw man that big chicken thigh looks incredible 9:00
I can't be the only one who notices the Chinese guy has a British accent
Chinese KFC is probably made of Uyghurs harvested organs.
Yo Joe!
The Chinese guy has such a posh British accent. Much love from the UK 🇬🇧
kfc is my first job and ive been working there for a few months, but yeah the beverage bucket fillup is a pain. Idk we still have cookies I take home everyday, strawberry lemonade we had a month ago, wings idk? we sell them in our buckets with a breast leg wing thigh? but yeah we only have original or extra crispy and got rid of grilled.
its wild that china has better KFC options
Clavicles are collar bones! Scapulae are your angel wing bones, the part of your shoulder assembly that connects your humerus to your clavicle.
surprised to see no cat or dog nuggets on the KFC china menu
wish we got biscuits. and nicer chips
The UK needs chinese style KFC it looks so good
I miss the KFC in China, I haven’t gone back in many years but I still think about it 😂😂 I’m glad I get to see some more China KFC food vicariously through this video!! (My favourite thing was that spicy fried chicken wing, wonder if it still tastes just as good!)
US vs China food wars is the saddest for the US in the series by far.
This is why Americans are obese. If the Chinese aren't careful they will join their American counterparts and find themselves with high cholesterol and hear problems and high blood pressure. Kidney and liver problems ingesting deep fried foods.
In China, its cats
The US guy looks like Colonel Sanders himself 😂
Funny thing is the portion size of the US KFC has gone down since the Pandemic.  last time i got chicken at KFC i was like WTH I ordered Chicken legs not Pheasant Legs.
Can someone explain to me what in the blue hell you actually do with the biscuit? We don't get those in the UK and I can't fathom why the hell you'd have what appears to be a scone with your KFC
Would not trust that china food
KFC in the US is absolute garbage, and it has been going consistently downhill for the last 10 years.
oh my god, when i lived in china, i'd get the dragon twister ALL THE TIME. it was so good and i miss it dearly!
Not me, who only orders the pot pie at KFC lol
I would have loved to see US vs France KFC. You'd be surprised how their KFC is actually very compared to us.
Why would anyone want to order a chicken carcass
Man the chinese dude went on a rampage while american Joe was like I have .... cake.🤣🤣
Chinese also eat chicken feet?? Interesting 😅 thought its SA 🇿🇦thing
Well done China for utilising all the edible bits of the chicken.
America Wins 💪🏽🇺🇸
I'm fairly certain the budweiser and bucket of chicken meal is inspired by Korean chimeag. If KFC in China ever did a similar soy garlic seasoning, it'd be on point.
US used to be very dine in centric too, I remember a time where you'd see whole families dine in and now your avg kfc is empty and maybe got a homeless dude in the corner.
Those are sandwiches, not burgers.
Who in the world calls bread a biscuit?! You don't have biscuits with your kfc lol
KFC's China breakfest menu looks amazing
I wish with we have Thai KFC, Korean KFC, Chinese KFC, etc…vs American KFC….the sides are much more better and healthier.
The China correspondent is awesome. Best of the rest by far, only Joe is better.
The One Piece is real!
In china they use gutter oil
Don't bother with KFC Germany, it has the most basic menu of any fast food chain and it's also trash.
Daaang that kfc in china very good tho
Great series, thanks for sharing!
If only all Wars could be this delicious only.
Famous Bowl is definitely available outside of the US but I particularly hate it.  It's sold here in Singapore but holy crap is it often soggy that it just tastes like cardboard. No thanks.
South Africa🇿🇦 has a 21 pice bucket chicken and an impressive menu Better than the US 💯👌
When i visiting China , I ever saw KFC releasing a limited time product , The KFC Stuffed Crab
when my girlfriend moved to the UK alls she ever did was complain and say how Chinese KFC was so much better than the KFC worldwide, she is dead right lmaooooo
Another great comparison, which is what the video is all about. Sad to see  in the comments the ignorance about China, and the continued bat / corona comments.
American kfc collection is just sad
Living in Japan with super limited menu makes me can’t stop thinking how could the video of KFC goes such long.
US is a communist country now
i was watching with my mum and she legit got so mad about china having so much non chicken items saying "THIS IS SUPPOSED TO KFC WHAT IS ALL THIS CHINESE SHIT" very sad and brutal world
We still have popcorn chicken you can get on it’s own in uk.
No more, please.
Pot pie is the only thing I'll eat from KFC 🥰🤤
yssssssss❤
Finally you guys made video about KFC between China and US. Now I would love to see you guys make video about Pizza Hut between China and US.
This Chinese guys sounds British .. get someone without a British accent more fun like the previous episodes
"Spa", if the reason for the name is true, is stupid. Seriously.
Seems crazy that you can’t get popcorn chicken on its own in the US anymore
Please can you do a South African VS.......🇿🇦🙏
Scapular is not the collar bone. Scapular is your wing bones
This Chinese guy speaks perfect British English... I was expecting a heavy Chinese accent 😊
Damn this is just a war against KFC lmao so many criticism towards them haha
This chinese guy is doing his job very well 👍🏼 but i wish he sounded more chinese then British 😂
In Indonesian KFC, you can buy a CD in KFC along with your meals. I remember seeing KFC ads promoting up and coming bands to some big name artist on TV in 2010s. But I don't know how popular it is today, though they are still selling it.
The famous bowl is a go-to menu item here in the Philippines. It's available in szechuan and italian style flavors.
KFC is THE #1 restaurant chain in China. In the US KFC is somewhere 8 to 10th most popular chicken. Unless you’re in rural or smaller cities or states in the US. But they don’t have the flavor of the other chains. China KFC does too many things, which means nothing is done well. If I want chicken I order from Korean chicken restaurants in China. I stopped going to KFC in China because they would never have the mashed potatoes, nor the side salad, which was more cabbage than lettuce with half a slice of tomato. They have a Thursday special you can get a lot of chicken cheap, I just haven’t tried or wanted it. Again, sauced chicken from a Korean spot is better than bland KFC, especially if they only have fries or corn. Globalization means they change the menu and flavors to fit the region, so most times I’m disappointed eating at “western” restaurants in China. The fried chicken at McDonalds is as good as chicken at KFC. Fried chicken at a Thailand McDonalds is better than most fried chicken I’ve had anywhere.
Okay hear me out though… just try the pot pie. I don’t even like pot pie normally but that stuff is good.
that what's u call dripping? yall NEED to eat Malaysian ramly burger. yall KNOW dripping after that
Will Burger King be the next?
Please, give China opponents better camera. Oof, that zoom at  4:15
I wonder if KFC China is big around Christmastime like in Japan.
The ice cream one got me! 🤣
Beef burgers at kfc is so wrong.😮
The pot pie is amazing.
KFC China is on another level. I still crave their chicken sandwiches and Chizza
Where's the bat from kfc china?
I'm from malaysia i can say that our kfc menu is less than china and less than US for sure but malaysia have nasi lemak kfc and thai recipe kfc but in limited time. But i love black pepper kfc which is so spicy i love to eat it.
Popeyes >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> KFC
The scapula refers to one of the bones on the chicken's back/chest. The clavicle, or wishbone would be equivalent to the human collarbones.  Great video, btw! 😋
There pot pie is actually okay. I like the pastry a lot. Wish it was on the bottom and sides too.
Just go to Arby’s. I really like anything from there. Got me craving Buffalo ranch chicken sliders. Reminds me of the spicy Buffalo zinger from KFC of yesteryears edit: For sandwiches.
I get the Pot Pie every time. Guilty as charged. It's actually pretty decent.
Why are all the American fast food restaurants so much better in other countries than they are _in America?_
Don´t forget that they have a Dessert Corner, where they serve special items, which they switch up every season. Mcdonald's has one as well! Their seasonal drinks are unbelievably good! Oh, the Red Bean Pie is always sold out in Wuhan. The last time I visited family there in 2019, I couldn´t get it anywhere in Hankou. It is one of their best-sold products.
This video would've helped me a lot last month as I was in China for work. Unfortunately I found out that the Chinese KFC stopped using picture menus so I had to resort to trying to tell the cashier what I wanted by pointing to pictures from the KFC China website on my phone. I can vouch that the K-pizza is quite good, and I would get it again.
KFC still has normal size chicken wings in original and extra crispy they just got rid of the little "wings" that are usually sold at restaurants.
it sux how sum places have big or small pieces,, or both
The American guy reminds me of JonTron lol
australian kfc = 🐐
This series is going to bring about geopolitical peace
KFC pot pie stan reporting in. I feel like you have to like pot pies in general, but if you like pot pies, KFC's legit goes hard.
I think that KFC in China has a better menu than the USA
Finger licking good
KFC ❤
Bojangles in the US.  Not sure if it's national, but it's great.
Never tried the potpie tbh from kfc
China: Hmmmmm KFC (Kentucky Fried "Chicken") let's sell BEEF burgers.
I buy the pot pie it's banging.
Your price comparison seems rather useless these days. I know Joe is in LA so the "US" price is gonna be on the high side, but I'm sure tons of viewers have no idea where he is. And I have no idea where the chinese guy is in china. I know he prices vary wildly across the states, so i imagine the same is in china, so yea should state where they are and do some effort to find an average or example lowest price too.
Hell yeah ❤.
I see China doesn't have the biscuit, they vanished here in Hong Kong, too😢
2:06. marks a moment of true chemistry.  they do listen sometimes!
yes
The one I’ve been waiting for!
Pot pie is delicious! 😋
I’m sure that the reason why China’s KFC sells pasta as a way to compete with Jollibee. It would make sense, after all since they’re both chicken shops.
Thin and flaccid is never good
Wait wings are gone?!?! It's been awhile for me. haha
Everytime I go to KFC it's only for the pot pie it is amazing and once you start eating it it's not very big because it's mostly crust the reason you've never seen anyone you know order the pot pie is because only sexy people eat it
Getting beef or fish at a KFC is borderline sacrilege
I got up and got a pickle spear after Joe ditched his.  More for us Joe... More for us.
Joe, I eat the pot pie and I get it pretty regularly. It's delicious and filling and you should try it.
Bring back wedges.
Huh! Weird. I lived in Shanghai from the 2000s to 2010ish, and I was looking forward to seeing the portugese egg tarts here! Wonder what they did to them.
I miss the KFC buffet. 😢 Also, don't diss on the coleslaw. I personally like their sweeter coleslaw.
Forsen
Honestly, food wars after all these years is pissing me off. Like they should have a mini fridge with a freezer to maintain the integrity of drinks and cold foods. And an air fryer to reheat certain foods properly before consumption. Like come on.
Oh this is the video I'm looking for. I missed the China KFC so so much, here in Canada every time you purchased a KFC meal is a surprise. Because sometimes it tastes so bad and sometimes good😅😅you'll never know.
Forgot about the american fried liver and gizzards
at this point, the KFC and its culture are basically Chinese now. The KFC franchise speaks more in china than they do in the United States.
onepiece  nice
Im now convinced men that dont like pickles probably have a micro penis 😂😂😂
Bro when I was living in China, KFC was probably my favorite fast food restaurant
🙋🏻‍♀️ KFC POTPIE
Bruh why do u eat absolutely every piece of each animal in China 😂
Tianran,why the hell is Hong Kong style?Is it similar to flava crava chicken that we have?
How do some fast food joints outside the USA get beer but us.
Bojangels and cat shit Church's are better than. Kfc
What name for Chinese guy
The hot wings  wings still exist on the menu people they just got rid of all the saucesI still get them but the ghost pepper wings are a little bit better from Popeyes
Joe clearly read the comments of the previous video, his energy levels have increased and I'm here for it.
International kfcs are always on another level. As an Indian that's now in Canada, this joint stinks in comparison. Although the relative purchas-abililty is wayy higher due to relative income
Up until 2016, the Chinese couldn't have more than one child by law.  So it makes since that they don't have a family size yet.
Chinese KFC is Disgusting 🤮 I’ve been living here 6 years but it’s horrible the taste is soooooo bad
I love KFC's kitchen pot pie 🥰
Bruh, what the hell? We're totally getting ripped off in the US.
The Pot Pie is the best thing on KFC's menu (in the U.S.), hands down. It is way better than it has any reason to be and is the only thing I get from KFC these days as there are so many better Fried Chicken places to choose from. The only other place to get a Pot Pie, that I've been able to find, is from Boston Market. It's also good but I like KFC's better. If you've been sleeping on the Pot Pie, it's time to wake up. After seeing him try it, I'm sad to share the name Joe with this man.  On a side note, I think KFC should introduce the KFC Krunchy Box-o-Beaks.
BEEF, KFC??
I usually prefer Lee’s fried chicken, but this is making me want KFC now.
America continues to stay doing the least
KFC in China is just so much better than anywhere else. I love the popcorn chicken there.
mmm KFC! we need more of the chinese guy his english is better than mine and i'm british 😂
isnt all the food cold when you eat it?
the famous bowl is here in jamaica as well.
Miss the India VS 😂 , please bring back India again
Usually joe isn’t that excited about the other countries food 😂
Would like to see USA vs UAE
You should create food menu comparisons of KFC vs Popeyes.
Carcass has a very negative connotation in English usually. I think of a dead body that’s been sitting out decomposing for a while.
China really does not mess around with their menu options it's like "here's what the American menu has" "here's what the Chinese menu has" 12...hours...later
Famous bowl is in Jamaica
What is the difference in wages? US is only $7.25 in many places (or $2.13+ tips w minimum payout of $7.25). What is wage in China (city).   Would love to see the CN menu here!
I'm in Louisville Kentucky and would pick kfc over most. now give me a good bojangles and forget about it
I have eaten KFC in China and the original recipe tastes 100% better than in the US
April??!
Who goes to KFC for beef burgers? 🧐🧐🧐
Don’t ask me how I know this but the famous bowls just use nuggets now. It sucks. The nuggets suck.
Damn 37 minutes lol damn
Why do other countries have such cooler packages than us
KFC China has enough items to become a grocery store.
Kfc in china is the best
The Chinese cruller got to Indonesia and got called cakue ❤ As far as I know, all 90s kids love that stuff. We'd get them from street vendors around schools, served with spicy peanut sauce and kecap manis. Betawi/Jakarta style congee usually have it as toppings, although it's already sliced thin 😅
My wife introduced me to KFC China a few years back. Bought two Dragon Twisters back for the plane ride back, I miss it so much. They literally just made a big Peking Duck wrap but replaced the duck with KFC chicken😋
if i had to eat kfc, would probably go with chinese option
Such a great video! I love these two guys and I’m always so excited so see what china has to offer at those restaurant chains! I’m totally in love with red beans 💜 What makes me wonder is that Chinese people can eat milk. Call me ignorant but I thought most of people from these areas are having a lactose intolerance
The what? @17:56
I like the pot pie my self but they need to do something with the baskets they're a lot dryer and harder  then they used to be
Years ago we had the famous bowl😭
Food wars the Communist addition.
I've had KFC China and KFC USA. KFC USA sucks in comparison to KFC China in terms of offerings and overall quality. In China, KFC needs to come out with a line of new products every month to get returning customers, as regular KFC customers typically return only for new/recurring seasonal items.  The food at KFC China is also always fresh and hot and more diverse. In the USA, you never know what you'll get.🔥🔥
The Chinese drink cups looked photoshopped, no?
China kfc is lit 🔥
I can’t speak for Chinese, KFC, but US and UK KFC doesn’t taste of anything. Some of the items on the Chinese menu actually sound like someone made an effort which is quite interesting.
There is one you forgot about in the US Joe - Bojangles
19:52 You just did. 💀
No wonder why they cal US the obese capital
kfc cole shaw is too sweet but churchs cole shaw is just right
I want see season Russian Food Wars like new Russian McDonalds vs American McDonalds (And in Russian food wars before old sizes and exclusive and new sizes and exclusive)
ive never seen chicken feet fried 😭 its already hard enough to eat when its braised
i’ve been watching food wars since it started so i’m more than excited that you guys are doing china! i’ll be moving there very soon and know nothing about my food options (especially being vegetarian) so this is very very useful!!
Next time I will try pot pie🤣
the size of our drinks always makes me laugh
I don't know why but it feels like the  Chinese guy is just reading a script while talking no improvisation no jokes nothing just plain talking
Face it - anytime you're comparing 'Murica and China food-wise, the U.S. loses big time. China just cares much more about food and has ~4000 years of culinary history.  Any country whose signature dish is hamburgers just doesn't care.
The famous bowl is available in Canada as well. And I have seen Keith from the Try Guys eat an entire pot pie from KFC.
Wtf is fried chicken carcass?
The fries suck, bring back the potato wedges!
US KFC is a pathetic shell of its former self. No innovation, variety, imagination, risks or anything fun whatsoever. China is so creative and willing to do different things. Boooooooooooooo US KFC.  BTW - this Chinese guy is a rock star! Eloquently spoken and easy to understand. Very funny too!  Advice: Give the hosts a proper intro.
Why does the Chinese guy have a London accent even he doesn't want to live in China
Lmao china is sorry AF
I have spent time with many Chinese groups. I was surprised how eating time was functional, rather than social. That was with the exception, as mentioned in the video. Chinese people went out of their way to be social when eating at KFC. To the extent of it almost being a party 😁
Love these vids, for some reason they’re just so interesting and I don’t really even eat fast food much. I just love seeing the comparison between countries
This is the episode I was looking forward the most cuz Chinese KFC has a lot of original and crazy stuff😂
good video
The wars began again!!
I was expecting a fired bat burger
Yessssssss I LOVE THIS SERIES 🎉
New Orleans wings the classic! It blows my mind that it isn't available in the U.S.🤣
My Chinese aunt claims kfc has the best egg tarts (and she’s in Beijing). It’s because they bake them fresh for you.
KFC used to have BBQ , which was the day before's extra crispy cooked in BBQ sauce.
who here likes mash potato??
Filmed two months ago?! 😆 I love you guys!! Why couldn't we have the rest of the boys join in? 😭
Mary here you are correct I have never met you I order the pot pie that needs more chicken MO.
The Chinese co-host (sorry, I haven't caught the name) has a lovely voice.
26:15 hahahahahahah
Even Chinese options of KFC look tempting and delicious
Chinese? This guy sounds British! BTW KFC is the fastest way to get diarrhea!
The chicken probably comes from China.
live in NYC for 5 years, we have all kinds of REAL Chinese food here, so the first meal if I went back to China would be KFC china
In South Africa, we have the 9, 15, 21-piece Bucket.
I do have one question for you guys that I am wondering about: There is so much food and no statement from your side in the video nor in the description whether you throw stuff away or give all of it to the crew and just people? What is your take here as Joe threw something away in the AMC/Odeon Video? Would be a shame if you guys threw food away... Off Topic: Awesome video as always, love the China-Harry :D
I love the famous bowls haha
I still can't get over the fact that how other countries (China) are just more advance when it comes to food than the US it's insane It just looks much better. So much healthier We need to adapt to other countries. I think if the US did that I think we would be a much healthier country. Tianran It's such an amazing Co-host. He describes everything so perfectly. Also Joe you're on fire with this one🔥🔥🔥
Fun fact: KFC was the first Western fast food restaurant to open in China
Wow China 🇨🇳 vs usa 🇺🇸 KFC.
KFC in Jamaica has Famous bowl too
Why did KFC took out the chocolate cookies 🍪 and also the rest
Need a Korean vs usa and South Africa vs usa
The pot pie combo was my standard order way back when.  I still like them.
Amazing accent!!
I’m so excited, I love Chinese kfc!
u know how much kfc loves a country just by looking at how much effort they put into the menu.
I believe that I have to Go with China on this 1.
This explains why Americans are overall unhealthy.
this guy changed my chinese stereotype real good
New Orleans grilled chicken burger is my fav!!!!! I miss that so much, always among one of my first things to eat when going back to China
I like the look of those bowls from America, would definitely try them
KFC is dying in USA but growthing anywhere else.
I still haven't forgiven KFC for discontinuing the biscuits in England
I really miss the potato wedges, anyway always entertaining to see food Wars China Edition.
A highly anticipated episode as kfc China has been so adopted to Chinese palate!
Wings/popcorn chicken 🐔 still available in Canada 🇨🇦.
KFC in China still has corn on the cobb but got rid of it in the US is upsetting
im sorry but i would riot if kfc removed popcorn chicken. like that is 1/3rd of the reason to even go to kfc besides original receipe and mashed potatoes......
goddam that 64oz bag of pure high fructose corn syrup and type 2 diabetes.....im sorry but why dont they have that in other countries?they need to bring that shyt to Singapore asap......im buying that and hanging it around my neck like a colostomy bag and sucking from it all day.
People here spreading love from their country: I'm in. Much love from Germany guys! 😊
imagine naming a menu item "carcass" lmao sounds like you found it on the side of the road
KFC!!!!!
kfc got rid of wings, Nashville hot, and popcorn chicken? man its literally just frozen stuff and a sauce.
As far as cooking fast food at home.  I buy frozen PF Changs because we don’t have PF Changs where I live.
Hey Joe stop reading my comment and give me a reply already.
Tianran again! Nice
A Chinese speaking British eating American food what a combo!
Just an FYI, the scapula is the shoulder blade not the collar bone. Great video, though! I'm loving the new season. :)
That chinese guy is super boring
I bet that the Chinese KFC is much higher quality
Do China have bat fries with corona flavour at their KFC ?? 😂😂😂
Nice👍👍😎
I will never understand how KFC could be so good outside of the US, while in continental US, they're utterly garbage. Heck, I think my uncle who went to the US to visit his daughters there earlier in this year, mentioned that the locals he had a chat with in NYC considers it as a sort of...cheap food joint, like... In a sense, it's like a dollar menu in terms of quality.
Bros English is better and more articulate than mine
Chiken *explodes*.
Y’all know this is going to be good!!
These videos are so boring. Just tell me the food. I don’t care about the weight, dimensions etc
I watched my first one of these videos yesterday. And I fell in love with it! Before I knew it, hours had passed because I had watched so many more of these vids.😂
They really eat every part of the animal in China
KFC is amazing, no matter where it’s from.
US portion sizes are actually terrifying
I’ll be honest im only watching this for China lol
Compare it with UAE KFC
If you do a comparison video including South Korea get Ben deen on!
2 videos in one day? Joy!!
pls do US vs kuwait kfc
Please  do 🍩  next pls?
We need US vs China White Castle! It'd be a great episode (yes China has one!)
I like Tianran (I'm sorry if I'm not spelling that right) - I'd love to see him do more of these with Joe, and then episodes with Harry, Nikhil, and George.
hmmm chicken........................................................................................
Do US vs Jamaica KFC
KFC potato wedges were the company's greatest loss to their menu in my opinion.  I wish KFC would bring potato wedges back. 1st btw !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hope Taco Bell is in China so we get China vs. US Taco Bell.
Chinese sell KFC in the name of  OFC 😂😂😂😂
Here’s everything in a Chinese KFC you won’t find in a German McDonalds
Still not convinced that's not Harry :)
never been this early 😭😭
beer is good
omg hypeeeeeeee
Woohooo a new Food Wars episode 👌🏻👍🏻
Y’all already know we here sending those daily positive vibes from Houston everyone!🙏🏼
US VS INDONESIA PLS
China and their KFC
maybe first
tenth
Awesome job joe
Innit

Finally the fast food restaurant I was waiting for 😍
I love these videos! ❤
Ayyooo 1st
