Half my ass is gone😂
the iceberg was the original one hit wonder - made a big splash but doesn't want to repeat the hits over and over
There was a third dude the entire time 🤣
No. They didn’t drowned. They froze to death because there was ice in the water that night.
Bowen yang is amazing
This is hilarious
he needs to be pluto🤣🤣
"What was going through your head... "
OMG how much do I love you Bowen, brilliant
Hilarious.  ICEBERG,  funny, he don't look Jewish!
I'm not here to talk about sinking, I'm here to talk about Singing. :D
This wouldve been funnier if he had done it like a straight guy...Stefan was better!!!
Ingenious.
This is hilarious!😂
"What was going through my head that night?...   A 🤬'N SHIP!"
He was just chilling.
"Only 20 or 30 people died"..."Uhh it was 1500"😅😅😅
WHITEFACE!!
🏳️‍🌈Every detail is perfection. Yang said this was the turning point in his career. My favorite tidbit: Little Miss Iceberg drops the death toll from 40-50 to 20-30, while Jost maintains 1,500.  I feel sorry for the 14 souls Jost DIDN’T include.🏳️‍🌈
One of the all time best sketches of SNL
this is still one of the funniest things I've ever seen on SNL; it lives RENT FREE in my head!
Nice hst.
Well you have to think - if you kill yourself - you’re still guilty of killing someone called.. yourself.
Love loverboy.
Well if iceberg had an album - if it’s like $15 I’d get it.
I had an early lunch, but.... 😆
An Asian man wearing iceface. How racist can you get, SNL? 🤦
This is Everything!!!😂😂😂
I went to iTunes.  No album…where can I buy his fantasia?
They don’t see because you’re iceberg
Best skit on SNL ever!!!
Every single  F-cking ( pardon my poor French) this makes Mr GIGGLE AND GIGGLE. WHY MAY I ASK, DOES THE MAGNIFICENT ICEBERG VEED TO EXPLAIN A BLOODY THING, AS IF ❤❤❤❤
3:44
It’s - Poseidon.
It was really hard to type that because they’re really funny 😂
Let’s um… do our Poseidon jokes
Imagine Austin and I doing the Coldplay meme. 😂😂😂😂🤣
I know what he/she means.
So if you’re threatening court - okay.
Any good judge would know that.
Do you notice how camila Morrone always claims matters of irrelevancy? No?
“The white albinos”
I know what to do.
I felt that way when camila Morrone tried to think she’s empowered to be a firefighter. There are a lot of people in the area.
I saw Brent tonight - he’s awesome and really nice but it’s like. Can we hold up on our promises?
You’re on top of the trends, iceberg.
Bowen Yang is the best 😂💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛💛😘
I would get it if it’s like $15
That is one of the funniest comedy routines EVER!!!
This is the most random, brilliant thing ever!
Top 10 skits in SNL history.
I would get it if it were like $15 I’d totally dance to lover boy at the club.
Wow.
damn..this is so good ❤❤
Blame JP MORGAN. The Iceberg was innocent.
He plays a millennial so well.Now its behind the scenes with the BBC.
"Half my @$$ is gone"🤣
jeez i had my speed on x0.75, i was laughing the whole time still, i thought his slow talking speed was part of his comedic personality…. 😂
“Yeah it’s called MUsiC 😆 “
And he sings better than Jojo Siwa.
Funny.
1:17 how did they predict the playboi carti album
The water.  What did the autopsy say? iceberged?? No! They drowned b$$@😂
Exactly.
Good thing I got rid of Greg r which I’m sure Bowen knows about - and zero pizza.
That’s right.
I watch this about once a month. So good.
“You wanna do this? Then let’s DO THIS!!!” 😂😂😂😂😂
The laughter is relentlessly stupid.
“Oh my god, they’re gonna make the movie about this.”   PUT THIS ON A T-SHIRT!
1:34
the wahHTTEEERRRRRRRRR?!!!
the sinking of the Titanic wasn't a tragedy it was a lesson.
Absolutely hilarious he always performs the he'll out of all the characters he is given!!!!! Total fan
hilarious!
I wonder if in 100 years we'll personify the plane that hit the north tower
Sorry I don’t find the deaths of 1500 souls funny.
Nobody's canceling the water?? Honey BP and Halliburton gotcho back 💜
Someone diduhhhh
😊  never gets old
It's really a weird time for me...💀
He should have won an Emmy for this. No one remembers who won who went up against him.
I thought it was going to be scraping and crunching sounds, like a ship hitting an iceberg 😂
They missed such an obvious joke at the beginning. “What was going through your head that fateful night?” Bowen, “The Titanic!”
Certain people you should not believe in.
If I were rose - I’m probably too cold to talk because I’m f*cking freezing.
Well the Jasons - so one Jason is really Republican and the other Jason works with Linda - we refer to them as the jasons
Is iceberg having post partum?
"I hate that 20 or 30 people d**d or whatever" lol I watch this all the time lol
"its a hyperpop EDM new disco fantasia, called Music" LOL
You base music off of your heartbeat?
What would I say to iceberg? Um in the audience I’d ask “you look gorgeous and is that what gave you the skill to set trends?” Madonna is like that.
Exactly.
3:48 Iceberg: „This is my new single. I think you’ll like it. It’s called Lover Boy”  Colin: “Oh God.”
"WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING ME? YOU SAID YOU'D BE MY OPRA, COLIN!"
Of course the iceberg is gay! 😂
"Hey, wait, Starline, you built a bad boat. It didn't work out. That's on you, honey!"  😂
I have abnormal periods now.
It can be really painful.
It can be really devastating and I never wanna go through that again.
What if you need one?
The Narcissist we all Deserve.
Iceberg say: the Atlantic Ocean isn’t the f*cking autobahn.
And I’m a dancer I live on music and I like songs I can listen to everyday.
And I’m a dancer I live on music and I like songs I can listen to everyday.
Madonna is like that as well.
Well, iceberg. It seems like you have a good hold on spotting trends. How do you incorporate that sensitivity into contemporary production of music?
I felt this way after my car accident.
Gobble gobble witches
So we need to do the pardoned presidential Turkey. I’ll leave my hair down to personify it with the costuming.
This is never not funny.
Actually, no, that’s not the truth, Titanic.
I GOT A MESSAGE FOR THIS FILTH
😂😂😂😂 all of the rants I rant on.
Listening!!
:33 icebergs certainly do reflect
What a hilarious skit! Thanks, Bowen. 😂😂😂
Genius
The ship was approaching, and all he could hear was this Irish cacophony 😂
hahah "What was going through your head that night?" lol
I feel like both times I’m getting blackmailed by the old people spooning in the bed.
It’s worse than the Sony hacks.
So not once but twice they send these Bible passages to me.
It’s how I feel at STC sometimes 😂😂💛😘
KILLED. Pardon the pun.
brilliant
Bowen Yang is an American Treasure ❤
This sketch alone got Bowen the Emmy nod for supporting comedy actor and won SNL their Primetime Emmy. Word perfect and endlessly quotable.  12 tracks, no skips, swear to God!
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Somehow Bowen is original, hilarious, classic, relevant, and outlandishly bold all at the same time. The first time I saw the sketch I thought who does this? I must know who this person is, and I’ve been a fan of ever since.
The best snl skit ever
It's about time the iceberg was interviewed. As the berg pointed out it was the water. That ship assaulted and attacked the berg. We must get the berg back to report on Donald Trump and the tariffs.
Such loaded message, "...you came to my island, and you hit me." So many gems in this skit. I have lost count of how many times I've watched it.
So whatever happened to the album? Did it end up not releasing due to controversy?
Easy to cancel an iceberg but not the ocean. Cancelled icebergs go into the ocean. Such a cool, hilarious and witty segment! 😄
Pure gold
Krampus: “we turn our pain into purpose”
I was working out all day so. I did vinyasa yoga
You’re a trendsetter, iceberg.
Say : “THIS ISNT THE F*CKING AUHTOBAHN”
Exactly. This was really therapeutic after my car accident.
The origin of Playboi Carti
the debut of "iceberg gaga"
So it was the anniversary- dead bodies are still floating around in that case
Cause i'm kinda slow I didn't know until I saw this clip when it came out full on knew that Bowen would be a star. I still have to watch this like every 3 months.
1:59
💕💕💕💕💕😘💕😘💕😍😍
Best SNL sketch ever
I have watched this several times and love it every time!
That’s totally how I felt after my car accident - I secretly listened to Jesus take the wheel
Can we scoot to the real housewives of getting 9/11-ed reunion?
GORGEOUS!!!
I’ve watched this multiple times, still cracks me up everytime 😂😂😂
the writers of this predicted the title of Carti’s new album
Just noticed at the end, Che says "I'm Earl Simmons, goodnight!"  Earl Simmons is DMX real name. DMX passed away on April 9, 2021.  this episode posted April 11, 2021.   very sweet 👊💙✨️
Yeah.
When I witness these Unlawful sins Glad I have my loverboy Because #LoveWins
Ed tried to drown Millie In the sex pool  Iceberg can hit him back Cus ed’s a f*ckin fool.
With.. lover boy.
Someone has an anniversary coming up.
I’ll keep your head above water boy Before we’re like the titanic boy Love can touch us one time But it can’t implode us like water too..  Yeah
Are you anticipating this - iceberg?
You know what’s coming up? Your anniversary
One of the greatest skits of all time!!!
So hopefully that type of working entitlement is revoked
Omg imagine Fernando’s ex and her mom as staff at a senior home. They’re the ones that throw people to mediocre living like the shelter
So I don’t think I understand that wannabe firefighters realize that there are other residents in Reston - not just the homeless they think should be “punished” … so they knocked that down. There’s a senior facility & emergency room, a hospital
I felt this way after my car accident. And also at the shelter when the fire trucks go off at the stupidest times
I see.
They should do the Bee that Amber's dog stepped on 😂
Iceberg enduring a break up. 😘
Exactly.
Bowen was perfect 😂😂
I like the way the iceberg ignores the no. Of deaths..😂😂
This still makes me laugh after 3 years. He should have won an Emmy for this 😊😂❤
Bowen Yang showed up on my TV once and he’s become the most important thing in my life.
Can we come together and admit that SEVERAL major artists have released projects called 'Music' since this iconic sketch. I don't know why, but it's a fact so
Draven thoughts on Alan?
So.
He’s really good at chess and poker
So Draven is like jack on titanic if not better.
If it’s $15 I’ll get it and listen and hype it.
Orcas syndrome.
Again I’d like to get the album - and also try to understand the wildlife that inspired the music
Iceberg is gorgeous
“[Insert humorous quote from video here]” [Insert reaction emoji or “I’m literally dying” here]
Imagine drowning in a giant metal coffin to have this made 100 years later 💀
This was pretty bad. A good joke or two, but not my Dr. Pepper.
I can't get enough of this skit
Okay so let’s pass out his album to the audience - studio pays for it
Exactly.
There was room on the door.
I can't freaking believe that I get to exist on the same planet while Bowen is doing SNL.
It's the watTerrr😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤
"You wanna do this? Fine, let's do this. First of all, you came to where I live and YOU HIT ME!"  Every line in this sketch is iconic!
bravo😂😂😂
Love titanic
Iceberg is gorgeous!!
Bowen is just the BEST cast member of SNL at this point. He's sooo iconic I swearrr! 😫😮‍💨✨️🗣❤️‍🔥
One of the greatest skits in SNL history
Love Bowen
And you look gorgeous 🥰
I’d buy the album, iceberg.
Just heard Gaga's Zombieboy and I can't help but think the song was inspired by Loverboy.
Bowen should host an oscar or golden globes
Ive watched this sketch at least a few dozen times in the past couple of years and I remember thinking to myself Bowen really is a talent. Fast forward to today he’s presenting awards at the Oscars and starring in huge movies and all round taking off in the industry. I’m so happy for him and I can’t wait to see him flourish even more!
EVEN AFTER 3 YRS ITS SOOOO FUNNY!🤣😂😂
I thought he was gonna make jokes rhyme between “sinking” and “singing” when he talked about his album.😅
No comedy happening here
Not funny at all, just like every other SNL sketch.
And that’s how you become main cast member!
1:35 The Berg loses it
Bowen hit that moment here. Hilarious.  Memorable.
"THEY DROWNED BITCH!" is my favorite line 😂
I love watching Saturday night live comedy haha
Oh, the publicist tricked the ice berg; it was "singing" not "sinking"
I never saw this skit before, but it's goofy!
this pure comedic genius, every line is so funny and talented. Every so often, i will circle back to this clip just to appreciate Bowen.
This is weird and crappy - yeah they are highlighting the woke - overly - love him but they are trying to keep this show alive cos they've milked every single topic they possibly can- typical greedy producers.
I LOVE THIS SKETCH.  Bowen Wang is the best.
IIRC, this was from Bowen’s first episode.
Ok  this is funny ,,,ITS WAA TER!  THEY DROWNED
My husband and I quote this so much that the other day I heard my 9yo daughter saying, "Why are you ATTACKING me!" In Bowen Yang's voice multiple times. 😂
“ THEY ICEBURGEDED? NO THEY DROWNED.”
an album called Music is very avant garde 90's
Anyone else noticed how he keeps lowing the number of people?😂
😂
I bet they were so proud when they came up with the line “Nobody’s canceling the ocean!”
"What was going through your head that fateful night?" "A FREAKING BOAT!!"
A classic 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
It shouldn't work, but it's just so brilliant.
this really is a work of art
DRAVEN!!
3:08 the moment when he realised he just said the b__h word is hilarious 🤣
The "Titanic Iceberg" is EVERY self-absorbed celebrity/activist/politician EVER when confronted with the consequences of her or his actions.   :)
Conan O Brien mentioned this on his podcast. Great job Bowen!
As a fan of iceberg, I love your lover boy song - my question is.. how did (aside from titanic and the human bodies) - how did orcas, dolphins, their frequency etc. influence your music? Against your heartbeat? #IceBergsHaveAHeartBeat
Titanic is overrated
Not the iceberg having a rider containing prescreened questions 🫢
@Russia
"Like 40 or 50 people died or whatever" 😂
“Obviously I hate that,like, 20 or 30 ppl died or whatever…”😂
Bowen Yang. Weekend. Cynthia CONNOR 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😍😍😍💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💝💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
Something about the way he says “the sinking” is just perfect
How can we have so many channels and Yang hasn’t got his own show?
What went through your head. He should’ve said the Titanic.
To be fair, the the iceberg has a point. He was just sitting there and got hit.
Now i need the water side of story 😂
Colin: what was going through your head that fateful night?  I expected the iceberg to answer "a ship".
I love how Bowen makes objects have the sensibility of a perpetually offended gay guy.
The answer to “what was going through your head” is obviously “the titanic.”
Justice for the iceberg.
Moodeng 🦛
I guess the Titanic wasn't "big" enough to get through the ass of the iceberg.
Ive watched this too many times 😅
I come back to this clip about oh idk every other month since it was aired...
Back again 😂😂😂. Bowen SERVED!!!!😂😂
This is absolute GOLD 😂
No. "They Drowned B!+ch. Hey Starline, you built a bad boat, that's on you, honey." - Bowen Yang SNL  lol :D
Bowen is magic. 🪄
You know what. I’m on Ice burgs side. They built a shitty boat and had shitty people operating it and those people didn’t drown in ice. WATER!
I wonder what that hat felt like.
“full on Riverdance”
"Wine me. Dine me. I had an early lunch, but I'm hungry for you, loverboyyy~" 🤣
Sorry, but the iceberg is water😄so they both take the blame
Can Bowen come back for another Titanic sketch as the final floating door please?
Iceberg was Asian. 😂
They played this at my school
Sorry News Lactivism   SNL
Spin News Left.   SNL
there is a woman who laughs really loud and annoying she should never come back to the studio
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
To this day, my mother still refers to Bowen Yang as “the gay iceberg on SNL”.
why's no-one talking about how good the Loverboy is, I mean it's actually good.
Well, I mean, he's not wrong. They did bump into HIM.
I love this. Bowen is hilarious and Colin is the perfect straight man. Also kudos to the writer.
No ones cancelling the ocean😂😂😂
This buoys me up every single time no matter how crazy my day is! Thanks Bowen❤
Where is the album !!!??
"What was going through your head that fateful night?" (OMG, did he say that??? LOL)
That iceberg still won't take responsibility and the album did have some skips.
THE ICEBERG IS INNOCENT
I enjoyed the song. please bring it back
Years old but clicked because it's still the best Bowen 😂😂😂
Next year I’m dressing as the iceberg! 😂
Did he win am Emmy for this?
😂🎉
RIP to all the innocents who died
whimsical and hilarious!
Colin is INSANELY sexy.
it's called music😂
iceberg is a virgo bc he was spitting facts no one wanted to hear lol
Your case is dismissed. You are free to go, Mr. Iceberg!
tragedy+time=comedy
“What was going through your head that fateful night?” A better response should have been, “You mean besides the ship?”  I feel like this was a missed opportunity here.
the day i find someone who knows this line by line its over
That iceberg should collaborate with playboi carti
Bowen Yang has been the best hire in the past 2 decades for SNL
2:58: Colin he literally is the victim. The Titanic ran into him, not the other way around.
I thought the Iceberg was Jewish
brilliant
Need to rewatch after moo deng 😂😂😂😂
Kaden Lakes
The “before I can turn around, HALF MY ASS IS GONE-“ got me 😭😭
This has got to be the longest insurance claim that I have ever seen in my life! When is the shit going to get settled?! Who is handling this?! is it Jake from State Farm? Is it mayhem from Allstate? Who is it?!
Heard an interview with Bowen on the Carvy/Spade podcast and had to rewatch this.  This is definitely one of the classic SNL bits.  It definitely anchored Bowen's place on SNL.
But who is going to tell the Iceberg what he is made up of? 🤭 WATAH
Sanford Skyway
“Irish cacophony” perfectly describes my family Christmases
4:17 Love the tribute to DMX.
Willy Stream
😂😂😂
And a legend was born!
Ice, Ice, Baby!!!!
If the Iceberg were Gen Z
The iceberg was gay?
Bowen kenan and weekend update are literally the only reason i watch snl anymore.
Just went back to this after watching Bowen's Moo Deng skit 🤣
Yo... Justice for Iceberg.... Water is to blame.
YouTube adding a fact check to this is amazing for “When you search or watch videos related to topics prone to misinformation”
The best part is that the icebergs song has nothing to do with the Titanic or being an iceberg
Bowen Yang is so gifted. I love him!!!
Nobody could embody an Iceberg like Bowen Yang does
I'm still laughing so hard on this skit in 2024 😂
He’s the funniest guy around. Brilliant comedian.
The titanic hit the ice, not their fault lol but how did Bowen get away with “white face “ 🤪
Why are people laughing? Is it because hes portraying an extremely flamboyant iceberg? I dont get it.
Hilarious skit but the SNL laugh track is terrible.  Nearly ruins this and other skits.
It’s 2024 and I still go back to this great sketch. I am glad that Bowen has continued to have success; he deserves it.
The iceberg reminds me of excuses made by Hamas supporters.
“First of all you came to where I live and you hit me” “Half my ass was gone” “They bumped into me and I said oh I’m sorry which is insane” “Everyone’s talking about me no one’s talking about the waterrrrr” “They drowned bitch, that’s not me that’s water” “Nobody’s cancelling the ocean” “Hey white star line, ya built a bad boat”  omg I can’t breathe 😭😂
Every bottom gay guy! Half my ass is gone which was my best feature
Predictable routine.
White Star Line STILL getting shade to this day.
3 years and I'm still waiting for the full version of Lover Boy
I love this bit.
🤣🤣😂😅😅😅😂😂🤣🤣🤣
Dumb.
Here from Conan's podcast!
The BEST skit by SNL in the past 10 Years!  Love Bowen’s take!
Bowen is a weenie
When they were thinking up this skit it probably sounded really stupid but this turned out to be hilarious
this is kinda disrespectful to the over 2000 people who died on the titanic, this looks like a comedy show
"12 tracks, no skips swear to God" In other words, oops all bangers 😂😂
This is not your first time here and it won't be your last
Whoever wrote this sketch needs a raise! 😂
"Loverboy" is a legit song that I'd dance to. Lyrics are 🔥
This sketch is every bit as clever as it is bizarre. Well done! 🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏
Oh a gay Asian ice berg.  How diverse.
I didn't know the Iceberg needed gay energy, but it really did.
Way to spit on all the innocent lives lost. Disgusting.
Petition for full version of Lover Boy....
I’m gay and I kinda wanna hear the album
this is a classic!
It's my favorite SNL skit.
like who even came up with this whole thing LOL one of the best skits for sure
I love every line in this skit. I keep watching every time it shows up. Very creative. So funny!
He didn’t answer the most important question: is his album “Music” available on Spotify?
It’s 2024… So… like Ms. Berg said, did they actually make a movie about the incident? 😒
This is 3 years ago but still so funny everytime I come across it.
Bowen is just GOD AWFUL!  He is the absolute worst cast member in the history of SNL, in my opinion. He is unbearable to watch, literally. I will skip anything he's in now because I can't take it.
It's funny because the iceberg wouild've melted long before now
The worst comic ever on snl terrible timing not funny cringe cringe cringe
Sank you for being here ?
Why do I want to be besties with an iceberg
This is in my top 10 go-to SNL sketches for when I need a good laugh 😂
The concept of an iceberg being all butt hurt that the Titanic came to his neighborhood and crashed into him is a scream. And Yang's iceberg is just petulant and aggrieved enough to pull off the bit in a satisfying way without it getting awkward.
He is great, wonderful. magnificent.
He is formidable.
The campy amazing, gay iceberg just sends me.
Hahaha!!!  So VERY COOL and Brilliant! Genuine Lol!  😂. #TooSoon!  😂
In the year 2113, SNL will interview the aircraft that crashed during 9/11…….. not so funny now😉
I hear Bowen is in Dr. Seuss’ The Cat in the Hat! Who is he playing?
NOW I GET WHY HES CALLED ICEBERG SLIM, WIT YO HIGH MILEAGE ASS LOL
CHILLIN LIKE SLAYING VILLIAN
So damn good🤣🤣
Waters been real quite since this dropped
I’m so glad this video is finally available! Bowen is so funny
This is a Mighty Boosh character 😂
Hey white star line you built a bad boat
Only Bowen could possibly pull this off 🎉🎉😂😂
LMFAO I LOVED THIS
This has become one of my all time fave SNL clips.
1:59 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Now i need the wooden door with not enough room for Jack to make an appearance
This is so good
This is like stefon meets girl you wish you hadn't started a conversation with at a party with a dash of Gaga and I love it
Costume design is phenomenal, as usual.
I was waiting for Diarrhea
It's the strap under the chin for me.
Do people really think this is funny?
"Ya built a bad boat. That's on YOU, Honey!"
HALF MY ASS IS GONE 😂😂😂
I'm with Mr. Berg on this one. He was just floating on the current with little control and a giant ship hit him. A ship that had power and could steer. Sure 20 or 30 people died, but that was the water. And the movie did well commercially and critically. The music was a big hit for everyone involved. Why are we hung up on this? Everyone that died would have been dead by now anyway. Get over it.
Imagine him as an iceberg, just chillin, reflecting, with his ass above water and the rest of him floating below the surface.
Music is actually a rad name for an album
when I am feeling sad I keep coming back to this and LMAO
#canceltheocean
This sketch is my Roman Empire
Bowen is a godsend
112 years ago today, April 14th 2024, the Titanic Boat Stuck Bowen Yang's Titanic Iceberg Head. Isn't Iceberg a German name? Does Germany have that many icebergs? These are things I ponder late at night.
One of greatest comedy skits ever. Normally most SNL skits are trash but this was a masterpiece- pure genius
I'm an Irish American and I LOVE  Bowen Yang!  "First of all, you came to where I LIVE, and you HIT ME!!!!" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"You built a bad boat". 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He is great. Bowen is incredible.
So disrespectful 😡🤬
QR uv ef
2 yrs later, gay icebergs are melting
Two years later and this sketch still makes me cry laughing 😂
"iM hErE tO pRoMotE mY aLbUm" 💅✨
Ive probably rewatched this more often than any other snl skit
Gold.  Bowen Yang is pure comedy Gold.
"Oh, I'm sorry!" - Canadian iceberg
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌🙌🙌
😂😂😂
Your shaming me George! 😂😂😂😂😂
"... but nobody's cancelling the ocean!"  (meanwhile, the movement of water north and south throughout the Atlantic is weakening due to climate change lmfao we're all gonna die)
I like how Bowen scoffs at rhe album title being "Music" as if to say "who the fuck wrote that line?"
He made this a brilliant bit.
I really don't know how I feel that YT had to create a "Context" segment to put under the video...do people not know how to Google anymore?
Still a far better story than those god awful animated Titanic movies.
They "Iceberged"? 😂
That is god awful! Plus Yang is in whiteface??? … was the writers room passed out on the ‘tuss that day, and the talent had to write or improv a few sketches. Genuinely terrible …   How many handjobs do the SNL “regulars” have to give to Lawn, knowing it’s just a escape platform to worse but better paying ex snl sander farrel Hadler films or worst case ensemble cast Netflix shows.
❤
If I was an SNL writer for when Jost asked Yang what he'd say to the families I would have wrote  "They're dead, why should they care?"
Cute
Does no one else find it freaking weird as hell that these liberals will always put an Asian guy in and he’s either gay, a nerd, or a martial artist… but mostly gay. I hate liberals so much.
He’s a killer.  Get the giant hair drier.
“You said you would be my Oprah, Colin!”…”Well someone diiiid!!” lives rent free in my head!!!😂😂😂
AWESOME!!! BEST SKIT OF THE NIGHT!!! ❤❤❤❤❤
Was this supposed to be funny? I didn't know Saturday Night Live was still on.
Crap skit with crap cast members. Hacks.
They ruined SNL Bowen Yang sucks and has never made me laugh.
God this is not funny at all
"The iceberg from Titanic everybody!!"  "Thats not my name!😂
“Ok, you wanna do this?!”
Bowen is one of my all-time favorite cast members!
The wa-ter! I never get tired ov watching & lierally lol at this! LOVE you. Bowen!! ❤❤😂
new cast is boring especially the gay asian
“I said Oh I’m sorry, which is… insane.” 😂😂😂
Shit is so damn funny
Never seen a gay iceberg before...and SO gay...
The titanic was even called an unsinkable ship if it couldn't handle a single piece of ice then how could it possibly handle a rocky shore. Iceberg: Unsinkable my ass.
What was going through your head that night , iceberg? Ugggghh the eefen titanic!! 😂
I came to watch this clip because I wanted to know what America thinks is amazing comedy.   I think the U.S. might be in trouble  Why is the iceberg also an offensive gay stereotype?
I would stream the fuck outta Lover Boy😂
That’s not my name 😂😂😂
bowen yang is a comedy genius
“I had an early lunch”…the iceberg’s a bottom. 😂 Who else picked up on that? Lol
I can't believe I missed this one from several years ago. Bowen Yang is a National Treasure like Kate McKinnon was and Will Ferrell. This was amazing. Hilarious. Give this man a raise and an Emmy.
Such a missed opportunity for a joke:   Colin: What was going through your head? Iceberg: You mean, besides a boat??
Bowen Yang is brilliant.
My favorite Snl’s cast member
I love all the iceberg jokes that almost fly under the radar: "There's so much more to me that you...can't see" and "I was in my home...chilling!"
Thank God youtube added context about the, Titanic
GENIUS
Wish I could re-like this every time I watch it.
This is when I was like, Bowen Yang is gold!
When he says “okay .. no .. these are not the questions we discussed” it’s giving Dakota Johnson “actually no Ellen that’s not true”
very funny
Ugh. Tediousssss!
Possibly the best SNL skit ever.
4:12 Did he really just say, the iceberg from _Satanic_
I never laught so hard !!! Starlight you built a bad boat , lol! No body is canceling the ocean. 😅😂
#IcebergLivesMatter
this is the most hilarious thing you have ever done, in the history of forever, dog bless snl 🐶❄
"George Santos" lead me here, after Bowen's epic cold open this past Saturday night.  I don't see how people can call this one here a "classic". Imitating reality--showing how ridiculous some politicians truly are. That's always the best kind of sketch. An SNL' trademark.'
Beck Bennet and Kyle Mooney's awkward style in Bad Boys and Inside SoCal are my type of humor; but I appreciate this as a GOAT aling with John Mulaney's pandemic NYC musical theater productions of the diner lobster, the bodega, and LaGuardia Airport. The Bronx Beat series, so many Justin Timberlake singing skits that were about the store mascot competitions, the Lonely Island songs really opened up a whole new genre in SNL, Please Do Not Destroy is epic. Debbie Downer's Disney skit is one I cannot stop rewatching. Now, to rival that we have Lisa from Temecula. And the latest to join is Protective Mom with Pedro Pascal. I love the exclusive Spanish speaking skits, it's a whole new thing. The latest one woth Bad Bunny in The Age of Discovery is one I need more of and rewatched so many times.
12 Tracks… No Skips 📀
For an iceberg, he's really sensitive about "that night." 😂😂😂😂😂
This bit has become one of those SNL classics, like David Pumpkins, “Jane you ignorant slut”, and Debbie Downer at Disney.
He was technically right. It wasn't the iceberg that killed everyone it was the water. 🤣🤣🤣
This sketch is when I fell totally in love with Bowen 🥰
That Iceberg has an attitude 😂
Coming up next.. interviewing the chernobyls reactor, promoting his new cook book 'radiation contaminated dinner ideas' and also another clarification on why is it not his fault the meltdown happens. "They force me to produce energy way beyond my capacity.. so.. i leaked some to prevent stress, i didnt know it would trigger an explotion!!"
This is hysterical! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
They Iceberg-ed.
Very offensive and repulsive
I absolutely adoooore this comedian !!!
“They iceberged?? NO, they drowned, bitch, THAT’S NOT ME, THAT’S *WA-TER!”* had me on the floor- 😭
Music....  *MUSIC*
I just noticed the effing Encyclopedia Britannica article under the video with the history article about the Titanic pinned for "Context". Sometimes I love this planet XD XD
I SEE THEM
They should bring this back but with water being present.
I think Lumpy Space Princess and Iceberg would get along
He s not wrong.The water kill all those people
Thr black guy is homophobic
MAN, does Colin Jost ruin almost every good bit.
I hope they put this costume in a museum 😄
I think this is one of the best skits ever hands downs!! Bowen is brilliant!!!
Why was this recommended to me? I tried to give it a chance but Christ, do people genuinely find this funny?
"12 tracks.... no skips"😂
I want to like this a hundred times.
awesome every single time
This is purely ICONIC!
😂😂😂😂 I'm never going to stop watching this.
🥱 unfunny
I never get tired of this skit. Lol.
The hat!
But for serious, I need a full length version of "Loverboy", thank you
In 20 years people will come back to this and say “remember when SNL used to be funny”
You can make a joke about anything given enough time
Comedic genius!!
To be honest, I will not be able watch Titanic in same way as before.
"You said you would be my Oprah!!!"  Love it
This is brilliant on so many levels of the insanity of the woke left.😅😅😅
One of my co-worker's phone went off during an all-staff meeting and her ringtone was Bowen going "HALF MY ASS IS GONE" and it was amazing
My favorite SNL news interview.
Why are you attacking meeeeeeee-ya?
this is still so epic
Wow!  Now I know why I quit watching SNL.  Horrid.
THE scene that quickly ushered in what would become the Bowen Yang Era on SNL and seal him as a comic legend.
Amazing there isn’t a ukelele here
In the iceberg’s defense, the Titanic said it was unsinkable
Bowen Yang is one of the greatest actor/comedians of my generation. The range of this man is just stunning. You might see him play the part of an effeminate gay Asian man in one scene and then the next scene has him playing a completely different effeminate gay Asian man. It's just an incredible transformation and I love watching it every time. Sometimes, I will see one of his characters and I will have to go look up who is playing the part because I simply can't believe it's Yang! I am totally shocked how he just disappears into his roles. I have to wonder how many hours, nay years, he spent on knees perfecting his acting craft.
An SNL modern day classic!
Can someone for the love of god explain why people find this funny?
Blessings from Taiwan Thank you Bowen Yang!
Do not like woke-ish jokes. Sorry.
Bowen Yang is my spirit animal!
Next Bowen Yang should play the carbon fiber tube that crushed the Titan submarine passengers. "I did my best OK! You all knew I could only take so many dives before I cracked and you just kept pushing! Hostile work environment!"
Why didn’t they put the make up on the neck and the ears?
I’m curious, what was the icebergs name. Because at the end he says that “iceberg” is not the name. In that case, what is the icebergs name, Jerold? Frosty? The person that I am wants to call someone by what their name is, or by how they act
Do not watch this while high
Too soon
Comedy yadayada...I don't care! Where can I buy the "Loverboy" song!
The title its self is misleading. its suppose to be The Iceberg which the Titanic collided that why it sunk.. well we all know who's fault it is
Awesome Clip... you may be interested in my video:  Could Titanic Survive a Head-on Collision with the Iceberg? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To_oFAoFOeY
Easily one of the best skits on SNL.  Now he has accused the water for causing the huge loss of life, they should bring this skit back but have him joined by the water, having a full blown debate about who was actually at fault with the water trying to sue him for defamation.
BELLEND
This is giving NYC club kid
"What was going through your head that night?" 😂  One of the best lines ever, but don't know if Colin quite nailed it
Omg love him!
“Oh my god, they’re going to make a movie about this.”   They did. They made one a literal month after the sinking and one of the main actors was an actual victim and because of that movie had a mental breakdown
Typical Colin. Being such a jerk to the iceberg for no good reason. We aren't just our biggest mistakes and we shouldn't have to constantly be reminded of them. Of course in some cases that's impossible since Scarlett Johansson has to see Colin every day and be reminded of their marriage.
So cleaver, witty, and really coming from the perspective of the iceberg yep! Would like to see more along the same lines
Im going to side with the iceberg! because it explained the situation in details. don't worry about that ass that has been chipped by the ship though i will regenerate! Kudos on your Album named " Cold Music"
Imagine traveling back in time and showing this skit to Thomas Andrew’s as the ship went down💀
To be fair the iceberg made a good point. It was just chilling in the water and then big boat came along at full speed and rip it ase off. 😂
"Oh my god their going to make a movie about this" 😂
Irish cacophony 😂
“40 or 50 people died or whatever” “1500” “WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING ME?!?”
So the iceberg is gay? Gawd, this show should've been put out of its misery decades ago.
Too soon
So where can I get the album lol.,
Anyone here after the submersible?
I come back to periodically watch this skit 👏 all 👏 the 👏 time 👏
Sadly I've came here twice after those sad sub people paid all that money because of the obsession of The Titanic
I love you Bowen Yang. You finally got the story straight.
He gotta do a PT.2 response LMAO
Watched it again because of the submarine issue 😂. One of the best skits at SNL
Lollll
They should bring this interview back for the submarine
How is nobody talking about how he complains about the "Irish cacophony"  then launched into the Mexican Hat Dance. 😂
now after that submarine event... you can replace the iceberg in this skit and replace it with the titanic.
I know it's poor taste and people would meltdown over it, but I'd love to see the iceberg coming back to talk shit about the submersible that sank. "Ya built a bad submersible, that's not on ME"
the camera guy is laughing
iceberg to another iceberg: "I sank the titanic, what have you done with your cold miserable life you piece of ice"
Given recent events you need to consider doing a sequel - does the iceberg get blamed for “Ocean Gate” too?
Please make a follow up video about the titan submarine
Watching this after billionaires stupidly died getting into a death trap. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Imagine if they made a new skit where the sea pressure will be a guest on this show because of the Titan's implosion.
Are we getting a part two
Came from a Tiktok comment on a Titan / sub incident video “No one tells the story from the icebergs pov”
Maybe the same iceberg sunk the Ocean Gate sub
I hope that headpiece ends up in the Smithsonian.
And now the Titan submersible is going to blame said ice.
This is an excellent skit. Can’t believe I’ve never seen this before.
The iceberg watching this missing submarine fiasco like not these dumbasses again.
WILHELM GUSTLOFF.; ESTIMATED 9400 DEAD......FEW PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THAT!
Actually they froze to death. Plus the Iceburg only took a glancing blow, lost next to almost no ice in relationship to its mass.
Bowen is just sooo good in this skit. I love 💕 it! Makes me happy every time I watch it! Can we get a part 2 please? 🤗💫🙌🫧
I have watched this at least a hundred times. It never ceases to crack me up:) thank you Bowen!
I’m a new fan I would go to see his movies 🍿 he’s going yo be huge in comedy
He's a great addition to the crew
thank god there are laugh tracks in this video so I know when to laugh and when not
ICONIC
“It was midnight, I was chilling.” This is the best skit.
He missed a good opportunity. "What was going through your head that day?" "The ship, stupid. That's why we're here."
Now let's do a skit with the water's POV.
I’m fairly certain I’m responsible for only about 1.2 million of the nearly 5 million views of this sketch.
It was midnight, I was chilling.  😅😅😅😅.
I’m in love with the idea that an iceberg has a publicist and an album of hyper pop EDM new disco fantasia!
No one, NO ONE else could play the iceberg but him
Bowen Yang.  Dassit.
Why are you attacking me😢😢😢
Awesome so funny😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Im still waiting on that album
there's literally no limit to how many times u can watch this video, bowen is incredible
He has a point, CANCEL THE OCEAN!
“Those two people who died or whatever”. 😂
i love him  oh god .....
“Why are you attacking me!” Is my favorite line 😂
I clicked on this video because I could not for the life of me figure out what Bowen was wearing on his head😂😂😂
was lookin for a song but no music on me youtube :|
Looking forward to the 9/11 version of this in 2100 where the airplane defends itself. "Did they plane'ed to death? No they burned/were crushed to death, bitch"
I'd buy that album.
I can't get past " Irish concoffinie."
The characters this man plays 😂😂😂
ROFL.....
I had an Early Lunch, and I'm Hungry for you, Lover Boy!
Sia is quaking at that "Music" album joke
I'm back after 10 months to laugh again!!!!
"What was going through your head that fateful night?" "...a boat, Colin."
One of the best skits.
Why does Bowen Yang always sound like that stupid gossipy girl we all we went to middle school with. 🤦🏼‍♂️🤢🤮
"That's not me, that's WA-TER" so... who's gonna tell him?
I still want to know it's name.
"They bumped into me. I said 'Oh, I'm sorry,' which is insane!" xD The social commentary ♥
This just helped me get the joke ending of the movie!  JACK COULDN'T GET ABOARD
I wish we knew his name… Iceberg is not it! Lol
Just utterly hilarious. And, the iceberg made some damn good points!
This keeps showing up in my feed. I laugh every time.
Bowen is the bestest!
This is an instant classic. ❤
This will always be EPIC. This was the first skit I saw him in and it’s just brilliant. Think about it often. especially when he dressed up for the Chinese spy balloon, I am mediately thought of this.
That song is great! It’s a big…hit
Half my ASS is GONE....which was my best feature!
Who thought of this?! Brilliant!
More like riceberg
"So I said 'I'm sorry' which is ridiculous"
"First of all you came to where I live and you hit ME" is delivered so perfectly
Lmao so hilarious 🤣
WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING MEEEEEEEEEUH!!!
Came here after hearing Bowen on Conan O'Brien needs a friend podcast 😁
I really don’t comment on SNL because I don’t care for the show. I’m looking forward in 20 years to see another show pick fun at a soon defunct show that’s corny at best. Good luck!!!
This isn’t even funny! Rip to the victims. It doesn’t matter how much time that has passed, it still doesn’t make it alright to make light of such a traumatic event that caused mass scaled death. *SNL SUCKS!*
Birth of an SNL legend
Sassy Iceberg❤❤❤
they should do this skit again but from titanic like the actual ships pov and have them argue
The lyrics of his song should be that he had a "LATE lunch but I'm hungry for you" -- why would an "EARLY lunch" spoil his dinner?  😛
jokes aside, interviewers do this all the time. they promise to not ask questions you're uncomfortable with, but it's all a trick to get you on the show, and when the interview starts they start attacking. what're you gonna do, walk out of a live interview? they have you cornered
a hyperpop-EDM-nü disco fantasia, it's called MUSIC.
his irish cacophony sounds more like a mexican cantina
Seems like exactly what George Santos would say🤣🤣🤣
One of the best SNL videos
THIS IS A CLASSIC!
I never found gays comedians funny at all but this man is hilarious.  Outrageously funny!
Just because icebergs are cold does not mean they are insensitive
I love Bowen Yang...
This is one of my favorite skits!!
"They bumped into me and I said, 'I'm sorry.'" Gotta be a Canadian iceberg!
Top 10 all cursive send-off
3:42 CL BLUSHES HARD 😊 🤣  that iceberg is 2DAMN FUNNY
So good xD
Seriously, that iceberg should be getting the insurance benefits 🤣
I've watched this so many times and will continue to watch it many times!
Can we also appreciate Collin here? ❤
How is this SO FRICKIN GOOD???
This has to be one of the worst comedy sketches I’ve ever seen
It is a parable on *Jan 6.* If Trump and the other ringleaders were ever dragged into court. Which they will not be.
I love how the iceberg... cracks up
I wish I could double like or super like some videos…this would be my audition monologue…12 tracks, no skips, swear to god!
It would be so funny to hear the iceberg talk about how James Cameron made another movie with people being emotional about a boat sinking
Pure genius! Bravo! 🧊🧊💙😂💙🧊🧊
Brilliant. I don't know how many times I've watched this sketch.
I love Bowen 😂
bowen is a national treasure
2:20 'why are you attacking me !?' - spot on 🤣🤣😂😂
Where do I buy the 12 tracks—no skips—swear to God—Loverboy?! 🤣
Bowen is such a rare talent. His whole concept is so beautifully written, costumed and performed that I often watch it just to brighten-up my day. Thanks, Been!
I mean, he's not wrong...
This is insensitive. My son died on The Titianic.
"You were supposed to be my Oprah"  I gagged on my water, I'm definitely using that line.
Not funny
The Titanic will forever remain a synonym for tragedy
I love how he keeps reducing his estimate on how many ppl drown to 20 to 30
That's white face, I'm offended. This is violence.
Bowen Yang, you are not funny.
The idea of the POV of the iceberg is genius.
The whole skit is hilarious, but what Bowen does to the word 'music' @1:20 to avoid corpsing, . . . I dunno if a word has ever been through so much. Bowen's throat and his brain fighting to the death to deliver that word with dignity . . . . Ought to be a ringtone.
Too many iconic lines in one sketch.
😂😂That was very original!!  And he is innocent, that was his turf and they were speeding in the dark night...reckless...poor iceberg.
311 has a very good album named Music, I don't get the non-joke.
This skit is meta af
“12 tracks, no skips, swear to god” 🤣🤣
They bumped into me, I apologized..which is like- insane
And a star is born :)
LOVE this!!!
This is THE PERFECT SKETCH. Masterful! I’ve watched it a scary number of times
How is this literally the best skit SNL has ever done I was so ready to be disappointed 😂😂😂
I don't think they did autopsies
That was so funny
This doesn't get old..
it was the officers on the ship at fault from what i believe
Bowen let’s write more
3:15  I was cheering with them WATER, YOU BIDG
How to launch a career with one skit.
Iceberg should collaborate with William Hong !!!
Immature tasteless humor. You even mentioned families who died and the audience laughs. This should be blocked
Why are you attacking me?!!!! :(  Best line no doubt.
Like, full Riverdance The old people were spooning on the bead, ready to die
OH THANK GOD I've waited for this, for like, a zillenia!!!
“I said Oh I’m sorry, which is INSANE”
This sucks
This is the last funny thing I've seen from SNL until Chapelle's return and boy is it a masterpiece. "WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING MEEE!!????"
i honestly didn’t think i would like this sketch after hearing it talked up… but the song actually saved it for me reminded me of adult swim
2 bears 1 cave brought me here
This gay-sian is super unfunny. what the fuck
Irish cacophony river dancing oh my goodness
Years later I still die laughing
That’s not me bitch!! That’s WATER!!!!
"My new album is called music" *deadmau5 takes notes*
the first minute I was preparing for the next three to be cringe but I actually really enjoyed it hahaha
I think because the iceberg had less to do with it and it might not have ever happened if the singular pair of binoculars weren't locked in a box with the key to access them weren't with a man that didn't make it. Or maybe if they splurged slightly and got a key that would be with the captain.  Plus, there's the theory that it was sunk for the insurance payout (which given the time it was in was a surefire way to Hell, and by "the time" I mean 1912 where Christian God was most prevalent).
This was one of the best skits!
Bowen Yang is just a snarky gay acting Asian guy, just not funny. Plays the same character all the time.
Is it ironic or just weird that there is a flaming iceberg?
This skit is when Bowen Yang moved to my top 10 SNL Greatest!
This is so clever, I am floored by the creativity 🔥
Wow I’ve watched this a dozen times and I just got the “what was going through your head that night” joke. No wonder the iceberg felt the interview was hostile
Put on a costume, talk with a lisp, repeat.  When the show gets canceled, you now know why.
Some dumb shit.
https://youtu.be/yPn6vshtDWU I feel like this guy would be friends with the iceberg, probably buy the album too!
This is what comedy is! Minus the singing at the end.
Imagine the producers pitching this to him? He must've been like, Let's do this Bitches. He nailed it.
Love his costume especially his hat. Bowen Yang is super great wow wow wow i ve been watching this skit so many times 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Iceberg has a point though.
“I don’t really like you too.” -Jack and Cal
iceberg looks dumb
Can confirm: would buy the iceberg’s album like stat.
Its funny how he has the iceberg on his head the whole time
Irish Cacophony 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bowen yang makes gay people hate being gay.
I wonder if that hat was lightweight
"What was going through your head that night?".....BESIDES the 45k ton ocean liner...?!?!!
Best skit ever 😄😄 Bowen Yang is a treasure. Am I the only one who's annoyed by the girl who laughs like she's gagging though? It's ruining the whole thing for me
Bowen is the BEST!  This is hysterical - guess I missed this SNL but glad I had this skit pointed out to me!
I cant when he says  " Oh my god there gonna make a movie about this"
Let’s take away that applause sign and I guarantee you don’t hear a peep. This was as far from funny as you can possibly be.
I LOVE BOWEN YANG!!!!!
Brilliant!!!!😂😂😂
2:17
I would buy his album but solely to make him feel better about the tragedy he obviously didn't cause but is still acused of causing
I love this sketch, one of my top 5 favourites!
I cannot find the Hyperpop EDM New Disco Fantasia record called Music by Iceberg on iTunes...
This never gets old. I can’t count how many times I’ve watched it and I’m always in stitches by the end! 😂🤣
Unlike Jack Dawson, this skit will never die.
Comedic genius. 💯
July 17, 2022  I'm still watching this and laughing.  No one but Bowen could have done this.
No matter how good Bowen is in future sketches, this will always be his best one
IRISH CAUCAFANY 🤣🤣🤣
'Nobody's canceling the ocean ' Never thought I'd find SNL as hilarious post Wiig but this guy is UFFFFFF
I sing this song to my husband every other day. I find it f***ing hilariously
So many parallels to my life , (edit) first album even had 12 songs.
He's so funny, i couldn't stop laughing even after the sketch
Michael kirsky
Will never get old! Classic.
Who went here after Conan's podcast?
come back again to watch this to get some laughs because of what happened in the last few days
This is painfully unfunny
LMAO!!!! Thanks I needed that!
I'd pre-order that album
How much dro do you have to smoke for this to be funny? 😵‍💫 This is about as interesting to watch as an iceberg. F√€£¶π¢ LAME!!  😩🥱
CATHARTIC
TRULYYYYY ICONIC
A classic
I want to hear the Ocean's take on this
The way his head piece bops around when he’s giving attitude 🤣
3:10 Here's almost a blooper, but he nailed it.
Watched this today for the 20th time and I think I noticed small reflections of Fran Leibowitz. Just me?
I screamed out loud 🤣🤣🤣
Easily one of the best SNL sketches of all time. Bowen Yang is one of the greats.
Did anyone catch what name Che called himself in the signoff?
"That's water, they drowned bitch!" I lost it 😂  Omg, they're going to make a movie about this!
One of the all time great sketches surely.
"WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING MEEEEE"- literally everyday for me when i get out of bed and vertigo hits me
Bowen Yang is so dope! Dude is hilarious.
I love Bowen
Not to be the "too soon" guy but...
Singing, he sounds like Klaus Nomi, lol
We should get the iceberg as a musical guest some time
Pop off gay iceberg 💅✨🏳️‍🌈
White star line you built a bad boat. It didn't work out. That's on you, honey. 🤣🤣🤣
I usually end up fast forwarding through his skits but this one was pretty funny
There are so many good lines in here. I can’t possibly quote them all
He is hilarious! Love boy, catchy
😀🔫
If this was the iceberg that sank the titanic, I would have saved everyone if I were on the Titanic.... because this iceberg would have gatekept me!!!!
Coming back for a laugh 😂😂😂😂!!! Love this skit!!!  No one is talking about the Water.
This is one of the best things ever
🤨… WHAT?  This is America now.
I love Bowen he really is the best in this scene every time I need a real good laugh I come back to this ❤️ 💖 💗
I have change my opinion… It’s the waters fault for sure
Not enough Bowen Yang on SNL Need more!
Brilliant sketch
I think this is the new Stefon skit. 😂
Also, can we give two thumbs up to whoever wrote this skit? Thank you.
Bowen is one of the best things that's ever happened for SNL.... comic genius.
I keep coming back for more.
I love this skit so much!!!!! Wish they would bring it back one more time.
this will never not be funny
Bowen Yang is a young legend and this bit is just as funny watching it the 5,000th time as it was the first
“12 tracks, no skips. Swear to god.” Is maybe the funniest thing I’ve ever heard. Especially coming from a vilified iceberg that was just chilling.
This is my favorite sketch 💜
I don't think so honey...the titanic being the victim
4:16 Why is no one talking about the fact that Michael called himself Earl Simmons
I need the Oceans side of this argument!! I’d love it!
Liberal TV, ill pass
Were they iceberged? This is a great skit. And the hat's great too
Im an instant Bowen Yang fan!
This is quite possibly one of the best arguments for the water being at fault. I mean, really.
Too soon!! Ha
I seriously hope he brings back this character for the Titanic’s anniversary this year.
it SANK the Titanic or was it an innocent bystander?
I now realise that all those movies and documentaries was essentially just victim blaming.
Tell me why the song from this weekend update segment got stuck in my head
I really want a full version of lover boy
"half of my ass is gone".  "they bumped into me and i'm like 'im sorry' which is like crazy, but whatever" .... OH MY GOD HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
"It's cold music"
Lover Boy is actually my ringtone now
I'd buy that Loverboy single
There really are two sides to every story
How do people think this is funny
"WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING MEEEEE???"
Why did he attack my passengers!?
I just can’t stop watching this 😂🤙
I WILL NEVER EVER GET SICK OF THIS!!
I don't know how many times I've watched this. But I still laugh like crazy till I tear up😂😂😂. Bowen you are magic!
Build by the Irish destroyed by the English 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yang is brilliant.  More please!
Don't mind me, just doing my weekly SNL comment section check to make sure I stay far as fuck away from anyone who thinks this / SNL, in general, in general is even remotely funny....
My favorite Bowen Yang skit
“i saw this really interesting interview the other day”
The genius tidbit about there being “no skip” tracks on the album brings a whole other layer to this character. Ms. Iceberg is also living in 2001 😂
Iconic
Now I really wanna hear what water has to say about this. I need both sides of the story to make a judgement.
Bowen's facial expressions in this are so fucking funnnyyy
I think you are being disrespectfull about the 1496 people in that dissaster and make a dissaster of wich 1496 people died fun you should not be making it fun you should be respectull to the 1496 people that died that night.
So...what IS the icebergs name, then...??
Classic
😂
😂🤣😂😂🤣!! This is hilarious!!🤣😂🤣😂Awesome Bowen!!
'Why are you attacking me??' gets me every time
4:17 WHAT name did Michael Che give?!?!
I didn’t know icebergs were gay.
Don’t know if he is gay and that’s why he is doing gay iceberg, but this would have been funnier with a dead pan iceberg.
The laughter here is so annoying!!! God whats with them. Really annoying.
Colin is so hot OMG 🤤
Gay asians are supposed to be funny I guess
Poor-Iceberg... The Main villain is still on the loose- The Water How terrifying, Petition to Catch Water soon & interrogate The main culprit   👁⚖ 👁
Bowen Yang is a gem on SNL. Every time he's on Weekend Update, he kills.
2:17
i still watch this 10 times a week..
Oh finally. I've been waiting for this to become available in NZ without a VPN.
I need Icy and Stefon at the same time and place
Priceless! What a comedian
12 tracks no skips swear ta god 😂😭😭😭
Huge props to the costume designer . The design and concept were on point here.
стилистов увольте пожалуйста
The moment he breaks when he re-iterates that the album is called "Muzik" always gets me 😂
FINALLY ON YOUTUBE
When is his hyper-POP, EDM, new Disco Fantasia album coming out? I am so stocked.
What is his opinion on global warming? I feel this needs another round.
"They bumped into me, I said, "Oh I'm sorry," which is... insane, but whatever." 💀💀
Bowen Yang is awesome
I’m so glad that a tragic event that claimed thousands of lives, is a joke to SNL.
This Iceberg gives me Chris Crocker Vibes.
Anyone gonna talk about how the "Irish cacophony" is a dead on perfect impression of Conan O'Brien?
I love how the outfit is semi-Edwardian
This is my emotional support sketch
Oh I love this 😂😂😂😂
So the Iceberg is a gay Asian?   Isn’t this the same character he plays all the time?
i cant!!!!!  hes ssooooo fuunny!!!
Bowen and Matt should launch a lgbtq+ platform cause their humors are another level for straights to understand.
Bowen Yang is not snl material.
Nobody's canceling the Ocean.....
i comeback here literally every month and recite his whole monologue
Bowen is amazing. Damn that’s a hilarious skit. Nobody’s talking about the water , they drown bitch!
This guy is the least funny person ever at SNL and these days that's a pretty hard spot to land.
I laughed so hard at this. I watched titanic again.. twice just last week lol and this iceberg's pov is epic.
Ah, the legend.
I've seen parts of this sketch multiple times without knowing the context or title and I just... assumed it was a parody of the drama seeking party gays and the thing on his head was an exaggerated party accessory and I???? HOW
I absolutely love, love, love Bowen 😁 🤩
Yang is overqualified for SNL.
honestly the iceberg convinced me
This guy is not funny.  Maybe if I was gay and high on meth. But I’m sober and straight so yeah.
Awesome!!!!
“Hey White Star Line, ya built a bad boat. It didn’t work out. That’s on you, honey!” This is in my top 5 best SNL performances of all time. Which also includes Bowen’s first appearance as Chinese Trade Daddy.
everything about Bowen’s delivery and mannerisms here is perfect
Big water. Ocean water.
I love the play on celebrities who come on to shows and get annoyed about talking about why anyone cares about them.  Instead they use it to sell something dumb no one wants.
I really hope this ends up being something they bring back this year 😂
I think I’m in love with an iceberg.
For as silly as this segment is, I appreciate the historical details they actually get right.
"You said you would be my Oprah Colin!"
The song slaps.
i love bowen.
I never get tired of this.
not into skit comedy, but this was good
So stupid. So forced. Not funny. Painful.
Stopped by for a refresher...LMAO 🤣
Bowen said on Conan O’Brien needs a friend that he and his writer watch Paris Hilton being interviewed by letterman after see got out of jail.  https://youtu.be/bAT_nY0n9P0
LOL... the Iceberg is a Millennial. All he needs is a green wig and a bigger entitlement mindset! Hilarious!
How is this funny?
Lame.  Gay cancel culture how boring.
not funny. seriously.
"I said 'oh i'm sorry' which is inSANE" GOD that gets me
Bruuuuuuuuuhhhhhhh when he said NO! THEY DROWNED BITCH 😂😂😂😂😂 IM CRIIIIIINNNNNEEE
When he's like "this is always a really weird time of year for me" he's so cute and endearing! ❤️
Iceberg is Lola from Big Mouth
I’m sorry I love him lol
Haha😑
The way the iceberg talks reminds me of James Charles, the attitude 🤣
The "Irish cacophony" is Gaelic Storm. SNL - you should have them on as a musical guest.
“It’s cult music” 🤣🤣🤣
Lmfao this is my mom. “Why did you stop at a red light and let me hit you doing eighty???” Like imagine caring for someone so retarded but since they have a college degree Bc they went to their fams house to their husbands house it’s ME who is seen as the failure
Lmao at “what was going through your head that night”
Everything about this skit is glorious 😂😂😂
A joke about naming your album Music is hilarious …   Madonna: 😦
but scrachd omg
He went to iceberg jail after raping the titanic
Just doing my daily visit for some laughs
I didn’t know the iceberg was gay!!
LOL.....LOL....LOL
Found out about this sketch on NPR’s Wait Wait Don’t Tell Me… Funny!!
"That's not my Name!" at the end?!  haha.
“But NOBODY’S CANCELLING THE OCEAN” 😭😂
A - mazing performance 🎭 👏🏾
Only Bowen Yang could pull that off, absolutely comic genius reminds me of Tom Hanks David S. Pumpkins, both so talented. Hilarious
Lyrics: "Come on over and kiss me, boy Hold my hand in your brand new house I know you don’t ever wanna miss me, boy So let’s watch a movie tonight in your house  Touch me while the room is spinning Kiss me, let’s go eat some dinner Wine me, dine me, I had an early lunch But I’m hungry for you, lover boy" Honestly wish this was on Spotify 🙂
One of those sketches I look up when I need a laugh.  Thank you Bowen.
Congratulations Bowen Yang, you nominated for an Emmy and playing the character The Iceberg on the Sinking of the Titanic on Weekend Update of Saturday Night Live. 😀😀😄
Yassssssssss love it 🥰
F'in brilliant
Why do I find myself coming back to this skit over and over? Literally, one of the funniest. Bowen Yang is hilarious!!!
That was cold, Mr. Iceberg.
I thought it was a fancy hat
Amazing use of his arms 💪❤️
That guy is freakin great !
This is such an excellent skit. Great writing and execution. ❤️
They should talk abt who was on the Titanic, ppl who didn’t want the Federal Reserve to happen.
This is hilarious. SNL should not lose him.😉
'I had an early lunch'
12 tracks, no skips, I swear!
This is a perfect immaculate jab at the modern internet culture lol.
He was just chillin!
"What was 'going through your head' that night?"  "I've done a lot of 'reflecting' to 'try and move past it'." "It's just a little part of me." The puns are freakin' incredible in this one.
Bowen is just aaaaamazing!
I'm 83 and can't remember anyone or thing (talking inanimate objects) as funny as this. (Maybe Ricky Gervais reimagining the childrens' classic tales.)
Super niche - but does this remind anyone of the Mitchell and Webb sketch on Neil Armstrong? “First singer songwriter on the moon”
this is such a great concept lol
The shade at White Star Lines still takes me out LMFAO "you built a bad boat, honey"
The way he keeps decreasing the amount of people that died when he started at 40-50 people lmfao
"What was going through your head that fateful night?"  The audience definitely didn't get the joke there... It's a shame, it was a brilliant line.
Bowen Yang is lengendary👏👏👏
Bowen Yang is one of the best things to ever hit SNL
I lost count of how many times I watched this! Lol and each time I laughed louder because the ideas and meaning comes together better. Haha
*"... and before I turn around and like... What? Half. May. A**. Is. Gone! Which was my best feature"* 🤣😂
Just the way he says "HALF MY ASS IS GONE"
idk if this was intentional, but props to wardrobe for making it look like a chunk was taken out of his head to resemble the bottom of a ship
I know all the words to “Loverboy”.
show just keeps getting worse
“12 tracks, no skips, swear to god” 3:43  😂😂😂😂
"the sinking"
I mean the iceberg has a point 😂
I have no idea who this is. This is the dumbest sketch I’ve ever seen on SNL
Is it possible “Music” was a dig at Sia?
“Like 20-30 people died!” I swear, I have to come back to look at this every few days. This is hysterical!
One of the reasons I love this skit so much is that the premise was so absurd and likely would have failed if they had used someone else. This was MADE for Bowen and he knocked it out of the damn park. SNL has its fair share of conceptually random absurdity sketches that, 85% of the time, end in a lot of scratched heads and "ehhh..."s. But god, when those types of skits are executed and acted flawlessly like this -- when the cast member(s) just go all-in, balls-to-the-wall, batshit crazy committed to the bit -- they are PERFECTION. That 15% of the time that they do work is nothing short of magical and this was the cream of the crop, I'm so glad I got to witness this iconic moment of SNL history
This was an absolutely LEGENDARY moment in not just SNL history but television history in general
why does this iceberg act like trisha pastas
Yeah, anyone who's more pissed at the iceberg for just existing in the ocean than they are about the human beings who claimed they'd built an "unsinkable" boat, didn't put nearly enough lifeboats on it, then speeded across the ocean in the pitch dark is just not valid. The Titanic catastrophe was a tragedy because it was inherently preventable. Blaming the iceberg for existing is like acting like the poor mail service is to blame in Romeo and Juliet, rather than any of the dozen adults who could've stopped the feud at any time if they could just get over their own stupid pride long enough to do right by their children.
"I'm here to promote my album." "Half my ass was gone!" "Nobody's talking about THE WATER!!!"  This is the best!
Not even funny the dumbest thing I've ever seen and the stain on Humanity
I am so stuck on this one. It just grows on you like Brown himself. Break a leg, berg!
We need more Bowen
U said u were my Oprah ...
I feel like I come back here at least once a month or so just to laugh like I’ve never seen it. Pure Genius!
I’d love to see him again maybe next time promoting a new album and Colin wants to ask him about climate change.
This is one of my favorites. When I  showed this to my 63 yr old mother she snorted her sip of wine through her nose and poked her hand with her sewing needle.
Iceberg: i didn’t hit it. it hit me.
Only a gay man could have thought of something so niche, yet culturally relevant and poignant
This is hilarious! 🤣😂
THIS IS HILARIOUS. XD
Very good
This skit has taken up way too much real estate in my brain since 3am.
Who not name the one star of this video in the description, #BowenYang?
You can tell something is funny when Colin breaks character, he didn't break character for this lol.
This is the funniest thing SNL has done in years
this is the gay comedy representation we deserve
He’s giving me very much Lola Ugfuglio Skumpy
Bowen hit it out of the park with this. You can't imagine anyone else portraying the Iceburg but Bowen. He owns it.
Isn't this whiteface?
😆
Justice for the iceberg
"What was going through your head that evening?" 'The Titanic.  Thanks for reminding me!'
This saved SNL season one of the best non-political based sketch!!!!! 🙌🏼
LOLOLOL 1:18 Yeah.. It’s called “Music”
I need a full cover of loverboy.
I am screaming!!! 😂😂😂😂
bring back the iceberg
"Thank you for that...QUEStion..."
Bowen Yang is the new Chris Kattan...they both play gay really well. That one was for Norm- Suck it,Kattan!
If this doesn’t deserve emmy I don’t what does
I can’t watch Titanic anymore! I get to the point where the ship hits and is starting to sink and I just giggle picturing this frozen sassy bitch
Only Bowen can make an iceberg funny 😂💙
Imagine how the Iceberg would react to the animated Titanic movies.
Who's watching this for the 10th time
This did get me curious about how long icebergs last. Turns out just a few years as they drift into less cold water.
Best SNL skit ever!
The dislikes are just the relatives of the 10 or 20 people who died
"I hate that 40 or 50 people died, or whatever".  LOL
Awesome :D :D
More Bowen Yang Please on SNL...
David Rose vibes
No THEY DROWNED BITCH- sassy iceberg 2021
When he almost laughs when he says "yeah its called music" kills me every time.
"No they drowned bitch" lol the sass in this line
This is the first TV Skit I've seen that acknowledges Hyperpop
One of the best SNL skits EVER.
Iceberg had a point…
They should have put a black line across the side of the iceberg head and made it look like the ship ran into him.....
This man needs to be everywhere!!!!
So unfunny it’s a miracle I’m still alive.
The acting is Emmy worthy but the content is disgusting to pick on a real tragedy. I bet you could have achieved the same with a different story
I think we need to hear from the water and the Titanic. Just to be fair. 😂
This is so funny
1:31
Where is 🌊?
Genius.
Where is the album, Bitch?  12 tracks, no skips.  You PROMISSSSDA!  I checked iTunes.  lol
This is the worst thing I’ve ever seen
Every now and then I'll revisit this skit, it is so damn funny.
Yeah Lil Sas was right
Iceberg: "Nobody's talking about the water!" That's not me!" Me: "But honey, you are basically frozen water..."
I love how Bowen Yang asked Collen if he liked his joke at the end of the sketch. He must be protected at all cost !!!!!
I say “You said you’d be my Oprah!” on a daily basis but nobody knows what I’m talking about.
i can never resist clicking to watch it again
"Why are you ATTACKING ME!?" You said you would be my Oprah Colin" "Well someone did"
Iceberg: “Hey, White Star Line, you built a bad boat. It didn’t work out, that’s on you honey.”  Jack Dawson: “I don’t know about you, but I intend to write a strongly worded letter to the White Star Line about all of this.”   They were both in agreement that it wasn’t the iceberg’s fault.
They really need to have a follow up interview with the iceberg and the water so they can hash it out LOL
My Oprah
Genius
1.9 Thousand Poeple Said: "Too Soon"
This is literally the best sketch in 4 years fight me
This has got to be one of the funniest comedy skits on Saturday Night Live
he’s right, someone needs to make a movie about this.
Hysterical
This isn’t funny.
I like when he says "so much you.... can't see"
Where is the funny part??
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Iceberg is like, "Chill."
Of course the iceberg is the victim.
"I turned around and half my arse is gone!!" lol! One of many great lines in this sketch. Hilarious!
3:10 I think he almost broke lol I love this skit sm!
“ Nobody is cancelling the ocean”
"Oh my god, okay, wow, okay, fine, you wanna do this? let's do this..first of all, you came to where I LIVE AND YOU HIT ME"
Is it weird that I want to be best friends with this iceberg?
😅😅😅😅
This skit needs to be in the television hall of fame
“That’s not my name!”
I think the moral of that story is,people may have made it to wherever it is they were going if maybe there was enough ocean to actually see icebergs as tall as that ship as seen in the clip of the footage taken that fateful northern Atlantic night.
I'm surprised that it hasn't melted bc of climate change
Still waiting to buy the album called "Music" by Mr. Iceberg
I love those low key dad jokes Bowen was delivering.
This is the funniest thing I have ever seen. I have been watching it every day for over 6 months now. I have a couple of friends who match this persona to a T.
Best line in this? Not sure but it definitely wasn't the White Star Line.
Titanic is mad
Yeah it called mu*scofs*sic
Thank you for that... question
Titanic: *Hits the iceberg Iceberg: *sad iceberg noises
This guy is incredible.
Cannot stop watching this, makes me laugh so much 😂😂😂❤️❤️
A lot of the comments on here seem just a little too sweet and syrupy and way more complimentary than the piece deserves. It looks like some of these commenters are paid to say these things. The skit was funny enough, but, Emmy nomination? Really?
is this the best snl bit ever?!?! yes
cultural reset
petition for Bowen Yang to actually record a song called "Lover Boy" becasue its a fucking bop-
White star line u built a bad..boat ..that's on you honey...
He is my favorite new cast member always hilarious!!! Your were supposed to be my Oprah Colin!!!
I swear I have never laughed so hard  he is a master!!
Is no one talking about the sequins that look like nipples?? 🤣
Hold my hand in your brand new house 😂
As a huge history buff for the 1912 sinking of the Titanic, this just absolutely tickles me at how random it is, love it <3
Gay
“Half my ass is gone..”
This is one of my top 5 all time favourite sketches🏆  (Irish cacophony... 🤣🤣🤣)
kudos to Bowen on being bumped up to the regular cast member, so happy for the show tonight. Bollacks. Lynn
i love how the number of deaths becomes lower and lower as the Iceberg becomes more emotional
I have been watching SNL since the 1970's and this skit is top 10. Bowen Yang is gold.
At 4:18 does Michael Che say "I'm Eric Sanders goodnight" with a cough at the end? Or am i just high
If the iceberg had a good publicist they would push him to become a climate change activist.
Need lip readers, what did Colin say to Bowen, and what was his response at the end of the segment???
Iconic  Can’t get this skit out of my mind so funny
😒 so 100 years from now is there going to be an snl skit on airplanes in 2001??
Bowen was so awesome in this skit  :D
So glad Bowen Yang got promoted. No one can reach this same energy level that he can in sketches like these
"I've done a lot of...reflecting"
Now he needs to reach back into the past again and give another catastrophe a comedic spin, like Mount St. Helens: God's punishment or the Devil's blowhole?
“And before I turn around- and go “what?”  😂 I’m just picturing an iceberg turning around 😭
Beck is funny. You aren’t.
Why does bowen yang give off Bjork vibes in this video
Bowen was robbed. He should have been awarded that Emmy.
I didn't laugh at any of his jokes (although the part were Yang said "Stop attacking me" made me smirk a little) I was actually pretty moved. Tbh I feel like he should've been a host more than a cast member
I don't know why Colin laughed when Iceberg mentioned the title of his album. Madonna had an album titled Music.
Wouldn't the actual iceberg have melted by now?  This iceberg is an imposter just trying to get some sort of fame or compensation.
Is he wearing "ice face"?
"Nobody's cancelling the ocean".  Yeah, like gravity is off the hook in plane crashes.
When in need of cheering up - this is perfect. Every time.
That was epic.
“wat was going through your head” the titanic
Saying the iceberg sank the Titanic is like saying the ground crashed the plane.
The little “Did you like my song?” after the mics cut is so cute ☺️
He, like, overacts and, like, tries so hard to be funny. But I just don't think he is. The one genuinely funny moment was at 1:18 -- which was off script.  I think Colin is much funnier in this than Bowen, imho.
They have a great chance of bringing this character back with that iceberg at the titanic museum falling on people. ⛳ 👏
Why does this short give me these 2008 vibes? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8A5IbXCLKhs
Feeling like an I Don't Think So Honey segment on SNL
How dare he do blue face! As a smurf I am highly offended by this outrage(this is a joke)
An iceberg gaslighting America... an iceberg deflecting...genius.
😂 LMAO
Not funny I tried
His delivery was perfect.
Bowen Yang is a national treasure.
15th April 1912.... some weird ass facts get in your brain hole sometimes... great for a pub quiz but serves no purpose it’s not like someone is gonna hold me at gunpoint and say “gimmi the date or I’ll shoot...blame the binoculars one more time lady”
Full Riverdance!💪😂😂
That icebreg said "I don't think so hunny!!"
You have an album called music? 😂😂😂😂
Ps...LOVE THE OUTFIT!!!
Does the WATER get a chance to make it's case?? It be a funny sketch.
I watched this sketch a bunch of times...it still funny!!
He deserves an Emmy for this original hilarious sketch!!
I'm a titanic freak but after this sketch somehow I feel for the iceberg...he is right...THEY HIT HIM!!! I CAN SEE THE ICEBERG FLOATING PAST N AWAY FROM THE TITANIC SATING ...U HIT ME!!!
First time seeing this…and it’s amazing!!!
Me the entire time 😐
This could possibly one of my favorite SNL moments
YOUR GETTING SHUT DOWN
Who’s gonna tell him that icebergs are made of water, it’s not gonna be me
I mean, he has a point about the water.
My biggest flex is that Bowen Yang graduated from my high school 😌
"forty or fifty people died or whatever'   -LMFAO
This is hilarious
so chilly
I would like to hear the Titanic's side of the story
This is already an all-time SNL classic. Brilliance in every sentence
Leonardo Dicaprio has since said that he regrets partaking in a film that demonizes icebergs (representation matters!), and he is now a huge advocate for them.
Bowen killed it in this one. My favorite part was the "Irish cacophony."
This man is amazing lmao
“whY ARE YOU ATTACCKING MEEEEE?!” Is the most underrated part of this whole sketch
Petition for "The Water that Drowned the people on Titanic" to come to Weekend Update. I need some drama
Hold my hand in your brand new house? Lol
“ Nobody is cancelling the ocean.” Best line
The only thing that messes up this skit is that Colin depends so much on the prompter that he’s not looking at the Iceberg
I'm getting so many David Rose vibes its insane
I keep watching this and loving something new- right now, my favorite part is the "white starline, you built a bad boat- it didn't work out"
#icebergdidnothingwrong
i think more people died of hypothermia than drowning. so even if the iceberg wasn't fully responsible you can't deny they were part of the climate that created the problem
so good
I am still awaiting for the oficial MV for lover boy, pls drop one Iceberg
I always rewatch this like literally so good
this is brilliant
I’ve watched this many times and it stays hilarious 😂
This is not funny how the hell you gonna make fun of what to the titanic
I was just chilling.
So they put Bowen in white face and nobody cares? If he was a fault line that split in the July 4, 2019 earthquake and painted his face black, he'd be canceled...
yeah!! Bowen ...when are you coming back from hiatus! Lynn
I guess I'm officially old and out of touch, because I thought this was horrible. Didn't laugh once.
This feels like a YouTube apology video😩
I guess in 100 years people will be making fun of 9/11. I didn’t find this funny at all…
The iceberg: “I enjoyed floating through the ocean, watching the water.”
This is probably an all time bit from snl, will stand the test of time. Give yang the emmy
This is really brilliant.
Did the iceberg have to be gay?
y’all are too easy
I love that YouTube is providing context to jokes that are based in fact. The history lessons have to come from somewhere.
One of THE BEST SNL skits ever!!!😂
I need to hear the whole ice berg album.
One of the bests !!!!!
Thank you...👀👀for that.....👀👀👀 questionnnnnn.....👀👀👀👀👀
They pulled this one off!  👊🤣x3
This is chef’s kiss 😗🤌
At the end you can see Colin giving a very enthusiastic ‘I liked it’
Bowen Yang better win an Emmy for this
I'm here to get my daily dose of the flamboyant iceberg.
I’m very interested in the reasons why ANYONE gave a thumbs down.
"They DROWNED, BITCH; that's not meeee...!"
I've probably watched this 50 times and it gets better each watch
I can’t believe how many times I’ve come back to this
So the iceberg was gay?
I couldn't help but busy up laughing.
Smls twin brother
I love this, I do. But I wonder how The Iceberg will feel if he finds out that Madonna had an album from 2000 called "Music."
I’ve watched this at least 10 times… funny as hell!!!! Whoever thought this up is genius!!!!
Anyone else want a full album release from the iceburg that sounded better than 99% of the music out there now 😂
It's still bizarre to me that the company that built the Titanic built 2 exact replicas of the ship before it, both of which also sank, and everyone was like "yeah I'll get on that; It can't happen three times in a row right?"
God, SNL sucks today.
One of the best sketches ever!
bowen yang is a star
This is so ridiculous, I love whoever comes up with these random ass skits 😂
Who else is here after the Iceberg attack in Tennessee  @ The Titanic Museum?  Guess he’s done reflecting.
Do people actually think this is funny…
This is the least funny sketch ive ever seen
I just came back to watch this it's so good
Do people actually think this is funny? I thought this comment section was a joke at first you people are deranged
This might be the worst skit ever
The funniest part of this sketch is the fact that people actually like it
What did the autopsy say? They iceberged? No they drowned Bitch!
Does he really have to use that gay voice in every sketch Kate is way better than him
lmao
Best!
This reminds me of the TanaCon guy who went on Dr Phil. I almost thought it was the inspiration for this until I realized the Dr Phil episode came out later.
if you downvoted this.. i don't like you.
Too soon.
Okay you wanna do this? Fine. Okay yoU CAME TO WHERE I LIVE AND YOU HIT MEEEAAAHHH…!!???
They drowned bitch!! Brilliant 😂
why is it ok to make fun of the titanic but not 9/11
What did the autopsy say, they icebergded? No, they drowned, bitch! 😂😂
The quack success postmeiotically bubble because cupcake intuitively prevent within a wealthy married. minor, quizzical canvas
I C O N I C
The iceberg is talking straight facts, Great work Saturday Night Live.
I watch this at least once or twice a week to improve my mental health.
This is one of the best skits ever, I can't stop watching it, and Bowen is incredible!
One of their funniest ever. Holds up to repeated viewings. Srsly.
Great idea maybe next SNL should do an interview with the planes that hit the towers
That blazer is fuckin sick
This was great!!!!
I'm here...to promote...my album
You can tell Colin knows this is funny but he's not exactly sure why...
Hands down: Bowen as the iceberg is one of the funniest SNL bits in the last 4 years.
Ive watched this so much that Ive begun to unironically want Lover Boy on spotify
I absolutely love this whole bit.  Bowen Yang is beyond amazing.
The fact that this is what SNL has become… and this shit sells? Maybe I should try a career in comedy 😂
Oh my god, Okay, wow.... Fine! You want to do this...?  Okay, let's Do This!!!!! You Came where I live and hit me! I was just chillin, I turn around and half my Ass was gone!!!!
How could over 1K people not like this??
Holy token Batman.  I'm trying to give this hack a chance but he's not making it very easy.
Your boys speaking facts
Bowen is incredible
WTAF!? Why can't I quit this video?
I have to watch this at least once per week in order to feel normal.
Too soon?
This is a classic skit! Right up there with the Pepsi syndrome
This is every talk-show guest whose experienced some controversy and doesn't want to bring it up, wrapped inside a over-the-top absurdist premise, with a huge dose of catty queen realness. It's hilarious.  Bowen almost breaks right before he mentions cancelling the ocean.
OMG he is wearing Joey Tribbiani´s Ichiban lipstick for men!!!
go collect that Emmy and make snl histor, you deserve it
"...that's not my name."
Excuse you that is Emmy nominee Bowen Yang
WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING ME?????!!!!😂😂
These are not the questions we discussed!😂😂
I can watch this over and over again, and NEVER stop laughing!!!! LOLOLOLOL
Should've made a joke about being half-water as his race lol.
This should be as iconic as Tom Hanks' David Pumpkins.
I love his facial makeup! The blue lips adds just the right touch.  Emmy for costume!
They icebergded
Congrats to Bowen Yang on his Emmy nomination.
SO offensive!!
Im sorry, this just was not funny.  Not live,  not on here.
Come back to this every week.
I may have watched this too many times but... I feel like there's some powerful political subtext... 🤔
Bowen Yang is nominated for an Emmy and I'm pretty sure this is the skit that did it
Hey! They may want to call this Critical Iceberg Race Theory 😂🤣!
The costume is funny, but the character is a “Stefan” knockoff... The Emmys should’ve been “inclusive” by nominating someone who’s Funny
And now he’s nominated for an Emmy❤️
Bowen Yang just got nominated for an Emmy and I think this skit proves he is one of SNLs best right now
“This is always a really weird time of year for me.” Like North Atlantic icebergs in mid-April… this skit works on so many levels
I just still can’t get over his break at 1.22
For some reason i saw the thumbnail for this when it came out and didnt really bother to watch. Saw it for the first time after Cecilys IG post about the nominations. Wasted a lot of time not seeing this.
I immediately thought of this sketch when I saw he was nominated for an Emmy. Such an unexpectedly hilarious bit
Justice for the Iceberg!
"But Nobody is cancelling THE OCEAN" 🌊💦
What does having an early lunch 🥙 have to do with it? Is that a reference to bottoming since the iceberg is a gay man?
Emmy nominations, congrats!!
Why did they make this?
First Chinese American man to be nominated in an acting category. Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series Bowen Yang, _Saturday Night Live_ I've waited 45 years for this.
Can we see more of the Iceberg's story? I want to know his real name, about his background, if he has grown his butt back, etc? 😆
OMG'NESS THIS IS HILARIOUS🤣🤣🤣🤣
So Demi Lovato....
Instant Classic.
The emmy noms sent me here. Bowen is next level funny. He's taking it home.
This needs to be the new "After We Collided" fanfiction.
Congratulations Bowen Yang on your Emmy nomination! You are amazing!
EMMY
Who's here to rewatch this after Bowen's Emmy nom?
EMMY NOMINEE BOWEN YANG!!!
I watch this once a week
This is the reason why he was nominated for an Emmy.
he deserves the emmy for this
Bowen Yang just got nominated for an Emmy and I think this sketch definitely helped that happen!
CONGRATS ON THE EMMY NOM, BOWEN!!!
EMMY-NOMINATED BOWEN YANG, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
And he got nominated for an Emmy!!
"twelve tracks, no skips sweartogods" is stuck in my brain now
Congratulations on your Emmy Nomination!! Funny Stuff!
He just got the emmy nom!!!!!
There's much subtle greatness in here. "They drowned, bitch" was masterful and I can't explain why.
EMMY NOMINATED BOWEN YANG I KNOW THAT'S RIGHT
Emmy nominated Bowen Yang!!
I think that iceberg would be water now
This one performance needs a Grammy. Sheer genius. I've watched this 3 times and will be back for more.
"they drowned bitch"  This line is ICONIC
Y'all, the iceberg was dead serious the victim...👀👀
I had an early lunch but I'm hungry for you.
I was like OMG...they’re gonna make a movie about this.
This is just a festival of quotable moments
Best original character in a long time, and from an unexpected cast member.
1.7k people who disliked this video are descendants of titanic or whatever.
This man is fantastic, I can't wait to see more of him.... and Ego
"What did the autopsy say? They were iceberg-ed? No! They DROWNED, BITCH!"
“They drowned, bitch!” 🤣🤣🤣
THE CANNED LAUGHTER IS  .A W F U L. I love this bit but the phony laughter just absolutely ruins it.
SOMEONE PLEASE COME UP WITH ANOTHER DISASTER SO BOWEN CAN PLAY IT NEXT SEASON
We get it Bowen Yang is gay….
Iceberg standing its ground!
Bowen should win an Emmy for this performance!
I seriously don't get why people find this guy the least bit funny. He's Andy Dick, but a hundredth as entertaining.
When iceberg makes better speech than titanic 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING ME!!
I cannot get enough of this one!  This flick is mostly at "I Love Lucy" level .  Imma watch it again; and then, Imma watch it over and over again. Awesome job, SNL 🤣👍
This sketch skewers EDM almost automatically, as an afterthought.  "Loverboy" is a good example of the iceberg being implacably self-centered.
The way he says he's not here to talk about "the sinking" and the look on his face makes me giggle everytime.
“We’re here to talk about my ALBUM”
It’s the fact that no one is talking about how good the song is 😂😂
One of the best bits on SNL for the year.  Love hearing the laughter...
I use this sketch as therapy now.
“old people are spooning on the bed ready to die” 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Someone clever want to do a mash up of "every Bowen ever" ? Bowen is so amazing!!
This sketch alone should win Bowen Yang an award, awesome sketch, good materials, Yang’s delivery of each line and Jost’s complimenting Yang, can not be done any better! Bravo!
Meh.
bro i love this. Ive watched this at least 10x
U
I love how they both break character at 1:20 after he says 'music' 😅
they didn't drown, they froze to death
“THEY DROWNED BIIITCH, That’s not meee that’s WATEEERR" *SCREAMING😭
'First of all, you came to where I live and hit me!'   He's got a point
Wonderfully camp iceberg! 🤣
"They didn't iceberged, they DROWNED!"  LOL
This sketch could have flopped so easily... Bowen is so under utilized
❄️Come on over and kiss me boy, hold my hand in your brand new house  I know you don’t ever want to miss me boy, so let’s watch a movie tonight in your house  Touch me, while the room is spinning Kiss me, let’s go get some dinner Wine me, dine me, I had an early lunch but I’m hungry for you, lover boy💙❄️
If Boy George was an iceberg ❄️💙
So funny. So well written. So well performed. SNL gold. How nice is it to laugh your ass off about some thing that isn’t political or about Covid?
This was the best sketch of the season. A true gem!
*"They drowned, bitch! That's not me, that's WAT-UUH!!"* 😂
SNL IS DEAD
I can watch this all the time
The nostrils flaring glares Bowen throws at Colin are too glorious😂😂😂  Added note: That outfit totally needs to be put in the Smithsonian.
the titanic was a double. there were three men who were killed on that ship that wanted to stop the federal reserve
We needed Bowen in the cast. He’s a fantastic addition.
No, but water needs to come and share their side of the story
I adore you!
So funny.  I love Bowen.  Super!!
I always come back to this
He sounded like Meghan McCain speaking 🙊
I have to watch this about 5 times a week. This is so epic. When he says "THE WA-TER!!!" I laugh my ass off (which was my best feature by the way)
I do not know how Chen made it through this without completely losing it.
I thought I was gonna hate this but bravo lol
“It’s 12 tracks...no skips, swear to God.” And then the ice man performs a DEFINITE skip.
It's 3am and I woke up with the strong desire to watch this.  So here I am!!! I laugh so much with this!!!! And am I sleepy drunk or this totally could be a cool song???
One of the Best skits!!!!!!!!
They Need to make the ICEBERG a recurring character!! This was hilarious!!!
The first costume party I am invited. I will be dressing as this iceberg
This is just hilarious ! so like 40 or 50 people die, it was 1,500, STOP ATTACKING ME! There's so many great lines.
This sketch had everything!
The hidden Madonna and Mariah references in this are gay culture. ✨
this is one of the funniest skits they’ve ever done
Love, LOVE this!!!!!😹😹😹
This is literally one of the most hilarious things snl has ever come up with 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️⚰️
This is wonderful
Plot Twist: The hit song 'LoverBoy' is actually about sinking the Titanic ON PURPOSE! 'Come on over and kiss me, Boy'- He's beckoning the ship closer.../ ''Hold my hand in your brand new house'- The Titanic was brand new and on her maiden voyage/  'I know you don't want to miss me, Boy' He knew that boat was going to tap his a$$! 'Let's watch a movie in your brand new house'- And he knew they'd make a movie about it! 'Touch me and the room is spinning'- The people and furniture spinning and flipping over after the impact 'Kiss me while we eat some dinner/ Wine me/ Dine me' He really was jealous of the parties the people were having on the ship, that's why he lured them to their doom 'I had an early lunch but I'm hungry for youuuuuu..." See, he wanted to devour and destroy that boat! And the 12 tracks, no skips are for the 12 or so people who lost their lives or whatever... But you go Iceberg! We see you!
You built a bad boat!!!!!
One day we will realize the brilliance of this generation of SNL writers...they are really good
This is the best character I've seen on this show in a while!
This gets better every time I watch it....🤣
this was one of the best skits this season
How he kept a staght face throughout this whole sketch, I will ever know! This is SO f***-in' funny! Such a simple idea, but masterfully done!.... "they drowned, B***ch! That's not me; that's wa-ter!'  is just classic!
Best argument 🤣🤣🤣🤣👁️👄👁️
“No skips, swaretogod” makes me laugh harder every time I see this clip haha
0:06, 0:46, 1:06-1:16, 1:36, 2:00, 2:16, 2:31, 2:51, 3:03, 3:24, 3:30
He needs to release the full version of that song!!
Not gonna lie, “Lover boy” has potential 🤣🤣
Maybe the iceberg should let it go and rise like the break of dawn?❄😝  Am I the only one that just found a great Halloween costume for later this year? Now, my question is if Bowen was wearing Ichiban or Coral Blue number 2 lipstick?
I'm here watching this again 💀
He is amazing and this is an immediate SNL classic! I’ve watched it like 5 times already lol. So excited to see more of Bowen Yang next season!!!!!
It’s like Kamala being asked about the border.
So glad I finally watched this!
OMG! Is he actually wearing 'iceface'?! On behalf of the frozen water community - so offended. Is this what we're teaching our little icecubes is acceptable? As if icebergs didn't have enough to deal with already. This is breaking me apart. I can't believe this, I'm done. Just melt me now.
Mewsiq
Gold!
So stupid they running out of stuff to do
This is a good skit
Ericka Jane!!
Bowen Yang you ROCK!!!!
We need a part two.
bowen yang is amazing
Are you sure Iceberg isn't spelled Eissberg?
I think this is my tenth time watching this. I just randomly watch it.
I want a full version of that song.😂
Here I am again 😂😂😂, kind of obsessed 😂😂😂😂
best current cast member period
A star is born with this sketch.
This is an iconic sketch! Bowen is perfect!! Never tire of watching it! I wonder if we’ll ever find out the iceberg’s real name?
That shout out to Earl Simmons is the best part of this skit...
The invincible ball definitely squeeze because brandy disappointedly hop plus a instinctive lentil. sweltering, hushed perch
One of my favorite SNL skits of all time. "No one is talking about... THE WATER!"
Heyyyyyyyyy White Star Line YOU BUILT A BAAAAAD BOAT I CAN'T LOL
BEST. SKIT. EVER.
brilliant  for so many reasons
Don't show this to Belfast
snl sinks to a new low
An iceberg that has a publicist!! Giggling out of control!
Watched: June 2nd, 2021  I'm never gonna stop rewatching this
That headpiece is a work of art.👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
https://youtu.be/R2AMq6Nclg8
😆😆😆
Did anyone else notice the similarities between the spin of the iceberg and the Republicans party's spin of January 6?
How did he keep a straight face?  My face would have been DROWNING in tears.
personally, this cemented Mr. Yang into one of my favourites. Finally a gay man on SNL I can identify with! Thank you to whoever casted him!!!!!!
Dana Carvey: Choppin' Broccoli  Chris Farley: Chippendales Bowen Yang: The Iceberg That Sank The Titanic
this is what every youtube apology video sounds like
I am obsessed with this clip, Bowen is amazing.. his expressions! Love it!!
White Star Line, you built a bad boat.  That's on you, honey.
1:20 "MUSIC" *insert giggle here
I feel like this iceberg! People always fuck themselves up then look to blame me cause I wouldn’t put up with their bs!
:) This is so 2021 AND so 1912!
god Bowen Yang is SO good
HAAAHAHA!!
Lynn here, Bowen you have great comments on The Christmas w/ Scarlatte Johansson. Andrew Yang is on for running mayor of NYC, get ready for your parody.
Yup....I rewatched again......sue me !!
Dude is hilarious best cast member In a while! He will go far I like his mean gay attitude it cracks me up.
Bowen is a star
I love how Bowen is soooo in character, but almost breaks when he has to repeat the name of his new album, "Music."
The views constantly rising on this clip 📈📈
I don’t understand the skit. What’s the joke or gag?
I don’t know how many times I’ve rewatched this...
ROFL 🤣 I choked on my drink
This man is a revelation
I need a whole version of "Lover boy" and a music video. Please make it happen.
Ok...no...these are not the questions we discussed...
It's nice seeing SNL taking more risks and being more weird-funny in their skits lately!
I need a full version of Lover boy and a music video... Someone make it happen
Irish cacophony
This segment was incredibly smart and wildly creative. Esp given how long ago the sinking happened— like how many fresh new takes can one have in a 100+ year-story? S/o to the costume dept and to Bowen!
I really hoped he would talk about how he gets attacked for killing Jack though Jack was a fictional character.
AWESOME PERFORMANCE!! I love the viewpoint from the iceberg! 💯🤩👍👏👏👏👏👏
I watch this EVERY day....this and Orbit the Astros' mascot dancing to Single Ladies by Beyonce 🤣👍🏾
I can't stop watching this, lol
So funny. Gets better every time I watch it
Hilarious
I can't stop watching this when it comes up, lol, well done!!😁
This is pretty genius.  :D
bowen yang is AMAZINGGGG
Why does the iceberg look like Molly Brown?
From Loverboy to Coverboy
This guy can deliver.
Yeah, it's called M U S I C
Easily one of SNL’s top 10...
This is gold
I really don't know how Colin didn't break out laughing ... This was epic outstanding!! Just brilliant Mr. Bowen, brilliant:. They drowned, bitch !
Did Che say “I’m Ronald Simmons, goodnight”?
(feat. Ever Given)
Bowen better be a repertory player next season. He's hysterical.
this gay is setting back asians 100 years of societal progress
Ive literally watched this 14 times and it never gets old.
Happy Sunday! Kudos to Bowen, you are having a moment.
The acid tuna neuropathologically trip because birth paradoxically balance failing a medical gum. xenophobic, spectacular furniture
What does Micheal Che say at the very end? I can’t understand him and the subtitles couldn’t catch it
I choked at: "They drowned bitch!"
Omg he channels white apologizer SO WELL
Oh sweet Mary Mother of Christ! That was the hardest I've EVER laughed at ANYTHING in my life! (Well, except the Robin Williams special from the early Aughts...) Bowen Yang is a comedic genius, and I think SNL will be the first on a long, long line of fantastic credits in years to come. "Irish Cacophony" - I mean, come ON!
One of the best bits I have ever seen, Coolio.
So awesome!!
i can't figure out what this is really about- does anyone know the actual context?
For those wondering, I read their lips at the end and Bowen told Collin "What do you think about the song?" to which Collin answered "It's nice!"
We don't deserve Bowen
A gay iceberg?? 🤣
This is cool because it is painfully unfunny but everyone seems to like it so you question reality.
Emmy
Nobody is canceling the oceannnnnn!!!!
Just like celebrities. Hilarious 😂
The obtainable dead geographically drain because joke chronologically explain toward a hesitant norwegian. labored, scintillating psychology
Can The Iceberg return to give its take on global warming as a glacial correspondent?
Iconic Iceberg, speak your truth!!
A star is born
Four SNL skits I watched over and over again are: 1.) David S. Pumpkins, 2.) The Real Housewives of Disney  3.) Beauty and the Beast, 4.) Now the Iceberg from Titanic.   Pure comedic art.
The iceberg makes a good case here. The Titanic is basically a story about how a giant boat assaulted an innocent ice mass and it backfired.
Thank you YouTube for adding a context link to Titanic in the Encyclopedia Britannica. I really needed the other side of the story
Well, someone di-idda.
I LOVE THIS MAN. Literally the funnest human on earth. And I dony even like SNL like this, but I m so happy about this. It keeps cycling through my feed. I m so happy about it
"It was midnight, I was chilling "😂
"First of all you came to where I live and you hit ME" always gets me everytime
I want a yearly update on the ice berg
"Yeah, it's called mHUSic"
Epic!
Been binging Bowen's content on SNL and this sketch is PURE GENIUS! I think he was also able to capture how influencers do their apologies these days hahahah
Bowen yang is my favorite cast member. Period. Lmfao
I hope he keeps the hat. This sketch is destined to become historic.
So stupid, it's brilliant.
This was brilliant
just caught the DMX tribute at the end - RIP
Sooooo good 👏👏👏👏
What the...
Sometimes,  I go about my day normally, and then BAM! out of nowhere my brain goes "COME ON OVER AND KISS ME BOY, HOLD MY HAND IN YOUR BRAND NEW HOUSE....' 😅😅😅
I need to stop watching this video
After watching this it does change the way you watch Titanic
"Why are you AtTaCkInG me!!!!!"
this is going to be one of those iconic sketches
Oh shit...
I keep coming back to damn funny
Rip
“They drowned bitch!”
I'd buy the Iceberg's album. Bowen Yang is brilliant!
Did the woke-brigade cancel the ocean yet? /sarc
First off, you came where I live and hit me😂🤣😅
"Its like hey white starline. Ya built a bad boat."
Of course the iceberg is gay. Of course!
🤣😂🤣😂
Bowen needs his own repeating character on weekend update. He could be the next stefon
Lol I'm back here for the millionth time. Omg the bestest
Ok … NO. These are not the questions we discussed.
The is a great example of SNL not being funny anymore
First time ever ,  that it makes me smile to see the views go up and up.  I am glad  your being appreciated.   You both played off each other so well..
Half my ass was gone ...
"half my ass is gone!"
I’m from the town which was the titanic’s last port of call and I’m in absolute stitches. 😂😂😂😂
Nah, bruh.
Next victim : the goose that got into Sully’s airplane over the Hudson😂😂😂👍🏾
‘Nobody is talking about the water’ 😂😂😂😂
The classy stem ordinarily undress because oatmeal ultrasonographically ski forenenst a unhealthy war. thankful, unbiased helicopter
I think I’ve watched this once every week since it came out. 🤣
He can really sing, too.
Kind of scary, actually
People give this video much more credit than it actually deserves. Sheesh.
The large half-brother intriguingly mate because cost jekely handle until a rich weeder. wrathful, ripe hall
2:24 Comedic Gold
Ya know looking at it from the icebergs perspective,  I realized how horribly maligned, slandered, and mistreated he has been!  Think about it, ya'll, he needs to lawyer up, and file charges for assault!  He has a case!  Free the iceberg!
What does Michael say at the end?
The writers better be sitting at their desks thinking about more iceberg jokes. There will be unrest until it becomes a recurring segment. They better not give us the cold shoulder.
"No one's cancelling the ocean!" LOLOLOL
So Funny 😁
Love that song. So 80's it should be on MTV.
Hilarious!!!!
Glad they let the iceberg speak his truth 😌
This is like the 10th time I’ve watched this 😂😂 EPIC
Best snl skit in awhile!  😍😍😍
This is always a hard time of year for me, Colin.
Return character idea.  Iceberg bumps into the Atlantic ocean who confronts Iceberg about him trying to blame AO for the Titanic.  Or AO takes Iceberg to court for defamation.
It's really in bad taste to minimize that terrible tragedy. But that's SNL.
This is actually the best video I’ve ever watched😂 I think I am responsible for at least 1000 views here
Are we not going to talk about the fact that the iceberg is shaped like Kathy Bates' big hat?
"YeAh ItS cAlLeD MuSHIC!!!"  Colin : 😶💀
From the single “no” on the medieval times skit, knew this guy was gonna be a star.
You can see that the ass is missing on the iceberg headpiece 🤣☠️👏🏼
Loverboy is a bop tbh
EMMY AWARD
I miss leslie jonees on weekends update="
" You came to where I live ", for some reason I always crack up at that part,LOL.
So funny x
"Wine me, dine me I had an early lunch, but I'm hungry for youuu lover boy!"
Thats the greatest bit of all time
2.9 million views
WHAT WAS SNL EVEN LIKE BEFORE HIM
I realize this is a bit that they can only really do once a year, but.... I want more.
no skips!!! hes so funny
This is ridiculous
I need a full length version of Loverboy.
I don't get why this went viral. It's not very funny and it's basically Stafon as an iceberg. Comedy is dead, especially on SNL.
He is SO GOOD!!!!
"And I'm literally INJURED and all everybody cared about was 40 or 50 people died or WHATEVEERRR 😒 " 😂😂 I died at that for SURREEE
Did Patti Harrison write Loverboy? 😂😂
"that's not my name!" I was hoping we'd hear what his name is lol. It's probably Cliff.
That entire "Loverboy" chorus lives rent free, all day, everyday in my head. And I'm not even mad about it
I'm going to be a bit of a killjoy here. It's funny but the premise seems weak. Did anyone ever really blame the iceberg for the Titanic disaster? Who would do that? And the skit is disrespectful to the victims and their survivors. But, I agree, the comic is very funny.
I have to watch this once a day, at least 😅
This is the 5th time Im coming back to this! It gets better every time!!!! :D
funniest thing ive seen in a looong time on snl, brilliant writers and for this skit!!
Actually so true tho
I watch this skit several times a week.. It gets funnier and funnier EVERY TIME!! 🤣😂
Would like to see a 9/11 version of this where the Twin Towers play the victims.
My literal biggest obsession meets my other obsession and i can't be happier
I wonder how families that are related to those who died on the Titanic feel about this "comedy skit" personally I never have found the death of another human being very humorous.  Whats next SNL/Bowen Yang doing a comedy skit about "The Showers" or "The Ovens" at a NAZI concentration camp or maybe the "Raping of Nanking" or the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami
When he said "I was chilling, then..." the tone in which he said reminded me of The End of Ze World video about nuclear war.
What’s his name? Darryl!
Was it a missed opportunity for Bowen not to say “the Titanic” when Colin asked him “what was going through your head that fateful night?”
I was CHILLING.
Where can I buy that album though?
Bowen Yang is such a great talent for this show to find.
Can we please talk about my album    Sure or Shore?  The writers miss that!
The chemical appeal broadly report because letter comparably fry despite a astonishing digger. hypnotic, jealous adult
This right here is funjy
This is the funniest SNL skit I’ve ever seen. Every single part of it 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yeah it’s called music   🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cowbells, landsharks and Icebergs...lol the song is stuck in my head now...:)
Um………..ok.
"The WAATERRR‼️" 😂🤣😂🤣
It's the 'Irish cacophony' for me...☠️🔥☠️🔥☠️
imagine if this was played in the snatch game on rupaul's drag race
This is one of the worst ideas for comedy ever, but the writers and actor made it comedy gold.
As an Irish descendant, I love the use of the word cacophony 😂😂
gay people all have the same sense of humor: suck
Best ever.
He is so Funny there are episodes that he has done. Have u every laugh so hard u get nauseated/dizzy. One of the best SNL.
Flaming iceberg is funny!
This is not funny
They really put a Context card on the video 😂
I guess the iceberg is just a fragile snowflake!
Classic SNL. This will forever go down in the chronicles of historic sketches. Bowen Yang is an outstanding performer. Black Widow's live-in boyfriend was also there. And Michael Che, I guess? End of comment.
HaHaHa!!! Poor Iceberg has a point!!! Hahaha!!!
Love at first sight😍🌎
I thought this was a comedy skit. Maybe the funny part got cut out.
“Oh my God. They are going to make a movie about this.” LOL
What was going through your head that night?  Omg 🤣🤣🤣
"That's not me, that's water"
He is so funny!!
We need a follow up interview with the water!!!
He is so good in Nora from Queens, too !  Such a talent!
Damn. I'm going to have to start watching SNL again for the first time in forever.  Thanks Bowen Yang!
I’ve watched this about 300 times and love it every time
So funny.
SO GOOD
How far the comedy has fallen from this show… wtf is this
I can't stop watching this 👁👁
Great idea for a skit! I felt like it started out a little shaky, but once he got into explaining what happened and defending himself, it turned brilliant pretty quickly!
This is the funniest ive seen on snl in a while
The way his expression immediately sours at 0:46 😂😂😂
Genius.
The iceberg is soooo ice cold, just bitter! 😉
I'm LITERALLY injured but all anybody cares about is like 40 or 50 people died or whatever..."  "...I said Oh, I'm sorry which is INSANE!"
Why am I back here!!!??? Next is the Mine skit with RuPaul for the 4926939677 time.
lol @ "What was going through your head that fateful night?"
irish cacophony and full on river dance are underappreciated
"Half my ass is gone...which WAS my best feature."  Genius!
This is brilliant
It’s 12 tracks. No skips. Swear to god...
No one is canceling the Ocean lol! I think the Ocean is out to cancel us lol!
So brilliant! Everything!
How buzzed was Che?
I am watching this now for, like, the fifth or sixth time. It never gets old.
“And the old people are like spooning on the bed, ready to die”
Racism against Irish People! I am seriously offended! My feelings are hurt and I need my safe place.
"I've done a lot of reflecting to try and move past it."  - Every. Single. Line. Of. This. Sketch. Shimmers. In. The. Moonlight.
LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS!!! BRILLIANT 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
This skit is SO FUNNY. I keep coming back to watch it 😂😂😂😂
I fuxking love this skit!!
SNL needs to add Bowen to the main cast.
“Old people are like spooning on the bed” 😂
This deserves an Emmy. Fantastic writing, and Bowen is perfect.
Without a doubt.....the best sketch of SNL this season! Creative.....funny.....and smart!
This gets better every time I watch it. Bowen is so good.
bowen is actually a gift to us all
Sometimes when I’m sad I just come and watch this video
He was made for this skit!!!!! Omg
Very funny and I like this comedian a lot more after this. But him crying about Elon Musk being host just really annoyed me. Seems like a bit baby.
I had tears
painfully unfunny
real david from schitt's creek vibes and i love it!!
Brilliant. Great interview with Katie Couric. Nuture your comedic genius.Lynn
Bring back Bowen Yang's Iceberg!  Encore!!
Iceberg does make some valid points and can't wait to hear the album, that 1st track is hot
A read a few comments. How is this funny? This guy is by far the least talented person on the cast. Comments must be from people that want him to succeed for something other than humor.
Is it wrong that the iceberg makes a good case here?
It’s the enemy 😠
It's not even hyperpop but it's hyper something
I caught that crack this is so funny
i love the crowd cheering for the iceberg lmao kinda dark
This and the KW Paula Deen sketches are my go-to favorites whenever I need a laugh. They. Work. Every. Time.
Bowen Yang is hilarious 😂
Emmy please!
Bowen Yang is a GIFT to SNL and he needs to be in every single sketch EVER.
Well no lies detected honey 💅
Breath of fresh cold air
Ok but the song kinda goes hard
i need loverboy on spotify
Hahahahahaha
This Iceberg has a real shot at making it in the music industry.
"It's 12 tracks. No skips. Swear to God" is an underrated line.
Anyone else thinking Halloween costume to die for?
The best SNL skit in a very long time!!!!
The high rising terminal (HRT) and "like"s are almost annoying enough to vote Thumbs-down.
Love this so much
“They DROWNED bitch” 😭
BIG Elliott Goss energy. LMAO!
When people ask my me about my favorite character from SNL, I respond “I like the Iceberg that hit the Titanic”. Now I know why they walk away.
Y'know... the iceberg hat is really beautiful.  They did an amazing job on that thing.
Bowen for President.
"You built a bad boat" EPIC....🤣
One of the best I can remember.
this one's moving up on the list of my all-time SNL classics.
HILARIOUS!!!
Wow, that was brilliant.
Of course the iceberg was a really camp gay iceberg 🤣
This is giving me Stefan vibes. AND I'M ALL FOR IT.
I need SNL to drop Iceberg’s album soon!
out of the 2mil views. about 500 views are mine. this is pure gold 😂😂😂😂
Bowen got my attention immediately upon his first appearance on SNL. Now he's getting the great recognition he fully deserves! He is incredibly talented and so FUNNY! 🤣❤💕
Years from now this sketch will be in every complilation of SNL. It is iconic along side Belushi's Samuri, Murphey's Mr Rodgers' Neigborhood and Gumby.
This segment needs to be nominated for an Emmy,
I had no idea there were gay icebergs!
I really hope the song is spelt 'Lover Buoy'.
This is the only snl vid I come to when depressed.
He was born to perform.. peak expert level acting
“They drowned bitch”🙄
oh my god they are going to make a movie out of this...
This is terrible,  snl smh🤦‍♂️
#justicefortheiceberg
Chef’s kiss to the line reading of “You said you’d be my Oprah, Colin”
A masterpiece of a skit. The acting was phenomenal.
it was sunk by the Jesuits the captain and crew were giving poison in they're drinks by a Jesuit Stewardess. i didn't know what a Jesuit was so i had to look it up it is a Roman Cult something or other. This was Hilarious however. lol..
I lose it at "Ya built a bad boat. That's on you, honey" and "Twelve tracks, no skips swear to God."
the way I relate to this iceberg 😭😭✋🏾
I had to come back to this Bc - season highlight for real
I was just in the middle of an "SNL breaking character" marathon, and what do you know the first recommendation on my YouTube is this one with a great character breaking moment!
Holy crap. Cancer is funnier than this garbage. And Irish bashing.  Cool SNL. Fire Julio Torres for writing this Titanic piece of iceberg.
this is my fourth time rewatching this
The best actor I’ve seen in SNL, barely looking at the script. Good job
This is disgusting. 1500 fucking people died
“And they’re playing the violin and...yelling and...the old people are like, spooning on the bed ready to die.” I died at that part!
2:18 "WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING ME?!" Thats me in a nutshell
Who is this queen?
SNL.  Still only funny if you are in 5th grade.  Especially this guy.
People find this funny???????
“You said you would be my Oprah, Colin!” “I never said that.” “Well someone did!!!”
this guy is one of several members of the current cast that totally sucks  too over the top flamboyant
I LOVE this guy!!!! Love him
Wow guys… toon soon.. (sarcasm)
People who quote the video have no personality.
Typical SNL bullshite. How is making fun of 1300 people dead a good idea? 🍀🍀
I have seen this at least a million times. Tis some of the funniest shit SNL has EVER put out. To each their own of course.
The amount of times I have watched this ... i love it!!!
My day is not complete if I don’t watch this a couple dozen times. Same with Pete Davidson and Adam Sandler’s Stuck in the House vid. Both are genius!!
bowen! <3
That was funny AF. I mean ,,, faBuloUs⚡
EMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
happy friday
“Hey, White Starline:  you built a bad boat”.    Hysterical  Judith
Too soon
So this guy gets all butthurt because Elon is on snl, but him making fun of a tragedy that killed families and over 1k people is fine?
Further proof of the total decline of SNL,  just awful. They must hand out cocktails so the audience will laugh at stupid crap like this. SNL is a career death hammer; 95% of their cast members vanish as soon as they get bounced from the show. The last one who made it out alive was Will Ferrell, and that was back when SNL was actually funny, a very long time ago.
Funny???
"They bumped into me, I said "oh I'm sorry"" oh, so he's from the Midwest, too.
I love how the only reason there putting him on more stuff because of asian hate, hes not that funny just akward
this is incredible, Bowen is incredible
Anyone notice how the number of people who died kept dropping? I wonder how many the iceberg would have said if this interview continued. LOL!
This is one of the best skits I’ve ever seeen
I need more iceberg
He’s great
this is my favorite weekend update character!!
I'm absolutely amazed as to how *GOOD* Bowen sang that
One of my most favorites FOREVER! "YOU HIT ME!"  ❤️
I fell like this is a reference to someone specific, I just don't know who..
I rewatch this almost everyday I’m ADDICTED
First Bowen Yang skit that I genuinely think is funny, really funny!
This skit gets funnier every time I watch it - which I do almost every time it pops up in my recommended! Also makes me actually curious to watch more of this Bowen guy on SNL. Hilarious!
I miss when snl was actually funny and didnt need a laugh sign
I just can’t stop watching this!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Bowen is such a gem
Bowen Yang really needs to leave SNL. Dudes just not funny in any scene
Whoever tf wrote THIS skit needs to write everything for SNL. Please have the Iceberg back. He's looking pretty skinny these days... :D
lol I love the faux animosity when he says :   Yeannn its called music..   lol
comedy for people who dont have gay friends
I love how he keeps his shoulders and arms in the shape of an iceberg it’s very subtle but it’s there
I loved this! I admit though, I gasped at the amount of people that died...I din't realize it was that many.
I know you doesn't replace bill Hader or Stefon but bowen yang give me hope his gonna make it big
this was so fucking funny
Brilliant 👏
Who's playing the iceberg?
Why is the Asian guy in White Face?
Why is the iceberg projecting as gay?
Everyone knows an iceberg lol
Bowen is THE BEST!!!
Funniest interview ever.   Can not stop watching it.
Bowen needs super stardom, like, NOW.
Irish cacophony. Lolololol. "I said I'm sorry, which is like.....insane." "Nobody's talking about the WATER!!" EVERY. WORD. IS. PERFECT.
I watch this everyday so at least half a million views are mine.🧊🥶
Im dead=)
I can’t tell if the laugh tracks are apart of the act or they are trying to force me to laugh
I love this lol
"Here to promote my album ...music"😂😂😂😂
I have to watch this atleast once a day 🤣
This is not funny & boarding on lame
Bowen, Kate, Melissa, Michael, Colin. PERIOD.
Gilly and Keeves everybody
Yes, it's a hyper-pop EDM new disco fantasia, it's called "Music" 😂😆😂😆😂😆😂😆😂😆😂😆😂😆😂😆😂😆😂😆 I am dying through this whole thing
This is one of the funniest Weekend Update skits ever on SNL.
Holy shit, this is so far from funny. But what do you expect when you abandon a sense of humor and talent for diversity hires
Bowen Yang - Gay iceberg (range?)
😐😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
"And the old people are just spooning in the bed" lmaoooooooo
Colin... your cute, but i loved your wifey 1'st ☺️
Thank All of U's at SNL 🎀
I think we should all celebrate Iceberg Awareness Day every April 14. | #punchline
Underrated
I watched Minari again, cried again somehow.  I can do more.
Lol 😂 half my ass is gone!
Sweet cheeks🤣
Bowen is definitely the next big SNL star
One of the most wonderful pieces I have ever seen !!!
Lover boy sounds like a Lana del Rey song ngl
Guy is so creative! All his characters are gay Asians. Such range.🙄
🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
This is so much funnier than it should be.
Please tell Elon Musk that any drone that enters my airspace becomes an automatic target, that he can forget about driverless cars, and to pull his head out of the clouds.
Maybe the best SNL sketch ever!
I'm obsessed with Bowen Yang.
Remember when this show used to be funny
Speaking as a Titanicologist's apprentice, this changes everything.
🤣🤣🤣
Too funny! I need more Bowen Yang in my life.
I honestly hate Saturday night live but this is one of the funniest skits ever
The first truly funny SNL number in a long time.  Finally!
Why Musk would appear on such a poor season of this show is beyond me.  Any cast member declining to appear on the upcoming Musk show should be ashamed of themselves.  I personally pledge never to patronize any future vehicle with any of these boycotting cast members.  They should all be wishing they had 1/100 the talent and skill set of Musk.  Phooey on them.

So is the iceberg gay?
So am I wrong for watching this weekly ??......whatever.....I’ll be here next week b!tch
Tacky
Brilliant
he is so not funny
Truly one of the funniest bits EVER on SNL..... He deserved an Emmy for this.
I've watched this 100 times and laugh each time equally.
I'll just say what maybe half the comments have already said: Colin: What was going through your head that fateful night? What the iceberg should have said: A BIG BOAT, COLINNN! I don't know about the rest of you, but sometimes Colin is a bit cold-blooded with interviewees. Very frosty vibes from him...
Hahaha oh my god this is so good!!!
Is this what people think is funny? They have lost the plot.
This is amazingly entertaining. And good acting as weel.
This could be an awesome repeat segment where Bowen personifies some inanimate aspect of a historical disaster. Like the Hydrogen in the Hindenburg and hell I bet he could play the victim of a mass shooting from the guns perspective and just light that up with political satire
This should have way more views and 👍🏾.
I bet 311 loves this sketch. Also "Irish cacophony" made my crackle laugh. Genius.
I was gonna try and quote my best lines but I just loved the whole thing. SO many bits worked into such a short clip. This ROCKED. He is extraordinary. Just like when he did the Chinese minister - WOW - Totally Killed it!!
Who here has watched this sketch multiple times??? ❄🚢😄🚢❄
AMAZING Skit! That WAS all you, Bowen.
So we're just not going to talk about how there was room for 2 on the board
"You said you would be my Oprah, Colin. "I never said that.." "Well, someone did..."  Bwahahahahaha
whoever wrote this skit, is a comedy genius.
Ladies and Gentlemen. Meet the new DAVID S. PUMPKINS!!!
"Why, You attacking Me :( You said You'd Be my Oprah Colin...."! And they Say that I'm literally Injured But no One cares About me
'I don't get it. No I just don't get it'  -Miracle on 34th street
A gay iceberg! Hysterical!
"They drowned bitch"
The 1.4K down thumbs are frigid icebergs.
I have watched SNL literally my entire life over 40 years this is THE BEST SKIT EVER
Any lipreaders in the crowd?  What did Bowen say to Jost at the end after the skit, it looks like "what did you think of my ________",  then Colin laughs and says "I liked it"
It's 12 tracks no skips ...swear to gawd
I haves watched this at least once every day since it was uploaded. “Irish cacophony.”
I just love this guy - brilliant! They bumped into me! He is pure genius.
This is one of the best things snl has done in YEARS
Ok I think I watch this once a day.
"WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING ME!?"
I want a sequel with "The Water" being confronted by the iceberg
"I've done a lot of reflecting" is such an amazing low-key iceberg pun 😂
Thank you for that.... question!
Bowen Yang is hilarious.
I would download Lover Boy on Spotify
I feel like the iceberg and I have the same personality
"wine me, dine me; i had an early lunch but I'm hungry for you, loverboy" poetry
Anyone here waiting for the iceberg and the ocean to hash it out?
I never get tired of this! A new SNL classic has been born!!!
imagine this but leonardo dicaprio as the reporter saying “JACK COULDVE FIT”
This bit never gets old. Bowen Yang is at the top of his comedic game. I'm now on Team Iceberg!
That is funny enough to give me hope for SNL, which I haven't seen in years. I lose it every time he says "Chilling." Love the costume. "I turned around and half my ass is missing!"
"Omg, they're going to make a movie about this." 🙄🤦🏿‍♂️
Absolutely disrespectful after 20 years of research for me .. no red "anti-fouling" paint on the iceberg lmao.
I need the album because I need to hear the full cut of Loverboy NOW!
Actually they also got hypothermia...from the WATER! 💦
Iceberg trauma... there therapy for that?
The best yet
*When they give the one-liner sidekick some character depth*
What cracks me up is the idea of Bowen Yang watching some YouTube shit about the Titanic in the middle of the night and coming up with this.
I can’t stop watching this.  It’s just absolute perfection.
This new guy is awesome! LoL
'It was midnight.  I was chilling."  It took me until the third rewatch to get that.  That's on me.
Dude this guy is not funny at all. like not at all.
The real question is: How can SNL insert this character into reoccurring segments instead of a one hit wonder...because this truly is hilarious
I swear if Bowen comes back for the new  season as a "Featuring"  I am done with SNL. It's time for a main cast credit.
Love him!!!
Help me—I cannot stop watching this!
How and why does this have 1k dislikes? lol
ngl ik ppl are gonna hate on me for this, but I cringed so damn hard man idk is it just me????
We need an MV of Loverboy.
LOL, Brilliant sketch by Bowen and the writer!
Wow, I once watched a movie about the sinking of the Tatanic. This is really offensive to me.
*FIRST OF ALL U CAME TO WHERE I LIVE AND U HIT ME*
Every single skit he’s in makes me absolutely die laughing
What did the autopsy say
You came to where i lived and you hit me!  LOL... im on the floor.
Now the ocean should have came out to defend himself
He is so sexy that asian guy
‘What was going through your head that night’ 🤣🤣
Give him an Emmy.
“And I said I’m sorry (which is insane!)” 🤣🤣🤣
If Alexis was an iceberg ... ❄️
Funniest thing I’ve watched in years.
I can't believe I went a whole week without watching this lol
I have shared this and watched this more times than I can count. This is the funniest thing I've seen in ages... so funny!
Bowen Yang is funny in every skit he does.  Fran Lebowitz
Forget weekend update you should be watching what’s going on!
Well I mean... technically it was the titanic that rammed into the ice berg... The Ice burg was just sitting around doing it's thing.
So this is his Emmy clip right?
2.5 Million views and this needs context???
This is incredibly insensitive for those who lost their lives that night, and their families as well.
**first time watching this** Colin: what else would we be talking about? Me: he's going to promote his album Iceberg: I'm here to promote my album
lmfao why did youtube put a context wikipedia link on this
Socialist humor 🤔 ...
Omg I.can.not 😭😭😭he’s so funny
Hahaha one the best snl clips I’ve ever seen
i think this is in really bad taste considering it's around the anniversary of the sinking. The Titanic sinking was and still is a huge tragedy to many. It should be treated with boundless respect for the people who lost their lives. We mustn't be poking fun at anything remotely related to the sinking.
I can’t get enough. Most adorable iceberg ever.
The makeup looks really nice, too
I mean....technically they hit HIM
Hey white starline!!! Ya built a bad boat!!! It didn't work out. Thats on you honey....
Genius!!! Should be a regular spot on the update!
This guy is really talented.
This is amazing
I think the premise is fantastic. I did not enjoy the characterization. Not even a smile. It is better than the writing for greg guttfeld's new comedy show.
I wish I could watch this for the first time again.
This was a great idea! Personify more things!
"Well someone did"
I'm convinced that no one else in the cast could have done this bit as well or better than Bowen did. Well done!
Absolute garbage.  How can someone so unfunny keep getting jammed down our throats
Instant classic!
this is my third time watching this its so funny
I’ve basically watched this at least once a day since it came out THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bowen Yang is THE FUTURE
TONE DEAF AS USUAL! YOU COULD HAVE WAITED TO DO IT UNTIL AFTER THE MEMORIAL WEEK!
This is HILARIOUS!!!
He perfectly mocked the celebrities who complain that people are angry at them
"I was chilling" — underappreciated detail.
Irish cacophonie.... 😂
Dude I laughed so hard at this one
Will this skit be the final thing to lay the Titanic craze to rest?
Who could dislike this?  Seriously.
Reminds me of David from schitts creek lol
I've watched this like 6 times.  Super weird but awesome. I can't look away.
THE WUHHTERRRRRRRRRR!!!!
This should have been the cold open.
Bowen Yang is gonna be cancelled in 2030 for doing blue face
can we get a full cover on spotify plz?
Bowen is the best!  " Now can we PLEASE talk about my album?!"
Irish cacophony... Like full riverdance 😂😂😂
Loved It!!
They drown bish!!!!
I watched it a few times it was so funny.
LoL ! You built a bad boat 🤣
This was hilarious! 🙃☺️
I watched this 3 times and cracked up every time?
Woe this disturbed me
We must protect Bowen Yang at all costs.  I love him so much
Well, most of the victims froze to death, they didn't drown, but yeah.
An instant classic!
Bowen is EVERYTHING!
#NO MORE COLD # ALL THERMASTATS @can go to 80 degrees AT ALL TIMES
“...you came to where I lived and hit me... old ppl spooning on the bed ready to die... I said their gonna make a movie....
Does anyone else find it weird that Youtube put a context thing for the Titanic on this video?
Omg this was genius comedy 😂😂😂😂😂.
I have watched this over and over again!! and laughed every time 😂😂
This gay Asian is ridiculously cartoonish.Why gays have to act like that all the time?Its an anecdotic  attitude!No fun at all!
This is the tenth time I’ve watched this and I still can’t get enough! This is literally 4m34s of comedy, no skips, swear to god! 😂
I watch this everyday.
This is easily one of my favorite characters. Can we have Iceberg on more often?
Whoever made this costume should get an award
I've rewatched this a million times. Just so great. Also, now I wanna hear the full album.
I love to see Bowen doing what suits him, not some weird Asian character viewed and interpreted by white people.
Bowen, you are truly iconic
Is the ocean abusive if you literally can't live without it
So much to unpack in less than 5 minutes...!
I haven't watched SNL in YEARS, but if this is a sign of its quality these days, I'm back on board.  This guy is fanTAStic!
Bowen Yang can do whatever he wants forever!!!!!!!!!!!!
For real though they built a bad boat. This sketch was everything
I wish I was in the room when they pitched this skit lol like what did they think?!
This is so unfunny.
Who did Michael Che say he was at the end?
Just for the record:  the hat he’s wearing looks like women’s fashionable hats from 1912.  Wonder if that’s deliberate or just coincidental.
the iceberg is clearly innocent x'D
fantastic
wow this is the most gen z humor snl i’ve seen so far tbh
The fact that the guy who played the iceberg turned that crappy skit into comedy gold ! He deserves a medal 🏅.
Since this first aired 10 days ago, I’ve viewed it on _FOUR SEPARATE OCCASIONS!_ Why? Because *BOWEN YANG IS AWESOME!🤩* It’s oft said that "comedy equals tragedy plus time", but the slight "mishap" that occurred 109 years ago - in which, sadly, 20 or 30 people died - it was the Titanic that committed a _NOT exactly_ "hit & run" (more of a "hit & sink"), & the Iceberg was _ENTIRELY_ blameless!🧊#ReleaseTheIcebergAlbumMusic
One of the funniest bits in the history of SNL
first off the song was good and I would listen to it again, second off HE AINT LYIN THO the boat is the one that hit hi
This is such good contemporary social satire. And funny AF!
Hahaha he’s the only Asian American comedian I like. He doesn’t use race baiting or stereotyping his own people and just does what he likes :-)
I absolutely love this episode, simply brilliant!
I expected this to be awful when I saw the thumbnail but he did make me laugh a fair bit. Never knew icebergs could be so camp.
3:50
My Best Feature - I adore Iceberg
I love him sm
"Half my ass was gone. And it was my best feature."
This was just a chance for Bowen to go all "Billy Porter"...   ;-P
He has similar mannerisms like David Rose from Schitt's creek
Possibly the single best skit ever produced by SNL. “Why are you attacking me!? You said you were going to be my Oprah!
He needs to be the new Weekend Update person
So what? He just pushed a guy into a pool or something
Yo what wouldve been cool is if they had water to defend itself too
This was not as funny as I was told it was....not even a little bit.
Love him love this sketch
las culturistas stans RISE
My daughter and I just watched this three times in a row.
Bowen is giving me some serious Miya Ponsetto vibes. I feel like he studied her mannerisms in the Gayle interview for this. 😂😂
I swear I love all his sketches! Always filled with chaotic goodness!
Yang's attitude transitions are on point.
Favorite sketch since the election ended 😂😂😂
That anchor was so aggressive. He really needs to chill.
Can't stop re-watching this.
"You said you would be my Oprah, Colin!"
Best thing since Dooneese.
I have seen this vídeo too many times
1:58 LMAO my favorite moment
*The first time I saw Weekend Update I thought that Che's only part in the show was at the end where it pans over to him and he says goodnight*
The fact that YouTube is now bringing up a “context panel” for the Titanic’s sinking when you watch this video like it’s a conspiracy theory... they must not want the iceberg’s side of the story to get out!!! 🤣
Dear Bowen:  This is the skit that I never knew that I needed. 😂😭😂
This is amazing.
This guy makes my skin crawl, no matter what skit he's in.
Officially my top weekend update guest ever!
Soooo funny
This is just BRILLIANT LAMO
Can this album please be available on Spotify 😂😂😂
This was straight up brilliant.
Bowen needs more recognition. This was a chefs kiss performance.😂😂😂
This is one of my favorite things to come from the wonderful and talented cast of SNL.
People find this funny? Wtf happened to snl
i mean...the iceberg has a point it really WASN’T its fault
I had an early lunch, but I’m hungry for you, lover boy! 🤣😂
This humor shows our desensitization as a culture to tragedy, while we hyper focus on whatever the cause of the day is and live in our echo chambers.  Very sad.
Incredible
All jokes aside, “Lover Boy” is a bop
This. This was hilarious.
Human beings evolved from the oceans. Why do some people deny this fact?
So its a Gayberg then
Good grief, the worst. The only thing that holds to show up now is Kate McKenna and most of news, but this guy is not funny.
Jesus Christ is our lord and savior! Repent for your sins! God loves you unconditionally! John 3:16 repent!!!!!!
WE also have HUMBACKS ALL THE WAY TO THE MALL AND DOLPHINS AND BELUGA WHALES . please be carefull <) xoxo
I really SNL but joking about 1500 people dying is in poor taste.
let IT RIPPP PLEASE NOW I AM TIRED AND HUNGRY . BLUE FISH AND STRIPPER /STRIPER ...please do NOT eat my seal xoxo shes a REPEAT MOMMA ...and her pups get cared for under the Sabin point dock :( (((
biiiigggg asss BLUE FISH
PERFECT HIStory LessON.. PURRR FECT.. Win(FREY CHANNING).. McBath Jennifer CHANCE MiliCent WHITE STARR LINE on U Honey #TheBestIsYetToCome
I have never seen an actor with less range. This man plays the exact same character in every skit he is in. Okay to expand his acting range a bit to be able to play a multitude of characters with options. Example: Joe Peschi could play this guy in half a second, a goofier guy, or a ruthless villain because he has said acting range... This man can, and will only play a feminine whatever...
tell those cows to stop fake laughing.
How many years before people are offended that Bowen Yang did ice face?
Too soon
You slayed ice queen and yes they ran onto you.😄😄😄
This guy's playing the same character every week and relying on his flamboyancy to make people laugh.
LOVED this skit...hope they continue "the Iceberg" :-)
The genius of this is...if i heard this on the radio i would fall apart laughing..
Does anyone here think that someone is going to wear a similar hat at the Kentucky Derby or at Ascot?
You said you’d be my Oprah Colin! Lmao
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gold
Bowen just scored himself a main cast member promotion on next years SNL
great skit! 🤍🚢🧊
“Yeah it’s called MUSIC” Just realized this is a dig at Sia LOLOL
“You said you’d be my Oprah COLLINNN” “I never said that—“ “WELL SOMEONE DIDUHHH”
"I had an early lunch...but I'm hungry for you"
Bowen is the next Kate.
Well, if Madonna can call an album 'Music', why the hell can't an iceberg do the same?
"And I was looking at this and I was like, 'Oh my God they're gonna make a movie out of this.'"  I'm fucking dead.
This is what people are talking about?
Absolutely hilarious 🤣
This gets funnier everytime I watch it.
I’ve watched this multiple times already
Bowen Yang is becoming a legend
I loveeee the Titanic. This was sooo good 10/10
More of Bowen, please!!!!!
Karen = Iceberg. 🤣💙🧜🏾‍♂️😏
Okay, but he has a point..
Snl is lucky they have so many talented character actors because this writing is crunchy
“Half my a$$ was gone “ 😂😂😂😂✋✋✋✋
THE. BEST.
What the iceberg should say is I was minding my own business just floating in the water when all the sudden this fast moving ship ran into me.
THIS is my favourite SNL skit that I've ever seen. The iceberg was  so cold and calculating. LOVED it!
I'm dying, this was hilarious. I named the bunny in my neighborhood Bowen because this guy is the sh** and slays me every time I see him,  as does the neighborhood baby bunny. It is always a delight to see either one!
Repent Repent the day of the Lord is at hand! If you have not received salvation from Jesus Christ you will spend all eternity  (trillions and trillions) of years in hell...There will be everlasting torment for you and everyone you know who doesn’t know the Lord. There will be whaling and gnashing teeth. Where the fire is never quenched and the worm never dies. Repent today cry out for mercy! A man must be born again to enter the Kingdom of Heaven
"It was 1,500 people..." Iceberg: "WHY ARE U ATTACKING MEEEEE?"  Me: This is so entertaining.  EDIT: oml this blew up- 2022
Bowen is the best!💗
This was absolutely hilarious!!
This is amazing!  I laughed 'till I cried! OMG!
"like sorry that 30 or 40 people died, or whatever"
Y’all actually find this funny 😬😬🤮
Fucking Brilliant!
It's really annoying when people who are gay have to do this fake voice. If you're gay then speak like a normal person, when you do that little high pitched squeal, you're just fake.
I said "oh I'm sorry," which is insane.
Just when you thought the iceberg that sank the Titanic couldn’t get anymore iconic...Bowen is a king 😌
Now I’m hoping they do another sketch with Bowen for the anniversary of the Hindenburg disaster...
The Iceberg: You said you would be my Oprah, Colin! Colin: I never said that. The Iceberg: *WELL SOMEONE DID!*
I thought the song was gonna be about titanic too 💀
Wow! Something genuinely funny on SNL. Oh My!
Me, siding with sass iceberg:  It’s not the iceberg’s fault, it’s the people who can’t navigate a ship the size of my CITY 😂
Iceberg is Burning!
I mean, they hit HIM! What about what he endured , lol!!
Is that White Face I see? How disgusting. Oh wait, it’s not black face so it doesn’t matter. Go for it! There is zero hypocrisy to see here.   By the way I don’t really care what face you wear. As long as you treat others with respect I’m good with you.
It’s a no from me dog
I LOVE THIS GUY!!!!!!!
This is so funny
WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING MEEEEEEEE?!?!!??
I love how all these people in the comments are discovering drag culture. Welcome!  It’s wonderful here.
I have watched this about 20 times since yesterday, genuine roars of laughter and I'm a dour Scotsman. I'll be quoting bits of this forever. "It's a hyper pop, EDM, new disco fantasia."
This is hilarious!
This sure as F had me LMAO this morning!
using ad blocker and now we need a "context blocker" this annoying giant banner is yet another example of idiots working at googles these days
My new “best skit ever” skit.
哈哈哈哈哈
i'm literally laughing outload, Bowen Yang is the best this to happen to SNL in like, 20 years. Enough of just the same type of white people. love!!
i love Bown Yang! He's *hilarious*
Wow brilliant
This is the kind of comedy that SNL has sunk to?  #NotFunny
HILARIOUS! One of the best Weekend Update interviews. 😀
This sketch is 274 seconds, no skips, swear to God
For an iceberg he has a hot temper.
Ok gonna need the full version of Loverboy...that sounds like a bop
This has to be the best Weekend Update performance since Stefon
Hey,White star line ,you built a bad boat....... Lmaso🤣😂😅😆
there's "context" about the titanic from encyclopedia britannica under the vid i'm- 😶😶😐😆😆
What was going through your head that fateful night? ...a ship... 😑
He's not wrong and also, based on Lover Boy, I would totally buy that album.
Song had potential!!🤷🏽‍♂️🤣
Now I wanna know the thought process behind this...
I have never laughed so hard at a skit!!!! "You came to where I live and YOU hit ME!!!!" 💀💀💀💀💀💀
More Bowen Yang please.
ICONIC
that iceburg is fucking fabulous
Bowen sounded like Joel Kim Booster when he said "Hey White Starline. You built a bad boat. It didn't work out. That's on you honey!"
I want to see the ocean and the iceberg have a rave figth splashing salty water for the ocean ice cube for the iceberg throwing it at each other and that’s all that’s on the table  and they just argue because of the titanic
I have never seen Bowen do a bad sketch
I want to see the ocean and the iceberg have a rave figth splashing salty water for the ocean ice cube for the iceberg throwing it at each other and that’s all that’s on the table  and they just argue because of the titanic
I can't stop watching this.
This isn't funny
#PINKTUBPROJECTIWASBORNTHISWAYYY ;)))
Homeboy said “half my ass is gone, which was my best feature!!” I’m done lmao!
Yang is SO FUNNY!
😂 Love the headpiece.👌
youtube drama in a nutshell
already classic
I need to be able to like this more.
it was midnight i was CHILLING
Bowen is fantastic!
Watched it four times LMAO! "You hit me!"
Highlarious
I've only watched this about 10x   12 tracks no skips swear to God 😆
bowen yang elevates SNL 🥳
ok, I change my mind about Bowen Yang now. At first, I thought he is just a diversity hire. But, with this skit, wow, you have my respect, sir.
🤣😂🤣😂
Is he the next SNL major star?
😂😂😂😂😂
I don’t know about you; but I’m running 🏃‍♀️🏃🏽‍♂️🏃🏼out to get that platinum single 💽, “LOVERBOY” !!! 🤣
Great Costume!
Fantastic!
slowly but surely getting our hearts
I have watched this more than I care to admit
wait, i’m actually on the icebergs side now like
I know he's popular but for some reason Bowen Yang gets on my nerves and I'm not sure why.
Who wrote that masterpiece? ❤️😄
Iceberg  was told the sinking  would not be mentioned  on this interview.  Not very  ethical  to bring it up.   This is traumatic.
Sigh. I miss the original SNL.
All the exaggerated laughter is hyper-annoying. Are they being prompted?
iceberg clearly represents nowadays generation..very clever
Omg I know oceans such a b@#£&
Bowen is amazing, he should be the protagonist more often.
For future Weekend Upddates, I demand to hear from the Ship and the Ocean.
I really like the song.
“I’m here to promote my album” said the iceberg
"They drowned, BITCH!" I can't 😂 😂 😂
Is it wrong that I want a full version of the loverboy song? Im also a very straight man.
He endlessly portrays the same over the top, hysterical and one-dimensional character, only with a different costume. 🤮 Please bring back Taran Killam and just let this iceberg melt
I would like to hear all 12 tracks on his album "Music"
OMG - he’s awesome!  And right.
"Why are you attacking me?"  (tries to spread blame to water)
😂😂😅
Low key I want a full version of "Lover boy" 🎶
They missed the first joke, when Colin asked what was going through your head that night...answer should have been THE TITANIC!
Please have the water come in and have it be Awkwafina!!!!
"They came to where I live and hit ME!"
“You have an album?”  “YES, it’s a hyper-pop-ediem-new disco-Fantasia, it’s called ✨music✨
Not funny. God I hope this awful show gets canceled and MADTV comes back in it’s stead. MADTV via 20 years ago beats modern day SNL any-day
Bowen Yang is just bringing the gay energy we've been needing for a while
omg all the campy gay pop songs sounds like that
you can see that colin is genuinely cracking up and saying you did good at the end <3
I don't believe this guy is the real iceberg, but some rando berg that Stefon brought home from a nautical themed club.    Stefon:  This club has everything.  Chimps. Possums.  The iceberg that sank the Titanic.
Bowen as the iceberg  Therapist- Colin Jost
Gold! Bowen Yang gets better with every act he does
“Hey what if an iceberg was gay and Asian?...”
I kinda like the song ngl
Too soon.
Too soon. 🥲
I'm obsessed with everything Bowen Yang is in. It's crazy! Everything he does is hilarious for some reason. Not even one flop.
One of their best. Hilarious.
What happened to SNL
Iceberg was spittin' facts tho...
I love Bowens humour so much I'm finding out
This gotta be one of Bowan's best!
More of this guy, he is funny. Bring some life to the rest of the flat cast. Seriously, how long are they going to let Kenon Thompson play literally the same character in every skit? I used to like him but now it's worn out.
Awww, poor Sharon Osbourne ....
"Why are you attacking me?!" Priceless!!!!
Bowen is so under-utilized.
this is terrible......
TOO SOON!
3:53 U betta work bitch 🔥
the more I watch this, the better it gets!!! gold!!!!
his deepest desires are "come to my house," and "let's have some dinner," I died.
it's not the iceberg's fault the captain didn't pay attention and decided to set sail at night.
Best skit I've seen in a long while from SNL.
If Alexis Rose was an iceberg!
Hilarious and smart!! Lol was cracking up haha 😂🤣 !!!
This is sooooooooo stupid and unfunny. I identify as an iceberg and I find this VERY VERY OFFENSIVE! An Asian man with a piece of pillow memory foam on his head is just some horrible stereotype and very prejudicial. I am organizing a March
Hilarious
This is Bowen Yang playing Heidi Gardner.
They keep letting this guy on. SNL trash.
THE LOOK AT 00:47 😂😂
I thought it was meh right up till his gay song.  Wish I could unsee that.
“NOBODIES TALKING ABOUT THE WATERRRRRR 💦, I DONT SEE ANYONE CANCELING THE OCEAN 🌊 “ LMAO 💀
Good on Michael Che for the DMX shout out
"They drowned bitch!"
This ranks up there with Cecily doing Cathy Anne, Girl at a Party, and Pirro. LOVE YOU, BOWEN! Instant CLASSIC!
I laughed so hard at this episode. The iceberg outfit😂😂😂 The whole scene was hilarious.
Johnny Weir has gone overboard!
The silly skits are where snl shines 😆
The ocean will be canceled soon enough lol
oh my god the iceberg is literally canceled
when are they gonna interview the 9/11 plane now? In a few more decades?
“They bumped into me, and I said _‘oh, I’m sorry,’_ which is, INSANE.” I wonder if people realize that's an Asian joke. Since we are the ones who always apologize when someone bumps into us on the street. 🤣
Like 1500 dead
Cool skit! 🧊
Iceberg made music
Who wrote this skit. ?  Would love to know.  Brillant
ok now dress as a plane on 9/11.
Nobody's cancelling the ocean :DDDDDD
A typical response from someone responsible for a huge number of deaths: greatly downplay the number of dead!
I'm glad when they decided to get an asian to be part of the staff, they didn't just go out and get any ol asian. This guy is really really funny.
Only Dad can name an album "Music".  Dad will be displeased
they made a movie about this?
I was expecting this to be terrible, and it had me dying laughing. Which is better than dying drowning.
This iceberg is giving me some serious David Rose energy.
🥱
That album is gonna be cold.  Song gave me chills.  I'm shivering with anticipation!  (I just went full Doctor Freeze with the puns there, and I refuse for that not to be noticed! :) ).
*Micheal Che* "I'm Earl Simmons goodnight!"  respect
"Now can we please talk about my album" just lives on a loop in my head and now people are looking at me weirdly for laughing at 'nothing' 🙃😅
i am getting so sick of the clickbait. This is clearly not the iceberg and a human actor
terrible... sorry
"And I was like... Oh my God! They are gonna make a movie about this" lol facts
Love that outfit.
More Bowen! He should be more than a featured player. He's brilliant.
Sad thing is, icebergs really are being cancelled, thanks to global warming.
"They bumped into me and I said ' Oh I'm sorry', which is insane" Oh honey, we feel you. It happens all the time
They drowned bitch!!!! I can’t!!! I’m sorry but whatever... bad boat it didn’t work out it’s on u honey!!! Yo I can’t... he killed it!
Actually wouldn't mind hearing the rest of that song.
I loooove Bowen! I hope to see him in more sketches and weekend updates
Too soon
“Well someone did!” 😩😂
I wanna be as high as the writer who thought of this was.
love bowen yang
I turned around and half of my ass is gone 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Bowen is my favorite cast member, by far!
Homeboy said it’s the water!!!
I have not laughed this hard in a long time.
That was soooooo COOL!
When he asked what was going through your head, he should’ve said the titanic
Hey look, it's gay Sub-Zero.
To soon
I will never watch Titanic the same.
The iceberg apologized for getting hit because he's Canadian, probably...
This was genius.
Bowen is a great performer, but isn't funny. Kinda like Leslie, but not as loud but just as flamboyant.
Where was Rose?.  Rose you know that door was large enough for two people 😂
Hyper-Pop EDM New Disco Fantasia is trending!
It's insane how bad SNL is now. This is peak "saying words with the cadence of a joke so people laugh but it's not actually funny"
Did anybody notice the whiteface?
BwahahahaHAHAHAhahaha!!! So well done and this was homage to Chris Brown. Poor guy just wanted to talk about his new album and the reporter insisted to talk about him and Rhianna. I felt bad for Chris Brown when that happened
That poor Iceberg 😰
This is literally every episode of drag race 🤣😂
Iconic.
I don't think I've laughed that hard since Melissa McCarthy's impression of Sean Spicer :-) :-) :-)  'IT WAS THE WATER!!"
More Bowen Yang! PLEEZ!! That is an instant classic.
Personification at its finest!! 🔥🎉💖🔥🎉💖
Bowen needs to be a main player now. 🙏🏼
I loved it, it was genius! 😂😂😂😂
He's one of the worst people i have seen on this show. Cant stand him and ridiculously unfunny
Ironic how self-serving righteous loosers of SNL find humor in those lives taken in a tragedy 100 plus years ago, I guess they'll somehow attach humor to the 9-11 tragedy and schedule for another pitiful SNL skit, all the while talking down to to people that actually make a difference in this world. These SNL people are pathetic. And for all those pathetic WOKE people that watch SNL, why silence when it comes to this?  Sure, normally I would laugh at this myself, but when I can point out SNL and the "WOKE" as being the hypocrites they are, I'll jump at the chance.
Me watching it for the 100th time...
This was overdue!!😂🧡
"half my ass is gone, which is my best feature!" Ha!
If this "stole the show" it must have been one hell of a shit show, terrible show. I'm not talking about the actors or portrayals, nothing. The jokes were as well writen as the titanic staying afloat itself.
So much beneath the surface. Yeah like an iceberg
Another in a tradition of horrible pointless sketches on the SNL news segment. Absolute waste of air time.
I would buy the single though
“I didn’t hit them they hit me”💎 best sketch of the night
Impression is spot on!
So funny
I was chilling
“Hey White Shore Line! You built a bad boat. . .LMFAO!
Absolutely perfect
Laughing from second 1.
iceberg almost broke character “yah its called music!” 😂
Bowen is officially my favorite cast member after this sketch
Best 👊
Album called, "Music." 😂
This is the most inspired bit since close encounter
That's actually a good point. The water killed the people not the iceberg
Kids 20 years from now...what's an iceberg?
I loved this!!
This was way too soon. I'm offended.  /commencecancellation
This will be funny in 20 years!  Nobody is talking about THE WATTTTER!!!
only reason the asian guy got on here is cuz a white guy made a racist joke, SNL is a big joke and the worst show.... i almost pity these people
Great job, writer Anna Drezen.  You and Bowen put together a brilliant bit.
Nobody is canceling the ocean 😂
I said “oh I’m sorry” which is INSANE
This was like an Asian-Iceberg hit Dan Levy. Yang did a great job.
His face at 00:46 is the one when you about to say the exaggerated B****😂
This was sheer perfect lunacy, it harkens back to the early days of Killer Bees, Land Shark and Belushi's samurai .
I usually think stuff like this is stupid but i was actually laughing out loud. That's probably because Bowen Yang never broke character. He also sounded like so many of the nit witted 20-something whiners i know. He's hilarious! Aidy B. needs to stop breaking character all the time. It's not funny.
the icebergs song is lit
I specifically look for Bowen skits. More. Bowen.
LOL Bowen Yang getting indignant is always the funniest thing.
I liked the latter half but the beginning reminded me of a very distasteful interview done before... oh idk somewhere in 2013
I never thought I would see a triggered iceberg.
Poor taste that over 2,000 people died is not a joke is 911 burning towers next! F snl for this sh_t skit!!!!!!
🤣🤣🤣
Justice for Iceberg!
"Lover boy" is low key iconic.
Not funny
But nobody is cancelling the ocean 🌊😒     🥺😂😂😂 Epic!!
Bowen!
Omg.. He is TOO FUNNY! 🤣
That was so absurd and so funny.. and props to the costume and makeup design!
Such an obnoxious character, Yang nailed the acting.
This was a hell of a lot funnier than I was expecting.
Literally no comments on these people and their terrible laughs?
Who let the drunk sorority girls in??
Lover boy is good
Not in good taste.
An iceberg  with a  publicist and a major drama tude Omg  🤣🤣🤣
Was Melissa Villasenor demoted from live skits? She's been in one pre-recorded bit in the past few months.
"It was midnight, I was *chilling* " lol, definitely what and iceberg would do.
The Iceberg is an obvious fraud. The real Iceberg would have melted long before now.
So, this iceberg acts just like Meghan Markle?
Wow this just isn’t funny at all. Poor snl they try so hard
Bowen Yang slays yet again. SO funny SO gay and I am here for it all. It's a Yang thang y'all 😅
Is this homage to the Paris Hilton interview on Letterman?
an absolutely genius piece of comedy... did they sneak in a jab at Madonna's 2000 release "Music" lol
Why are you attacking me. You said you would be my Oprah Collin. Lol
It is so random that the iceberg sings a totally unrelated song at the end. Even the audience gets kinda quiet like, “Wait, what? We’re doing this?” but it’s Bowen Tang so we are all HERE FOR IT. This sketch was just SO good.
These people are a pack of idiots.
Yang nailed it. Hilarious. Say what you want about global warming but the upside is that icebergs are no longer a problem on that North Atlantic route. Next WEU should interview Global Warming who will say "Your Welcome"
I need an EP with “Loverboy” and “Lovefight” (feat. Kristen Wiig and Dua Lipa) IMMEDIATELY.
https://youtu.be/-mCgkjVWDzA
Clearly, an instant classic bit! We need more Bowen Yang!
lol
It was midnight. I was chilling.  😂
Fantastic.  Soooo funny.
This is award worthy
Love this!
He looks good for a 109 year old iceberg ☺
This skit is genius 😂😂 though I can’t help but wonder if the iceberg is a representation of something...🤔 genius lol
*Autopsy said they DROWNED. That's not me! THAT'S WATERRR!" LOLOL 🤣
Can’t wait for a hundred years to pass and so the plane that hit the twin towers can talk
Anyone have any idea what Bowen says to Colin.  It’s inaudible but my guess is I just want to be a star.  May be projection but the lip kinda matches.
Worth multiple watches.  Bowen Yang ily
Bowen Yang is giving me Dan Levy vibes
This was pure comedy gold. Still, it brought to mind an African saying. "Until lions start writing down their own stories, the hunters will always be the heroes."  Not many people would think to tell the story of the Titanic from the perspective of the iceberg. It wasn't lost on me that the comedian may not often have seen stories told in a manner that reflected  his perspective. Perhaps that experience informed this sketch.
Any reason why the iceberg has to be effeminate ? Sickening.
The current writers and performers on SNL (With the exception of Keenan) run the gamut of talent from A to B..... This is the kind of comedy sketch you would see in the basement of a pizza parlor performed by the local town comedy troupe....
Got Damn it SNL,,, I caught myself singing lover boy in my head at work today!!!! 2 flippin days later!🤬 Came back for an encore.
Grumpy cat once said "I love "Titanic." My favorite character was the iceberg." I think she would be proud here.
Why is no one talking about Loverboy It won't stop repeating in my brain
This is the funniest thing I've seen on the internet, today.
He deserves an Emmy from this performance.
That song was a bop though. LOL
Pictured: COMMITMENT. Bowen doesn’t do aaaaaanything halfway. “So we were thinking you could play the iceberg that sank the Tita—“ “I’M IN.”
This is the sassiest iceberg I've ever seen and I love it 🥰🥰
"playing the violin and yelling...." 🤣🤣🤣
I love Bowen Yang's songs! I was actually humming it in the shower today!
Day before the show was the Robert E. Lee Surrender Day (4-9-1865) and Lorne Michaels puts this whiney crap on tv?  Southerners needed some ridicule of neo-Confederates and their Jim Crow statues!
Kate McKinnon and bowen yang need a show together
Whats icebergs day job???🤣
You have an album?
Acting-wise, this is one of the best SNL pieces in years. Bowen Yang is beyond brilliant here.
Bowen is amazeballs
So this is a Stefon ripoff then?
Oh my god that was the best thing I’ve seen on SNL in years. Can we keep him forever? Hey Lorne Michaels keep this dude and ditch the Scientologist. Her Britney is stupid.
To be fair, most people froze so it’s kind of the air’s fault for making the water cold
I guess all you need is a 100 years or so and then you can make jokes based on a tragedy ... 🤷🏻‍♂️
They need to repeat this next year with Grammy results! 😂😂😂
Hilarious and great costume!!
WHERE CAN I GET THE MUSIC ALBUM IS IT ON SPOTIFY
Um, this needs to be a recurring character.
It's crazy how just about ever line in this sketch is quotable.  Time to add this to my "watch everyday" playlist.
Too many punchlines  ( and I never saw the movie).
what a horrible show the lat 20 years there have only been a few good shows what a shit show this gay dude ain't funny
This is so weird and brilliant. I am loving the amazing content that a gay, Asian player is adding to the show.
*this — this was.. BRILLIANT!* 👏🏽
This man is SO TALENTED he needs more roles
the iceberg hat almost rivals rose's!
blue face, not cool bro.
SNL: Next you should interview White Star Line. They may have gone out of business decades ago but WE CAN'T BLAME THE OCEAN. A PERSON WHOSE NAME WAS KAREN TOLD ME SO!!!!
#waterisoverparty
He’s a cross between Wendy Williams and Neville Paperman from iCarly
Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant!
Bring back the iceberg!
Wasnt the iceberg part of Trump's cabinet?
Gold. Pure Gold.
BOWEN YANG .... Is SO funny ..This episode is a Classic . His timing is just Brilliant . GREAT JOB !!!!
You know what people aren't talking about;  THE WATERRRRR!!!!
I wonder how that iceberg stays on Bowen's head so well? There's no strap and I can't tell how it's secured to his head, but he moves all over the place and it doesn't even wobble. Kudos to the prop department!
im laughing so hard im crying omg i didn't know i needed a qween to be the iceberg
SNL is beat!!!
#theoceanisoverparty
U said u would be my Oprah, Colin!  I never said that.  Well, someone did!
“You said you’d be my Oprah, Colin” 😂😂😂
How inappropriate and insensitive. People died and you're making fun of it.
Pretty distasteful..
BAH i love this so much😂💀 they really called out sia😂
What was going through his head on that fateful night?  You mean other than a large cruise ship?
I was unaware the iceberg was gay.  Can't we please talk about the trans icebergs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hihihi
Actually, few, if any, people died from drowning that night.   The majority of people died from freezing to death in the water, because its temperature was below freezing @ 28 degrees Farenheit. Think of the movie, and how Jack could barely talk and breathe before he died. (He explained how it felt to be in freezing water temperatures, when he saved Rose from jumping, at the beginning of the movie.) Also, remember the people dead in the water, when the one boat came back to look for survivors.
The iceberg that sunk the Titanic... They cant just admit they're out of ideas
A brilliant sketch.  Can’t stop watching it.
If they did a character for other events with a new perspective - loved this SO much.
I'm sorry, but how is that the skit that is offending the internet?  While admittedly I'm not a huge Bowen Yang fan, I found that neither particularly funny nor, even a little, offensive.  I mean how do these people even make it through an episode of SNL if this sketch is too much for them?
Out of taste. People died in that event.
This shit is funny!  The Iceberg should have said, "Y'ALL KILLING ME WITH THIS...THIS IS MY LIFE!"
He deserves an Emmy for this
Pay attention SNL this is the best skit in like forever.
He was fantastic 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 he's one of the most talented snl ever discovered
Not a suspicious story at all.
Terrific!  Best, 'it's all about me skit yet". Great job Bowen Yang!
This is funny.  Beautifully funny.
THE WATER bitch not an iceberg🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
BOWEN IS THE BESSSSSST!!
Lol gold.
More ICEBERG PLEASE!
They need to make the Titanic installment for The Ring, starring Bowen Yang as Iceberg.
Love Bowen and SNL but this is not it.
This is James Charles in a nutshell
Actually White Star built a very good ship. The fact that it took two hours and forty minutes to sink, all but two lifeboats were launched properly. Let’s just say that any other ship outside Titanic and Olympic (Titanic’s near identical sister ship), any other ship would have taken more damage and gone down faster
Brilliant!!!!!  Finally, the truth is told. They hit him. (And took off one of his best features)
I'm sorry but less than 2 seasons in and I'm starting to think Bowen Yang is already too good for SNL 😂 Can't wait to see what he does in the future!
I think Keenan would have been great as the ice berg
OMG funniest ever😂🤣😂
"They Drowned bitch"
"Why, You attacking me :( Nobody's Talking about the WATER"!
"Like, sorry That 20 or 30 people died, or whatever..."
That's a pretty good Dan Levy impression
This was a great skit and he did a great job Bowen Yang!!!!   I was laughing and so impressed by how they reacted about the sinking and his album, Music!!!!!
Funniest SNL bit in months, maybe years.
Holy, and I was remembering a friend's bday is on April 14...like the sinking
More Bowen Yang! 😂
So good. Bowen Yang is fantastic.
Yang is setting a new bar....
Anyone else come for the tire-fire in the comments and then realize that no one is saying anything even remotely critical about this flop of a skit? People calling this a "must watch! lol!" skit must have literally never seen anything well written and legitimately humorous. I promise it's out there y'all, and this surely isn't it.
Soooo very funny !!!!!!!!!!!!  Loved it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5 thumbs down
That was so good!
He rhymed house with house. The iceberg lost all credibility with me because of that.
Best skit ever!!!
Too soon??
😂
It’s called “Music”! Love the nod/dig at Madonna’s “Music” album 😂🙃🤣
One of the best sketches
This is SNL gold medal level of funny.
“THEY DROWNED, BITCH” OFJAKSKSJJAKS OMG IM WHEEZING
WARNING ⚠️ Do not eat, and watch this. You could choke to death! ⚠️
This was HILARIOUS!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂  I am not usually a fan of a gentleman acting feminine, but that was so funny!!! Whoever wrote that is a genius. Laugh my socks off. Poor iceberg! Butt was the best feature... Haha!
I don't understand why people who died are a joke now.
#theoceanisoverparty
Bowen Yang is my favorite "newcomer" on snl! he is so funny!!!
Yang's comic timing is perfection.
I can't stop watching
“You have an album??” “Yes! It’s a hyper pop EDM new disco Fantasia.” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
SNL why is Bowen not a main cast member yet????
Another distasteful skit by SNL  go figure
Honestly this is brilliant, this is comedy gold!
How do they keep a straight face, EVER.  OMG..
Bowen funniest person on SNL now period.  He icebergs every sketch.  Chris Redd is hilarious as well.  They're the best
Going through the iceburg head that night. A ship
,,,,,,,,,, With out the Laugh Track you wouldn't know when this "SHOULD" be funny,,,  SAD
I mean, the Iceberg WAS just there minding its own business. It's not like it rant into the ship ....
That was way funnier than it had any right being!
"It's twelve tracks no skips, swear to god" 😂
This was great.
They bumped into me and i said I’m sorry which is insane 😂
"Irish cacophony" I DIED! <3 We're so loud.
!!!
OH NO 😂😂.. next thing, Iceberg will be on Housewives of Antarctic!
Goddamn, he worked a LOT of material into that iceberg. He's so creative, I'm in love!
Wow what an ice queen
I have watched this video at least 15 times, if not more, and I'm still laughing out loud.  Bowen Yang is a national treasure that most be protected at all costs.
When Bowen Yang said, " Why are you attacking me? You said you would be my Oprah, Colin," I was convinced he does the voice of Lola from Big Mouth.
« That’s not my nammmme »  « ... it’s ur name »
I wonder why there hasn't been a movie about this Iceberg yet
Omg!!! Give this guy a raise already!! Instant Classic!!
damn, who came up with this, hiiiilaaaarious
This was a better bit than I thought it was going to be
Wow
Too Soon
Bowen Yang is hilarious! 😂😂😂
“I SAID I WAS SORRY, WHICH IS INSANE”😂😂😂SO WRONG
“HALF MY ASS IS GONE”😂😂😂
You know what you do with icebergs  right? Ya stick some dynamite 🧨 in it and blow it up.
“Irish cacophony” my name band name
Prime example why Bowen should be a main cast member and not part of the featuring cast.
Stop Victim blaming the Iceberg!  Let him sell his album.
This guy is brilliant
I almost peed my pants watching this!
Gotta side with the iceberg on this one.
I’ve always found SNL to excel in ‘cringe’ comedy. Not on purpose though, like ‘the office’ or something. It’s cringe factor comes from narcissistic pricks who think they’re funny, and seem more concerned with indulging their own egos than being actually entertaining. SNL is shite, always has been.
This is going to be iconic. the ramp-up after "let's do this" is just amazing.
can’t believe how little comments i see about the song, it was my favorite part!!  freakin masterful!  where the person who writes out all the lyrics?!
all facts and no cap
Where can I buy the album?
Not funny. Gay.
Ahahahaha what is happening?! This was so weird and funny...
https://youtube.com/channel/UCCRamAKTNBQKPO35hxuQUtg
I thought it would be bad but it was awesome.
WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING MEEEEEE ?!?!???
The iceberg is a Karen 😂😂😂
The level of conviction. Well done. Very well done, Bowen.
Technically u are water
Where can be buy the t-shirt that says "Nobody is cancelling the ocean"
Actually laughed out loud hahaha
This is dumb
I mean you don't blame the tree, you blame the driver.  Wait what?  😄
One of the best pieces SNL's done. LOVE Bowen Yang so much!
Bowen yang did a GREAT delivery. So awesome!!!
This is the most severe case of Asian White washing I've ever seen!
It’s COLD MUSIC
That’s some funny skit.
I’m watching this for the tenth time and I’m not ashamed to say it......love it !!!
So gay.
Felt like there was a missed opportunity: “What went through your head that fateful night?” “The Titanic”
Fox is about to do a show about how the Pentagon is about to release information on aliens. Should do a skit with Marjorie Greene, Matt Gaetz, and Ted Cruz announcing the alien news 😂😂😂😅
The song is legit!! 🎵
Bowen Yang is brilliant. You can tell he is taking over Weekend Update.
“COME ON OVER AND KISS ME BOY HOLD MY HAND IN YOUR BRAND NEW HOUSE I KNOW YOU DON’T EVER WANNA MISS ME BOY SO LET’S WATCH A MOVIE SPEND A NIGHT IN YOUR HOUSE TOUCH ME WHILE THE ROOM IS SPINNING KISS ME LET’S GO EAT SOME DINNER WINE ME DINE ME I HAD AN EARLY LUNCH BUT I’M HUNGRY FOR YOU LOVER BOY” — *Lover Boy by M.C. Eissberg*
This guy needs to be on more segments. Hello he  is actually funny. Use all of your comedians.
this is skit is the best thing since john mulaney was a writer
His performance is on point. Can we talk about the costuming though? lol
Bobby Trendy vibes. Iykyk
"Why are you attacking me?"
He’s so amazing.
this is too good hahahahha
This is so boring and horribly unfunny.
CANCEL THE OCEAN!!!! YAAAASSSS
I WAS IN LOVE OF HIM!!! I AM DEEEEEPLY I  LOVE OF HIM!!!! THANK YOU SNL!!!!💜💜💜💜🌟🌟🌟👏👏👏👏👏⭐🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🏳️‍🌈
It's too bad Criminal Minds is done, because he sounds like a male Penelope Garcia!!!
Hilarious!  That was awesome..lol
Brilliant!!  May be the best (certainly the most creative) 4:34 of comedy I've ever seen.
My favorite part of SNL that night! So funny!
boo!
That iceberg hat is mesmerizing.
??permanent cast member????? This guy is NOTTTTT funny in the least. Every sketch he does is the same. All he does is act feminine. I dont see any comedy. He belongs gone with Leslie Jones who is equally NOT funny!!
"First of all you came to my house and hit me!" 😅🤣
"I'M HERE TO PROMOTE MY ALBUM!"😅🤣😂
"Comedy"
Instant. Classic.
I love this so much 😂😂
Bowennnn Iceberg
"You said you'd be my Oprah, Collin!" " I never said that" "Well someone did!!"
I die lol funny 😆
Oh my gosh this was SO FUNNY
I love Bowen Yang, I hope they use him more!
I can't say 1 good thing about this skit. Sometimes you wonder why they air even air and play some skits. This is garbage SNL.
This was funny!
Bowen Yang does one character in different costumes.
My mans has just thrown his more liquid cousin under the bus! Whether solid or liquid, h2o has to bond together to expose the real villain here: oxygen! Just because oxygen can’t be bothered to get in and go for a swim, 1500 people gotta die?
This is a career changing skit. Brilliant writing and performance.
asian doing whiteface lol
can someone explain why this is funny?
Everyone wants to be the victim
This is fucking hilarious
Bowen Yang gets better every time I see him. ( Helpful Household Tip- - - you can make your own iceberg hat with merengue).
Sucky skit. All I see is a guy with Styrofoam on his head making stupid jokes about a massive human tragedy.
WE APPRECIATED YOU ICEBERG!! #JUSTICEFORBERG
Pretty sure they're playing a laugh track.
Okay, but he has a point
Hilarious
He just wanted to talk about Rampage.
Yang is the next budding star of the cast. He just jumps off the screen.
I love this one -- super well done! :-)
THE ICEBERG IS TREATED SO UNFAIRLY
I absolutely LOVE this!!!
A most FLAM-BOYANT iceberg indeed
Bowen Yang has been my favorite castmate-add in the last few years.  From the writer's room to the stage, he just goes out there, does his best, and makes sure everyone is having fun. We can feel it. I won't honestly watch the show anymore, but I seek out his sketches.
Hahaha!!!
Nothing about this skit  or the people who died is funny. Tasteless
Love me some TRADE DADDY
He did a great job
Is it ok to make fun of tragedy that killed 1500 ppl? I guess ok when more than 100 years ago
Iceberg should get it's own show or run for office 😆
This is easily one of the funniest "guest spots" they've done on W/U in a while
This is one of the best SNL sketches of all time. Good job!!!!!
"..And the old people are spooning on the bed and ready to die" - brilliant, this whole piece. This line cracked me up. LMAO
You're supposed to be my Oprah Colin 😂😂😂
This is so great hahah
"What did the autopsy say?  You drowned, bitch!"
I would have never thought this bit would work. But it really worked. Wow.
Oh good! They finally wrote Bowen a vaguely amusing bit.
Oh Bowen... this was pure genius! 💕 Thank you!!!!!! 👏👏👏
THIS skit is classic SNL! This goes up there w/Land Shark!! I literally lost my breath 🤣🤣 I laughed so hard!!!
That iceberg could not be MORE gay. lol
Hints of Monty Python eccentricity and absurdity.
Wait!  Wasn't 50 or 40 people?  Now it's 20-30 people?!  Soon it would be just 10 people who died.  lol lol
2nd favorite skit this year...after watching a murder show
This is their best skit since Meet your 2nd wife skit.
This is unfunny trash is why they are getting punched in the inner city
Well done.
WhY aRe YoU aTaCkInG mE
They should have put a little scuffle red paint on the top of that on that Iceberg on his head and then he could have gone look on permanently scarred by this
They did build a bad boat though.
This new cast growing on me, they got some really funny sketches
2:29  As a person with Canadian friends this made me laugh so hard.  How many times have Canadians had someone bump into them and they say oh I'm sorry?
"12 tracks, no skips, no swear to god"  WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THIS I DIED
Bowen is a national treasure ♥️♥️♥️
I want Iceberg on the next season of RuPaul’s Drag Race.
The way that Bowen said “Yeah it’s called music” lives rent free in my head. It’s like a laugh and also like an incredulous scoff in one.
Ok for me the little flute was the best skit and this one comes in second
Ok, Very good sketch.  But shouldn’t someone be offended that he is wearing white and blue skin makeup? Someone out in internet land must kinda look like that.   I’m joking.(for the slow people)
why is this giving me stefon vibes?
Ok, but that song though! Is this on Spotify?
Did not see this coming very well did 😆😁😄🤣😂🙏
Never would have thought a glacier gay
Before I could turn around half of  my ass was gone 🤣
What?... Half my ass was gone!
I loved this sketch. I was 😂😂
The ice berg was just existing. It's people that were not in their natural environment lol
The iceberg is a snowflake.  The iceberg should've said, "it's over 100 years.  LET IT GO!"
the laughs sound so fake
Next week Colin interviews the planes that flew into the World Trade Centers.  "Those things got in MY way, and they were ugly."
I thought its music was going to be the sounds icebergs make when they move lol
cultural appropriation. if it’s not your face don’t wear it. 😂😂😂
If he had of mentioned how they didn’t let black folks on the ship I would have pissed myself
Sounds like the iceberg has PTSD...
Asian comedians are soooo underrated!!!. Love them!!!  Noone is canceling the "OCEAN"!!!?.
Excellent.
This is stupid
Talk about obvious subtext.
Not a lot of people caught the play on the name of the album - "It's Cold Music"
the drowning part is too far amongst other reasons glad you guys laughing that's what I prefer either way!
So true
“HALF MY ASS IS GONE “😂 which was my best asset
All of the influencers who fake "apologize" like this should feel very attack.
And with "Im Earl Simmons, goodnight" Michael Che graduated from in the running to my favorite weekend update anchor of all time
fucking hilarious
This is so not funny
This is literally just the O&A Paris Hilton interview.
Brilliant!!!
I really enjoyed this. Original and funny. Lately, I haven’t been watching SNL, but this is good. I wanna see smart, dumb, roasting comedy. Just go after everyone and have fun.
"White star Line, you build a bad boat". It's true! Iron was low quality, shattered with first hit with Iceberg!
This skit is gold.
The song is stuck in my head
This is worse SNL making fun of the tragedy,this is disrespectful to the deaths,this is the most disrespectful video I have ever seen
Riceberg
This is amazing 3 seconds in 😂
Bowen is such a breakout star for SNL, he is the male answer to Kate tbh.
I can't stop laughing watching this.Lover boy!!!!! Iceberg thinks he is the victim and ocean should be cancelled,wich i agree.he is indeed the victim of a terrible acident: rise of bad music.😂🤣😅🤣😂😅
This is one of the worst and least funny (not funny) of all the SNL skits I've ever seen, and that's hundreds and hundreds, over the lifetime of the show. Obviously, those laughing their butts off in the audience, must be paid or prompted to do so.
I would totally buy that album!
Its funny cause it's true L0L
I often get the feeling that Colin is unaware of what his counter part is going to say until they say it. He often seems amused or surprised.
Dude this is hilarious!! This dude just took "gay" to the next level. Love that shit!!
This is what Paul McCartney said in 1980 on SNL. Father Guido Sarducci was on location in London, on the street outside of Paul's place singing Beatles tunes with a megaphone, early in the morning trying to wake Paul up. When Paul came out in a robe, he asked Sarducci what he was doing. Paul was in on the skit. When Sarducci asked Paul about his recent drug bust in Japan,  Paul stopped the skit and said "Look. we were not going to talk about this."  Just like the iceberg man.
Bowen absolutely blew this out of the water!!! What an amazing performance. This is his breakout sketch. So happy for him!!
i didn't think this would work at all, but weirdly funny...i'm surprised the audience was there for it...a lot of times they (the audience) are pretty lame when it comes to the off the wall sketches.  cool that they gave the reaction it deserved.
"And the Emmy goes to Bowen Yang."
Omg I totally agree with Iceberg ...it was the damn waterrrrrr 😫
Team Iceberg all the way! Plus there was enough room on that freak door for two people lol
best skit in a while!!! :D please do more like this!!
Next time on SNL: Water confesses drowning of the 1500 titanic passengers
Didn't expect this to be that funny!
Extremely funny.   Well played
"half my ass is gone" lmao
Freaking hilarious and well done.   One of those sketches, out of the blue, so to speak...
Perfection
I have seen this video 5 times today!
Make Bowen a main cast member. *Now.*
Bowen Yang is the most talented new cast member of recent years for sure.
This was actually pretty funny.
Well, the Iceberg made some great points. Titanic did bump into him/her/them.
What is so absurd about talking to an iceberg?! Everything!  This is so hysterical!  Thanks, SNL!

Stay fit. Die  anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This  is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have  you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever  looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already  with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to  these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying,  thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten  Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or  guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not  God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son  to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that,  while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the  dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who  confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do  that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a  wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God  will never let you down. Visit NeedGod.com.
they drOWNED BISCH
Wonderfully inventive! Great bit. Hope Bowen does lots more WU bits. "Weekend Update" has helped him establish his style or "find his voice," as is often said in the arts. Shawn R., Mo-Mutt Music #Music4URSpirit
Bowen Yang is my favorite cast member 😍
That song tho
Revelation 19:21, “The rest were killed with the sword coming out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh."
CAN WE TALK ABOUT RAMPART PLEASE
Bowen did such a great job! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽😂
Also so what no one is going to say anything He paints his face all white and this is fine But if he smudged a ton of black paint over his face then his career would be over  Even if he was pretending to be Coal or Fudge or Brownies or whatever, it wouldn’t matter
Beyond brilliant. Instant classic. Bravo.
So you like to mock victims of the Titanic. You should mock the victims of Nanking. It’s not like they are real humans so it should be easy to laugh at them. Come on. You love to mock Holocaust survivors and Titanic survivors we should mock Nanking Turn against your Chinese government masters
This is a classic
1:20 I love how he cracked a little bit when he said, "Yeah, it's called Music." As if he were thinking, "It just gets more absurd from here on out."
too soon
When I saw this I legit thought it was the lead singer from “Empire of the Sun.”
Hilarious
That is going to be a great Halloween costume . I would name it “DIVA TITANIC ICEBERG “costume 👏🏻
Love live Bowen!
Iceberg’s costume looks like cross between Elton John and Prince ... headress is cool too
Hilarious!
Very Real Housewives Reunion energy.
Icebergs playlist
How high were they when they wrote this
Titanic is a LIE .. its another psyop to kill off those oposed to the fedres taking over usa money system .. #TRUTHbeREVEALED #exposeINFILTRATORS  SNL SUCKS just puppets pushing propaganda
This IS classic SNL LOL😅😁🤣😆😁😅
I actually wanna hear the whole song though
This is the first time I’ve laughed out loud at Bowen. Love it!
😂😂😂, Bowen Yang, PLEASE never leave SNL
....This character is perfect! I am dying...
"They drowned, bitch" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
WHAT A BIT! I'M CRYING.
Bowen Yang is one of the funniest cast members of this season, in y opinion.He always cracks me up. Xoxo
Not humorous
This looks like inspired by Paris Hiltons interview with Letterman just after her jail time.
Boo boo bea didsahhhhhhhhh.
"Nobody's CANCELING the OCEAN"  bahahahahaha
"That's on you, HONEY!"
They could only schedule the interview now cuz the iceberg couldn’t fit into the studio before... (thanks global warming :D)
"Lover boy" wasn't that bad. Brought back some 80s vibe
well that segment was about 4 minutes too long
This was one of the most clever AND entertaining skits on the news segment in a while!! Loved it!!
Dude, I feel for Iceberg ://
Global warming was the revenge from the Starline people. Proof is in the ocean.
The Iceberg did nothing wrong
im EARL SIMMONS GNIGHT (DMX)
Bowen Yang is quickly becoming my favorite cast member.
Iceberg lives matter❄️
Brilliant!
This is exactly news today. I hate it.
Hilarious bit:)
Have to love all the "wow what a great skit" comments.  Shills/bots trying to prop up the dying ratings? Ive seen tv commercials more amusing than this. Put a fork in it
Seems like the skit is very well received, except by those who seem to have an issue with the iceberg being gay and/or Asian.
That white jacket is everything.
FIRST OF ALL YOU COME TO WHERE I LIVE AND YOU HIT ME!!!
Is this album available on Apple Music?!?!?
OMG what a great parody on our times!
Liberal heartless bull!
What was going through your head? “A ship???”
Asians being attacked for covid around the world, now they blame the titanic on them 😂
The LOOK Bowen throws at Colin at :47 when he asks “What would you say to the families of those who perished?”  I straight fell out 😂😂😂
-You hit me -you hit my a** -like 20 or 30 people died -
cringe, who wrote this kindergarden skit? yang is worse than leslie
Was anyone else hoping the song would include Titanic puns?
Pretty sure there is a 311 album called “Music”
https://youtu.be/v8oymJoQ6ZE
Too soon?
the tart of the ocean
"look at the autopsy! they drowned bitch!" HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! I lost it!
the genus of it all!!
Earl Simmons 💙🖤✨ ....He'll find his way home....  The shout out will not be missed.
Paris interview lol
racist white face
Bowen Yang and whoever wrote this sketch was GENIUS. This is why I watch SNL 45 years after it's debut.
Please give us more Bowennn he kills everytimee 👏🏽😂
this guy is the new lesli jones, they both suck
"the Irish cacophony behind me" is literally how my dad refers to my mom
Good idea.  Sadly, terribly unfunny. This dude never makes me laugh.
This is the content.
HYSTERICAL!! He completely stole the show with this.
The iceberg has a point he didn’t kill them the ocean did
This whole night there was a lady in the audience with the most annoying laugh. Ruined the show for me
I love him!
Only Bowen can sell something that’s not particularly relevant anymore as completely hilarious and effortless
An Asian man in whiteface?!?! I'm outrage....oh wait. I just remembered I'm not a miserable, whiny liberal.
that is just so gay
Whoever made that iceberg headpiece and outfit. Yes. Thank you.
Is this the token Asian ? as he is not funny.
What album? Is that vanilla ice without the vanilla?
Hillarious! Next week's SNL skit will be "How I Won The Masters"; I can here him say "Take THAT all of you anti-Asian sand bunkers!"
😂😂 nobody’s cancelling the ocean 🌊
RACISTS!
I really hope this dude is gay. He’s always playing this kinda role.
I think it's just the same dialogue skit ,over and over.. I do like SNL.Up there with my favourite shows, but it's missing that star quality like Steve Martin, Jim Carey, Will Ferrell, Kirsten Wigg,Eddy Murphy ect.. I didnt find too much funny this week.. Seemed a bit deflated or somber..  Sorry..
"WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING MEEEE?!"  We need more Bowen Yang please, lol.
Bowen really killed this lmao 😂
I am a huge Titanic fan in the sense of seeing the ship and its artifacts. The fact that SNL decided to make fun of it is not funny.
"I'm here to promote my album. * * *  It's a hyper-pop EDM new disco fantasia"   "Why are you attacking me?!" One of the best in a while!
Please stop using valuable WU time for these pathetically-lame skits!
One of the funniest skits they’ve done in a long while!!
bowen doesn’t miss
Bowen Yang. 😂😂😂
unbelievably weak and stupid. the farthest thing from funny.
He just wanted to talk about his new album: MUSIC. 😭
LMAO! You came to where I live. No one's blaming the water.
Is it me or does the iceberg look like Yoko Ono?
Brilliant!
😘
Let's hope he's not canceled for playing iceface.
This is one of the best skits I've seen in a while. Great song at the end too. Sadly today marks the anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic. RIP to all 1,500 who lost their lives
Bowen needs to have more skits i swear he’s the funniest 💜🤣
This was such a great sketch!! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 I laughed through the entire thing! 😂😂😂😂
Bowen is the funniest iceberg ever!!!! You chill bro!!!
This was the BEST thing out of the weekend!  So hilarious!
Why does he look like anime Mr Freeze?
https://youtu.be/coOtZ1un5ho
Too soon man. Too soon.
Make this guy a regular cast member.  He's sooo good!
THIS will be my halloween costume.
Brilliant! Love love love. He needs more screen time he is the next Kate McKinnon. Every thing he is in is so funny.
#Gematria
Lmao
Clever skit.  I know he's popular, but I don't normally like Yang.  He did a great job here.
I feel like Cecily really helped writing this skit 😂
I love Bowen Yang.
Poor iceberg, half his ass is gone , the world hate him and he will allways be the iceberg how kill several hundreds peoples. 🤣🤣🤣
“Then I hear this Irish cacophony” 🤣🤣🤣
One of the funniest skits in a long time!!!
what going thru your head...........................................................................       80,000 TON OF BRITTLE STEEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It's like if David Rose was an iceberg.
This has major Stefan vibes.
Team Iceberg!
Finally, the true story we've been waiting for.
This skit is so absolutely ridiculous and I'm here for it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Disgusting
first
Also the titanic really was the Britannica repainted for those who were unaware
The iceberg is definitely a leftist
🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭
This crap is why I've not watched in years.
“Half my ass is gone... which WAS my best feature..” Love Bowen in this so much 😂😂😂🥰🥰🥰
Real Housewives Of The Atlantic
Iceburg was right, the Titanic took half of the Iceburg ass. So Titanic fault.😀☺
whoever wrote this is a genius!!
Bowen gives me life every time he is on screen
Too soon man ... Too soon.
"The old people spooning ready to die"   I remember that part of the movie LMAO
Millennial icebergs be like.....
I feel like it doesn't matter what character Bowen Yang is playing, he's always doing the same impression.
Definitely one of the funniest ones for sure...
Not funny. Now that a democrat is president, where is the skits making fun of him? There is none
I can't with this guy. He has no range and plays every character the same way. Read into that as you will.
Iceberg makes a good point
Bowen Yang is a comedic genius.  In a time when people of color desperately need representation, A Star Is Born!!  Thank you, Loren for giving us a true talent & not some unfunny token!
Here's a secret- old people are always spooning on the bed waiting to die. That's what we do right before the earlybird special and Wheel of Fortune.
Its cold miser!
This is a snl classic like the days of classic SNL skits 😁😁😁😁😁
This is literally every singer/rapper who does something sh*tty and then tries to put it behind them.
Absolutely brilliant! Funniest thing I've seen in a long time.
I’m not here to talk about THE SINKING. 😂🤣🤣
HILARIOUS!!! Best skit of the night
omg we must stan, stream loverboy by iceberg
One of the most hilarious SNL skits I’ve ever seen. I’ve watched it 10 times in a row.  🤣🤣🤣
This skit was just further proof that SNL has never waivered in its quest to make us laugh.  They will take ANY situation and show us another dimension that either makes us laugh... or THINK really hard about a topic... that we'd never really entertain without SNL's creative minds. I don't know how longer Lorne Michaels can keep finding and recruiting great talent, but you have to admit; SNL has been on a serious roll since October 11, 1975; when Saturday Night Live (SNL) let loose a show featuring Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, Gilda Radner, Garrett Morris, Jane Curtin and Laraine Newman.  Congrat's to Lorne Michaels and all the people who make SNL a favorite place for me to chill and laugh. This pandemic has taken its toll on me and my family/friends... however; SNL is shameless in its pursuit of happiness.  Namaste... SNL.
love it!!!
this was funny
only 1500 people died? covid-19 was doing that in the US daily
I would like to hear the album.
Yawn. Soo funny. Ha ha. Zzzzzzz.
"What was going through your head?"  A boat. Obviously.
Step aside Stephon
Hilarious. Great writing.
In just gonna cone out and say it. Chris Redd is not funny.
"I was chilling"
Bowen Yang is a goddamn national treasure.
hilarious!
The iceberg is a total Karen
It was midnight, I was chilling...an iceberg
This guy is one dimensional. He can only play the gay drama queen in every sketch.
I love Bowen Yang in anything he does. Titanic jokes. Too soon?
lazy as hell.  Cheap.  Maybe next week they can tell a FDR joke.  I wonder if they can do it without the Stereotype bullshit.
The iceberg looks good for being 100 years old
not funny
The iceberg makes good points
This show has been hit or miss lately, but when it hits it HITS! Irish cacophony!
Still promoting this titanic hoax. Read this by Miles Mathis, titled "The Titanic: the Fraud that Keeps on Giving"
This guy is awesome .😃😄
Colin: "Tell us, what was going through your head that fateful night?" Me, watching from home: THE TITANIC!
I'm team iceberg.
Ok, I have got to be missing something because I really don't understand what's so funny about this skit.  This is about the least funny SNL skit I've ever seen and I remember the dark years between Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers.
Amazing.
😳😳😳😳
One of the funniest bits I've seen in ages. Smart, clever, original, and this guy  has impeccable comic timing.  Bravo!
Iceface!
The pauses that he made to let the audience laughs in are amazing.
I'm sorry...what was funny? Kinda lame. You can tell SNL is still paying people to laugh.
Good shit
Iceberg has a point he was the victim
"This Irish cacophony"....😅
they got alot better when they gave up the political bs. still waitin for them to actuialyy go after joe like they did trump. but joe is "comedy proof"
Granted, Iceberge isn’t wrong about the ship coming to him. Considering most people really are split on who to blame, though, (The captain who sailed into icy waters despite warnings, the ship’s designer who left fatal flaws in the ship, or the visionary responsible for the ship’s creation who also pressured the captain into sailing into those icy waters) I’m surprised that isn’t bright up.
Uh, guys, is the iceberg that the Titanic hit a republican ?
We got that iceberg, we sent global warming after him....
I have always maintained that the iceberg's ass was its best feature, but nobody agreed with me.
Funniest Weekend Update bit in a while. A LONG while.
Wasn’t no iceberg some very important people were aboard that vessel who opposed the federal reserve
This was brilliant.
So...gay Asian iceberg?
Bowen Yang is flat-out hilarious in this. Colin is the perfect straight man (no pun intended) for Bowen's tirade.
Yep, that was funny.   Now do I have to wait another 20 years for something funny on SNL?
I love that there was a "beneath the surface" joke hidden in the front end of this segment
In all fairness, one can't blame a stationary mountain of ice in North Atlantic seas for the sinking of the Titanic and the 1500 deaths. They built a ship the size of a city block and gave it a maiden voyage through freezing, iceberg-filled waters, without scouting ahead, without radio, and without installing enough lifeboats. People died because they couldn't find their way from their rooms to the upper deck! The iceberg is honestly in the right. But we've been blaming them & melting them anyway.
...what, like 40-50 people?   Uh, it was 1500.   :D Perfect bit. Screw you White Star Lines!! Build a better door!
SNL is so ovah... Time to move on... My relative died on that...not funny..doh...
needs to get an award for this
HIlarious, love this SNL player!
Hilarious! Bowen nailed it- again! 👏
i get the impression that iceberg has sex with other icebergs
This wouldn’t have worked with a straight iceberg.
I was in The Wizard Of Oz. They were NOT flying monkeys. They were hot air baboons.
Hilarious
I always forget SNL is still a thing. Who watches this trash.
Why is this as funny as NUMEROUS other sketch comedy shows that are no longer with us. SNL doesn’t deserve Bowen.
Yawn
I’m here to promote ... m y  a l b u m
SNL is so bad now they are apparently paying people to come in and laugh at their horrible skits. Talentless writing and stiif, pathetic performers.
Ice Ice Baby,  Cold As Ice, Frozen, Fire and Ice...so many directions.
Great performance! Really funny! Bowen has a bright future.
I love Bowen Yang!
Good jokes, up until he sang that awful song... :P
A clever send-up on Sia, Madonna, & Shangela ...
Entirely tasteless. Next weekend dress like c19 and shoot for laughs.
#IcebergDidNothingWrong
Hysterical. It's one of the best ever. This will be a classic.
,👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿
Heard Iceberg's "Music" is a 12 track, no skips of hyperpop/EDM/new disco fantasia. Can't wait for it to drop. Critics have said "Music" is better than Iceberg's debut album, "Chillin' in the Atlantic", which is a modern-day masterpiece.
This is cringe!
But like why do they make him play the same very character every time?
bowen kind of  disappoints me. I was excited to hear they were getting an Asian cast member fulltime. Regretted it the first time he opened his mouth, he's just the interchangeable "Gaysian" ( seriously, Mateo and him could be swapped at birth!).  The gay Asian man is such a caricature of themselves that's worn out it's welcome.
This is the funniest I’ve ever seen this dude. This is the most laughs I have ever seen him get on anything
Instant Classic
Pitch meeting: Bowen Yang: "I had an idea combining the tragedy of the Titanic & RuPaul's Drag Race.' Lorne Michaels: "...go on."
"They drowned bitch, that's not me, that's water" I was dying...laughing my ass off still.
His album is just 12 tracks of ocean/wave ambiance sounds.
Bowen Yang is absolutely fabulous. He is hilarious. Everything he does is great. I watch SNL right to see him. He does it effortlessly.
Bowen played it....   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ySb1f9zWJkQ
His gayness offends me. Sorry snowflakes!
this is very good
Unbelievably offensive.  Not only are they making fun of an extremely tragic even where 1500 people died but that man of color is in WHITE FACE which is racist as hell!
This shit was garbage how is this funny? Explain please someone
This is the new Stefan! I love this!
Brilliant
Sounds like a laugh track from an 80’s sitcom
“You came to where I live and you hit me!” Lol 🤣
Great sketch
Good job!
The blue lipstick kills it 🤣
I get the concept. But the execution just wasn’t funny.
Character demographic makes sense.  90% of the mortal hazard is just under the surface.
Really? This is supposed to be funny? They really have given up at SNL. This wasn't even funny enough to Crack a grin. To afraid to be canceled if they tell any real jokes. This had potential to be good but they played it so safe that it was just stupid.
This was not funny at all!!! Disrespectful to the many ppl who died!!! Very poor taste 💔🔥🌊
Why are people laughing?? This show was better 40 years ago. Lame.
I can’t believe in 2021 we’re still allowing Ice face.
When is the release date of the album: The iceberg that sank the Titanic - Music?
I think it's just him wanting to wear whiteface on tv. And as a white male, I love it!! Stop the hate, love is what we got!
Thank you for that question...lol
I love this guy, love this sketch..no political stuff, such a relief .Thank you!!
I’m screaming 😭😭😭
This is snl now. Sad
A gay iceberg..............nice!!!
I want that hat.
Bowman Yang is such a one dimensional character 😖
Funniest skit in decades
SNL sucks
The boring BS you can come up with when you don't want to talk about your guys in the white house is astounding. Hats off.
Did that song feel a bit lonely island to anybody else?
Genius!!! OMFG! I didn’t realize how much I needed this in my life! I can’t stop playing it and LMFAO! This is Everything! Thank you! 👑👑🦄🦄🔥🔥🔥
Wait . . . are you telling me SNL might be good again???  I stopped watching in '94.
I was waiting for a climate change joke.
Brilliant bit!
I LOVE THIS SO MUCH
I'll admit you were funny; but, was it necessary?  Given the nature of the event, the material was also tacky, insensitive, and profoundly shallow.  Anything for a laugh?    Have we lost any sense of lines that should not be crossed?  Any plans for the Lusitania anniversary in May?  And there's the Andrea Doria whoopsie in July.  Can we look forward to something on 9/11?
This is hilarious! Best sketch on weekend update in a long time. Perfect marriage of a bunch of great lines and a great comedian to deliver them.
The iceberg is gay,snl you have lost it.
It was a cool sketch idea but this really sank!
That diva power move, relinquish that authority sis @3:15
This is not funny how can you make a joke out of people dying I feel sorry for the victims families that have to go through this SMH
Someone in the comments is BOUND to say that iceberg's single is fire.
Saddest ripoff of Stefan
2:27 🤣
wow, why didnt i connect this earlier... the titanic wasnt sunk by a glacier... it was attacked for being near someone's territory. holy crap.
"they bumped into me.." i mean he's not wrong..
Lol, the gun didn’t kill him, he died cuz he bled out.
I love how Bowen almost breaks after Colin asks him about the album title again!
Cancel this lefties
I must have missed the part where over 1500 people dying is funny.  What's their next skit going to be next, the terrorist attack on September 11th?
LOL! I forgot how great it is when SNL is funny and tasteless at the same time! Of course, it wasn't about the Titanic but about interviews that go off the rails!
We can't say anything bad about the ICEBERG because of AAPI bashing.   LMAO!!!    OMG  Had no idea the ICEBERG was Asian.
Didn't Madonna have an album called Music?
Bowen has really come into his own this season. He's grown on me--I really like him this year!
_”And old people are like,spooning on the bed, ready to diiiie?!!!!”_ Nb: The headpiece and the song are just MAJESTIC. 😆😆
IM DEAD!! THIS WAS SOOO GOOD!!😂😂😂
Not funny.
The Iceberg needs to be on the Masked Singer.
"These are not the questions we discussed..." hilarious!!!
This guy is amazing
This guy has no range
How is this funny? I guess laugh tracks will laugh at anything
Too funny 😅🤣😂😆😅
He said "Oh my god. Their going to make a movie about this!"....lost it! 🤣🤣 🧊🧊
The dude on the right is like a man with a broken leg the way he uses his cue cards as a crutch. He worse than a high school theater student. The girl playing the iceberg was humorous.
I was cracking up!
love absurdity!!!
Bowen Yang's "Michael Jackson's TV Moonwalk" moment. I hope this character becomes a recurring character. The fusion of the writing and Yang's take on this character is fantastic!
Why isn't he a full cast member yet?
Wow, this is brilliant!
That was hilarious!  The writing for this show and the audience was a great combination!
Monty Python is jealous
Fricking brilliant
those women in the audience are TOO DAMN LOUD
OMG .....haven’t laughed so hard with a “guest” on the Weekend Update in a long time....this guy is so funny an into his art that it is a pleasure watch him every time but this skit is award winning !!! Let me rewatch again.....
Lol actually people r cancelling the ocean-they’re throwing trash & oil in it
Totally hysterical. Timing so perfect.
Too soon, Colin, too soon  😬
Like is this a Demi Lovato reference? Like TMZ taking her album promotion thing and turning it into A DMX overdose thing
I love Bowen Yang and he is the greatest thing to happen to SNL?  Who else can portray a malevolent iceberg, plus, well, everything else he does.  Seriously the best thing since the actual iceberg, or, you know, Pitbull did Timber, but it's possible that the iceberg yelled Timber as well as the ship cracked in half, so, 10:1 odds that Bowen is still better. <3
2:20 sounds like Lola from Big Mouth
Bowen is such a natural.
Any chance Berg becomes a regular character? Stranger things have happened on SNL
Is it true there is a link to the sinking of the titanic and the creation of the fed reserve???
“I said. ‘Oh, I’m sorry.’ Which is insane!” Lmao
Really funny!  A new perspective on a disastrous event
lmao is that white face?
i loved this so fucking much omg
He is the victim!! They hit him, bro deserves a lawsuit NOW!
Typical SNL! Making jokes off of death! Next stop in the twilight zone will be the Nazis!
It sank in 1912, couldn’t sit on this “gem” for another year? Ya know, the bigger anniversary?
This is such delightful writing... what was going through your head that night? ... I was reflecting... I was chilling... just all of it. Thanks for doing something truly original.
I like the Iceberg bring it back!
This is truly brilliant, I love it so much.
watched
This skit is just TOO DAMN GOOD
Why is ice berg gay?
Why is this reminding me of James Charles apology video? Lol is it just me 😭😭😭
wow amazing performance by the iceberg, ty you made my day
Its the same character... every skit... with different make up.
I didn’t know icebergs could be flaming!
You mean the boiler fire that sunk the titanic
Me: Wow, that was pretty rough, they must have been crazy short on time.  Me after reading the comments: Holy shit, people thought that was funny.   We're literally 2 years away from someone just walking out on screen and jangling a set of keys for 45 minutes.
It’s called MUSIC!
EMMY...!!!
Imagine in 100 years people making jokes about 9/11 since no one really has any memory of it. It will probably happen, people can learn to move past grief with humor, but really puts "offense" into perspective huh? What also puts offense into perspective is making fun of Irish culture when literally someone got kicked off the SNL writing cast for some stupid remark about asians a while back.  But none of this really matters. What matters is this sketch, and SNL, have not been funny in a long time.
That iceberg makes a good point; it was not his fault.
OMG Bowen! ❤️
This was the only funny part of this episode
Bowen is quickly becoming one of my favorite cast members! This was genius.
a gay iceberg. amazing
Yeah, I get why people would like this. And I get what's going on considering the current climate. However, I didn't find this particularly funny at all.
SNL hasn’t been funny for 20 years.  What do you people actually do?
This is hilarious!
He’s going to make it big. Guy has old school talent w/ new wave humor
I came here from an article that said this was the funniest SNL skit in years. I was definitely disappointed.
My ass was gone!!!! Bowen is amazing!
Gayploitation 101.
So the iceberg is gay? SHOCKER!!! If you want to get on tv or in a movie just tell them you're gay. There has has to be one in every movie these days. Entertainment has become a joke
I know the Iceberg and Bailey (Bailey from the movies) are BFFs.
So an Iceberg has a Publicist...I am done!
The adhesive brush contextually blind because kettle unfortunatly tire between a friendly dragon. hilarious, hideous high domain
Bowen is an American treasure, in case no ones said this yet.
Congratulations to the folks who designed and strategized this set. it’s one of the best SNL skits I’ve seen in a while! Kudos to this EGOT-energy talent from our favorite iceberg, Bowen🧊
This is stupid, are the comments curated or is your audience just brain dead?
People applauding "the iceberg that sunk the Titanic" is just weird.
White Star Line, you built a bad boat. That's on you, honey!
"What was going through your head?" Well the Titanic tried to...
OH, Goddess, sure need a good laugh like this in these crazy times!!  You ROCK Iceberg!!!
Not funny
Why are we still talking about the Holocaust while we are at it SNL??? Funny isn't it
fraxiom much
Lol you can see him mouthing "What did you think of my song?" at the end
3:07 🤣🤣🤣
can we have more iceberg, PLEEEASE I don't want this to be the last time I see this character, so hilarious!
the gay iceberg. gay. gay gay gay gay . wait what?
Of course that’s how he stereotypes Irish music.
JUST STOPPED BY TO DISLIKE WHAT KIND OF TITLE SND THUMBNAIL IS THIS. BOOMER HUMOR HOLY COW
Oh my gosh. He going to make me choke on my coffees ☕ 😆 🤣 😂 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
I really thought the iceberg was gonna be like, "I realized my actions have caused harm. I'm learning, I'm listening, and I'm going to take some time to reflect."
The Asian version of Dan Levy.
This transcends normal SNL comedy to something sublime.
Who wrote this sketch?
1:38 🤣🤣🤣
So funny, what's an iceberg to do? Big ship hits you, you are going to respond with a smackdown.
Lol 🤣🤣🤣
Bowen’s skit makes me a believer in SNL again!
Yangs best bit so far. Really made me laugh. Great concept.
I'm getting Martin Short vibes from this
Bowen’s entire vibe screams David from Schitt’s Creek and I’m obsessed.
Oops, do you mean the Olimpia?
I honestly don't find this dude funny at all.  SNL is slipping.
Brilliant!
Too soon.
The iceberg is right. Nobody's canceling the ocean! LMAO 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣
I don’t know if it’s racist, but is that the actor who played Lloyd on “Entourage?” 🤔
I feel like there was more under the surface that could have been examined....
Che with the Dmx shout out at the end, salute
The iceberg had some good points
This was a great bit
Who knew that the iceberg was a gay Asian!
I hope he continues this character but mix it up with different inanimate objects.
I am offended my great grandma died on the titanic
“Just tell us what was going through your head that fateful night.” How could he have missed the perfect come back to that question?: “The Titanic.“
😂😅🤣 YANG is Hilarious he is one of my favorite SNL Comedian! He and Kate are my favorites. MORE OF BOWEN YANG.
This was pretty fn great
His first time being funny...
Nobody's cancelling the ocean🤣🤣😭😭🤣🤣 and the death toll keeps going down too, OMFG🤦‍♂️🤣😭🤣
Best SNL skit since Samuri Deli.
Holy crap that was good.
Bowen gotta straight win an Emmy for this alone. He's always great, but he killed it with this.
god, bowen yang is the funniest person alive
He’s corny FR
So élégant.
"its a hyperpop, edm, new disco fantasia" i cant
funny funny funny....
This is the BEST!
The iceberg had me feeling sorrowful and sympathetic as he recalls that "painful" night. Naming a lettuce after him? WIC!! ( woefully inadequate compensation)
BOWEN ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
My sides hurt.
Worst SNL cast member ever. There have been some real stinkers, but this guy...
... slow news week i see
Watching Bowen is liking being on a coke & coffee diet. You know he's taking you to some strange place... & you wanna make sure you're still awake to appreciate it. 😳
Um we need a series of inanimate objects telling their experiences during famous events
A star has been born!!
Did Colin say "The iceberg from Satanic" at the end???
Bowen trying not to break on "yeah, it's called muSIC" is so choice
Costume is on point 😂
love you bowen!!!
I have 2 words to say to you, there are 7 letters. 3 of them are "F".
Make Bowen a full cast member, stat!
Love how they had to pan the camera up to get the full iceberg
Michael Che seemed so drunk at the end when he said goodnight
Bowen is a good comedian but as a comedic character on SNL.He has no range.I mean..His voice is the same for every character.He needs more range.I understand if Loren Michael’s is looking for diversity which he definitely was.But Bowen needs to change it up.I mean I could be wrong also.Maybe he is saying why must I be a pirate that says “Arrr”in the masculine sense.Maybe he’s representing the character’s that may have  been gay.
Apparently NOT too soon to make a joke! ;)
*An iceberg has more talent than Bowen!!*
There are so many other ways for SNL to be using this guy.  It’s almost 50 years out and they’re wasting this guy because he’s gay and Asian?
The BEST!
Imagine this being funny
wow imagine hosting SNL and this is the clip thats trending.
“IT’s COLD MUSIC!”
the over the top laughing audience makes this episode painful to watch. feels like a laugh track
“I was chilling.”
Bowen Yang is reliable. I like that about him. When he says "I'm not gonna be funny, ever, on SNL...", the guy delivers. Good for him.
Laugh track is killing.
I didn’t like this
Bowen Yang was KILLING me in this skit. So funny!!
Bowen is such a star
Che is awesome for saying “I’m Earl Simmons.” I peeped that.
MAKE THE ALBUM!!
i love bowen for almost breaking @ “YES, music..” priceless moment i don’t think he even saw that coming lol
She's the Kim Davis of iceberg lol haha
I can’t believe he’s wearing blue face 🙄 #canceled
Soooo glad he's a cast member now. He is gold!
Bowen Yang is So Important
Meh
It’s twelve tracks no skips swear to god
Well everyone’s talking about mEEE no ones talking about the WATERRRR! What did the autopsy say?? The iceburg did? no they drowned bitch that’s not me that’s water!
It shouldn't be "featuring Bowen Yang" anymore! He should be a primary player!
I would say this iceberg killed this skit but I’m sure his body count is pretty high already.
James Charles is the iceberg that killed all those people? And a singer?  And Asian?????????  Whaaaaaat?
This was hilarious
Bowen was the perfect person for this skit.
I was 💀 laughing 😂 at this.
Damn, the iceberg actually had some valid points. lol
Why does it sound like the crowd is being paid to laugh, and there over doing it?
I feel sooo bad I never thought about how the titanic changed this poor iceberg forever.
Cancel the iceberg, it’s made of water
The iceberg got hit BY A SHIP and apologized for it. That IS crazy. The Titanic should be the one apologizing.
Marked “liked” before even hearing it !!!!
It’s a good thing I wasn’t in the audience because I would have SCREAMED
Cancel the iceberg, it's made of water
Cancel the iceberg, it’s made of water
Best sketch 2021 😂😂
The ice berg sounds like the lady who tackled a young boy claiming that he stole her phone. 🙄
the song actually slapped tho
Bowen Yang is my favorite cast member right now.  Freaking brilliant.
That song slaps tho lol
The "stonks" equivalent of comedy
BWWWAAHAHAHA!! This was one of the best skits I've ever seen on SNL and I'm... well... old.. so I've seen a LOT of SNL skits. Bowen Yang was hysterical!
He’s easily my favorite cast member, ever.
“THAT’S NOT MY NAME-UH!”  Exactly how I imagined an iceberg to sound like
I want that album.
It was fine when it left Belfast 🤣
This was brilliant. How did he make such an old non-topic so damn funny?
The Iceberg with an attitude!!!🤣😩🤣😩🤣
They didn't drown, they froze
The iceberg be looking real different these days
Okay, but I WANT that album.
Yea..Bowen Yang ain't going no where for a while..SNL has a gem on their hands..
THIS WILL BECOME A WEEKEND UPDATE CLASSIC!  Your performance Bowen on this skit ranks up with Adam Sandler's Opera Man and Bill Hader's Stefon. You have definitely moved up to an SNL A-lister!
I love this satirical take on the mass media's silence over the genocide occurring in China against Muslim citizens right now XD Spot on.
Was this supposed to be funny? I couldn’t even feign a chuckle from this
I like the writer of this on Twitter saying writing this gave me the stupidest joy' lol.
SNL lost easy material after 4 years, but gained a “SUPERSTAR” I haven’t laughed that hard in a while.
I think it's the simmering hatred of Colin that makes this work
Where can I get the album?
Did Michael Che do a dmx tribute
This is hilarious!
0:35 🤣🤣🤣🤣ded
Wow SNL has truly been shit for a while now.
He's the Asian version of Dan Levy
Chose this over Shane Gillis, huh?
My stones fell off the edge of water my god run
So SNL decided to start being funny again? Thanks Biden!
And I was looking at this and said, "omg, they're going to make a movie about this" 🤣🤣
Dead or Alive is back!
Omg.  This was one of the highlights of the show.  So well done Bowen Yang is hilarious🤣.
Is he in white face? How racist is that?
“ Then I turn around and Old people are spooning on a bed waiting to die” 😂😂😂 what a way to capture the famous movie scene 😂😂
Don't know who SNL music guest was just caught the end was that dude wearing a dress WTF!
This was an awful skit. Did not laugh.
“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming
OMG! This is brilliant! 😂 Lmfao
omg fucken hilarious
1k before my b day?? July 13th..
More Iceberg Bowen please.
Is this the best they can do? Pathetic.
“Why are you attacking meeeeeaaaa?” “No one is canceling the ocean!” LOL!!!
Ya all suck not even funny thumbs down
OMG this is hillarious.
Iceberg or is this the ghost of Liberace.
Genius
I should be a writer for SNL. “What was going through your head that night?” “A big boat, Collin!” LOL! Extremely missed joke opportunity.
This is what SNL has SUNK to? pathetic.
👎👎👎👎👎
Love, loved, this! So good! Thank you!!! Laughed & laughed!  Talent!!! 🥳🥳🥳
This guy never acts bc he can't. He just is himself. Every single character he plays is the same. He sucks!!
I have literally been singing that song all day
Iceberg: Can we talk about my album?  Colin: Cool.  Me: You can't say that word, Colin. That is their word
stupid
This is classic SNL absurdist comedy and I AM HERE FOR IT!!!
Parodying interviews? An original character? A musical number? This skit is a three-in-one.
That underhand Sia drag
This iceberg character is very funny.
One wouldn't think joking about the Titanic would be funny but 😃😄😂😂😂
I hope they make more of this!
"Nobody said 'they icebergded! They drowned bitch!'"
This is stupid.
Please have him play David Rose on a Schitt’s Creek sketch!! He would kill it!!
That slaps
Bowen is a treasure
Nor funny
“I’m Earl Simmons.” 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺RIP DMX 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
I loved the reference to the David Letterman interview at the start.
After coming close multiple times, Bowen finally knocked it out of the fucking park! Great work!
🧡 The Iceberg does make a good point.
3:54 I think we just saw a gay man achieve his dream😄
Remember when Bowen Yang was even remotely funny? Yeah....me NEITHER
In all due fairness, icebergs are made of water, so technically his father was responsible.
That’s whiteface. Racist and not funny at the same time.
it takes a real queen
I pressed "play" ready to hate on the stupid premise,  but this was pretty good.
Why are people mad about this? I seriously don't understand
Omg y'all's non political stuff is awesome! I died
Oh my god 😂
John 3:16-17 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9- That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10- For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen!
As a personal injury attorney,  please call me to discuss your case. 1500 victims? Uh no. They hit you! Negligence all day! And they kept going. Failure to render aid. Call me!
When you have such a lack of range you even play an iceberg as yourself lol
Annnnd... just like that I have my 2021 halloween costume.
15 years from now and no context later Bowen will be canceled for wearing white face.
I know what my next Halloween costume is gonna be now
This skit was not funny. And not funny because of any political crap either. It was simply not funny.
that outro, "What did you think of my song?" "It was good!"
Oh wow, a gay stereotype character. This is so hilarious and groundbreaking
HAHAHAHA FUNNY 😄 😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING ME ..  .HAHAHA
Benny Sings actually did just drop an album called "Music" on Friday.
On April 15, 1912 the RMS Titanic sank in the North Atlantic. It's nice to finally hear the iceberg's side of the story.
I am offended that they used an Asian person
But you are made of water...
Half my ass was gone🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😅😅😅😅😅😅
PLEASE give this man an Emmy!!!
"What did the autopsy report say, they icebergded?! No, they drowned bitch!"
Wow. So sad SNL has absolutely no morals. Let's make fun of death and destruction.  Liberals are all about the people and love and diversity.  But all I see is hate and indifference.  Sad. Freedom of speech still should have morals and knowing that ideology has limits. Stop flooding media with political hatred and your ideas. You do a disservice too yourselves.
This deserves an award 🏆😂👌🏻
LOVE BOWEN YANG!
I wonder what percent of the SNL comedians/ actors are good singers. It seems a high percent and going up,
Brilliant 🤣
Why didn't SNL just cast an Asian woman, This guy has no range.
This is SOOOO GOOD! 💀💀💀💀
In 100 years I hope someone does this with COVID...
An SNL skit hasn't made me snort this hard in a while
This is up there with the least funny SNL skits I've ever seen.
This is one of the best sketches I've ever seen on SNL. I don't who wrote this but they were either baked AF or delusional from being up late writing. Y'all stupid for this one 😂😂😂😂😂
This needs millions of views!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ok you came to where I lived and hit me. It was midnite  and I was chilling and something hit me. And then I lost half of my ass. No one blame the water-ppl not death because of icebergded-they drown! My album called music. 🤣
Hilarious!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 what about the water?!? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Looks like what happened with Titanic was just the tip of the ice berg
The east coast version was funnier than this one (the west coast one) but it’s still funny as hell!
This was not funny at all.  Pathetic and reaching.
Great comedic timing by both of them.
That was dumb.
This was brilliant!
Not funny. Tacky and irritating.
White face oh ooh racists
"You came to where I lived and you hit me!" EVERYONE: *FACTS!*
He looks like he’s wearing straight off the runway COMME DES GARCON
I bet the iceberg's favorite movie is FROZEN !!!!! 😂
I’m Earl Simmons goodnight! Good tribute Michael Ché
#EmmyForBowen
This was hilarious af.
that had no business being as good as it was. bowen is such a star.
Iceberg Realness needs to be a runway on RPDR
"That"s not my name!"
this is so fucking funny what the SDNRJFELWK>S
This guy has never made me laugh.
MORE BOWEN PLEASE
That was some great unique humor all around! Awesome skit 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Im sorry but who tf was that in the audience laughin like that?! Like I deadass wanted to cuss her out & I wasn’t even there 😂 she on every skit wit that fake ass nasally ass laugh 😂
Nobody’s talking about his song!
Funny❤️
Another stupid one last night
I love Bowen, he’s hilarious!!
So wrong, but why am I laughing,  even if I didn't get the end "song"
despacito
So are we going to get the 12 track no skip album SNL or what?
Bowen = SNL Treasure!
They drowned bitch... That's not me... That's Water.... 😆 He's a great actor.
Thank you for setting the record straight. 🙏
They should’ve brought on Chris Parnell as a surprise guest star, reprising his role as Charles Joughin, the ship’s baker who rode the stern into the water and swam to the overturned lifeboat. He would’ve been the witness for the defense an say that the ship was weak sauce.
Cancel this show. It hasn't been funny in years.
I like the new guy he is really funny but snl sucks now
Is he in any movies?? Cuz he deserves to be the star of one🌟
Can’t help but think how fcking hot Collin is!
# defund baseball
I think San Francisco's "Beach Blanket Babylon" would like to speak to the maker of that head dress
“I was chilling”. Clever.
What went through your head that night?  Ah, the Titanic.
Bowen Yang is NOT FUNNY in the least
jost had a lot of trouble not completely losing it
smh. People will laugh at anything.
I don’t care if Bowen doesn’t have a ton of range. What he does he does brilliantly.
What did Che say at the end there?
Thé iceberg reminds me of Lola from Big Mouth
GOD I LOVE THIS!!! I ADORE BOWEN.
The only way this could be better would be if they had added the red streak of paint that was said to be left on the iceberg
This is one of the best weekend update skits I've seen in a long time omg. No one is doing it like Bowen Yang 🔥🔥
Chillin testimony 🤣
Missed opportunity to throw in a climate change joke somewhere about the melting icebergs, but otherwise this sketch is gold!
"thanks for having me. this is always a really weird time for me."
How do you even think of something like this? lmao this is genius
Love this skit! Clever!
1514 people drown. Imagine 1500 poc died and a white man wore black face to make fun of the tragedy #HoldTheLeftToTheirOwnStandards
Brilliant🔥
A new classic! So creative! Costume is amazing!
the bits they have him doing are getting so much better recently
Seriously, I adore him.
And like, the Emmy goes to bow and yang!
You KNOW it's funny when Colin and Bowen can't stop laughing in their own skit and-- Wait, yeah, the whole cast does that all the time in everything. Way to pro.
"First of all, you came to where I live and you hit me!"
idk too soon
He is so not funny, in any skit. Lose this loser.
Love when Bowen Yang gets surreal
Will snl ever be funny again? The struggle is real with the current material
I have watched this on repeat so many times and I just can't can't stop.   This is hilarious and addicting.  I have laundry to do.  I need to take a shower.  I need to feed my dog who has been sitting next to me for the last hour so patiently.  Bowen, you are killing me!
So cute!!🏔️💙
Beta berg?
ICEBERG _________  SANK TITANIC    and it just kept getting better after that!
When God spoke to my right ear from Heaven and said, you are Rain. I asked for a Rainbow. I know that Rain falls from the sky and shivers and makes icebergs. July, 7.11 let's see if frogs fall from the sky lifted by water spouts to fall in a symbolic place. God is onto us. I am his puppet, spellbound. He my ventriloquist.  🤣🤪⚓🌈🍎
I haven’t laughed so hard in while 😂 #victim #savetheicebergs
I was half expecting him to burst into a joker monologue
Yes!
I feel You iceberg sis!
That was PERFECT!
This is classic SNL..no one is talking about the water!!  Hilarious!!
Seems like they are layering in laugh tracks now.  No way some of that was as funny as they made it sound.
This and "LaTony Garage".
Who'd have thunk an iceberg would steal the night from the rest of the SNL cast.  Good job here.  F-U-N-N-Y!
What's next, "Zyclon B" interview for the release of it's new fitness program? Yep animating a subject that caused horror for comedic value is rife with problems, with deliverance, interaction and content either making it very successful or not, Sorry fellas, this one missed the mark.
I need the name of the SNL person that made the iceberg headpiece...PRONTO!! I’m calling dibs on it NOW...I’ll wear it EVERYWHERE!!
I liked his music. Put it on Spotify
unapologetic iceberg. #BowenYang is genius.
Ok I actually like his song? Why is no one talking about it
Sort of digging the asymmetrical ice doo. Very 2008.
Who thinks of this stuff? 😄
That Sai dig was just what I needed ❤  love it
Is the iceberg reenacting the BLM President/movement? Don’t bring the facts up, how dare you offend me by bringing it up. I’m offended.
I'm here to promote my album.
Too soon!!!
Bowen is killing it😂
That “hat” belongs in the Smithsonian!
I never knew that I needed something so badly.
I mean, Iceburg is kinda right.
Lincoln Project meets SNL! 😂
😂😂😂😆😆🤣 I laughed for the longest time... this skit 😆😂👌🏾!!! I've loved SNL since the 70s!💕
"It didn't work out, that's on you, honey" why so cold Atlantic iceberg
Bowen is a genius!
The “sinking” 😂😂
well he is right
Love this skit! One of my new favorite characters!
Now this was funny🤭
This kind of skit it why it's worth watching all the crap that SNL puts up these days.  Hilarious.
not funny at all so fucking stupid george floyd dying was funnier to me
It has been some time since i've seen such a funny snl skit. Lmao yang nailed it, like Jesus the carpenter.
Geezuzfknchr*st! This bit is beyond hysterical!
One character that should return and also they should make a music video with one of this character songs lol
Sooooo.... Is Loverboy on iTunes or nah?
If you want to see more Bowen’s greatness, please watch Nora from Queens. He’s absolutely funny there as well.
I didn't find it funny, and it's not funny to make jokes in an accident where 1,500 people lost their lives.  Just not funny.  Pretty soon they will be laughing about 9/11 tragedies.  Have some empathy and compassion.
Why when I see the iceberg it reminds me of Sir Elton John!
Bowen - this is a great sketch man! Keep on rockin'!
Halfway through I’m thinking “well he does have a point, why is Colin giving him such a hard time” and then I realize I just sided with an iceberg 🤔
Why is this funny!  People died! People's families died! And now it's this funny!
Cringe.  Is this what normies find funny in 2021?
Not half his ass!! And that was his best figure
I didn’t like this skit. Not funny.
An album?? 😂😂
Perhaps they should have just performed Les Barker’ s “Have You Got Any News of the Iceberg.” Would have been funnier.
Protect Bowen at all costs!!!
Best skit of the night
“I’m Earle Simmons, Goodnight!”  🙏🏾❤️😢
Iceberg made some valid points
Love Bowen Yang, great segment, super original
Can he do this for all kinds of natural disasters??!
Instant Classic!
20 or 30 people or whatever 🤣🤣🤣❤
Bowen Yang is actually pretty damned funny... .Now if you could get some writers to hand out 'the luv' to him....
SNL DYING WIYHOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP,buyers remorse about joe mansion.
This was actually hailArious
Is this supposed to be a rip on Sia and her Music debacle? The defensive and dismissing attitude, the large head piece, and the album is called Music? If so, it's an interesting way to address what she has done.
He's the best thing to happen to this show in like forever.
“You came to where I lived, and hit me.”  That sass though
"What was going through your head that night?" "A BOAT, COLIN."  Missed opportunity.
Wow, talk about forced Diversity...and this is what follows 99/100, Horrid.
I think the writers just walk around the prop room to come up w ideas now
Too soon....that's cold...
Sorry im siding with the iceberg.
This is easily some of the funniest ish of this particular SNL season. Bowen Yang str8 killed this bit...LMAO!!! I was never fazed by the so-called tragedy of the Titanic, and now I understand why because the 'Berg is right. It was THE OCEAN that drowned those people, and it was the incompetence of the ship's navigator that caused the ship to collide with the 'Berg in the 1st place.   Real talk: It's really no different than a bear that happens to maul and kill a human who was camping in the bear's home (the forest); there are risks involved.  No wait: When he said 'They Iceberg-ded'...that line did me in. LMBO!!!
New documentary coming to Netflix:  "Framing The Iceberg"
“What was going through your head that night?”  “The Titanic.”
I enjoy how much he sounds like Lola from Big Mouth
This was a miss for me, "what's wrong with this picture" sketch though.... that was GOLD!
hyperpop
really funny and clever...up there with the great SNL sketches
Sounds like a new pop singer 🙂🤣 😂
Best News guest in a while..the song was the cherry
Does every character Bowen plays have to be gay?
Oh this is why Bowen looked so pale during the GenZ Star Trek skit
Bowen Yang is so funny!!!!! "Why are you attacking me?"!!  "These are not the question we ducussed". He just said these words and i think i already died laughing!!! :D
Reminded me of James Charles' apologies . . . LMAO
Omg this was hilarious! 😆 😂😂😂
BRILLIANT BOWEN!!!
Lol, how do they come up with these things?
What was going through your head that fateful night ?  Titanic ? *Ba dum tss*
Legend!
What your average tragedy looks like in 100 years
Did anyone else notice in the live show how quickly Bowen got ready for the Star Trek sketch right after?! You can see him running into the set during the commercial break and barely making it just before it started. Everyone else is already there. There’s still some white make up on his face, specially on his eye brows. And he goes on to deliver his lines flawlessly. That’s commitment. It’s the magic of live theater for you! Amazing!
I miss comedy...
"You said you would be my opraaaah!" "No I didn't." "Well someone did!"
It really troubles me that the tiles in the background are not matching up straight...
Stop force feeding us asians !!!!!! It's counter productive
Just a little slice of genius, right here. 🤣
Stop force feeding us asians !!!!!! It's counter productive
Best sketch!
😂😂😂😂😂
Mr. Yang is becoming must watch television.
First of all, you came to where I live and YOU hit ME!
to quote jay leno re the movie Titanic -  (people went to see it over and over and over ...)   "i can save you $5.00 tonight.  The boat sinks."
OK but the song is actually a tune
If I don't see an emmy nomination I'm gonna explode.
Its  hard to admit but the ice berg is right. They did smash into its ass lol
It’s 12 tracks, no skips! swear to God 😂😂
This was really funny. The writers did a great job. The actor was hilarious on why the water didn't get blamed.
He killed 1500 of the 2240 passengers/crew onboard. Shame on NBC for this platform!
LEAVE THE ICEBERG ALONE 😭😭 SNL IS CANCELED
I love Bowen a fantastic addition to the cast
Bowen Yang performances are growing on me... "The -What-er"
Anyone else feel like they need that album
“They bumped into me, and I said ‘oh, I’m sorry,’ which is, INSANE.” LMAO
I just watched Titanic last night.
You know it was good when you want a skit to return even though it wouldn’t be as funny anymore.
#TeamIceberg Stay out his house next time and you won’t get hit 😂😂😂
So funny 😄
This went on a good 4 minutes too long.
Great Long video ! So funny 🤣
Dear Jeebus in Hebben.... please make those songs a the music videos to go with them and make this the "landshark" of the 2020s.
8/10 idea, 11/10 execution.
The iceberg looks good for his age.
This is stupid.
The intelligent link postprandially start because gold splenomegaly inject forenenst a parched connection. cultured, nervous gladiolus
He's def becoming a main cast member...🥰
The funny thing is White Star did build a faulty ship. There were reports that water was already seeping into parts of the ship mid voyage. I hope they make a dark comedy about how things really played out. Just saying , only the first class passengers were informed first .
ok but the song low key slaps
i didnt want to like this but i did. fml
Boweng is a genius, but I do not think he will be as good as Kate. But because his performance, just his race. There are simply not so many characters for him to play. Unlike white , black and Latino
Did I really just watch a man dressed as an iceberg sing a techno song?
Everyone should appreciate Bowen Yang for making us think twice about the tragedy of titanic 👏
Was that a laugh track???
Bowen is doing a great job. He has become a bright spot in an otherwise average season.
Upon reflection, the iceberg has been getting a really bad rap this whole time. Definitely seeing things in a new light.
This was so good 😂😂😂
He killed it.  So funny.
this was legendary!
to have bowen who is asian say he got hit nowadays seems more than a comedy bit
Bowen is best boy 😭
What's next the Krakatoa volcano Vesuvius. Or my st helens volcano's 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Thought the album featured ICE ICE baby
This is so epic funny
Horrible and sick. Typical of younger tasteless generation.
this is the first skit I like this dude in.
Sorry Iceberg but Madonna was the first one to have an album called "Music" back in 2000. Go sink yourself HAHA
In very poor taste.
this guy was a diversity hire who checked 2 boxes....has NO business on this show....oh I forgot SNL is a hate factory now so it doesn't matter
Still too soon!
I switch channels when Yang comes on.  He is a one-note actor who isn't funny.  Even though he is openly gay, his schtick is always the same, bordering on the homophobic.  It's outdated and offensive.
So friggen funny wow
THIS IS GOLD!!
The iceberg is giving me the exact same vibes that all the people who worked with woody Allen do. With the not talking about it and the lame ass excuses.
💀😭🖤💜🤣SUCH A PERFECT WEEKEND UPDATE!!! And so many badass comments! THANKS ALL!
An Asian guy wearing white face paint? That's white face. I'm offended. (A joke)
OMG! "Before I turn around, half my [butt] is gone!"
Funniest skit ever😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣🤣
We Stan Bowen!
Lmaooooo they drowned beach, cancelling the ocean,  I needed this 🚶🏾‍♀️#walkamerica 🚶🏾‍♂️
Okay, but that songs slaps
didnt know the iceberg titanic hit was a pick me girl 😳
Can I just say that this LUUUEK is EVERYTHING!!! Like the Hunger Games drip is calling to me. 😆🧊
bowen has been such a blessing to snl i swear
THIS IS THE MOST BRILLANT SKIT IN YEARS!!! BOWEN YOU ARE THE MASTER!!!
Brilliant!
“Commentary from the iceberg that the Titanic struck?’  ONLY SNL could come up with this & make it something to laugh at!
He really does play the Liberace of icebergs. To freaking funny 😂 & hell yes it was the waters fault!
It was midnight I WAS CHILLING
The only segment that was funny this week-- but it was epic. 😆
bOWEN!!!!
Wow, facts.... leave the berg alone.
Bowen Yang is now a national treasure.
Bowen is SNL's treasure - what a comedian
The ice looks like shaving cream lol
This is honestly one of the funniest skits I've seen in awhile 🤣
It wasn't an iceberg that fatally weakened the Titanic. It was an insurance job. Do the research, please don't come back at me. Just informing.
Who thought this was a good idea?
Best of the night
uh ok
that suit... vanilla ice?
This was brilliant
This was so good!
Irish cacophony hahaha
This long hard metal thing rammed me in my ass! Oh wait - that's a good thing.
Bowen Yang is such a great addition to the cast 🤣
This is woke society in a nutshell
😂😂😂
“I’m Earl Simmons Goodnight” that was awesome
Why are all of his characters flamboyant? Is he trying to communicate something? LOL
BOWEN STOLE THE WHOLE SHOW
To soon?
💙 I love Bowen Yang
He's hilarious. What's his name?
this sketch is genius
If Bowen is not nominated for an Emmy next year there is no justice in this world.
I love Bowen endlessly
I love Bowen so much, he never fails to crack me up
I miss Leslie Jones on the weekend update!
They weren't iceburged!
Hey SNL writers maybe bring on other family and friends of the ICEBERG who were impacted the night the Titanic hit it!  Did all of the Berg survive or did it have casualties too?
His logic is sound 😜
okay but i desperately want to hear to the iceberg’s hyperpop album
This is extraordinary!
Too soon SNL. Too soon
The more I see this Bowen Yang guy, the funnier he gets.
This iceberg makes some very good points: "you came to where I live and you hit me!... they drowned bitch...nobody's cancelling the ocean... Hey white star line, you built a bad boat!" All facts! 😂😂😂
Easily the worst cast member in a long rime
Too Soon... :v
That iceberg looks fantastic for being well over 100 years old
Hysterical!!!!!
The audience must be drunk to be laughing that hard
Yep.  No filter here. Next week on SNL! The FAMOUSLY tall twins from New York talk about those pests called "Air Planes" that ran into them when they were just standing there minding their own business! Next week on SNL.  Be sure to tune in
He has excellent comedic timing, especially in gauging the audience's reaction.
He just gets to wear white face?
FUCK...HAD TO CLEAN MY KEYBOARD AND SCREEN.... SPIT MY COFFEE OUT... HIIIIIILARIOUS!!!
My goodness SNL is so incredibly unfunny now.
The Iceberg has got to be a recurring character, that was over the top funny as hell, Bowen was superb in every way!  Don't blame it on me the Iceberg, blame it on the water, they drowned!  LMAO
this is brilliantly good — when SNL used to be funny.
"Omg, they're going to make a movie about this" -- best line
Bowen Yang totally nailed this segment... it's so fukkin funny! 😂
"What was going through your head that fateful night?" - "The Bridge ..."
Best act of the night
"Hey, White Starline. Ya built a bad boat.  It didn't work out. That's on you, honey." Omg, this whole piece was brilliant!
So good & funny, watched it twice!! Haven't done that in forever for SNL!
Irish cacophony 😆
This chick is hilarious, who is she?
12 tracks no skips 😂
Colin: "You called it MUSIC?!?!?!?"  Madonna: "And I took that personally."
Making light of the titanic sinking.. Right on writers,you’re doing great work here... Just fantastic
I love the fact the Iceberg is a 100% flamboyant gay man channeling his inner Stephon.
can’t wait for the album
I love him
“The bump into me.......which is insane btw”
Waiting for Halloween to see this as a costume. Giving us David S. Pumpkins vibe.
Them both trying not to laugh had me rolling
Too soon.
Should this guy play other character types?
So no-one is going to say it’s what’s under the surface??? 🤣
Dear I Say... #$%@ Iconic! Encore! Encore!
They took the first part from the carrie prejean interview with Larry king I’m dead
2:56 the best part
Yang!!!!!  LOVE YANG!!!  Always GREAT!
I am RIP, this is everything I didn’t know I needed, from the IRISH CACOPHONY and BLAME THE WATER, I sent this to everyone I know and they are all on the floor!!! Bowen Yang is my new unsung hero!!!!
😆
"I feel very attacked!"
Bowen's flamboyance ruins another skit. At least the iceberg that sank the Titanic only did its damage one night.
Loved seeing Fran Lebowitz as an iceberg
Brilliant.
The innuendo is vast with this one 😎😆
OMG this!
Bowen Yang is perfection!!!😂🤣❤️
Honestly if you look into what actually caused the titanic to sink, it's not just the shoddy building work that was done with the second half of the rivets and such on the back side. It's also the fact that they changed one of the main officers at last minute since he had never been in charge of something so large. Since it was changed just as the ship was about to leave port, he had to gether all of his things from around the ship. As he got home he realized that he had left with the key to the closet that housed most if not all of the binoculars on board. Meaning the crows nest had nothing to work with.  So basically cheap craftsmanship on behalf of the company, and the last minute change to the second in command officer who was in such a hurry he forgot to leave the key.  I cant even imagine the way that man felt when he found out why the ship sank...life long guilt im sure.
i'm such a titanic fanatic and this is the funniest shit i've ever seen
I’m sorry this really isn’t funny.
I think it’s a little crude to make jokes about the titanic when hundreds of people died a painful horrible death
Bowen ♥️♥️♥️
The Iceberg had all those years to get booked on Deep House Dish and had to wait until a Weekend Update in 2021 for airtime??  SOMEONE’S publicist needs to get fired, ASAP!
I’m dead
Soooo funny. I’m dying.
i'm really offended to see a character in blue face.
This is exactly how I’ve always imagined the Iceberg would sound like!
this is not that funny ngl
SNL = Sorry Not Laughing
Pure genius!  "You said you would be my Opraaaah, Colin!"  Even more entertaining than the actual Oprah/ice princess interview!!!
Ice ice baby...wait wrong generation...lol
3:06 LOLOL
...white face... what about when a white person wants to do a skit about an avalanche and has to have a brown face as dirt... lol... seriously
More Bowen!
So what's up with the white face?
Che signing off as Earl Simmons. Kudos.
😂😂😂
How was this so damn funny. I can’t wait to listen to music the album.
We need a follow up to hear the Ocean's side.
Funniest of the night
This is fucking amazing
"You said you would be my Oprah, Colin!" So good!
“They drowned bitch!” Lmao!
link to stream song plz tysm 🤲 💃
Oh what the hell
these weekend update sketches were the best shit of the show omg 😭😭
From the picture I misjudged this one hugely.  This was funny.
Finally something fresh
“it’s 12 tracks, no skips swear to god” HAHA
Missed a perfect joke there. "What was going through your head that fateful night?" - "An 800 foot boat".
😄😄😄😄
Many fans of Bowen in the comments but I don't see it. The caricature gay delivery of his lines is a cheap alternative to having his own voice and style. Been there done that.
This is genuinely one of the funniest bits I’ve seen. Blew my mind
Bowen is the only thing keeping snl afloat, let’s be real
omg the subtle vanessa hudgens dig
Chilling portrayal!
comment 1234
I didn't know icebergs could be so gay
😂🤣
Did SNL get new writers because these past 2 weeks have been hilarious skits! Keep it up!
AWESOME 😂😂😂
Bowen Yang is the most ICONIC snl member of all time
This skit had great potential but wasn't that funny.
I thought this wouldn't work, but it might be the best desk piece they've done this season.
Why is no one talking about the ocean?   Great point.
This guy is the funniest person on SNL
I'm dying...that was great. "And now everybody, the iceberg from Titanic!"  I named my iPod Titanic. It's syncing now.
wow the iceberg is having an emotional melt down?
Bowen's iceberg looks like a cool Liberace!
This is the dumbest idea for a sketch ever. That’s why it works.
God this was so good
Bowen & Eggo are the best new editions to SNL. He's been killing it on  Weekend Update since his first appearance as the Chinese Trade Ambassador
That was fantastic. He needs to do more  skits like this. 👍
Hahahahahahaha this was amaziiing!!!!!
SNL is sooooo unfunny! Sux
That iceberg is a fake the proper iceberg that sunk the Titanic was on Harry Hill's TV Burp over ten years ago. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvwoGTgj0DA
This was hilarious. Shout out to Michael Che for: “I’m Earl Simmons...” RIP DMX
super wack
Bowen is truly the BEST part of SNL
to be fair, we aren't canceling icebergs because of the titantic, we're canceling them becuase we like  cold air conditioning and driving cars
Yang is the best.
Weekend News Update was popping. Loved the stripper and the iceberg.
wow, this is so funny making a joke out of a tragic event
Absolutely hilarious!! LOL Thank you Bowen..and what a great nāaame he has, 🤣 on top of his genius talent...very creative. wow!
That was main cast member good. Move him up SNL
I thought Pineapple was going to be the newest character and highlight for the Weekend Update and then this happened and I almost died laughing
Best skit of the show. Bowen Yang is genius!
12 tracks no skips, swear to God💯🤣
that song legit slaps
That song lowkey is a bop.
Amazing
so the ice bergs gay
This is amazing 😂
that was brilliant.
omg Bowen Yang is genius-level hilarious!  YEAH!!!!!
Is Bowen Yang the go-to closer for Weekend Update?
The cold hard truth is hard to deal with.  H2OMG that was funny!
That shit was ice cold baby
No one’s cancelling the ocean!🤣🤣🤣
“Irish cacophony” got me. 😆
Bowen again killed it!
Funniest skit of the night, imho.
matt rogers had better be showering bowen with praise for THIS performance on las cultch this week i s2g 😤
Bowen Yang is a national treasure lol
"I'm Earl Simmons Goodnight!" Nice subtle tribute
Yang is my favorite SNL cast member, so freaking funny every time 😂😂😂
“”WATER!!”.....U BUILT A BAD BOAT”
It's like, gay on ice...
Not to rain on everybody’s parade, but it’s coming out  more and more that the titanic was actually sunk purposely to get rid of societies most prestigious, good and successful people. All of their businesses got taken over by the cabal and today are some of the most well-known companies in the world run by the cabal. They basically put all of high Society’s most prominent in one place and got rid of them. Sorry not sorry SNL. We all know you are part of controlling the narrative. That’s why you’re not very funny. Better plant the titanic seed in peoples minds before it comes out more huh?
Thing is, it all makes sense about what happened.
🤣🤣
This was hilarious and clever.
This was the only funny segment on the Weekend update. Bowen Yang deserves his own show.
My ancestor died on the Titanic. Not funny.
I will never be able to look at the womens hats in the movie Titanic the way I used to!
That was smooth...like ice!
This clip actually had me cackling like the wicked witch. That so rarely happens with snl these days. Well done!
LMAO!!!🤣🤣🤣🚢
“Like, sorry that 30 or 40 people died, or whatever...”
OMG...it was the water and Frankenstein was the creator, of the monster, not the actual monster.
NO ONE IS CANCELLING THE OCEAN!
this feels like it was partially inspired by James Charles' apology video
A low water mark for the show. SNL RIP.
“I’m The Ding Of The Wuuurrrlllld!”
The sinking will turn 109 years old on #WednesdayApril15th?!!!!!! LOL
Every youtuber apology video ever
the song actually is really good
The iceberg reminds me of Dan Levy’s Schitts Creek character 😂
Best Bowen of the season!
I liked this more than I thought I would!
He’s got soooo much range! All of his characters are gay. lol
Best SNL skit in years! Props to the costume designer. I lived in KY for over 10 years and that's a Derby Hat for real. 😄
They missed a joke right at the start. It should have been:  Jost: "What was going through your head that fateful night?"  Iceberg: "What was going through my head? Helloooo? A ship!"
bowen yang and redd are truly making this season worth it
the iceberg should've sued the titanic XD
He's a genius
Bowen is THE best 💓
OMG!! He's in Whiteface! That's soooo racist!!!!!
BOWWEENNNNN <3
Funniest skit since forever on SNL 😃 Love, love, loved it 🤣
You can sometimes pinpoint exactly when someone has a star making breakthrough moment. This is one of those times. 😂
Who would give this a thumbs down??? Please have Bowen Yang in more skits he killed this one!
I can't wait for people to come out saying they were  descendants of the people who died. And how this offended them. These wackos look for something every hour. And of course I am sad about what happened.
Low key best skit I have seen in years!!!
I would buy that song 😂😂😂
Great shout out to DMX , Earl Simmons. Che
No ones talking about the WATEEEEEEERRRRR! LOOK AT THE AUTOPSY REPORT!😂😂😂😂
😍😍😍😍😍🤣🤣🤣🤣
They "icebergded" l
Everyone always asks where is the iceberg, not how is the iceberg.
I need this album. Give it to me. Please.
STILL, nobody thought it was insurance fraud???
Bowen Yang is by far one of the worst cast members in SNL history. The guy simply isn't even slightly funny. What a waste of space.
Gold.
This was so creative. Loved it ❤
Omg he’s amazing
His song needs a weird little flute.
Is this puppet history without the professor?
"Lover Boy" is absolutely gonna be the song of the summer
This is Hysterical!🤣🤣🤣🤣
How did this get on the air? Terrible
this is one of the most clever skits ever. love this.
“I’m earl simmons good night” RIP DMX 🙌🏻
"Half my ass is gone" - best delivery of this line 😂
I feel represented by Bowen Yang in every which way in this skit
He killed it! So funny!
Pr-iceless.
This was both really stupid and insanely brilliant and I'm here for it!!!
I wanna wear that to The Met Gala.  😆
this is very funny/smart/fresh
yes iceburggg give us everythingg
Bowen.....😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
LOVER BOY IS FIREEE
Bowen is the best thing about SNL at the moment.
okay but hes got a point
Wait a minute somebody of Asian descent playing a large chunk of Atlantic ice. I'm sure there is someone on the cast more appropriate to play this role. I would have expected more from SNL.
Bowen killed it - this skit is peak SNL
This was so much funnier than I thought it would be.  Sometimes the silly stuff just works -- and Yang's indignant gay mode and that Easter bonnet and white suit of a costume really brought the laughs.  If David Rose from Schitt's Creek were an iceberg....
20 or 30 people or whatever... 😂😂
Laughing at how when Bowen's about to break he delivers his lines more aggressively  1:20 "yeah it's called mUSIC-CKH"
Wow, snl really sucks.
I LOVE Bowen and this was hilarious. I mean, the Titanic DID hour the iceberg, so. I need more of this character. Best skit of the night.
Instant Classic
Just found out what my next halloween costume will be😁
Brilliant.  Give these writers a freakin' raise.
This was great.
Um amazing
Thank you SNL for getting some Asian representation!
he must of raided lady gagas  closet
Bowen's a gem.
no exaggeration. this is THEEE best iceberg interview i have ever seen!
The thumbs down . . . ? Is 108 years too soon to joke about this? 🤣🤣🤣
The iceberg being a problematic person trying to get famous is literally a genius idea and bowen was perfect for it 😂
"I'm really proud of it.  It's 12 tracks  No skips  Swear to Gawd" His sassy confidence had mee dyyying the entire time 😣🤣🤣
it's da best! go bowen! go bowen!
To soon.
Bowen being Bowen. Yawn.
Flawless writing and concept. Well done y'all 😂👍💙🌊🎖✌
Home Run. lol. Where can i buy the album?
If I could give this two thumbs up, I would. Bowen Yang was hilarious
"It is Cold Music" ...
I heard the Antarctic is calling for Bowen Yang to be cancelled for wearing Ice Face on national TV 🌬❄🌬❄🌬
After all of recent political correctness this is one of the few things comedy shows can do
Sooooo funny!  Ive watched this like seven times already!!!
not even one joke about how he’s the symbol of the deep web. smh
Tbh I like a lot of bowen yangs other stuff I don't get the hype on this one
This was brilliant.  I want to see more of Bowen Yang!
Omg, he's wearing white titanic face in 2021? Cancelled!
white face, i'm offended. cancel the show... that's how it works right?
Dear Lorne,  More Bowen, please.  Thanks. Love,   Everyone
Hitting an iceberg is bad. Hitting an overly emotional iceberg is worse.
"Music" is truly one of my favorite albums.
Didn’t think an iceberg would be my new favorite SNL character!!!
Icebergs are cool!
This was soooooo funny🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🧊
i’m so thankful that bowen is getting bigger and bigger roles i love him
Lmfao
Lol funny bit!
lmao, i feel you icy giiirl
We want more Bowen!!!
I've really changed my thinking about those 4 or 5 people that drowned that night after watching this
See I would have thought the iceberg was sitting there minding it's own business, maybe doing some crosswords, and this enormous rude ship just crashes its way into your ass.
Can Bowen play anything but gay asian dude? Hes the same in basically every skit
I'm buying the album!!!
Iceberg... "they drowned BITCH.. BLAME WATER"!! LOL 😆🤣😂
Bowen is funny
Best part of last nights show.
The iceberg was just minding it's own business and the Titanic comes barreling through not being careful.
The vivacious puffin nationally record because consonant similarly invite unto a dramatic trail. secretive, medical billboard
Awesome
Another masterpiece from Bowen Yang 👏
Least funny cast member since pete Davidson. At least his update appearances were semi funny.
Meegan!
Iceberg has a valid point. Thanks Bowen ✔️
Kudos to the prop department who sculpted the iceberg to resemble the photo of the actual iceberg!
*Is that racist? He’s doing white face! Hey, white people! This is your chance to play the race card!*
This is really funny, but actually most of the people who died in the Titanic sinking died from hypothermia because the water was so cold. Very few victims pulled from the water were found to have died from drowning. Of course those who did sank,  so I guess you could say some drowned, but because many of them were wearing life vests it was the cold that got them.
There was room on the dam door!!!!!!
This was funny. A bitchy iceberg.
He murdered this!!! 🔥🔥🔥
Best sketch of the week hands down
I would love to see Bowen in more skits... he's naturally funny...
This and Dr Wedontknowdis
When is "Musik" koming out, I'll buy it.😺
This was hilarious. I didn't even realize that I needed to see this. My goodness this was perfect.
BEAUTIFUL!  THANK YOU! Nobody is blaming the human responsible for navigating the ship!
This was sooo hilarious!! Great writing!
2:30 this is the BEST line!
I'm a simple guy, I see Bowen, I click
Honestly when Collin said "What was going through your head?" I would have answered "A boat."
So we ok with white face lol
Bowen Yang is so good.  Maybe the best to come up on SNL in a couple years.
Bowen Yang has been a 🌟 since the first time he was on SNL. I can't believe that he's not a permanent cast member !?!
That iceberg made a lot of good...points
HILARIOUSLY silly ! Love Bowen Yang
That was funny.
clever sketch, well delivered
I'm really at a loss, there was nothing funny about this skit. Just dumb. A singing iceberg? Really?
This guy plays exactly one character.
Lol “they hit me, and i said sorry” lmao 😂
I absolutely loved this skit! It was hilarious! So creative and strangely relevant
🤣 oh man..funniest skit in the last 6 months.  Wa TER!
👍
It was the water all along 🤔
I thought I wouldn’t like this one, but so wrong.
This dude came out in an iceberg costume and made the entire audience laugh. The TALENT
comedy = tragedy + time. so true.
“Why are you attacking me?”
Bowen Yang is a national treasure.
Bit tasteless?
Bowen!! DIVA!!  💙
"It's twelve tracks, no skips, swear to God"
Right,  he was sitting there minding his own gotdamn business😡
Bowen Yang is such a great addition to SNL! they should feature him more.
This is SO funny!
Colin "Your album is called Music?" Bowen, "Yes it's called Music." Barely keeping from laughing.
This would have been 20x better if the audience laughing was cut.
The iceberg said... oh I'm sorry hahaha
How the fuck is Bowen not a permanent member already! I love him so MUCH! I laugh so freakin hard  cause he ALWAYS brings it every sketch.
Boat bumped into ME!  "excuse me". 😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣  Really funny skit!!!! 👍👍👍👍Bowen!
"OMG David" version with Levy may have been funnier.
I feel like this is going to be a bit that I tell my kids about some day
FUN FACT: The Titanic was sunk ON PURPOSE to kill all those who opposed the setup of the Federal Reserve bank. Research that shit.
I love the prolonged female laughter at “Which is insane???”
Bowen Yang makes everything he's in better than it could possibly be.
“Wine me, Dine me, I had an early lunch but I’m hungry for yooooouuuuuu lover boy” I can’t wait to  use this line on someone
This was a breakout performance. Holy crap, he nailed it.
The iceberg did nothing wrong
THEY HAVE GOT TO MAKE BOWEN A FULL CAST MEMBER!!!!
Wow, they made a whole segment without one reference to politics?  I didn't know they had it in them... something funny for once.
Bowen being as hilarious as ever.
This sucked
Micheal Che wit the shout out to DMX at the end
Hold the ocean accountable! #JusticeForTheIceberg
Who the hell lol
(*1940s TALENT AGENT VOICE*) This Kid's gonna be a Star, I Tell 'ya!
That’s a great song though. He can literally produce that album in reality ❤️🙏🏽👼💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
I stand with the iceberg 🧊
Huge Puppet History energy
I want this song! 😍
This segment sucks
Me: Ok. The ocean is now canceled.  Ocean: No‼️ You all are‼️  TSUNAMI‼️🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊🌊 😱😱😱😱 😵
im here for a Netflix special from this guy
I’m sorry but Bowen is not funny at all. All he does is act flamboyant. Okay we get it, you’re gay. Get over it
madonna also made an album called music...
And sour, humorless folk say SNL isn't funny. This was genius.
The Iceburg and Water are both INNOCENT!!! It was incompetence and greed that sunk the Titanic!!
Awesome beyond Awesome
His best skit ever.
This was brilliant!  I had NO idea that the iceberg was a fussy, gay, EDM artist with a publicist.
I just wanna know what the conversation was where Bowen learned he would have to try to cancel water while dressed as a singing iceberg.
The iceberg's song at the end was actually FIRE
Bowen Yang is the best addition to SNL in years.  He's also fantastic on Awkwafina's show.
This show has gone to shit again. Sad for comedy. I don't see why this guy keeps getting screen time. Not funny
It’s funny and all, but I think it would’ve been better if it was done in 2012, due to the 100th anniversary fo the sinking
Actor is not funny. His whole gay thing is tired, and never was funny, why is he on this show ?
Just perfect! 😂
Is the staff at snl safe? Im just curious cause no body in the right mind would wanna be apart of this
Not gonna lie, Lover Boy slaps. Wanted more.
The album is called "Music". Are they trolling Sia here??? lol
They should have someone dress up as the covid goo.And proceed to pelt with ugly food and curses.
Omg this was so funny 😂
This is a mockery to the titanic.
Fiiiire
I had an early lunch but I’m hungry for you 😂
Snl keeps deleting my comment because I do not praise Bowen ..shame on you
Kinda gay...
The Irish Cacophony part did me in.Hilarious!
SNL kill me every weekend ,its too much 🤣😆💯
This was truly hilarious. I love Bowen Yang.
This was the Best Snatch game evah!
A Gay Iceberg. DON'T clue me into what this skit is all about.
“Whitestar Built a bad ship” Best Line
Rainbow snow cone
I'm sorry, but he has no range. The only good thing he's done was the Fran Lebowitz impression. So many other cast mates play characters where you can barely tell it's them. He's always just doing the same character but in a different outfit.
The amount of heavy laughter wasn't really justified. I think people just laugh at socially enabled behavior because they need to feel they did their part.
This.was.HILARIOUS!
Omg!!! 🤣🤣🤣😍
Who knew icebergs had an alternative lifestyle? 😂😜😂😜😂
After this sketch....I am on the side of the iceberg.
C'mon SNL, you can do better. This was dumb AF.
Ive tried to give this guy a chance. He is just not funny. Its like they brought him on the show JUST because hes gay. He is NOT FUNNY. i wish he was. He never makes me laugh at all. The iceburg? Really?
OMG that's me, Classic
Skits like this make me not care about the attacks
Has to be the least funny actor I've ever seen on SNL
This satire is the reason why we can't have nice things. “Why are you attacking me?!”  Is now the the call of the woke!  Yes, I get all the puns and stuff. But, I really would have like to have seen the Gay Passover Bunny.
"You built a bad boat."
is that yoko ono...?!? :-) ;-)
This segment doesn’t slow down. Every line is amazing
Skits like this make me hate snl
What an amazing skit!!!!! Sooooo good. I cracked up the entire time.
Bowen is so iconic. Best non-cast-member in a long time.
Absolutely amazing. 10/10
I saw Bowen, I clicked!
They’re definitely going to keep Bowen as a cast member
I guess they couldn’t think of anything funny so they did this.
Bowen makes me laugh harder than almost any of the other cast members, he is always so consistently funny.
Hahaha look at that.... white face....
“Why are you such a bitch, Colin?” — Iceberg from Titanic, 2021
I want to hear the rest of the song.
Pretty sure the Iceberg meant to sink the Queen Mary.
Passive aggressive, narcissistic, SOB iceberg...
He clearly channeled his inner David Rose
Bowen Yang is criminally underrated
I'm sorry but this is not something to make light of. This was a tragedy. Very poor taste.
This sketch is awesome!  Bowen did a great job here - SNL needs to promote him from a featured player to a main cast member next season!
Strong Lohan on Letterman vibes.
Ummm icebergs single is a whole ass bop tho!!!
I lost it when he didn't want to talk about the sinking but wanted to promote his "album"😂🤣
A hundred years and the iceberg plays the victim, but nice suit
“Before I turn around and go, like, ‘what?’ half my ass is gone.”
This is a riot.  I love all the segments of Weekend Update.  They always bat a 1000. Love you guys.
Only Bowen has enough talent to make me feel sympathy for an iceberg
Wow, so NOT funny.
Bowen Yang  Will have a great future. He is a national treasure!
Is it too early to declare Bowen Yang a national treasure?
HILARIOUS!
clearly referencing lindsey lohan’s notorious interview with david letterman here
He did so well
God that was stupid ,  snl is not funny anymore,  so sad
The iceberg is auditioning to get into Eurovision with his new album As a European, I know he would win and I'd also vote for him
Great bit. More of Bowen Yang, please!
This guy is sinking the show also
Too soon.
Umm the titanic sinked in 1912 not 1911
this could have fallen flat on its face (odd premise) but he pulled it off flawlessly.
"That's not me, that's WAATER!"
Is not like he went and hit the Titanic the Titanic hit him.
Excellent make-up! So funny 😂!
“ Everyone is talking about me not about the WATERR!”
12 tracks, no skips, swear to god.
Genius.
stream lover boy right now
Yang has been a great addition to the SNL cast.  The best part is how he keeps greatly underestimating the lives lost.  And I'm glad he had a good audience that night who could laugh a dark humor.  Sometimes it goes the other way.
I remember when SNL was actually funny . They can't even make me smile and I'm stoned .
"You said you would be my Oprah!!"
Well you gotta give it him because he is right why should he take all the blame.
I can only hope one of the 12 tracks is a cover of "Ice, Ice, Baby"
Give Bowen a raise, fire Pete.
Bowen Yang is going to be a superstar of SNL in the future, up there with Ferrell, Fey, Wiig, Samberg...
😂 Wa-TERR.
Noel Fielding deserves some credit for the derivation of his whole thing.
It's so nice to see satire that is not all about 45** and its minions...back to some kind of normalcy...love it!
Irish Cacophony new band name!!!!!
This guy is talented
It’s the same character every sketch🥴🙃
A gay iceberg...
SNL is soooo good at songs lately!
My goodness 😂😂😂,👍.
Ok gotta admit........that was pretty good.
Global warming: revenge of the humans
This is amazing.
Hilarious 🤣
What did Che say at the end…how did he signoff??  Was that DMX's real name😮
we love bowen yang!!!
Lolol this is the funniest thing Bowen has done on the show.
Too soon?
The way Bowen recites "I'm here to pr-mote my AL-bumm."is genius only he can pull off. Always Hilarious. 😂
HAAAAAAAAAA Haaaaaaaaaaa Haaaaaa
I heard “MUSIC” is actually pretty good. Back in the 90’s, there was even an entire cable TV channel dedicated to just ...IT. 👍🏽‼️
Great video, I only have two words for you Mr. Colin Jost. "Tsk! Tsk!" How dare you attack another cold white iceberg. At least this one isn't a racist. It just has loose lips which sink ships and frigid waters all around. 🧊+🚢
Love Bowen Yang
“They drowned, bitch! That’s not me! That’s water! Nobody’s cancelling the ocean!” I can’t stop laughing
As soon as I read the title I thought, “Bowen Yang”. Thumbnail confirmed.
HALF my ass is GONE!
SNL was waiting for so long to do this one ... Had a "too soon" count down clock 🤦
I literally choked while watching this. I couldn’t stop laughing
4:19 “I’m Earl Simmons [DMX], goodnight!”
Is this by Patti Harrison? Someone tell the truth
3:15 bruh I love but isn't ice made of water
Irish cacophony...
This was soooo good he is my new favorite SNL cast member
Bowen just keeps getting better and better.
so freaking talented，coolest gay lord among us Asian people. Never let me down. And I also want more kyle sketches
"Before I turn around.... HALF MY ASS IS GONE." 😂
This was so so good&
as a publicist....I just want yall to know...these news people dont give a fuck what we say and there really isnt anytyhing we can do about it, godspeed
Too soon
So much talent
This was genius!!!!
*Really* bad iceberg puns and over-the-top faux sensitivity. WHY is anyone laughing?!?!?!
That iceberg looked like something Lady Gaga would wear to the Grammys
That was actually pretty good.  They should give him some more skits.
How G is he
🤣
He was born for this role 😂
This is one of the funniest WU guests ever!
😂 I'd love to have been there when this was pitched as a sketch!  And props to props for the head dress!
I looove this actor!!
The song has a very Might Boosh feel
this one was really funny 😊
SNL mascot is the Titanic.
...Too soon!!😁🤣
😳 That awkward moment when you low-key feel like the iceberg has a valid point. 🤣
I don't know how much they're paying Bowen Yang, but it's not nearly enough.
I'd rather have had Shane Gillis than this guy.. sheeshhhhhh
What real life drama/controversy are they using the sinking of the Titanic to parody, because, I gotta say, the iceberg has a good argument.
Bowen 🧊
Ok, I didn’t think this would be funny but 😂 it’s so funny!
Snl has hit the iceberg and is going down like the titanic
I think this might be fake. The real iceberg totally melted by now.
he needs more air time lol
This shit is fucking dumb. A gay iceberg? Smh
Bowen Yang is a national treasure
LORNE MICHAELS,, what happened to your integrity?? We all have to suffer so you can appease the gay community? How about a FUNNY gay? This dude is not just NOT FUNNY!
"Everyone's talking about me, no one's talking about THE WATERR! What did the autopsy say the iceberg did? No, they DROWNED B*tch!"
Yeah Iceberg, I don’t think in this scenario you’re the victim.  If we were talking about global warming, then that’s a different story.😞
I get that he got the gig because Gay and Asian checks off the diversity boxes. Just wish funny was one of them.
Cancelled!!!
This was a great skit
What about people who died that night??? Wtf
This was way funnier than it had any right to be 😂😂😂 Bravo 👏
Iceberg giving major James Charles vibes haha
What another stupid sketch.
Is it unhealthy that I just watched this 6x in a row? And it gets funnier every time! Easily becomes one of SNL’s greatest moments! Well done Bowen. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Bowen is my favorite!
😹🙌🏾 The full river dance and my ass was gone got me! lmbao
"What was going through your head that night?" is in my top 5 Weekend Update lines.
More Jost and Yang!
Bowen be killin shit, he's dope.
Hilarious!
OMG. This is so funny.
Just cause it happened over 100 years ago doesn't mean it's funny at all. What're they gonna play the plane that crashed into the twin towers next? It's sick and not funny
Ive always felt this way lowkey
I didn't expect this one to be funny. I was wrong.
More Bowen please....This guy  kills it every time..Wth Snl?
I think they give so much limelight to the iceberg just because it is white.
"And nobody's talking about THE WATER"
Tragedy + Time = Comedy
They bump into me and I said “I’m sorry” Which is insane
If this was intended as postmodernist/neoliberal satire, it's brilliant and funny.  If not, it's still funny.
Yah, I was ready to give it a chilly reception, but then the iceburgh was so cool I froze in my tracks and my resistance melted!
This was actually a funny skit, and should get the credit it deserves!!!  "There was so much going on under the surface." LOL
well we are melting his family away so yeah
Maybe the right will quit attacking old Asian Americans and laugh at this great skit instead and realize IT NOT THEM ITS YOU!!!
We don't deserve Bowen Yang.
Bowen Yang as the Iceberg? Didn’t expect that, but that truly was one of the coolest, that he’s ever done.
Love how he passed the blame to the water. Bowen Yang deserves main cast status.
OK Here is an idea. a 2 hour special on NBC called ASIAN FANTASTIC hosted by Bowen Yang featuring Asian Talent and history. AND HOST THE OSCARS?! Bowen Yang And Whoopi Goldberg host THE OSCARS! EVERYONE GET ON IT NOW!
This is “it” OMG super funny sketch
🙂
Bowen is going to be a massive star.
why is the iceberg so damn gay
Bowen Yang is such a gem of this cast
Only Yang would put this together
I LOVE HM! I LOVE HM! I LOOOOOVE HM! HE IS EVERYTHING! ALL OF IT! MARRY ME NOW! PLEASE! :P he literally  takes my breath away! I mean listen to the crowd! I NEED A MOVIE NOW! NOW! GET ALL THE AGENTS ON IT!
Some say this only 10% of the whole story
I couldn't help but to think he was channeling is inner Schitt's Creek for some reason. Hilarious segment.
For the premise this could be a very stupid sketch. Instead it's so well done. Great talents and authors on SNL.
Is the audience children?
I love the LGBTQ touch....LOL
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm Earl Simmons goodnight! ✊🏾
Bowen's finest moment thus far on the show.
Definitely the highlight of the week.
Such a good cast all around, but Bowen Yang is my favorite!
Yang Delivered another masterpiece 🥰✨✨✨
This is comedy gold
The very idea is genius.
This is so zanny. I can't believe it. LOL. Fun stuff.
Hyperpop yaasss
This actor is brilliant
My birthday April 14th .... 🗽
0:30 👏😂 I am an iceberg lol 1:28
00:21 "What was going through your head that fateful night?"  The _Titanic._ It was the Titanic that went through it. Yeesh.
This is a effing gem! 🤣🤣🙌🙌🙌
Getting Boy George vibes lol
"I'm Earl Simmons, goodnight!" Michael Che with the DMX tribute <3
bowen is carrying this whole season on his back, i love him so much
Hilarious! I loved it.
Thank god for shows like tosh.o these days.
We want to see more of Bowen yang ! He is super!
I like SNL but this guy is really annoying.
Racist for being white face
Please fire Bowen Yang. Most irritating cast member EVER.
As someone with poor blood circulation, I find the blue face so offensive! 🥶Cancelled!!
Snl keeps getting gayer
I love the song “My Ice Will Go On” from the movie.😊
What old cold iceberg
Changing the questions, that’s cold man.
Why do I get a feeling there is going to be a movie made from this perspective? I'd pay to see that.
This Sharon Osborne style self victimization is amazing
Wishing you all lots of love and happiness for the future
The writers should seize every opportunity to indulge Bowen Yang’s drag Queens!
"And then I hear this Irish cacophony behind me.." 😆🤣 This whole sketch 🔥
Bowen always makes these characters hilariously quirky.
Someone’s gonna find this offensive
If Hal Willner were alive, we'd probably really get a hyperpop track at the end of this sketch :<
Blame it on the water!
one of the funniest skits lately, good one!  totally going to be a classic..
So, that's a gay iceberg, right?  Sorry, an iceberg that happens to be gay.
This was so funny to me. Good job 🙂.
This is going to be #3 on a "Best of Bowen Yang" listacle in 2027.
bowen yang is so funny
*”Hey. White Star Line. You built a bad boat! It didn’t work out. That’s on you, honey!”* 😂
This is why the GOP is promoting global warming.
I really like Bowen Yang! He cracks me up.
Love this because it was done so cool 😎 🧊❄
4:17 Did Michael Che say "I'm Earl Simmons!"? Edit: It's DMX's real name.
Che with the DMX shoutout! RIP
What I find weirdly interesting is that nothing the iceberg said is technically untrue.
it's true though... i'm not sure why people would be angry at an iceberg when the ship drove into it. Not like the iceberg was sentient and running into the boat. The iceberg would actually be the victim but the SNL skit makes the iceberg the villain?
I love this, I love these weird ass out of left field ideas Yang has
Props/costume department hit it out of the park with this one.
Great Skit but he's gonna get so cancelled for wearing Iceface! :D
"Everyone's talking about meee... IT WAS THE WATERR, THEY DROWNED BITCH!"
i wish weekend update was the entire show
Funny
So is this a reef of good people being framed as bad or bad people pretending to be good. Like was the Oprah reference a nod to Megan’s interview or am I reading into heavily
He’s not funny. We all know why he’s on the show
Skit sucked 🤮
Iceberg haute couture. "Omg..their gonna make a movie about this." Cool hat😉✌
Hot take: I never found being extra being the joke good. Getting past some of the deliveries the lines were good
Too soon...
This show is absolutely terrible.
Best bit ever on update.. hands down
113 downvotes... too soon?
Not good in this times fore me...sorry
This is a bad character wtf Bowen. What kinda PMC bullshit is this?
What a bop
snl has really picked it up this week, this sketch is incredibly funny. bowen smashes it out the park.
bowen is simply the best
I LOVED THIS!!!
AHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAGAHAGGAGAGAGGAGAGAGAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
This is basically a solid entry for the Eurovision Songfestival.
Iceberg is so 100%! OMG! The water drowned the people! Ok. Let's boycott the ocean. 😂
Too soon, SNL!
This is my favorite Bowen Yang sketch to date. I think he was brilliant.
This was pretty funny. Ha
Sorry bit sick for the 1500 lost souls who went through hell.
"40 or 50 people died or whatever" 🤣
Crazy. How was all the rest of this season so bad (wasting some really great hosts), and yet this episode is surprisingly good?
When you think these clips just can’t get any dumber
I've never liked Bowen, but this was really funny and very clever.
yoooo, too soon
I better see SEVRAL gays dressed as this this Halloween!! 😂
This broke me...... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love that Bowen is giving Kate a run for the money, i know it's not a competition but man that was sound!
Can we have Bowen Yang as a musical guest? I'd like to listen to the whole song.
Is it just me or was this a metaphor of the Chauvin trial? 🤔 fantastic sketch 👏
I don’t find this guy funny.  🤷‍♂️ 🥺
I want to hear this album.
This was a really clever sketch and performed perfectly. Damn.
Actually, they froze to death. Seems like a joint effort between the ocean and the ice berg.
All good but the cringe song
Didn't find it funny about the disaster killing 1500 people.
Yep, it was 100% the fault of White Star that 1500 people died
His outfit is so awesome 😆, I'm distracted by all the sparkles ☺
TOO SOON!!!
Bowen was awesome!  He was perfect!
Lol he was just there "chillin" minding his business and along came a boat or whatever.
Bowen is a rising star. He’s gonna be huge in comedy
This has to be in my top 10 best weekend update BIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i thought colin said “sank you for being here”
ok but can we talk about the craftsmanship of that headpiece? it belongs in an art museum.
His ice face is offensive.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yang is channeling his inner Heidi in this one 😂
Brilliant - just kept getting increasingly bonkers. Nice one!
Most of then didnt drown.They died from hypothermia. Come on writers
Lol!!! This is brilliant!!!
Not quite sure here, but is this whiteface?   😲💀
This is so creative i love this 😂
This is the gloriously weird SNL we have been missing for years. Thanks
Sadly, the ice is only starting our ending as its melting hastens our near-term human extinction. First it came for Titanic and I did not speak out because I was not a passenger. Then it came for the planet and we were all passengers, drowning in a sea of stars and nothingness.
Instant classic.
The best snl host!!
This guy the iceberg made me laugh snl hadn’t made me laugh in Forever lol the iceberg guy was awsome lol
Why are you attacking me 🤣🤣
I can only think he was backstage getting into costume and said “You KNOW we gotta put 2 sparkles over both my nipples!”
the way the number of casualties dropped from “40 or 50” to “20 or 30” 💀💀💀
Yeah why no one blame the ocean? That is funny!
Bowen's delivery is just perfect here. So good. He's one of the first cast members since Andy Samberg to try such weird stuff on Update.
at 1:21 did Bowen say "its called music -" or "its cold music"
Hey this was... actually a little funny. I chuckled... is this a miracle???
This is an instant classic 👏
"It was like full on Riverdance" and I'm choking from laughing.. 😂😂😂
I knew his father. He's a chip off the old block
This is so good. Best thing i've seen from SNL for some time now.
Why did no one in the writing room say, “Hey everyone, this isn’t just dumb, it’s also horribly unfunny. Does anyone else have a skit idea? Anyone? Anything at all?” 🙄
Reason of the Asian hate ???
haha he needs to come back more often
Half my ass was gone.. and that was my best feature 🤣🤣🤣
say HIS NAME, Colin
Some woman has a really weird laugh...
Best character EVER!!!!! Best sketch in a long time :)
This is fantastic.
Wow the lines of this sketch got me rolling.......  They drowned B*TCH  Autopsy Report lol
Comedy gold!
Bowen is incredible in this sketch
The funniest Weekend Update
icebergs are gay
Grasping at straws, kind of offensive, good thing the sinking happened over a hundred years ago, nobody to complain. Lets make a joke about Kobe Bryants helicopter crash who we gonna blame the helicopter. No because joking about Kobe's death would be in poor taste. Go ahead and joke about and see who laughs.
That was the best bit I've seen in a while and you guys have been killing it. So that's saying something.
Bowen yang has been on snl for a year and is already an icon
how do we get bowen involved with eurovision
Well done
0:42 I'd say "Get a better Navigator!    They hit ME!"
the iceberg is kinda right. stupid boat did HIT HIM.  the boat was ACTUALLY POORLY designed so it sank pretty quickly. AND the ocean DID drown many of the passengers that did die.   would you blame the street light that a drunk driver ran his car into?
This is brilliant 😂😂
Too soon man..
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He played it really cool
ugh.. you guys already did the whiney annoying character in another sketch tonight
Channeling serious Schitt’s Creek Alexa vibes
Lets make fun of a famous trip where lots of people died.  Well 20 or 30...  This is why Republicans want to "de-fund the arts"...
They DROWNED bitch, that’s not me that’s WATER
That was very good.
"before i turn around and am like 'what?' ... half my ass is gone!!"  .... that one got me lmao.
Next up : The plane that downed the twin towers
Bowen killin it again!!! Want to see more of him!
The imitation of the fucking Irish music I AM CRYING
That was hilarious 😂
SNL is so good at putting the people with the most obnoxious laughs next to the audience mics
Nope. Too soon. 😅
bowen yang NEEDS to be in more sketches
"12 tracks, no skips I swear to god" 💀
Lol
So.... Ya’ll been watching Historic Travels during the pandemic too ay??? Sam the man with his solid take on maritime mayhem!!
Bowen just ain't funny to me.
Por favor que sea un invitado recurrente 😍😍😍🤣🤣🤣🤣
bowen is not funny he’s so one dimensional. it’s cool that they have a gay and asian cats member but in every sketch he’s the same character just in a different costume
He plays the exact same gay Asian character in every single skit. Not a diverse actor and will end up typecast.
This dude is always Hilarious 😂
Cancel this parody bit player
the queenie Iceberg that is...Looool! 😹
I can’t decide if that was funny or brilliant. Wow. But I’m afraid the album isn’t going to make it.
He's not funny, sorry.
There was only one correct answer to “tell me what was going through your head that night”.
Even after 109 years, that Ice burg SLAY in that outfit!! 💯💯💯💯😎😎😎😎
The joke @ 2:30 is VERY DEEP...No pun intended, but hey....People of Color and Women will get why he says, "and that's insane", but it's what we've done for so long.
💙💙 in blue face 😂😂
obsessed
Just the costume has me 💀
Simultaneously cringe yet also great!
It gonna funnier as it went on. 😂
Omg, I love Bowen.
Stupid!
😂🤣 bwhahahahaha
Sponsored by Big Iceburg
Atleast we finally got both sides of the story I wonder if they will make a movie about him 🤣😂🥺😂
Sooo, when is the album coming to Spotify? The Iceberg is my favorite musician.
Ugh🤢 can we please stop trying to make bowen yang happen🙄
It's so wild how this tragedy over 110 years ago is something we can laugh about now, and how people in the future might look at our tragedies the same way
Technically due to global warming this iceberg is also dead. 🤷🏾‍♀️
Bowen is sooooo talented.He really nails  his sketches and personas!!!! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
"No one is cancelling the ocean."  That's for sure.
hate this gay guy
Is this supposed to be funny?
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂
This is so refreshing frankly
The water that's me drowned bitch but no one cancelled the water or rivets it's always about the rivets
Hands down one of the funniest sketches on SNL
Please release that album
Lol😭😭😭
Bowen Yang is the shit!
Bowen Yang, you are a gift
At least Colin smiled... That was the only good thing about this..
Love the makeup
First of all! This is Kristen Wiig level Zany funny AF! Well played sir.
These are the  jokes we get now. It was so easy during the Trump era.
Is it just me, or is this just not funny?🤨 I saw it trending on Twitter and rushed over to watch, but...meh.😑
Save to Favorites
They've officially jumped the shark
Bowen Yang is a super talent! ❤️ him!
They bumped o to to me, and I said “Oh, I’m sorry.” Which is insane. 🤣
This was hilarious
ICEBERG: The Titanic came to me. I didn't come to it. I lost half my ass.
Too soon?
Bowen Yang keeps being iconic ever single week. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Actually, they didn't drown. They froze.
Someone actually came up with this idea and I love it
Asian in White Face is Okay and Funny.  Trying to keep up with all the woke rules.
As expected, his every character is gay, even an iceberg. So talented and versatile actor! Even Leslie Jones was more diverse with her characters.
I can't stop laughing.
I got a chuckle out of this
I'm buying that EDM CD....and playing it backwards to find hidden Titanic messages.AWWWWWW Too soon?!
made me think "this is as good as SNL used to be."  Great concept, writing and execution.  Totally enjoyable.
Can't believe they never made a "Just the tip" joke
Please take him off the SNL as soon as possible he hasn't been on one funny skit since he started, or better yet any skit hes been on he has never been funny
The audience is annoying tonight 🤦🏿‍♀️😂😂
🤣🤣🤣 He looks like Liberace. An iceberg with an album.
What has become of comedy. May god have mercy on our souls
“I turned around and...HALF MY ASS IS GONE.” I audibly cackled.
You guys, LEAVE MY ICEBERG ALONE!!!! 😩 LEAVE HER ALONE!!!! She was just CHILLIN!!!! 😭😭😭 LEAVE....!!! ICEBERG....!!! ALONE...!!!! Or you’re gonna have deal with me!!! 😫😭😢
This is so good!
"Hey White Star Line You Built a Bad Boat"!😆😅😂🤣
Clicked on this video because of the thumbnail. Wasn't disappointed
I am stunned/amazed that NO ONE made the connection to Paris Hilton and David Letterman..I thought "you said you'd be my Oprah" was too obviously on the nose..icebergs can't talk..generally a set up for a metaphor..smh well here we are
This was HILARIOUS  - and my great great grandmother survived the sinking of the Titanic
God Bowen is the next Kate Mckinnon and Cecily Strong. He’s such a force of gay absurdity. I love it.
I'm really sad it ended 😭
Love it
This is the kind of SNL character I'd wear a t-shirt of.
Notes App apology from the iceberg
The Iceberg is spitting straight facts. Well, not straight facts, but facts 💯
He cracks me up. Bowen is so under used.
Che with the DMX shout out! Yes!
great wig
Ki ki
Best of the night!
“No! They drowned bitch!” Priceless Bowen!
Nice shoutout to DMX at the end there.
BEST of the night
It's  so Cringe. So difficult  to watch. Colin working overtime to make this work. Pushing the fake laughs 😅
Asian Elton John, is it?
I really want to know who wrote this sketch
Another failed sketch who's character was used to draw out weekend update.
This is amazing
Smile George Floyd is still dead
Don't forget the hunter Biden laptop sketch Lorne Michaels.
SNL SUCKS - What a lame skit
Is this some strange reference to jillian wuestenberg?
Nice to see SNL keeping up to date with current affairs.
Hilarious!!!!
White face!
man, this could've been a good sketch if it was played by someone likeable and funny.
Effin' brilliant and hilarious. Bravo.
He nailed it
Best character ever! Hysterical!!!
What were the writers smoking when they thought up this sketch???
#eurovision
Oh...HE IS THE ICEBERG .....LOLOLOL
On a scale of 1-10 how high was the writer who wrote this?
I like this
Bowen Yang you are amazing 👏 🤣😂🤣😂  thank you so much 💓
He killed this skit 😂😂
Now I know what I want to be for Halloween!
Friggen hiiiiiilarious! I can’t get enough! 🧊
He's good.
Has cancel culture gone too far?
Yang is so underated 😂
Omg.....what a totally original idea and hilarious!
"You said you'd be my Oprah,"  Snorted!! So funny!
THE BEEEESSSTT!!!
Too soon
Just saw this on tv!
Bowen really sold this one. Hilarious! 😆
This is stupid. Id rather watch the Jack & Rose fictional crap. Its just ridiculous how a real even has become so ingrained into pop culture, that we are numb to the fact these were REAL people. Not actors. What if we did this with 9/11. Make up two people that never existed, each person works in different building. After the planes hit, they fight to reach each other. But has the towers fall, one of them gets trapped and the other fights to dig them out. And just as they reach them, they die. It great to honor and remember a tragedy, never forget what took place. But you dont make fun of the dead. That is one thing Titanic Truths LLC has always been against, and why we have dedicated our company to preserving the TRUE history of the Titanic. Hence the reason for "Truths" in our name.
it's like 2 am and im clenching my jaw trying not to laugh so loud. this is my new favorite sketch right before diner lobster.
Bowen Yang is such a treat!
I hope they use this character again
Bowen must be so deep😂
That Irish cacophony sounds a lot like “la cucaracha” sped up
"THEY DROWNED, BITCH!" Bowen <3
This is great
The iceberg skit was genius! And the costume was spot-on. Lolol
A1
A funny SNL skit + Bowen's talent = AT LAST!!!
Bowen Yang deserves to be one of the greats. PLEASE
“ɪᴛ ᴡᴀs ғɪғᴛᴇᴇɴ ʜᴜɴᴅʀᴇᴅ ᴘᴇᴏᴘʟᴇ...” “WHY ARE YOU ATTACKING ME”
This was definitely funniest sketch I’ve ever seen on SNL
Am I the only 1 that thinks that the iceberg is acting like a gay blm woke liberal blaming everyone else for this actions n not taking responsibility..........even the iceberg is now a leftist piece of shit
this was awesomeeeeee ahahahahahahha
Yawn.
“I’m Earl Simmons, Goodnight” Ay yo Dog, that’s my man! Thank you, Mr. Che 🙏 #RIPDMX #AllDogsGoToHeaven
BOWEN IS THE BEST!❤❤❤❤❤ He is a gift that keeps on giving!!!!😂😂😂❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥
He is perfect for the show. He is going to be the next standout star.
❤️🤣
Turn down the canned laughter. We are wearing headphones!
So accurate of today’s liberals! 😂😂😂 if you’re offended by this it totally proves my point 💯
"They DROWNED, bitch"
wow y’all really let ya boy do white face? twitter’s gonna have this dude canceled by the morning
AMAZING!!!!!!!! Great job Bowen!!!!
Did...they just make me side with the damn iceberg?
Ridiculous and funny. The mind of Bowen Yang. 👍
That second mUsiC killed me
"I'm Earl Simmons, good night!" 😥
Weekend Update..best part of the show..AGAIN.. C'mon Jost & Che..stop being so writing stingy with your work.. 😂
#theoceanisoverparty
Bowen killed this just hilarious and clever.
Is that Lady Gaga?
I’ll be honest, I kinda side with the iceberg.  Berg was the victim.
Bizarrely awesome!
Bowen Yang as the Iceberg just slayed. 🔥
I don’t want to take sides, but he does have a point about the water.
"Blame waterrrr! Because the 20 or 30 people drowned!" 😂😂
that iceberg dude has never been funny
Bowen is seriously good
comedy
This is the perfect bit for him.
Iceberg is the queen I always needed💝
#BlameTheWater
"So Colin, what kind of jokes are we going to do now that Trump's gone?"  "Uh..."
This is an amazing combination of incredible writing, awesome costuming and excellent acting. Also, I never knew the iceberg was gay! (Not that there’s anything wrong with that)
Genius.
This guy's got something.
The iceberg is giving me Stefon Vibes
i thought this was a Gotye video
Stefon...
This shit was hilarious!!!
Skit of the year!
Topical stuff, not like you could be mockingly comparing the reaction of the media to Biden putting kids in cages vs Trump, or Biden bombing Syria, or Biden giving away billions to corporate interests 🤷🏼‍♂️
Why is nobody upset an Asian cast member did "white-face"? But If somebody does "black-face" it's racist.
hahahahahaaaaaha he is right tho
CANcEling ThE OCeAn!
"they ran into me and i said I'm sorry that's crazy"
I am a strong believer in hearing the both sides of the story and now, I dont know what to think too be honest with you all
Respect to Michael for his DMX reference. 🙏🏾 RIP
that is, oddly somehow, a good look for him
I saw this and thought it had no chance of working but it was hilarious, excellent, one of the best snl sketches yet
Happy to see the Iceburgs heart will go on.
This guy is funny as a crutch.  He's ruined the show.
I love this sketch. A lot. 😂🤣
They drown not my problem lmao
Bowan killed it in this skit!
This was ONE of the only funny things on SNL tonight.
Uh oh white face Asian,  I wonder if anyone cares about that. I guess it's bad when white people do it not any one else. Snl sucks now.
omg “Lover Boy” sounds like an actual song by Oh Land👏👏👏
“You said you would be my Oprah, Colin!” 😂
"Half of my ass is gone."  My 2021 so far.
Nothing funny here
"half my ass is gone!!" that fuckin' killed me
Oh Bowen, I love you so much. Bottle Boy is still my fave but this is up there too!
Hysterical!! ❤️❤️❤️
Bowen's best character yet!
Cool sketch..
'I'm Earl Simmons, goodnite!' RIP DMX
Fabulous.
bowen has great delivery and everything else. rock on!
clever!!!! hahahaha 😂😂😂😂
I want to hear music
omg. this is amazing.
Looks like cake with whipped cream
this is adorable
Hella funny!
“What did the autopsy say? They icebergded? Nooo. They drowned bitch! That’s not me, that’s water.”
"Your album's called Music?! 🤨🤨"
He’s kind of one note but this was good
Bowen is gonna end up being one of the all time snl greats, his charisma and comedic talent is impeccable
Gold!!!
🤗🤣😳Yaaaaa ...SOOooo Bring the Talking iceberg Back FOR REDEMPTION (💯💞#Asians✌) Because IT WAS A DECLASSIFIED (within the past 2 to 4 years) to BE A MULTI MILLION DOLLAR MACHINE (SUBMARINE, That damn Yellow SUBMARINE😳). #ReSearChingHELPS
“It was midnight - I was chilling” Just realized the pun lol
This part will go on.
i though it was boy george at first
If Gen Z was an iceberg 😂🧊
Saturday night live greatness
tooo soooon
"but nobody's canceling the ocean" BEST LINE
It's just complete genius at work when you create great comedic energy from a literal iceberg sketch!
They bumped into you and you couldn’t move. Not your fault. He should have been in Crazy Rich Asians.
It's so funny ...😂😂👏
“My publ-ICE-ist was very clear...”
I would cancel the ocean but then the fish would attack me.
Glad to see the Iceberg's heart will go on.
GOLD! Absolute Gold! Bowen Yang delivered comedy perfection! 😍
Can he get a guest actor emmy for this?
ok but to be fair the water does have to held for a lot more responsibility

OMG I love this SO much.  Bowen Yang needs to be a regular!  VOTE FOR BOWEN HERE!  ☑☑☑
Did they pay people to over-laugh this week or is there a drunken bridal shower in the audience?
The only snl sketch that’s made me audibly laugh in years
The iceberg is making some good points...
"I'm Earl Simmons. Good night!"
Asian Daniel Levy
Bowen is KILLING IT these days! Next big thing. I love him so much
Jost to Iceberg: "What was going through your head that fateful night?"   Me: "Um, the Titanic?"
Bowen and the writers of this sketch deserve promotions
"What was going through your head?" The ship... duh
I can only trust the icebergs side of the story the titanic is a rasist bitch
0:21 ... A SHIP
I never once looked at it from the Iceberg's perspective. Thanks Bowen.

Should have known the iceberg was gay. It took a pounding and kept on going ❤
still looking good after all these years. somethings just never defrost with age.
What an amazing costume design
“First of all, you came to where I live and you hit me?”  BTW, that song part is Eurovision gold!
Poor Icy. He just wants to promote his EDM: Eventual Drowning Music!
Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between “Separate Self” & Cosmos 🎈
