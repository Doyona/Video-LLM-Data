thanks for 2m :)
I use a pelican as a water bottle to spread the good word of your channel.
Man you change the colour of that robe to white and you’ve got a whole new world 😂
i love how you always expect the professor is surely dead already
I can't believe you don't get sued by Nike to hell for the just do it.
This was, unironically, the BEST Gamer Sups advert I have ever seen.
5:23 LMAOOOOO
4:21
The wizard M word 😂
“Sebastian Swallows”  I’m dead 💀
I use avada kadavra on every troll i see
Did you know that the deffence against the dark arts professor is around the age of headmaster Black but she looks older because of the minestry of magic
I mean, I love going rogue on games but the fact that I couldn’t just attack randoms and cause chaos meant I actually got some missions done 😆 I wonder what the wanted levels would actually be if they existed though…
lol
I hope harry potter characters make their way to this awesome game.
I hate that there is censorship over my character name in a single player game. So lame.
I must say Professor Garlick is fine as hell
His character is black but he’s white…  Dunkey? Is that you?
Except the Wizarding World actually has its n-word, “M*dblood.”
Did you have to pay your sister to be in that ad? 😂😂😂
0:28 “well played, J. K. Rowling, you woman!” 😂
The deep wilderness pking comment got me lmao
So is this game good?
The emotional maturity of JKR😂😂😂
"Repairo... which sounds like Australian slang..." omg lmao, I've been trying not to think about that for the last 100hours I've been playing the game.
6:07 jake paul
Bro this is hilarious 😂
As a german speaking, the France joke in the beginning of this "verführerischen" Video made me first laugh since the "Finanzamt" knocked. But enough joy, I will go back to work now!
You make the only commercials I will sit through. Well done.
Bro you're so scared that you like this game and you're making a video about it but yet you keep insulting the creator I thought you was a ruthless YouTuber You just like the rest of them scared the fact that you like a game when what the creator said was correct there is only a male and a female and I think you know that too scared boy
Good video but honestly you didn't need the JK Rowling hating on marginalized groups line because you're wrong and you're spreading misinformation to people who watch your videos. People saying that she is spreading "hate" are just idiots who can't comprehend two simple sentences.
A WW2 joke in the first minute is always a good hook for the videos
papasmokez as a peaky blinder looks like phil foden
I always thought you'd look 3% cooler with a baby wand
Hogwarts indeed is a child soldier making University 😂
Painful to watch tbh
Is this game made by rockstar games?
Oh the thin humour in great. I can't stop laughing. Great job!
I have played this same game on my Pc in like 2014. This looks like a remastered version of the same game.
6:05 haha
I think the wizarding world's n-word is the n-word
3:45  Perhaps you should inform yourself about what JK Rowling really said before making ridiculous statements. 6:24  Ok, exactly how stupid are you?
I named my character Paul Plops
2:16  "Dodgy Gryffindor student"  I dont think thats Gryffindor-
Game of the Year to me, unique, fun, solid ass game
I love how the entire opening scene is just glossed over in this summery  STOPPPPP “I TRIED TO BRUTALLY MURDER EVERYONE” 💀 literally same
i loved this man thanks😂😂😂
wait but I saw bunch of videos of ppl killing students?
Why so many digs at Rowling?
1:17 He's black, that's how.
I was waiting for the day that this would pop up I my fyp. You are the most chaotic get out together person I've ever seen on this platform. I'm know how you manage it!
What did J.K rowling do to you 😭
I see... So this is where Jeff went after leaving Palheim
Daily reminder there's only 2 gnders
I need to get this game soley for the setting. There is just something about the harry potter setting and asthetic that I really just love.
I still think this should’ve one game of the year
I think mudblood would fit the role better 5:05
Bitch ur sooo funny😅
Enemy appears. Me : avada kedavra
Yessss his Black Magic fascination indeed bahahaha
😂you chose a black gezza
5:05 I know I'm being pedantic, but I'd probably classify mudblood as the Wizarding World equivalent
11 minutes is not a nutshell bro
Very funny video and writing
"Muggles" the Wizarding world N word 😅😅😅
Shotout to Amy Schummer for  helping out!
Scoliosis is a sideways curve of the spine, you wouldn't see it like that.
i'm living for the jk slander
insults JK Rowling repeatedly, yet suckles off the teat of her work. 💀
This feels like written by an AI
Okay so I wake up today and I was in a pissed off mood and found one of your videos. Man I tell you I have not felt this great in a long time after laughing so damn hard. So I know where to come when I need a laugh at any time. Thanks bro.
“I call him swallows because I have the emotional maturity of JK Rowling” has me on the FLOOR 😂😂😂
This video: Tell me, you haven't read what J.K.Rowling actually said without telling me you haven't read what J.K.Rowling actually said.
Just love taking the piss out of jk for most of the video is gold.
not sure how to feel about that starving African joke
I don't remember them accepting black students
Dude did not read harry potter
"Papa Smokes is one fast, athletic lad it's probably because hes black....magic fascination motivates him"
7 kids from 8 diferent women
It's actually a fun game. They have definitely put lot of effort plus the Herbology teacher is hot af.
These jokes are on fire! Chill bro!
But like… papa peli is fit though. We all agree yeah?
That 'girls balls' line was brilliant
Damn I thought this was a review video not a boo-hoo feel bad for trans people video
"im not a game review channel"   yours was one of the best reviews i've seen about the game. im chekcing it before buy it for my 2 friends who are fans of HP since always and wanted to make sure the game is not rubish covered with gold dust. Thanks. Also your video is hilarious, i had a lot of fun with it, take my like.
Dude is bringing some jimmy carr's one liners and i love it. absolutely killing it
This video was mostly funny but stop defending troons it's cringe
You could be a great game reviewer. I’m definitely not Buying this ga e now
10:35 excuse me, the ONLY weak aspect? how about the insulting historical inaccuracy to appease the temporary social standards of 2023? Majority of a BRITISH school faculty is NON-BRITISH, as are most of the kids the game forces you to do quests with. DIEversity is a weakness and kills every avenue of life it touches.
2:51 once again, rowling isnt even transphobic. The dumpsterfire that twitter started was bandwagoned by people who dont know rowling, nor this product. Dont tell me you seriously believe cancel culture 3:43 once again, embarrassing, rowling was actually talking about the trans topic in a way that would benefit them if they acknowledged it. Setting aside emotions so you can work something out is about the most mature thing you can do. 6:21 genuine cringe at this point. Running the same joke 3 times is pitiful but when you were wrong the first time to begin with, LTG bro.. besides theres no way youre a grown man and said the word "marginalized" about the one group that literally has extra benefits and an entire new set of human rights called trans rights.
2:26 well played sir
Oh man, the Rowling roasts were priceless 😂👌
"I better stop talking about girls' balls or JK Rowling will send me a cease and desist letter" pahaha nice
5:00. Omg the runescape reference. ❤.
Here I don't even need a 10-minute video to sum it up for you. It's shit complete waste of money I don't know how they even managed to fuck it up it seems like it would be really easy to make a good game out of something like this but he managed to fuck it up somehow I don't know what to say don't buy it.
'Like France in WW2,they were there but were they?' Man you're awesome.
The jabs agains Logan Paul and Tate were golden!
The guy who you fight in the duel is Sebastian not a gryffindor
They were there but were they 😂😂😂😂😂
did you know you can kill students ingame
It's kind of odd but cool how MP has that great air sign sense of humor which Ravenclaw represents. I am an air sign and also Ravenclaw but I am also crazy.  Also Griffindor is fire, Hufflepuff is earth and Slitherin is water
2:10 EXCUSE ME??? Sebastian Sallow is a SLYTHERIN!
Bro this man is freaking hilarious 😂😂😂
A lady in the streets, hagrid in the sheets 😂😂
He mastered the art of freestyle speaking
2:23 lol
I smoked many joints playing this bad boy
Watching Modest Peli made me laugh after a long time
Was that an attack on titan reference with Connie?
“I guess it’s cause he’s black… magic” Lmmfaoooooooooo good one
Yo that shit was funny asf when you tried to jump off but the staircase saved you haha i wonder if u knew that would happen at all 😂😂
Peli is immune to cancelation
There's definitely worse ways to spend a evening... what a guy
Next Mario game....!!!!  Hahahhahaha litrally spat my drink out hahahha
FYI, once you get unforgivable curses, you can hit them on urclassmates
Did you know that men can't be women?
Papa I love your humor but your african jokes got to chill...your jokes make us sound really bad
What broom are you using
Bro ravenclaw is the best house what you talked about it is hufflepuff
I tried playing this once at a friend's house.  By the time I got through character creation I was already too drunk to get through the tutorial.  Overall 3/10: probably needs more content to flesh out the gameplay.
The game is so bad. I really am mystified by all these people who talk about how great it is. I gave it up in less than 4 hours. How is it that Skyrim is now 12 years old, and it is STILL better Hogwarts Legacy?
The troll reminds me a lot of the ologs from Shadow of War
I love you man.  Runs so fast Probably because he's black, magic, and his brain just stays switched on
Watch out he’s gonna get cancelled
"I better stop talking about girls balls or jk Rowling will probably send me scease and desist letter" 💀💀💀
Every time I watch your videos I'm never sure if I should be triggered or laugh non-stop... I guess I'll just Subscribe
English road man 😂
Most controversial sentences ever said record 💀😂🗿😂
always appreciate the jk rowling slander
hahha
I need another video of this PURE H20 CONTENT!!
Why the jk Rowling hate??
The wizarding world's N word. 😂😂😂😂
4:45 “low hanging fruit”
6:22 funniest shit I've heard all year
Did anyone else notice that in the first DATDA lesson he called the guy he dueled a gryffindor, but hes a slytherin, wtf
3:24 Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration states, among other things, that food can not be conjured. You can duplicate existing food, but not create it out of nothing.
Normiebrain: I play this game, and I know nothing of Rowling's transphobia. Smoothbrain: I won't play this game, and if you support Rowling, you're a transphobe! Minibrain: I play this game, but feel really bad about Rowling's transphobia. Microbrain: I play this game because I support Rowling's transphobia. Pelicanbrain: I play this game, and I won't stop backhanding Rowling for her transphobia.  Be a pelican, drink water!
Ermm. Who was the lady? Can I just give her the money?
👍👍👍😀
Saying that you are surprised your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is still alive had me weak af 😂😂😂😭😂5:57
you kindda look like harry potter
lol this guy can't just play the game without ripping on jk rowling, ubsub.
"A Lady at the Streets and Hagrid at the sheets type of Girl"- Modest Pelican...
The amount of Jabs to JK Rowling in this video😂😂..
No JK Rowling was harmed during the making of this video ....
Wait his name isnt swallows? I have been reading it as swallows the entire tike ive played the game -.-
Best sponsorship read ever^^  I'll never buy such a BS but it sure was entertaining ;P
the RuneScape references are killing my bro
Where is Voldemort? If he wasn't around back then, maybe I just don't understand Harry Potter. Maybe I'm just a boring muggle. Meh.
JK Rowling is the goat
yeah those roasts have dehydrated me imma gonna go drink some hydration 2 o
Im disappoint that you cant attack students
2:26
Politically Incorrect to the extreme. 12/10 video.
Peli u dirty pelican.. u hittin that?
Nogwards Witchcraftcy. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Peaky Pelican
you forgot to say to spread a good word of your channel. to spread the good word of your channel people go around stealing garden gnomes and replacing them with pelicans with the word a modest pelican because that will help to spread the good word of your channel
actually JK Rowling has nothing to do with the game. and no YouTuber and gamer has noticed that professor Weasley has the elder wand spoilers near the end in a cut scene for a brief moment you see the elder wand in professor weasley's hand
J.K. Rowling is right.
I just got a ad of this game
I have been single forever it doesn't work like that.
unfortunate channel name. DO NOT THINK I DIDN'T SEE WAHT YOU DID TO THESE POOR CAPYBARAS
wow this commentary is top tier got yourself a new subscriber
2:10 gryffindor? GRYFFINDOR??
Bro you're a god
Really itching to get this. Idk why but it doesn't look as good as I had imagined it, However the modest pelican has ignited that fire again. It was a wild 30 seconds for me
I played this, at hope to Bang Emma Watson, but she was even to young for me at this Point :/ And i like it Young
Love this non woke channel lol...  Also... That teacher was definitely DTF
Damn bro is that your girl? That YouTube money jus hittin different
An 11 minute nutshell. TLDOpenthatshell
its probably cz his black..💀😭
Discworld is better
"J.K. Rowling taught me that the real magic is hating on marginalized groups." 😆
hes gonna regret not picking slytherin when he find out about a certain 3 spells....
"Sebastian Swallows."💀
Supprised that nobody mentioned my dude annihilating that guys balls at 2:11
I just sparked it up, time to spark up some b... witches
sebastian "swallows" was the kid you dueled earlier. he's a slytherin not gryffindor.
J. K Rowling is amazing, what a world.
"Hogwarts school of poverty" cracked me up
Man what you say is just funny😂😂😂
“If there’s anything jk Rowling taught me it’s the real magic is hating on marginalized groups.” Too soon 😂😂
There is so much sugar in this game, after 20 hours of gameplay i have type 2 diabetes
"muggles  The wizarding world N words" lol  classic
This commentary was mad 😂 Repairo def sounds like Aussie slang
That's the best ad I have seen in a while
This is the funniest thing i've watch so far
hilarious as usual, but your whole schtick with trying to kill everyone is getting old and lame tbh..thats what a 14 years old would do
Bro u need to bring back modest pelican gaming as ur YouTube name
the most viewed part of the video is the ad!!!!!!! This shows the level of nerds that watch your channel.🤣🤣
Love this game! #JKwasright
I happened to be taking a drink when I heard "...first wizard to not die a virgin" and I almost spit it everywhere 😂💀
I'll be real, I legit never went past the third movie and this was when I was a kid, this game really got me into the franchise, I wanted more and more as soon as I fully finished the game, they did well!
at least SOMEONE appreciates my girl balls 💀💀
You've come such a long way!  Remember those days when Patron were there in the end credits.
Hopefully they let you bang that model they trucked in for the ad…. She looks hydrated af.
"Sparking up a joint." Ah, that explains why you keep smacktalking JK Rowling.
Moree
you forgot to mention the bad graphics, and that does not matter what house you are part of , nothing changes...
This is epic lol! The subtle comments are amazing
Why does he actually have the best outro ever
You slid in that running fast because he black 😂😂😂
This is child labour, which i actually support ! :D
Here's a comment to help you with those 7 children
Hi guys, what is this hagrid ps1 video at https://youtu.be/52nmrLSNS8g?t=428 . Any one knows original one?
Are you friends with carey 47
BRO ravenclaw is DOPE. ur rong ravenclaw is the best rantsrantsrants...
I paid seventy dollars for a game I've played two hours of XD  FFS I'm still mad they locked content behind console exclusive. It's 2023 not 2003.
2:09 Griffindor?
The interaction in the game is so boring and limited, just name dropping random characters in some story it wants to force that nobody cares about. No ability to really do anything with the magic, and clunky controls and awful UI... 😢
Oh yeah so English, he’s black
Lady in the streets, hagrid in the sheets
Red dead vid soon please
Petition for a new spell to be named waterusus that turns anything into water
Lmfao and get told there's no quiditch coz dlc won't sell itself
Code GeorgePeli for 100% off
lots of great comedy in here ... though, "marginalized groups", as you say, that force others to conform, bend to their will, and abandon reality do not deserve respect. If you want to pretend to be a calico cat, be a fuggin calico cat, but leave people tf alone about it, do your thing.. doesn't mean the rest of us have to accept it and tiptoe around your bs feelings.
:)
Nah the most replayed section(s)
I don’t think Muggles is the wizard n word  I think that would be mud blood toward muggle born wizards muggle is more like honkey because wizards themselves are a minority😂
danm this game was so naughty and disturbing if you read between the lines.
"One fast athletic lad, its probably because he's black... magic fascination" Lmao incredible
Its probably because he's black... magic fascination 😅
Why does he run fast?
WAIT A MINUTE MODEST WAS PROMOTING A DRINK OTHER THAN WATER?????!??!?
"You woman" had me dying 😭😭😂
bros playing on an xbox 360
Wow that’s all the empirical evidence I need . Leg crack
2:10 excuuuse me? Gryffindor?
The game was way too easy. and the open world is nice. But all the quests are all the same. I wish they put more beasts in the world . that could be a whole game by itself
7 kids to 8 different wives   i feel you bro 2 of my wives are still married to each other :c
why is everyone in these comments so political lmao, its a video game lets play not an election
Click on video, gets Outback Steakhouse Advertisement.   What next, Fosters?
(2:09) Sebastian is a Slytherin, not Griffyndor. Just saying
The J.K. Rowling jokes are in bad taste
good bideo moar
🤣🤣 love the dig at the liberal they/ them guys
I was sad and lonely, so I started drinking...LMAO relatable
Men can't be woman, bro.
Any1 offended its ok he a liberal leftist saying hateful things seeking a communist dictatorship enslavement with Marxist lies 💯💯💯💯💯😂💯💯
intro idea: what's up lads and lases modest pelican with dying light, thanks for 2 mill to help get to 3 mill go on massive murder spree and carve modest pelican into their heads. u can thank me later
Yoooo pelican! Do you play osrs? That deep wilderness reference was hilarious
No way! The deep wilderness osrs reference was too good. Do you play RuneScape mr modest pelican?
This channel never ceases to make me laugh. 🤣🤣
I named my character Mike Lit
Bruh, "He's fast, probably because his black....magic fascination motivates him to train his cardiovascular health. " 🤣🤣
Jesus this is really just punch after punch 🤣
5:06   No that’s “mudblood”
With new mods for this game, pelicans need to be owls.
Dude is out for JK's blood 🤣
Mama Peli has most certainly quenched our thirst. Long Live Ravenclaw
Wilderness pking joke was elite
I am dead LOL
That’s all the empirical evidence I need too.
Deep wilderness PKing? When do we get to see Papa Peli do some of that?
Pawgwarts, fuckin love the reference
This caught my attention cause there’s Destiny YouTuber who who did “Destiny in a Nutshell” videos 😂😂😂
This game was as good as JK Rowling was right.
Fuck you, you got a sub. was blah until the fight an ex mma fighter. Funny prick.
Jk Rowling was not wrong on gender. Stop slandering her when she is telling the truth.
7 kids to 8 different wives… lmaooo
“Herbology teach fine as hell” … okay, good, I’m not the only one 😂
Love this game❤
Anyone played Harry Potter 2 on Gameboy advance? That shit was so exciting as a kid man!
Hi
2:30 that was a very clever joke bro 😂. I agree with Peli , the dialogue is terrible. & unlike him, I like watching the cut scenes. But I get why some people don’t like them.
The only way to change your gender is with magic.
"papa smokes is very fast, it's probably because of his black... Magic fascination" 😆
The house rizzard lol
You would think someone as sharp and witty as the pelican would see through and make fun of the alphabet police. Still love the video though :)
The movies were entertaining but i have never wanted to play one of the games. Playing as a young teenager wearing a half dress and flicking a little wand is thoroughly unappealing. I am more of a Goonies generation kind of guy. Pirate treasure and stuff like that is immersive.....you can all keep your wands and British female oriented fantasy stuff, lol.
I’m amazed at you ability to make almost every encounter sexual harassment
your birds fit mush
I own a entire water purifying plant and give water to the wasteland. KEEPING MY LADS HYDRATED
Wat up lad I modestly love ur videos let's 🥂 with holy water amen
girl balls
I hope Papa Peli hasn't gone woke, JK Rowling never hated on marginalized group. Her opinion is what everone has believed over the past 10 000 years!!
so brave
0:42  Azkaban!
Modest Pelican is the best kind of therapy out there! Besides the Real Therapy, I probably could really benefit from, but I digress. I said what I said and I stand by it.
Will you upload more hogwarts legacy videos?
For pelican tô be saying something positive about a game not letting you kill people, something is reaaaally rigged here. I think somebody is a potterhead or worse...
Play Harry Potter half blood prince ps2 version
Why are British men such cuckolds lol
Can we have a new video pls (im very hydrated)
your videos are awesome, goated take on jkr
What if I told you I’m PS1 hagrid
"If she can fight off dementia, she can fight off anything!" omfg i'm dying
Sneaky osrs reference
Mods ruined me, and I haven't bought legacy yet
America should change should change there Shima, to a pelican
Your video are pretty good
Bro I see you "this will be useful for deep wilderness pking"
Damn how many black/African jokes can be said before we hit puberty?
#TryVeganPlease
Spent half my life in France as a half Irish man and that WW2 joke at the start bloody killed me..
Transphobia the game
I support JK Rowling. This undeserved outrage will pass
commentary gold
Want more Hitman Videos🥲
play a dragon ball any one
My character's name is Eaton Boodie
2:28 Papa smokes is one fast athletic lad it's probably because he's black  magic fascination motivates him to train his cardiovascular health regularly so his brain stays switched on
Funny and fun video but so much was skipped: missions; good and bad beasts, also those you can fly on; potions, various puzzles. This game has much more to offer
You should play sons of the forest
Play more rdr2
Ur banter is terrible
"Emotional maturity"? Whos the boy playing games dipshit
Why did you play the game being such a liberal?
The best sign off I've heard you do! Cheers to that, my friend
Funny for most part, but J.K Rowling is right. Trans women are NOT women
4:49 I see what you did there, you wildness rat
wow JK Rowling so mean for saying there are only men and women... crazy
More please
The wizarding worlds N word 🤣😂
"papa smokes is one fast atheletic lad because he is BLACK magic fascination" we see what you did there XD
That dig at Logal Paul was wonderful 🤣
Me: "I wonder if he will do any JK Rowling jok-"  Never mind
great video
7 kids over 8 wives💀
4:35 bruhhhh 😂
Hi modest pelican your videos never get old i wouldnt shoot you just feels wrong to kill someone you subscribe to. Can you do a video on the game avatar please
It's so cool you got your care provider  to be in your vid, she seems nice.
Hi I luv ur content and I was hoping you could do a San Andreas play through, Big smoke is the goat+water is scrumptious
Do ‘Sons of the Forest’ next!
“7 kids to 8 wives” what in the ——
I picked up that little runescape wilderness meme
Smooches papa
Hey Jeff.
fF
MP deffs got As on his essays
A lot of shade being thrown at JK Rowling lol why tho ?
Pretty cool wizard game
3 Rowling gags in 5 minutes was a bit much, but the rest of the comedy was spot on.  Loved the ad. Had me actually laughing.
I love the JK Rowling slander
How did I miss this upload?!? Better late then never hearing the good word from my favorite bird!
You gotta play atomic heart they got big ass baddies
“Well played JK Rowling you woman”
i get all of the women now because of the gamer drink
that osrs plug tho
If you skip all dialogue/cutscenes, then you have no business talking about whether or not it's good
funny as fuck mate.
Maybe I haven't seen a Papa Peli video in a long time but holy shit that gamer supps ad is legendary
We need more nopixel
No shit, im Papa Tokes hahahahahahaa
When will we see Papa Peli again
Play Spider man miles morales
Imagine Diffindo could actually mutilate.
Rockstar needs to make a Bully Hogwarts Edition.
"Papa Peli" is a better name thenpapa smokes
Oh man, that flabby Amy Schumer got BURNED! Good one, Papa Peli.
Why are you attacking J.K Rowling? Is it because she said a scientific fact, ngl didn't think youd be someone be that stupid
The mario joke was unbelievable
I hated this video but I will still comment, like, and stay subscribed. But get your shit together self-effacing bird man.
thank you for not let the controversy influence your content. Also, congrats on 2 million. Been here for a long ass time. No idea how long, but at least a couple years. Congrats bro.
"He runs fast because his black.... arts knowledge"
2:56 lmfao I thought the same shit when I seen that
Forgot the part we’re all transphobic for playing a video game 😂
Just amazing 🤣
damn peli pulls
You do a video on mount and blade it's so ur type of game
'BLACK' MAGIC FASINATION🤣🤣🤣
Pelican's humor is perfect to me
Real
Racist pause, says a lot.
Damn.  I'm surprised you're making fun of J.K. She stands up against all this insanity in this world that you make fun of all the time,  and the reason I watch your videos.   But I guess I understand you don't want to get "canceled" by this insane minority.
Expecto Malaka
Woke up and chose smoke
This go's to farm , I knew everyone that played this game was homophobic transphobic and the 10000 other phobics .... but now I know pelicans are that as well ... my heart cant take it any longer.
AS YOU PLAY THE GAME, THE QUALITY DROPS
Casually rascist and thinks it’s funny.. hate to be that guy but you’re getting reported.
The true Unforgivable Curse was calling Sebastian a Gryffindor, or dirty Griffers as I call them
Hes fast because hes black
*Prof. Garlick shows up* EXPECTOOOO ERECTIO
That Amy Schumer joke is hilarious because she looks disgusting. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Came to comments to troll "that guy" who corrected you for getting sebastians house wrong but no one did. So I guess Im that guy. Sebastian is a slytherin. There, now I can rest.
Common JK Rowling W
play hitman bro
“I found the guy they will probably use for the next minecraft game” lmao
I didn't understand your JK Rowling comments. Didn't she just say that women are women?
Winona Ryder is in the game. She can be found in the bar
How did you use ancient magiks without desert treasure
The jk Rowling jokes were kinda cringe ngl
most replayed part of the vid is the clip of his gf haha
2:27 ahahahahaha well played pelican well played😂
Jk rowling should be the final boss of this game, with fight difficulty increasing depending on the ethnic origin of your character
world of shitmen wen
Watching your vids is like watching Team America or South Park. You know there are things you shouldn't laugh at, but you do....🤣
Do you remember when we all took powdz together with your cousin Charlie at Griffiths park in Eltham in like 2010???
The bit at the end was pure facts xD
Is 30+ too old for this? I need a blood mod
probably because he's black          magic fascination motivates him🤨
JK Rowling has not said or done anything transphobic
He traynsfabic
Finally admitting it in public.... I love you too!
My man... the hit rate of your jokes is worse than the survival rate my neurons after they tried to figure out how "these kids will do anything but have consensual sex with each other" is supposed to be funny. Are you implying they're having nonconsensual sex? Are you implying very young kids are supposed to be banging each other? An "Amy Schumer is ugly" joke? Wrong kind of vintage my man. Most of your audience probably doesn't even know who Amy Schumer is. Swing and a miss bud, rough video.
jake Paul reference 6:05
half blood everywhere dlc 🤣
"I found the guy they will probably use for the next Mario movie" NO YOU DIDNT! 😆
The Mario joke 💀💀💀
Very good
1:28 Peli who is that baddie mate?
Pelicans vrs Harry Potter who wins pelican
My first impressions from hearing about this game are two things  1. You can become a war criminal 2. Everyone thinks the Herbology professor is hot
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
dont understand the internets obsession with this guy
CONGRATS ON 2 MILLLL!!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE YOUR CONTENT YOU BLOODY LEGEND!!!!
Tons of black people jokes and references throughout. Why do you hate black people? So much time spent punching down.
Peli please make more rd2 content you are my favorite channel
The comedy in this one is strong.
2:36 BASEDDDDDDDD
ur gf is hot,  if u make ads with her i will watch every ad  or u can make a dedicated channel just only for ads but dont forget to include her !!
lmao jokes on jokes
Made it two minutes listening to that voice
Why does it look feel and play like another crappy Ubisoft game?
This game put me to sleep 🤦🏿🤡
It's basically a less fun Star wars Jedi fallen order game 🤦🏿
A Harry Potter game without Harry Potter lmao and no quidditch 🤦🏿🤡
Great content
Hitman freelancer soon?
I’ve been watching this guy forever AND I’M NOT SUBSCRIBED TO THIS LEGEND?! Lemme change that.
Am sub
Can you answer me yes or no😊

You're a wizard Harry
So Last Of Up Part 2 Video When ????
Play More Sea Of Theives
I must acquire Gamer Supps
This wizard has the exaggerated swagger of a black teen 😅
Black.. magic
Need you to continue playing this game and spam Avada kedavara to some random kids
If ravenclaw is France than what would Hufflepuff be
7 kids to 8 different wives.... I love this man.
It really looks so surface. You can’t attack anyone in the common areas? It’s for kids. The repair stuff is straight out of the Lego games
7:53  Your guy is wearing AirPods?!
This video is legit hilarious. Well done
Haha 2:29 to 2:33 made me laugh
truely peak gameplay 7:08
Found all these punchlines and one liners annoying as I just wanted to see the game BUT then I heard "Deep wilderness pking" and liked
JK Rowling is right about trans-sexuals. Men cant give birth and women don't have penises.
Is there an option for gender specific pronouns?
This narration sucks. Jokes suck too.
Your secondary name is nearly as good as mine.
Omg his face
Papa Peli, please, I am in need of assistance. Ever since I have subscribed to your channel, I have become an absolute hydrated unit. However, because if this, I have been having trouble keeping all of the hot little mamazitos away. What should I do?
Stoked we finally got that Bully sequel!
This dude is funny but true 😂.  The way you're describing the game sounds like you want Rockstar to make this shit lol. But your critics means nothing when so many people bought the game and plays hours on it.
Hi
The JK Rowling jokes were way overdone and became not funny at all eventually. But overall solid video, I liked when you made fun of the old teacher.
Thumbs up for RuneScape reference. Cheers
Best nutshell I've seen in a while!
*racial undertone intensifies*
Papa Peli hates Protego
how... how the hell? The world full of sdrtr!!! This game is so bad, so incredibly gay! WTF? Why is so popular???... oh, i forgot, i live in world full of pu**ys pmsl! Well... PS that add woman? Im confused? Is she/he? pmsl!!!
Good game but yeah the dialogue is really bad, IMO consequential dialogue is one of the most important aspects of a singeplayer RPG. The replayability could be so good with the houses and dialogue but they really missed the mark on that aspect.
its 2023, Didnt you say you would be doing reaction videos and porn by now?  I wanna see the Peli-porno saga lol
This man understands Advertisement.
"Deep Wilderness PKing" l0l That runescape reference tho :D What if I told you that you have ice barrage in this game?
7:23 is where it paused and shorts started playing number one victory Royale but the sad version
"Lady in the streets, Hagrid in the sheets !"
It's cool how you did a face reveal, I didn't expect you to look so awesome, at least you don't sit in your mother's basement
5:30 pure gold :D
@Modest Pelican - are you going to play any of the Hitman World of Assassination?  I know you enjoy the series but might be burnt out on it but I thought I'd ask.
I lost it at the dabbing scarecrow 😂😂
“I have 7 kids with 8 different wives” 😭😭😭
good save at 2:30
game low key looks boring, developers need to focus on content more and graphics less
Modest pelican is the only person on yt that can be super racist make it funny and not get canceled 💀
Sebastian does indeed swallow
L0L Old School Runescape deep wildy pking hahahaha
GIRLFRIEND REVEAL?!!
I'm actually super glad you decided to play the game despite the left wanting to cancel it. It is an actually good game despite what jk Rowling said
gta harry potter mod
2:26 *chefs kiss* Thats peak 2023 humour
2:28 is absolute prime pelican comedy 😅
Is it just me or does no one pick Gryffindor?
Those trolls are straight out of shadow of war lol. Literally identical.
This is the second video where I've been armor by the first broom lesson. I'm level 19, how did I miss the armor?
this guy wont get over that jk rowling doesnt support trans
Did you already get your mage arena 2 cape?
7 kids to 8 women hold up
This guy collabing with "I did a thing" for a irl flog would be so funny
This guy collabing with "I did a thing" for a irl flog would be so funny
Your editing says "I dont have any black friends". Its ok its ok. You are screaming for attention. You assume you audience is all white and you are trying to softly offend people with dry ass black jokes but, do you. I thought I would give you a Black persons very accurate opinion. Carry on.
4:55 the deep wilderness pking joke because of the ancient magic was incredible lol. Love me some old school RuneScape
I first thought this was a bully mod
PELI I FKN LOVE U U FKN HYDRATED MFKN MIGHTY BIRD
Modest pelican as 0 friends on Xbox :(.. Whe need tho help my friend pelican tho have some friends.
i think you are the only person i have gave a like to for the ad
congrats on 2M also have you been drinking water by any chance because remember you need to stay hydrated :)
Reperum (or however it’s written) is just a time reverse spell, should be pretty op on enemies. You can just reverse them back to cum
What happened, to spreading the good word of your channel ?
I will be eager to see in future videos how dehydration affects magic users. Surely water is a necessity amongst the magic crowd
Mate you've never seen a roadman, donny looks more like some typical American college athlete.
That Scarecrow is a vibe honestly!😂
Would love a part 2❤
This was the most entertaining video in a whole. Joke after joke. Pelican fr goat
Dissapointed in the game, I was so hyped but of course they ruined it..
ok this one made me laugh. like back when i first found ur channel yrs ago laugh
Incredibly proud of Papa Peli's based JK criticism at 6:18 and throughout. It's why I love Geoff: his amazingly tactful, topical joking that consists of 30% humour, 30% spitting truths, and 40% keeping us hydrated 💦❤
It really is such a beautiful game. I just can’t get past the fact that I truly do not give a fuck about Harry Potter. I remember being all about the first lord of the rings movies, and they came out around the same time, to me, it was just kid stuff. I never read the books because I was a little old for those as well. Though I do know a lot of adults enjoyed them. I hear it’s worth getting the deluxe version on the PS5, but I’m having a hard time making peace with spending $80 on a world that beautiful as it looks, never held any interest for me. So why am I saying all this? Because I’m fucking conflicted even now. It really does look beautiful.
Best ad placement I ever seen
better story then fantastic beasts!
2:28 - well played
I think we NEED more RDR2 online.
More please❤
9:40 is dtf down to fuck?or its just my dirty mind
I bet vickman will be able to conquer the land easily with GTA power
Just finished binge watching all your videos not tired but a little bit dehydrated 😊
Chicks with d1x aint it mate.
So the broom teacher is DTF?  I'll have to check this game out but I doubt we'll get the same cut scenes as The Witcher 3.
what baffles me is why he got his sister pregnant in the first place
You should do gta5 videos gta5 is better
i shot rice across my apartment when the woman came on for your ad lmao
“Fat Tony”? ROFLMAO
Wouldn't the wizarding worlds n word be mudblood?
RAVENCLAW 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
Thank goodness it's not online mmo, alot of unwanted headaches and griefers ruining it for everyone, definitely a beautiful game
Thanks modest pelican, I had surgery last Friday and watching this video made me laugh so hard I needed a poop. Now I can stop taking laxatives and go home.
"WELL-PLAYED [NAME], YOU WOMAN" is my new catch-phrase. They will appreciate it around the office.
I could tell by the way u were playing that u desire the death and destruction of all trans ppl
$$$$$$$$$$
I saw what you did there.. with that because “he’s” black, magic 😂
he payed the woman for that ad
Dodge-rolling instead of protego...  Found the Elden Ring player.
Intro idea:hi lads and lasses,modest pelican here.if you enjoy this video.please go back in time to 9/11 and tell everyone in the World Trade Center to subscribe to modest pelican before they die.as this really helps spread the good word of my channel
You and Cheru should collab
I support hating on the .01% of “marginalized groups”.
Gore mod needs to happen
Bro on god Professor Garlick got me (my wizard avatar I promise) bricked up
2:47 💀
“7 kids to 8 different wives” the most masculine thing I’ve ever heard
Amy Schumer 😂
Good vid. Terrible jokes.
You were fighting off a Slytherin student in the duel not a Gryffindor,FYI lol
Why are you shitting on JK for something she believes in. It's called faith. She believes what her Bible says. She didn't come up with the concept of not supporting evil. If you're gay, fine... But others don't HAVE to agree. Idk why shes judged for what the Bible says.
Papa peli the legend 💪
those poor kids were not hydrated.thankfully peli is here to hydrate them with his magic
Sensational.
"This will be great for deep wilderness pking"   legend.
Anyone else not realize that is Sallows and not Swallows until Papa Peli pointed it out? 😂🤣😂
What's that spiral that shows up when he's flying on the broom? Wtf I haven't seen that yet
Keep making good videos and keep shitting on the woke liberals 😂
The books got darker, maybe the games will too?
The only person who can play this game without getting harassed and doxed.
Don't become a libtard Peli. J.K. Rowling has more emotional maturity than all of the "woke" youth put together. Please don't become one of them. You're better than that.
I live in Louisiana, USA, and our state bird is the brown pelican.
He just made Jude Bellingham
2:06 spit my tea
GTA Hogwarts
You can set a piece of armor's appearance as another piece of armor and you can also make it appear as if there's nothing there. For example, making that stupid fucking scarf go away while you have a full plated armor set you fucking scrub. Also, I love you too.
Dangggg! You hit this one like a spiked baseball bat
Honestly seems kind of boring
Man that deep wilderness pking reference……
Your cat is named Fat Tony? You seem like a pretty cool guy.
i’m so happy to see more uploads! it keeps me extremely hydrated !
"The one time hogwarts cares about their students" when he tried jumping off the stairs killed me
Long time fan, I am unsubscribing.  I can't support anyone who supports JK Rowling
10:44 Amen
2:25 he got me in the first half.
No way he used nikes slogan during a sponsored ad lmfaooo I love Peli
As always way too funny but 5:40 "no quiddich this year because DLC isn't going to sell itself" may be the funniest thing I have heard all month.
How has Pelican not gotten canceld
2:27 Peli on thin ice with cancel culture
What's up bro? Couldn't find any dodgy malaka's
This video made me laugh sooooo much, I was bummed when it ended. Thank you for making my day with this!
😂😂😂👍 literally made my day
Why do you say malaka all the time??
because he's black... magic AMAZING 2:25 loool Funny
ok ok
I love how some people do millions sub special. The legend that is modest pelican just mentions it very briefly at about 4:05.  I’m going to go on a 1-200 person killing spree and then call the police to tell them my name is modest pelican. I’ll then phone the newspapers and tell them as this will really help spread the good word of your channel and these techniques are obviously working very well.
Going crazy on the jk Rowling jokes just to appease the trannys instead of just being you is like ign trying to lecture us about politics while reviewing this game. Unsub, dislike, do not recommend and block. Be a game channel, don't be political.
😅
The best video introduction ever
he looks like luke from the haunting of hill house
Peaky blinder fit is clean 🔥
truly a game from ps3 era with ps4 graphics
"Real magic is hating on marginalised groups" 😭😭☠☠
Lady on street Hagrid in sheet dammm
the mirror should work fine if you have the raytracing on i believe though i am not sure maybe the uvs are fked up if they used a normal material instead of reflective unreal engine also generates the same reflective surface in gtx
As an African warlord I find your comments insensitive to my community.
"I have seven kids to eight different wives and I need youtube views to feed the rugrats" -That was hilarious :D
Lady in the streets, hagrid in the sheets.. Whaaat 🤣🤣
DTF :Down To Fish 👍
I forgot this channel existed. Voiy is overtaking yo
What would happen if harry use gun on voldmort
Hahahahahahahaha, calling ravenclaw the home of forgettable side characters when hufflepuff clearly takes the crown
Just a top notch and funny as hell video. Also FUCK JK Rowling.
Was having a bad day and your videos alway make me laugh my ass off bro!!! Keep it up!
Ps1 hagrid (only ps1) is bouta make me act up
Gah damn that herb class teacher
My brother so ugly gamer supps did not work on his crush. But still 10/10 cuz it kept him hydrated.
I would absolutely pay to have a graphically violent version of a game like this.
It’s a great game, I don’t miss quiditch but I would like co op.
great osrs joke
Peli, I'm glad to see that you are getting funnier over the years. I couldn't resist subscribing, haha.
this is the funniest most passive aggressive video i’ve ever seen
Most hydrated wizard
You the most racist person ever 🤣🤣🤣
1:24 Am I the only one who noticed the ShyLily arT
10 hours ago when I started watching this video I didn't think my life would feel this shit
10:46 😵‍💫
Men can’t be women and women can’t be men that’s my tedtalk
"it's Cause He's Black" :D
I’m dying this gold. Hahaha.
thumbs up for the runescape refrence
Blah blah Jk Rowling is a something something phobe......relax man no need for the virtue signals in  your gameplay video of Hogwarts Legacy.
https://youtube.com/shorts/qc0CXah0eOc?feature=share
Modest Pelican is based just like jk.
https://youtu.be/JkvgJa9adRw
Fight look so boring
That part at  2:30 got me well played
You know a good Harry Potter GTA game would be to have first if you go on a rampage the teachers go after you. Then the Ministry of Magic sends soldiers after you. Finally they send dementors after you.
mothers of the starving kids in africa scold their children when they dont finish their food because of that one kid in this game
We love Balls & all weather they are attached to a man or woman.
So many of your jokes are not good
Deep wilderness PKing. I love osrs
Hilarious 😂 not everyone on YouTube is gutless
2:29 is crazy
Feels like you're a bit burned out from this youtube thing. In your Hitman days you were so much brighter and happier. Hope you're fine.
You should try to play project zomboid
"Ravenclaw, the home of forgetable side characters"  Me: *sad Ravenclaw noises*
Love the RuneScape reference! Still going hard on my Ironman. I recently killed every bird in the game besides the pelicans, to spread the good name of the channel
The RuneScape reference. Love it !!
How many lame JK Rowling shots can one take in a single review. Imagine letting her own you like that.
The Amy Schumer jokes get me every time 🤣
Young Money Clan made you
Peli wieder Gottlos unterwegs, love ya
Deep wilderness pking I felt that one 😂💚 osrs
Kony 2012
Found the guy they will use for the next Mario game 😂😂😂😂
lmao, "ancient magic to be used in wilderness for PKing". I guess everything outside of hamlets can be called wilderness here, so basically :D
Well played J. K. Rowling you woman.
Another banger as expected from the flying Jesus himself
Lemme say, the mirrors look dope on PC
Dear modest pelican we (nike) are suing you for 20 million dollars for using our qoute “just do it” good day
Every time a game comes out I search up the game name then in a nutshell because you upload every game that comes out thank you
I don't know how you just keep speaking like you do... is it scripted or do you improvise?
Honestlly with that ad I think it would be a crime not to buy some gamer sups
While an amazing ad for Gamer supps on all it's own merits can we just point out that Pelican legit might be a Rizzard of the darkest arts because she was stunning lol
the ad makes me what to buy game supps
"I find the guy that they will probably use for the next mario game" LOL
Worst review EVER
It's probably because he's black... Magic fascination 🤣
Please for God's sake, create more videos like this. Please Please Please
yeah congrats! 2m is amazing, keep up the good work!
As a trans Harry Potter fan and long time viewer and enjoyer of this channel I thoroughly appreciate the shade thrown at Rowling :))
Leave it to this guy to literally butcher any game he plays.
Your videos are top drawer, well played
hogwarts school of poverty got me laughing so hard
Mate, finally a gaming channel with my sense of humour, laughed my ass off.  Nice little bit of honesty too regarding the world we grew up reading about now being playable, I'm still on the fence as to whether I will buy it now, or wait 4 years for it to be free when no one gives a shit about it anymore.
Women do not have penises. Men do not have vaginas. Never have and never will.
That girl's balls line got me 🤣💀🤣
'Blo'hole blast"
It’s unnerving how similar our opening gameplay was. Watching your video makes me think that I might have to see a clinical psychologist.
so much misogynist and racism in this video . u dont deserve 2 mil
7 kids to 8 different wives lol
Pt2 🙏
Can you play the old mw2 game?
the racists black coments arent cool
You sir are how I plan to experience this game
It is kinda raciste 3:26
What is a witch?
Ewww diversity admissions at Hogwarts??
7 kids to 8 wives 🤔
This one video made me subscribe. So many jokes that can go over your head if you're not paying attention. Too many to quote 🤣🤣first video I've seen as well so will have a look at the channel
Poppa smack gonna be my name
I WANT BLO HOLE BLAST AGMER SUPPS SO BADLY BUT THEY BEEN SOLD OUT FOR WEEKS
Wait. Is that shylily on the gamer supps?
The france comment made me chuckle tbf
Thanks. I needed to hear someone say they love me today!
I love the old school RuneScape references. Thought I caught one in another video and wasn't sure but now I know lol
the game sucks and you made it slightly better by hydrating everyone around you!
https://youtu.be/27Bhk3Qc6bQ This is it ..
Hogwarts Legacy is a magnificent tour de force, a symphonic opus of immersive wizardry that transports the player to the mystical realm of J.K. Rowling's beloved creation. The intricately detailed graphics, paired with a hauntingly beautiful score, create a sensory feast for the eyes and ears.  The game's lush open world brims with spellbinding secrets, hidden chambers, and perilous creatures, inviting players to explore every nook and cranny of the legendary wizarding school. The player character, as a wizard-in-training, is imbued with a sense of agency and empowerment, granting the ability to wield spells, brew potions, and engage in thrilling duels.  The meticulously crafted narrative is interwoven with choice and consequence, allowing players to shape their own unique story within the hallowed halls of Hogwarts. The spellbinding narrative, coupled with the fluidity of the game's mechanics, results in a captivating and enrapturing experience that leaves one spellbound and yearning for more.  In conclusion, Hogwarts Legacy is a triumph of interactive entertainment, a bewitching blend of enchantment and adventure that is sure to cast a spell over players of all ages.
They should re-name Ravenclaw to Peliclaw to spread the good word of your channel bro🤙🏻
I doubt JK cares about what you say about her, while she sits on the giant pile of cash that is the royalties from this game.
That was the review I needed, but didn’t deserve.
Damn… Wizard101s update is sick
I tried to stay sufficiently hydrated but I couldn't quite stop blowing chunks around the Bieber-style sell out on double standards.
Thank you for calling out the snitch issue with quditch that shit always annoyed me so much
Is there a cup holder cosmetic DLC for the broom? Non binary wizard witch needs some adequate hydration for a long countryside jaunt
It's probably because he's black....magic fascination.
Relax while gaming 😌
DLC isn't going to sell itself.
u my favorite Australian papi peli
Pelis real imaginary gf is hot.. I'm sold for  hydration.
That ending summary convinced me to subscribe. God speed MP
2:13 F in chat for the guy's Stupefied nuts?
Don't remember there being so many black people at Hogwarts in the films
Your advertisement is on point, I brought 40 kilos of gamer supp and i am now drowning in females. Stay hydrated.
Great.  Looks like a good game. Poor PM. Can't go on a rampage. Has to be a goody goody.   Lol. . 😀. Was that PG lady, in the beginning.  Wow Good pick. If it is. . 1st time . Seeing a new game in the beginning . By PG.  Still catching up from the last 4 years  games. Check them out. Very funny guy. 👍😊
They aint marginalized only lost souls
Okay but like did everyone get paired with ravenclaw?  Like to compare, comment to compare your house
As I’m currently smoking a joint and booting up hogwarts legacy
So, I did some research about why people are calling JK Rowling transphobic.  The two things I found were her saying "There are biological differences between cis and trans women, and denying that won't do any good", and "we shouldn't rush people into hormone therapy that's going to wreck their body unless they're mature enough to make that decision"  Are these really the sorts of opinions that are causing this boycott? I was hoping that the LGBT community was mellowing out a bit when they trashed Velma, but I can see now that is not the case.
Men can only be men. Women can only be women. Till technology figures out how to make a male have a baby, this is true. There is a phycological epidemic, like anorexias up tick and many others have had at moments in time. Thousands of percent increases of this group of people in an OBVIOUS sign there is something else happening at this moment of time. There are true individuals like this, but most are confused gay men that will regret their decision most of the time.   I love your Rowling jokes. A person who created an entire franchise that resonates across the world, cultures, genders, and whatever other labels you want to attach to people. I'm sure she's a total moron, right? I'm sure she has no education, hasn't considered how her statement may effect her products, etc. Rowling and others have enough brain cells to examine todays topics for themselves. You have google, go use it.
pelis girl is bad
Congrats on 2mil peli Love the vids
"probably because his black..magic...."  dead
Its great game I watch on YouTube so I dont need buy it,also I was very fast boring cuz I never watch all Henry Potter movies so idk, overall was like visual novel experience with little action.
they should just add a ak 47 all their problems would be solved. dark wizard, no problem you have an ak
You make this boring game look actually good.
"7 kids to 8 different wives"
My man aint scared of twiter users
It's all about Pelican Ball's, in every game!
My potronus charm is a pelican
All JK Rowling has said is that biological sex exists and is a reality. That does not make her "anti-trans". Humans are not some magical creature where more than 2 sexes exist. So stop with the cheap and easy shots on her and maybe appreciate all that she has done.
this is basically Bully 2
My character is named Moe Lester
Instead of getting bully 2… we got this.
I have bought $6000 worth of gamer sups. I am the god of rizz.
deep wildy pk haha i heard that cheeky runescape reference lmfao. you sound so much like the osrs youtuber Lagunarium too l0000l
“I have the emotional maturity of Jk Rowling” yeah because saying “I know and love trans people” while she gets death and rape threats daily from trans activists on Twitter is totally immature.   Look, I get that you’re just saying that because you’re a coward afraid of being cancelled, but don’t spread misinformation.  Have fun playing the game pretending Jk rowling is the type to send cease and desist letters for telling jokes when it’s activists that are literally putting people on lists for even playing this video game.
I'm really happy Amy Schumer agreed to be a guest star in this game
Pappa Smokes finna make Voldemort look like the hero
Now we need to turn Middle earth into this!
I straight lost it when said he this will be great for deep wilderness PKing
Finished the game but idk what else to do. This game needs more stuff in it
Why are people comparing this to GTA
5 years old kid uses the unforgivable curses. Real chad player Stupifies the entire Hard playthrough.
I fucking love your sense of humor bro. Bravo
Your teacher dies at the end and there's nothing you can do about it :)
Boycott this Pelican. He likes this game, so he clearly hates trans people.
Had to watch the video twice was crying Lmfao the whole time good commentary!😂💀
The virtual best mirror in his room is the best part of this video
This game is sort of like bully but with kids in robes wielding wands instead of spud guns
The story actually get better with time, but people who play competitive in pvp probably won’t have the patience for it
I’m getting this game in April since then it comes out on PS4. Amazing that you can get your own dorm room, beasts, and new spells to unlock. Amazing graphics. If you beat the game, you should watch @Hollow
"sparking out a joint"? you mean enjoying a glass full of fresh spring water?
"They were there, but were they?" 🤣
FYI Rowling is pronounced ROLLING
He sprinted with all the swagger of a black wizard   -the guy who reviewed miles morales
Modest Pelican has so much Rizz from Gamersupps
I know th Jk Rowling jokes are just jokes but in reality she really didn't say anything offensive.
Magic is gay
This is the coolest looking avatar, 💕
As a subscriber, I like you as a friend only.  Do I need to file a restraining order against you?... I truly fear when Australia conquers the art of ocean travel now; thanks for that, you Stalker. 🙏
pls pls pls pls do a play through of this with your majestic commentary. no cap my fav vids on yt since i found you many years ago. and you're a fellow aussie its a dream come true.
Hey Papa Peli, Is Pat Cummins your lost brother?
Need to calm down with your poor taste JK Rowling jokes bro
Black..............................magic 🙂🤣
congrats on 2mil🥳🥳🥳
The Half Blood everywhere DLC one was gold xD
Hey Pelican, by playing this game you're officially a fatphobic transphobic nazi  Oh yeah and racist!
Why did you make the London roadman black when your white?
Harry Potter meets GTA?
The schumer joke got me xD
what a malaka lol great video...
fuck yes runescape reference you need to do a vid on it
“If she can fight off dementia, she can fight off anything” 😂😂😂😂😂
The ad was the best bit, cos hydration is important.
Nice
Kony??!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Had me laughing so hard! Such a throw back
Your such a charming basterd xD luv your commedy man!
That’s not duck it’s a pelican!
Blokes missus is hot
I love the triggering jokes constantly flowing 👌🏻 Specially mario and the black magic got me hard.
I just wish it was multiplayer like GTA or co-op
looks pretty anti semetic to me!!! LOOOOL
Bro if that’s his gf/wife she bad 💀💀💀
1:21 W
Hating on marginalised groups... is that like people hating on a woman or women for what they believe in?...
It’s not marbles, it’s gobstones you nerd.
wtf. companies are going bonkers.
hugh... humour overshadowed by lil woke commentaries.. she pretty much said a woman is a woman and a man is a man .. she's far from a hater. If anything she's holding an opinion that's been held by 99.99% of people for 99.9999% of our history.   I know you're being silly but your woke more than usual is showing and it's a turn off.
“This will be great for deep wilderness pk-ing”  lolololol
you fell off
I can’t wait for the hub mods
the jk rowling slander and im here for it
"it's probably because his black" 💀
did bro just do a face reveal for an ad? or has he shown his face before and im just stupid
JK Rowling is right though.
The line about Ravenclaw and France during WW2 just earned you sub.
“But he sprinted cuz he’s Black…magic” BROO lol
Damn bruh nice pull.
Modest Pelican going for woke points with some of these jokes
Papa Smokes always the house rizzard
No matter what i do i wil never g’et Women
Papa Peli's wamen blinked "help" in morse code
The burns on JK Rowling here are amazing! 11/10 .  +1 for Deep wildy pking.
You’re hydrated bazzer
"The beaters, the chasers, the candlestick makers"
Idk what else I expected but the vid was basically just shitting on Jk Rowling and I loved every second of it
So we just gonna ignore Peli’s god tier Jake Paul diss?
Please never stop making Amy Schumer jokes
Bahaha this is the greatest game review/walkthrough ever
Really?…. The combat is the only thing keeping me away from the game. God of war, sekiro, elden ring , blood borne, shadow of war, RDR, Witcher 3, last of us, dying light 2, I can keep going but those games I listed all have unique, satisfying, and most importantly extremely fun and rewarding combat systems.  I’m sorry to Harry Potter fans I don’t mean to hate on ur game it looks fantastic maybe I’m missing something. To me it looks like it’s not challenging and ur just spamming a button.  I have not played tho. Can someone who has and enjoys it explain to me what the combat is REALLY like if my take on it is wrong. Like is there dodging or a perry system?  Pls someone tell me if there is any challenge to the combat or if it’s just not supposed to be a combat focused game. (I want to like it lol but at $70 I need at least one person to describe the combat and make it sound fun to me)
Harry Potter is a shitty franchise for children and rainbow flag people.
Congrats on 2 mil
congrats on 2m man : )
The whole time playing this game I was wondering how you would make jokes. You have the most entertaining video game channel. Appreciate the content man
Rowling is pronounced like rolling as in rolling on the floor laughing at trans
2:26 perfectly delivered line
Apparently this channel has trans itioned to cringe.  You know who is transphobic, other trans people.  As in, no, they don't accept other trans people as a replacement for the gender they find attractive.  People like what they like and lying about what your gender parts is not acceptable in society.  No, you can't just say you are X, when you are Y, just because you feel like it.  And all you woke sympathizers thinking you're all enlightened and edgy are just plain dumb sheep.  The end.
Just finished all the school stuff for the week and pop over to Youtube for some relaxation and am greeted by a Peli video. Genuine good vibes right now.
Bro was slick with it 2:30

Quidditch is the dumbest game ever.
I was too old by the time Harry Potter became a thing so I never got into it.  That said, this game looks kinda fun.  Anybody know if it would be good for a guy that doesn't know a damn thing about Harry Potter?
Me and the bros being transabhorrent
We can't kill people? That's what i mostly wanted to do! Oh well, i guess i'll just play video games instead
got me with the runescape reference
Papa smokes is a master in crack-inhalio
I would totally play GTA Hogwarts City
I wonder how the hog got warts. And are we talking swine or meatlogs here?
How did you not talk about Sirona Ryan. . .
I love that instead of boycotting the game he just flamed up JK rowling. Handled with class
"the guy they''ll probably use for the next mario game" had me dying
Actually couldn't have gotten a better game review
1:55 clipping knee to cat's face lol 2:30 fast because he's black magic.
Does that 15th century armour provide you with any.. armour?
“The headmaster said no quidditch this year because the DLC isn’t gonna sell itself”  Never before have I laughed so hard at something I hate so much.
“He runs so fast probably because he’s black…….magic..”😂😂😂
I love the very subtle social criticism towards JK Rowling - almost not noticeable but demonstrates awareness. Papa Pelli was, is and always will be known for striking the perfect balance between satire and family friendly humor
ma' man !
Good, but dialogue is kinda wack. But pelicans don’t usually like cutscenes in any games
Man this Bully DLC looks dope.
definitely one of the best harry potter games to come out.
all this game did was distract my missues while i had a wha.... something
Press triangle for “potatoes”! 😂
This fucking guy lmao
I love you too Papa Peli
Pelican is that ur gf?
First time watching this guy's videos and by the end I had to subscribe 🤣
Sincerely hope there is proper end-game content coming. Loved the ride up until the final mission was done, then everything fell apart. Need to hit max level to get the best gear and upgrade it so I can... oh there is nothing left to do.
When the quiet kid gets his wand out
I can't believe I can say this and be 100% serious and not joking, but peli is ballsy for playing this game about 1800s wizzards
I'm angry there are is trans disabled black muslim zulu representation
I LOVE you content and always have but THIS, this is amazing. F the whiny little A holes and their "activism".
Nothing feels good than being loved by papa peli
could have made this a 1 minute video of walking upto a troll and avada kedavra
W game
I bought pounds of Gfuel but nothing happened in tell I got yours and used code PELI. Now I can get any women I want. Thank you Papa Peli
POV 0:06  : You're playing Hogwarts Legacy, but you're from the Hood 💀
The head master said no quidditch this year cuz DLC isn't gonna sell itself. 😂😂😂😂 That's fkn great!!!  Hats off to the devs! I don't give a shit a about Harry Potter and thought this game was gonna be trash given the constant delays. But this is the best open world I have played since GTA5. Didn't expect this game to be thIs good at all.
Jokes in this one are very black magic infused. They hydrated my brain successfuly and I'm not even a woman.
The France comment 🤣
“Probably because his black… magic..” 😂  And trust me as long as you aren’t a dude acting like a girl, J.K.R. doesn’t care 😂
There are a few glitches and bugs that need to be cleaned up on PC (lighting, voice, and some player mechanics) but overall it's fairly impressive and more like how a game release should go. The combat and flying mechanics are also so fun and smooth I actually giggled like an idiot when I first got my brooms because it's just so fun to fly around in this game. Last game I enjoyed this much was probably Tsushima.
You should fly your broom just over the water, lean down and open your mouth as that's a great way to stay hydrated.
Nice cosplaying
I’m here for the JK Rowling slander 😂 it’s what she deserves.
How dare you call JK Rowling a woman
WHo on earth is that lady? Does she have her own channel?
The fact the put a tunnel you can roll into then not move in in-between two fights ......fuck that's bullshit
Can you buy me the game for ps4 😂😂😂😂 ik you wont
realest outro ❤
Your commentary makes me laugh 🤣🙏💕✅
Trans looneys are a "marginalised group" good joke. They support rapists who transition to pretending to be women so they can abuse more women in the female jails.
Yeah I have been enjoying this game. Side note. If you want some downtime on multi-player, you should get hell let loose. It has a pretty large aus/kiwi kiwi community on console and is crossplay between consoles.
Part 2
J.K. Rowling "hating on marginalized groups". You had to go there, didn't you? Unsubscribed, disliked, but at least I commented, huh?
Black Magic
i love to laugh at all the crybaby wokesters who attempt to find problems with this game that don't exist
This video is epic Peli
0:46 “Ravenclaw is like France during ww2, they were there, but were they?” 💀💀💀💀
Well shit you getting cancelled been one hell of a career
This channel is like the family guy of YouTube
Retired MMA fighter who doesn't know magic 😂
What is everyone making a big deal of the game? Some people said they’re not gonna play it,because of wat JK Rowling said on Twitter.
Me: taking a break from eating a weed edible and playing HL to watch this video
2m 🤘
The game is good... The creator BAD
Too many jkr jokes, or at least I hope they were mere humor.
the joke at 2:55 fr had me stopping the vid so a could laugh for 10 minutes
I bet u wish u was black. U inspired by us
These graphics are so weird. They kind of look good, but also dated at the same time.
Ight bro you cancelled
At first I was proud he had the b@lls to review this game. Then he made it apparent how J.K Rowling saying there's 2 genders sent in into a spiral of virtue signaling.  I guess saying men or women exist, as in science exists like y or x chromosomes was too much for our boy. He's sarcastic and this could all just be a joke, I then apologize but ppl are really weird on this one
Papa smokes is one fast athletic lad, it's probably because his black     magic fascination. 😂
"he's fast probably just because he's black" is what I heard
I support  J.K Rowling there is no such thing as girl balls. Careful the lgbtrtfg mafia can cancel you for playing this game
OMG MODEST PELICAN IS TRANSPHOBIC???
That was the best god damn advertising I’ve ever seen and mrballen does some great ones
Pop smoke looks like Mbappe
4:52 '''this will be great for deep wilderness pking ' 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
“English roadman” “Dressed like a peaky blinder”
The gamer supps ad made me spit out my gamer fuel.
Read what J.K. Rowling actually wrote my guy, instead of blindly believing hearsay & headlines.
7.55 congratulations on becoming a father!
7 kids to 8 wives…
You're the only guy I want a review from
How do I get modern clothing in this game?? I want my character to wear skinny jeans with some adidas and a polo shirt
I want a rated M version of this game and see what you could do.
Flamed JK 😂
People are right you know.....since my download completed I've had this weird fear of trannies and a deep seeded hate for jews looool
Dragons dogma has a more in depth magic system than this game does, graphics don't make a good magic game. good vid though.
First video of yours I have watched. Detailed and varied gameplay footage and hilarious commentary. I will be back
I’ve never seen a first make fun of more first years more
2:25 I see what you did there :'P
I spent two weeks impregnating every girl in my small town and I plan to name all the kids modest pelican gaming to really spread the good word of your channel.
This was hilarious, I hadn’t watched a video of yours in a long time. I forgot how funny you are.
funny as fuck
JK Rowling did nothing wrong
Jk is a based female god
That black joke though xD  J. K. Rowling is just a true feminist who is uncomfortable with how some of their movement has been weakened by another movement.  I just started this game yesterday. Thanks for the hilarious video as usual.
Ancient magic - «this will be great for deep wilderness PK’ing». I smell a runescape reference and I think you’d make some amazing content in that game. Maybe get one of the bois with you, or even Zanny, you two are a great combo
because he / his black... magic fascination hahahah
I used the imperio curse to mind control the professors so they could teach the good word of modest pelican.
I thought it was Sebastian Swallows for an embarrassingly long time too
i buyed gamer the veberage cause of papa smokes and now they're accusing me of a "Discount User"
Trans is wrong
Peli I stopped paying child support so I could buy your onlyfans
"I better stop talking about girl's balls or JK Rowling sends me a cease and desist letter"   I died. Amazing
i love water
Looks mid
God bless.
i am impressed how much you managed to make fun of a petty transphobe so many times through out this short video
Retired mma fight and Jake Paul came straight to my head
11m of just shitting on j.k Rowling and the defense against the dark arts teacher lmao 🤣
Disaster relief earthquakes welcome to Turkey
Can you sit in chairs? I like to sit whilst I take bong hits.
What really stands out to me with the combat in this game specifically. This is a world of limitless magical possibilities, and yet they give you a f*cking dodge roll to evade attacks. So there's no spells that can move the caster a meter in any direction instantly or make them incorporeal for a second or two? Seriously I won't be buying this game because it's just FromSoft combat without the variety
This game reminds me of bully I thought it was going to be ridiculous but now I wanna play it lol
god this game looks fun
This like an updated version of bully .
There's only two genders
Loved the video man! Awesome puns all around. I would definitely say though, Hogwart's "N" word would be more considered "Mudblood" rather than "Muggle."
02:25 💀💀😂
The jk Rowling joke had me in stitches great vid
“No Quidditch this year because DLC isn’t going to sell itself!” 🔥😂
"Since I have the emotional maturity of JK Rowling"  LMAO, once again, you knocked this entire video out of the park, you absolute legend!
Babe wake up modest pelican posted!!!
1:39 best add ive evea seen...id like more...dam my comp is so crap i cant game but seeing her yep id like a drink or 2...a tall drink
BRITISH🇬🇧 roadman not English
I hope the Manscape ad right in the middle of the discussion about balls was intentional. If so, bravo.
I feel like this pelican smokes more weed then me.
Not funny
Modest Pelican is literally the funniest youtuber rn 😭🤣
Congratulations for the 2M papa peli stay always hydrated you bloody legend.
This videos jokes will cause mass casualties
mans giggled a few times x
1:25 You see why Dark Viper was trying to speedrun his way into Modest Pelican's girlfriends pants.  Also, did other people assume Gamer Supps was a fake thing for a long time? It just seems so 90s cringe I assumed it had to be a meme I didn't know about.
Pelican forgot his usual opening.  I'm here to assist (read the following with your best (or worst) monotone Aussie accent: Hello lads and lassies.  Modedt Pelican here.  If you enjoy this video, please LIKE it and write to J.K. Rowling and tell her to to change Harry's name to "Modest Pelican" as this really helps spread the good word of my channel.  I'm also renaming my house and crew from Raven Claw to "Wiz-Kids of Virgins".  Our goal is to learn magic, pick-up chicks, and stay well-hydrated. On a side note, now that I've reached 2M subscribers because you enjoy my content, it's time, I think, for you to show your appreciation.  So, each of you should send me one dollar.  Not an Australian dollar.   I want real money.  You know...USD.
Literally my opinion but I dislike this guys commentary so much I couldn’t finish the video
"half-blood everywhere" was excellent
lol @ RuneScape reference
I love all the JK slander
Funniest YouTuber - no contest.
peli really just uses his girlfriend for content theres no actual relationship there
Your content is so inspirational! I stopped eating food and I replaced it with water because I need to spread the good work of your chanell in hospital
Got to say, I love the unreleanting Amy Schumer references...
Kudos to Jo Rowling for having an opinion. Get over yourselves
I wish this was 20 minutes long.
This is NOT a game review channel??
Daddy peli is god
where gta roleplay
I love how ‘diverse’ Hogwarts is BEFORE Harry Potters time, there must be a gray area at somepoint in the near future where the European population of the school decides to ‘get rid’ of other ethnicities 😅😂
Great Game :)
Gonna go check out that ps1 hp now…
I like to think Professor Hecat hasn't retired yet because she feels any new teacher will be bad and she wants to make sure her students are well taught to protect themselves and their loved ones.  Or Hogwarts pays shit so she's stuck working into her old old age.
I named myself ‘Hairy Potty’, I couldn’t resist it.
Spot on with professor Garlick. She foine
6:03 I’m glad you said 99% because otherwise you were about to get confringoed for not knowing how the 1994 quidditch World Cup ended
2:26: He had us in the first half not gonna lie
This will be great for deep wilderniss pking 😂😂🗿 love the osrs reference
😂😂😂😂😂 like france during WW2
If you're sparking up a joint to play this game with, you better have some H2O on the side for the rehydration
1:21 best comertial I have seen in my life.   I feel like I need to buy some gamersupps now
I shall now go to McDonalds and ask for 2 million cups of water to celebrate this monumental achievement.
“ the real magic is hating on marginalized groups” hahahahahha
10:48 papasmokes confirmed
If she can fight off dementia was the best hahahahaha
Congrats on 2 mil!! I have always enjoyed watching your videos and I hope you continue to make them! love your work.
Congratulations on 2m subscribers!  Can I borrow $10,013?
'deep wilderness pking' lmfao
“No Quidich this year. The DLC isn’t going to sell itself.” I didn’t think they would include such truth bombs in the dialogue.
This is the only gam review I listen to
Whining about a person that's helping you to make money.  Make some cash off of them as long as you put them down.  Got it, Peli.
I love your vids you dodgy malakar, keep up the awesome work
Hey! Congrats on 2M!! That’s quite a legacy you’re building.
It was so nice of them to give Amy Shumer some work
Another banger as usual
professor Garlik fine asf
Top MP is back
there is no way that’s his girl she’s hot asf
professor weasley makes me wanna do crime fr
Such a dissapointment but the game looks simply boring8
I swear it's always ravenclaw
keep up with the good work! I love Pelicans!
Is all the attacks on JK Rowling's meant to keep you from getting boycotted. Or are you actually dense enough to think there's some miracle way you can change your chromosomes. The woman is right and trans people are pissed about it get over it. When Uncle Bob says he's God you take him to a psychiatrist. I wonder what a God change doctor would look like. J.k. Rowling's write great fiction novels. But the woman has a firm grasp on reality.
💜
what a save at 2:28
I cant play till 4 april. And i sayed to myself no spoilers dont watch ant videos. But if daddy Peli uploads i need to watch it
4:50 video on old school runescape????
Modest Pelican can’t get cancelled, we will all die of dehydration!
All this panning of JK Rowling has me dead😂
Another amzing vid
Wow, 2 millions subs. Unbelievable to see how fast you're growing now. Awesome.
the ammount of shade towards jk rowling in this vid is outstanding
Im wondering how many people actually know what a dodgy "malaka" means... its a (dodgy) man who bashes his sausage through his fist...
modest pedestrian
It's sad when Modest Pelican is not asking us to stay classy anymore. Feels like one of top 10 anime betrayal.
best ad
Oy cunt love u
When are you getting your own flavor of gg?
his black.....magic is why he runs fast LOL
You ever play Cyberpunk meng?
Is that your squezze, Pappa Pelli ? She looks well hydrated. Good job.
It took me a minute to find this channel cause I started looking for Seagull gaming instead. I am ashamed.
BLACK magic is crazy fast👀
I want an entire playthrough of the game with Peli just casually roasting JK Rowling every now and again.
Too bad the AI is braindead and NPCs are just inanimate objects. This game had much more potential. With NPCs the like of RDR2 this game would have been awesome, now it's honestly not that immersive
Made my day much better watching this. Thanks peli, stay hydrated
If only you could use your wand to hydrate 😡
Mans got that Kony2012 reference 6:45
What happened with the audio at 6:58 ??
Need to put tons of Modest Pelican stickers on a kickball. When the kickball beans the kid in the face, Modest Pelican stickers will stick to his face. Spreading yhe good word of your channel
bro is just getting funnier and funnier
We need more dayz!
Big supporter of JK Rowling and her "hate" towards "marginalized" groups.
you're so funny!!!!!
“I could be reading this wrong but I think she’s DTF” 😂😂😂😂
I’m made my character a white roadman 😂
Papa Smokes GTA episodes are a thought😂
Muggle is not this world's N-word. That would be mud-blood.
Honestly, continually roasting J.K. Rowling is a pretty slick strategy for not getting cancelled.
15,000 people want PS1 Hagrid to take a look under their cloaks...
I haven’t watched any other Hogwarts gameplay. I’ve been waiting for this Modest Pelican is carrying YouTube. ❤
Love the cheeky osrs reference - do a video do a video
Congrats on 2m subs papa. I loved this video
This man has balls of steel to be playing this game.
2:26 lmao
this guys videos give me life
Id honestly go into depression of a scarecrow dabbed on me
I’d just come back from inhaling a stick of devils lettuce and stumbled across the flight lesson. Flying through hogwarts blazed as a bayblade is something else
"Papa Smokes is one fast athletic lad. It'a probably because he's black...magic fascination motivates him to train his cardiovascular health regularly so his brain stays on"
I'm actually contemplating wether or not to buy this. If I buy this will I die a virgin?
“Lack of security” Lmao, all the teachers are literally armed. And so are the students
If only it was multiplayer
One of the best add’s ever 😂😂😂
I love you too Peli
They should have made it like bully, but hogwarts
So it's like Bully but with magic...
dog flying
Oh god, please DONT LEAR AVADA CADAVRA
Did anyone else get that RuneScape reference 😂😂
Made my character look like a peaky blinder TOMMY Who's the new focking Shelby
Uh oh Modest. You're a transphobe now. Damn.
wow, a real woman for real, where did you find one?
Peli’s gurl bad af 🫶🏻
Best HP game since chamber of secrets frfr
Random NPC:Oh hello AVADA KEDAVRA
this could be my fav video of yours
No way your girl is that fiiiiine.      I mean that's great for you. Congratulations and all that yk...
You should throw a brick at a window in hogwarts
i like how you made your char a mongrel just to cover him up as soon as possible. Also the diversity in the game makes me want to vomit , why is there third world migration in wizard geopolitics, god beware if there were only English people in an English wizard academy....
lego harry potter is better
2 mil nice job!
1:26 paid actor
That was definitely the best add I’ve ever seen in a YouTube video 😂😂
2:20 you better have taken a knee after that bro, it's february
My only problem with this game is that the story is kinda boring and you have no choice. You could be evil and try to kill people and nothing changes.
Wait what? All I've been watching these videos for was your accurate reviews on video games.
"Yahoo. Just drink it." ...to stay hydrated!!!
Dont get this game 90 percent pf it is cutscenes i feel like im watching a fcuking movie like ahit let me play the fucking game idc what the story is its fucking harry potter i really just want to fly and explore like wtf
No joke here. Just wanted to say a Peli video is just what I needed on my B-day! You deserve even 20 million subs!
Aye yo pelis gf kind of a baddie
The House Rizzard 😂
I gotta get me some Gamer Supps
fox
2:14 wow take it easy there nuthead!
Man all the references had me laughing thanks again for an amazing video
I came for the comedy, but stayed for the constant dunking on jkr.  Brilliant and congrats on 2m!
Why’d you make your character black?
I’m so mad that you played this game. You’re a bigot. Now I’ll boycott your channel too instead of going outside to boycott Universal (which JK Rowling actually gets more royalties from)
As a huge Harry Potter fan I can confidently say this looks like a below average Ubisoft game.
You're mad funny my g
Do the whole game
The Amy Schumer joke was by far the best joke of the video. Well done! Too bad she'll probably steal it in her next special
It's pretty sad that JK Rowling  is getting so much heat for saying we shouldn't play along with the imaginations of the ill.
best birthday ever pelican uploaded
Ironic how I sparked up before watching this video
The RuneScape joke got me 🤣
The house RIZZard
peli ur girl is fire
2:13 you just shot that dude in the nuts and didnt even notice
mom wake up Modest Pelican posted
Since I'm one of the peasants that will get the game in April, I'm hesistant on all the first HL vids, but I couldn't resist a Peli vid!
The Peaky blinders fit is legendary
SCRECROW HIT THE DAB!?!?!?! 10:13
What I like is the fact you can change appearance on any gear you wear with any piece of gear you previously unlocked my guy looks like a fully pledged death eater.  Edit: there also some added on benefits with some skills like expillarmus can attack swordsman then you can press rb to throw there own weapon at them. Because it's a disarming charm  I use crucio and confringo on spiders xD it's savage. Because I also have the talent for crucio and confringo all attacks deflect on nearby enemies to  Currently lvl 22 I overheard you need to follow Sebastian on the main quest to unlock avada kedavra But I wanna unlock transformation spell with talent turns enemies into explosives objects that can be thrown
I’m dying 😂😂 This was the funniest one yet
I want to see what would happen if he played fallout shelter
Bro the rizz is strong with you
how are they gonna give u a GTA minimap and not let you hijack someone’s broomstick
They should let you go full fallout New Vegas on NPCs lol
IM DYING HERE
Can u plz play red dead
3:31 I love how he tried holding in his laughter😂
Why do you keep grinding JK Rowling into the turf?
I hope Peli casts repairo on his audio recording setup and attitude toward 2m subs wtf
"Women" because "the dark arts" was taken by a 7,000 years old teacher (but let's face it guys - she is still HOT AS F***!). Thank you Papa Peli, for this video of yours helped to raise my desire having a broom stick between my legs, once again.
Greatest 2milly appreciation vid ever
I'm a big fan, so it's sad when you "sell out" to woke nonsense. From what I understand all jkr did was state biological facts.  I may be missing something she said/did, but if not, that's not a reason to hate on her.
they should've made an easter egg on the hut of ps1 hagrid
Congrats on 2m Goated YouTuber Also Don't forget to stay hydrated 👍
i think i still watch his videos for the relaxing voice and background tune
I just realized that Modest Pelican is an anagram for moped tescalin. COINCIDENSE?!?! Yeah, probably.
Thanks for the perfect video mate!!
imma start buying gamer supps after that sponsor
Before watching this video, i went fast to my fridge to get a glass of water, so i could stay hydrated all the time while watching it
You did it again you son of a bird 2:26 had me rolling on the floor. If you had a comedy special I would totally download it illegally.
Wizards are gay.
Your awesome ly funn
“They were there, but were they?”  Perfect analogy of France in WWII 👏🏻
Taking constant shots at Rowling lol u mad?
alternate video title: Shitting On JK Rowling For 11 Minutes
Calls out JK Rowling for hating marginalized groups, and then proceeds to make a joke about black people. 🤗
love you so much peli
A low polygon mirror on ps5? your lying💀
I love your videos keep it up!!
He really does look like an English roadman lol
2:25 😂
1. 0:42 accurate 2. 5:23 imagine if there is some kind of “magic bug” and the stairs no longer work xd 3. 7:34 *this can explain a lot and makes me wonder how a private magic school looks*
is this before harry's time? One of the professors is a Weasley
Petition to cancel this game since it has a severe lack of pelicans
Modest pelican is the biggest bird
what the hell was that bit about his sister's new born😯😯😯
Amazing so ethnically diverse 1700 England was! :)
Quality content
Am african, all i only wish is if i can play thus game one day one time😩
So it requires a joint you say .. got you 👍🏻👌🏻
hello can we play gta im iAndrei404 you are a goat
Pellie being woke was not on my bingo card for 2023. Sad. This video felt like modern day SNL.   RIP pellie. Men cannot be women. Women cannot be men. I bet you’re pro science too? Except for biology.
congrats on 2m
Why does everyone run through the map instead of walking and enjoying the atmosphere?
Best dry humor channel I've come across. 10/10
Here's your GTA 6 😆
Is Pelican pro-mental illness? Would be shocking.
Who else caught that Jake Paul diss? lol
got the trailer for the game as an ad before the video as well
"Another!"
Just realising it’s actually Sallows not Swallows 💀
This is what we've been waiting for
The amount of jokes that were perfect in the video was amazing. Peak Pelli
Deep wilderness pking? I would love you to see playing Runescape!
2:20 you know, I never realized Voldemort attacking Hogwarts is the equivalent to the quiet kid bringing a gun to school.
"Deep wilderness pking." You bastard. I'll never look at the magic the same now.
Throwing a JKR rant every few minutes not to piss of some idiots. Smart move I guess.
Glad this is a channel known for hydration...after that ad...I find myself thirsty...lol
these video always find a way to make me laugh, thank you peli!!
Loving the covert rowling burns, great watch as always.  More sea of thieves please kind sir
Hahahahahaha i dead when he was running and you said probably because he black… magic bla bla brooo I’m dead fr
Wait, was the Gamer Supps ad read featuring your gf?
Nice subtle RuneScape pking reference 😂
Best game review I have seen for this game so far
Plz do more hogwarts legacy videos plz :)
Pretty cool looking game!
Peli sounded like Borat 😂 10:04
Wow, that’s all the empirical evidence I need! Lol
Congrats on the 2m Peli! Keep up the amazing work you're doing man!
That's some classic advertising.
2:50 "The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge." JK "not an egg" Rolling about herself
Cool
this the new rockstar game?
I forget how funny you are
The perfect review
Can't believe Wizards held on to fade technology and didn't share it
The sisters baby burying is soooo true!
JK rowling is just too based to sjw's
OMG man that's the first time in my life that an add made me burst out into howling laughter 😂
unsubscribed because of your comments towards jk rowling. I guess you like supporting pedophiles
imagine if this game (or another like this) was an MMO and all the players were students that would be awesome!!
Bro got beef with jk. Rowling
L game fr
I usually really like your videos, and this one was in general quite funny as well, but the unnecessary roasts of JK Rowling makes me sad, as it shows that lots of people hate her because of what media says instead of  checking what she actually said. A little bit of research would really help as she doesn’t hate on anyone but just points out potential dangers of a new law in Scotland.  Besides that congrats on 2m subscribers and keep up the good content! :)
10:00 I think we all knew what was going on
lmao
Promising review of the game. Best one i've seen so far
2:29 ayooo!
I’m sold on gamer supps, masterful advertising
What happened to my boi... he turned from a Moisture Munching Malaka to a Sups Sipping Soyboy🥺
Best Gamersupps plug ever.
The amount of jk Rowling shade is amazing
This video is so good that I drank I glass of water in support
Nah you can only be drinking water , stay hydrated
The notification of this video being published made my day ❤
Why are mirrors so bad in video games
If you're interested in Twitch Highlights you could watch my latest video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OnR-n_tAOk
the amy schumer one was nice
"A lady in the streets, Hagrid in the sheets" had me rolling.
That quidditch dlc joke was tooo accurate loooool 😂
9:20 this is how the mainstream media see gamers
I feel left out
"burry him in some soil" boi what da hell
Probably his(hes) black …….magic fascination.-Modest Pelican.    I agree either way.
“Lady in the streets, Hagrid in the sheets” 😆
love u peli
I’m here for the trans phone comments
Papa peli do you want to play gta online and hydrate all the tryhards?
It’s not an Modest Pelican video without making fun of Amy Schumer
Nothing feels better than hearing papa Peli's voice
“Muggles the Wizarding world’s n-word “😂
Half of this was bullying J.K Rowling and I loved it
Stay hydrated peli
but can you use ice barrage with your clanmates to PK a lured wizard in deep wildy?
This is hilarious 😂
no quiditch this year because the DLC isnt going to sell itself 😂
so far i have skipped "ALL" possible dialoge i could..    :D
Please stop with the J.K "jokes", this whole uproar is so ridicilous. It's not like she had anything to do with making the game.
why has everyone forgotten the truist harry potter game to exist lego harry potter
i just hope it gets mods
Pls more
You can actually kill everyone with mods
Unsubbed for the gamersupps shit ngl your drink water joke was funny and healthy not shoving dogshit sugar water onto an impressionable child audience with anime tits to compliment their crippling social autism
is gamer supa what?
Someone needs to make a milk crate climbing simulator.
Too many mudloods in the game. Niqs. Racial purity was upmost and rats like that would never been in such a world. Unless the game was made by an sjw company to train your kid to race mix and chop their meat off. Oh wait....
0/10 game no thicc hermione 10/10 video
I just spread the good word of your channel to my older brother through this video. He seems to think you are “un-ironically funny”, wich is a statement I feel everyone here agrees with. Now I’m going to paint a brick with the modest pelican logo and throw it through the nearest children’s hospital to further spread the good word of your channel.
So stoked to see you do a video on this, 2 million subs are well deserved
Thank you for being you and not jumping on the wagon of bs/negativity going around this atm. 2/3 of all legacy vids either 100% focusing on the negativity or are infomercials about how to avidi kidivi and its really annoying. I can only tell ytube "I'm not interested" in legacy vids so much til the algorithm jus takes them all away but the other 1/3 of vids are just semi-decent playthroughs. Great vid sry for the rant
2:26 L...O.....L 😆
2:26 L...O.....L 😆
How did the in-video ad make this video better?
If dat ur gyaldem in the gamer supps ad she proper leng u kno
how dare you calling Sebastian for gryffindor
6:26 wait, so you can just go invisible, sans cloak? Seems op
No but honestly what did jk rowling literally say?
The woke mob doesn't watch your videos
Nah Jk. Rowling is fine she actually spits facts
The fucking add 😂😂😂
Geof. I miss the "... as this really helps spread the good word of my channel." Intros. Please bring them back!
This game, but on edibles 😵‍💫😵‍💫
YoURe TraNSPhoBic
Muggle isn’t the “wizard world’s n-word”, it’s “mudblood” which isn’t even for non-wizards it’s for wizards who are half human you twat
Congrats on having a baby with your sister!
First vid I've seen, hilarious!
The wordplay, och 😂
riskiest vid 💀
Based
Mr pelican you are funny
WE WANT MORE DAYZ VIDEOS!
I havent seen pelican before but he looks exactly how he sounds
Cool, looks fun peli.
Love you sooo much for the Amy Schumer roast, fuck that bitch!
“Gandalf the every color equally” was really destined for greatness. To bad the faculty sent him back to Los Santos 😭
Yoooo, love your vids❤️
This is hilarious, as always. Just a quick reminder that... https://youtu.be/T3wcxHiorJ4
This video is amazing. How can I subscribe again? 😂
Can’t believe Peli only has 2M subs
broooo this man taking shots at everyone
Maybe there will be a full GTA mode mod soon enough.
Hogwarts School of Poverty 😂 I’ve missed watching your videos Pelican.
im the fast
you healed my depression, love you papi
Pogwars
JK Rowling deserves the heat, but not for saying the truth that men can’t be women and women can’t be men 😂
Bring the tree dead back
Jesus she is fine.
your pc is burning
fans trobe
I told everybody in my class with HIPPO that were spreading the good word of ur channel and told them to subscribe even my teacher isn’t that right HIPPO
Did u know modest pelicans are way more modest then modest owls
"I better stop talking about girls balls or JK Rowling will send me a cease and desist letter" 💀
This is how you do it. Play the game while constantly making fun of JKR :)
Oof the “deep wilderness pking” line got me
I will call my self Thick and my broom Long so when we play Quidich we will keep the seats hydrated
best video in a hot minute haha
First and hopefully only dislike on a Peli video. Would have loved this video without the JK drama.
you look like johnny sins
I laught so hard out loud that everybody started staring at me around me... maybe I should've waited til after my mothers funeral to watch this... but no, modest pelican videos can't wait
Pelican gone woke
how much did you pay her xd
sparking up a what..?
my hog has warts
i lovd thise game so much
Hi lads and lasses Modest Pelican here with ____, if you enjoyed the video then please tweet something in favor of Hogwarts Legacy and mention that you saw Modest Pelican play it, as this really spreads the good word of my channel.
HAHA "he is fast its probably cuz, his(he's) black... magic fascination..."
I'm a Ravenclaw and french... I don't know how to feel...
Never been into HP but this looks kinda fire.
Deserved every one of them you dodgy malaka
Get ready for seething alphabet people
Modest Pelican and Callmekevin are so alike i sometimes forget who im watching i love it
Peli made his sister to be in the gamer juice ads. Smart fella
No helicopter shot down in the thumbnail ☹️
absolutely brilliant, Peli. has me in stitches. you're welcome on the 2m.
Deep wild pking video when ?  :D
Awesome!!  It's great to see normal people standing up against the ltbg+p Twitter mobs.   Definitely subscribing and becoming a member.
Papa smokes doesn’t only pull objects towards him he also pulls women
"The Playstation 1 Harry Potter was better tho"  I paused the video and left a like the moment I stopped laughing.  Pelli Knows what's up
Congratulations to your sister
All are entitled to their opinion unquestionably for me personally though the jk Rowling jokes were too much and ruined the usual fun in your videos :/ All the best anyways
Peli that line you said killed me she showed me not to die a virgin 😂😂😂
"UGH!  No, please not this fucking wizard game"  *Constantly dunks on JoKeRowling*  Ok, I found some level of entertainment in this.  Girls balls best balls.
HALF BLOOD EVERYWHERE LMAO
Great video 😂
2mil is HUGE!! Congrats dude
You know this guy is funny but throwing in the woke crap just to not get canceled is honestly very sad
Seven life-sucking-knee-biters AND a wife?!? Who did you piss off, exactly?!
Is this Bully 2?!
wtf was that gamer supp-__- btw stay hydrated
I forgot how much you mke me laugh
The best spell help you stay hydrated
It's because he's black.... magic etc etc. I see what you did there 😂
OH GOD! YOU MENTION THE GAME THAT MUST NOT BE MENTIONED! Genocide to commence immediately....
immediate like for the runescape joke lmfao
Water
wemmen
Reparo does legit sound like a name of an Aussie guy that you go to to fix shit
2:29 trueeee
I thought mudblood was the 'N' word of the magic world
"Lady in the streets, Hagrid in the sheets."  🤣
Goes onto the path to become a professor, then teach transmogrification class and turn all everyone into a pelican or a water goblet to help spread the good word of your channel.
i love this guy lol
Most normal school in Ohio💀
If by "hate" you mean "saying the obvious truth", I agree!
Im not getting gamer supps unless there is water flavour Stay hydrated kids
How many JK Rowling jokes do you want? Peli:YES
A perfect demonstration of separating art from artist, bravo
Congrats papa pelican
2:26 - 2:35 - underrated joke with masterful delivery 😅
Smoking a joint and playing any game is worth while ✌️💨
youre a wizard, peli
2 million hydrated people ,thats an achievement
If she can fight off dementia she can do anything 😂😂💀💀
Sex and gender are not that straightforward. Make two lists. One for male traits and one for female traits. (Gonads, hormones, chromosomes, gymnastics etc. The lists gets long) There will be persons that don't fit neatly in either column and will feel a more ore les strong disconnect. Others might be completely blindsided by a blood test or biopsy.   *_But gender reassignment surgery etc is not for every one!_*   Sex and gender are not that straightforward, that's what I'm saying.   ...anyway, remember to: "Be good to one another or fock off." The Gospel according to Thomas Doubting 1:1
Ur vids are the best pls respond
2:30 Lmao
Amyl and the sniffers must be really proud of papa peli
absolutely the best non-political purely game focused review i've seen about this game."the headmaster said no quiditch cause dlc wont sell itself"  magnificently funny as usual
I am really excited to continue fighting all these goblins who are DEFINITELY NOT Jewish people.
do  a  escape tarkov  video
Man successfully plays hogwarts legacy without his girlfriend crying.
Congrats on hitting 2 million subs! You earned it man!
HA!❗️ That Grifindor kid will die a Virgin for sure, after that blast! 💥  ...🤔 that dipends on the spell...right? Was that a "inni-outi" spel⁉️ 2:14
2:23 😂😂
That Amy Schumer joke made me chuckle
Will our beloved Agent 47 attend Hogwarts in the future?
Yes! More Please...
time to duplicate water using spells
Yes
Love you papa peli
Yes.
Modest pelican you should really follow sebastions side quest line its worth it
Lego Harry Potter was better as there was a water spell allowing u to hydrate the good people of Hogwarts
The Rowling jokes hit perfect. It's so fun to slander women in defense of grown dudes who wanna chill in the girl's restroom.
Bro this guy makes games look so entertaining
Pelican sure loves the thought of violence for this game.
voldemort aint gonna see the pelicans coming
I love when this aquatic Bird posts
38 minutes ago and 312th
Basically a magic-focused Elden Ring with 1/3rd the difficulty.
Modest Pelican!!! I love your content!!!!
ngl peli should make a ufc 3 vid
Proud to be one of your 2 million subs🔥
Was shocked by the sudden modest pelican appearance, never seen him in RL view before
we need hydration spells.
Nice of your sister do to that commercial for you
The Jk jokes were so good 😂
Papa Peli is my main motivation for staying hydrated.
Alternative title: how many times can I insult j k Rowling
“Well played JK Rowling, you woman!”   My man’s up to speed😂  EDIT: this whole vid seems to be a sneaky JK Rowling rant 😅
The house Rizzard
Hell yeah!
Lost a lot of respect for you after this upload. You should of knowed better. Unsubscribed
i wish the common rooms were more important. they're literally empty at night, all the students just disappear!
The burns.... I love them
Can you please do a hitman video or the new freelancer mode I would really appreciate or a mafia video for mafia 3
cause dlc isnt going to sell its self....alright that that was good
The one-liners in this one have been top notch
Why is jk Rowling catching so many uneccesary strays from you of all people don't tell me your one of the twitards  ... She said nothing but facts
I dunno what this Harry Potter game is like but I definitely agree with JK Rowling’s views on gender.
Lego did it better 20 years ago.
Hilarious vid
m
I dont have anything against muggles, infact  some of my best servants are muggles... wait that came out wrong. Anyway I just dont think Wizards like us should drink from the same fountains as muggles is all.
No crazy malakas in Hogwarts Legacy it seems
4:52-4:55 love the Runescape reference! And silly me was thinking there was no way you could be any better
We hit 2mill yaa congs
All the NSFW jokes had me Rowling on the floor
"because I have the emotional security of JK Rowling"  This. Was was brilliant. I'm rolling on the fcking floor.   Ps: I can't believe yall are such transphobe people, I'm literally shaking and crying right now. I'm will now play video games about a genetically engineered super killer like the morally superior person I am 😤
He wasn't joking with that gamersupps ad I had some and then I became a level 100 boss thanks a lot Modest Pelican.😛
In an effort to spread the good word of this channel I recently told a friend about Modest Pelican. He said he'd never heard of him, so I did what needed to be done and slit the big gurl's throat. While that doesn't help the sub count, I feel like he had it coming.
You should start an advertising company.  That product segment was like a haiku.
take a shot when you hear a jk rowling joke
Veni Vidi Vici Video game Peli
Bruh I ordered nearly 130 worth of gamer supps 3 days ago. 😂
Harry Potter wasn’t in it because he was hydrating
Hey, if you support child labour, you might wanna go to the USA, they're slowly legalizing it, you could be instrumental for those changes to actually happen.
Pretty sure Mudblood is the wizarding world N word lol
Part 2?
I must not be hydrated enough since I thought the dueling guy was Gryffindor
Modest pelican made him look like the mafia guy
amazing video peli now i can sleep in peace
bad game nobody drinks water
Your videos always keep my hydrated.
2:25 made me fall out of my chair
Congrats on 2 MIL!
Got any copyright strike from nike?
When u run around fixing things. It not considered child labor because you’re not getting paid for it hehehe lol
I'll never get a reply from the great  peli 😔, guess I'll have to drown in god's nectar
"ladies in the street, hagrid in the sheets" lmaoo
I eat ham
Congrats on the 2 mill Papa Peli! Stay hydrated!
you better play more of this
I love watching the left eat the left for not being left enough, papa pelican's political undertones are  as well hidden in this as men in female sports.
This shit is LIT!
This game with drive-by s would be game of the generation
fucking love this way
I think its actually not possible to conjour food in the HP Universe, so no sandwich for kids. Also was that nudge at ps1 hagrid a dig at CallmeKevin? XD
isn't that nik-
Tried gamersupps, mid at best
This is the damn funniest thing I've seen i n my life
Go to hogwards and hold everyone hostage until they all subscribe to modest pelican
w modest pelican
You forgot to put #ad
What an absolute boi of bois.  Big congrats on 2m you dodgy malaka!
PS1 Hagrid ❤
just orded some gamersupps, already got 5 more ladys in my dm's. apporoved ✔
Peli's jabs at current events are unmatched🤣
Modest Pelican about to teach the Wizarding World that a Pelian is scarier than a Snake.
I’ve never seen the movies and the game is so well done. Idc about Harry Potter and it’s still got me hooked so bad. Slitherin Gang
I really am early
All we need now is a Bully 2 but with a cyberpunk setting and magic.
2:29 YOU ARE A RA -  dical madlad for making that joke
here in the first 10 mins
Peli is the type of guy he swears he’s clean to only give you hogwarts
LETS GOO IM EARLY
I feel like this game looks kinda empty
Peli can we get a series on this game?
Deep wilderness pking lool
@ModestPelican you are gay
I love ur videos
Make sure to not get cancelled!
3:41 that roast is genius
Friendly reminder that JK Rowling did nothing wrong
I love you man! What amazing content. I stopped feeding my baby formula and went straight to water so that the little malaka is hydrated.
Honestly it's an extremely beautiful game
This is art
Papa Smokes, is that a reference to Big Smoke or your dad leaving to get a pack of smokes and didn't come back?
Sounds like you have a thing for guys that wear women costumes with all those JK digs
The only playthrough of this game I needed to see
YRSSS I LOVE THIS GAME PLS MAKE MORE PARTSSS
Pelican is a transphope I can't believe my eyes.
show us Tony please,my family is held hostage until you show it
Congratulations on 2 million! You’re one of the best YouTubers I’ve seen! Congratulations and keep it up!
Lmfao idk why but it’s hilarious that you made a black student ! 🤣
sup;)
So is Potion Class also coming as a DLC 🥱
I bet J.K Rowling doesn.t even cosume enough water.
Spina bifidus correctus i think it is 😁
This man heals my soul
The hits on jkr were a bit uncalled for
Jesus christ enough with the "jk Rowling hates Trans people but I don't support that" bs, grow a pair. I've always enjoyed ur videos and I'm still going to enjoy ur videos in the future but seriously u don't have to say it ,we know. Noone thinks u hate Trans people bc u played this game
Congratulations on the 2mil Papa Peli 🍻💫🥳
Bro really kidnapped a real girl so he could advertise gamer subs, as it really did spread a good word of his channel
How dare you make a video while I’m at church
Fun fact, Pelicans can swim. Making them one of the most hydrated birds in the world
Marvelous!
Nice
can i know who the women was
Jk Rowling is right tho
Hogwaters Legacy
Suffer not the witch to live. We of the Inquisition formally request multiplayer be added as soon as it’s out of beta testing.
Dude 💀 said that to his dark arts teacher.
"If she can fight off dementia she can fight off anything" 😭😭😭
Thanks for all the great vids daddy Peli congrats on 2 million people being hydrated
I need to get me some gamer supps 😂
another banger
not this terf supporting game.. 🤮
I guess I gotta drink gamer supps to rizz up those raven claw baddies
,,Gamer Supps, just do it‘‘ that slogan sounds familiar ngl
that black magic joke killed me
5:38 💀 business minded headmaster stonks 📈
2:30 ayooo 😂
Well done on a great video big girl
It’s incredible that you’ve saved 2 million people from dying of thirst. Also, this game has nothing on Lego Harry Potter
2:27😭
Papa Smokes will truly be a worthy opponent for Voldemort
Papa Pelican I love u 🫶
I thought that he would choose Slytherin
pelican
98th
Gotta be the best Gamer Supps ad I've ever seen
Did you know that the wizarding world has switched from using owls to using pelicans? This is because pelicans are far superior at keeping the population Hydrated and spreading the good word of modest pelicans channel
crazy theres already this many comments when the video was posted literally a minute ago
