You had a great handwriting as a kid I still have horrible handwriting
1:30 Me and my older brother did the exact same thing after mom scolded us for something. We even went out of the front gate but instead of running away we spent the entire time peeking through the gate until mom comes to take us inside. Well, that didn't happen so we went back inside by ourselves 😂
Had had a dragon faze that started having a dragon obsession in the 3rd grade and never stoped, and I never got called a furry by anyone because I started said obsession from 3rd grade, however middle school was a different story, but it has stoped since thankfully. (I got nothing against furrys I just don’t wish to label myself as one)
I was in a… IKEA ALIEN PHASE:3

Why do you have a apple jack pony?

0:50 the pony is apple jack
WHY DO YOU CALL US OODLOLIES
I almost ran away
Na, i don't think its a phase. I'm just tired and endless school infront of me makes me lose hope. People might say " If other people can go through it, so can you" but its not like that. Its not that i have a bad life, in fact my life is good. I have good parents and good friends, but there's just something missing in my life. Like i dont fit in here and that i should just disappear and be someone else. I have considered running away multiple times over the years but i havent gotten myself to do it. I used to believe in god but now i dont even believe in anything. Simply just going to school is much draining than people say. I think of it as a video game, you go to school and instantly take poison damage over the day and when you return home and play video games, you heal slowly. But you can't heal fully, so you return to school the next day with damage already taken, and over time that really makes a difference. At this point there's nothing more i want than everybody i know to forget me and for me to simply disappear.
Do I wait for it to hatch
I've been in a Wicked phase 4 a year
The way that your mom joins is just crazy
I had a Pokemon phase for 2 YEARS

Guys if you wanted to know what the letter said I will tell you!  "Dear mom and dad, I ran away from home to find my own life. I will build my own house and find my own food. I will get a job and get some money. Don't worry about putting up signs saying you seen me. I will come visit you and you can come visit me. I will tell you my address when I find it."       "Love Rebecca"
I did this too 😂 1:23
Hey, I just wanna tell you let me explain Studios. You’re the best YouTuber I ever seen better than el cartoons
Wait 7:39 did you bite a piece of cake even though you don't have a mouth 👄
the only time i successfully 'ran away' was when my amaw lived next door and i didnt want to sleep over there after i'd been sent over by my parents, so in all my genius i left in the middle of the night, banged on the back door until my dad let me in, and happily crawled into my bed. Also, I apparently never grew out of this bc i still love leaving in the middle of the night, only now i can drive this time.
I want to do the joke on. My mom.
Pokemon gotta catch em all

Ha ha you got tricked
Fun fact, I actually kind of “ran away“ a couple times throughout my childhood once I was just mad at my mom because she had grounded me so I left her a pissy note calling her a jerk and then I ran off to my grandfather‘s house my original plan that day was to runoff to my grandmother‘s apartment, but she was at my grandfather‘s house doing laundry And then another time I didn’t properly run away so to say, but basically my mom and her boyfriend, a.k.a. my stepdad were arguing and we were supposed to be going off to a trip to Canada for a bit, but some stuff was going on and I just wanted to get a break from them yelling at each other or them just arguing in general and I went for a little walk down to the duck pond down by my house, although I did not have my phone on me or my smart watch so I did scare the crap out of my mom only for her to find me sitting at the duck pond just chilling. She was fallen crying when she picked me up and I felt so bad and I’ve never done it ever since.
I’m hungy
I went through a dinosaur phase. And at 13 years old I still haven't left it. I am still fascinated by dinosaurs and love drawing them.

I had a hello kitty obsession when I was younger like my entire room had hello kitty stuff
When I was in 2nd grade I tried to run away. I didn't even make it to the end of the road.
One time when I was about like six or seven, I ran away and my mom pulled the Ramona trick where she put exercise weight in my bag, and I obviously did not fall for it because I have read Ramona many times as a six-year-old, but in the end, I said, I decided that runaway because I was going with afriend to a summer camp so I didn’t want to miss that😂
Also, I’m the big sister (I’m actually in the middle child that I’ve step siblings so I don’t know if that counts) and I am usually the one causing trouble😅
I’m a geek entertainer what about y’all?
I have ran away from home when I was 3 i think, i was in Norway (I'm Lithuanian). I ran to a playground.

6:25 7:35 Let Me Explain Studeos lore?
Whenever I was a kid, I went away. Also it was whenever my grandma was babysitting me because my mom and dad went to work and there was no one else at the house except for my sister and my grandma which was babysitting me so she told me that she was going to the bathroom. And I was a kid I was a weird iPad kid just like you were like weird iPad kid so I was on my iPad and then I forgot that she told me that she was going to go back and I thought that she was lost and of course I never go to my sister because she is so annoying so I will have away and look for her so I was dumb one time I asked and then I asked a stranger. My grandma was babysitting me and then I told him that the whole entire story and then I saw her talking to our neighbor whatever we got closer to our house asking where he was and then I got in trouble in class whenever my grandma called my parents and told him so that’s my story and how I went away
0:52 “but mom it’s not a phase!“ famous last words
U must have great memory to remember this meny childhood stories
mom;omg come HERE BECCA

i went through this phase. i actually did it, though. i don’t remember this vividly, but my parents did. i ran up the street and my dad ran after me and apparently i got all the way (or some of the way) up the street. several times i went outside to adventure.
For some reason I'm an overly happy person and it's as hard as trying to break steal to make me cry, and for some reason I got a depressed phase😂 I would ask my friend "do you care about me?" And I went back to happy
How does her background look better than herself?

2:47 I was expecting her to say: “and thus here comes the previously mentioned “kid logic”.
Oh my God I did that before and let me tell you the story: so I got in trouble because I drew on the wall when I was like 5 years old and I got a plastic bag and put snacks my pillow and my blanket and I brought a box and a coats and other stuff and I open the garage door after I had an argument with my parents I do not like that at all then I decided to go out without permission and I almost got adopted and my parents killed me after that I went to having an argument to almost leaving my family to being and punishment for 3 weeks it was not worth anything

I saw one of the trees and wanted the trees was a butt😂😂😂 0:16
“It’s not my problem to figure out how to get 426 pumpkins out here!” What is becca doing with 426 pumkins?
Becca’s Dad: *dramatic monologuing* His urge to go to the bathroom: *im* *boutta* *end* *this* *kid’s* *hiding* *career.*

Go on my trampoline. Listen to music every day without my parents being there for me because I am more mature then you’re a kid Becca.
Omg your dad is kk
Your videos never fail to make me laugh 🤣🤣🤣🤣
2:05 The thing about that. It might seem oppressive to kids who have never seen the ugliness of the human nature, but there's a reason. 😆 If you ever have kids you'll understand why your parents didn't want you walking alone (especially when it was getting dark).
Alternate title Rebecca’s Dad gets Punked

Hello YouTube 😂
I been watching this since 2020 and it's still cool 😎
5:59 i love the undertale reference
She left her things while she left!
The grinch face! 😶
Reminds me of one time I got lost in an amusement park. There was a big enclosed attraction where you can fire foam balls at people. Like there were all sorts of little airsoft turrets and sling shots set up and you just run around shooting each other. I went in with my dad and maybe one or some of my siblings (I honestly don't remember). For whatever reason, I decided it'd be a brilliant idea to go exploring, so I snuck away from my dad and left the attraction. I got outside, checked out the pretty flowers in this raised garden patch, and figured I should go back in and find him. I walked back into the attraction through the exit, glanced around at this big room with a bunch of colorful balls flying everywhere, and couldn't see him. So small-child-me concluded he must have already left. In a panic, I left the attraction again and circled it to see if I could find him. Nope. Nothing. At that point, I sat on the stone fence that lined the flower beds outside the attraction and just started sobbing. It was only then that a park employee appeared and asked me where my parents were. When I told them I didn't know, they then asked the very logical question "What's your parents' names?" so that they could call them on the intercom. I remember this bit vividly. Between tears, I told this employee, "I'm not allowed to say my mom's name but my dad's name is [full name]." So then the employee calls my dad on the intercom, and it turned out he was still inside the attraction all along and I'd missed him. He was confused, my mom showed up also confused, and I was mega embarrassed but relieved to be back with them. To this day, I have no idea how I was even able to sneak away like that. You'd think an employee would be watching the exit to the attraction and would've spotted me trying to leave, but no. Didn't happen.
Bro I’m stuck in my space phase lol.
7:21 Becca let’s be honest here every single family of God‘s earth messes with each other I mean I messed with my dad when he was outside doing yardwork by locking the door to the laundry room and the back room but it turd when I am outside he does the same to me (but now I can’t do that anymore since my dad passed because both of my mom and my brother hate it😞)

So I know I'm two years late and no one is going to see this unless they're craving content or just wanted to browse this channel but I think my running away story is kinda funny! So when I was a kid I tried to run away a LOT like it was sad. Heck when I got older it made me get scared to leave my parents side. But the funny thing was that my Mom was probably colder cuz she would just pack my little bag and put it in the back yard and ok leave I think the furthest I got was to the edge of our coalsack before it got to real and went home to go sit in my room. But the first time I decided I was going to run away was on a summer day. I was grounded and I don't really remember the reason but the younger me thought it was so wrong and unfair I should just go live with my Mema (my grandma if you were wondering), also took me about 30 minutes or so to decide never got better if anything got worse, so with teary eyes I went to my mother and said "I don't want to live here I want to run away and live with Mema." ( Side note it took us like 2 hours to get there with our car but because we drove to that town so much it never felt that long like now it feels like 30 minutes but young me didn't know that) "ok  how are you going to get there" my mom said "walking" then my mom picked up the phone call my bio dad and said "Your kid doesn't want to be your kid anymore." Also they are divorced in the story heck now we don't talk to that idiot but he definitely was very confused and so I told him now crying that I didn't want to live here any more and I want to go live with Mema. I don't really remember what happened after that I think it was a meltdown with a lot of words but after that every summer we would go to our Memas house for the week and stay at our bio dads place for the weekend. I think but at the end of that my mom realized that we need a break from each other (by that I mean my sisters and just a little break) it kinda became a little tradition funny enough. That just shows that sometimes you need to break to heal more than that wound or it's just a funny story I'm just a random person commenting on a pretty old vid cuz I got nothing else to do and felt like talking to the void for a sec before I go watch some more old vids on this channel. I'm surprised if anyone will read or find this but if you did. Hi uh thanks idk what you doing here? Uh bye!!!❤
Rebecca, I think I have adhd
My fase was a HARRY POTTER FASE😂😂😂
I ran away for 5 minutes and my grandmother was so mad
One day I my mom didn’t give me what I wanted so I said I was going to runaway
Jaiden: the great good child  Rebecca: the MOST CHAOTIC CREATURE ON EARTH
In year 6 (we have years not grades in my country) I was also a weird kid I was very silent (I’m a year 8 now and I’m kinda talkative but not really) and when I was year 6 I was so so SO into being trapped in my own dream and Weirdcore and dreamcore (im into Video games like FNF FNAF Undertale  Deltarune Yandere Simulator Roblox and more:’))

You: (As a Kid) I was WEIRD, not STUPID!   I've been bingeing your videos for like 20 minutes now, & I beg to say that the evidence you've presented yourself proves conclusively the error of that statement...

Did Becca ever finish that cake?
I can't believe i just find this video that i watches years ago.... Date: 2024-2025
Right now I’m in my childhood roly poly and millipede phase and I don’t think I SHALL NEVER LEAVE THIS PHASE TOO FUN
Youtube you're going to be my favorite app and anyway i'm going to account
𝕎𝕙𝕒𝕥 𝕥𝕙𝕖
7:05 okay but your note if not written by you, as in like a kid who would play pretend and fake runs away, it's pretty convincing, tell someone a troubled teen wrote this and I guarantee that it would be believable
When you said "bring me home to a angry set of parents" YOUR PARENTS WERE DOING THE MICHEAL JACKSON TILT
"We never stop having phases" When we don't have a phase,  It is a "stop having phases phase"
4:17 she’s a mean one Mrs mom
2:41 me like
Cool
4:20 The Grinch
So, When I Was 13, I Also Had Thoughts About Running Away From Home. I Lived With My Very Manipulative And Toxic Little Brother That Always Wanted Me To Work 24/7 And My Better But Slightly Worse Older Brother, And One Day, My Grandma Called To Check Up On Me, And I Told Her That I Wanted To Run Away From Home Because Of How Abusive My Little Brother Was And How It Got To A Point Where I Felt Like I Was Being Blackmailed Because Of Something Bad I Did 5 Or Something Years Ago, And I Told Her Not To Tell My Mom, And She Said Okay… But 2 Days Later, I Found Out That My Grandma That “Always Kept Secrets With Me” Told My Mom, And She Looked Disappointed In Me, And Said That If I Said That Again, I Would Go To The Hospital. I Didnt Get Grounded Though.
😂😂😂
Hey Beeca! I saw in your note that we spell our names the same way! -Rebecca🩵
Hahahah
I think the only phase that everyone is probably going through right now is the “Video Game Phase”
1966 Grinch Reference!
I'm gonna go in 3rd grade summer school And 3rd grade to 3rd grade Second grade
I have a phase every two months;)
I liked my own comment
Bruh you are so 😂😂😂😂 to me
POV every kid be like when Mom scolded me for doing something wrong. BTW I love your voice when you sing and I love your channel so much!!!
I actually ran away but I was found
4:20 this face is not the same without a mouth, but stills ok
7:02 if anyone is wondering what the letter says, “Dear Mom and Dad, I ran away from home to find my own life. I will build my own house and find my own food. I will find a job and get some money. Don’t worry about me and put up signs that say have you seen me. I will come and visit you. You can come and visit me too. I will give you my address when I find it. Love, Rebecca P.S. I love you I love you I love you I love you and I will miss you. Bye!” yw !!!
My phase was a game one 🎮
i never tried to run away as a kid but in preschool I went into this phase where I stopped wanting to share a room with my older sister so I would get all my stuff into my older brother's room and pretend to share a room with my brother till I lost interest or went to bed in me and my sister's room and forgot about it
I love you're videos 😊😊😊😊
I was the space face and the dinosaur face
Even though they only think on the mom's face a pair of eyes, when she did the Grinch thing, you could read her expression perfectly 😂
Hi™️
No oh god my little pony
You're a great singer, what song was that? 0:06
Melhor vídeo do canal kkkkkk
I just wish @ryanrahman would just run away instead of just being mean to other kids you see. He was a massive bully in primary school. And I wish his teeth would be like that, two yellow and one green Is there any solution to that Rebecca Parham?
Cat wolves
I noticed that all the picnic stuff was supposed to be a rainbow
6:01 just realized this, Kid Becca’s hands are backwards in this scene-

Rebecca will you be in my new show since you have a YouTube channel?
First amazing video to what song were you singing in the intro
Right now I am in my Harry Potter phase.
Hate cats

"Dinosaur phase, pony phase, space phase" - look, I'm still in two of those three and neither of them have anything to do with thunder lizards.

4:17 grinch
When i was an kid i was collecting alive bugs Meanwhile me rn: ROOM FULL OF SPIDERS SKINS AND BUGS IN AMBER AND ALSO ALIVE GIANT AFRICAN SNAIL  yep they call me crazy tho
I remembered when me and my sister wanted to run away (for actual family issue reasons) we'd take a black bag , some of our clothes , our favorite toys and some canned foods with us before making it out of the house.   We made it about two streets away from home when we felt the dread of the punishment that we'd get from our Step dad. So we made it home in fear and tears.
6:48 the fact that 3rd grade Rebecca has better handwriting then me-
Hrb
All the YouTubers gathering on this one boys 🔥
yeah becca i have the same six love in my family and i enjoy it to
Im in my sace age
As a normal viewer I constantly wonder what her family actually looks like? When I see the in her videos so beca what do they look like my brain is stuck with that thought in till them
YOUTUBE!?
LOVE YOUR VIDS ❤
Ohh Becca what are you doing in my soup
I'm gown to be a animator wen I I'm a grown up.
Toootls
A phase I had was collecting stickers that I would go on to never use
2:34 I still walk home and have the place 1 to 2 hours with my sis to this day
LoL
i have a gusher phase
I had a space phase, A pony phase, A animation Phase, A fnaf phase, An Art phase. and now im in the pony phase agian ;-;
You’re wrong parents are fun al the time

Why were you running away
amazing singing!!!!
0:47 i got a chipmunks on 16 speed phase
When i was six my mom didnt take me to the movies.so i cried and sad im running away.btw i love your vids
6:17 Think Rebecca and her dad actually made those sounds when he found her?   Also, Rebecca’s dad’s yell sounds like the bloody meme-y zombie roars from CoD… unless if that was the point. 😂
I love how kid beccas pigtails curve up like demon horns
0:21  i was actually wondering what you were singing…
I'm afraid you have misunderstood the role of an older sibling. We are not always given the divine task of providing instruction, but guiding on the path less trodden.
You make my day ❤️
A fact the first video I ever watched what I mean was was the teeth video I was in my bed at my grandmas I was bored so I was planning to go to Shana watch address or do you like I’m pretty sure but that time I watched it you all mine till I fell asleep 1:34
I’m still a kid I still think somewhere I’m still watching our videos I’m a weird kid so that I don’t make anything out of the ordinary box I’m out of the ordinary
I never escaped my dinosaur phase. It just got stronger and stronger for me as dinosaurs just go a million times more beautiful and interesting for me. And now, birds are my favourite living animals because of them. Because birds straight up ARE dinosaurs! Like... literally on the cellular and biological level, they are straight-up dinosaurs! They are the living dinosaurs, not crocodilians, those are archosaurs and cold-blooded. Dinosaurs were warm blooded.
Rachel is like the worst big sister ever 😂
I bet some animal at the end was like, "Hey! Free food!"
Me and my bff always watch you! She loves your channel.
When your mom said:let's get your dad thunder struck.
Me walking and seeing kids PLAYING IN A PARKING LOT WITH NO ADULTS.
OK so basically my face by the way I'm still kidding my face right now is a tears of a Kingdom phase One of the new Zelda games he he
Not me seeing the scene wear Rachel and her mom get Oscar's while watching the Oscar's
I still i have a drawing phase dont judge
I think your sister is my neighbor
Hey YouTube : NM Studio Productions (formally) 😅
I'm gonna say this but half of my life experience is yours!😂😂even know I'm a dude!!😂😂😂🤓🤓🤓
4:12 grinch reference
For me it was cartoons.
"I was wierd not stupid" best line every
But today I am actually running away because I have nothing to live for and I don't deserve anything so seeya
I had a CAR faze
Lets give a reward to the mother and Rachel a reward for there best worried face
I’m going through my Batman phase

Finally isolate the new Disney commercial
I guess we know now where Rebecca, as a kid devil pigtails came from
Okay, but I kinda also had this phase lol. I remember packing things into this tiny suitcase I owned and walking into my backyard, and then just kinda playing there. It wasn’t running away, more like going on vacation
you can tell which parent rebeccas sister got her acting skills from
"i will give you my address when i find it" 💀💀
I was always scared of the movie Corpse Bride and Nightmare Before Christmas, their now my favourites.
Is that a apple jack toy from my little pony
I am a 9 year old using my tablet and I am extremely weird and I’m a girl. I love my pets and the show Amphibia

426 pumpkins?
I’m in my cooking phase again
I don't think she is running away she is just going for a picnic...knew it
I also had a phase where running awat sounded fun. Nothing wrong with my home life, but kids just crave independence and excitement.  I got stopped in my tracks pretty quickly once I realize that my bunk bed wouldn't fit in my kerchief and I wouldn't be able to lift it. I didn't want to rough it on the ground!
MY LITTLE PONYYYYY🎉🎉
When I was 6-8 I was hyperfixated on minecraft animations (now at 13 I'm on Five nights at freddys)
I had all of those phases, except for the space phase
Has there ever been an incident where you just heard a person say a cuss word then you say it to a kid
in 2nd 3rd and 4th grade i wanted to run away (i'm in 4th grade rn)
Is it wired that I am a girl and I had a dinosaur fase

Im still in my dino phase... i have watched every jurrasic park movie 10 times and got atleast every DLC in jwe2 (jurrasic world evolution 2) cause it looks realistic and just makes me imagine enclosures and main areas
Oh so you're real person
Were you singing betty boop song  Because I know that song
You mean hook line and slinker from investigators
I tried running away as a kid but I was smart enough to know that I would be better off with my parents so when I got angry and threatened to run away I just sat outside and sulked for a few minutes 😆
0:30 Jesus Christ that’s a lot of information
My brother had a wizard of oz phase, even though it was like 2020
Simple plan phase. Simple plan is awful
I like this channel
U know when I was a baby I loved Minnie mouse when I was a kid I loved MLP and when I knew abo cinnamoroll I was absolutely adictid to cinnamoroll
A therian and furry phase 🥲
that face was creapy
Me quedé con ganas de escuchar el "but now, i gotta toon out". 😑🙂
I have actually ran away... twice.
7:39 what was that
I had different phases as a child. I went through fashion phase, slime, drawing and crafting they would all go around and around

Hello rebbeca! Merry Christmas! I just wanted to say that you’re so cool and nice! At one point in my life, I was really going through it. Your videos helped me get through it, and I really enjoy your content and videos! Especially the ones where you stand up to Medusa and your past bullies! You are so awesome! Me and my sister enjoy watching you and illymations! You’re so talented and awesome! I really love your content!
I go through a faze like every month

I got rly into mythology at 10 yrs old and at 15 yrs(almost 16) still haven't outgrown my mythology phase
Hello Rebecca!!
I love her wholesome family videos! It makes me think of my family ♥
7:38 why is there a shadow on the  Bush? (The mad Musician's shadow)
my story here!  so when i was around 9 , i got the idea of running away. i packed some apple and sandwiches,a blanket and two pair of clothing. now i didnt actually run so we had this gigantic garden it was like a maze and the best was that it was connected to a forest , i went there at the edge of the forest and spend like 4-5 hours. it was getting cold so i put on the blanket and little did i know , i had brought the wrong one!!1  with a hole. so i went home and i got slapped.
FOURHUNDRED-TWENTYSIX?!?!?!??!
Not a good idea to prank your parents to make it look like you ran away from home Rebecca Pararam . You know better than that.
Uhh what happened to the Logo
I was a Dino person 🦖
The title says running away

Omg really Yt commented

(/\_/\)  ( ‘ . ‘) (>♥️
:)
Your Dad can't catch a break can he
Pony face thats me 0:53
I remember wanting to run away when I was younger but I’ve always been the good kid and I could never XD but it would be fun to like camp and hike which I thought was like running away. I’ve always wanted to spend days in the woods with like no supplies, which is why I love Minecraft also.
I’m thing I got really obsessed about was Pokémon I mean it’s so cool
Becca: ‘ That’s right I eventually achieved my dreams and thereby became a latchkey kid! ‘
off topic but becca's voice was so ANGELIC in the begining!!!
I  love you
How do kids ligit like LEAVE HOME?! Im confused😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
She said that an a lot of detail
I went thru such a doll phase, that for THREE MONTHS, DURING SCHOOL DAYS, I had a brown short hair girl baby doll that I was so fixated on that every morning when I woke up, I fed it. When I got home from school I pretended that it was saying goodbye to a babysitter, and I fed it again. You get the point. I was in love with it
can you make a sequel im a subscriber
My weirdest phase was “can’t wait to get my period!” Phase 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

I fully would pack everything I owned and spread it out on my mom’s bed and called that running away
Mom knew it was a prank.
It's so funny how they tried to do the Grinch face but they don't have mouths 😂
If I were Becca, I would’ve hid under the bed. 🤫
Right now I’m in my capybara phase 😂

poor dad lol
Best prank ever
hahaha🤣
Dear mom and dad, I ran away from home to find  my own life. I will build my own  house and I will find my own food. I will  find a job and get some money.  Don’t worry about me and put up  signs that say have you seen me.  I can come and visit you. You  can come visit me too. I will  give you my address when I find  it.  Love, Rebecca  P.S. I love you.        I love you.        I love you.        I love you, and I will miss you.  Bye!
What an awesome dad. I hope that I can be as fun to my kids as he seemed to be. Also I hope that November 18 is not a hard day for you.
NO WAY SHE MENTIONED 3 PHASES I WENT THROUGH (dinosaur phase, pony phase ( i watched mlp for a month), and space phase)
I hope your parents don't watch this cuz once I ran away and my mom beat me well I really hope your mom ain't watching this
5:00
This is cool and creative:3
You wrote even better than me when you wrote the letter when you were a kid (Im am 14)
DAMN HOW IS HERE HAND WRITING BETTER THEN MINE wait I am dyslexic 🙃 MAKES SENSE
Maybe she was bored too silly. We never know what the dolphins and the little kids are dancing
6:51 “i will give you my address when i find it” LMAOOO
2:36 did Rachel just flout up the stairs?😦😲
I'm 8 lol
Y...YOUTUBE?!
The only reason why I tried to run away is bc my step mom was abusive
When I was little I did run away from home in real life and my dad called the cops to find me and I hide where women's clean there clothes and the women told the cops I was hiding here and I did hide there 5 days and they always tell that I was here and I did run away home like 5 days and I was smart to open the front door when it's locked but I don't do that anymore because my parents put cameras to see if I leave or something else and I want to do that again but I can't >:) (I was really an evil kid from school and home and I still am and I broke 1 boy heart I didn't like him but he liked me but we were too young it happen in 5th grade my first day of 5th grade but now I'm in 6th grade I don't like girls or boys so yeah but one boy did break my heart in 3th grade before I break a boys heart in 5th)
I did run away more than one time...
E🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🙍‍♀️🏡📸🏝🏡🗻🎉
I have a weird face is like five nights at Freddys, the Concorde and lizard called again. Oh yes, my Nintendo switch buttons, Reshma/lightning McQueen/every single thing.

Ahh this story gave me total traumatizing flash backs as a kid, why did I click on this video? Damn curiosity 😅😊❤
I was in a cat phase not very long ago. 🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈
Oscars for Rachel and Mrs. Parham.😂
Tbh when I was younger I was obsessed with serial killers 😂😂😢. I think my parents should have been more concerned than they were😭😂😂

Wholesome an full of love memories...  Rebecca always makes me feel warm inside... thanks!!

“I already paid for the order, it’s not my problem how you get 246 pumpkins out here- I’ll call you back” -Rebecca Parham (LMES) 2021 6:25
Rebecca tells the best story creeps me entertained for EVER!😊😊😊

I am a weird kid too like right now
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ❤😊
The first time I lost the first time we were in our house 🏠
4:17 I LOVE THIS PART!! It captures the essence of those weirdly disturbing children show scenes, specifically disney. Also the way she's narrrarating, is PERFECT. It's giving me the same vibe as the animation, weirdly disturbing for a children's show. Maybe like an Alice and Wonderland kinda feel!  Edit: Oh and it also reminds me of Grinch--!
i love how she took the time animating mini becca to actually eat begined camera <3
Movies and comics aren’t a phase it is my life😅😅😅
Being eaten by squirrels
That’s weird how do you know has the same exact handwriting are you lying? 7:02
After watching this this video for the 50th time I noticed that the food was slowly being eaten I congrat you for the details! 👏👏👏👏
I had a titanic phase. I would calculate the time of sinking to my birth.                               100 years, 12 days, 17 hours, and 40 minutes.
0:12 I really thought she ran away from home 0:36 but it was a picnic lol
I wqs transformers and bionicles, i still love them
The funniest video I've seen today 😂
0:57 applejack!- person who had a my little pony phase
I wish I could have walked home from school it would only take 3 hours.
2:06  Oh your mom’s super pissed!
I never ran away, I was too scared my mom would die of grief, since my father died on my forth birthday. So I never really ran away 😅
1:26 my brother go always away from home withaut telling anyone where he go(sometimes he tell, but mostly he din't, now as a 17 years boy, is the same as that time when he was 7 years)
1:06 me to, I am still weird if that makes you feel better, everyone is a bit weird
6:02 hey Rebecca in retrospect it was the perfect place to reveal yourself
How did Rebecca eat the stuff if she doesn’t have a mouth??
Great intencie 😅😅😅
Cool
Cool
The funny part was let's get your dad
the strange thing is i did exactly this and i now feel extremely weird
YouTube marry me
One time I tried to run away from the boys and girls club, I had gotten in trouble so they sat me out in the vestibule (the small glass room that you enter before entering a building) next to the playground. I didn't want to get in trouble with my mom, so I decided to run out of the room to the second playground which was probably a 5-minute walk from the first playground I was next to. So I booked it out, and it was raining and thundering and dark, and one of the B&G club staff had to sprint out after me and chase me down to the fence at the end of the second playground lol.
Mama got a wonderful AWFUL idea.. Omg i cant-
I'm weird too❤❤❤❤🎉🎉
4:17  rofl  😂😂😂
I went through a 'im gonna get a new mum in the mum shop' fase

What she said 0:22
6:20 6:19
Yo if you had played dead in the shower you wouldve killed your dad out of fear
Is no one going to talk about the end of the outro? Gave me  chills! What happened?
My faze will always be fnaf and bendy
Once I tried to run a way
When I was young I wanted to run away so I got a SKIPPING ROPE and nothing else went outside walked to the end of the estate got scared and ran back 😂
YouTube I am a biggest fan
How does rebecca eat if she doesn't have a mouth
I love how your mom read the note and didn't give a shit.

Why does she have a bag?🧐
Why run away when you have YouTube
I like t-rex’s then i like amongus then i like pokémon so she’s true
You'll be fine?
That face the mother made might give me nightmares and it looks like a character  from a Dr Sue's  book
Nobody has mouths in this universe but everyone is still so expressive!
Wait youtub
WOW
4:17 the grinch
I just realized Rachel and Rebecca’s mom are the same color except one has more muted color
Bruh your are so much like me 😂

5:00 yes, they need an award
YT
There's a amungus on te Forrest ets hide on a bush
I comment way to late buuuut I really like this video! One of my favorite video on her channel (; 😁😁😁😁
I guess toon Becca is the person from those math problems
This story reminds me of something my dad and uncle did to me growing up. My dad faked his death while at the dentist office, and when I found him, I thought he had died. I still remember crying and calling my uncle, the dentist, a murderer, when my dad started laughing. When mom found out about this prank she was so angry, now its a joke between my parents and I.
0:06 I realize now that it sounds like she’s singing the song that Betty Boop songs in her first cartoon, “Dizzy Dishes” . 0 .
Are u going to finish that cake?
This is funny
*Who else realizes we stalk her at the beginning of each . E P I S O D E*
Not me. I woke up , one night and packed a bag , tent and lunch box and took off over the back wall and literally camped in the desert for 3 days before they finally found my dumb ass. My brother knew where to find me the whole time but refused to give me up on pain of death.
Cool
I had a bit of a “fantasizing about running away” phase too but I never actually did a prank like that or anything.
we’re here to watch not learn  history
no matter how many times I come back and re watch this video it still makes me laugh XD
I have a death phase as in I’m into videos either about stories of life or stories about death💀💀💀🀄️🀄️🀄️
the biggest sign of love is keeping the letter your daughter made to prank you when she was a child in perfect state and knowing exactly where it is to give it to her when she wants to remember
NOTEtices the note
Am I the only one thinking how she stuff all that thing in picnic bag without it exploding
Ok this video she says* look it’s not my problem. How do you get 426 pumpkins out here* a few videos later she is making a bunch of jack-o’-lanterns for Halloween💀
I was also a weird kid
The first time someone has realized that a parent could be the problem
Hoping she does a story where her dad did the pranking for his payback.
Do a face reveal
0:33 yea from my problema
“Let’s get your dad 😈”
When my dad was a kid he was always allowed to go out to places with his friends without any adult supervision and he wishes that I can have that and so do I 😢
6:59 this feels like what a typical I-Will-Run-Away child will say
was that a cutie mark on that ponies flank
6:18 anime :D
Your mom joined the prank… sounds epic…😂
I'm currently going through my running away phase I'm staying at my girlfriend's house right now and I'm only 12
It’s the funny grinch reference!
Hey I had a medicine in my private it hurt a lot I felt like dieing your video help me to take my mind off of it
Who else is grateful to have Becca in their life?
My childhood phase: wanting to be an orphan that got adopted (I blame cartoons with adopted magical characters 😂 *Winx Club*)
6:47 that looks like my hand writing back in the third grade
What
My face is ranch
Me and my cousins have prank wars literally every time we're in the same room but my younger cousins  stay out of it and wait for the show to begin and for some reason it's just 3 of us my sister stays out of it because... I eventually go a bit to far like the time I cut her hair in her sleep and surprisingly nothing has changed over the years my eldest cousin still trys to get back at me for dying her hair in her sleep
Becca you should so make an ARG I would love to figure it out!!!
0:56 APPLEJACK FROM MY LITTLE PONY?!?!?!
Oh this vid is about running away …about that😅
4:19
Why don't u have a mouth?
I LOVE❤ the grinch reference!
I love how everytime a scene cuts back to her a piece of food is missing, like she's actually been eating it.
Hey Rebecca the reason I think you're running away just because you freaking have a littler bag on a pole so think twice before you run away ever again
UOU CAT!!!!!!!!!!
My phase… animation or YouTube.
How did a cake fit in that
My favorite thing to watch is pretty much anime I literally don’t know why
Your family is so sweet🤗🤗
I think it's kinda cute that your family uses "messing with each other" as a love language. I think it's very sweet and endearing🤗🤗
im really into horror(im 9 btw this is my dads account) like poppy playtime, fnaf, stranger things(yes i have watch all 4 seasins), roblox doors, all that stuff
Love how the mom joined in on the joke 😂
I did that
I Done that too
Rebecca, in 12 days is my birthday.🎂 I'm going to the Cheesecake Factory for my birthday dinner like you did during your 2018 VidCon Recap part 2 video
Being eaten by squirrels really that’s the best you can come up with😂
I am sorry I accidentally disliked the video bet i re liked it
Did you steal that line right out of the Grinch?
I am in my anime phase and still am so 😂
I’ve got a phase about yellow balls with smiley faces. Still do.
I had a grub hub phase.  For real, grub hub was all over my for you page. And I DIDNT EVEN EAT GRUBHUB!
I had a tie everything up phase, mom hated it.😏 She basically had to bring the scissors with her everywhere we went.😊 Especially when I tied up both of my younger brothers and myself.🤭😅😂🤣
No way YouTube!
ah yes, the space phase, the phase im going through as a 19yr old yet im adding the eldritch horrors. as SPACE! also uhhh, i just like the deep space thing movies, and games do with the actual horrors of space.
😂😂😂 so funny! I can't actually believe YouTube commented on your channel! I've never seen a YouTube comment
Here's another, and Jacqueline to Peacock I kind of like your videos so stinkin funny😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I'm obsessed with demons and I don't know why👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹👹
I go out and in on the Dino phase
A frosted transparent glass door is just a translucent glass door
When YouTube comments on a video, you know, it’s beyond incredible
You went through a lot
"I will give  you my address when I find it" That is so adorable and true XD Love the video!
The time I'm commenting this I went to a face-to-face list what is an interesting death Skywatch this so-called generation lost in the main character dies by a box that has spikes on it and I don't know why I want to die that way and not the old dying I'm drowning or getting in a car crash I want to die so like that so when I mortal I'm most likely when I'm working I don't know 50 or something I'm probably going to strap spikes do a box scared for my life😅
Do you play super smash bros
Its so weird how you can extrapolate what the faces are supposed to be without mouths or noses
The face the mom makes at 4:21 makes me laugh forever
Pokémon card for Gregus
Every time Rebecca speaks about her Father, it simply breaks me.
Why is it always the Grinch
I ran away for like 10 minutes my mom though it was a prank...it kind was but... she was very very mad at me
I was also  weird  I had like 5 different fazes the first one was cats 🐱 then bees 🐝 then crabs 🦀 to scorpions 🦂 and then plants 🪴 now I’m all of them
Best Mum ever
True YouTube
Not gonna lie but 4:16 to 4:20 was kinda creepy 😅😮
0:27 the descriptive description
Rebaca: but now........ Me: YOU GOTTA TOUN OUT TO FINNISH THD VIDEO
How old are you
Why is no one talking about the fact that whenever the video shows Rebecca at her picnic she draws it with less food as if she is eating?
We’re Rachel
I had to pause and read it the letter
Okay so I'm still going through a phase of five nights at Freddy's can you blame me though can you please read this I'm bored today I'm watching this at night if you see this probably asleep if you don't see it'll comment on it that means I'm done with my life

Ur voice is so pretty :o
When I was eight or seven I wanted to become a space ranger when I grow up ( that’s an old dream )
Rebecca I know you're good Mewtwo but I hate your mom and sister cuz if they are bad siblings of your people and you should suit her jobs cuz they're bad low but your dad love your dad and appreciate all of the stuff that you want and by the way my name is Brian so that's explains why my profile is Abby
You are  in my life

7:17 Yesterday My friend (let's call her Friend A) was messing with my other friend ( I will call him friend B). Friend B was telling her to stop and Friend A mentioned some along "Bullying is my love language". I busted out laughing and said this "We have 5 Love Languages and then we have Friend A with the SIXTH Love Language -Bullying" We all laughed at this and Oh girl I love how I still remember this scene in this video
Uhh u forgot ur food…
I actually did this EXACTLY THIS
YOUTUBE IS HERE
Well where do you think I live? A house in the woods which is a decoy for my bunker! Don't ask...
I would run away.
I am STILL in a hello kitty phase 😅
youtube?
:)
I am in the space phase 😂
You could say I ran away once, but it's more like I wandered away when I was like 3/4. I opened the door and walked up the street. It took my parents a while to find me, as I'd wound up inside a stranger's house. I love being able to proclaim that I was the reason my parents had to put a chain lock on the door.
2:42 I like how her pony tails rise up like there devil horns
YouTube
my fase was bugs and i had it for 4 YEARS and i still have it
I wanted to run away from home when I was whooped/beaten by my parents
My mom's BF messes with us a lot, I hate it but I love it at the same time.
I love how the mom started to look like the grinch when you say “an awful idea”
The fact all the "phases" is stuff I love like I love dinosaurs, I love space, and I LOVE ponys (mlp to be precise)
oh my. 4:19 is... strange?
I'm going through a insect false and a child is tipping this
I had tears in my eyes of laughter.

I'm surprised your mom didn't laugh while reading the note, Im fucking laughing, kids are so fucking weird and such crackheads
Hey, yo YouTube, comment you 😮
I love ur videos! They are always so funny and I keep laughing to death 🤣🤣🤣😂
Applejack.... :)
Am I the only one who noticed this reference?  I realized when Becca's dad came in, he opened his arms wide. And he hit a painting of Rebecca.   I'm pretty sure it's a reference to another one of her videos called "LOST MY PANTS IN WONDERLAND"! 🤔
So her mom is the grinch now 😂😂😂
Grinch reference
I “had” a phyco and goth fase. *I’ve had it for 8 years so far*
the funny thing is, while other kids said they would ride away i practically did it. it was spring break for me in i think 3rd or 4th grade. My mom and our roommate were at work and my younger and older sister got in a fight against me. We were fighting while playing outside so after we argued they ran inside and locked me out. we all didnt have phones at the time so i just continued playing without them while being locked out. i heard my sister call my name to the back door so i assumed she was gonna let me back in. I waked over to the back door to see a note, 2 dollars, and my shoes. The note saying "go away we dont want you anymore, mom wont miss you either!"  and instead of being sad or angry i was kinda excited. I dont know why i was excited maybe i thought that i was going on some adventure idk. I put on my shoes, took the money and started walking down our street and around our neighbor hood. After walking for about 2 hours and playing with the stray dogs i got hungry. My friend lived about two blocks away from me and i decided to go to her house and ask her dad if i could live with him. I walked for about 30 minutes before seeing a car that looked vaguely similar one to the car my mom and our roommate drove to work, Which was a yellow-goldish Honda van. I didnt think anything of it but as it got closer to me while i was walking i started hearing yelling that sounded like my mom but i didnt know where it was coming from. Until the car pulled up to me. Turns out my mom and roommate left work early and were driving to see my moms daughter wearing a blue ninja turtle shirt, yellow tie-dye shorts, and purple sandals. I was obviously in trouble before i showed them the note and told my mom what my sisters did. My mom busted into the house and after i heard children screaming, shoes being thrown, and the sound of spanking i got McDonalds with our roommate. Im generally surprised no one called CPS with all the bloody murder screams. I dont know if any of my family members remember this but i remember every second of this event in my child hood. XD
i have the Smart frase is a frase that you read lots of BOOKS!
0:53 i love how the child enjoys stargazing like me, i clearly see that because of the big dipper (an asterism in the northern constellation ursa major) put on the back of his tablet
This video is just hilarious
I have a killing phase i like to pretend to kill my barbie😂😂
I’m pretty sure right now Rebecca’s going through a witch of the woods phase, she might not grow out of it
0:52 I never got out of my space phase lol
I also have the sixth one 😅
The Grinch reference 4:14
The grinch refrence was everything
The endinggggg👀👀👀
There’s no such thing as normal. Everyone is weird in their own way, and it’s ok to be different. If people can’t see you for who you are, then they have a lot to learn x
George someone to inspire me to make this YouTube channel along with other❤
Nah, you’re mother is an absolute chad, she stood up for you multiple times that you told us and acted so well the father bought the whole running away thing. What a savage

Yes
What if… you only think ur weird, and no one else does?
4:10 Nice Grinch reference
To me I think all the people who are creative now with their imagination stuff were called weird back then I too was a weird one.
My Alf face
My family messes with each other to =v=
i feel like rebecca would be the person to say "im scared of the dark" and yet chase a killer asking for a autograph-
Im still In my dinosaur phase
I would do this  When I was like 4 and said I'M GOING TO MY FRIENDS FAMILY. They were on the other side of the world there was around 2 oceans between us including wallking Alaska and Russia or China
Bruh I m in 6th but nobody trusts me with the house keys
The video shall not end if the running out has not occurred

Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain, pain serious why don’t you Why does your dad not smack your booty? I know that sounds disgusting but literally why don’t you make me poop? It’s
you look like my mom
I relate to the beginning of the story a lot. Like taking a tiny blanket and a stick and going to hide in a different room to pretend it was a house in the woods
I wanted to take over the world when i was a kid lmao
You're so cool😊❤
Hey its 8 for me
At first I thought you had that cause the treehouse burnt down but then you revealed why you had it (the bag)
Where did the stick go????
I have a Pokémon/Digimon phase that started when I was 7 and hasn’t really stopped.
7:36 Does anyone else wonder what was that noise?
At the first scene a kid but now are you watching it I am still a kid I’m realizing how do you fit the food in there?!
I had a Cat Phase
Is it just me or do I love the detail that the food is slowly getting eaten,Nice detail!❤😅
You are amazing and not really good about how the world feel like they do that comes with it out there for the only person else right now you must know how!
You are amazing and not just because the idea of anq for me?!
The only reason they can be in a place is a bit too hardware that you can't do with your body and your own skin color for this type of situation as you do with your skin color and your face is just like an example that comes with a large body.
7:35  well that was ominous
I love how the food gets eaten throughout the vid
I find it funny that I have been trying youtube and I am equally energetic in real life than in the videos I have been working on
I've been stuck in a dino/dragon phase since I was 3
Incase anyone wanted to know, here's the full note: Dear Mom and Dad, I am running away from home to find my own life. I will build my own house and find my own food. I will find a job and get some money. Don't worry about me and put up signs that say    have you seen me. I will come and visit you. You can come and visit me too. I will give you my adress when I find it.  Love, Rebecca P.S. I love you I love you I love you I love you And i will miss you.  Bye!
Well look welcome to my world look who got a purple eye from my dad😢
4:19 . Nice “how the grinch stole crismas” reference there. Too bad that stuff copyrighted:)
7:38 wtf ?
6:51 must be the most paused part.
OMG YOUTUBE how can you talk!?!
Ok😐
Wait is that the muffin that wants to die he even made a song about
HEY Rebecca why in the end you don't eat?
👩.                                                                                                                                                                                                   👚👉.                                                                                                                                                                                             👖
7:22 with the context that her dad died in 2014 i think them words came from her heart
You actually had a pony faze because the pony that you were holding looks like applejack from my little pony any especially didn't know i was obsessed with my little pony and i'm still a kid😊
i kinda wanna do this but actually live away from home for a few weeks to a month or two. Just to scare them a little
Why when she’s screaming and the dad is like mad or something I have no idea how to explain it but why is it so funny 😂
Everybody is a little weird so you don't need to act as if your not weird in your videos
In the start of the video instead of thinking why you were running away I thought about if you were singing the Betty Boop or Boop Oop a-door or something else
i tryed to run away 3 times it did not work T-T
Dino phase me. Hehehe
"But now!-" **something moves** "..." "**leaves**" FREE FOOD!!

😂😂😂😂
Will take up the intier coich and I m 4 fet7
I really like the way you took the old shows and turned it more modern
Wow, seeing Becca with Vasovagal is really neat in a weird way, the way I deal with it is having a sugary drink next to me and have it immediately after it happens
My phase was space
Happened to me before
I love you your videos
At the end u made sure to get a slice of cake
You are so pretty
Hi
I love Bayblade
Gugugu
You remind me of my English teacher (who also teaches drama)
I love your videos
I think it’s your face on the start if it is it’s beautiful
I had a running away phase, but my older sister was good at tracking me down (really just to the end of the street because I was scared of the big road) and luring me back. I'm pretty sure my Mom just went, "H! Go get Alie, she 'ran away' again and its almost dinner time."
You know how you were talking about obsessions and stuff like that my obsession is snatching your vids!
I have a sister in law that really did run away from home and no one noticed she was gone. 3 weeks later, when she finally walked back into her house, her Mom yelled at her about not doing a chore. She was one of 13 kids though, so maybe that was why... I used to always want to run away from home, and my Mom told me to do it, she was sick of putting up with me. She even brought me a suitcase and told me to pack. Ah, childhood trauma.
I ran away when i was 12 and i got hit by a truck without breaking anything
You're so funny running away into a house in the woods pls don't do that stay safe out there

My phase is that I was obsessed with Harley Quinn I’m not joking I was so obsessed I begged my mom to change my name to Harley but because my mom was a good mother she always told me no and I ended up growing out of the phase about nine months after it began but let me tell you that phase was so insanely strong that my cousins still call me Harley to this day
Eaten by squirrels
I broke the streak
This angles got a big CABOOSE 🤩
Holy Jupiters, you have such creativity😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why do you keep saying oodalales so many times
I would run away to the bathroom as well if I got even relatively angry I would take a blanket, my iPad, a pillow and a bag of chips into the bathroom and think I would live in the bathroom forever. It stopped when my dad unlocked the bathroom door and turned on the shower. I learned my lesson because my chips got soaked.❤😂
APPOL
They’re magically delicious
Cool!
I went through a Bakugon phase.
#SomethingElseYT  ( Lol not the only one who was a weird kid XD )
I did the same thing although I took it another level and actually kept running away down my block.
I kinda did a similar thing at summer camp when one of the teen counselors and I had the idea of me hiding in a cubby and pretending I was lost. I hid and the counselor took off saying they couldn't find me. Took a good 15 or so minutes before my dad caught on to what happened, dw he wasn't mad. I don't remember if anyone was mad but it was pretty funny!
The moment when you (as a kid) tourned around with that ,, weird " glasses, I was laugh 🤣🤣 Also, your videos make me smile 😗😩
Back when I was a little kid I got angry with my mom and ran out of the house. However, I didn't get far because dad spotted me as he turned the corner (he was coming home from work)  Also me and my parents show their love by roasting and teasing each other (I'm 17 almost 18 and I still like to play rough with my dad and occasionally my mom)
Lovely story!
She just Lancer Deltarune'd her way offscreen in the end; incredible. Story was also an interesting family love good vibes thing. I was kinda feeling "WHAT NO PARENTS SCARE THIS IS--" but the end wrapped it up nicely. Very fun!
HOW DID SHE GET A STICK?!?!?!?!???!?!?
OMG IT’S YOUTBUBE
I had a scary movie fase and I still do to this day
6:13-6:24 omg
Me if I was in the story acting:”I shall live in in the woods for my Family break”(but instead I go to the backyard where everyone was)
there is another prank that i made up called the fake kidnapper its just this but no note and leaving the back door open and making fake footprints ur parents will think someone kidnapped you also make sure to do it late kin the night or early in the morinig
4:13 holy shit ur mum is secretly the grinch was she a "mean one"?  *seinfield music plays*

5:16 Ah yes, the most dangerous predator of the suburban neighborhood, The squirrel
4:10
I DID THIS •_•& I'm stupid
Maybe I shouldn’t argue with YouTube
YouTube why do you think this is creative
Wait is YouTube
I don't think I ever tried to run away from home but I did something even dumber; I wandered around the neighborhood way past curfew. My poor mom made sure I knew all of the horrible scenarios that plagued her mind while I was gone. It probably took three of those lectures for it to stick with me, but I'm brain damaged.
I’m 10 thanks for the advice 😂
Oo yes
AHHHHH
Creepy
I really want to know what the sound in the woods was. Like, do you think it's the ghost that lives in her treehouse, or some other thing? Because you never see it, but you hear more noises
BACK WITH ANOTHER BANGER
I hate those two!
I Like apple and grapes got eaten
Why does it say in the background have a butt
ok the phase i'm in started about 5 years ago the FNAF phase
My faze is crying
Did anyone realize that every time it switched back to Becca in the forest a little of food went away? Nice job for adding that Becca💙
Hilarious story!!! My running away story wasn't like this, though. I ran away from home the summer before my senior year of high school. Here's what happened...   So both parents were/are abusive in multiple ways and I just couldn't take it anymore. My dad was living in Florida at the time and when it was time to fly there, I packed as much as I could into a duffle bag, suitcase, and my purse. On my way back "home," I dodged my mom and stepfather at the airport and my friend picked me up and we left for her house. This ended in a really rough and messy falling-out which led to getting kicked out of my friend's house for becoming the monster I was running away from. I lost myself for a while and was figuring out how to navigate school while homeless. But thanks to the power of going from house to house, homeless shelters, locker rooms, and city benches, I was still able to do my homework!  So I graduated high school out of spite and invited my parents because I knew they didn't believe I could do it. And boy, was I correct... The incubator told me right after the ceremony that she and my stepdad had a bet going that I either wasn't going to graduate or was gonna graduate pregnant... while my dad decided it would be cute and quirky to throw a fit because I finally stood up to him and made it clear that I was done taking his narcissism crap. Safe to say, I haven't spoken to them in 4 years and I'm much better off now. Still healing, but yeah.  This isn't an encouragement for people to run away from home, by the way. I lost all my friends and family, lost myself completely and became a really awful person until reaching rock bottom. A lot of traumatic stuff happened that has left deep wounds that will take many years to be healed. In hindsight, I probably should have just waited or called CPS or something because I would've been much better off. But it's my story and I get to decide how it ends.
I finally googled Oo-De-Lally since I could not remember what its from. Robin hood was a great movie!
I had this same faze 2 years ago
I tried to run away once, I took a suitcase.
Did you eat a piece of cake 🎂🎂 anyways i love those vids

Let’s be honest here your mum knew what was going on

When I was 12 I actually did run away from home for a few hours. Had plans to live in a big park a couple suburbs over and hire myself out as a babysitter to make money. The cops found me
The fact that she got to be able to make the grinch smile scene without a mouth blows me away. Probably the best scene in YouTube history.
how does the lemonaied not spil in the bag Rebecca tell me how
4:17  She turned into the grinch
I had a runaway phase too. Mine was when I was in preschool, and I ran away from that place alllll the time. As in *once a week, the school called my mom to tell her I had run away yet again.* And it wasn't just school, I ran away from home a lot too, mostly down to the park which was about 1 block away and had a path directly leading to it from the back of my house. I don't remember most of these run away trips in took, probably because I was so young and I have the memory of an ice cube. I do remember one time, when I took my Dora backpack and TRIED to run away, buuut I was lured back with the promise of dinner by my mom and grandmother.
Hey I wanted the first slice if cake😡😡
My phase was homework. But I always love learning and I'm nine, and I still get a phase every six months
He's probably thinking on her head what now and the money for you thinking you are gonna die right now dead and the dance for me thinking is going insane
6:24-6:34 Wait, Rebecca, why did you order 426 pumpkins in the middle of the forest? 😳
Seriously, I need to learn how to draw and animate. These story animations are pretty cool 😎!
The hankerchip bag is a scientific miracle
2:20 your the best 👍💯
Realistic to my story about a girl called Margo that runs away from home because she doesn’t like her teacher because her teacher is mean, so she runs away and make new friends
i got a japan fase i still do
My sister had a HUGE DINO phase. Dont even ask how huge.
serously, how are you still single?  i mean you would be quite a catch. i love your stories and humor
One time I actually ran away.....😅 ......yep....
I once tried to run away with a backpack full of stuffed animals, one of my brothers wrestling action figures, and a couple of boxes of Hamburger Helper. Not the meat or any pots/pans, or even clean water, literally just the box of pasta and seasoning.   I wasn’t a bright kid. I also never made it out of the backyard.
I went through this phase too.
The part where he screams at the top of his lungs in the reacts like a superhero

4:21 wow😊
"It's not a phase mom"  Said every kid ever who is going through a phase
my famlly also has that thing
The detail in Rebecca’s videos are insane you can hear the prowling of the musicians spirit and then the second step of footsteps in the next video!! Another thing is that you can see and hear that she is calling someone to buy like a bunch of pumpkins and her next video had a bunch of pumpkins!!! I love the attention to detail :)   Time stamps >>> Prowling of the musicians spirit: 7:36 - Ordering a bunch of pumpkins: 6:23
But we never got more at eight
Raise your hand if your still in your space phase 😢✋
4:17 Grinch reference 😂😂
Dino faze right here
One year later and I'm still on a Danganronpa phase

The funny thing is as I watch this, I’ve actually attempted to run away and I didn’t actually get caught, I just went back😂Didn’t even make it to the road not on my street, I only got to the top of my road😅(Reasons on why I went back: I live near relatives and I went back immediately bc I remembered that I wouldn’t make it far enough to not be caught🥲I also brought nothing for that reason😃)
Why do you make it creepy in the end
I DID THIS TOO
Bro be giving me Grinch vibes

HAVENT YOU HEARD THAT IF YOU LOOK AWAY FOR A SECOND THEN EVERYTHING GOES WRONG? IM ONLY A LITTLE KID! thank you for reading my childhood story😅

What is your favorite color ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💖
Why do you think so beautiful
Can we take a mommet to rember  I wanna be a ghost story!  -Rebecca 2018
True
the picnic is 8 mins long and u left-
Pff! Half the stuff I did when I was young(er) made Dad ask himself, "What the hell is up with him?" I'll tell you what's up with me. One word: Autism
You're really funny
I used to be in a Minnie Mouse phase, a few years later I moved into a Frozen phase and was OBSESSED with Elsa and therefore changed my favorite color from red to blue, then my older (adopted) brother introduced me and my sister to the amazing Minecraft YouTuber that is Aphmau (and if any of y'all disagree with me then that's ok) which got me into my phase of purple wolves and the amazing song Faster Car, and finally, I found a couple Minecraft videos of The Backrooms, and wadaya know, good ol Aphmau did a Backrooms video too which got me into the phase I'm in right now and will probably be in for the rest of my life which issssssss,  da da da daaaaaaa, MY TWO DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES!!! The one is my "Friendly happy and semi-social" personality that I use around my friends and family, so it's basically the one I use daily but, as soon as I'm alone in my room where no one can see me, ohhhhh hoh hoh boy, my "Dark side and Backrooms obsessed, weird" personality comes out. This one is how my brain brings all my past trauma (from horrific animes I accidentally watched) and fears into my life without it being too scary. I've actually turned it into a pretend game with.....Minecraft characters (😅😬.) It's about my YouTube self and character backstory that I eventually want to have on my channel and my "dark side" (which my brain interprets as my "inner demon" that I acquired from falling into The Backrooms that I am able to control.......mostly) Idk what else to write for this absurdly large comment soooooo ye (Jk, forgot to mention that this weird phase has changed my favorite color from not one but two. They are still purple and now black has been added to the mix cuz why not🤪💜🖤)
I actually was thinking about playing VR
lol!
My family has that exact same thing, messing with each other. We play pranks, make terrible (mainly adult) jokes that always made us laugh. My dad was the worse of the bunch though... He CONSTANTLY scares me to the point where if the room was to quiet, I would check everywhere to make sure he's not there or just sleeping.
Mine is XX tentacion
l Iike the way your Mom teams up with your prank team, l Iike it! 😊👍
so, for me its not that I have a dinosaur "phase" because I just love dinosaurs
My hole life I had had a space face but now in __ grade I have had a cow face I love cow for some reason
It’s OK if somebody copies
Da grinch mom and demon dad
What a nice prank.  R.I.P Rebecca's Dad  You will be missed 😔😥💙
🚓🕹

I am from India and planning to runaway from home so if there's anybody who want to run away you can plan with us... We will leave in 4 days Or 5 days... I am from kanpur.. And planning to shift anywhere else... More people more safety
Dd Dd😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤😂😂😂❤❤❤😂😂❤❤😂😂❤❤❤ 😂😂😂😂
I like pony s when i was 6
Hi
Lindo video. 👏🏻
I had that same phycsation to but I actually did it, multiple times. I was dumb but I learned my lesson!
Since I grew up in a large household and was the middle child I would occasionally tell my mom at a very young age that I will run away but whenever I would walk a few inches out the  door I would just come back inside the house crying because I was hungry. Also, mind you, I was about 6 or 8 years old
You should have spare the "dont worry about me" part! Your mother would have been outragous.. but with this line.. she probatly thought das you really gone for "build your own House" and was already thinking what she will wear, if she is coming over to visit you :D
I was in a chicken nugget and axolotl phase
Once I was at the backyard and my mum screamed "SHANIA WHERE ARE YOU?!" And I was like wth to myself and I heard the front door open I ran inside and saw my brother putting on a shirt and him and my mum screaming "SHANIA COME BACK HOME!' and I was standing next to my dog and looking at this and my mum saw me and came running to me screaming "SHANIA THERE YOU ARE MY BABY GIRL!" And she and my brother came running to me crying and hugged me and in my mind I was like wth is happening rn? So yeah I still laugh about it
Our sixth one is fighting echo other weird right
Yo it’s apple jack almost all of us as kids watched that….
I have something really related to this but I didn't do exactly I was really tempted but I didn't cuz I figured I wouldn't have any money or any shelter or a food and water so yeah luckily I knew actual logic at that time period so yeah
haha
Hey Rebecca Peterson do
I had the same phase in 4th-5th grade 😂
Her: Hooooowever if you would like to join me I will tell you a story about running away  me: OfC i lOvE hEaRiNg sToRyS
Anyone notice during her picnic scenes she had a tea set that Looked lie, Mrs.pots and chip from Beauty and the beast?
I'm watching the background for the figure that's making the noises at the end

Hahaha
I'm actually thinking about how beautiful you are
😮
I run away from daycare😂
I had this phase as well, I also really wanted to go train hopping-- where you jump onto the open cart of a train and go off to who knows where, yes Beverly hills Chihuahua encouraged this-- Although I could never live out their fantasy because my parents are always home, and even if they were gone they'd be back very shortly--  It's not that I have a bad home life that makes me wanna do this, but it just gets so boring in a day to day life, sometimes I wanna just go out and do.. idk, something-- night in the woods also just made me want to do this even more, just run out to beat up an old car, climb a fallen down tree. IDK it's probably cause I was pretty sheltered lol-- I still want to do this, it's even on my bucket list-- if I just do it once, I'll never feel the need to do it ever again.  IDK anyone relate? It always felt like no one related to that feeling of wanting to just, go out in the woods into an abandoned house, or, just go exploring the neighborhood doing who knows what-- just a little spree of mini petty crimes--
Oh my god stop it Rebecca as Running away😡😡
My faze at 4 was a pony  At 5 and 6 my faze was spase   My faze at 7 was zombies  and my faze at 8 was wolf's  Ps I'm 8 years old 😊

My Health And Social Care Actually Ran Away Kinda? She was In The Running Away Phase at 13? I thinks That's What She Said  She Was Going to Pay For A Train Ticket And Leave Her Mother Actually Paid For Her Train Ticket And Got On But She Regretted It After she got to The Stop.
“Let’s Get Your DAD♦️-♦️”

Did any one notice that at the end a piece of cake was missing😍
say hi bro
Same thing with the part of the parents
I am a kid and when I finished school my mom wasn't  Waiting for me And the bus  Is so early  so I just walked home seriously It was  So early!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THE  VIDIO  WAS     HALARIUS🤣😂🤭😜😝🥲🤩😍
Ok but HOW IS SHE SO GOOD AT HANDRIGHTING AT THAT AGE?
I am not a oodoo Lally
Bringing grilled cheeses and cake on a picnic? Sign me up
Never grew out of my horse phase
"HA! Running away to a house in the woods."    Have you seen kings of summer?
The little details in in life :D. Every time it cuts back to Rebecca (Adult) a little bit of something at the picnic, been eaten; Great details Rebecca!
but how do you eat
Ok so idk if anyone noticed this but I love how she puts in detail like when she shows her in the picnic she edits a missing piece of cake, fruits or sandwiches. Just a little thing I noticed. Good job keep up the work becca!
Mine was I was very good at drawing when I was a kid
why is this so relatable💀
I love the little details in this! Each time Becca cuts back to the picnic something else has been eaten
are you my clone? cause for me when i was in preschool-2nd grade i would go to a daycare and wait for my dad to pick me up and then when i got into 4th grade i would be able to walk what i believe was a mile through the town to my house
I know
im in a tornado phase for some reason
Hahaha I love itt
Mom: she'll get hungry     Me: she has no mouth though
Me:*Watching the intro with her slowly getting more demonic*      Also Me:I wonder how long she practiced that?
how did you make your annimation???
I remember when I was 7 but I'm 18 now
i went thro a communism faze
I tried to run away once, I did not even make it to the end of my very short drive way! Also my parents were not concerned at all, I guess they knew I would come back 😂
And scissors and scissors
One of my phases was  accessible fire
*A wonderful, awful idea…*
Make a movie for everyone to watch on TV you stood I love your videos respect I asked you why she figures all the time and I told you asleep but I have speed problems and you're funny
Well I was a outside with my pet dog and a alarm went off from a car I was like very very scared and then I'll run home
So relatable
I had a Pokémon phase now I’m in a Fnaf phase
I've never done it and I'm a kid
💴💵💵💴💴💵💵💵💵💴💴💵.     8:40
4:29 Rebecca: parents may not always be cool, but sometimes they’re really cool Advert: cuts to a woman eating a burger
I also went in the bathroom 🥲
why do you need food if you don't have a mouth how did you eat the food
5:03 like mother like daughter 💅
I’m a weird kid 😰🤓
🎃
You need some milk
Blah blah blah
Ohhhhhh no
I had a pony phase definitely
4:18 that ain’t no mother and that’s the grinch
i wanted to do that but when i was packing my bag my mom said we have pizza yeah and every body likes pizza so i was like meh another time
I ran away from home before and there was a treehouse! •,•
What the hell does Becca need 420 pumpkins for😂
What the hell does Becca need 420 pumpkins for😂
You should get into skyrim, again, me, her son.
I had a rms titanic phase and a ms poseidon phase at 7.
I’ve done this before, well at least tried 🥲
This is Morgan’s daughter : She was 1 and loved horses and now she rides horses lol
What could have given me the idea of that the thing you said earlier in the video was maybe the name of the video
Im gonna run away tomorrow and i have somewhere to stay and i have a destination on where i NEED to go so wish me luck ill update
my faze im in is Dinosuars and space and amogus
6:22 the best part
I wonder how Becca eats without a mouth…
My fun thing to do as a kid was see if space had to end which it did cuz if you look close your eyes in space it made me like the space does have an end to it and my other favorite drawing I want to become an artist but I'm not that good
The fact that you're mom got in on the joke is amazing. It's pretty funny. And this was a very sweet tale
Love the Grinch reference
Why you so pretty
It's so weird seeing Ur real face
E
I really like ponies I like them like two years ago but now I’m nine and I don’t really like them anymore I am like 🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮
I LIKE
Awesome
Her dad probably played Dungeons and Dragons for far too long.
I happen to think that every mother has a grinch "smirk" of her own. They are just very rarely seen in the wild.
Ok I don't why I'm doing this but I'm trying to figure out what is happening in rebecca's woods like I'm some sort of detective so I go from the Halloween video at the end to other videos ware sudden hints to the creatures and ghosts going full detective mode
I had a dinosaur faze.          *And I still have one.*
Lol 😂 so cute 🥰 and funny 😄!
Ha ha!
What’s the point of a picnic when you have no mouth?
Hello if I make it to the end you r a ✨legend✨                                                                                                                                    Hello!

Ok my arm is tired ✨the end✨
Everyone did this t fi did it
See if i was the father i personally would not let that slide
I hade a unicorn face...I still have it (Im 10)
Lol
When I was little I got in a fight with my family and I wanted to run away so I actually packed a backpack and sat on the stairs contemplating whether I should do it or not because I knew that I wouldn’t have food water or a place to stay so I was just thinking of a plan and I just sat in on the stairs crying for two hours and tell my mom found me
I had pant phase :D
I got a pokemon face
6:25   SIX HUNDERD AND TWENTY FIVE!!!!!!!?????
I would probbaly be the one eating the cake at the picnc.
I am so sick today 🤧🤕🤒
This is so relatable, accept I did run away from home, with my friend, but her dad ended up finding us both instead. But we have all had that one desire of running away.
me do space phase
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🖤🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍💚💚💚💚💛💛💛💚💛💛💛💛💚💙💚💙💙💙🤍🤍💞💓💗💗💓💞💕💘💘💖💝💝❣️

I remember trying to run away. I packed my bags and almost set off, but I wondered how I would get food, so I stopped.
Oodalallie
I just love my plushies 🦄🌺🌸
Like mother like daughter
Rebecca is very classy
I have been stuck in a art phase for the last 2 years
i dont know why but i eralier i wonderd why becca is the only one with brown hair but i relaizd that her dad also ha brown hair. IM SO STUPID
Ummmm  nice
One little detail that I love is that as the video continues, the food on the picnic blanket progressively gets eaten more and more
Yea I still have that phase at age 8
I used to be obsessed with FNAF. I'm so embarrassed. I love coding rn btw
this just sus
6:15 i cant stop rewatching it🤣🤣
6:15 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Tooning in HAHAHAAHAH
AMAZING SING YOU NEED 500M SUBS
Don't worry you're not the only one who's weird as a kid and I'm still a kid
Ok, but wtf was this the ending, and the 400+ pumpkins? Edit: ooh, the pumpkins are for her next video, that's really smart foreshadowing Also edit: the next video DOES say that living alone in the woods makes you hear things following you... but I don't think that's is, because we hear that noise too, and we're not in her head or something  Hmm....  Food for thought
“Eaten by a squirrel”
I love your videos 😍💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
how did you just not move but you was running  at the end?
welp' does any girl get jelous of rebecca?
Me: WHAT ABOUT THE FOOD
I survived my own for a week when ma dad kicked me out
you’re the most luckiest Woman on earth can your mom help you run away by pretending that you were not in a house but you were
I always want to get away from my mom and your mom helped you you’re really lucky do you have a mom like that my mom  climb up twohell
hahaha

LET ME EXPLAIN ARG???????
Funny at first i really like foxes than wolfs and now owls well mainly because of me really loving the demon stolas
I love you u r my favorite   prsin
Let's take a moment to appreciate how Becca managed to capture the exact energy of the Grinch smile without a mouth
You or so weird I don’t care lol 😂
My mom told me when I tried to 'run away' I spent too long debating if I could survive off peanut butter sandwiches to actually do the running away part.
I didn’t know what life was like back in the old 1990s and stuff like that because I wasn’t born at that time
You were a weird kid!? *mind explodes through my head*
Wow of Rebecca model you're so cool and that's so cool and I didn't want to say but yeah it really makes ORS are so cool
-7:43
I went through a Titanic phase... wait... did I say "went through"? I meant it's not a phase.
I love how much spooky setting stuff is in the background. Please tell me it will pay off in a big way someday
i brought the chicken
I wish werd as a kid to
Instead of caring for the girl, Mom pulls the prank on Dad. Heck Yeah.
6:27 foreshadowing???
I'm still in my fnaf face
How were you eating
messing with my friends is our only mission in life
I can’t believe YouTube actually commented on this lol
Magnificent  🤧😍😙
Her clothes 😍  are cute 😍
I literally  want  that  Rebecca  doll but I don't  have  that kind of money
OH mY GOsH I ReAD THiS nOTe ANd …

Hi 👋
I got to run I hope you watch this until the end of the video unless you you won't get it you won't get it unless you watch it all the way threw
how come she got a picnic even tho she has no mouth 🧐
I laughed so hard when his dad found her
So true
I love how the food is gradually eaten ❤️
Sorry not FaceTime phase
Pony FaceTime you mean watching my little pony on Netflix all the time every time with a toy Apple JackYeah that seems right
0:48 I’m 10 rn and mine is ummmmmmmmmm Genshin and I can play da game and undertale but I wanted to play it but cant
I’m the space phase guy
My fixation was dragons
There has to be lore with the witch of the woods and forest and the end scene
when I was small I was severly depressed because I thought that my big brother owned everything and no one loved me lmao              ........ wait wut
once i "ran away" to my grandmas house down the street (i had been many times and my street is essentially all old people so there was 0 real danger lol) and when i knocked on her door (to tell her "hey i ran away and im living with you now" ) she wasnt home. so i went back home
My brother and I ran away with a friend when we where in 3rd grade. At first we planned to open the school gate (which we some how managed to unlock even though it was supposed to be locked), so we could let everyone run away with us. However, someone figured out that the gate was unlocked and got a new lock before we could put our plan into action. In the end, we decided to escape together at the park we always met at after school. I very suprisingly managed to get a hundred dollars and some granola bars to pack. We walked along the ditch near the park for about 10 minutes before we chickened out and went back. When our parents where angry, my friend told them that we where kidnapped by a gut with blue hair, and that we had just managed to escape. For some reason, I don't think that they believed that.
I DID THE HIDING IN A ROOM “RUNNING AWAY”/MAKING A FORT IN A ROOM TOO
my familie's love language is messing with each other too. it's fun lol
Gotta say that my dinosaur phase I’m addicted will never end
Legends says she haven’t tuned out since
how can drink with no mouth
It's not a mistake✨ITS A MASTERPEICE!✨
ur merch is 2 expensive
I was a trian phase
Promble is I did for real but not on and with my brother who was 7 years older than me I was 8 at the going to base ball practice
am weird to
What’s was that oh god run girl run
"But now..."  "But now" what? "But now" WHAT? REBECCAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!  [forms search party]  Lovely story, thank you for sharing. Really fun watching how the art animation have blossomed compared to videos from previous years.
I used to be goth Hihi
I DID THIS A LONG ITME AGO AHAHAHAAUHA
How do your animated characters eat?
I would see Young Rebecca as the cool kid I would look up too
Every time I got angry I would pack myself a lunchbox and go to the playground castle and live there for about ten minutes (which felt like hours to someone with as bad time perception as me) and then go back to my parents
No tuning out..?  Well I loved your video about running away, gives me great flashbacks if my childhood.
Regarding the phase part  I'm 16 and STILL going through my dinosaur phase.....
0:52 APPLEJACK!
guys i found something out, after the screaming part she was arguing on how to get about 426 pumpkins out there in the next video you see that she has a whole lot of pumpkins in her tree house  edit: by screaming part i mean 6:23
I gotta toon out
MAKE YOUR ANIMATIONS WORSE I CANT STOP LOOKING AT YOUR VIDEO'S ART WHEN I WANT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE AEFWEWFEWFWEGRFE54YHYMYUKIIKUYHBTGB FGVFFT
Anyone else wondering how she ate all that food?
Most parents are worried cuz most kids like males and females or gender-fluid get r4p3d  so parents are worried about kids
I did something like this when I was a tike, I got the munchies one afternoon and wanted something sweet, but no one wanted to walk to the store with me so I went by myself, it all ended good but I gave my folks one heck of a scare.
Do any of you know wings of fire? It's a chapter series bout dragons with pretty long books, in all including the legend books is 17 books, I  finished 16 out of the 17 in a school year, i am .s t i l l. obsessed.
Welll I have ran away a lot so it was kinda a game?
Even tough this video was posted a while ago I just want to say it's great!
my phase: slime and gaming
I went through A breaking the fourth wall Space and conspiracy theories fazes all at once
wen i was a kid a liked space
Pt6
.
My phases were games games games and games😂
I don’t think no one noticed but your singing is beautiful!!!
I went through a phase of collecting porcelain dolls
My phase is wer- oh no my dinosaur WAIT HEL-
I was i weard kid to and still am
Props to Becca's dad for immediately getting ready to find his daughter. A good dad right there
This is the 1st video I have watched of you
I also went through that running away fase
Notice how her hair in the thumbnail shows devil horns.
Fnaf
I wanted to run away and I wanted to since 4th grade
Good handwritting, for such a young age.
This is a very bad time to be recommended this ;-;
Pleaseee this reminded me of the time my older siblings played a prank on my mum that they'd accidentally 'killed' me and our little sister. We were ALL in on it but only my older siblings got grounded bc 'your meant to set an example and you failed. You didn't even teach them not to laugh whilst playing dead!' 💀💀💀
Mom was holding me up I was crying because I so blood like the Medicals came and fixed me up I had to go back to the trip house but not my real house
I'm not joking that happened
One time on the trip I ran on payment I tripped my knees and elbows were bleeding my mouth was bleeding forehead nose and Chin was scraped
The funny thing is I’m less energetic in my vids (I’m super energetic around friends and I’m around my friends a lot)
*Me in the Anime Phase*              DATTEBAYO
mama got a wonderful awful idea… 4:13
I'm currently fixated to the vr  aka type meta quest 2
I had..   A Pony Fase  A Doll Fase  Imagination Fase  And Video game Fase.  That still Exists.  Just like my Art Fase
i know she donest draw mouths.... but how does she drink?
I had a spending money faze
4:15she looks like the deveal
She was a troublemaker as a kid
4:20   look at this with no context
Running away from the homies
I run away before
Im still in my ddlc phase *and* my space phase
VIDEO IDEA: watch every season Jojo's bizarre adventure and make a video about how you liked it
I remember this one time we had thought my sister had ran out the back door and kinds just disappeared, turns out she fell asleep in a basket of towels
good handwriting
Is that your face?! I am new!
I got an undertale phase.
Just to let you know the dad is more gullible in my opinion
I love how every time we see the picnic there is less food every time
I love your video sooo much more 🤗💜💖🤎🖤👨‍👩‍👧🐑🦄🍰🧁🍫🍬🍭🍨🍩🍪🎂🍿🍥🍡🥠🍦🍟🥨🍉🧃🌈🎈🎉🎊🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
I had a new phase every 3 months. Now that I think about it....
I LOVE YOU MOM
Anyone gonna talk about the creepy ending?
Really the sowers
My sister ran away for real like 10 times
“Bro it’s just a prank!”  *THE PRANK*
I thought my family were the only ones with the sixth love language
Not me
I had a HUGE space phase and everyday I would go to preschool and dress in my astronaut costume. I was also that weird kid that cleaned up after everyone
my family also has the sixth messing around
I laughed so hard when the dad opened the shower and saw a little Rebecca hiding and then they both just go like “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!”
The latest time was a kid my phase was hello kitty phase
And guess what every time the next frame happens one food gets taken out by a bite or by the whole thing
Fun fact one time I ran out of my house the neighbor found me and brought me back home just because I wanted to pick up my siblings from school
Why do you have that
Hello
Fidgets are the new habit
I had him iPad face cause I really like playing games a lot like Roblox
No one: Beccas dad:WE MUST GO FORTH AND RETURN THE SECOND BORN TO HERE RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THESE THE HALLOWED WALLS OF CASTLE PARHAM
I have a dark secret
horror phase = me
0:45 Sonic the hedgehog was and still is my phase to this day sinse I was 9...
When I was 3, 4, 5, hmm maybe 8? Idk I was REALLY into cats and dogs. I just thought they were so cool and perfect that I would dress up as a cat and act like one. I would go outside with my dogs and one time I- well- did my business on a trashcan... like a dog... and I would go under the porch bc that's what my dogs would do. As you can see I was VERY chaotic
3:15 a mom with 2 kids mentality
How did all the food stay in place and not get messed up
Yeah, if I were in your dad’s position there, I would have been less forgiving of my significant other. I… Don’t do well with pranks.
My mom let me buy anything that I want and walk to the store
Me a9 year old and my cousion who is 18 🦄
Face reveal please TY
Bro I am actually thinking about running away
Her: I'm just having a picnic  Me: how can you eat and/or drink without a mouth?
Why do you always wear the same clothes when you are telling a story of when you were a kid
Becca’s mom: turned into the grinch
5:07 mother like daughter
KOPLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
I had a Dino faze
I used to play in a box win I was a kid I used to pretend the box was a space ship or a bot
Bagus animasi kamu otw aku dari Indonesia gomong gomong salam dari Indonesia

LOL! XD
All I have to say about this video is family is number one.
Why do her eyelashes keep disappearing
I really want to run away too. but I can’t
I tried to but I only got to the backyard
I'm in my "Fairybread phase" number 2691, and likely will be in it until 2691. *I won't even be alive then.*
4:17 You have to be really talented to draw an evil grin without actually drawing it.
I am still a kid
True I’m still at kid
Hehehe I’m a city kid its much easier but a much worse idea
How about a stuffed animal to
:&
Bru
You say you were wierd as a kid? You still are wierd what do you mean
I like your movies but I always put a mouse in it so why older people don’t have mouth
When I was a kid I wanted to make a movie and I’m still trying
When I was 7, I was so obsesed with Minecraft that somtimes I would just walk up to my friends and say: man Minecraft is cool. I changed… now Im obsesed with Animal crossing!
YouTube wooh
Can you please make more videos if you're dead alumina philippines
I go went though this Fase,here’s one of the memories I have about that! One day I was playing with my dad and I don’t know  what we were doing but we were playing and I grabbed my things and pretend to run away by garbing my backpack and packing my things and scootering down a circle sidewalk and stoping and pretending to place down a blanket and picking it up again and putting it in a room in my house and my dad acted like a ran away- it was fun but I don’t really know how it ended
Wen i was a kid i wanted to live the wild life and now i am going to stay inside for a long time....Bugs....
I did like ponies as a kid
Copyrighted from the Grinch how dare you
It’s so funny how her mom turned into the grinch
*When She's Done*  Me:Wow What a Nice Story OH Well Imma Call Your mOther That You Ran Away I gUees
I want to join you I love your videos
It is so sad your dad died
The start of the animation of becca allredy make it my sleep time a NIGHTMARE for the intire night of my life BUT,dreams are dreams ʘ‿ʘ

Love your videos
ive been stuck in a space phase for over 5 years :|
Dragon phase
I love that his first instinct is to blame the mom for her "running away"
You know you don’t go in the front yard all by yourself you can be taken away and never be seen again
Funny story related (kinda) to this:  As a lil girl I was always adventurous,I was like Finn From adventure time Running around Going to Stranger's houses (Don't worry those stranger's Knew my parent's and know where I live) and just Playing with whatever they have,One day while playing in my backyard my little self had this stupid idea of Running away to my cousin's place and if you don't know my cousin's place was pretty far from where I am...so I kinda went into this big Mission to get there before midnight,Granted as a kid I knew the problems that will happen to this situation but I honestly didn't care because lil me thought I could LITERALLY WIN A FIGHT WITH A STRANGER..... Yeah no there's many things lil me was wrong about,So after that I packed some kitkats and juice and went ahead with my adventure to my cousin's place (My house was also a restaurant but The worker's of my house didn't see me,My mom Was busy cooking and my dad was Delivering Bread so I was basically myself with a few of the kids of the staffs that live at my place) after what seems like two hours of walking I stumbled upon a small house that i didn't know who lives and There I saw a sweet granny and her Granddaughter,I stayed there for the whole Afternoon until I saw my aunt slowly driving pass by the small house,I don't know what little me thought but I'm pretty sure I was internally screaming seeing my aunt trying to Find me so for unknown reason I just bolted,I ran as fast as my little Legs could run and when I thought I was safe my aunt swoop me up and put me on the motorcycle she was on....long story short my mom And dad were Angry but also laughing they're asses of while I Try to do my best Fake crying,Lil me was such a good actor (not really)
I feel like a lot of families have that sixth love language. Including mine

0:37 WHERE DID THE STICK GO!?!?!

"it's not my problem how you get 426 pumpkin out here" ahem ma'am *what-*
Anyone else notice that every time we saw old Rachel some of the food was gone
ilivyourunningaway
When she opened the picnic in the opening where did she put the stick
hao ...did you fit u cack 12345678910
Nice story
I had a running away phase and I still do
I love it
:0 You were the kid that put hearts instead of the simple dots at the bottom of exclamation marks  I was the weird kid that instead of full stops I would put a ginormous circle and laugh my head off saying it was a grape. Ah I weird wonders of childhood
She had such good grammar when she was a kid!
0:12  ASMR
What was that about with the 426 pumpkins?
I once ran away from home and I just vibed at my friend's house for like an hour and my parents were furious
Mine was a Thomas the train faze technically it was Thomas and his friends faze
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
so were not just going to talk about the rustling in the bushes at the  end?
Where’d the stick go
I was the space face
Wait how she have a picnic with no mouth
Rachel is only two years older than you "Oldest child is supposed to know better"? You busted your mouth in your mouth accident video under your dad's care and he's an adult. And you expect your sister to "know better"?... way to shift the blame on her.  I highly doubt you did everything your older sister (by two years) told you to do, she's not your mom, I mean, who does.  Just saying.
Whoops!!!!! Thought you said latchkay! Which is a totally different thing.........
Amen JESUS died and rose again JESUS loves you so much JESUS  is coming back to save his children like me Spread the gospel like I just Did to make JESUS so happy Amen
She became a opera when she was screaming ö

Hi Rebecca para

I’m just saying my phase is comics
I don't know, but if your dad went to the bathroom first, it seemed a bit silly to me.I don't know, but if your dad went to the bathroom first, it seemed a bit silly to me because I mean you could be in danger! And in "first I go to the bathroom and then I look for Rebeca" or pordios what class!?
im in a banana fase
A thing I will never stop going through is a animal love especially dogs and foxes
Once I locked myself in the bathroom and played with my special teddy and then my mum walked in asking what I was doing but then I told her that Hahahhahahhahah I’m having my alone time leave me alone! And my voice it sounded like a little girl it was sooooooooooooOoOoOo annoying! >:))
Can you check out this video if you have not it’s called Gift For Rebecca Parhm (Let Me Explain Studios )I don’t think I spelt it correctly. By the way this video is not mine…
so I have a story and the same thing but a lot different so when I was four I was a evil evil child and I didn’t know what to do so I didn’t want to be my crazy family again so iPod prank on my mom and dad of leaving the house without permission so high right away and I know saying mommy and daddy I will never come back because I’m leaving I hope you like this if you don’t I love it I will be running away forever for mommy and daddy and the most and generating in part was that they thought I was actually gone but I was in the basement they never went to the basement so I just went to the basement it was so dark in there but I found the switch so I turned it on and unpacked my thing but they just had to do that they went to the basement and I was found and I was shivering I want to die like I was about to die I thought I was about to die so what’s the name of this is going to end tomorrow I will come back with part two of this OK😂🤣🤣😂
I mess with my family too ex.  My sister normally has her hair in a bun so me my 2 brothers and my dad would grab the bun gently and push her head forward and say vroom and up shift to a better mood

Not a running away story, but a story of a bad latchkey kid.  So apparently my dad would get home before either of his parents or siblings for like a good hour. And when he was home alone he /was not/ allowed in the pool, for obvious reasons. But this little shit would get in as soon as he got there, then get out about 20 mins before my grandma came home. He'd dry his hair and suit, put the suit back on and wait by the edge of the pool until she came home, then dive into the pool the moment she was in the backyard.  Honestly I'm amazed he's still alive.
I love dinosaur
G5
I am in a poppy playtime phase but I get  into new things one time and I get acted
0:25 her torture by Saying alot of things
I don't know why but I feel like this is your best video😭

Elvis phase
I ran away from home to another house caddy corner from our apartment at the time with only the Hocus Pocus VHS.
Your mom rocks sorry if that sounded dumd🤣🤣🤣
I had and still have a bfb and bfdi phase
reeeeeeeeeee!!
You you are not her real Channel you just been ripping her off all these times just to get more subscribers because you have so less subscribers in 2007 and I know what you know why you've done this you're done with this with all her friends and her
Damn. The adults in your neighberhood(how do you spell that!?) are WAY more caring than the ones where i live.
Becca, it’s true  I use to have that feeling of running away fase. And I’m still in 3rd grade 😂
How did you bite in that sandwich-
I love the detail that the food around her is actually being eaten
I like how the mom had a grinch face 🤣🤣🤣
For those of you who cant read the note- Dear Mom and Dad, I ran away from home to find my own life. I will build my own house and find my own food. I will find a job and get some money. Don’t worry about me and pit up signs that say have you seen me. I will come and visit you. You can come and visit me to. I will give you my address when I find it. Love Rebecca (Edit-Omg this is so cute 🥺🥰)
1:50 oh uh I guess I was a stupid kid *someone who actually tried running away on a regular basis*
The grich part was BEAUTIFUL
The fact she can fold food into a blanket without messing up the food or the blanket tells you how powerful of a witch she is
the weirdest obsession i have ever get  was with beavers
My phase as a kid was eating quesadillas on a taco night
7:46 YOU COULDVE ATLEAST TAKEN THE CAKE
I’m still in my space faze!
i think people say that kids shouldn't go out by themselves is because... 1. their memory is horrible and might forget their way home 2. since kids are dumb they can meet people they dont know. they could be selling drugs or worse and kids would listen to them.
Haha, what if all the weird stuff that’s been happening in her videos lately has been the ghost of Nacie?
“— I don’t think we’ve ever stopped going through phases.” Glad to know I’m not the only one 😅
7:02 I’ll buy that for 300$
yes
OH MY GOD that was so funny I 😂😂😂😂😂😂LOL
PFFFFFFFFF HAHAHAHAH😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Honestly a lot of weird stuff happened to you when you were little
That was funny when her dad and her screaming 🤣🤣🤣
It’s funny when her dad noogies her! 😂
It’s just a prank bro
Holy shit I thought I was the only one  When I was like 7-8 I would try running away CONSTANTLY I was just so upset and I can't even remember over what  There's like 3 times I vividly remember trying to run away  as I grew up I realized I was lowkey neglected and then things started clicking as to why I was upset enough to run away 💀💀💀  I would literally try and run away just to get love from my mom 😭
I love the grinch reference
My price is a try
Anyone live in Canada 🇨🇦 ( Toronto ) that is willing to run away together - I'm 14/a girl/I'm from 🇳🇬 ( living in an abused family household ) and I don't think I can stay here any longer
A wholesome touch to a previously silly joke. Now this is a prank done right.
hello rebecca i'm a brazilian fan of yours i'm 13 i love two stories i don't know english i'm using a translator sorry my bad english
What the heck another Rachel
The fact that she shows her face in some videos she’s pure Beatfull
Y’know, come to think of it, I also had that childhood sensation of “running away” with that EXACT handkerchief on a stick as my luggage!.
True story I'm one of my friends run away
girl your face is so pretty!!
I never left my pony phase man there’s nothing wrong with that tho there’s a good story okay?
Im still going through a fase and it's anime

True!you are my favorite utuber and i try to watch all of some of the videos on time but this is my favourite

𝓞𝓸𝓸𝓸𝓸𝓸
I had a frog phase and never came out of it
if you think about it, its more weird to be perfectly, completely normal with nothing out of the ordinary about you than to be "weird".
When I was 3rd grade I was the  like you
It's just me or Rebecca looks like lauren from laurenzside
A happy family!
Hehehwheheheheheheheh
Hahahahahahahahahahah
anime
Hello rebeca my name is Anthony mais eu so br

I really liked running away when I was little but I would hide under my trampoline outside
Hah . My parents did this with my younger siblings .

"I was weird not stupid*     Me: I was not smart when I was in clalamont school.
It was funny
Hi it's me Jacob I'm really interested to zombie films and zombie games and stuff like that
I could never get the blanket bag on a stick thing to work, but my "running away" story involved my three year old self packing a little suitcase full of toys and leaving it by the front door. When my mom asked where I was going, I parroted her often-made response to that very question: "crazy. Wanna come?".
I had a plush phase
Hahaha
I had a simaller idea to running away when I was younger
i feel so bad for your dad i’d never forgive myself
Where did the stick go nobody will know
I'm in my phase and it's...           Getting stranded and surviving on a deserted island -_-
I love how you made your character book it behind the bushes as soon as you heard a noise.
My family messes with each other all the time. We always call each other names, and not the usual pet names. We always use more hurtful names. For example my mom is a little overweight and my dad always calls her fat ass. But it's all fun and games for us. Although with the way we somtimes talk to each other people who don't know us would think we hate each other.
Who isn’t weird we’re all weird And proud of it to
Why the heck do you need 426 pumpkins placed in the woods
4:00 Becca's mom is too smart for that nonsense.  She must've made her "Running Away" phase obvious.
Rebecca: i was… wierd… Me: “hey my glasses!…” “wait…”
I remember as a 5yr old I was at my grandmas house and it was raining I opened my grandmas door took my toys with me a ran away my grandma was sleeping when I ran away I thought I could find my parents house on my own and it was raining hard and I remembered how to find my grandmas house and l was laying on the couch where I was watching tv

I love this video how many stories do you have
I really like your videos but I don't think I will ever be able to see you because I live in Australia and I am 8 years old and my name is Ryeot
I just lost a tooth while watching this
The fact that Mama Parham did her... "neccesities" in the kitchen... was... interesting... 3:43
It is ok I'm also a weird kid
Omg!!! I just loved the grinch!!!😊😌😙
———h——
My phase was geography

Your Family sounds fun to live with. R.I.P Becca's Dad also, when are we gonna see your Brother and Sister on camera, we've already seen your mum, so now I want to see them too?
Becca: We all go through phases Me currently in my Genshin Impact/minor weeb phase with plenty more coming: Yeah that's accurate

O
Love your vids
A slice was gone from the cake at the end of the video…
I have no plan of running away especially because I am comfortable at home you might not, good bun but you should spend a little more time with your parents at least
I put one of our tents on the balchony and said I refused to come back home because I ran away lmao
6:18
How did you eat at the picnic could you have no mouth you can't eat and if you can't eat you die so how are you not dead 😂😂😂
When she said, "Lock myself in the bathroom," I thought she said lock myself in the backroom(s)
You have beautiful voice for singing
In 0:35  Wait what happen to the stick 😶😶😶
Ok ok, when I was 7 or 6 I actually did think of running away, I packed my backpack full of food and supplies. But I never actually did it because I am a scardey cat. TvT     :>

I also went through the running away phase. I tried only twice. Once I only made it to our next door neighbors driveway but the other I made it all the way to the baseball diamond that was about ten minutes away from my house
If I was younger me and my sister would do this. I'm a grat actor.
Reminds me of when I used to play “bomb shelter” as a kid. It pretty much just consisted of me taking all of my favorite toys into a Disney Princess tent and… sitting in silence for a while.
Oh, this is a quirky youtuber with over 3 mil-WAIT WHAT THE FU-
🤗love at the same w w w w a result in a good time for a while to😁😁

For me I had a pony phase and now I have duck bc I’m still a kid and I was 6 when I liked pony’s and now I’m older and I’m 8 now when I made this comment and now I luv ducks😀
I actually tried running away when I was , idk, 13? I was pretty old but not enough to drive. I packed up my stuff in my backpack, told my parents I was leaving, which they didn’t believe I would get anywhere, and went on my way on my bike. Up a giant hill. For at least 10 minutes until my mom came over in her truck and drove me back home. XD
I’m In my “Let Me Explain Studios” phase and I will NEVER get out of this phase.
The end kinda scared me a little bit bc I was expecting a jump scare

This story was so wholesome ^^
I ate popsicle while listening 🤤
I take walks by myself all the time it’s amazing
My brain is going all over the place, cause I have two sisters named Rebcca and Rachel, but Rachel is the youngest. So it's weirdly surreal hearing there are Rachel's who are.....'older'
y'know what i'm gonna finish her sentence "Thank you so much for tuning in but now i gotta tune out"
I actually ran away once when I was nine in the middle of the night Two hours before school, and got five splinters. The next day I left again, but onto to grab the suitcase I left behind a Bush perfectly hidden at mid-day. A nice women found me and asked if I was alright and called the police. THe police let me grab my Suitcase and the drove me back home. I only left to make my older brother happy because he hated me because I was annoying.
aww the ending is so wholesome 🥲
the part when her dad found her in the shower I was eating my fries and drinking my coke and I laughed when that part happend it made me laugh alot😃

BUT MOM AND DAD DIDN'T KNOW THAT. Anyways I have always had a rebecca parham phase
hi
ok so i never went though a faze instead which is a “faze” i loved to watch bloody films I STILL LOVE BLOOD AND “CREEPY” DOLLS TO DIS DAY😎
I did the same thing when I was 5 years old i used to pretend to be leaving my house
I wonder if your dad was really going to the bathroom take a moment to let himself fully panic/cry before going to put on a brave face, to focus fully on finding you
I used to have a phase where i was obsessed and i mean OBSESSED with queen victoria, and because im autistic that phase didn't top until i was 14, when it started at 8. but i think there may still be a tiny bit of that phase still in me.
And now I want to run away to the bathroom and pertend that the bathroom is my small house in the woods.🤣
I have the sixth one 2
Once I traded to leave home , I susceded and never did it again I cried for like 30 mins although it thought. Like 3 hours . I sat at the local park and cried
The famous grinch smile!!
7:19 same
If your are wondering what the "daycare" it's a story for another day.
Rebeca: why are you have that bag ? Me: how did you say that  😳 Me also: tries so hard to say it
The pony fhace pony was Apple Jack from My little pony
I like that the abrupt ending was a little bit of foreshadowing to one of her next videos about fears
i did that when i was like 6
XD this is funny
Nah I was thinking of taking a massive shit of a 20 foot balcony to land on a bald mans head
It was more of a game rather than personal issues. Just for fun!

Wait it’s real
when I was a kid, I got to go outside by myself is that normal???.........

Whenever this one friend would come over to my house we’d pretend to be homeless in a toy house in my backyard. We’d get a bowl of popcorn and two tiny chairs and id pretend to be a starving musician with a ukelele i got for my birthday (and didnt jnow how to play). It was tons of fun lol

I love your taste!!!!
Does anyone know jaiden animations they would be like besties
Did you realise the food on the picnic kept getting eaten the more the video went on
I feel you. I loved Lady and the Tramp 2 and the Little mermaid movies. So I wanted to be like the main characters and also run away from home. But after I "ran away" for about an hour I ran back home for a snack. 😆😂 I don't know why 6 year old me run away empty handed.
Grinch reference.
*You*ahhhhhh!!!!!!!!
What did she run away from at the end
Rebecca Your skill is amazing 🤩 i love your videos u make a bad day great 😊
So funny that your mom helped😂😂

That's just SUS😑
The subject of mine when I was young was GUNS, WAR AND DEATH
0:24 - 0:34
I love how the food keeps on disappearing little by little! Rebecca puts so much detail in her videos!
Dude I was literally in 3rd grade when I tried running away to the neighbors house, but instead they called the police on me
my pony "phase "  has been going on since i was 5 years old and i'm still watching mlp to present day (i was actually watching a mlp video earlier today)
Her sniff: Oh boy seen y’all AAAaaAaAH
Let’s talk about on how entertaining Rebecca’s videos are, and still are.
Wait a minute you don't have a nose so you will have to eat through your eyes
I was weird too
My siblings and I went through a phase when we were little where we literally tried to run away. We never got out the door but I remember all off us sneaking toward the door late at night with backpacks. We always got caught luckily.

Rebecca: Mom...? Did you read the letter? Mom: Oh, look. It came back.

Becca had better handwriting back when she was a kid than the people in my high school today, no exaggeration I can't read some of my friends papers because of it.
I love it when you say my lilltle oololliys
LOL I’m still going through my happy tree friends face
Breaking news I ate a cookie with mashed potatoes and gravy with hamburger fun fact it was ok 😂😂
The starter i was saying many times like faster
I actually tried to run away at the ripe age of 7! I was physically abused by my older brother, mentally tormented which later developed as an anger issue of mine and flinches to as small as lifting your hand. It was night and I was packing my items in a bag I had filled with snacks and a bottle of water, luckily before I even went to the door my nanny catches me leaving, honestly I didn't know what I was thinking back then really.
I remember me running away to find my mom when she had only gone to my gramma's house and I only walked like 20 m away from my house and started crying and people walking in streets were like - what is that child doing? I had a really bad memory so, I couldn't find my way back and then, a lady came by and asked me for my name and being the oblivious child, I gave her my name and told what had happened and she said that she knew my mom and she'd help  me to find her, at that very moment my aunt came running to me screaming. I don't remember what she was screaming though. It happens that the lady who was taking me back to my mom was actually walking me in the opposite direction from where my house was. My aunt picked me up and walked to the house. I ran to my mom and hit my mouth on a glass panel and broke my other upper front baby tooth. I looked like and old lady with no teeth. My mom started laughing. I had to go to the dentist again. It was the worst thing that's happened to me so far. I was only five. I consider that running away...kinda : D
In the picnic she took a bite in the sandwich without a mouth 😂😂😂
me too
your SOOOOOO good at singing (although we only heard you singing for 5 seconds)😄😄

I said I would get my own apartment when I was like 5 when I said I was going to run away ;-;
I was in the *Space phase* 3 years ago… I’m still in the space phase…
The background in the forest is so pretty
I like that Rebecca's animations are starting to be more on the cartoon logic side and I like how creators never lose that retro side.
I love how the food progressively got eaten 😆
she said a jojo reference
Interesting and cool vid.
shehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I had a dora phase from when I was 6 to when I was 10
*My brother ran away once and almost got kidnapped from the most deadliest murders in the world, luckily my oldest brother saved him and brought him too safety*
REBECAAAAAAA YOU DIDN’T FINISH THE CAAAAAAAAKE
obviously not a coyote. coyotes always get hurt when finding food everyone knows that
Ya see, I don’t really have phases as much as patterns. I stick to music, then move toward games (when a new one is released), then hardy potter, then Pokémon Go, then Music, then games, then Harry Potter, Pokémon go, ETC.
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜💜🖤🤎💗 Rainbow hearts
5:20 I have to say that's what my dad probably says when I'm in my room half the day on my tablet 🤭🤔🤭🤔🤭

You need a mouth or you will have to eat food through your nose 🤣
Call 911 i stub my toe
2:52 care to explain about the eaten sandwich? REBECCA?
Finally a face reveal yayy
Your'e Just The Same As Odds1Out
I had a bendy phase
YOOOOO I WAS THE WEIRD KID TO AND RUNNING AWAY!!!!
I am an only child, so I hatched a plan with my mom when I was about 6 years old. I would hide and when my dad came home from work, my mom would be inconsolable at the fact that I ran away and talk my dad into having another child. Then I would pop out from behind the couch and be the best big sister ever. I didn't know much about how babies were made back then.
Oh yeah about those phases, the phase I'm going through right now and probably for the rest of my life is my SCP Foundation phase
im still on that face the runing away lol
I have a question, im  11 (a starter at animating) what software do you reccomend to animate that is free of cost?
The part where you and your dad started screaming at each other 🤣 I also felt bad for your dad at the same time 🤗🥺🥰
When she flat out the picnic blanket: where did the stick go?
I love that the grinch smile still feels like it when she doesn’t even have a mouth
To be honest once me and my siblings got kicked out by my rude stepdad my mum couldn’t do anything bc our stepdad was a bit abuseive to mum and we went to our nans house after we got there we knocked on the door and nan let us in and asked us what happend and now the girls live with mum alone and i live with nana i see mum alot
0:10 Becca the scene with a mysterious vague on a stick.  0:36 Sets up the yummy picnic.  1:15 A few grapes were missing.  1:42 Drinking/Holding a teacup 🍵   2:14 Drinking/Holding a glass of lemonade🍋, also a small bite of one of the grilled cheese🧀🥪 slices is confirmed.  2:48 Holding up the sandwich slice with the nibble of a bit.  3:07 Confirmed: Rebecca wolfed it down less than a second by the power of toon.  4:01 The other slice of grilled cheese 🧀🥪 and the rest of the grapes 🍇 likely now sit in Rebecca's stomach.  5:29 The apple 🍎 was quickly consumed to its core another sip of tea.  6:23 While making a call for 426 pumpkins 🎃, a slice of cake 🍰 is consumed, plus a sip of tea🍵.  7:44 Becca runs away from the picnic due something in the bushes. Who shall finish off the cake, the lemonade 🍋, banana🍌, and the rest of the tea🍵?  Me: I'll definitely eat finished off the rest of the cake and lemonade 🍋 is always good. Though I would probably leave the tea 🍵 and banana 🍌 for someone else.   (I prefer banana muffins, no nuts 🥜 please, and I only l like tea🍵 by crystal light.)
Bro i remember when i was very young, i would just get up in the morning, get dresses and all that, and go outside to just play with the neighbors. My father would yell at me each time and i never learned. I might've played Skylanders before i went out, but whatever. This other time, i remember having to really go to the bathroom (number 2). So, i had the bright idea to do it outside in my backyard. I had a lot of neighbors at the time and probably everyone saw me. I had no regrets that moment
I'm werd to 🥴           That's really 😐
6:11 I was laughing so hard I almost died
You’re a mean one ms. Parham
0:59 am a 17 yr old in a jojo phase, can confirm
Honestly all of us were weird as a kid

I love the way you draw your pigtails on little Becca it's so cute!  Also, I did run away from home once . I wanted to go to my Grandma's house.
Talking about phases, have you ever been through a scene phase
Becca: Oh Becca why do you have that hancerchief bag on a pole that was POPULARIEZED IN THE 1970'S AS A WAY TO SHOW THE GREAT DEPRESION...?

How does she have service in the middle of a forest that's is most likely from a storytale
love the videos very uncomfortable by the intro but i know its unique and others like it but ooda lol le i just dont like personally
one time when i was like 7 i pretended like i was gonna run away and packed a bag and put my "pet" snail in a jar. i got two steps down my street and then dropped the jar with the snail then accidently  stepped on it. truly tragic, that poor snail and i never did have the chance become famous.

Actually I would do the exact same phase as you? didn’t we all? I’m not sure but I know I did
The grinch references are perfect
Honestly, it was probably better that he found you sooner. While funny, it could've gotten too mean really quickly
6:14 it sounds like a cod zombie
its not a mistake ITS A MASTER PIECE
I ran away for a whole week ( I packed my own food and some water) and my parents legit did not care when I eventually came back it was like  "Uh hi mom.." "Hi, can you go dust please" "ಠಗಠ"
2:20 T-pose
I haven’t YET gone through more than 5 phases. First 6 years = DINOSAURS. 1 month = STAR WARS. My entire life but not really = marvel. Now = DINOSAURS CARCHARODONTOSAURUS

Anime
This is the perks of being tall they won’t think you’re a kid
I loved dogs and know a lot of them
That was a tipo
My mom would have done the same thing Lol
Are you friends with Bryson from haminations?
😈🌳

I’m a kid
I wanna say something but I don’t know what to saaaaaaay, soooooooooo… *very happy mushroom dance*
6:24 I only just realized that this part was referring to Rebecca’s video in her treehouse when she told the story about the mad musician
That was so me as a kid!!
Girl I'm an artist like you and i believe all artists have bad handwriting so don't worry you are not alone🙃
I already watched this then I came backthebn I was about to click off then the picnic THEN I STAYED
I love your videos!!!
What about the food the food people 😭😭
I was a weird kid too
I think I have a phase phase I constantly obsess over different things
i had a history phase and still in it
All YouTubers we're weird
Se dry if wet mr en MMB dry NM and warm up and floor in a student having the best 5th of every month and the only thing that I have a movie is the whole thing that is a little bit more than the first time we had to do this ❤ 💙 ♥ 💗 😀 💕 ❤ 💙 ♥ 💗 😀 💕 ❤ 💙 ♥ 💗 😀
in third grade I actually came up with the idea at school to run away from home I would get my friends and head to Macdonalds it was eight ò clock and I put all of my plushies into a shape of a human I jumped out my window got on my scooter and made a run for it. My parents freaked at this they called all of their friends and the police. I was like 50 metres from my destination and the police found me I look back at the event three years ago that I was quite a smart nine year old it was stupid but the decisions I made were just genius I crossed a train track and I more but I think the cutest part was when I stopped at the gas station in my pjs 😂
The fact she Running way
Going through a phase right now with guns
I'm shocked she has a letter.
Omg I had so many bad gases when I was little, such as me and my brother only getting in our underwear,and tried to survive in our backyard, my bro once ate a wasp.Another time in preschool we all had the plan that at night we would sneak out of our houses, and head to it.None of us had the guts but one girl,who got locked outside for an hour.
Sonic faze
4:17 I love how she made her do the same smile that the Grinch did in How The Grinch Stole Christmas lol
I had a phase of liking Toothless, a nightfury from How to train your dragon. (and i still do..)
I have a faze with anime
When I was a kid I had a tec fase
I know like how
I really like letmeexplainstudios cuz anytime I have a really hard day all I love doing is turning on my tablet and watching it she's never failed to make me laugh she is definitely one of favorite YouTubers
Her:ha kids run swaying to a house in the woods   me:but you did
Just bye seeing the title I just knew this was gonna be relatable
Lets see fnaf phase,my little pony phase,emo phase and stay at bedroom phase
Mama has a wonderful awful idea let's get your dad. After that face I was just like oh God the Grinch face appears.
You kind of look and sound like DOCTOR SQUISH
She had a very bad idea
Mine is robotics

"You're thinking: '[gasp] Becca, why do you have that handkerchief bag on a pole commonly referred to as a bendel that was popularized in the 1930s as a way to represent the impoverished migrant workers of the Great Depression? Are you running away?'" -Rebecca Parham, 2021
I like how the food gets eaten up every time it shows Rebecca
Me who had a slender tubby phase:
My mom would have started crying and freaking out
Im in my robloz phase and im ten
I went through a skylanders phase in 2012 to 2017 the reason to 2017 was for the one year before giants the second game that I missed I still have a boatload of characters and toy
Her stories are always so wholesome, I appreciate them
I am in my strategy, nausea and history phase

You're my favorite YouTuber Rebecca

Your dad is funny sorry he died😭😭😭😭😭😭💀
do you want a kid boy or girl  and i Love  the one where you ran away from home.
When I was a kid, I was quite petty when I was angry at my mom. So I would write a note, threatening my mother with running away and sticking that note between my door then wait…my mom wasn’t amused.😅
I think for some phases were just adhd/add/dave
My life is a car and dinosaur phase
4:20 the Grinch is real! Is Rebecca's mom
I had a dinosaur phase A unicorn One under space one
that grinch face 4:20
i hade one a tom and jerry phase
7:21 Dont all of our families have this love language? Mine does.
I think when I was around seven I had an axolotl phase like eight months  (or more i still have it)
What you shouuld have done: Hide in his closet until he goes to sleep. Transform yourself into an animatronic. Wait till he gets up at (whenever he gets up), and give him the good old Five Nights at Freddy's Jumpscare: Jump out at him while making a metallic screaming noise
1:29 Whats that thing called please help meee
Thing I need is mentioned in the vid name 🙄
Last time I saw this it said 34 mins ago and NOW it’s 2 hole months ago!!!!!!!!
Bruh forgot about you 😂
Lol
My family has 7 signs of love; messing with each other, and cursing each other
my only phase is VIDEO GAMES REEEEEEEEEEEE
when i was elevan i lovvvved attack on titan
I loved running away stories as a kid. I still do.
My dinosaur phase still hasn't grown out. And it won't until the sun comes down for the last time.
I’m just waiting for the woods lore to come together—
Hi Becca! I'm your fan! I speak Spanish but I try to understand your videos. I never made a joke to my parents but I know that you are rebellious and you will have told them many more than they can tell.
6:16 I love how cute she is
She knows about i am selling for derection
Your not the only one who has the thing to running away
oh my god
I just found this channel your animations are cool
Was there any child ever who is not absolutely weird and crazy?
This is like Haminations
I have a war Face
Your mom is the Grinch
Mine face is so gun face
4:11
6:53 Holy sh*t girl, my handwriting didn't get better until I was like 15
I'm 10 but I can't walk home alone because the people zoom trough 8th street, putting my life at risk
what family DOESN'T have the 6th love language of messing with each other?
Dude, I’m still in the MLP phase! How did Rebecca predict this? Is she psychic? (By the way, Rainbow Dash is my favorite)
I ran away once (guaranteeing u I never did it again)
Squirtle Squad
i know how you feel i go to daycare after school to <3
Does a thieving phase count? Know that I think about it I don’t think anyone needs to know about that one
I remember when I and my brother were about 6 or 7 we planned to run away. but we told our parents about it but my dad didn't care much cause he knew we weren't going to do it. he started telling us that if we do then the police would arrest us and we will stay In jail forever. and like the little kids we were we believed it and stayed home
Hi baby 😩
So much as changed
My phase was actually an "Elsa" phase and I wouldn't stop talking about it😂 FUN FACT: It lasted for, like, three years 😅 😬
kid becca has better handwriting han me lol
0:56 im stuck with spaceflight phase probably until i watch your video about dress code   Which is the videk that make me subcribe to you and enter animation phase(maybe thats a thing)

YOU ARE INCREDIBLE !!!!!! SO FUNNY , CUTE , CRAZY AND SO ME!!!!! I STARTED Watch Your vídeos 19/11/21 and OMGGGGG YOU ARE MAGICAL

Hi Rebecca I'm a fan can I have a Shout Out please🤗
The backgrounds in this is amazing
Oh, I also do prank my family in a loving way! It’s really funny to do to my dad. Me VS my dad. What could go wrong?
4:45 BAHAHAHHAHAHAA! Edit: 6:15 is pretty funny too.
Becca: I know what you’re thinking, and I’ll tell you why I brought this stick with cloth. You see, it was a nice day out and who wouldn’t want to go out and have a picnic-  Me: With all due respect madam, when I first saw you, I marveled at the beautiful outfit you’re wearing! I adore just about anything you draw yourself in, and who knows if you were part of my inspiration to create my own style of fashions? And while I do agree that it is an impeccable morn today, I swear if you don’t open up a fashion line someday, my life will 👏🏾HAVE 👏🏾NO 👏🏾MEANING!  I paused to write this at the start. Continuuue. 😅
I liked how in some specific part this video completes the next one.
Your mom probably figured out that tour weren't really gone. Probably hiding somewhere in the house or the backyard and you had no real intention of actually running away. Who knows maybe she went through the same phase as a kid. Weirdness must run in the family
Hello I’m 9 :)
heh the bathroom
LOL😂😂🤣🤣
Is no one gonna talk about her singing “aint’cha” at the start
BROMITA haha
The many pumpkins she ordered where for her next video.
6:24 Yooooo are those the pumpkins from your halloween video?? :0
Did you really scream when your dad caught you in the bathroom?! Think your mom wanted to mess your dad for one reason or another
Hi Rebecca, I speak Spanish, so I'm going to speak badly. I quite identify with you, which is why I'm your fan and I hope you have much more success because your videos have a lot of work, a lot of quality, I love you
still stuck in my dinosaur phase .. can you tell?
I went from her Halloween video to this video and was so delighted and impressed by all the details in this video that lead into the Halloween one.

How does a cake mess up
Can I have a sandwich 🥪

I LOVE how the child going through a Space Phase is a Girl! <3   ALSO: Rebecca? A weird child?! IS EVERYTHING I KNOW A LIE?! T_T JK  It all makes perfect sense
0:34 Rebecca:Do you think I'm running away? Me: Well no, you're an adult now, not a child. That's not running away, that's just leaving.
Were the hell did the stick go??????
Sometimes, I wonder if you actually live in a tree house, or it is just for the character's scenario, pretty much all the videos you've made till' now, have the same Lore Alone in a house separated from society, in the middle of the woods, hearing creepy sounds all the time your mind trying to trick you into seeing strange figures around the house So creeply interresting...               YES, I AM AWAITING FOR A VIDEO OF YOU TRYING TO FIND THESE THINGS
“I will give you my address when I find it.” is the funniest thing only a child can come up with
I like your guys's videos because you guys are cartoon characters
I like your guys's videos because you guys are cartoon characters
I think I like you James and James friend I don't remember her name
MOM: *😎*
Oh those vicious squirrels  Stand aside, coyotes, where were you when Mark Rober hit 5 mil
well. Now the video doesn't feel finished.
I never went through a faze 😂
What a MOM! That’s hilarious!
How does she have enough time to put so much raw, pure EFFORT into these?! Like wow.. Good job!! 👏👏
Oo
6:16 "hippity hoppity your trial of hiding has expired"
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love the somewhat subtle Grinch reference
I am no loli
0:50  Me with ADHD and Autism: haha yeah just as a child  definitely
4:16 grinch but no smile.
I'm still on my running away phase
Appel jack
I like how the food slowly witherd away
hahaha
now what i'm thinking is why are you not posted in 5 months and then 1 month and know you finally posted 2 days ago
Wow
I will tell you the address after building myself a home? Umm, wait so is she building a house or squatting in an abandoned house? Make up your mind kid! No wonder your mum figured out it wasn't real.
i sometimes do that really weird formal royal voice sometimes
I doesn't feel like its been a month
Possibly my strangest phase was my prey mantis phase
as a kid i think my phase was about.... crime....
When is she going to make another video? I love her videos😍😍😍😍
ur mum is funny
You are awesome
I have a pokemon phase.
I almost ran away when I was 10 yrs old now that I think about it it's been a long time since then so I'm glad I did not run away .

Why is Rebecca's family so amazing!? 😭
I had a faze with fnaf
Your mom and sister are E L I T E I'm like ♪～(´ε｀ )♪～(´ε｀ )
There’s these kids in my town that run away, like, every other week. At first it was concerning, but now it’s like “They ran away again.” “Really? That’s five minutes early.”
Ngl I don't like YouTubers that don't even say anything or do anything to there comments but with u it's ok to do it
i ran away like 4 times but only for a few hours, my parents were having an 'argument' and me running away was the only way to stop them, and make them agree on something (finding me)
I never actually got to running away from home. I just kinda packed up bags and put them by my window, and than my parents told me to clean them up
I can't stop laughing at mamma had a wonderful awful idea!!!!!!! That was great!!!
I ran away and almost got kidnapped 👌😀✌️
0:37 who..what???how did the lemon guis NOT SPILT!!!!
I used to have a human evolution phase
TW: Me and my friends at the church I went to also used to play the game “running away” and this is how it always went: Ok so- our parents d!3d a while ago (mind you we were like- 4-10 coming up with this) and we were living with our grandparents. They were very mean and would h*rt us- yah. It gets dark. And so it was us running around my friends’s house and- IT WAS EVEN DARKER AT THAT POINT. WE WERE GETTING BIT BY SNAKES AND D!3ING. yah- I would like to apology on behalf of my younger self.
Happy Halloween! 🖤💜

Hi Rebecca, how old are you?
Sometimes I don’t want to be
Oiii
Once I started a fire at school I'm 4 parallel universes ahead of you
I also went through a "running away" phase, I'd pack a poorly done bag and set off. One day my mom was frustrated and said fine go away. So I did.  I packed my bag, climed over the baby gate on the porch and walked off. I made it half way down the street before my mom finally realized I actually walked off
I want to be a ghost story
Rebecca: boop bee dodo Betty boop: YOU ARE TRULY A QUEEN UWU
I LOVE YOUR ANIMATION VERY GOOD I AM FROM BRAZIL AND I THINK YOUR CHANNEL IS VERY COOL
2:27 I can relate because I've just started Year 6 in England and with that I've started walking home by myself, but I haven't got a key yet.
Hey Rebecca maybe you should do a collaboration with James a Janisse from dead meat
6:11 you guys should see it
I ever run away bruh when I'm going to like feeling alone I go to my room a
I actually ran away but came back the next day but they did not even notice I am an only child
YES, I was obsessed with the idea of running away. I always challenged my brother with challenges like “who can stay in the bathroom for the longest” or sum sheet. I would stay there  all night. One time I tried to run away, from the downstairs window, and I camped in the garden for 3 hours, eating leaves.
happy 3M
I’m going through my Muppets/Jim Henson phase right now
WHAT ALL OF THOSE VIDEOS STORIES WAS TRUE !! WOW 😳
Me quedé sin pata
Rebecca Parham just to let you know I love your videos because they're so exquisite they make me laugh they make me smile to to see you and yourself getting along I hope you have a great rest of your year
As a kid I once threatened to run away and my parents said 'go ahead' assuming I was just being a mood bag and wouldn't do anything like most kids but then they got mad at me when I actually took their advice and managed to walk down the road for about an hour until they caught up to me and freaked out at me even though i told them what i was gonna do and they endorsed it. Mixed signals much?
Wonderful awful idea a Grinch reference
I love let me explain studios
do you speak Spanish
I love your videos
No way is YouTube let's go
I go to school by myself and go home by myself so that is pain for my legs😫😫🥱

I went through an art phase when I was 8. It never stopped. #artlife
I “ran away” from home once. I just ran down the road with my neighbor friend and we heard a dog bark and I tripped so we went back up to her house and made up as story on how I tripped on there steps to her sister. And she believed it. I thin
I wish I had parents that had this sense of humour and that loved me for being a weirdo
0:40, 0:58, 1:17, 1:41, 1:59, 2:15, 2:26, 2:50, 3:09, 4:02, 4:26, 5:29, 6:26, 7:32 Every picnic cutaway because looking at the different scenes in chronological order shows just how detailed of an artist Becca is

R- Rebecca? Rebecca yoU LEFT THE PICNIC
If you can or want to at red mountain high school on Arizona we are doing noises off if you want to come and sre
The fact that you’re one of the fewer animators that has a beautiful complete heckin forest background or other stuff like that instead of just a white void is really something I like about this channel
i had a sleep in the woods by myself yeah cops wher involved that is all i will say
OK
What are you doing
Can somebody explain to me the last scene when she walked away when she heard a sound? Was it a bear or something? ?
Muito bom adorei kkkk
Oi seu brasileiro
Hey that's the pumpkin guy
I had this phase too. It was more of a threat than a fun game, though. Like, whenever i didn’t want to do something my parents told me to, i would say i was going to run away. Kids are awful, huh?
I once packed all my barbies in my suit case and took a walk down the road for no reason I just wanted to take them for a walk which is very strange-
I’m weird to everyone in my family but my mom and dad is weird and my friends and my cousin everyone is weird. Also I like being weird and normal is boring.
Make another video about daycare story
THE QUEEN HAS UPLOADED

Hi Becca!
Rebecca Parham is the best story teller
Parem ARG anyone?
Whatsup!
Dag
When i was a kid, I wasn't just a weird kid, i was a creepy kid.:b, still am just older.•^•, but the phase was max when I was little, these were the years before I knew what actually happens behind the scenes within aphmau, and lil kid + knowing yandere simulator, (also the years knowing what happened behind the scenes), means yandere kid, and it latched onto my brain, shortly after I got my vampire phase and simping phase.(still attached to my brain.•^•), but the most likely one was the moment like "i wanna kill travis.•^•" moments, luckily the dude was a character and the voice actors for him was no where near my town and hense myself, cuz I was legit serious those years.•^•, it started when i found what zanvis was, and like the lil zane yandere i was, it was like a volcano if someone upsetted zane or was thinking about getting together with him, and I happend to watch, and then boom that yandere is 18 years old with anxiety and most likely depression and still a simp for vampires and characters.•^•, its just unlimited now cuz I realized i simp for girls and non-binary ones too.•^•
Still as good as ever
You helped me to feel better and not cry myself to sleep
Actually I was thinking about ur upload schedule....sorry
I was so scared something was going to pop out at the end
oh no oh no oh no no no no no
Idfk how to explain this but… your face like matches your voice 💀
=O good prank on your parents and i was so worried when you went to the shower that you can be seen im so so scared cus i may be hurt but nope

I ran away once, it was so dumb, i didn't even have shoes on, The reason i ran away?         I broke the school computer. I was found 10 minutes later.
Why don't you make more  videos  😥😥😥😥😩😭😭😭
I know why animators say they were weird as a kid because they need stories to tell 🧐🧐
05:01 Like mom, like daughter! 😆
That ending was very creepy! is the rustling in the  bushes supposed to be the garden witch?
When I was a kid I had a dinosour phase
I know you probably won’t see me but do you have any tips for someone that wants to be a animator like you
Rebecca:I was a weird kid Me:I think everyone was or is a weird kid because everyone is weird in there own way
Okay why was I actually scared at 4:17 😐😂😂
My brain is still a gaming brain
Yes she’s back I missed her videos so much
I bet rebbeca turns into a vampire lol
Tô entendendo nada vou esperar um canal aqui dublar kkkk
The amount of talent it takes to do the Grinch Smile™️ without a mouth-
Rebecca I was just watching jaiden animation when she did a nuzlocke and I thought Rebecca had a old video of butterfree fighting a trainer and it would be cool if you did a nuzlocke
How do you fit all that food🍮🥧🍭🧁🍫
I love how his dad just open the the shower door and start screaming
Bruh
I never had this phase. Though when I was younger, my brother & I would pretend we were runaways since we constantly got muddy.  Edit: I had a Monster High phase when I was 10
I wanted to run away a lot during my senior year.  This was the school year that my mom had a working car for the same amount of time I was going to school in person (I'm class of 2021).  At least once, I had a night where I went home to my bedroom, called my mom, and tried to have her pick me up from my house, so I could spend a day at her house away from my sucky life.  She said no, and I'm still upset that I didn't have more control of my life in that situation.  I mean, I was a senior.  How come I still don't have a driver's license?  If I'd gotten my license at 16, my parents would have kept the teenage car around, and I technically wouldn't even be stealing anything.
My is Minecraft
Wait? How do u eat without a mouth??
I would've put on the note  "Rachel said it was okay". That way, it totally wasn't your fault, if you did get in trouble
Happy Halloween Month Rebecca the Best Month🦇
4:20 even without the reference being a factor, you can still picture the wicked smile XD Proof mouths are useless
Wait what the hell happened to the pumpkins?
6:27 SAME
Is it bad that I to as a child tried hiding in a see through shower during a game of hide n seek?
Why would you hide their!?! Lol
Do you know that really old video you made when you said you went to London soon or probably might go to London with my dad so I might see you there
My hole life is dinosaur faze
They say theres only five love languages but theres a sixth one between me and my dad. War. Nerf and war. Shooting each other every day with our best guns and aiming right for the head and trust me it is the best
LET'S GO SHE IS BACCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
Recently I was mad at my mom and decided to run away. I decided that if she TRULY loved me she would stop me. Boy was I wrong! I ran the plan by her, and this is the reaction "Good luck with that." I Decided maybe she knew something I didn't and left it at that.
Doctor: girl oddonesout doesn't exist Girl oddonesout:

Rebeca’s mom:She’s the mean one ms.Grinch
Me who is still in the space phase: am I a child?
nice!
I accidentally ran away from home once! I went outside to get an action figure I dropped from our apartment patio, I thought I asked for permission from Dad and then found out he didn't understand what I was saying! So when I came back in,he was super ticked off!
U can't talk with no mouth
Anybody Childhood that was in 2020-2022 can never EVER be a life story animator      Those in the future won't know if they don't know

I love this so mush can you tell a story that you got some one in trouble if you did this.
Me and my sister would "run away" to the back garden where we'd camp out on our trampoline and make ourselves a little house, it was a lot of fun!

At first I thought it was let me explains stupid but when I reread it, it was Let me explain studio🙃
My longest phase I went through was a weirdcore phase that is still staying with me to this day

Back in elementary school, a friend’s mom picked me up one day, and she had the idea for me to call my mom, sounding upset, to say that I was still at school. My mom only realized something was up when she heard my friend laughing in the background
ITS BEEN SO LONG!

6:15 I can't stop laughing..... 🤣🤣🤣 I would have screamed my head off
Me and my friend love your videos 🤩
Kewl
What editing app do you use?
Did someone noticed the "ara ara"?!?!? lmao  greetings from Mexico
Coming back to these animation channels after a few years this channel brings back so many good memories 😭😭😂
I started laughting outloud when your mother got to wash the dishes! Like, I figured she didnt buy it but the "she'll come back when she's hungry" logic works too
6:25 , I couldn’t help laughing
Hello :)
Soccer I've been waiting for years to your video to come out your videos are very cool but it's very very cool but it's only hours I mean what am I supposed to say oh yeah it show me years to see another video of you and actually this video is very nice
Lol
when are you going to explain studios?
I actually did Runaway
Um i.... this vid was a day after my birthday  edit:nobody cares-  *6 m o n t h s*
Omg I want to get that note book but I can't get it.
I’m in angel with a shotgun fighting till the war that I don’t care of heaven won’t take me back
i ran away to my backyard.
Did Becca's toonsona never have walk cycles? I've just noticed coming back to the latest videos, she moves by sliding around the stages rather than stepping. Was that always the case, or has the animation needed to be made more efficient lately?  In any case, it's still brilliant - you can't be anything less if you can make a character mimic the Grinch's evil smirk while not having a mouth!  (also, love Little Becca's pigtails turning into devil horns every time she comes up with a scheme)
I actually run away end came back 1 minute cuz it was raining
Lol
Kids on field trip today kids we will be looking at a kid yells look YouTuber Rebecca also Rebecca I think you should be doing Mike more ghost stories go flying around the Drone everywhere and try fine like abandoned things scary things it with your videos also I would love to see that it will make me really happy see you do that with your videos and thank you for you do

1:59 tyrannical? that's... common sense 🕴️in my country you can't let a child below 11 go by themselves from school to home becAUSE THERE ARE CREEPS, EVERYWHERE, and if they're going to go by themselves they always have to go with a friend or two
I'm having watermelon for the picnic
About 2 years ago when I was 9 my mom and all my siblings were going to play a prank on my dad you see my dad was the person that worked everyday since me and my 11 siblings yes 11 were home schooled, so anyways my mom and siblings were waiting for dad to tell her to get out of work so when mom got a text from him saying he's coming home we turned all the lights off  (just fyi my dad gets home around 6:00) and hid in my mom and dads room then we did the prank we face timed dad haha and then put the phone on the bed so he wouldn't see us and then    WE SCREAMED INTO THE PHONE AS LOUD AS POSSIBLE!!!!!!!!! then we ended the call right after we screamed when he got home he saw the lights were off and turned some of them on then found us in his room laughing and chuckling so we laughed it off and that was our story 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Could we just talk about the INSANE amount of wonderful (awful🤣) charm Becca has? She’s almost as  those gay messes from the owl house 🤣
Ur a red head 🤨😎

Hi Becca
I once ran away from home but the story was that my mother was in the hospital and my sister and I went to the hospital. but it turns out that my mother is in another hospital and I stupidly go to my house which is in 5 kilometers from the first house, luckily me and my sister were not kidnapped. That's my story, thanks for reading.

Idk why I loved that ending so much. I was supposed to be scared/worried because Becca ran away from something but everything was just so calm before and after Becca slips off the screen
She has no mouth and four Fingers

Yaaay!! I wait months for this!!! I love you
I neevr did the prank, buy i did that phase too XD
I live in the woods and I was born in the woods so dont even
Animation kinda lazy the characters move on the screen without proper walking or running animation and the mouth not even bothering to be animated it’s bad that it’s good in a special charm
It’s been a long time since I heard a story time animation video since like many months and have you heard about Rule34
Rebecca: eaten by squirrels Me: A squirrel
I remember when I was little running away all I did was grab a backpack and some clothes and I just put it in my moms car LOL!
I made a small timelapse of a fan art i made for you so please see it https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ

If I was you I would hide behind the freezer because my house behind the freezer was a tiny space and it was the perfect fit for my body.
Me (After using a "Cheap Move" to Win): (4:17)
I have a soldier phase look at my profile picture
Rebecca: I was weird not stupid Rebeccas teeth and lip scar: *exists*
Omg I live your family 😂😂😂
I do love your channel
6:17 KILLED ME!!!! HAHAHAHAHA
Man i missed your videos
Means i’m third grade too.
Same I run away because I get sad or mad my parents be like ok just don't come back crying me wait who is going to feed me I have no money wgat I got in my bag my iPhone XD
fun fact! when i was 6 my mom left me outside bc i was mad and i sat on the porch while she wasn't looking... i decided to go on a little... stroll? around the neighborhood and when i was done... uh she gave me a beating -filipino child
How did you eat that bread 🤨
The fact that I went through the same phase-  I actually ran away to my friends once and then just sat on her step because she wasn’t there and then just walked back and my parents didn’t even notice 😊🥱😳
iPad phase help me
My big brother as a little kid said to his/my mom: "i'll run away!" then my mom said: "Don't run away, lets run away together!  Then they went to picnic for a while and then they just returned home like normal. :D
"you probably will keep going through phases" me:HHHHHHHHHH HURRICANESSSS HHHUUUU
Now I have no idea who you are or how I got here, but I like it.
maybe I could help you carve those pumpkins..?
we were all or are weird kids
I'd like to propose when it's safe that you just host a giant picnic where oodles of my fellow Explainers come to eat sandwiches while you tell a story live
0:23 nope i was thinking about cheese
"...I gotta toon out!" There!! You're welcome, fellow OCD members lol
I have my own funny story about running away! I was about 4-5 and my older brother (6-7) and I were planning on going to see the jungle. We got up in the early morning and right when we were about to head out, my little sister (2-3) decided she wanted to go too and if we didn't let her she was going to tell our parents. So, we took her with us. I don't think we were out that long, maybe 20-30 minutes. We were like right outside our house in a ditch. Obviously, people saw us and called the police. A police car arrives and took us back home. I think the only reason my parents didn't get charged with anything is because we seemed so happy and we were telling the police officer all about our adventure that we were planning. Sorry Mom and Dad, love you!
Hey anyone here remember or seen hot wheels world race or acceleracers it was a great movie serious.
7:39 Ah yes.  Minecraft cave sound
Awwww I thought something would happen at the end :(
This happens every time I play hide and seek.
Who else stayed silent at the end where there were tree shuffleing in the background      I thought a animal wanted to eat the food…….
That ending was so unsatisfying why would you do that 😫
"Let's get your dad."  Had me rolling 😂😂😂
Your mom scares me. Lol.
Finally the queen that makes us all laugh is back yay yay ☆☆☆
6:16 When you forgot to take out the dishes from the sink and put them in the dishwasher
So none of us are going to mention what happened at the end
Legends has it that she never made it out of the woods
*Are you a Sight for Sore- eyes* I see u finally uploading.
Bossiness
it was at that moment 6:18 that Rebecca knew she screwed up big time
it was good
If this is real then how did you eat...
oh fxxk
and how the hell can you eat when you don't have a mouth? in animation
You’re the inspiration for my entire channel
[as]
running away is easy its the living is hard Rebecca
In my family we didn’t call it phases we called it seasons. Every time when 3 people who’d be interested in something it would become a season. Just wanted to say a little thing our family did.
My little brother tried to run away once and he came back one minute later
i love to play pranks but i never can XD once my dad went somewhere with my sister and i told my mom "psst! when my dad is back act like im missing!" and i hid behind the couch (my favorite hiding spot) and when my dad walked through the door he said "wheres * my real name *?" and my mom said "i thought she went with you and erica?" then my dad thinking it was real said "you have got to be * bleeeeeeeeep * ing kidding me." but then he heard me giggling behind the couch and the joke was ruined-
Honestly my love language to my father is just calling him ugly since very little i mean he calls me ugly back to so its far 🙄
My birthday was on the19th :)
Aren't we explainees?
Plot twist:Her mouth is on her stomach this entire time and that’s how she ate the food           👂👁👅👁👂 Edit:I thought this was funny but now I think it’s weird-
4:20 oh that's form Grinchen. Love it!!
the thumbnail art is adorable
That is an absolutely cruel prank. You pulled it off well... for the most part. But it was well pulled off. Probably for the best that your dad found you before things got out of control. Also what were you going to make with 200+ pumpkins?!
6:22 Rebeca ya está muertaaaa,no más no vio a su papá veniiiir
What app do you use to draw your animations 😶
The grinch smile without a mouth is so good omg. I love how smooth it was
Blessing
It’s almost spooktober 😆
I love how nobody’s talking about oh my God she posted!!!
I went through a dinosaur phase and would think I was a Utah raptor because Utah is my favorite state and I like raptor as well
when you were sreaming I LAUGH SOOO MUCHH LOLLLLLL
omg
Amazing story & humor aside, I love the fact that no one is talking about the ominous whatever-it-is that's stalking Rebecca in the woods.
That’s my idea
I do that to except I don't write a letter or anything I just go on my bike and leave for literal hours and don't stop they've learned not to trust me my moms planning on getting me a tracker for my bike
YOU ARE THE BEST
Speaking about the call with the pumpkins Becca what are you planning are you planning a little mini movie with some other Youtubers being the girlfriend fairy or the witch of the woods in scaring them during trick-or-treating 😏
OMG YOU ARE BACK!!!!!!!!
Also a seven love language chocolate
I love how she keeps eating the food at the picnic
I want through a horse rider🐎 phase 😅
Also I am happy you got your tree house
I just wanted to say you and James are my favorite yt ever and you inspired me to do yt and draw and paint I even know what your Intro by heart love your vids and pls never stop doing YouTube
My phase is My Little Pony and hiding away like I was invisible plus running away lmao
the fact that people at my school told me they'd try to run away when they were younger. like, bro, I never did anything like that in my life, because if I did, my mom would've beat my ass lmao.
4:10 🤣🤣🤣
If a big studio says why did u go to utube instead do u say let me explain studio
Can you do more videos like this I love the part when your dad found you in the shower his reaction was so funny
I never stoped my villain phase
Awwe, thanks Rebecca for releasing a video why you’re running from the IRS🙆🏾‍♂️
Omg I thought this was one of her older vids🤧
That intro was amazing!
Bth I missed her so much she was gone forever :(

hi becca question here!if your a musical kid what musicals do you like?
i honestly thought this was by jaiden animations-
Is it ok for my phase to have been both space and Dinosaurs
That ending gave me chills
i miss massie bring her back pls
Finally you back ^_^ 😢
Once I ran away my found me tho
How can you eat
Your voice is so pretty Becca 😍
So what kind of software and resources do you use for your animation? Also, who's going to be the next fellow animator in your videos.
hay Becca next time you do questions in a video, could you answer my question...
Why is no one talking about the ending!?
My dinosaur and pony phase is _EVERLASTING_
I love how the food starts to slowly disappears (gets eaten) while the story progresses
I'm still in my space phase (I'm 12) i doubt I'll get out of it
"when I was a kid, when I was a little boy, I wanted to be a tyrannosaurus Rex more then anything in the world I made my arms short and I roamed the backyard and I chased the neighborhood cats and I roared everybody knew me and was afraid of me and then one day my dad said 'BOBBY. Your 17  it's time to throw childish things aside' and I said ok pop, he didnt really say that he said 'Stop being a fvcking dinosaur and get a job'"
2:34 same
This has nothing to do with the video butttttt        What happened to Nacie from her old videos
Rebecca: Everybody goes through phases as a child.  Me: INVADER ZIM SUPPORTERS, ARISE!
And I’m a kid👱🏼‍♀️
moms could be the best 4:09
Gooney you’ve been not ending a video all week and week and I’m already nine already ate already and you’ve been a long time I did not try to find a new video you again but you will never be entered in the video again I feel you I do not like when you don’t end up with you at that time make more videos really quickly
I actually ran away at 13 I was gone for 2 days and the police were looking for me and my bf I left bc I didn't want to get him into more trouble if the cops never would have been on his ass I would have stayed away and my dad actually stayed up for those 2 days waiting for me to come knocking at the front door he cried non stop he didn't even eat either for those 2 days my lil bro kept going into my room asking were I was while crying all of my friends were looking for me including the school but I'm 14 now and I can't lie sometimes I want to run away again but it would get my bf in trouble and it would hurt people but if nun of that would happen I would do it again sadly
you gaineed a sub !
"426 Pumpkins."  _ESCUSE ME WHAT-_
I wanted to do that when my mom punished me for being a bad child
Im always in a video game fase
ooop
I like how that writings better than mine and u wrote that when u were 9
What happen why you took long
Aw! A 6th love language. How lovely!
I'm a second born like Rebecca. I'm so glad!
*What an AWESOME MOM!*
4:17 *Oh, the horror in this part!*
*Yay! She got the privilege to walk to home from school!*
I never ran away from home.
I once got really mad at my parents when i was a toddler and i tried to tie a blanket to a stick. But i couldn't find out the knot for it so i just carried the blanket like a bag of gifts over my shoulder. I couldn't even make it 20 meters away from the house and i ended up sitting in front of the house. My parents thought "aww, it's a little picnic!"
Dinosaur!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
play minecraft, and if you do play with technoblade
Dont you like live in a tree house you remodeled
I’m 8 years old!
Yes
nice animaiton skills :)
My was frozen then one day I just grew out of it and hated it
All of the 1.k that disliked the video are saying "Dis I like"
I gotta say this I have actually thought of running away and actually got ready to do It ;-; (P.S I DID NOT RUN AWAY DO NOT DO THAT KIDS THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS!!)
SHES BACK
I think that to I’m 8
Hi
4:16 😈You’re a mean one, Mrs. Parham…
My parents would probably do the same ;-;
No because I would have been murdered by my father if I pulled something like that
428 pumpkins.... What the duck
Will the notebook be available after halloween?
"i will give my address when i find it"  truly iconic
She is so beautiful  😊
😭
So are we not gonna talk about how she is eating a sandwich at a picnic with no mouth
I remember when I was 7 I tried running away, I’m happy that I couldn’t figure out what to do and ran home crying to mummy. I still regret a lot of stuff I did as a kid.
more like hook, lie, and sink him
at the end, my heart was beating fast because i thought there would be a jumpscare xD
LOL THAT STORY IS AMAZING!! Your mom is a mad genius!!!
You look good in real life
😍💐🌹👸🏻💜💜💖💘
You wanna know a crazy coincidence? My mom's name is Rachel. (which is your sister name) And my mom's sister's name is Becca! Which is your name!

I've been a follower of Rebecca for a while now but how did I miss that her character changed hair colors?!?! LIKE WHAT- I thought I was better than that..
Wow you really explained that bag on a stick XD
i had a fnaf faze😔
You remind me of my at teacher
Ah yes... The devil child Rebecca... The best types of story's!
Why does Becca’s mom and dad character designs look like Mortys parents from Rick and morty
cring
dang, im learning about the great depression in school rn and the fact that she refrenced that
I had a space phase now I been in a anime phase
You and jaiden animations are more iconic than Jessie and james
The setting of this video has me wowed tho. I think want… a conspiracy!!!  Also, I wonder if those pumpkins will show up in an October video…
I think that is her 5th piece of merchandise on the same 10 seconds of 1 of her videos
I ran away and then when I came home, I got spanked by my dad. Lol funny story tho.
e
did i get this video recommended to me after i got recommended a video on how to completely disappear? maybe
I like how she brought a whole cake to a picnic! XD
??? Everything was so wholesome, but the ending tho??? Um, is there some lore I'm missing out on??
0:53 i had all of them at the same time.
The ending makes me wonder if she's building up some kind of story or lore in her animations while she's in the woods. That would be kinda cool. Like she hears a rustle right at the end of the video and runs off. What was rustling? Or who? Just something interesting I thought of
remebering the time I brought a tv remote when i tried to run away once.I'm not kidding you ksahj
The ending???? Ms. Parham????
ok lets be real were all wondering HOW ON EARTH DID ONLY 1 SLICE OF CAKE DISSAPEAR IN THE ENTIRE VIDEO!!!!!!!!!
running away is easy its the leaving thats hard
My running away from home phase was a coping mechanisms for my depression and the horrible school experience that caused it, I never ran away but it was a comforting thought, that if it got really bad, I could run. Related, I have no idea how a healthy relationship, school experience or childhood is and I always blames myself when a situation goes south.
Another important component for the woods is:      A Toyota Land Cruiser!
._.                ITS SO FUNNY                HAHAHAH                      LOL          HAHA
The note at the end had me hysterical. "Ill give you my address when i find it" and the "bye❗" with the heart 😭😭
1:22 why is their among us in the back ground
NOT first
Finally I was scared that you didnt post
I didn't enjoy the story time
I've been in a "space fase" for like 3 years
Child: exists Squirrels: haha kid go aaahh
What happened at the end there?
how did the lemonade stay in the blanket not spill???? .........WHITCHCRAFT
Does this mean I’m gonna become an adult artist
I will never have a dad like that if you got me back 100 times I’m moving out
Wow
"I had no intention of running away........ BUT MOM AND DAD DIDN'T KNOW THAT!"
Im still in my watching-random-animating-channels phase.
Rebeca is my only faze
Ello
Yay new video
I Had A “Five Nights At Freddy’s” Faze Who’s With Me🌚✨
AHHH OMG URS SO PRETTY
⊙•⊙
No I’m thinking we’re have you been! Lol I missed you.
niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
A Grinch reference, that's it. This video has it all.
wtf how do your videos keep getting better?
I went through the David Bowie phase... I lied I still am.
Squirrels are so evil
Lol who Close a door like that:D
My video froze at 3:39 and I didn’t realize so I thought it was just leaving the face on that expression for added comedic effect lmao
Me who had a dinosaur phase, pony phase, and space phase simultaneously.
Can we just talk about here eyeshadow? I wuv it
Yay new upload!!!
Hello, Rebecca Parham! Your geeks and peeps, Explainers and Entertainers, and your little oodle lallies here.
4:11 The best moment in this entire video
JESUS WILL COME SPREAD THE WORD PLEASE ❤️✨
I almost tried to run away once. I put some toys in a suitcase and went out the back door, remembering that my mom didn't like me using the front door. But the movies I saw showed people having good memories when they were about to leave, so I did that and decided not to leave.
I went thru a similar phase as a kid and instead of going with it my older sister told me I would be kidnapped and die (I was "running away" to the graveyard a block away) I just walked like half a block away and then I saw a stranger and hid in my backyard Now I am afraid of strange vehicles
where have you been
That was a nice ending :)
2019: There will be no Crisis this year! 2020: 0:29
Um so no ones taking about the end lol -
Rebeca is cute
2 minutes later* HEY MOM WUTS FOR DINNER
I’m a duck
ITS BEEN SO MANY WEEEEEEEEEEEKS AND MONTHH
*She needs to be a vtuber, also I haven't seen her in a long time*
Bruh her 3rd grade handwriting is better than my current handwriting lol ;-;
i got in a pokemon phases
0:53 an emo phase, oh wait im still in that *unpauses my chemical romance*
I had a communist phase
Ok so we do a little bit of trolling            A small bit of Tom foolery             A margin of humorous jesting
Did anyone notice how though out  the video she was slowly eating the sandwich then the fruit and then the cake
What happened to the ending there she didn’t even say original Outro? 🤔
I like how the food starts to get eaten more and more every time it cuts back to adult Rebecca, it's the little details that make it. :)
My family also loves to mess with each other
I was late coming home one time so my father called the police as i was walking to the door hung up then beat me for being late.
WOMAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD
One time y ran away
There was no tuning out. GUYS, SHE'S STILL TUNED IN!
I never thought I'd see a grinch smile, but without a smile.
i always thought you had no mouth
I remember when I tried to run away when I was 8. Thought if nobody could find me I wouldn’t have to start school again. I didn’t even get out of the house my brother stopped me before I could even open the front door
No I'm wird
sheeeeeeesh i ACTUALLY ran away from home, can confirm it is not fun in the slightest
I half expected a jump scare at the end since it's close to October...
Why is it always the Dads getting builded 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was half expecting the end joke to be her getting trampled by an avalanche of pumpkins.
4:46  funny toxic shit right here bruv 😂
she might be the grinch...
Omg, when the mom made the grinch face, I laughed so dang hard!
I had a running away fase😭🤚
I remember when I was four I got mad at my mom and I packed up everything I had into my Disney Princess rolling suitcase. And by everything I mean all of my underwear and stuffed animals. I didn’t even leave the yard :/
Your back yeah
This was hilarious. I was laughing my butt off. I'm glad you wouldn't trade anything for the parents and family you have. I'm really surprised your mom even joined in. Also you were stupid and weird. I made the mistake of using my mom's card as well. Like last year. And I was in my last month of being 18
I was Fixated On Guns And WW2 And Nazis
She is back
someday i will put down the stray
So what you're saying is you were a weird kid but you were raised right with loving parents....interesting *sips tea*
I cant stop laghing 😂😂😂😂
So are we not gonna talk about the ending or...
she’s missing one thing something to build a treehouse with
I played the same prank on my dad
You did an annoying orange cameo, but like recently
What Da HELL
I Think I was the dinosaur kid and I was both weird and funny
2:02 literally every parent ever (before covid that is) "you need to get off your computer and do something construct, how about you go outside?"
Anyone else getting Odd1sOut vibes with this animation??
just wanted to say that ur little singing type of thing in the beginning was beautiful :D
Dum dum
your voice is so good that I want you  to make a marshmallow alone remix with just your voice(triple dog dare you).

7:04 Huh. Our handwriting is kinda similar. Cool.
A NOTE BOOK I HOPE I CAN GET IT😁 NICE VIDEO
I left a note to my mother on her bed saying i was running away to live under the church. Not the basement but my baby brain said yeah theres a hole that goes under the church i can live in. And then. I forgot i left the note so my mom comes home like wtf where did you go
When her mom found the note, I was waiting for the shocked and scared face, and then I remembered, “Oh. This is Becca’s Mom™️.”
Yeah, there is no way in hell Rebecca is neurotypical.
0:30 It's at scenes like this that I'm reminded how similar we are, lol.
Yay
Hi rebecca i love your videos ive watched all of them and im subcribed
I would watch this, but my dinkster daily came on
I love the stories inside of stories in these animations :)
Don’t worry Rebecca me too me too… 😂 the running way phase was a weird one
0:46 Mine right now is Transformers. I used to collect Bionicles figures in the past until the toyline stopped. I just like robots, that's why
My family has 7 love languages. Messing with each other and some super bloody pranks.
Dinosaur phase for me
This was the best video
What has happend to your voice
YAY YOURE ALIVE!!! :D
Why did middle school me have worse writing than 3rd grade Becca?
Almost everykid has tried to run away as a kid before lolololol
:D
Actually what I was thinking was Becca Why are you gliding from behind the bushes without taking an actual step LOL
Rebecca love your videos and trust me as a kid I did a lot of wired things as a kid too and my family loves to mess with each other too
I did the same at my grandma's house every time but to the back back back yard
I only reason I never had a "run away phase" was because I couldn't tie blankets at the end of a stick. Still can't figure it out
Lol I actually ran away. I was weird AND stupid.
I remember having a whole phase where I wanted to become a bioengineer. I have also always had an obsession with dragons. So I decided I would grow up and engineer dragons into a real species.
-_-
Lol
OMLG epic
I REMEMBER THE TIME MY FRIEND ESCAPED SCHOOL- 😭
Awww you have not posted in so long✨
You sound and look like an English teacher lmao
I need a girlfriend, soooooooo... Do you wanna hang out? (use ur magic)
I love how her mom didn't get mad but instead she joined what a nice mom😀
My phase is that i get phases
We're all weird in our own way
Our families have the same love language, and I quite enjoy it as well
Wait how did she eat the food... she hasn't got a mouth...🤣
A video! The time as come
*I went through a pony phase* 👁👄👁
Talking about phases I was in a burger phase.........
Can you make a video how do you think of the original Spiderman movie
I realize every child when they get the whoopiana or just a whooping the trying to run away but they almost forget that they still love their parents
My dad bet me $5 to run away. Five year old me went “bet” and did it. I didn’t get far before my mom drove to me home. Got my $5 though.
Everyone is talking about Grinch smile. I am wondering how Rebeca eat and drink without mouth.
5:04 like mother , like Sister

Me and my brother had a blast watching this on his birthday <3 thanks!
Is it bad that I like, actually wanted to run away from home? It really wasn't that bad but I still thought I would be better off alone in the woods somewhere.
this has to be one of my favourite stories yet
Mouthless people if there mouthless then how can they talk?
H           u        h                ?

Amazing! Wonderful!
Your handwriting 25 years ago looks like my handwriting now wtf
Fnaf phases :)))))))))))))))
Yesir she uploaded
As a teen I thought about it but I knew I didn't have the funds or any way to safely get out of the desert and to town.
This video really made me understood the no-mouth thing, the look on your mom's faces from the "awful" idea. Great video.
How did Rebecca take a bite out of that grill cheese without a mouth? 😂 😂
Rebecca: *dinosaur phase, pony phase, space face*   Me, who had all 3: *i am powerful*
I was JUST FUCKING THINKING ABOUT FUCKING CREATING A FUCKING CHANNEL CALLED FUCKING "LET ME EXPLAIN"... BUT THEN! I found this and im rlly happy
Becca, those backgrounds are beautiful! But don’t stress about them so much if you don’t want to. We don’t need the backgrounds if you don’t want to make em!
Me too am a Weird kid ….eh……my parents trust me so they let me explore places cuz well i like exploring
just take a moment to realize, *becca is so small se ould be eaten by squirrels...*
Who came here for read comments!? like here 👇👇
Relax, that bush rustling at the end was just me. I'm hungry.  pls send food...
That grinch was an amazing animation that’s so what I was hoping for
Yeah that’s because kids SHOUDLNT be walking around outside by themselves…
did you ever get those pumpkins?
I wish she uploaded more
How long did it take to draw the background??
Becca there’s two cups and 3.59 million of us. Poor planning
I am on a dinosaur face do you know what tea Rex can eat 300 pounds meet a day like a triceratops or Stegosaurus
I actually ever run away 2 times but I got caught……
There’s lore here… I can feel it…
4:11 god this is the most funny bit lmao
my little oodalalies is the best thing of my lifetime
7:01 jeez I’m a highschool freshman and I even don’t have handwriting like that
When į was 10 į ran away from home, because of homework
I don’t think I ever got out of my “liking dinosaurs phase”, because I got offended when you said that it was just a phase.
4:11
0:50 i have a dark memorie phase and i dont wanna talk about it :)
Are we gon talk abt the end...
A what artist?
How’d she eat the food tho 🤔
*Rebecca.* never in my life have i ever felt so upset to not hear "but now i gotta tune out"
Maam😌 I can totally relate to that🤣
My phase is guns
Is there such thing as a gun phase
Where's the pumpkins
ANIME fase I’m still in it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHDMveJ02rg pov: you see a wolf and your in the woods
We all have a FNaF faze Rebecca
missed you! used to binge-watch you a lot. haha
Just how her eyes looked she wasn't buying it ok Mama where is that Grinch grin
I think the best prank I ever played on my father was when my mother and I put a stuffed skunk in the chicken coop. My dad yelled at it for about a solid five minutes while my mom and I were watching from the house laughing hysterically. Finally I went outside and grabbed it and waved it in his face to show him it was stuffed. He still hasn't lived it down.
Great to hear your soothing voice once again!  Keep safe and healthy ☺️
“I was a weird kid”. But the question is, do weird people know they’re weird? If you’re self aware that your weird, are you really ‘weird’? 🤔
My phases: glitter    slime      spinner         scared of injections (still is ×_×)
Everyone’s talking about the grinch reference but I’m over here wondering what that ending was
the first part…. UR SO PRETTY!1!1,!!1
I still am in a dinosaur faze
That was me to
Everyone runs away eventually, just when your in college debt and a failing relationship.
Pumpkin spice
I couldn’t walk home alone until high school
“We all went through phases as children”  Gen Z: Suicide phase, WW2 phase, ect.
I see a fellow Texan here
Eskusmi i need tuning outt
im in the mario phase. i have been for 13 years.
My parents never let me walk home. Not once. I lived next door to the Elementary school for 6 years and I couldn't walk home by myself. Guess I'm stuck at level 1
Her life is like something out of a movie why did she run away from home
I'm sick rn
Im going through my "i need to look good " phase
Anyone else think her singing is beautiful except me?
Rate
I'm glad rebbeca didn't get eaten by squirrels!
The whole note :  Dear mom and dad, I ran away from home to find my own life. i will build my own house and find my own food. i will find a job and get some money. Dont worry about me and put up some signs that say you have seen me. i will come and visit you, you can come and visit me too. i will give you my  address when i find it.  Love rebecca,    P.S  I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. and i will miss you.  Bye!
I've been stuck in the art phase for a long time now.
Let me tell you I was screaming when your dad found you 🤣🤣🤣🤣  That animation was perfect!!!
What happened at the end?
When you first sat on the blanket was that supposed to be a seductive pose XD
Iiiii missssssedded you 😩💅🏻
Your finding back
Grinch Smile With no Mouth Lol 😂
AYO SHE ENJOYED EVERY MIN?  😳
Lol 😆
That ending was so unnerving for no reason
Anyone else notice that in every shot with her at the picnic once she starts the story, more of the grilled cheese is eaten. Idk how I noticed this so fast.
I had a dragon faze. Download a bunch of dragon games on my dad's phone. Eventually I just quietly slipped out of it. I still like dragons, but not to the point I was
So nice to see you’re still doing this YouTube thing, hope you’re doing well. You have such a nice storytelling voice, and your videos bring a special brightness to this platform. Thanks for the laughs!
I'm love these you need to post more I have watch every one two times
me two!!!
I remember when I was a kid I always thought about running away too. The one time I was very upset with my parents and started walking down the road, thankfully I tuned back after a while. I was mad nobody noticed I had left lmao. It was a small neighborhood but this was still in South Africa so it's not the safest.
I just found your channel and I must say I will be bingewatching ALL your videos today 😂🤣
Once again making an absolute banger video
Girl finally you post i’ve been watching the same video over and over again thank you just thank you
Let’s go new video let’s go no video let’s goooooo
What will happen if I post my address
WHAT 😂!!!
Me who forgot about this chanel and then discovered my love for it again.
…how long did it take you to draw that background 😟
Hey
Heu
AAAAAAAaaaaaaaaAaaAAAAAAaaaahhhhhHhhHHHhhh!!!!!! Soooooo cutte!!!
Am I one of the few kids who didn’t try to run away?
I actually did those things years ago
Uhh no I’m thinking why this shit is all staged I right too, how can how these things happen it must be really rare huh, it’s all the same person is all this actually happening there must be people telling you these story’s then you telling them.
I used to tell my mom I was running away and I'd mean it she never took it seriously and would ask me if I wanted dinner first, I'd say yes, eat and then forget that I was gonna run away.
What I wonder is  Why did she not feel weird seeing a random camera in the woods?
Ah yes a grinch reference 4:12
Hi Becca! It’s been awhile since I watched your videos because I got a new phone and still haven’t subscribed idk why though ⚫️🔻⚫️  I appreciate ur videos     ✨Becca is my inspiration to keep drawing✨
You sound just like my theater arts teacher
I am in a sonic the hedgehog faze right now
That ending is enough to make a grown man cry....and that's ok
i had a lego fase
how did she eat the toast
#UltimateDuck
Aren’t you excited for Halloween 🎃👻!!!! Its right around the corner!!
#Whatcunowaboutrollingdowninthedeep
Ah, yes, a beautiful animation. Something that my device can’t handle, taking it that I randomly got a crack on the screen WITHOUT ANY CONTACT TO *ANYTHING.*  6:16 IM DEAD, GONE-
Actually I was thinking about sonic.exe
i havent watched you since your last video witch was 3 months ago, and over that time i got a new art style. watching this i just realized how much your animations and art has affected my art style. i absolutely love your videos and have been watching you for a while.
5:14 Incorrect because nobody is cold in San Antonio
Anime phase
i had a fireman faze and I'm 10
Nobody will save you in military city
I'm a space and dino kid
How the french baguette did she eat the picnic?
Oodalaiis, love it
Me and my sister had a plan to run away (that obviously never happened). We would wait until I had a car and drive away, we would live in the car and go to the bathroom at a 24 hour CVS that was near us. I would get a part time job to pay for gas and stuff and that’s just how we would live.
I have a internet face
She is backkkkkkkkkkkkkk
4:21 I love that reference
the grinch face made me spit my tea on my ipad /srs i had to clean it
The end was so heartwarming :)
Are you trying to start a witch coven or something because I want to join if you are
For the prank when your mom read it she probably thought and she immediately knew that it was a prank and if you guys really did when you guys get hungry would come back
4:16 Hehe nice
man i really want the backpack but $50? come on man
Yeaaaaaa new vid
I actually have runaway for a couple of days
I was a latchkey kid as well but my parents wouldn't notice I was gone unless I missed dinner. We lived in the middle of NOWHERE with some cows and farmland and then a whole bunch of nothing followed by mountains and eventually a prison. It was like a 30-minute drive one way to get groceries. I was also the youngest and got up to zero shenanigans as my other brothers were too busy getting all the attention by being absolute lunatics (One did Meth the other was just a high-strung asshole).  I think the idea was that my two older brothers would look out for me but unless I was bleeding right in front of them they were happy I was nowhere to be found. Usually, I was out roaming the desert looking for arachnids, bugs, and weird animals. So many rattlesnakes out there too.
What were u doing when u were not uploading
I wishes you all the best, keep up a good work
Me : yea phases are the worst  also me who never left there dinosaur phase:
Worry about me, I have gone far away.... to _skull_

“ We must’ve all had little addictions and little habits as kids. “  Me : *becoming a furry as a kid and still am one*

Rebecca's baaaaacccckkkk!!
Question. Is it possible if you can do a tutorial for art :^ I’m trying to find a art style
You know youre in deep ****** if someone opens the shower accompanied by a high violin. At least he didn't have a knife.
"Running away is easy-Its the leaving that's hard"
Help
When I was a child I was just asked with blood knives and people getting hurts
My family is honestly the same with messing with each other. However, I don’t have a run away from home story. The closest thing I got to running away from home was trying to walk home from school when I was in, like, kindergarten or the first grade while my mom’s back was turned.
Becca: Believe it or not I was a weird kid Me: I’m still weird and I am much weirder still
God bless you and Jesus loves you! Have an amazing day :)
my brother and I had this phase, there was this one time i put girl scout cookies in a bag and was planning on going outside to run away, but i got distracted and came back to find my cookies melted inside the bag. :(
Did you watch eddsworld you have tom bear in one of your videos
at the end the guy come's with the 426 pumpkins
At 6:18, I laughed so hard 😂🤣😆
My phase as a kid was fnaf. I LOVED IT,
My favorite nongendered opening ever.
f
When I was little, I REALLY wanted to run away for some reason. I think I thought it would be entertaining and funny to see my parents’ reactions. But I never did because I thought that if you ran away, there was a rule or something that said you could only bring a bendel. I knew I’d need more than a water bottle and a sandwich or two, so I just did it in my mind.
i had bayblade phase
I love the channel and I would never ever try this but this when her mom turned into the Grinch I just 😂😂😂😂😂😂
You know when I was a kid I had a strange fascination with vintage clocks and the strange aesthetic of them. I tried for so long to figure out what the mysterious feeling/vibe i got from holding & looking at them was and turns out its called "SteampunkCore." A really cool aesthetic that matched up just about perfectly with the feeling I was experiencing. It's pretty cool.
Cool
Grinch mom🤣
0:51 I had a car phase as like a 5 y/o now my phase is minecraft ;-;
Yay the queen is back!!
I LOVE THE DRAMA U PUT IN HERE KEEP IT UP:D
Pov: You thought the video was the daycare video and didn't realize that it's a new video Me: *Thats life*
I tried to run away from home when I was five.  My brother stopped me with one sentence. " What key do you use to get out?"
When I was 2  I walked across the street to the park
I like ran away from school😎😎😎😎😎
OMG You FINALLY Made A Video
One time, me and my mom pranked my elder brother by telling him she lost me at a park. I was hiding at the foot of the front seat and he shot out the door with no shirt on
Nice handwriting
A weirdo always a weirdo
Look ik this story is outstanding and all but I rlly want that cake….
But it stopped after 2 days U-U
I had a kill-my-mom phase bc she. hates me
I died of laughter as soon as she started to join in
Hopefully a baby that can read and write isn’t seeing the vid
eaten by squirrels XD
When the dad saw her I died laughing
your the best!!!!!
Me who is a youtuber and have to do 30-60 jumping jacks on a b or a day
What s in the bush? Sorry for bad writing I have gloves on.
4:16 oh goodness I hated that. that scarred me for life lol
This is my favorite video so far
I actually ran away as a kid down like one block
Pranking and messing with each other is my family's way of doing it as well XD
Loveing it
She’s back
You know I’m still in the dinosaur face and now I’m planing on going to college to become a paleontologist.
HOLY COW you look so pretty in the intro!
Rebecca please for the love of god don't put lore into these I might actually lose it
had the same thing when I was 11...im 13😄😐
human pheisis
The fact that she kind of drew Apple Jack from mlp
1:41/1:45 If someone know about The Owl House, please tell me I'm not the only one that hear Eda voice here and now think that they are kinda similiar in behavior and voice. I never thought of this before until now because well, The Owl House didn't existed before and when it existed I "stopped" watching her videos or any video in general because I was too busy watching The Owl House, Rapunzel and Amphibia or some Random movies and Series on Disney or Netflix, but now exactly this day I opened this video and now that I heard Eda voice I can't stop from thinking that it's similiar.
Lol
good singing in the beggining
My favorite phase was my Eddsworld phase
Beautiful forest drawing, my god
Omg… the grinch motive. Even without the smile was very effective
I just wanna say your voice would sound amazing singing An Unhealthy Obsession okay have a nice day
DAMNIT I FORGOT YOU’RE THIS BEAUTIFUL SNDKBADKBAKDJWKSK IM FREAKIN OUT BRO
Me be like wait you don't have a mouth

7:28                                                                                                                                                  MASOCHISM INTENSIFIES-
You know kids so well. Please tell that to every single parent out there
So I’m not the only one that some what loved the idea of running away from home I packed my bag once and considered leaving
WHATS WRONG WITH CANADA!?
Lmaoooo the ending
i used to pretend i was a wild creature when i was little. i put on my panda onepiece🐼 , i "built a nest" in a cardboard box📦, filled up the bathtub with cold water to use as a watering hole , built some kind of canyon out of furniture and then i took some crackers and oat milk and made some kind of soup, i ate the soup and... proceeded to play (i can't remember what i did after that except keep playing animal
-_-
My teacher put this learning song on and i realized the the way it was animation and when the credits rolled out I saw this channel
I’m 9 and have always been in a map, geography and history phase
The animation and the way this entire video is played out is actually really good, nice job
The animation and the way this entire video is played out is actually really good, nice job
space phase? i'm still in that phase... xd
THE QUEEN HAS POSTED
Everybody’s talking about the grinch smile animation but nobody is talking about the fact that Rebecca didn’t say the last sentence of her outro
I wanted to be a cool kid and be going alone or trying in the mall to try to be lost lol
1:31
Does anyone know the song playing when her dad found her? 🙏🙏
I like how im the best kurokos basketball character.
Bek
No surprise your mum joined in, your chaotic attitude had to come from SOMEWHERE 🤣
I ran away a few times as a kid, too!  When I was eight I decided to spend the night at my best friend's moms apartment, but didn't ask permission first or tell anyone where I was. Around 10pm I realized "oh heckity I'm gonna be in so much trouble! I should just stay here forever so I don't have to deal with it!" Then I arrived home at exactly 1am to apologize to my very tired mom for trying to run away. But before that my friend and I had been sent alone to the grocery store to pick out dinner for us and two adults, only to return with a can of oysters, a can of baby corn, and some Arizona teas.  Then as a teenager I tried running away cause I was late home again, and my mom tracked my iPhone to the local burger King before dragging me home. Didn't even get to finish my nuggies ;-;
No, I was wondering if. No wait, that’s illegal?
Can we talk about the noise in the bushes for a sec?
That ending was mmmm I’m gonna make theory’s!!
0:56,  I see you, Applejack.
IS NOBODY GONNA TALK ABOUT THE OUTRO
Omg this story is so relatable 😭🤧😖
i wonder if i will think of this stuff in the third grade well i am because im in third grade and im watching this sooooooo.....yeah

Nice.
OMG SHE FINALLY POSTS SOMETHING IN LIKE 2 YEARS
AMAZING UPLOAD SHEDJUUL
for as young as you were your handwriting is phenominal
4:20 Grinch vibes right here
Cant relate i was just smart (no offense ur kool to)
I like to imagine Becca, in that very last panel of the video, just had heelies on, and with her witchy powers made them work on the woodland grass; turn up the volume and potentially hear the ever so faintest "whirr" of tiny wheels turning.
so basically as a kid you were Earwig from Earwig and the Witch
Messing with eachother is also a love language for me
How did you eat if you have no mouth
Foreshadowy
Same i also was a weird kid.
BECCA WHERE WERE YOU I MISSED YOUUUU
:0
I am still in a phase where i love canada...    Im irish 😅
If she has another Channel plz plz tell me what it is
No ones gonna mention rhe weird outro?
omg I love your videos keep up the good work!ヾ(@^▽^@)ノ
my fase was guns
niña
5:18 this is when you flush the toilet and wait for him to realize.
wth?
I thought youtubers spend 90% of their weekend energy in one full video
Llll
Oh no you actually did it
That's right. never miss the opportunity to make Dad look like a jerk.
Rebecca. last seen in woods. ????-2021
I'm in a space phase
SHESSS BACKKKKK
Let's be honest, we all tried to runaway, even cuz of a big brother 💀
When ever she posts and does the intro it makes me happy.
0:28 didn't get a word except depression lmao
Jeez its been like 2 months since i watch your vid And i almost forgot your channel
As someone who grew up in a house with more girls than boys, I can confirm that pranks are always amazing.
Finely
#1 Mom of the year!!!
Você já pensou em colocar legenda em português
My goodness that mouthless grinch smile was wonderfully animated! It exuded chaotic energy :D
SHES RETURNED!!! FUCK YEA!!!
I'm still on space faze

Love the attention to detail, you can see the food slowly disappearing
ohh i used to do the same
Picnic.................PICNIC!!!!!!!!!     !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I keep forgeting about this channels existance
Or a witch
You know after that crack I heard at the end of the video I was expecting an animal or a bear to come in and maybe mess with you
She finally posts!!
I always do this I always do the like putting myself in the bathroom
AAHHH HAVENT SEEN U IN AGE!
Why, grinch smile without mouth. Cool
thank thor im a wikin and i wanted a winkin book
did anyone realize that the sandwiches at the end were gone?
You know, I did want to watch it until I saw the channel name. Do I have the right idea?
dam the animator iz bak
I like how running away from home is only a good idea when you don’t know how horrible the world actually is
I have a Halo phase
it would be awesome to redo this video with your family voices, or your parents opinion right now
How do you eat if you don’t have a mouth in the animation XD
Me when I was a kid: (a fam fight happens) I GOTTA GO *grabs scooter and empty bag*
I’m still in my Greek Mythology phase
I’m still in that pony faze… but now I have a pony! Sooo……
This picnic was the best
Lil Rebecca holding the Applejack Figure, so cute 🥰
HOWNDO YOU DRAW BACKGROUNDS SO GOOD
I absolutly wanted to run away, but the plan was to consume as many poisonous mushrooms and berries as I knew wich  could make me very sick and I was very sure that after 3 days they could kill me. I just wanted to stop beeing a nuissance to my parents. Turns out i was a good kid stuck with abusive parents
#50 On Trending???
Me who ran away at 13 and never came back: *“Concerned adults?”* **Visible confusion**
i have all feeling your teasing something security breach style
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I loved this story!
Well, now we see where Rebecca got those brilliant acting skills. Like mother like daughter.
Why did you not make videos for five months the odd ones out Also didn’t do videos for seven months are you animators things are busy or something
verry unsatisfying end :( im sure it was the pumpkin guy coming with all those pumpkins
Did anybody notice that she showed the food slowly getting eaten! That's attention to detail.
Mmm I missed your voice
Grinch with now mouth XD
Im just conserned on how your gonna eat that food😂
Hey becca do you make about your video your pet
theres lore now why has it have to be lore
AHHHH ANOTHER VIDDDD
I love how you "ate" the food during the video
Did she just sliding?
I love the references to classic works.
My sister just made a pillow fort she hides in everyday after this video came out, thanks Rebecca 👍

Have any of yall had a sea or Greek mythology phase?
Wait are we all gonna just ignore that she draws her parents just like Jerry and Beth from Rick and Morty
Raise your hand if you thought there was a jump scare at the end✋

6:19 soundin like a guitar and a rock band
True
Your backgrounds are amazing!!!
4:20 Of course this face is here.
ayo wait i had a thought. So the top of the skull isnt fully developed when youre born. which means you could die by a drop on the head when youre very young. Now, think about what the dad is doing during 7:23. If that wouldve happened when just born, things wouldve gone different. Think about that. *ahem* UNTIL NEXT TIME MY FRIENDS!
oh rebbaca run away sad😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
5:09 Look at that neck connection line and tell me that doesn't look like a frown!
Where the tune out
Man, young Becca has better handwriting then I do as a junior in high school

Spooky forest noises at the end. I smell Halloween shenanigans.
0:50 I am on and still am a train phase which has been going years. then I got sub-phase (land rover series sub-phase)
so are we just not going to talk about what was in the forest at the end?
Hi
The funniest part was probably when her mum made a grinch face
H-how did you eat a grilled cheese without a mouth
What’s so sad is that we have to wait one month for a new video from Rebecca
Rebecca: *runs off* me: hey, can i at least eat the choccy cek?
E
Lovely grinch smile great work
Your mom just see this video...
How, you, eat?  How, you, drink?
:)
I still feel really bad for rebecca bcs her dad died :(
I was actually thinking how are you talking without a mouth
Happy knowing with Halloween on it's way, comes Halloween themed videos. X )
“your mom is the grinch”
Once I was at my grandfather's house and I was in his room hiding behind the door where all his coats were and my whole family was looking for me  I got in trouble 😂
I was bracing myself towards the end of the video I thought there was going to be a jump scare.
I ‘ran away from home’ in my own room one time apparently. My mom was freaking out that I was missing for hours. But I was just in my room playing with my barbies. She asked me how long I’d been in my room and I said “A while” and the look on her face 🤣 can’t get in trouble if I’m just being quiet as a dust bunny in my own room 🤣
Is it just me or has your animation gotten smoother?
I went through a phase when I was little of trying stupid things out of sheer curiosity. One of the things I tried was running away. I borrowed a tent from my brother and took that and a pillow and blanket and went out the back door in the middle of the night. I intended to find a place to set up the tent and sleep there and come back in the morning. I ended up just outside a small plane airport about a quarter mile from my house and tried to pitch the tent. I failed because I couldn't see well in the dark and didn't bring a flashlight so I crawled into the flat tent and tried to go to sleep. After about ten minutes of feeling very uncomfortable I gave up and went home.
The irony is that she in the animation she live in the woods
I never grew out my horse phase- i ride horses now and own a few- 😂
HOW ARE YOU SO PRETTY?!
my weird obsession was car washes  seriously

I won’t be able to get the backpack but your dad is funyy
audio distortion is perfect
abotu phases: i had a cars phase(the pixar one), a sonic phase, a novice video game player phase where i mostly stayed in my own couple of generes, then i had a minecraft phase, then I had a general video game phase, and then i had the stereotypical anime phase, and now im playing a bunch of video game generes and anime. and now it's my teenage years.... im 13
Rebecca: now what would make you think that?   Me: the title
Epic late
I love how every time it goes back to the pick nick shoot, it changes every time XD love the little detail.
What’s with the creepy sound in the bushes and then running away?
4:17 here’s a time stamp for the Grinch reference everyone is talking about. You could also just watch the video through and find it, as was intended, but y’know, people have varying priorities I guess
What if the dad after the joke scared sayed im leaving and left for ever... So much just for milk
you're dad's scream reminds me of a big daddy from bioshock
I remember this one time my sister got super angry at my mom and I always listened to her so she decided we would run away, instead of taking necessities we stuffed all our toys into trash bags and started dragging it into the back yard to try and sneak out. We had like LOTS AND LOTS of toys and they were all stuffed animals so it was wayyyyy too heavy for us to lift it up and escape the house and we stayed and decided to just hide in our room because I started crying saying I wouldn’t leave home because I didn’t want to leave any of the toys if we were running away. *Long story short we didn’t leave the house because I was unwilling to leave our some of our toys behind*
not bizarre almost every body has this exact story
was having a shity day, saw this was uploaded and now my day is awesome
At the end I was bracing myself for a jumpscare
I remember one day when I was a kid I was upset and wanted to run away. packed a duffel bag with toys, clothes, and a picture and then—  I was like “wait it’s pizza night”. and that was the end of that idea.
HOG RIDER!!!!!!!
IS NO ONE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FORESHADOWING?!?! WHATS THE HALLOWEEN VIDEO GOING RO BE THIS YEAR?!?!
When I was a child I never got the experience to walk home by myself because my family lived in a forest that my father had built but one day I decided that one night when my sister and my parents were asleep I would write a letter that ran away just like you did and I actually went into my forest at MIDNIGHT now that I think of it my younger self was braver than I am now anyway my dad went to go to the toilet which is next to my room and I usually snore and my dad didn’t hear snoring so he walked in the room I was gone. At first he thought I was in the kitchen getting a drink of water after he went to the toilet he searched the house and he knows every nook and cranny in our house and couldn’t find me at all and after that he was panicking and told my mother that he’s going outside with the torch light to search for me it was about a hour in the cold for him to find me lol I got in big trouble that day 😂😂
Where'd she go tho?
😀
Huh weird that’s what happened to me
One time when I was a child I got really upset with my mom and I ran out into the backyard of where we lived (it was a rural area with lots of forest) and detached my zippable coat hood and placed it onto a bush and hid to make her think I ran away into the forest. She found it and immediately started crying out of fear of me being lost in the woods, and I instantly regretted my decision and revealed myself and also started to cry. I never did anything like that again.
Rebecca needs to laminate that letter, it’d make a great prop for the story when she tells it to the kids of the family. Doesn’t matter if they’re her kids or or not, I GUARANTEE that, as soon as she pulls out the letter, her story will become, like, a bajilion times cooler to them!
Ahhh the grinch mother!!
"I knew I'd never get out without a concerned adult and returning me to a very angry set of parents," If I went out, things would get too nasty for me, very nasty. P.S. I'm a new subscriber I love your vids!
i think all familys have a different six one
A grinch smile without a mouth, true talent
This was one of your best yet!
Creepy thing: One of my friends ran away 2 weeks ago and is still missing-

Congrats on trending!
Your mom is hilarious
I had a animal fase as a kid.... Still getting over it 19 years later
Me? I had a rdr2 phase(still kinda in it...)
I really did attempt to run away at one point. I was being bullied by my own sister and her friends and my family wasn't doing anything about it (even laughing about it even though I was lonely and miserable). I packed my favourite rose-patterned pyjamas, toys, and a notebook and pencil into my floral backpack and then I walked out of the house. They didn't take my running away seriously but they did get concerned when I didn't come back after an hour and they went to go look for me. I was about to go cross the highway when my mom came to find me.

i thought the beginning was an ad and i tried to skip[ 👁👄👁
Wait so am I not going to be an astronomer because liking space is a phase?
The fact you could imitate the grinch smile with no mouth is pure talent 👏👏👏👏
You sound like a news reporter
No that isn't what I was wondering , I was wondering "how" did you move without moving a single muscle from your leg? Epic moonwalk but forward.
Nobody can unfold a blanket perfectly on the first try! You're a FRAUD. (maybe)
i ran away from home and uh I got my dads card and took some money and left for I think about 2 hours my parents couldn't find me but...i was in our backyard

My only hobby as a child was a YouTube
Aw! How heartwarming.  Ooo! Now do one about me. My mother was murdered in front of me when I was 8, by her second husband.  Don't forget your red pen.
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Us be like = *We're in a forest for no reason, knowing Rebecca will be here*
When I was living with my aunt, And I got mad at her, I would walk out of the door and start going down the road to the gate that leads out to the open road. I went so far one time that someone asked me if they wanted help finding my way back. I said no, Because I forgave my aunt and decided to head back to the house when I got to the open road. Never doing that again. And, Get this, We got mad at each other over HOMEWORK. So, ima just say, I was a dramatic child.
Should of put the troll face on your mom when she had that good awuful idea 😈
I went trough a space phase
“Pony phase” I’m 20 xD

Hello.
I sitll in my furry phase
Lets goooo
I ran away and my parents locked me out lol
You know still think about running away. I only feel like this when either my mom takes away my games and when I screw something up big time.
Lol
The farthest I got running away was the front yard jk
When I was a kid I always looked older then I was (I was taller) and I went through a very weird phase of drawing bloody things. I only went through that phase because of a friend I had (I'm sure she was a fake friend because she pushed me out a tree and into a bush in the third grade) and she was obsessed with creepy pasta stories and I had no idea why...
I don't know if this is something that happens everywhere, but here in Brazil almost every child has tried to run away from home when they fought with their parents, went as far as another street and then came back because they didn't come looking for you (they knew that you were going back)     sorry for the translation errors, anything blame google
My face word baby Yoda
I haven't watched your videos and so many days in years
I had a sticker phase XD
Wow best video in a long time Finally
I've never truly understood your mouthless drawing style, but I have a theory: you have trouble lipsyncing with characters that have mouths, so your mouthless style allows you to bypass that hurdle entirely.
If I were the dad I would have killed those 3. No I actually would.
Dcc
Im getting the notebook!
When I was in kindergarten I created a group that would agree to dig all the way to China in school during recess-
How are eating and drinking without a mouth!? Do you absorb it!? 😯
No one: Me watching this without a dad:😔
0:20Jeez, You don't have to go so deep.
That’s hilarious
I’ve had thoughts about running away I’ve never sat down and planned it out but I’ve thought about how easy it would be just sneak out at midnight fill a backpack with a flashlight rations sleeping bag a lighter walk to my dads cabin get my motorcycle take backroads out of state because I live somewhat close to the edge of my state I reckon I could get out in less than 3days
I missed this channel- I watched on a diff account lol. Ima sub again c:
At least if your dad tried to grounded you your mom can protect you

One of your greatest work yet
The only real phase I had Was a Sci-Fi Phase and it lasted For 6 years
i once  hid under the covers of my parents bed as flat as possible so i could scare my dad once he came out of the bathroom he was in there for a long time and i fell asleep so my parents prob thought i was  1 missing or 2 dead some where because they couldnt find me so they were terrified..... im the youngest so yea there went my electronics for a day
The fact that you did the grinch smile without the smile is so amazing to me. The smile is still there and yet we can't see it. Brilliant.
#50 on trending! Congrats!!!!!!
Sorry I’m late to watching the video!
"I was weird, not stupid." *Remembers Rebecca stealing her Mom's credit card, slapping her little brother in the face with a 4x4, making her faceplant into the ground by swinging on a lawn couch, climbing on top of the roof of a house, and a bunch more* Me: "Are you _sure_ about that?"

hi
I have noticed that the food was gradually disappearing.
🤣 once I hid in a blue bin that I can fit in but I left my hair out of the bin and I had the lid on top of me then everyone started to look for me and then after a bit I came out and they saw me and was relieved bc they thought I ran away and it was not purpose which was the funny part 🤣
My dad is a jerk
WHO'S READY FOR THE SPOOKY MONTH!?!?
Your mom made a memory you guys won't be able to forget and you will cherish it for the rest of your life
Love this animation and this is so funny. I remember the time I ran away and then I went back lol

I saw stupid and actually tried running away but I only made it halfway down the street before I turn back because I didn’t want to leave my stuff behind but I loved playing run a way too
loved the video but im trying to figure out if there was some secret stuff to find at the the very end EDIT: So at 7:38 you can see a shadowy figure at the top left corner of the bushes I'll see if I can find anything else
My names natasoris Rex IM a t Rex
Yes i have so many phase subjects

One time, when summer just started after 4th grade, I actually ran away from he into the woods, and I think it lasted an hour before I went back home and by the time I came back my mom was talking to the cops on the phone and I got into a whole heap of trouble.
I'm YouTuber lol bruhhhhh
Bro the Grinch face without the mouth 😂
6:18 the opera commenses
Holy shit YouTube commented on this. Congrats gurl
Wait is anyone wondering how she ate food with NO MOUTH?!
lets take a time to respect her a,azing handwriting at that age
OMG this videos was so fast I'm a big fan
Love your work ❤❤❤❤
Around third grade I actually almost ran away because my dog had just died and I was dumb 🙄
One time I tried “playing dead” in my parents’ room so I wrote “[MY NAME] DIED” on a post-it note and stuck it on my parents’ bedroom door, then lay in their bed with my hands folded over my chest and my eyes closed, waiting for one of them to come in and react.  It backfired because my dumb ass ACTUALLY wrote “DID” instead of “DIED” so my mom came in and was like “You ‘did?’ You did what?” And I had to be like “MOM, I’M DEAD.”
I love these videos and its always so fun when I see that a new video has been published, keep up these great stories!
*adult telepathy*, beautiful.
🌎🔜🔥B.C. (Before Christ) and A.D. (Year of the Lord) are timemarks everyone uses. There is no peace without repentance and resurrection. ⏳⚰️🪦✝️God made the food that you eat and the language that you speak and the air that you breathe. No love, no hope is greater than is Christ the son of God💚 Accept Him today freely as your savior who rose again and will rise you up! Only blood can cover sin!🩸 Everything was perfect before man and angel sinned
Congrats on trending Rebecca!
YO this is on trending
Every time I watch one of your new videos I remember how much I missed them ❤️
I love this girl
I did that when I was a kid too when my parents made me mad 😂
Omg the part where she was hiding in the shower got me lol 😂😂😂
Becca is a cottage core god
is it weird that I did the same thing as Beca?
“As a kid I was kind of weird” ahahahaha mere mortal I used to build torture machines for the good guy legos (it was the girly kind lol but not the baby one)
COME, MISS REBECCA! WE'LL FOLLOW THAT TRAIL!
FINNALYY A VIDEO
The grinch reference 
after Rebeca leaves  ???: Dang it man you scared her off ???2: well sorry Murry but I wanted to play with the stick.
I was not expecting the story to go in the direction that it did. Also, I like how you referenced the Grinch without the mouth.
noice
best prank ever!
It’s actually really impressive drawing someone with a grinch expression without using mouths.
I think messing with each other is my family's love language, too. I've been involved in so many pranks against other family members over the years I've lost count. 🤣😂
Nice merch
A delightful and fun story. Love the grinch reference and the skull eyes for the mother stare.
Bro YouTube commented on your vid
The way you drew the background is amazing. I love your videos ❤❤
I absolutely love that your mom got involved in the prank, it was great.
*rUnNinG aWaY In tHiS mInEcRaFt dAy s0 bUtIfUL 🥲*
i really wanted a witch of the woods backpack but i am not that rich sorry
the back back is 50 DOLLARS HALF OF 100 FOR A BACKPACK
Yay!!
Your so beautiful in real life!
Such a good funny vid
Grinch joke
“Why does she only post every 3-4 months?!?” *sees the animation quality* “Yeah, that makes sense” 🤣
God the space phase GOD I REMEMBER
Run run run
Who else loved the Grinch part?
I use to do the same thing with a hickey stick and a handkerchief r a pillow case
So much more light-hearted than I was expecting! I guess its because, I ran away for a good few hours as a kid. I was 10, and dealing with suicidal thoughts that follow me to this day. Of course, since I was younger, I didn't know how to handle it.
I love your animations!
When u screamed u sounded like nene from toilet bound Hanako kun when Hanako did her hair
at the end of the video i shouted GET THE GUN! my parents ran to me to make sure i was okay. hahahaha
I just noticed how much you look like my aunt Kristi
I love the fact that your mom was in on this one ^^
my longest going faze that is still going on is my lego faze
I love the subtle disappearing of the food bit by bit throughout the story.
That I have to say that I love this video?
Rebecca: parents have this weird thing where they think kids should not be walking alone Me: I get to walk at least five or more miles away from my house-
I didn’t know YouTube comment
i am currently in my space phase :)
So awesome*!!
she didnt finish the cake D:
HA running away in the woods😟🤤😞😞🥲😟😓😞😤😚😟😞😋😟🤪😮‍💨😓🤫😲😲😱🤥🥳
How is she talking with no mouth, I've watched plenty of her videos and I'm just thinking that. 🤔
I'm watching this on the toilet...
Who else stayed at the end card to see who made becca run away
6:18 good ol' daddy-o sounds like Sly Marbo not gonna lie
what do you mean when you say you were weird
Hi
U made me laugh 😆
5:18 Wallmart  logo
Can we all just appreciate how good she make animated moments in her videos like when the mom came up with the idea pure perfection 👌👌👌👌
https://youtu.be/78eTufSycnk  360' video 🤩🤩🤩🤩
YAY NEW VIDEO!!
Ok 2 things she never ate the rest of the cake, she had a hot and cold drink and she is probably gona be dressed in the best witch outfit with potions on a belt. Plus kill kill kill!!!
It's such a weird thing how kids often consider just running away from home because something bad happens or just randomly. I mean, I even considered it once or twice.
She's back! Or maybe she wasn't even gone, but I don't care! I'm happy she posted a new video!
The fact is I was in all of those phases I still am because I’m still a kid that includes the pony one
Oh my Lordy lord is that a Starbucks cake pop?!
I loved how you defined the Grinch smile without the mouth also it's so funny when you find old things and nicknacks from the past 😋✨

The fact that she was able to do the famous grinch smile scene without a smile and just eyebrows definitely shows how much of an talented artist Rebecca is
I Wanted The Geeks & Creeps Unisex T-Shirt.  It Sold Out Before I Was Even Following This Channel Though.  I Don't Know If Rebecca Reads The Comments As I Know She Gets A Lot, Though I Wish She Would Make More Of That One

Loving the skull-eyed death glare from your mum at 2:10. After what you’ve said in the past about what your mum is like when she’s on the warpath, that’s a nice touch. :)
I’m so glad to see your back !!!!

so when’s the 426 pumpkin unboxing video?
hey rebecca skirt or dress
I miss going to Bondi Beeeaaaach 🥺🥲 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIQW39_SyYc
That was actually the funniest, best story ever! It touched my heart on how much your family is loving. Also, your mom is the coolest and best parent ever! Her getting your dad pranked is too funny! Applause all around.
I remember this one time in my childhood were I must have been about 5 or 4 years  old. (aka the time of my life were I was most stupid)  I was mad for (I think) no reason what so ever, so I decided to grab my backpack and pack my favorite stuffed animal that barely fit. I walked up to my dad who was working at home at the computer and randomly yelled: "I'M MOVING OUT" and I thought my dad was gonna react super dramatic for some reason like: "NoOo OliVeR DoN't LeAvE".  Instead he was just like: "Wha- ok? Have fun i guess?". I walked like across the street and waited for about 5 seconds until I thought: ".......I don't think I will survive with a teddy bear and also I'm kinda hungry soooo" And then I walked back in again.  Have no idea why I even did this. One of the most stupidest things I've done
congratulations you got youtube to fucking comment on your video also i am currently in my team fortress 2 faze
Wait what if the amaazing collab with her will it be no face?
Grinch 4:18
Parhams mom: lets  get your dad.     Also her plays a prank on him

Yass she's back
Well, this explains a lot.
i was the one who took the slice of cake
Good grief the way she draws expressions without drawing mouths is impressive
i liked the background good job
Some of us had a dinasour Phase, a unicorn Phase or an space Phase but i got stuck with the youtube Phase since i was like 6 and i am still in that Phase
The outro just hit different
426 pumpkins? 6 too many...
Oh My GOD i LOVE This so MUCH

Recently had surgery, laughing still hurts, this was a horrible video to watch.
Me after just seeing one of you vids: INSPIRATION 5000
yes i tried to run to lol
I'm in my video game phase
To be honest I actually like this type of animation style, the videos are never the same and it's not some lazy animation like other story telling animations, you are one of the few people who I actually find entertaining to watch, please keep posting videos I'm not the only one that likes your videos, the voice acting is absolutely good,  Thank your for reading this  bye bye.
6:18  Becca's neighbours: what the-
I'm sick, but this is calming me down! :)
😃😃
SHE’S BACK
I never stopped going through my FNaF phase
lovely story by a lovely person ☺💗
Oh my gawd this sh!t is genetic😂
I lysm!
4:25 ... ... It’s official, I love your mother.
Come home‼️U lost? Bc without the One who actually gave you life, you probably wouldn’t feel like you have one because you’re living for the wrong things, you’re living for your freshly desires, not seeing that God made you for a greater purpose. Yes, the same God who became flesh that even though you’ve done evil against Him, He is the only way, and took our punishment so that we could live! But without Him we are nothing, because man was made for God, just as fish was made for sea and without it, the fish can’t live, so too with us without having God in our lives. Repent from your sins and turn to God because u could die any minute now and will have to face God’s judgement. Remember that you CAN be saved in Him, He loves you and He proved it on the cross.
ITS BEEN 3 MONTHS SINCE YOU POSTED\
3 months I mean
Its been 5 months O_O
SHES BACKKK!!!
Me at 5: I'm going to run away from home (but doesn't)  My mum: Runs away from home fot real.

Fortnite phase
Hi
I ran away from home, I was gone for 4 minutes, and got the greatest spanking of my life
You Forget the F*cking cake at the End ! The Sad Cake!
Don.t know how I came across this channel but six hours later and a block of chocolate I'm hooked hehe
6:13 WHY DID I LAUGH-
Ahh your doing the ol Stacy Barnett minor move😎 I see clever very clever
Undertale faze
Finally another video.
wait...... People ran away from home as a kid? i asked my mom and i have never done that
My family has that love language too but we do it for friends too lol.
Детерминизм это Свобода 🤙
6:22 Halloween special I hear???
hi
"Oldest child is supposed to know better" guess my mom is friends with Rebecca...
Perfection
Have you ever tried using a bat instead of a stick to knock em out
i love how your mom said "lets get your dad" truly one of the best moms
You'r a Good draw'er
2:12 the eyes have sculls love it
I hope your proud of his video.if not idk what makes you happy-
I had all those phases 🤣
You know that part about phases, yeah I don’t think I will ever grew out of phases. Still waiting for my emo phase tho.
To be onest i walked home in grade 1
Omg I was here since this video was 1 day yrs old
My phäse is pokemon
BREAKING NEWS, ADULT ARTIS— ah fuck you stole my joke
One time I was walking home from school using a sidewalk that faced the road that led into the neighborhood, and the mom of this kid I knew pulled up and questioned me.  I’m not exactly sure what I or she said _(looking back, I probably looked pretty sketchy walking along the road with a backpack)_ but she drove off, and I kept walking, and somehow later my mom questioned me about that same instance saying the other kid’s mom mentioned it to her.  So yes, adults _are_ all telepathically interconnected with eachother and there’s nothing that can convince me otherwise.
What does  1:43 2:00 2:15 4:02 5:28 6:29 Have in common                 They all have something eaten or drank.🍰💧
Funnily enough I was in the opposite situation as a teenager. My parents thought I ran out while in reality that was not my intention at all. But boy, were they angry when they found me.
i had both a dinosaur phase and a space phase lol i always hated ponies and princesses but I still like them both tho
Mine was very different i got home early i was for hours for my family to get back home i was like 8 they were so worried for me, atleast i had dogs to enteratin myself😂
The ending of that video is...strange
Since I have ADHD, I get something called "HYPER-FIXATION". Please help me, I've been messing with computers for 3 years now.
I once ran away when I was 9 bcoz my dad threw my ice cream away. I just walked around the neighborhood in mid noon and then my mom dragged me home and gave me another ice cream and then I was all happy again ;-;
I had a doom phase.
You never uploaded video almost 3 months
I think she wanted to explore, if my kid did this I probably would take them camping, let them get it out of their system.
The intro never gets old
Boredom is always reason how (⊙_◎) crazy plan  Happens
For me i went through all those phases at the same time
7:20 Oh you mean every sibling ever?
I had a titanic and the Britannic stuff like that and I still like just not as much as before and mean WAY less I know everything just from that year like did you know that something that could have have saved everyone on the titanic they were supposed to have 36 life boats but they only put 20    So they could see better and the people in the crows nest forgot the benoculers ( I butchered that spelling please correct me if you can)and just went “oh well” and they didn’t see the iceberg in time to warn the captain and when they were building the ship something went wrong and exploded and weakened the hull so if that didn’t the guy who caused that could have saved the ship because you need to fill 5 compartments to sink the boat
4:23 Me: Oh um oh- ok just aum. You know I’m actually gonna leave right now
Hey! Aren't you going to stick around for your pumpkin delivery?
You know I was also weird because I cry for no reason and when I drop my booger I cry and go to the ground to look for it.
You forgot a Kpop phase. One of the most important ones.
A wholesome touch to a deviously silly joke. Now this is a prank done right :>
I love the woods background
I laugh so hard 6:12
I feel like Toon Becca would try to escape her word if she tried to run away.
Okay the end was pretty sus-
Hahaha
Love your vids
*Heart this comment or i will run away from my home!*
I did the same game too
We like to troll  Its called we do a little trolling
I died and wheeeeeeeeeeezed
that was a sweet ending
2:50 so as you can see the sandwitch is bitten even though she doesnt have a mouth meaning that she has to alter the fabric of reality just to eat which is why she moved to the forest so no one could see her and why she only eats in-between scenes
Awe!!! Family teasing. My family also shows love by teasing
I love toon Beccas background story she's got going on
EPIC
The cake tho.:D
The👏🏼grinch👏🏼smile👏🏼is👏🏼everything👏🏼
6:05 your mom and dad had a good life with having frosted windows thats "very transparent and like a glass door", must have been entertaining, edit: (for them two, you just shouldn’t have been there maybe, looks like a masters bathroom get out of there crouching there lol)
Me: Watches a video The bots: allow us to introduce ourself
You are amazing at this job keep thriving
I had this phase too, mostly because I was seeking attention from my parents who were always taking care of my little twin sisters. So one day I packed a bunch of Legos or something like that in a blanket, tied it at the end of the stick, and told my mom I was leaving and never coming back. She didn't even look over her shoulder to say goodbye cause she knew I come back in less then a minute which I did. 😂
Wut
AAaAaaaAAaAAAAAAaAA
GOD LOVES YOU.  TRUST in The LORD.  You must be born again to go to Heaven.  BELIEVE the GOSPEL of JESUS the CHRIST the Son of God and God will forgive you of all of your sins that you have committed and God will give you everlasting LIFE as a free gift because GOD loves you. https://youtu.be/eZtZKkT50e0
dammit im a day late!! noo!!
Hehe fifi slippers
Sorry I’m swearing but fuck I tried running away and almost died
I also went through a phase like this (forgive me if my grammar isn’t great)  Once my mom was at some car place trying to get something fixed within the car She was paying attention to her phone and the workers who were helping us out For some reason i thought this would be the perfect time to run away.  So what i did was tell my brother who was next to me that i was running away and don’t tell mom This concerned him a lot but he went through with it (also to be clear he’s much older now and if i did try to run away he’d stop me quickly) So next after telling him, i had got up sneakily and went over to a house,hid behind the fence and a bush, i waited i think 3 or more minutes, then my thoughts had went to “omg what am i doing! I don’t really want to run away,what if they leave me now?!” So me being scared of losing my family i had came back in the car, my mom didn’t know what happened but me and my brother did. I’m just lucky i actually went back to my family and didn’t make a whole issue happen.
Hahaha Ummm is she talking about meee orrr
I went through a owning multiple tarantulas phase, tarantulas live like 20 years so they are all still doin great. do not regret. My parents were, and still are very cool.
hmmmm maybe?
4:16 That's my mom's face when she told me to walk with my twin brother to 3 different places for his job interviews. I think we walked for like 8 hours, I don't know. But damn, that was very evil cuz our legs were dead after that. (Not literally but you know what I mean)
I dont care any phases
Wow I was the same kid back then except it actually happened for 2 days and then I came back home and then you proceed to raid the fridge cuz I was starving but at least it was somewhere at the time so I wasn’t down in the rain by spring or being frozen like a popsicle in winter 👍
oh yes! my little pony and applejack she my favourite
didnt we all did this once-
You should make the witch of the wood Bag Red yellow and blue
ok i have been watching you for years what dose oodalolies mean
Finally another beautiful video from Rebecca
*Hey, to you reading* .... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Good comment I know but my sister would do this if she was like now she would do this now so do you like he’ll come back once like you gets hungry but back then if we ran away am I sister found out she would go ballistic she would literally be like gonna be killed by my parents my god what the hell she would really be praying for her life and I’ll probably be in the bathroom laughing fun fact actually one time my brother did run away to his best friends house that lives in the same neighbourhood as ours next door it’s not as if my sister could just go over there and ask if my brother was there since we haven’t done this once we’ve done this plenty of times he got in big trouble and you didn’t get to go to the mall with us us
Sorry Rachel if my brother wrote this sorry about this a like you just like was just like yeah I’m gonna run away I left us know just tell mum yeah I’m gonna run away I want to be the favourite child care I wouldn’t really do that I will just be like once he leaves once mum comes back I’ll be like your mama seater we got an emotional cleanup on I’ll nine also Abdeen ran away
Little Rebecca Pam I tell you don’t do the thing I did when I was four I walked outside for the first time and I tried running away and I ended up getting in way more trouble than I actually was because I tried to running away to my best friends house what is wrong with me I think I was over sevenor four because I tried to running away to his house and it didn’t end well
Phase... Um yeah my kid phase was THE WALKING DEAD
The animation community is at an all time low rn,I felt bad for them
I would get a tick and a bindle and try to go find a train to get on. But I never did and would always come home really upset.
I am currently in my adventure time phase and I dont think I will ever be out of it...     BUBBLINE IS CANON
You telling this animation is not taken from the odd1sout ?
I freaking miss youuuu-
ha, I wish my sibling ran away as a joke

How does the grinch smile look more terrifying without a mouth
My older sister kept "Exploring" the neighborhood, and there were always those "Concerned Parents" but they were not very kind, ever. sometimes they'd leave notes on our door telling us some really detailed and vulgar thoughts about us. But here's the thing: My sister kept Sneaking out, like when someone was in the shower, or at work. They kept doing it. So much so that my Dad had to lock all the doors and windows, top and bottom, locks every door, every single place to sneak out of, but she kept doing it, like grabbing chairs and furniture to unlock something and sneak out. Idk why, but every time, there'd be my sister at the front door, with one or more very angry adults who were ready to shout everyone's ears off until someone got the message, my sister never did (until she turned 8 years old)
I went outside for like seven minutes, and said I was leaving home because we didn't have mac and cheese funniest lecture of my life.
Hiya Beccy!
there was one time when my sister little we thought  she ran away from home and my mom was freaking out trying to look for her. Turns out she just went to our neighbor's house across the street
That reminds me i was riding my bike back and forth when i was 5-6 and when i hit the stopped sign, i was thinking “should i just run away?” then went back thinking of the food i ate
(me near the end) wow what a wholesome episode about family- aaaaaaaand I'm not seeping tonight
The grinch smile is beautiful.       Rebecca, can i clip it?
Oh yeah phases! Like how i had a sonic.EXE phase!…..you know maybe thats why i cant look at sonic the same anymore
I had a Star Wars faze lol
loved this video! actually had me laughing out loud!
trust me I dip my fries and nuggies from mcdonalds in my slushie or milkshake so I’m more weird then you
I never thought of running away. Idk why, guess my mom and dad were pretty nice to me. JK I love them :)
Her animations got cooler and this top 10 trending on YouTube congrats
is no one going to talk about the creepy ending?
Let me explain studio is my idol
3:52 .... for some reason it sounds like Venti- 😃 (her sister)
I love childhood rebbeca
Where's the fnaf phase
You still upload?! 😳 I never get notifications from your channel
As someone that lives with a dad that LOVEs to mess with us (and same goes for my mom), I can safely say the "messing with eachother" love language is ABSOLUTELY true!  Also I KNEW Rebeccah hide in the bathroom when she was gonna get caught.
amazing. just amazing.
Yas ur on trending
I Love the tiny details in the picnic! Every time she showed that scene, a small amount of the food or drink was eaten! ALSO THAT GRINCH SMILE!!! Also the thing apparently following her in the woods.
Can we talk about how every time we saw the picnic the food was eaten and I love that ❤️❤️
It has been a long time Rebecca too long we need more content.  You SHALL OBEY THEE thank you !!  We suffer from content withdrawals also your petty rad.❤️
how does one eat a grilled cheese or drink lemonade when you have no mouth 2:15
What is coming..
7:22 thats my dad to it hurtsss..
K totally real with you, the one thing that got my historically laughing was the dad blaming the mom like that... That got me good.... Man can't believe all of that in general happened... Awesome video.
I’m just jealous of your skill All animators have amazing skill
6:17  BRUH I CAN'T
https://youtube.com/shorts/vmSIF3W5vX8?feature=share
Having watched the Season 2 finale of Amphibia on Saturday and Sunday (live Tweeting my reactions made it take several hours and go past midnight), I thought of it as soon as I saw this video in my notifications.
the lore is getting high. after being found out as a witch in the woods by the town's people they chased her out of her fun house from the tour episode and it seems she's hiding it as a pic nic. I'm not so easily tricked rebecca!
Becca's mom: Modern problems require modern solutions
Ok what is she going to do with all those pumpkins?
More stories I hear about your mom the more she becomes my hero.
a fun and harmless joke as a kid. too bad I wanted to run away from home as a kid for completely different reasons
The grinch smile gave me nightmares when I was little. I would stay up all night staring at the plant in the corner thinking it was the grinch lol
When I saw the title I said whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Yee
Dad hello Rebecca  Rebecca no way home
How old were you when wrote that boy cause my hand write sucks
Good news! I moving to a new house first of spoopy month!
one time my sister and i apparently went...somewhere...as young kids. i dont remember any of it and im not going to ask anyone about it but the police ended up getting involved.
**pog**
I ran away from home once and i got lost for 3 days finally my parents found me
Every time I see your dad in your animation videos it makes me feel like he is alive in real life and with you
Amoooo esa referencia a El Grinch!!!💖❤
Anyone think of Pingu when they saw the thumbnail
Noice
https://youtu.be/obdI7tgKLtA
She sounds like a school teacher who would tell stories
im late
6:14 right before the kill.
YESS NEW VIDEO
oh crud, the squirrels found her.
ominous ending  I sense Halloween~
I feel like every child has the idea to run away at some point. Few ever go through with it.
I honestly love hearing her talk about her dad because you can tell how much they loved each other. It's hard to lose somebody but just going back and thinking about them and sweet, silly stories you have, it's so amazing to just hear and think about her father and her and how close they were I'm happy she has these fun stories to tell❤
I sat there waiting for you to say now I have to tune out
in just one day you got a million views congrats miss rebbeca :)
I live in the busy streets of Chicago and I go into my houses yard all the time I go around the block with my friends al the time lol
I LOVE THIS ART HAHA
so why 426 pumpkin? why such a specific number?
Whenever I got mad at my parents when I was a little kid, I told them that I was running away and I would walk out the door. I never made far. I would almost immediately get scared, then walk back in.
The Parham Women are chaotic
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooo oooooooo Ooooooooooooooooo
It as so good
Hold on Rebecca related to Caleb?
The queen has posted
You are one of the one YouTubers that inspired me
I am soon going to make animations once I get a graphic tablet.
Stories like these keep me forgetting that your father’s dead… he may not have been mine, but I miss him
The grinch smile with no mouth was perfect
😿Hmm I wish I had ran away! I hate my parents and siblings and I know they hate me too! All that is in this hell hole is hated, pain, mental abuse  and selfharm. Some days I are ok; but otherwise all hell breaks loose.
No one's gonna talk about the end??? What was in the bush? What happened? Why'd Rebecca run away?????
I thought you DIED
But then Mom got an awful idea *starts stealing Christmas
Wow ya umm ok?
ik why he do this animation Bc Prob her mom found the note and got idea to make this video
I dont feel like running away cause i have anxiety, social anxiety, and over thinking But in my dreams i always escape the house hehe
Me too I am wired
Man that is better hand werting then I could ever have
I love how at the end we can see the food has been eaten. 😃
I see your face……. Heehheheheheheheheheheheheheheheheehheheheehhehehehehe
it’s a good day when Rebecca uploads
Noice
I've been in my minecraft phase for 9 years please help me
Lmaooo I had this phase too 😂😭
I’m new 👉🏼👈🏼
I love that she just left her stuff at the end
Is anyone else concerned about the lack of the ending catchphrase? What's in the woods? Is she OK? Why'd she run? I need answers people!!
Mom's Demonic voice: let's get your dad  Me: SHIT!
I love you so much rebecca and I love your stories! I can listen to then all day long!
Play fnf if you want to it's the cool videogame ever it's so cool now if you want to go download it if you want to
Huh. My 7-year-old plan to run away from home was smart enough to realize I'd need food, and also smart enough to realize I'd still need a microwave, and so it involved sneaking out at night to the woods... but sneaking back in whenever I wanted to microwave a bag of popcorn. Cue the act of stealing popcorn at 3am only to run to the back door and realize that the outside didn't have a bed. ...So I'd have to sneak back in to sleep...
6:16 Me, when I walk in on my husband 😨
I love that 4:20
Yeah I had a military phase!... Its been 10 years, someone please send help, it hasn't stopped!
YAY
Rebecca: "we all had a faze, some had a dinosaur faze" Me: I'm almost 22 and I still have the dinosaur faze 🥺
new n…ne……NEW
Random question could you show us animations from your school time in ringling it sounds interesting
I used to pretend weekly I was a different animal….. Now I’m trying to animate furries, so I guess your right
Please tell me you are going to make those dog slippers a real thing because I that is the best idea ever 😍
when did she chnage her name to let me explain studios i thought one of those actually happened channels was stealing her thumbnails
That Grinch animation at 4:17 was honestly the perfect showcase of why you don't need mouths in your art. I mean, that was amazing! You can still show so much expression in a character even if you're missing a simple facial feature :))
Not the cliffhanger!!! Based on the pumpkin call, I call a halloween special!
6:18-6:24 was my favorite part🤣 and the Grinch reference was spot on even without a mouth!
Ii
How can you explain this?
I had a Star Wars phase
Why is becka/beka/ so CUTE IN REAL LIFE 👁👅👁🤘🤘🤘
my older brother had a LONG "running away" phase when he was a kid, that started nearly as soon as he was old enough to walk, (I know this from a famous family story where he actually did try to run away as a toddler, and got all the way up the street dragging his baby blanket, before our parents noticed) and lasted until he was in like. middle school. Now that he's old enough to actually move out, we can't get rid of him 🙄
Lol your stories are amazing! Keep up the good work :D also btw 6:18 my mom getting mad because I forgot to clean my room
The anime girl when they get scared: 6:17
Through the bush # backyardgins
Wow your video is 10th trending in my country
Who else had a mincraft fase
She did just like Rebecca when she’s going to be evil
Actually we were thinking where have you been.
ok the grinch animation is cool and all but its fucking terrifying
Breaking news fat kid eats more
I like how the food slowly goes away piece by piece even though she doesn’t show it, just the little details make this great
Becca you should do an anime style opening vid too. I’d love to see your styling.
Hello I'm a big fann can I draw you in my stley
I got very mad at my mom one summer day and declared I was running away. I got to the end of the driveway and she asked me if I wanted a bag packed. I said, "yes" and she said, "Wait there and I'll pack you one." Then went inside to continue quilting while I waited for my packed bag.
3:05 how is the pencil moving
I am in a video game faze
The amogus phase
me and my friends once hid in their garage and wrote a note on the garage door saying we ran away to go to the zoo. our parents were very mad
Love the background
The Story 🥰 The Ending 😱 Creepy!
Idk why but when I heard the roar I looked at my closet cause i did,t know where it came from 😑
She deserves way more subscribers than 3 mill well 3 mill is a lot , but SHE NEED MORE! MIRE MORE MORE!!!!!
I had a running away faze myself well me and my cousin both so you can imagine the mischief we got up too, we made 'maps that took us to the ocean, dragon caves, the whole fantasy thing' we literally had a plan I would pack my stuff go get my cousin and we would run . XD my mom stopped me when I tried to sneak out of the house at like 7pm bc we were gonna do it at night so no grown up would stop us while they where getting ready for work or bed, she had to explain it to me that no I wasn't gonna leave the house this late I'm 6 no, and had to explain that our map was gonna get us lost as A it was inaccurate and B there was no such this as dragon caves.
Isn’t it kinda funny how Becca’s parents look like Beth and Jerry Smith from Rick and Morty
Congrats on trending❤️
Anyone realize she was eating the food throughout the video
I was a kid I used to run away like 10 times when I was little 🤗🤗
No big long comment. Just dropping by to say heller. HELLER REBECCA!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmkwaAb-dSA
I had a 12 year pony phase
You have to make a new video like a week because I guess it’s good
I thought this was jaiden
My sister and I liked to play this game called "Going to China" where we would pack up a bunch of stuff in our pillow cases and the walk around and around the house for about an hour. We never actually made it to China because my mom would call us for dinner, but we didn't care.
No way it’s a new vid it’s been so long 😣 <3   Loved the video Tho!  P.s. don’t ever stop uploading for another 3 months… please
Mwhahahaha
All I have to say to the entire video is, Lol.
Suprisingly heartwarming ending
lol- i was both a weird and stupid kid, i actually tried running away twice, the first time my mom or i think it was my step dad, had come around the other side to cut me off, and had sprayed me with a water hose getting me soaked, hahahah
*All Becca’s are QUEENS*  *If she breaths, she’s a RUN AWAY*
I love this channel
Hellokitty 🤣🤣
You are awesome!!!
Girl tell me why I used to do that too !!!😩 🤣  Shit but I go out of the neighborhood!!!  And an ass whoppin 😊
2:03 wow she really got spongebob squarepants: battle for bikini bottom'd
I just love the talent you have I wish I had that talent 🙂
YouTube literally commented on here

Yay another story animation from Rebecca I just love your channel so much
i just read the title and KNEW this was gonna be good.
You be like at the end of the video and now I’m gonna die lol
That is both evil and silly all at the same time. Well played
Hey Becca I just wanted to say thank you for your videos. It's been a moody week and also been kinda down in the dumps lately. But your videos help put a smile on my face. So thank you so much for making me laugh and feel better. Love your videos always.
The Grinch is gonna attack us all D: lol not really
Can’t believe this woman just lists all 3 of the phases I went through
Ok....how did she make the grinch face with out a nose and mouth EVEN MORE HORRIFYING?
Wait... Is it not normal to have a run-away-from-home phase? >.> I once woke up super early in the morning when I was like 6 or 7, and decided to run away right then and there. But I forgot to put pants on, and ended up going in a circle around my neighborhood (which was one big loop), and eventually some teenagers waiting for the bus caught me and brought me home. My mother was *not* happy with me.  I don't think I grew out of that phase yet cause I fantasized running away for yearsss after. Good video! The 6th love language is the best one XP
Why is this so wonderful!!!!!
Hah! I actually did run away but uh- only got a few blocks. Five-year-old me was unique. And not playing it safe-
aint child you a little gremlin devil
Let Me Explain: kids go through there phases  Me: I’m in a gun phase…
You forgot the FNAF phase that 90 percent of children experience.
Evil litle Rebecca part 2 electric boogalu
Loved the wholesome ending!
But.. what about the Food sis???!!!!
OMG ITS BEEN SO LONG WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!??!!?!?!?!!
And who would want to run away from that Me: everyone would
I WAS THINKING OF THIS CHANEL YESTERDAY! T-T I miss this chanel
E
GG on Trending Rebecca!
I'm late 😭
I had a raggedy Ann phase and I’m sure it freaked my neighbors out
I was so freaked out; I thought there would be a jumpscare at the end...
*SHE LIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVES!!!!!!!!!*
Yo, how is your 6 year old handwriting better than my current one
My Side of the Mountain?
“I was weird, not stupid” lol if that isn’t me...
XD 6:16
Can't run away from home because I'm in a gravitational lock with the earth..
Hi
More and more creative each time!
Weird as a kid? Aren’t we all weird now?
New merch so cute
Wait you’re alive?!
Going to keep offering up my son for marriage.   He's a 6'5" Ginger teddy bear.
2:50 this video is fake how did she bite out of that sandwich with no mouth    Seems sketchy
I love uuuuuu!!!!!!
The dad immediately assuming it was the mom's fault that she ran away made me laugh not gonna lie, especially that little break in the story where Becca goes over it. The delivery was just really good there, especially the little laugh.
When I was a kid I actually wanted the villains in the movies win
I feel like every kid went through this phase myself included
*The memories of her not getting on the bus to go to daycare are returning-*
so...did anyone else see the walmart logo at 5:18 lol  great vid btw, it was halarious
when the world needed her most, she returned.
Thanks so much I missed your Videos!
Its ok im even weird
Oh I remember when From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler made running away seem so easy and comfortable. That book prompted me to upgrade from a bendel to a guitar case for all my stuff.
I had a weeb phase- still am
I think that the grinch smile with no mouth is better, so much expression in the eyes
Me and my brother would always do that and my mom would just say "they'll come back when they get hungry"
You know a prank's gonna be good when a parent is in on it.
Now I see why your parents were business partners. Your mom can smell bull**** from a mile off. Your dad... not so much...
Is it me or did many people go through a "edgy/cringy preteen phase"
YESSSSSSSSSS NEW VIDEOO              please notice me I've been here for so long :[
the screaming tho
🦁🦁🐵🦁🦁
And they say Becca’s mum’s savagery grew 3 sizes that day 😂
I contemplated running away as a kid cause of cartoons too, but I quickly realised I Really love my mother's cooking, a warm bug-free house and my life as a (mostly) single child.  (it's not My fault bro decided to hop countries to live with my cousins at age 11 and I was spoil- loved and cared for like an only child)
XD love your mom soo much. Your dad loves you soo much.
Bruh it like September not to mention that you probably made this in like may. 4:10
I had a dinosaur, pony, and space phase. In that order         I’m scared
My being in Third grade:
Haven’t been here for a while happy the intro is the same still
Awww thought Rebecca was gonna prank us with pumpkins 😭
Lmao funny story my dad told me a couple days ago! When my dad was a kid he ran away from his house to a FREAKING MOUNTIAN
A father in missing child mode = logic and reason out the window
0:53 AMONG U- [GUNSHOTS]
I used to run away a lot when I was a kid
My vampire phase was Strong
nimu 🤓
Amazing video
Love ❤️ this story
Angry birds phase
Wow running away home is kinda scary for me why?, because the fact that you have to live alone.  Edit: What the hell is going on?, i don't run away home tho..
1:56 Unless you're from Japan.
FINALLY A NEW VID
I remember one time my dad was pissed at me for something that I don’t remember and he forced me out towards the road and told me “go on, start walking and leave” so I did (I was also like 4) so I started running towards the road and then he told me to stop and come back. That was a weird day
So what you’re saying is…ADHD is just a phase!!!
Hi, my name is Ana, I'm from Brazil and I just want to say that your videos are amazing and give me the strength to invest in my future, thanks for inspiring me,and sorry,my inglês is very bad
Anime phase

Pog
First
Lol I actually ran away and just went and hid at my near by park lmao
Hi
Interesting…
The grinch smile is too accurate :D
It would be so cool if the endings for the next few vids told a story
hi good vid!!!!!!
Thank you so much for tuning in but now -
THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Have you lied, stolen, used God’s name in vain, or lusted (which Jesus said was adultery, Mt. 5:28)? If so, God sees you as a liar, thief, blasphemer, and adulterer at heart. If you die in your sins, you will end up in a terrible place called Hell. But there's good news. Though we broke God's Law, Jesus paid the fine by dying on the cross: "God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (Jn. 3:16). Then Jesus rose from the dead and was seen by hundreds of eyewitnesses. He fulfilled all the prophecies of the promised Savior. Please, today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will forgive you and grant you the gift of eternal life (Eph. 2:8,9). Then, to show your gratitude, read the Bible daily and obey it, join a Christian church, and be baptized.
Pirate
Poor dads, we are always been trick.
Can I buy the note for 10,000 dollars in cash

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rNnBg9jDuk
The fact that she was able to do the famous grinch smile scene without a smile and just eyebrows definitely shows how much of an talented artist Rebecca is
Good vid https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rNnBg9jDuk
I’m really in love with how you draw the backgrounds in your vids. That forest is amazing,Beautiful and so well done. I love it. I wanna draw backgrounds like that for my videos and drawings.
Are the small spooky details in your treehouse videos leading up to something? Feels like something is coming 😮
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Amazing video loved it
HI
how long does it take you to make you videos?🌺
what do u mean a weird kid u still are
This is hilarious!!!
I'm still in a phase
Traumatized father

Hi Rebecca I love you why would you run away because it wonders me
You finally posted
Plot Twist - That sound in the bushes was her dad playing a prank on her to get his revenge, again
i think i went space and dinosaur phase when i was a kid
I have that 6ths family trait
Me and my friend would lock ourselves in a room and and discuss the fact our moms didn't love us, and how bad people should feel for us, then our moms caught us and I was all "ONLY SHE DID IT I TOLD HER TO STOP!! I KNOW YOU LOVE ME MOMMY!" #numberonefriend (we were like 4-5)
Question is YouTube a phase cause I’ve watched it sinse I was six
ITS ONLY BEEN 2 MINS WTH WHY DID I TOUGHT I WAS FAST
Soooooo... what was the pumpkins about? 👀
I loved space a loooooooooooot
XD
i remember the first time i ran away from home when i returned all i saw were my parents with there belts out-
When we were 5, my cousin had a belief she was part wolf and declared her place was outdoors, so one morning she told me she was running away to start her own wolf society, took her backpack, and left. Her dad was in his cruiser going down the 3rd neighborhood away from theirs and saw her walking down the sidewalk dangerously close to the woods. My girl got in deep trouble after that one 💀
Pony phase is best phase :)
So much creativity in this one! ✨☺️
So I have a fun running away story with my little sister. One Easter she decided she was going to run away after lunch to the back porch. She grabbed a backpack full of toys, a camping chair, an extension cord and her Easter basket before heading out to the back porch. She stayed out there till dinner when she was done running away on her iPod. According to her she was going to run away until food time and then run away again but she wanted to be in her bed.
I CAME AS SOON AS I HEARD!
the grinch smile was always cursed, but now without the mouth its just horrible
That grinch reference was sooooooooo smart and witty and funny! Keep doing what your doing!
Wow your alive?
That happened to me one time whenever I was mad or when I feel like it I will pretend I'm going to run away by using my blanket and a random stick and I used to and still have a pony space cuz I love ponies
.
you invited me to a picnic and ate both sandwichs?
came back to dissapear again 😔
Dino how did you know
Did you really use a grinch reference
Noo my internetttt
I love your videos so much they always make me smile and laugh
Rebecca: " I already paid for the order, it's not my problem how you get 426 pumpkins out here."  Me: ".....420 whatcha smokin' ?"

It would be ready. And I got mad when ANIMATORS WERE HERE! I AM NO BITCH. I AM ANIMATOR VIA DRAWING and I was drawing a big ship called. The "IGN Yamato" the ship of nightmares and technically we actually had a battleship named that called "the IJN Yamato" a flagship of the Imperial Japanese Navy or "IJN" for short. This is a super battleship unfortunately it sank on the 7th of April 1945. Into the bed of the Pacific Ocean. (we actually sank it (whispers of "sorry japan") and adding salt. Or should I say radiation on Japan's wounds we nuked it damn Island not once. But TWICE with both the little boy (on Hiroshima) and Fat Man (on Nagasaki) both in Japan

I'd totally be like your mom when I have kids...LETS PRANK YOUR DAD
When you run away as a kid things you realize:i have nowhere to go i have no food and no transportation    Im not gonna lie i was like  I’m gonna run away and never come back and  it was after a bad day i was like 4 or 5    What was hilarious to me is that out of all the hiding places tou chose a very easy to spot place
Yay new vid!!!
Why this bag was made in less the 6 seconds 0:24
FINNALY

Woohoo o o W
This was ✨AMAZING✨
Happy #5th on Trending!
Haha! Me and my grandma played the same prank on my parents when I was a kid🤣
sooooo goooood
im building a cardboard minigun
Hey Rebecca, I have a question about the  collage you went to. Ribgling collage of art and design, I have looked into it and I have wanted to got for animation also. I am a freshman in high school and I need some tips. Currently I am in an advanced art class and am in a animation club already but I want to ask. What do I need to do in these couple of years to at least have a chance to get accepted. Please come back to me if you can.
Yay she’s back
426 pumpkins? It's almost HALLOWEEN! 🎃
Here
I like The Grinch referance
❤️
I never got out of my dino phase. And i dont want to get out of it.

What every teenager does at least once
Cries in daddy issues
Hi I'm your biggest fan
That part where she says she loved her dad picking on her hit me pretty hard because she said he passed away a while ago. Keep strong Becca, your dad would be proud of his amazing daughter
My tee is in the Mail!
7:39 What is it Becca? HEY COME BACK HERE
*im just gonna chill here in the comments for a bit I’m tired*
Rebecca I missed you :<.     Please upload more often thank you  -the most weirdest YouTuber
WHY would you need SO many Pumpkins?!?!??
Yessssss shes back
Rn im going through an tmnt and anime phase
It makes me feel really soft inside hearing Rebecca talk about her dad. I hope I can do the same about my mom in the future.  Thank you for sharing a very fun story with us
One time I went through a guinea pig face
Can everybody stop for a second and think about how unsanitary that would be to be in the bathroom for that long
"lets get dad." *Proceeds to become the grinch*
making us sitting til the end waiting for something to pop up to get more viewing time... well played.
gorge
Love your content! Everybody stay safe 🍒🍓
My names Rebecca:O
Can we just talk about the animation in this one?! It looket so smooth, and with very dynamic poses. Great job Becca! *chefs kiss*
Am I the only one who keeps laughing at the scared becca animation 6:19? 😂😂😂😂😂
I tried to run away from my Dad's house to my Mom's once.  I knew the way like the back of my hand as we were constantly being shuffled back and forth, and it wasn't that far away.  I admit, I'm a Mama's Girl and my Dad and his girlfriend didn't really know how to handle me at times, what with me being autistic but misdiagnosed as ADD and all.  So one weekend I emptied out my backpack, packed some clothes in it, and tried to sneak out in the wee hours of the morning.  Sadly it didn't work, as my Dad's girlfriend caught me with my hand on the doorknob, and told me to go back to bed because it was way too early for me to be up.  And because I was an obedient little child, I obeyed without question.  Never tried to run away again.
I love news reporter Becca!👩‍🏫
Look I know us guys are  stupid as can be but you don't have to call us out like that😂😂
Gosh darn BENDLES!!!
Lol 🤣😆 omg
I Thought Of A Comment A Awful Comment A Wonderful Awful Comment SUS
We missed you! <3
Hello
when i was a kid i had a zelda faze i still like zelda
LETS GOOOO SHES BACKKKKK
If i did that i wouldnt have to worry about the wilderness killing me
Good thing they don't have mouth 4:17
The phases thing at the beginning? I went through those all the time. Mainly through shows/movies/cinematic universes, but books sometimes too. I always am OBSESSED with that thing, then start liking another thing. I still love the first thing, its just no longer my whole life. Currently in an MCU phase. Only cause my favorite show is currently in hiatus tho
So much creativity in this one! ✨☺️
I can't tell which is better, the grinch face or the screaming gag after her dad caught her
That apple jack toy is missing its hat
*I WANNA BE A GHOST STORY* happy near holloween
Soooooooo acting runs in the family
But I still love you videos though
sunglasses 5:07
I love your videos but why have you not make any video since now ? First of all I thought it you were dead but it looks like you're not that was good
How tf is she eating food.
I wanna know who was in the woods?
Nice Becca.
🌎🔜🔥B.C. (Before Christ) and A.D. (Year of the Lord) are timemarks everyone uses. There is no peace without repentance and resurrection. ⏳⚰️🪦✝️God made the food that you eat and the language that you speak and the air that you breathe. No love, no hope is greater than is Christ the son of God💚 Accept Him today freely as your savior who rose again and will rise you up! Only blood can cover sin!🩸 Everything was perfect before man and angel sinned!
Nice handwriting for a kid
At the end when the bushes started rustling the first thing I thought was, "The squirrels failed to eat her once and now they are gonna try again."
I went through dinosaue and space phases
Your mom is savage…
I dropped one of my favorite songs today called "Mastodon"🔥🙏  https://youtu.be/H4qcOx65hyc
Me who once ran a block away from my house crying cause i couldnt have ice cream and almost got lost: haha, yeah, i wasnt stupid eitheir..
Apple jack, yes!
I remember when I was young I had a phase were I was obsessed with transformers to the point were I said I wanted to be one in kindergarten it even said to in the year book at the time
I noticed at the beginning Becca was singing something from Betty Boop  i miss those days :)
Hey Rebbeca,  your Dad sound like Harry Potter, Plus he said castle of pahram like castle of hogwarts. This is funny
Leviticus 23:33-36 The Feast of Tabernacles Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days to the Lord. On the first day there shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work on it. For seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. It is a sacred[a] assembly, and you shall do no customary work on it. Enjoy the upcoming Feast of Tabernacles. Shalom.
I do wish you would post more often but I’m really happy the days you do post
me during this video:Y E S, also other from my pov (point of veiw) congrats on #5 on trending :) (love your video btw (by the way) )
Considering the large amount of people watching, how much would you pay for that note?
What happened at the end..?
My lil sister had a "runaway" phase too but what waa more impressive is that at 3yrs old she had more of a plan than I do now at 21 🤣. This lil tyrant was having an argument with my dad and eventually yelled that she wanted to live with our uncle instead. Dads response was "Well I'm not gonna drive you so you're outta luck kid". My sis then proceeded to stomp out the room only to come back with her piggy back, looked dad in the eyes and said, "how much is bus fare?". This toddler was going to use her savings to bus hop all the way to our uncle's to avoid punishment... Like? How? Who taught you these things and why are you so smart? I think that was the moment we knew my sis wasn't a dumb pushover. Btw she had enough money too and knew where the public bus stops were! She seriously could've done it and even if she ran out of money I doubt anyone would turn away a toddler on a bus ...I still think about this often...
So... Is anyone else wondering how she's eating all of that food without a mouth?
Your mom and your sister should be a pro actor
I laughed hard! Best idea ever! I hope that if I get kids they will do this with me >:D
hahahaha I use to always want to run away as a teenager and successfully did once, 10 years later and I never want to leave my parents house 🤦🏽‍♀️
oh god what pickle did she go in now
I didn't get the tune out! I DIDN'T GET THE TUNE OUUT!!!
And 900,00000,0 likes
i recently almost did this and then got scared
Let,s get this to 500,000 likes
I love the grinch animation how did you do it
I still love space, and im a literal dinosaur nerd.. at 13.
this was a amazing video as always
:)
Rebecca and Rachel: *pulls a prank on running away* Mother: *Don’t even leave me out of this one-*
Me too
I remember I caught my sibling trying to runaway, they had their blankey filled with stuffed animals tied to a stick
Mhm yes eaten by squirrels
Pro tip to build a house, have one piece of wood
everyones talking about the grinch smile but NO ONE is mentioning the becca lore. it went from house hauntings jokes to actual fear about monsters in her forest. gourmet lore if i do say so myself
I had a space fase
Number 5 on the trending page!!!
With all due respect, you did not finish your cake or lemonade, may I have it?
who is waiting for the " but now i gotta tuned out " part lik- where did that part gotta tune out too  😣😣😣😥
Haha
The grin has anomation was amazing
This probably isn’t the last we’ve heard from whatever the fuck that was in the woods with her, is it?
This was messed up but pretty funny at the same time!
She's back!
She’s back.
Did you ever get the pumpkins though?
The video is amazing as always! But...what was the rustling at the end?
hmmm. missing piece of cake at the end of the video. must be a clueeeeee
I’m impressed that you got the Grinch smile perfect when your characters don’t have mouths
6:55 I am glad your parents never lost. That letter just makes me incredibly sad. Truly happy your parents didnt have to suffer through the experience of losing their child, especially after reading such an innocent and letter which by the way is real tear jerker.
0:49 I actually went for all of those phases Rebecca mentioned Plus an edgy animation meme nightcore vocaloid phase
The oval israel spontaneously plug because donkey infrequently zip afore a parallel cut. acid, feeble feigned agenda
I’m so happy u posted this video yesterday on my birthday
I tried to run away when I was like 5 or 6 because my mom didn’t buy me a chocolate bar
Probably a good thing your dad found you when he did, dragging a joke like that out for too long can be dicey, to say the least
Do a whole video where the characters actually have mouths !!! :D
LOVE the grinch face 😂
Never mind I went back a few videos and I forgot when Rebecca found the treehouse there was a creepy note inside the house basically saying hey “Don’t live here this place is haunted”😳
I tried running away from my biological father since I was five years old many years into five years old and then many years later as a teenager and now I am far away from him and with my mother
Girl who are you running away from is this lore 😳 girl you’re scaring me
THE GOD HAS RETURNED
GOT HIM 🤣😂🤣😂🤣GOT HIM🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
The 6th love language... never heard of that one before...  -casually trips brother down the stairs as a joke-
The story was beautiful
Lol moms are the best at pranks they get mad when they are caught believing something like that they want to trick another family member
I’m soo glad I wasn’t the only one that did this 😂😂😂
Yay new vid now, let's wait another month!
"Good YOU didn't DIE"   Some wise man.
cool video, i think it would be nicer if i knew english
7:38 "But now..." Guess we'll never know what she gonna say
That grinch smile without a mouth was the highlight of my day 😂
I told my two older brothers i was running away and walked out of the house my mom ended up picking me up when I reached the end of our neighborhood
what's with the outro?
Omggg it’s this video omg I haven’t seen your video for sooo long I’m so happpyyy!
https://youtu.be/xO65OBKwxXk
"I know exactly what you're thinking" "Oh, alright where were-" "Why do i have this handkerchief bag?" "No... No i wanna know where you were mam' "
Awesome vid but you should have made the teapot and cup look like Mrs pot's and chip
Same and once I almost did it but my mixer kid gut said “hey how about no”
Loved the video.  The shower sequence was especially good.  The Master of Suspense approves.
my friend went somewhere alone, as a kid. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  she was fine afterwards
The quality of your videos has improved so much since I started watching you! (I wanna say around 2017?). Worth the wait for a new vid every time!!
Ever notice how she just becomes the watch  mojo woman randomly
REBECCA UPLOAD! FINALLY!😩🙏
Everyone: watching  Me: :0i want a magic picnic stick
Got a lot of laughs from this video :)
I guess you got your evil behaviour from your mom
Oooooo.  You were a bad girl...😂🤣🤣🤣
Not me running away from home at age 13 to not interact with my abusive parents :/
No entendí bien pero quedó nice
The video was funny
Yes!! Becca you're back . Great to see you active again!  💜💜💜

Nice vid
I think everyone would try to run away as a kid
Becca: *runs away* Mom: *Doesn’t care* Becca: "My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined"
I was wondering: why don't you have a mouth?  thumbs down for no mouth.
Fnaf phase
Becca, you look like your dad and Rachel looks like your mum!
It's #5 on trending
It's actually pretty normal for parents to immediately try to blame each other for a lost child.
Practical joke for Latinos is an A-- whooping.😅🤣
2:43 Rebecca just lost her body
Love your videos keep it up
1 Corinthians 15:3-4 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:  1 John 5:13  These things have I written unto you that BELIEVE on the name of the Son of God; that ye may KNOW that ye have ETERNAL LIFE, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.
Pleas give me a sort out

Funny, I thought I was the only one who grab some form of fabric, put random stuff inside and tie it at the end of a stick as a kid. However I didn't do it to pretend to run away, I did it because I saw it in cartoons so many times that I wanted to do it too just for fun lol.
congrats! #4 on trending!
Coooooooooooooooooooooooooool stuff
I want that book and bag but can't have it
0:24 Becca, why do you have that handkerchief bag on a pole, commonly referred to as a bendel popularised in the 1930s as a way to ViSuAlIzE THE- are you running away? Me: WHAT THE-

we did a similar prank on my dad but instead someone left the front door open before he got home and when he asked where I was cause i was supposed to be home that day (I was driving with my mom and brother from school) and my mom told him I must've ran away and he panicked for a second before my mom said "just kidding". after a minute he said "don't do that" and we were all laughing
HOW IS HER HAND WRITING AS A CHILD BETTER THAN MY CURRENT HAND WRITING (i also completely relate to the sixth love language)

OOOOOO
My family messes with each other too!
So... My phases in like 2/3/4 grades is.....    🌌☄️🌠 ADDICTING GALAXY🌠☄️🌌    ❄️🏔️💙 CRINGY ICE PRINCESS' 💙🏔️❄️
I wish I had a family like that. Mostly my family ignores me until they need something from me. As the most tech savvy from the lot, I would be called whenever there was a printer to be installed or a phone to be fixed, then I was rewarded with a pat in the head. As I was lacking affection from my family, I thought I was in heaven! Not all families are made equal...
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding. Proverbs 9:10 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. Proverbs 3:7 Jesus Christ is an awesome God, The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy. Yet God, in his grace, freely makes us right in his sight. He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins. Romans 3:24 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and with his stripes, we are healed. Isaiah 53:5 When Jesus died on the cross for humanity’s sins, he did it because he loved us so much that he didn’t want us to suffer an eternity without him. Atheists love to proclaim that God is cruel, when God took the punishment for ”your crimes” so you wouldn’t have to, how is that anything but merciful and kind? Salvation is a free gift of God, not of works (based upon our performance) should any man boast. Ephesians 2:8-9 All we have to do is accept this gift. by proclaiming our sins aloud to God Almighty, admitting Jesus Christ is God, that he was Crucified and Resurrected on the third day. If we do so Jesus will forgive us and we will belong into the family of God for all eternity. In our own pride to do things our own way it only leads to our own sorrow and destruction. By thinking by our own righteousness we can enter into heaven and we can’t ”’ But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousness’s are as filthy rags, and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.” Isaiah 64:6 I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance” Luke 5:32 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Romans 3:23 I was once an atheist, I believe a lot of the same things Hitchens did, the truth is Hitchens as with a lot of atheists are mad at God when God has nothing to do with the bad times in our lives. ”It rains on the just and unjust alike” Matthew 5:45 It is Satan who wants you to believe that God hates you, so you rail against him. Satan wants to destroy you ”Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:. He hates humanity because God loves humanity, just as Satan eventually will be destroyed he wants as many people to be destroyed along with him. Don’t believe the lies, you’ve been told. God loves you despite your past, and your trials and tribulations. He wants you in his life, in his embrace. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. 2 Peter 3:9 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16
Don't leave the picnic stuff! Anything but that!
4:11 to 4:21 THIS PART MADE ME LAUGH TO THE POINT I NEARLY NEEDED TO CHANGE MY PANTS WHEN HER MOMS FACE TURNED INTO THE GRINCH 🤣🤣🤣🤣
wow my 2nd grade writing
My sister said she 'ran away' a lot, but my parents have a completely different story: they said that whenever she got mad, she would get a pack of goldfish, lay down on the trampoline in our _backyard_ , and would stay there for like, 10 minutes until she got bored and came back. I don't know if I should be laughing or concerned that no one even bothered to come get her-
https://www.gallbox.com/
Yay I was waiting for this video for weeks and I am not disappointed great video like always and mysterious ending uuuuh scary 😱
yeah let's run away from YouTube coz it's s**cks
When I was a little kid, like around 5 or 6, I packed my little Shopkins suitcase (Omg remember when Shopkins was a fad?), and started walking down the street, angry because my parents had just spanked me. My suitcase had snacks, clothing and apples, so I sat on the road and ate them. I made it around maybe 15 yards down the street before turning back and going home.
You have defiantly been missing from my life. Finally a new video😀😀
Rebecca: I never ran away because neighborhood parents wouldn't let me Tabbes YT thumbnail: Getting run  over with nobody caring
Bruh
Request: make a video about the times you cried about the times you were hurt as a child I will sub to your channel
4:16  Imagine deciding to do a Grinch reference and then realising your art style means you can't draw an evil smile.
Oooh, I love the backpack! Gonna check if it's gonna fit in my budget, the price is really chill though.
😆😆😆https://youtu.be/qWKDJRL_Ob0
OMG FINALYYYYYY A VID!!!!
I sense a Halloween special coming soon... >:)
Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)^

I never, ever fathomed the idea of running away as a kid, so props to you for being the typical weird kid ^^ And, good on your parents for being responsible and smart.
Didn't even wait to see the whole video; I liked this the second it loaded. :)
Have you thought about making a animation of playing cup head the most game raging game ever
“Because dad bought it; hook, line and sinker!” Hm, I wonder where Becca gets her awesome acting skills~ 😏 Must run in the family!
Hola desde México ❤️
They should make a animated explore section on youtube
I’ve always loved your animations but this video hit different 💖
The slow disappearances of the food on the picnic blanket is a really small, but amazing touch.
i legit had a tractor phase
That’s 6 pumpkins too many
3:58 you cant even be mad because its true, every kid that runs away will eventually come home when their hungry its a fact lol
That ending, tho...      Halloween is (probably) gonna be good this year!
"MORE AT 8!" so, hows that doing?
Question l. Am I an explainer, an entertainer, or an oddle lolly?
its u  youre back😁😁
I love when she posts
best dad of the year
Hello dear! (:
i am one of the people who made a genuine, real, plan to run away and would have gone through with it if not worried about my brother. planning on having him help me get out
Amazing video
How the frick did you manage a perfect Grinch smile without a MOUTH!?!
how'd you eat that sandwich without a mouth
Yet another episode giving perfect example of how kid logic works
The grinch animation tho
I LIKE
4:19 The exact expression my mom makes when she pranks my dad for the 9th time in one day. Hilarious every time! xD
nice picnic but that was just someone else who was hungry wyd you run?
OMG, this is the best video I have ever seen ❤X100000000000000000000 I will share this video as much as I can
6:20  me when my cat is trying to eat my arm            note: my cat actualy trys to eat my arm
4:14 to 4:21    SOMEBODY CLIP THIS   And compare it with the origanal
Shes back! Hello Rebbeca love your vids :)
present Becca: and pretended to live in a house in the woods. hah! Running away to a house in the woods. The things children come up with. Past Becca: *I WANNA BE A GHOST STORY!*
Apparently when I was a baby if my mum put my down in the driveway I would just run and not look back. She always says I learnt to run before I learnt to walk and I honestly believe it. Naturally she caught me every time but she will never let me forget it (even though I don’t even remember it in the first place)
Have you ever think that you will run away from home but you weren’t going to do it
Cool
It's you! :D
Wow beautiful
I won’t stop until you say now I gotta tune out
7:32 That's a THICC 🎂 you got there, Rebecca...                 Can I have some?
The whole phases thing at the start reminds me so much of my childhood with adhd and autism. Not every kid that goes through phases has both or either but it is common and my special interests and hyperfixations ruled my life for the periods I had them
Grinch Mama
𝐁𝐑𝐄𝐀𝐊𝐈𝐍𝐆 𝐍𝐄𝐖𝐒: Small dumb child is found dead at at nearby park eaten (or nibbled, idk) by rapid squirrels.  Please come and claim your dead child today before we sell it's corpse on the Black Market. Don't worry, people always buy what's on sale...
Ah, a fellow wannabe runaway. I myself am quite adept at running away from home. All the way to the small patch of field that was, like, 5 metres away from our house
that intro never gets old
Love this show so much  😂
Okay I should be commenting on the video but that picnic/food art is amazing
I had a dinosaw phase when I was a kid love you becca>3
I knew a kid who ran away from home he for some reason tried to climb a telephone pole and he ended up falling down and dying it was in the middle of winter but I don’t know why he did it.  Very non cheerful it was very well awful to say the least.   Kids don’t run away from home.
SHE HAS POSTED
Apparently I was both weird AND stupid as a kid, cus I ran away from home twice :D Once, I ran away and wound up staying at Church because my kid brain went: "Who would give me a place to stay without question?" and the answer was: The Vicar. He gave me a book, talked to me about why I wanted to run away, and of course called my parents. I still have the book to this day. Second time, I ran away and decided I would just.. Live on the beach from now on. Totally not a crazy idea. I remember eventually going home and being really upset because noone had even noticed I was gone, lol. (I was gone for a day). Lmao, I was an idiot.
Lol
Yay u posted :D
When I was 10 I wanted to be an astrophysicist
You ran away from the truck backing up with your 500+ pumpkins at the end there.  D:
https://youtu.be/myAMXfV-h9c 💔

I press like before even watching
You really are the witch of the woods-

#2 on trending
“She’ll come back when she’s hungry” Yeah that’s pretty funny
Why haven’t you made videos in so long
The grinch scene mmmhhh
I love the story
Hello :0 Love your videos Rebecca!
LETS TELL YOUR FATHER
I also did the baby blanket on the broom stick thing, but instead of hiding in another room, there was a mess of trees between the neighbors and our house. And in those trees was a circular clearing. That's where I hid. Could have gone farther, there was a whole trail behind our house leading to a cemetery that my folks could have easily driven to if I needed them. But I was a coward, so I never did.
Pumpkins???? Ohoho me thinks the Halloween video is going to spooktacular
Has anyone noticed that her hair is in a grinch pose and her mom is the grinch so that means they are the grinch family
To the one who has ears to hear, let him hear this message   Don’t play games with you’re soul Jesus loves you so much as you can see from what’s going on in the world things have changed and you probably wonder at times if things will Ever go back to normal ?   the answer to that question is no. God is allowing you to see just how evil this world is and you’ve seen so much that should make you think and ask yourself is God speaking to me ? Is God warning me ? yes he is and God will judge this world but God is patient with you and with all Not wanting any to perish but all to be saved   Today and even now is time of salvation make the best decision you can make in this world and give you’re life and you’re heart to Jesus Christ and accept Jesus as you’re Lord and Saviour doing so while understanding this fact that eternity is forever with no end And no such thing as time in eternity    God loves you so much God doesn’t force you to accept him but they are consequences for rejecting the forgiveness that God offers to you through Jesus who died for you as a sacrifice for you’re sins   God wants to forgive you and save you but you need to stop running away from God the bible says all have sinned and are guilty before God but loves us so much that he made a way for us to be saved   the judgement of God is near with all that’s happening in the world the earthquakes the volcanoes the vaccines it’s obvious that something is going on and you need to get right with God because you’re sins separate you from God. God doesn’t want you to Go to hell which Is why Jesus died for you In you’re place paying the price for you’re sins   receive the forgiveness of God in Christ Jesus today   John 3  For God so [greatly] loved and dearly prized the world, that He [even] gave His [One and] only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him [as Savior] shall not perish, but have eternal life.  Whoever believes and has decided to trust in Him [as personal Savior and Lord] is not judged [for this one, there is no judgment, no rejection, no condemnation]; but the one who does not believe [and has decided to reject Him as personal Savior and Lord] is judged already [that one has been convicted and sentenced], because he has not believed and trusted in the name of the [One and] only begotten Son of God [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind, the One who alone can save him].   This is the judgment [that is, the cause for indictment, the test by which people are judged, the basis for the sentence]: the Light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil. For every wrongdoer hates the Light, and does not come to the Light [but shrinks from it] for fear that his [sinful, worthless] activities will be exposed and condemned  . But whoever practices truth [and does what is right—morally, ethically, spiritually] comes to the Light, so that his works may be plainly shown to be what they are—accomplished in God [divinely prompted, done with God’s help, in dependence on Him].”” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16, 18-21‬ ‭  For the wages which sin pays is death, but the [bountiful] free gift of God is eternal life through (in union with) Jesus Christ our Lord.” ‭‭Romans 6.23  2 Peter3   9The Lord is not slow to do what he has promised, as some think. Instead, he is patient with you, because he does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants all to turn away from their sins
Really amazing story! The prank and your sister and mother’s skills of acting where hilarious!
new video !!!!!!!!!

Huh... Suspicious ending...   LOVED the video though!
4:20 creepy
You know when there’s that girl there’s gonna be something juicy!

YOU FINALLY POSTED!!! YESSSSSS!!! also love the video.
ALSO I WANNA GET THE MERCH!!!!!!!!! BUT I HAVE TO RELY ON MY PARENT'S FOR THAT AND HERE I AM 21 YEARS OLD WITH NATURAL (Not Genetic) AUTISM AND TERRIBLE EPILEPSY (Just survived my 16th seizure in early August of this year) AND CAN'T DRIVE OR ANIMATE LIKE YOU, JAIDEN ANIMATIONS, THEODD1SOUT, SOMETHINGELSEYT, TABBES, TIMTOM, TOMSKA, OR THE REST OF THEM!!!!!!!!! I WISH I CAN BE LIKE ALL OF YOU!!!!!!!!!!!! I WANNA BE A GHOST STORY TOO!!!!!!!!! THAT INSPIRED ME SSSOOOOO MUCH TO LIKE HALLOWEEN AGAIN INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT IT OF HOW IT WAS FIRST ORGINATED AS CELEBRATING SATAN BY THE ORIGINAL NAME ALL HALLOWS EVE!!!!!!!!! I'M GOING TO CELEBRATE IT *YOUR* WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FINALLY NEW VUD
Congrats on trending
When Rebecca posted a vid  You know the story will be epic  Also keep up the good work :>
I went through my running away phase somewhere in between middle and high school. I also never had any plans of actually going through with it, but the idea fascinated me, so it became sort of a theme in a lot of my writing and painting.    I think I might have talked about it a little too much in creative writing assignments, because the teachers totally got the counselor on me.    Now that I’m an “adult” the idea of living in the woods alone sounds wonderful. Christopher Thomas Knight is my role model.
I have gone through a military phase lmao
I LOVE THIS STORY IT APPLYS SO MUCH TO ME AND MY PAST!!!!!!!!!!! WHEN'S THE NEXT VIDEO REBECCA!??!?!?!?!??!?!?!?! ALSO WHO WAS THAT THAT HID IN THE BUSHES YOU WERE GETTING AFTER?!?!?!?!?!??!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!

I love your videos 😊
It’s so funny that you literally are not getting bitten by ants or mosquitoes during the WHOLE THING
Ah...ive missed her videos.i havent watched her for a long time 😀
My parents ran away from me, at least that's what I told my crewmates
Man now I'm jealous that she has a healthy enough relationship with her family to be able to love messing with eachother like that. Me and my family would never be able to do that
And have corona virus
I tought you are sick rebecca
I like how she just runs away without moving her legs
O: im early

Her animation improved a lot from 2017
Idk why but ur intro’s make my day better So thx for that Rebecca
What the actual f am I watching? Lol trippy...
There are still some who stand for the Lord and the Truth of Jesus Christ! The Lord is faithful- even for one.  This is a time of testing and endurance in true faith. It’s easy to run away, to attack, to hide in a group that agrees with all your beliefs. It is much harder to stand alone, where God has placed you, to pray on behalf of an unrepentant, wicked, and stubborn people that do not deserve the mercy and grace of God.  Are we not any different without His redemption?  It is very hard to stand as one in a sea of many who are blind and deaf.. yet the Holy Spirit of Christ abides in His people and will be a refuge and a fortress! He will dwell with those who seek after righteousness and His glory. Jesus Christ, Yahusha, is the only leader I serve-  Wherever  He calls me.  Is your faith ready to be persecuted? Are you ready to be hated and still pray over those who hate you-earnestly? Is your faith one that seeks after truth and honor in God above all else- all political facade, all mainstream diversions and lies, even all your own personal beliefs.  Are you willing to surrender everything to the Lord- even your comfort, your security,  your life? Your faith must be refined and purified- or you will hear the words,  “Depart from me.  I never knew you”
Thx for uploading

Good joke 👍
you should do a mini series! kind of like helluva boss or hazbin hotel but not so extensive episodes and just in your regular animating style! it would be really interesting! and i'm sure your creative and weird mind can think of an interesting plot!
426 pumpkins!? Foreshadowing for a big Halloween video maybe?
IM NOT LATE I SWEAR
This is so relatable !!! I went through this phase too.
I ran from home in real life spent my all  my chilldhood in the woods

Once when I was 4 or 5 me and my friend who lived next to me hid in the trees behind our houses for like 3 hours pretending to have ran away, her parents almost called the police and all of our parents were crying, they found us when they heard us giggling.
SHE'S BACK :D
I always love your they make my day !! If i did that to my parents they would probably kill me, bring me back to life, kill me again and bring back to life with black magic this time to suffer for eternity

Guys if your a kid or a parent be aware of running away and make sure you always know where your child is in their early years even when the are with some other adult unless you know they will 100 percent not do anything. And if you are a kid never Ever EVer EVEr EVER EVER! EVER!! RUN AWAY FROM HOME EVER!!!
Bruh your hand writing was great when you’re little
Jesus Christ died and rose again for you to be saved from hell.God calls all people to repent and turn from there sins and to keep Christ commandments for eternal life. The Bible says unless you repent you will perish in luke 13:3. Revelation 3:16  Jesus talks how lukewarm Christians will not enter heaven. If you call yourself a Christian but deny Jesus with your life your going to end up in hell. I love you enough to tell you the truth please take this urgently your soul is on the line. YOU ARE NOT SEEING THIS BY ACCIDENT.
Last video 'Becca didn't finish the intro, this video she didn't finish the outro. I support the equality.  Really digging the variety this video has to offer, like the sudden news flash, the sneaky pause to add a passing comment, and the whole idea of using going outside the treehouse with a picnic to tell the story. (and, of course, the handkerchief bag-on-a-pole being the picnic)
I'm in my cow phase
Before this video I watched prehistoric spongebob and Patrick eat prehistoric Mr crabs
Yessss u finally uploaded !
Do a video called pranks and family's or something about the sixth love launge
Yay your alive
That grinch reference tho
The slow disappearances of the food on the picnic blanket is a really small, but amazing touch.
Yo new vid yay
You're back yaaay 😭😭😭😭
Half our generation: I was weird but not stupid.
Congratulations on your video trending!
I was quite early but I had an exam this morning so I didn't watch the video.  Also, I'm really excited to watch this! You are VERY very high on my 'Favorite YouTubers' list, Becca!
Finally it's been so long since you posted love yout work!! ❤
Aah... The teasing each other. My family have that language of love too. Some times it's fun. Sometimes it can be anoying. But I wouldn't change it. ❤
oh nice, she actually uploaded.
You're mean one Miss Grinch lol🤣
Its been 3 MONTHS
426 pumpkins aye?
Noice
Hi um I don’t know why I’m commenting maybe it’s because I like to comment on every video that I see anyways love your Vids LOL😃😁
I WISH YOU COULD MAKE ANIMATIONS EVERY DAY SO WE DONT HAVE TO THINK YOUR DEAD!!!!
She had NO mouth, yet she still nailed that grinch grin!
OMG 😍 I love your content. Your animation looks adorable and the storyline kinda same with my childhood.
Why your dad look like Ned flanders mixed with Jerry from Rick and morty
Holy shit…. THREE MONTHS. Damn I missed you
Can we agree that Becca is officially a cottage core queen👑🌻🌳
Not me actually running away from home more than once
Hello everyone hope you all are fine, I'm Thakshila from a little village in Sri Lanka, my village is full of nature and culture,so I'm doing a YouTube channel called "Thakshila _ girl in a village" this is the link https://youtu.be/k3hTS6Hy4kc Thank you 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
This was brilliant 🤩 now I’m wondering what those pumpkins are for
She brought an entire cake out there and left it.
You know what I always wanted? Is a toy looking like from the future
I love that this is #2 on trending, only beaten out by Soccer highlight
I had both a dinosaur and pony phase- however space scares the Frick out of me... but funny enough... the dinosaurs and ponies stuck around...
Its ok I was a weird kid im still kinda weird even with my learning and communication disability lol
"I will give you my address when I find it" Galaxy brain preperation
The cake, grapes, apple, sandwich , lemonade and I think that was tea? Was very tasty. The story of your prank was hilarious. Thanks for inviting us to you little picnic!
so happy for new animations!
0:52 kinda sus
its cool that my family isnt the only one who uses messing with eachother as a sense of love :)
*chef’s kiss*
Epic intro
Yeah 👏👍💜💙💜
Who’s gonna finish the rest of the food?😅😋
Rebecca is definitely planning something big for Halloween and I love it 🥰  Can't wait to see what you have planned 😃
Kids....they will do the craziest things I swear 🤣🤣🤣 thank you for the laughs
Currently minecraft, art and roblox phase is what I remember
i relate to this on an abnormal level
I just remember you exist yesterday last ep same thing happened like I have I gift
5:12 Imagine being eaten by squirrels 🤣🤣🤣
How can she eat whith no mouth
I am in a fnf phase also know that it’s Friday night Funkin
Wish I could buy something but they don't deliver in the netherlands 3:
4:17 I was a little fascinated by this animation so I played it on slow motion. It doesn’t look as incredible. But it was kinda hard for my two brain cells to take in. Sorry Becca.
I tried running away from home once. I didn't even make it down the street.
Why is the writing better than mine
I do that too and is was epic so so sooooo epic  My note to my mom and my dad  : Hello mom and dad i gonna run away and i gonna be ok but i just going camping but bla bla bla maybe i gonna come back 1 year again  love you guys and i gonna lost on the Wood so bye   XOXO love you guys goodbye - your sweet child Sidney Yeah i say that with a evil children sound
i really fell  bad for your father but the story was great i love it.
426 pumpkins? Why the extra 6?
This video is wholesome
Making adventurous games in your house is one of the best childhood memories of mine 😌😌 making tents with blankets , the stairs to the attic was going to a castle,  and trying to find a secret door in my father's study which would lead me to an enchanted amusement park 🤩🤩🤩 those times
Mrs Potts at your picnic!
#Gematria
You know your tree house can you make a mushroom 🍄 house pls
And you know what , i still am in that pony phase and i love it ❤😎 also that aj figurine is awesome - 0:53
I tried to run away from home but I gave up after i got caught
By “Bindle” Do you mean a bundle and stick right?
Something that apparently happened frequently when I was in my toddler years was me running away from home. And there was one time where I had ran away to a grocery store across the street from my family's apartment and actually got found by a worker there.  And he brought me to a police officer.....and I almost got taken away from my parents that day...   *yeah I got grounded big time afterwards*
Best picnic ever!  This definitely brought back memories of some of my own childhood shenanigans!
Lovely video and all, but I can’t escape this feeling that you are building up some sort of lore here… are you preparing some Let me Execute Studios alter ego? Redbecca Bloodham? Demonic Baby You?

4:22 LETS GET YOUR DAD
When I was a child Id randomly hide in places to prank my parents that I disapepared but when they get back in the room I pop out and pretend I was there the whole time. But I guess my stupid pranks backfired on me when I got older as even when im passing by casually my parents say the didnt see me or they'd get shocked when they run into me cause they dont hear or see me and honestly it hurts cause its like im invisible 🥲
4:17 Grinch :l
where's her mouth?
i once got into a bottomless manhole :l
Running away sounds like a fun idea, until you remember how hungry your ass would be
Hm...wonder what made that noise in the woods?
Hope it’s another Halloween ghost story next episode
EARLY
How do you post so fast? Jeez take some time to yourself
YAY A NEW VIDEO :)
So glad to see you’re back becca
I didnt go through a dinosaur phase i wanted to become a dinosaur and still love them
Well consider me surprised and I only say that because she said too no one's surprise.
Were you watching grinch when making grinch faces?
Who else sat through those last few seconds in case something popped out of the bushes?
Dads really be like that do 🤣
"Ahh running away to a house in the woods, the things children come up with..." me: .-. ...but you ran away in a house in the woods-
*Me: "what is a home?"*
The ending makes me unsettled. Like a jump scare that never happened or that feeling that that pile of clothes on your chair is something else watching you from the dark. I LOVE IT. Wonder what was causing the rustling though.
"I will send you my address when I find it" that killed me
Yaeee
HOLY COW IM EARLY
It would be funny if a wild squirrel came after you at the end.
Oh... Ok see ya around and thanks for the story by the way 🌈 ❤ 🌈 ❤ 🌈 ❤ 🌈 ❤
HEY REBECCA THIS WAS A GREAT VID BUT OMG WE HAVE THE SAME HANDWRITING
hmm.. that moment at the end.. could that be a set up for the halloween episode.
Me who can even step a foot outside a house

I still thing it would be funny thinking your kid ran away just to find her in your bathroom
Hmm deja vu :/  But amazing vid!!
✌🏻
Why didnt i get a notification to this? :(
6:16 when that one over powered killer finds you in the most easiest hiding spot
That's very funny, but no joke if I were your dad I would have divorced your mom on the spot for being part of that lol
Another great video, Becca.  Also make sure you watch out for those carnivorous squirrels out there. LOL.
when i first watched this it was an hour ago
My sister tried to run away once... She was not very successful, since she decided to go while we where out delivering papers, my mum was driving in the car to move us from street to street, and she went down a pedestrian path between houses, that didn't have any places to turn of, so my mum just met her at the other end and made her get in the car.
love the Grinch refrenes and the red glowing eyes of your mom great job
“No he actually did that , he blamed my mom immediately “  Best Husband/ Dad right there folks
You are the only animator I know that can post something in a month  Take a rest
It’s crazy how she can make the characters show emotion without mouths
I was preparing for a suprise jumpscare at the end- even made my dog sit next to me and turn my volume completely down until it fully ended-
My brother tried to run away at the age of I THINK 6…. But he wanted mum to drop him off 😂😂😂
I think when I was 6 I'm on my superhero phase I never thought of running away phase then on 12 yrs old that how now I started that phase
I know that evil part of you is some where in that tree house
Sheeeeeees baaaaaaaack
Imagine just Rachel banging on the door like: Rebecca open the door I gotta use the bathroom  Kid Rebecca: NO THIS IS MY HOUSE!
long time
I’ve been waiting a whole 2 months for this 😭😂so worth it
I remember that phase, not in my life, but somewhere
the 200 people who disliked this video was bribed by the devil
AMAZING VIDEO!!!
AMAZING VIDEO!!
Yes another video! I love your videos!! Your my favorite witch  <;
all kids are weird
Was that Mr muffin behind the front door?
POST MORE PLASE
THE ENDING????
WAIT HOLD ON - at the very start of the video, where she promotes her backpack merch, notice how the direction her hair moves in the opposite way it's supposed to, am I the only one kinda perplexed?
Bacc yey
the queen is back!!!! <3
How does 3 grade Becca have better hand writing than me and I am in high school
0:55 Applejack 🍎✨🍎✨🍎✨
So why do you need so many pumpkins?
awesome job again, rebecca!
You did it better than me
Love u so much 😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍
Haha
Where am I there is a tree house I hope Candyman can find me
i kept waiting for a jump scare at the end 😆
Yessss she finally posted I love her vids their so funny and I love to watch them lol
Ahh...she finally came back.When you said 'space phase pony phase and space phace' I immediately thought of me dancing BTS songs..... don't judge it's my coping of quarantine
Just let me Explain
Man i remember runjing away because my mom doesnt wanna give me the candy and eventually returning
What's yall favorite iconic phrase of hers? Mine is "I WANNA BE A GHOST STORY" Ofcourse
Not gonna lie this is so far my favorite video also love the grinch grin on your mom looks really cool 👏🏻👏🏻💕❤️  Edit: I love the picnic vibe though
9hrs
Ok
Epic
Ah yes, the sixth love language. My family knows it all too well.
My one  phase was SONIC
I had a faze where I thought I was psychic and I also kept having a dream where I was spiderman but the webs that came out of my wrist felt like a rope being pulled out of my wrist
Damn, 3rd grade Becca’s writing’s is better than mine…and I’m in grade 8
We can use ur backback to run away
That grinch smile from your mothe rwas amazing and the fact that your mother pranked your father is just funny and hilarious. What a good and fun bunch.
congrats on #2 trending 👍
After a bit so great b-day, this video made it better!
I think we all where weird kids- my entire kindergarden class ripped up the playground lawn because we got taught what dinosaur bones where and that "they could be under your feet rignt now!" We didnt find any dinosaur bones but it was still fun :V pretty sure the school was pissed but I dont remember it enough to know if we caused the "dont rip grass out of the ground," rule at our school, we got fidget spinners banned because some kids *cough cough* (me) got scammed into buying fidget spinners ;-;
I love her that the fact that she greet and call us very sweet things like my little oolalies lol
Why was I expecting a jump scare at the end.
Don’t you leave us on a cliffhanger!
Yes she's back
I missed your videos!!
Can I have some of that cake and lemonade….please?
:)
Yes! I ran away now im uploading a new vid tomorrow for my new album:) it was worth it!!
finaly
00:36 I wish I could set up a picnic that fast lol
Ohh her video is here
Tío vine a ver si consigo subscriptores para mi canal viendo que videos son tendencia y me encuentro con esta chica bueno igual Good video and very great  animation
OMGGGGG YOUR SO PRETTTTYYYY SSVFGGGFG GG  Aaa T
OMG SO COOL
Hiii
Q: Rebecca, what happens if you draw me instead?
It's been 14 years and I still haven't gotten out of my emo phase lol  But I'm definitely not as cringe as I was before
I had a Michael Jackson phase in 4th grade. I’m in middle school…. I think I was a bit late to the party ;-;
Yayyy you uploaded!
I can't get over how everyone loves to mess with each other, my family rarely cracks a smile at something remotely silly.
Me having a suicidal phrase since like 5 years old 👁️👁️
The eyes and the scream
2:07 I never knew her parents were related to Michael Jackson
I nearly chocked on my food when he found her
So... Why specifically 426?
made me laugh, awesome vid
I had a fnaf phase ;)
E
(Kinda) Early

Google razorwraith 🌚🤘🏾👻👹🌋😈🌹
“Some of us as kids had a dinosaur faze, a pony faze” me as a child rocked both at the same time DINOSAURS EAT THE PONY!!!!
me at 14 still in the dino phase lol (I just like them Im not obsessed)
That Grinch smile was weirdly terrifying without a mouth. Also, holy crap, I can't believe your mom kept the damn letter!
im still in the space phase.
BE READY FOR THIS VIDEO TO BE THE NEWEST ONE FOR 2 MONTHS
where did you find that sinister violin music? I've been looking for it forever
I just wonder how you eat food with no mouth🤔
the times i thought of running away as a kid were not like this but i'm glad you had a laugh out of it :)
have you played minecraft before in your childhood
*Totally not me rewatching the mama grinch part again and again cackling my head off…*
Such an awesome story. Loved it so much
Not gonna lie, but Rebecca's mom making the original grinch face without the devious smile but still nailing the face is pretty amazing.
congrats on trending
When she said she was weird not stupid I said to myself so I am stupid ok
I had all tree of those phases
great great great grandfather said its my turn for my comment to be pinned
Claim your heat before 1 million views ticket here
E man
This was a delightful way to end my day. You continue to astound with your wholesome and crazy art style and stories. I adored every frame!!
4:19 No point making a Grinch reference if she doesn't have a mouth
I am very over stimulated rn and this is helping thanks
Some good heking content
Woah woah woah woah.  Your one of THOSE kids. The peopywho have the overly neat hand writing
The animation was really nice today. I upped my video quality just to appreciate it. I also like the detail of the food being slowly eaten to show the passage of time. Keep up the good work.
Once I tried running away I packed everything that would be useless on the run (stuffed animals pictures toys etc) my plan was to live by my nearby CVS, I said goodbye to my sister sneaked out the window went to the backyard gate. It was locked so I kinda just…. Went back inside and unpacked all my “running away necessities”
Her hand righting was so good as a kid   I’m not even that good at righting
Rebecca, The Fact That You Don't Have A Mouth Is Why I Love You
Sussy  baka
☠ my brother went Behind the dresser and fell asleep me and my mum thought he left the house and went on a whole search for a good hour my mum was about to call the police but then I found him
My family has that same live language.
to be honest I did run away before lol but here's the thing I survived out of the house for 2 days and I WAS SO PROUD!!!!!! I did starve a bit but it was worth it in my opinion. btw I ate some berries and chips. (I brought the chips)
I have always dreamed of running away as my family is just entirely awful and the situation has gotten worse
Ok the singing in the beginning IS SO GOOD ur so talented Becca
Lets goooooo upload!!! Thanks LMES! God bless you all and Jesus loves you all 💙
- realises that its nearly halloween- :0
Well, is she gonna tune out!?! I need to know!!!
Let’s be honest we all had a corner of our room/closet dedicated to our weird obsession
And Friday night funkin  Is a video game
lol my parents do the same
A Friday night funkin phase
HAHA I love the grinch reference!
Yo, you didn’t even say you were gonna tune out… how am I supposed to know if I should leave the video or not?!?!
Yayyy new video
"I think grown-ups just ACT like they know what they are doing."  Calvin and Hobbes
you made a perfect video human
i remember doing something similar, i just sit on a tree pretending i run away from home and singing castaway
you've been gone for 3 months?!? damn those 3 months went by fast it felt like last week u posted 😨
I think I was in like first grade when I was in that faze? I never saw it as a joke cuz I'd only think about it while upset. Not sure if I was a dramatic kid, or my parents didnt understand how to handle kids then. 👀 But yeah. I got kinda close one time actually leaving. Nothing came of it, but I really had a half @ssed plan to leave
Omg I love this YouTube Chanel and the WITCH OF THE WOODS
Twig snapping, Rebecca hiding, ominous silence..... I think we are entering the scary month
I WANNA BE A WITCH
I’m pretty sure most people had Car phases
I went through a princess phase when I was 4 or 5 where I would dress up as Disney Princesses depending on my mood. I had a Hello Kitty phase when I was 8. I'm currently going through my Pirate/ Historical Fashion phase. I just bought a fashion corset and a cloak for this Halloween. And I am obsessed with Sea Shanties.
SHES BACK EVERYONE SHES BACK AT IT AGAIN with another storytime 😌👏👏
7:06 Kebecca Parham
Do a dad prank story
How was your hand writing so good 😭
So cool video
Squirrels actually do eat meat.....there was actually a recorded incident where some of them tore apart a dog.....and ate it...
That Grinch smile was beautiful especially with no smile
bruh sussy
You have the best mother and sister ever
I was always in the tech fase
5:39 Look closely at the door.   Mr. Muffin from Tomska is hanging on a picture. (Fun little Easter egg) =)
Rebecca don't kill me please
Me who ran away three times and planing on doing it again: "I was forced to get in a cops car three times then almost got put up for adoption. :)"
Hmm, order of pumpkins and an odd noise in the woods at the end? What’re you planning for Halloween, Becca? (Great video by the way! Love you ❤️❤️❤️)
Ooooh your bluff got CALLED
first 500,000
Been awhile
dont read this    you mean changing? learning finding new things?
Excuse me where is the “I am tuning out” why you left it on a cliffhanger why why
Ehe, I’m 20 and just started my pony phase
when I was little me and my sister said that we were leaving the house because we were mad at my mom and older sister. We were outside and thinking if we should leave and just to clarify it was NIGHT time...so as I was say me and my sister were thinking of leaving but decided not to when we went to open the door IT WAS LOCKED me and my sister started to bang on the door and telling my mom to open the door and they could hear us but wouldn't open the door until they opened it then me and my sister were laugh so hard. THE END
i had a ceniozic phase
Becca, are you going to be in a sincere pumpkin patch next vid? 😁
can we just talk about the ending for a sec- WHAT IS SHE RUNNING FROM
The backgrounds are amazing 👏
i wish i did that when i was young
While watching this i got an add about shoes that said “ pack my bags and run away” Also don’t we al, have the sixth family trait, messin with eachother
Wow thats nice rabbeca.😃💖👍
I love that the mom was all in on pranking the dad immediately 😂😭
Why does your mom and dad kinda look like beth and jerry? lmao
Lol
Omg Becca you sing so Beautifully that I thing think you should make a new channel called “Let me Sing Studios” where you could cover some songs for come up with news ones! Also great vid!
6:12 this part was so funny 🤣
AMAZING I LAUGHED
I'm still in my Thomas The Tank Engine & Friends phase!
Finally! I love your channel and at 0:08 The singing was great
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Funny story, I went through the “I was diagnosed with this and I didn’t know” phase.
I love your voice ♥️
WHY MISS PARHAM I AM SHOCKED AND APPALED. You just left 7/8ths of a perfectly well made CAKE out in the WOODS!
You make my childhood look boring lol
I once tried to run away 😂  Edit: This just got me to laughing
TBH running away was a common thought but hard to go through with for some. And its very hard. first, you would have to prepare food then make sure you keep a low impression when you see your parents you also have to keep parents side tracked and get rid of your siblings who potentially snitch on you, then... ESCAPE. but what would I know... I have never ever tried it... <:)
I love your videos :)
Not me waiting at the end of the video covering my eyes ready for the jumpscare
If only the merch shipped to Aus, such a shame. At least the video was amazing as ever.
THE GRINCH REFERENCE. OMG
0:44 no
A wild Rebecca appeared! Runaway? Catch? Give food? Watch video? * video is clicked * Like? Comment? Sub? None of them? * you pick *
Lol my fam have 6 love too…..  FROM ME! And they can’t take a joke.
That moment when an 8-year-old Rebecca has better handwriting than you.
Imagine her neighbors just hearing her scream
awwww man i wanted some of that sandwich
Ok whenever I was a kid and my mom would get mad at me I would always act like I run away but then run back home😂😂
This is sort of like how me and my younger sister have grown up, I used to annoy her a lot but now we're both chill around each other and every now and then when I get dinner at college I'll get some sweets as well for her, and vice versa when she's out of the house.  We used to argue like crazy but now we stick by each other, like a load bearing wall in a house we both hold up well when we stick  together,   and of course, who else can agree mischief is always fun when you have an accomplice to help out, when we and our parents bicker, it's a good back and fourth at each other but nothing hurtful
hi
Omg finally. YOU POSTED!
I successfully "ran away" once as a kid. I forgot what my mom and I had an argument over, but when I was six, I marched out of the house and started walking. My mom didn't think I would actually do it, but I started off in the direction of my aunt's house. I probably would have gone all the way, but my mom went running after me once I got to the end of the block and showed no remorse.
*WE MUST GO FORTH AND RETURN THE SECOND BORN TOO HER RIGHTFUL PLACE, IN THESE THE HALLOW HALLS OF CASTLE PARHAM*
Ha one time I tried to escape when i was like nine but then I remembered that day was pizza for dinner day so I never escaped :3
This is TOO easy to relate with.
FINALLY SHE UPLOADED
i had a love for dragons as a kid
He He, i had a phase for running away as well. But i actually left the block with a backpack and food and stuff inside. And my mom helped me pack it cus she knew i would be coming back, cause i cant carry all of it cause i was carrying like 12 plushies. :T
Things you should NEVER do or ask someone  A woman: her age A man: his salary A Rebecca: do you want a treehouse
HELLO i love your viedos sorry about the spelling
if you didnt have that prank on a parent that went horribly wrong did u have a child hood at all?! ill never forget mine it worked so well on my mother because i got my teacher to play along...who quickly let my mom know it was a joke.....my dad didnt even give time for that when we tried a home version....never pranked my dad again
I just wanna know what she’s doing with all of these pumpkins.
I remember a very vivid dream when I was 7ish of walking out of my house in the dead of night pulling a wagon, making it halfway down the street, and turning around. I don't think I actually did it...but it's weird how I still remember it. Also: eating Halloween cookies while watching. Happy Spooky Season!
i once thought of running away from my emotionally abusive mom
Ah yes just gets up and leaves vodo magic stuff am I right?
The pride, happyness and loss in your voice brings back so many memories of my own father.  Thank you for the story and though others may of said this to you....you have carried on his memory to so many others and even today he is still inspiring fathers today.
I remember something like that...I was 16 and I was going through some rough sh*t. Mom moved away,  my dad and I were distant, grades were falling and I was going through that anime phase where I wanted to go to Japan...only made it to LAX.
PARTIALLY EARLY
Could 426 pumpkins be alluring to another episode
That Grinch scene though
what happened to the 426 pumpkins?
Mommy, Can We Get Jurrasic World?  Mom: No, We Have It At Home Jurrasic World At Home: 6:18
Notice the artistic amazingness and focus on the picnic and how the food slowly gets eaten!!! Love the channel just please make more content faster?

i went though a frog phaze
6:18 We'll Be Right Back Moment
Bacca is a great singer and the animation in the opening of the video is beautiful ♥️♥️♥️💐
7:38 It must be the animatronic from his house
Good ol, kid logic back at it again
I loved my time in latchkey what I usually would do there during my free time is play some pool get exhausted playing just dance 2016 and then eat what ever food they would serve up it was fun, oh and we also did melting beads
1:13 is it weird that 8 in my time zone is in 2 minutes lmao
So ✨wholesome✨
You know now that I think about it, your sister looks like Pacifica Northwest from Gravity Falls
That forest scene with the picnic all set up is so beautiful! It'd make a wonderful computer desktop background!
...i waited till the end of the video to see what happened.....
When i was a chilled i did want to run away from my home... but because my family situation outright awfull
2:30 Congrats on achieving to walk home after the incident
Ye
E
Hey! she’s back!!
The ants appreciated the cake you abandoned in the woods and would like to request you bring another  (07:44)
Sooooo looooong
I’m not that good at art, but watching Becca’s videos inspire me so much. :]
FINALLY YOUTUBE REMINDED ME ABOUT YOU WHEN ITS MY BIRTHDAY
I liked after the intro :)
me when I see the end of the video  "Mat-pat has trained me for this. There is something bigger going on. LetMeExplain Studios has convoluted lore now. I must discover the secrets. What sound do I have to play backwards? what cipher is hidden in the background? what if I watch till the end? if I go to the source code of the YouTube channel, what will happen? I MUST KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON! what if I
Can you make a second channel if doing something else on the second channel
That food looks really Good
7 hours ago????? Nice-
Very funny video, the other comments say it all, but what I cant see to find anywhere in the comments is people talking about the noises at the end?!?!?!!!!! WHAT WAS IT? WHY DID BECCA RUN AWAY?? GUYS, I THINK I SENSE A BIT OF A STORY HERE AAAAAA
Omg 😲
Oooo fiesta tea cup
Yeah.... The second you said you were gonna prank your mom, I got Vietnam flashbacks to the credit card and bully bite incidents.
When someone says about space well... I think too much about space when 3,000 years we will die and sun turning into a supernova all stars die and our universe full of stars die and other...terrifying stuff
Oh You're alive cool
My family has a 6 heart to messing with each other and saying your feet stink pranking each other and all that stuff
I loved the ending lol
♥️ I remember u when u had under 500 k 🥲
😳🤚
Me? A picnic? With Rebecca? 😳
Lol i remember why i ran away from home. my sister scammed me out of 25 cents for my ninja toys from those quarter vending machines so I packed up my toys into a backpack and "ran away." aka I went to the opposite side of our block, climbed up a tree with my toys and books and stayed there all afternoon until my teacher found me in the tree. we lived a block away from the school and there's six of us kids so all the teachers knew us. interrupting her evening walk, she convinced me to climb down the tree and escorted me back home. I got my ninjas back and even got some money for new ones.
as a kid i once pulled a prank on my parents, so i made this costume out of a box and then one day i pushed down the stairs and pretend screamed my mum thought i was in the box i was grounded for a month p.s i am a only child so no one was there to stop me
I actually remember a YouTuber named ginganingaowo that also lost her dad and I’m sorry for your loss
Mmm the phases in Latam are quite different. More like : mmm what if I join a gang.
oh no, the [REDACTED] forest cryptid got rebecca
😂 lol sound like your dad was gone blown off the full forge your mother didn't have a little smarter
OMG I MISSED YOU SO MUCH!
I wasn't worried about the bag-on-a-stick thingish thing, I was worried about where you went for the amount of time you were-
I never really thought of running away in my life.
Your mother is so alpha. She has my respect. She is so cool
I’ve been stuck In my space phase since…. Well now, currently only have 3 degrees left!
Your dad thought it was 2v2… little did he know it’s been 3v1 this whole time lol
Okay, how did you know about my pony phase that I still have right now.
Dang 7 hours ago
YOU FINALLY UPLOADED
BECKA!!! hi
Who else pause the video to read the note?
THE GRINCH REFRENCE
Your handwriting is third grade was awesome I’m in high school and mine is worse
i ran away for almost 4 hours starting at 8:00 pm to 11:45 pm
Every time I see little Becca’s hair do the horn thing I get Mandy vibes
I ran away at around 5, my mom saw me packing a bag and didn't stop me and kept saying " you can't take that, we bought that. " thought that not having anything would deter me. I ran anyways and she actually panicked and tried finding me. Was found 3 miles away in a field. I told the cops mom said I could leave as long as I didn't pack a bag. She got a talking to (Gotta love small town life). I was then bribed with candy and soda not to tell my dad.
Bahaha
😘☺️😍😊
When your mom rolls with it. XD
I am going through a anime stage.
welp she forgot her food ITS MINE NOW
I was just going through my recommendations when I saw a sly sneaky girl lol.

Rebecca is a snack and a half. Love the grinch animation sequence.
Ahhh the end I'm in suspense, I waiting for a jump scare! 🤣
Wow! Your videos are getting funnier. I'm really liking the jokes in the video.
New video!
Her hand writing as six year old is amazing. Like I’m impressed
Well, running away is easy. But it’s the leaving that’s hard
I love your videos and how your so mischievous
Ah crap I totally forgot you existed for a couple years but I'm back baby
"ROOAARR!" "AHHHHH!" "ROOAARR!" "AHHHHH!"  I keeled over laughing at that part 😂😂😂😂😂
I had a yoshi phase and yes  he’s still  my favorite character

THE GRINCH CALLBACKS YES
Oh my gosh!         My fam as a 6th way to show affection too!
Now I will watch the entire video pondering how that cake fit in the bindle without smooshing
A rebeca and a technoblade upload, this is the best month
I actually did try to run away a few times as a kid like I didn’t have a bad home life or anything like that my parents were good and all that I was just a literal demon as a child
we better be seeing those pumpkins for the Halloween special
my god. first stores and now youtube. is it just going to be normal for the holidays to be vibing in september?
I actually did this once. Got grounded for some stupid reason and decided to bike away with a bit of water, some pocket change, and my library books. I just rode around the neighborhood on my bike a bit before getting caught by my dad's mom and forced to go home lol  Mom was not too happy about that one.
That . . . Was epic
"More at 8." I check the time, and it's just after.
0:50 lol that’s me
Ahh u never finished the ending
Oh jokes on you Im still on my dinos phase since I was 7 years old
Praise God 🙏🏾🙏🏾
Wish I had that. I tried to run away from home because my so called mother was emotionally abusive... I was walking down away from home until a neighbor found me and drove me back. You have a nice family Rebecca.
YES SHE IS BACK                   ALL HAIL CHICKEN NUGGEYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
i really like how she draws the kid pigtails like little horns its very fitting
I ONLY CAME FOR THE CAKE GIVE IT NOW
Rebecca, your animating is SO. GOOD😳🤌
FINALLY THE BEST PART OF MY MONTH
AFTER 2 YEARS FINNALY THIS GITL UPLOADED YAAAAAAA I LOVE ANIMATIONS LIKE THESE
I had a similar story, but i ran away less far only to my front yard.
When I was 3 I used to get angry at my mum so I’d get a suitcase (that was the same size as me) pack it with ONLY stuffed toys and undies then I’d yell to my mum “IM RUNNING AWAY” then she’d wait at the end of the drive way watching and giggling while I walked down the street and sat there for 5 minutes got hungry and when home. I did this til I was 7
Your back im facking up
sat whatever you want, that is a good dad
You male the most enjoyable videos✨  P.S I also "ran away" from home. I put some toys and seasweed crackers in a tea towel tied to a stick and sat either on my trampoline outside or under my clothes line
OK BUT LIKE R WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT HER BEAUTIFUL SINGING AT THE BEGINNING😩✋✋❤️
Quick and random question… When did your needle phobia start and when was the first time it really freaked you out? Like I said… Random question
*Mouth has flew into space*
Our question how is your dad doing
What a sweet and humorous story.
HELLO BECCA I LOVE UR HUMOR OK BYE
That forest background is just **chef's kiss** so nice
I died at 4:15😂😂😂😂

Rebbeca Why in your old video you have a mautnya
Hey Rebecca I love your story 😂
It's too good
The grapes slowly vanishing be like
I had a pony phase too

Rebecca have you ever shot a🏹?
Who didn't do this
FRAME THAT NOTE
Love how she was singing Betty boop
One of my phases are... Alot weirder! I had a xenomorph phase,from the movie alien.......
5:20 this is me in winter when someone takes a snow block of ours
awww that ending was super cute and sweet
I loved the Grinch Joke you made,And this story reminded myself of my good ol childhood,I can't exactly quite remember of what my age was back then....but anyways My Older brother who is a grownup had to watch me when my mom left to get something's,but a thought came to my mind as I looked at the door and thought to myself that would anybody noticed if I left,and if memory serves me right...It was raining outside and it was Nighttime,As I basically put on my raincoat and walked out through the backdoor, but was hesitant to actually leave the house without adult supervision,but eventually I made my mind up and walked my way out of the house and closed the back door,I honestly didn't know where I wanted to go at all but I was passing up next to a local store and then a cop car randomly drove up so I started running...but the police car eventually drove to me and the officer's asking me if I had a home and I told them I did,So they basically got me in they're car and drove back to my house,Of course my brother was angry and my mom was angry as well when she got back, That's basically my story
Hahahahahahaha write a note with the runaway and ended up hiding in the shower with glasses that can barely see through
Ah yes another upload from Rebecca. I'm always so happy when I see her upload. 😁
Wow it's been so long since you have made another video
Fnaf and furry phase go brrrrrrrr. Never left those phases
thought about this when i lived in an abusive household.

OMG I JUST WATCHED ONE OF UR FIRST VIDEOS BUT I JUSED WATCHED THIS AND OMG THE IMPROVEMENT 🤩🤩🤩🤩
I love how the mom just join in with the prank 🤣🤣👍
Woah that ending. Kinda creepy just in time for the spooky season

Hi , I am from brazil
OMG it’s been so long since I’ve uploaded and I miss your videos are so funny
Becca you rebel.
NO COME BACK—YOU DIDNT TUNE OUT
That is my life
I mmmhc
My dad once tried to run away from home, and just snuck out the window and started walking and then after walking for an hour or so he realized that this would lead nowhere and just walked back home to find my grandma taking a peaceful nap :')
Bruh- why that ending so ominous tho >_>
Hi! Can you plz make a vid on how to animate cuz i want to be an animator just like you
When i was really little i did um shit and my parents locked me outside for like 2 hours  i actually climbed over our backyard fence and actually, seriously thought of running away lol
Okay but lets be real has anyone done one word comment
Hi I missed u
Why is your child handwriting better than mine
YES YOU UPLOADED IM SO HAPPY!!!! 😁😁😁😁
I played this exact game! I didn't get as far as the prank, but I played this. Mr. Parham might be a sucker.
YouTubers Aren’t as energetic as they are on camera…… ALRIGHT SO WHO WAS GONNA TELL ME THIS
Oh crap  A DEMON
Broj what ya gonna do with all those pumpkins
Becca!
One tjme i tried to run away but I forgot i lived in a apartment and i thought my apartment was haunted that time so i never ran away again
anyone else has every phase she named with the pony, dinos, and space? Just me... ok
omg your still fliming  number one fan
My oldest sister once convinced me and two other of my siblings who are younger than me to hitchhike to Hawaii from Florida why'll my oldest brother and the babysitter played cards... Are only problem was we couldn't cross the street without an adult present!!! So we walked for 15 minutes round and round until we saw a parents driving back home and we tried to run home but they saw us....
Funny this came our after my oldest brother ran away lol
My runaway note just said "I knew you would be happy if I was gone."
A new post yay ur alive
Finally, the queen has posted a new video, thank you
wait really?
Rebecca: I know what you are thinking right now.    Me:  A. You're going to tell us another amazing story of the adventures you had when you were younger? B. Where did you hide the bodies?  C. Who goes on a picnic in the middle of the woods anymore?   D. Where did you get that awesome stick with possible food inside it?  Me: *Sees the Video* I actually thought it was A.  Well don't i feel dumb for not picking C.
Not me waiting for you to come back and finish your channel outro quote 👁👄👁
Yay!!!!!! New Video!!! I have never been more happy.
6:18 lol
Note : “I’m running away” Becca’s mom : “Oh no!  .. Anyway”  Btw I also make videos about life
Ello
I never wanted to run away, but I've always wanted to sustain myself in the woods for a few days.  I'd live out this fantasy by:  1. Squishing wild berries into "soup" 2. Making somewhat edible food from did in my friend's garden 3.Using litter in my apartments treeline to make huts 4. Pretending the rooms in my house were clearings in a forest while my sister chased me around  I still wasn't a cabin in the woods, sounds fun
Thank you for drawing the crosselbow i needed refrences
*sigh* Becca's dad.
yall dont even know how excited i was when i saw this video on my homepage
Odd, you post this the VERY DAY that my friend runs away from home.
Before you leave can I have a slice of cake. It looks so good 😊
I remember going through a similar phase as a kid, but for me it was more for the sense of adventure 😅
fanily after 90 day we get a new video yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeees
But more importantly, did you ever your 426 pumpkins delivered?
I'm convinced that Rebecca's dad probably wasn't that smart
im not joking. ive had such a good day today. i got my favorite drink (fanta), and i just took a shower, and honestly its going too good. now that i see L.M.E.S. posted something, its going so amazing. ty for posting <3
3:18 And you were really shirking the concept of taking responsibility yourself, Becca. 😂
Uuuuuhh Becka is back🥳🥳🥳
I can SO relate to this
Funny story when I was like eight I tried running away, I got my backpack, my Michaelangelo action figure (tmnt 2012) and something else
I ran away a few times , the only times I left my estate were out of fear tho
NEW VIDEO LETSSS GOOOOO
Everyone: focused on the video Me: How does she eat her picnic food without a mouth?
6:18 RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
426 Pumpkins?! what the what??
Oh my god you where a riden child to your parents. Also your sister really jade have stop you from doing that prack. It's good think that you didn't really run away from home at just a young age. There are a lot of sicko out there as well as a lot of dangerous animals. So thank you for not really running away from home
what was the ending tho
she is back
The #running #away
AHHH the picnic vibes!! I LOVE. The food looks delicious :o
How can I still see that Grinch smile even with no mouth?
I love animations
The Grinch reanimation with the mom was SUPER well done.  Great video, Rebecca!
Yeah we have the sixth love you to but they get real mermaid Revenge I was weird too
i live for these videos.
Am I the only one who walked home when they were 6
5hourrsago!?
when she says my little odilallies :D
I actually did it once, immediately regretted it.
omg your back i thought you died !!!
It been so long since I watched you videos
You always make my day better :]
I have been waiting FOREVER.
I was just thinking a couple hours ago, “ I wonder when she will upload?” And she uploaded 3 minutes after I said that.
POG
Please try to post more!!! I LOVE your vids and have watched ALL of them!!!
Rebaca hi! How ya doing?
Every kid wanted to do but they where like I don't have [̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ιοο̲̅)̲̅$̲̅
This is off topic but have you thought of playing Gartic Phone with RubberRoss, Odd1sout, JaidenAnimations and whoever else feels like playing? Its pretty cool
Your art skills are amazing!
"A dinosaur phase!"  Me: .. Phases last your entire life???
so excited ive missed your content <333
The backgrounds of your animation is so beautiful ☺️☺️
How did younger Becca have the same handwriting as me? Wow
I missed u
How come none of your stories feature both your big sister and your little brother? Maybe you could make a video about your transition from younger sibling to older sibling.
Love your vids they always find away to make me smile!
Omg
I actually thought of this when I was little- We all had a phase like that.
Once my dad got angry and yelled at my brother so he decided to run away with nothing but his underwear. He got to the edge of the street and then turned back.
I’m 15 and I’m still going through my dinosaur phase, ur not alone Rebecca😅
3:16 I'm literally just now recovering from soda gushing out of my nose because of just the note they basically wrote. Ughhhh it burnsssssss but LOL the parents may have lost ten years off their life from that stunt
Lol so funny 🤣
Lol what your not a super energetic person!?!
I had a crusader phase
"I was weird, not stupid." Well at least you were Rebecca. I know I was both weird *and* stupid.    But who's dat sneaking around in the woods back there?
Hello becca
Oh wow! 😂 I love your stories so much, Rebecca! ❤️
Definitely haven’t stopped going through phases… also, the setup for Halloween is awesome 👏
That’s pretty impressive how she recreated the Grinch scene without a mouth
Yey Rebecca senpai is back!!!!!
The scream tho
Spider-Man: Running away from home
Honestly, Rebecca's mom is pretty cool for running along with the prank, my mom would've just grounded me right there (only for the afternoon though).
0:49 not me
OMGGGG she hasn't posted in too long !!!!!!!!!
It's been so long
What was that noise
I am weird to XD
Eyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy I love your videos 😁
Your animation skills are amazing
Nice seeing ya again beca, hope you are doing well
Hello
Oh my god I actually tried running away but couldn’t get the blanket tied to the wooden plank so I gave up
I went into a runaway stage as well
She's back😊
We all tried to run away when we were younger change my mind
*We all had that moment where we thought we were depressed when we were a kid— and we wanted to run away and thought we would just live our friends* 😢(;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`)
yep i got a gun phase and am still in it
4:18 😂🤣😂  Paging Mr. Karloff Mr. Boris Karloff
I got the backpack and its great! Love it so much, but the back straps are a little uncomfy TvT
Love the bit with mom having awful idea. I've had some awful ideas myself 🤣
4:13 grinch reference
not me waiting for a jumpscare at the end of the video-
6:13 ok why did I think Rebecca would see her dad peeing 😂
0:39 Hmmm...lemonaid, assortment of fruits, sammiches, spot of tea and cake? That can only mean one thing...  It's an Unbirthday Party! 😁
FINALLY
I wish i can prank my family but allas i can't they probbably kill me if  i even thought  of it 😅
Im literally on the verge of running away from home because of my dad.
My phases was twilight
*I wish I had a friend like you 😭*
Oh he will never find me in the shower go’s to the bathroom see’s his child wait a minute 🤔 opens * grrrrr ahhhh grrrrr ahhhhh
The screaming is to funny
Mom:when will come back      Me: stays    Five minutes later     Me :MOM
OMG YOUR BACK
Hi becca I love your videos❤ they make my day❤
why did you keep the letter?
Love that Grinch reference. That special was my childhood. I would watch it every time I went to my grandparents house. Even if it wasn't Christmas.
Ur so pretty 😻
I want to hear more stories about this family pulling pranks on each other. Like if you agree.
i lowkey think about running away because of my brother
I always find those videos parents take of they’re kids trying to run away very funny, because the parents just watch and say goodbye and the kid walks down the street, looking back after a while and slowing to a stop before running back XD
I've got admire her adherence to the 'no drawing mouths' aesthetic while also trying to draw a wicked Grinch smile. 10/10, very effective.
4:23 THE FREAKING PLOT TWIST
I always wondered when you were going to post again contents grate
Hey
i love the prank that you did on your dad great video
When her dad found her I was riding of laughter
Hi
i went a block at 9pm so i could get to my cousin's house                                                           not running away but its close
Guess for living in the woods there is a bit of a downside, wonder if it'll foreshadow?
I wonder if Becca is planning on inserting a lore type story into her vids, everything is so detailed you can hide a dead body in it :DD
oooo miss ma'am ,seting for a Halloween ep i see, may i say i am awaiting on pins and needles for it as your my number one insperation for a new oc,without a mouth,as mouths are hard with the lips
I hav to admit that i was disapointed when you said it was just a game for you but the joke made forget it great video Becca 😍👍
Becca should totally make a horror game. I would play it non stop
we all did this tho
Aaaa I thought she was going to runway
THE QUEEN IS BACK!!!!
hey rebecca how's you're day?
Ty Rebecca🤪😂
THE BECCA IS BACK !!!!!!!
Can you please bring back the geek is strong with this one shirt love your videos ❤️❤️
Finally our LEGEND is BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hi rebbeca it’s been a while
My FNAF phase never ended...
Am I the only kid with a armed forces phase
Tbh I'm in this phase rn  And I have a full stupid plan if I do run away  Despite knowing I'm never going to do so
XD I was that kid that actually started walking out the door and then my mom got SUPER pissed and yanked me back into the house so I couldn't fully prove my word that I wanted OUT of there.
I remember my run away phase, I went toy buddies house and told them i was gonna live with them. The not planned one was when i was younger and got lost.... till i was on the other side of town... which leads towards another town. By the time my dad found me it was like 8 at night. Oh the sheer worry and anger i felt in those eyes. And when mom got home oh i felt every ounce of her swing with that belt.... I never thought of it until I was older and they were fighting so I just said "ok if you dont want to be a family I'll find someone that wants me." Needless to say that got their attention when at 10 at night when there are wolves, snakes, and multiple other deadly things I just left they took note. And came and got me while I was asleep. Needless to say after that time we tried talking and working on it on our own. Didnt work fully but the fighting was less.
Sussy baka
Thought of it when I was nine, too much of a wimp to try
This reminds me of how I too went through that phase with my friends in 3rd grade and wanted to run away 🤣🤣
I WAS SCREAMING
I would be the kid that would hide under a blanket lmao I had the little kid logic of if i cant see them they cant se me
XD I was cracking up with this story
I love this animation!
HELP WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I USED TO BE CURIOUS AND RUN AWAY FROM HOME BUT NOT FROM A FAR DISTANCE-
Here is Rebecca’s note:      Dear mom and dad, I ran away from home to find my own life. I will build my own house and find my own food. I will find a job and get some money. And put up signs that say have you seen me. I will come and visit you and can come and visit me too. I will give you my address when I find it. Love Rebecca. P.S I love you I love you I love you I love you and I will miss you. Bye!❤️
Its a dream come true when you upload. Keep it up!!
I ran away once. The police dragged me back. and before anybody asks (nobody will) I was serious about it.
Did you get your pumpkins?
YASSS OUR QUEEN BECCA IS BACK
I generally thought that at the end after Rebecca walked into the bush that she would run out screaming as coyotes chased her. :T Yeah, I'm messed up.
I tought you were gone D:
Hey becca, have you seen the new Disney/pixar movie luca? Because if you haven't you NEED to see it it's amazing and watch the credits, there's after credits scene and there are illustrations in the credits. By the way I love your videos and keep doing what you love.
Sadly enough, your handwriting looks like mine
Bro, her mouth is detachable, I swear to god 😂
He did very well with the details and everything I'll give you this😁👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 I will subscribe you're the best😊
People thought that female gigachad didn't exist . . . but she's right here on youtube! O_O
I def had this phase as a child. When I was about 11 or 12 I almost actually did it. But I wanted to take a bath instead
How is it that I, a grown ass man, felt so happy being called an oota-lalie? I'm not even joking; she said it and my face just went 83.
WAIT WTH IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE OUTROCARD??? WHAT WAS THAT????
This was probably my favourite video of yours.
Once I tried to run away I made it halfway up the street I came back and asked my mum to drive me
Yasss queen you are alive!!!!
Anyone find the ending off? Maybe Becca isn't running away, but running FROM something :eyes:
I was waiting for your intro for too long  Edit: about the phases part of life, my minecraft, Hello Kitty, kitten, puppie, and kawaii addictions are no phase. They will stick with me forever. And I'm a 17 yo.
Spooky season is coming 🎃
NEW VID
I- guys she didn't tune out, are we,,, are we stuck watching Becca's videos forever she didn't release us hELP
*Runing away is easy. It's the leaving that hard*
It was all fun  In games until he died
my phase was guns
Okay but I applaud being able to pull off the Grinch smile with no mouths
Omg i was laughing through the whole video! 🤣🤣🤣
I had have a phase of unicorns and I am weird to and I used to run away once just going outside and coming back in
cuz im an international super spy~
getting more COTTAGECORE
This is the most stupidest idea.                     And I love it
YAY SHE HAS RETURNED FROM THE DEAD
That reminds me of when I ran away from school and I went home by myself
4:10 "I know just what to do!"
I’d low key would want a picnic with Becca. Just vibin’ it out in the woods, enjoying the comfort good foods, all while sharing stories. Sounds like a really fun time 😊
Dan da da
FINALLY
The Halloween season is upon us. I can't wait to see what will happen with all those pumpkins
Are you gonna finish that cake?
Rebecca: running away from home Rebecca‘s parents: get back here
Don't worry Becca I was like that too being a weird kid and yes I had a run away phase too, but mine was actually stupid. Six or seven year old me actually try to run away. Because I thought the world was like Disney World where you can find and discover new places. Not the dangers of it in real life. I tried this three times and my mom didn't know what to do and decided to show me a homeless shelter where teens who ran away got nothing, that is how my mom had to scare me straight into not doing it for real. So I  would do pretend run away within the safety and comfort of my home. I was weird, bold, and stupid until I learn to use the thing god called a brain. Since then I am grateful for what mom had to do because I volunteer to help the homeless and I am grateful to have a thing call common sense and a brain.
Noooo, missed opportunity at the end, you should have had a guy go "pumpkin delivery...miss? Miss!?"
Omg lol, I never had a phase like that, um I don't know if this is a phase but I got into weight training because I wanted to be as strong of a fight like Goku.........I mean it came in handy when fighting my way out of problems became my only choice.
It’s moments like this in my childhood that can keep me smiling 😊  Even when there seems to be nothing to smile about 💔❤️
BLOBBINGGGG
hi
everytime you upload it a nice refresher ,also i showed this to my art friend they love your style
I bet next episode Bigfoot will be a star guest
There is genius iwish I can do that as a kid
Finally a new video
I have to ask is your dad gone?
No fear bingo is here!            I came back in 2024 in a hunt for these comments from a while back. It’s very strange, but almost bittersweet to look at these. I’m keeping them up just to remind myself of this and potentially come back for years to come.
I love you I’m a fan
If I did that to my mom, she would have gotten a taser and yell, "we got a runner"
Stupid for all the trouble. That's could've been result of first responder/money involved then checks upon checks etc. Running away is not joke. Neither is anything else that bring things that gets out of hand real fast!
Wait please explain the ending
Dang, young Rebecca has better handwriting than I do now. We live in a society.
I never thought of running away, but accidentally freaked my mom out one time when I was six.  I was in my room. My bed at that time was what they called a "captain's bed." It was high off the floor with a cabinet, some drawers and shelves on one side. Sort of like a bed on top of a dresser.  I was reading comics and one of them slid into the gap between the bed and the wall.  Annoyed, I climbed down and pushed the bed away from the wall. I saw the comic, some small toys and a coloring book that had gone missing. I pushed the bed far enough out that I could squeeze behind it and get my stuff. That's when I realized how roomy the cavity under the bed was. The storage part was only about a third as wide as the bed and there was like a whole secret room behind it.  I grabbed my pillow, flashlight & the rest of my comics and went back under the bed into my new clubhouse.  My mom, who had been doing housework, peeked into my room to check on me. Not seeing me in there, she thought I must have gone outside to play. When she couldn't find me in the backyard, she started panicking. She went over to the neighbors' houses to see if I was playing with their kids. When she couldn't find me, the other neighborhood moms started freaking out, too.  I faintly heard my name being called outside. Confused, I crawled out from behind my bed and went out to see what was going on.  Mom was standing  in the front yard  with her back to the house calling for me. I could hear other ladies up and down the street calling, too. I came up behind her and said, "Momma?"  She was relieved and angry at the same time. After everyone settled down and figured out what had happened, we all went back inside.  When dad got home from work, mom, exasperated, told him what had happened. When he laughed about it, she got really mad at him.
Just reminding everyone that she has 4.2 comments in 4 hours. Truly inspiring.
i was always thinking of doing this at some point LOL
4.2K
w0w
Well, that was a nice picnic. I shall have to remember to check in next whenever for another amazingly animated adventure.
Why did she run away from the pumpkin delivery man, at the end?  :)
im still a kid and thinking of running away i got caught on my first run but 2nd times a charm!
Your looking good Rebeca😊
Thank You For Telling Me About Bindles!
EARLY
WE ARE BLESSED BY THE LORD, A NEW FREAKING VIDEO
I will pay 100,00000
4 hovers late
Here, I need lessons-
Of course, as soon as I start listening to bells of Notre dam the special kids movie that forever will stay close to my heart, the Disney lady appears.
Why does every youtuber have sales when I can't pay.  I think I have the same luck as Something Else YT
New video after 3 months
Most of the stores in my area had Halloween stuff up, so I decided to be a witch for Halloween, I had forgotten that you were the witch of the woods, guess I will see you soon! (｡･ω･｡)ﾉ♡
That face reminded me of Alice and wonderland
Take it from me, the best stories _always_ start with "(X person) had a wonderful, awful idea"  😂😂😂
Wait! I thought it was a real runaway story. I didn't know that was a prank.
Is.... is that a cliff hanger? O.o
Unexpected visiting...I would love to hear a story like that
Yay
I love your dark humour dude
Rebecca why haven’t you been posting I literally unsubscribed because of that
This gave me such a funny memory, when i was little my older sister and I played a running away game where we'd pack a small bag with snacks and drinks and then go our own separate ways of running away and trying to build our own home with whatever we find. My house at the time was huge, it had a front paddock and a back one too, so I immediately went into the back paddock because it had branches and a big wood pile for me to make a house, I also just loved to climb trees all the time. So I climb this tree that had branches thick enough for me to sit on, I play my bag in front of me and just has a juice box. I'm drinking away on this juice until I see many cows running down the hill, i had forgotten that our neighbors moved his cows to our paddock when then needed to be away from there's in case of flooding. I was stuck there with a bunch of cows surround the tree I was in. I screamed for my sister and she came out to check on me and realized that I have a huge fear of cows, she got my dad who was surprisingly calm and I made it out alive and I went into that forest all the time and eventually didn't care if cows were there, I was gonna climb that tree stack and nothing was stopping me! 🤣🤣
❤
a youtuber weird? noooo I never knew
the grinch face
Aw Snap! Pokemon Snap!
i just love that you show real life evidence of these incidents... like the letter... also the one in which you have shown the sketch, signature & fake dollar bill...
I read My Side of the Mountain when I was a kid. It was a coming of age story where the main character, an adolescent like myself, ran away from home to live as a wild boy with no hard feelings. Naturally it was a compelling survival story full of grit and sunshine and I wrote an essay that I wanted to run away to the wild like said boy. Spooked a few teachers.
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO SSY SPACE FAZE-
i love your videos, they make me happy again when i'm down
Another queen has posted
omg it’s been long
What are you going to do with all those 426 pumpkins Rebecca? Its not 31 Days of Halloween yet. We're still in September.
Lmao How do you remember all that in such detail when you weren't around for it?
Me seeing this video wondering how I didn’t click on it 4 hours ago
IM LATEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Mario YouTube channel icon looks like your style art love your videos by
I ran away from home once with only pop tarts, a blanket, and Mountain Dew, my parents were looking for me till they found me in the shed in the backyard I was hiding in.
Ok. Let’s all be honest. Who hasn’t thought of running away when you were like 4 XD. You pack your bag with your favorite stuffed animal and a bottle of orange juice and your on your way. Riding you scooter all the way to Africa to start a new life
YOURE BACK
Hilarious, though it reminds me of my own 'running away' experience as a kid. I can remember trying to do this around preschool where I packed a little backpack full of apples and peaches, and was planning on leaving. To make it even more hilarious, I was going to write a note saying I was running away, but I wasn't fully sure how to spell it so I went to my dad, who was on his computer, and asked him how to spell 'running away', where he asked me if I was planning to and I lied and said no. I never actually got to do it though, since mom came over a few minutes later and told me how much she loved me, so my guilt overwhelmed me and I ended up eating the apples and peaches at home.  Also Becca, your background in this is absolutely gorgeous, I envy your plant-drawing skills.
THE QUEEN HAS RETURNED!
😈
YOUR BACK YAY! And also, I can relate to this video.Also Also, Episode 2 of asking what your zodiac sign is.
Your funny
I am 10 and since I was 3 I have been in a dinosaur phase and I am going to be in it for ever cause dinosaurs are awesome
*When youe here early and could possibly get the merch:* _Stonks_
When her mom turned into the grinch I spat soda all over my computer, 4:10
So your mischievous side came from your mother I see. Your poor poor father.
Who else is thoroughly disappointed by not getting the iconic "I gotta tune out" and then not even getting the anticipated creep at the end that would have half made up for it?
Yay video
...
Awwwwwww so sweet 🥰
yay u posted again
Y a s s s
In almost every video she includes ponys  i think she's hinting at the fact that she's a brony and I'm here for it
Is no one gonna mention that part at the end where she hears a noise in the woods then runs away?
Aww wowi  Do
Imagine you imagining you imagining you imagining you imaginating this
Please post more ;-;
Why her dad's eyes be lookin like deku's from mha https://youtu.be/AcPPVZFixo8?t=129
My younger sister would get mad at all of us and proclaim very loudly that she was running away, and my parents would just nonchalantly shrug and say "ok" Then she would proceed to leave the house and sit on the sidewalk by our driveway for maybe 10-20 minutes before coming back
I've ran away from home a few times and loved it!
was not entertained.
Love your videos
Omg I've missed your videos so much. Great to have a new one 😊
Rebecca, what are you planning to do in the middle of the woods with 426 pumpkins?
Hi love you
You forgot the gummy eating fase when you get brasis
Mum the best at acting
That song Rebecca chanted was “I Have to Have you,” which originally became sung by  Betty Boop. That famous expression “Oo De Lally” has been obsolete in decades, although  it became popularized during 1950’s, which meant “Yippee,” “Yahoo,” lWahoo,” or just plain  “Yay.” That expression meant excitement brought on by any rousing game of badminton, birthday  parties, archery, tax collection, dating/having sexual relationships with older women and successfully  trespassing on the property of royalty. That expression was also an exclamation used during violent  sexual intercourse.
You know what I'm going to ask this how did your sister and Mom when breaking your dad did not even give a chuckle like I'm surprised you able to keep a straight face more like an acting face actually thanks for the picnic and I'll be on my way without a coyote now it's dead meat and also I can't believe you actually blame your mom and also who on your phone with
4 hours early :3
my aunt told me a story that when I was really young, my older brother and I got out of the house and walked all the way down to the next street where my aunt lived. Luckily a neighbor of my aunts saw us and took us into her house and we were taken back home. My grandmother ( who was watching us while our parents worked and my older sister was in school), was relieved to see us as she didn't know where we were. I actually kinda remember it too
I legit thought there was going to be a jump scare at the end so i panicked lmao
YAY SHES BACK BABY!!!
I actually did run away, when my parent's confronted me about being bi. It. . . it was a lot, to say the least LMAO
I want to hear more about your brother ☺️😊 you have a awesome family.
AHHH!! She posted!!!! I'ma watch it now
I runed away from my house to my grandma house whem i was in the 7 years and her house was literaly just a other side of the road XD
Yessssss more vids let’s go
Beca I've been wanting to start a animation chanel on you tube what drawing tablet do you use?
Hello!
This put a dumb smile on my face! Thank you Rebecca!😁
Gy
I had a violin phase a few months ago and now I have a violin sitting in its case on my couch and I don't know what to do with it because all my motivation has now drained away because of my dad.
can i just point out that the backgrounds are fantastic!!
Wow
EARLY!! Can I have a shoutout?
I love your stories so much Rebecca!!
Lmao
Im in the space stage at 17😂😂😂
I think my dinosaur phase never went away
I love how in the picnic clips food disappeared every time you cut there, amazing
Hey Rebecca awesome video plus your mom doing the grinch smile that was classic plus I hope you’re doing well and you’re being safe
Hi
I mean.. I want to run away right now. Because, long story short, being with my family does NOT make me happy at ALL. Soo yeah. This is fine :'D
Can’t wait for le spooky month
Wait who were you talking to when you mention 426 pumpkins? And you you looked at the viewer and said "ill call you back"? Kinda sounds like your animations have lore
This is Clearly Like escaping School  Because it’s a Nightmare.
AHHhH
Once in kindergarten it was morning and i hid under the bed because i didn't want to go to school and i hid so well that they were about to call 911 but my sister found me
I like the small detail in the video were the food slowly disappears throughout the video, but the only question on my mind is; how is she eating it?
ah shes back yay!
I lol
I wanted to run away as a kid because my brother kicked me in the face.
I had a phase where I would sit in corner and talk to nothing said my parents but I think they are because I remember talking to something
When I was a kid I did this  3 times
Another great video by an amazing animator! Thank you, Rebecca!
Your dad was pretty cool
She uploaded on my birthday. Nice :D
Can we all just talk about that BACKGROUND LIKE *FRENCH KISS* DAMM THAT'S GOOD >:3  0:08
Lol i havent wathced one of your vids in a month
"But now-" Now WHAT??? I MUST KNOW  /j
Dont leave trash at the forest! >:0 XDDD
Oh god, this just reminds me that i actually did ran away from home and my mother called the police to search for me... i walked 20 miles away till they found me.   Edit: if any kid managed to find this comment... DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING IT.
The only thing i can think is, “god d@mn it i worse handwriting even in high school
What was that end...
Great video
It always happens when kids have a horrible  home life  so they have no choice but to run away home Its depressing
I almost did that-
For her little picnic setup I would  have made the teapot and cup a Mrs Potts and chip.
LES GOOO SHE'S BACK
Finally! I have been waiting!   Also, YOU’VE LEFT THE FOOD!
Ayyy
41k IN THREE HOUR? THATS WAY TO MANY LIKES IN THREE HOURS
She had NO mouth, yet she still nailed that grinch grin!
Yes I Missed  your videos
NOW
RIED MY CCMMIT
Nice to see another one if your videos
Your... Alive
I was in a killing phase I'm still killing people
Wow who did not post in I don’t know like three months
I am in a tank phase. I know it's weird. Help me.
Aw 🙂
You gona finish that cake?
I had a dragon phase, which I'm still in
LOL THE FACE 4:20
If I ever live close enough to a wooded area I’m going to hang up a bunch of crudely made dolls, stars and crosses up in the trees made of sticks and twine. I want to see how many people I freak iut
I loved the grinch callback, Idk how i could see the smile without a mouth 😂
I remember when I was 4 I started packing my clothes and saying I was gonna leave the house because I had a  dumb argument with my cousin over something stupid
When I first saw the Screen shot I was like. YOU DID WHAT. But then I relised that I ran away from daycare twice so I'm not one to talk.
oo we getting lore now? what was dat rustling
244,627th!
I ran away from home, because I wanted to get to my mum, while she was on work. I actually made it to the train station that's 20 minutes away from home. No one stoppe me!
Why do I feel like this is something my mom would do to my dad. Kinda happened once.  I was what 4 and had a bad sense of timing. And ran out of the house down the street and suddenly it started to pour like a tsunami.  And I walked back soaked clutching my stuff that's soaked.
My family has a seventh one love/dislike
WOOHOO NEW VIDEO !
I couldn't run-a-way even if I wanted too as a kid, I literally had a giant metal fence with metal spikes that were actually sharp and painful to touch.   And in case anyone is wondering "What the heck is wrong your family?" I lived in NM state, that fence was to keep people OUT not keep idiot kids IN.  But also worked, because unlike my sister who just hid in another room pretending, I did actually try to escape.  Because when I say Imma do something Imma gonna do it, or at least try. I once just went to my grandparents who were right next door as one possible attempted, I got found pretty quickly.
May I have some cake?
The edgey phase
kay but why is  no one talking abou tthe weird ending?????
the best part is about my running away phase is that i was actually planning on running away like i had a whole plan down like seriously i had a plan for where i would sleep how i would get to school and a bunch of other stuff down also the fact i knew you had to pay for things like food and drinks and different stuff... with money, the thing is... i knew how to budget and when that comes into play, OH THINGS GET SO MUCH MORE FUNNIER, i was planning to run away to my dads house but whoopdy doo i didn't run away and the next weekend i stayed at my dads house and when i went to my mothers i regretted trying to run away, not because my mother yelled at me, because i realized... no. birthday. money HAH
New video yaaaay
0:52 well my love for my little pony phase is still here for the past 12 years and I'm 16 if that makes it seem better(it probably doesn't 😹😅)
The end was, … This terrifies me so much, like just this type of stuff send shivers down my spine. We might never know what made that noise.
How to get 420 pumpkins out into the woods.  Planning.
Reby ur alive!
Bad guy you've been even put some new video in 2021
You know its gonna be good when she says "my little odalalies"
Damn, you're lucky, and I'm glad this was only a prank. :O You and your family may be a mix of mischievous pranksters and total dorks or something, but you'll seem pretty nice either way, you'll sound like a lot of fun, a pretty nice family and all that or whatever. :p Pretty jealous honestly...
4:10 Love the Grinch reference, Becca!💚
I'm still hoping for more pins on her merch store.
Oh i really like the little creative animation bits in this, you did a good job
I have so many phases…Godzilla, Transformers, Power Rangers…etc etc
“
My mom kept a note I wrote to Santa asking him for a kitty statue to replace one my brother broke. Apparently I was incredibly thorough in placing all the blame on my brother.
I like how her old hand writing is better than my hand writing
Rebecca: idea of running away Me remembering: it kid logic
Im think about how to get out of school
one time my younger brother was sad because my parents left on a date so what he did was attempt to walk to them on foot even though they were like 30 minutes away. Thankfully we noticed in tame and he didn't get far. It was really loud after that though (Crying)
Becca's voice is so amazing🥺
That grinch smile was so grinchy that I didnt even need a face to know how grinchy that grinch smile was.
My dad is going through a getting milk phase, he’s been doing it for 17 years!!
Who else missed Let Me Explain Studios after 3 months
I remember a time when my parents did’t let me have gatorade instead of water so i wrote a note saying “I died because i didn’t get gatorade” hoping they would use gatorade to “revive” me
Finally after 3 months
its been 3 months where were u
This video is really gold XD
talented Becca showing off her amazing art as always... also, yeah, i would try to hide and pretend i ran away when i was mad at my parents, but my house has virtually no good hiding spaces so that screwed up lol  AMAZING Grinch face btw!!!!!
6:14 when i get caght playing video games at midnight😂😂😂

#runaway #away #home
Baby Rebeccas handwriting is better then mine….  …why
I laughed so hard at the shower scene!
I actually ran away at 13
Ok so I was stupid here is why one day I was just on my iPad then my mom said “come clean my room “ and I was in a bad mood so I got a little bag that was small and I got a stuffed animal and I water I went to…. The back yard lol I even left a message on the fridge that said “I will come back “ and my mom said what the what we’re you doing and ya😅😂🤣
turn to god repent for your sins and get educated on god
When I was little I would constantly try to run away my family try to keep their eye on me so I would rub off

Was that why last week I found an empty picnic with cake and lemonade
Jesus loves y’all
*l e t s  g e t  y o u r  d a d*
Awesome video as always
I had a TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES phase when I was little
just love how u vanish into the woods
Damn, you were just one bundle of chaos, an utter force of nature as a kid, huh? XD Wondering where how far life will take you for your sake if you so much as break the rules, and just how much life will punish you severely instead. :p I get it, it's kind of exciting isn't it, thinking about such things... even if there's no real point to it beyond simply experimenting with said chaotic or inactive actions, or whatever. :p  Funny how seemingly law-abiding you are now though, despite calling yourself a "Witch of the Woods" in your little cartoon lore. XD I guess there's no reason to be as crazy as you were as a child anymore and you're living the good life as a Youtube Animator and the like now. :p  Well, I guess I'm glad things worked out. :?
When you think of running away as a kid its fun and silly  When you consider running away as an adult its sad and depressing. Trust me, I kno    No but seriously great story Becca ^^
*finally, I’m somewhat early for a let me explain studios video!*
ITS MY BIRTHDAY THANK YOU FOR MY GIFT!
Ur back yay
sounds and looks like a talk show. except it's one person narrorating their life(not a hate comment)
Yes
Omg I missed you
*whispers* Its Bigfoot!
What was the noise?
1:39 thats calles forshadowing        If u understood the reference tell me who said it
Ah yes im early. im only the 218,176th
Rebecca: *explains how she faked running away* Me: why do I wanna do that now-
Actually I was thinking ,"wow you're alive"
YESSSS
what was that at the end???
Title + 2:47 = Evil genius card awarded to Rebecca Parham. 6:04 to 6:23 = Evil genius card revoked from Rebecca Parham.
👌
I'm gonna be honest, if you can save animations digitally and re-use them, that's worth it to get the videos out sooner. Your stories are always great.
YOU'RE ALIVE
Oh I had a dinosaur phase and I’m still in it 20 years later
That ending was so wholesome. 🥺🥰
she didn’t say that thing………SHE DIDN’T SAY THE THING!!!!!
One time I tried to run away and I got barely off of our property when my dad and brothers were coming home, saw me, and made me get in their car. I knew I wasn’t going to make it too long out on my own considering there are woods surrounding my house with coyotes and a bunch of other stuff, plus I was like 8 so I didn’t have any money and I couldn’t make any money. I guess I just wanna to blow off steam and I was still coming back but I still got in trouble. I don’t even remember what I was so mad about.
Daddy angry
I have nothing to say, I just wrote this comment to support you! Keep it up, these animations and story's are both amazing!
4:16 Gotta love that Grinch reference.
"I will send you my adress... when I find it"  That's hilarious
She managed to make the grinch smile work without the smile.
I DID THIS TO OMG-
One thing you should know you're like our only animator left once the Pandemic started almost everyone stopped
SQWEEEEEE THE LEGEND IS BACK! also i have had thoughts about doing this because i felt so upset at my parents, i never ran though.
WHAT THE [    ]
4:50 To make that slightly less cringe, I guess in context it was seemingly addressed to her and left on her pillow so assuming she might've had something to do with the reason why isn't quite that bad.
I’m a wired kid I’ll back you up
Finally!
When you're growing up as a kid, the entire world is your playground
Lets go we back
Hii
As a kid I was allowed to WALK by myself to the village nearby to visit grandma, but tbh she lived like, 7 km away... I'm 20 so it wasn't that long ago
Wait how are you going to eat the cake without a spoon or a fork?
My phase was and now is five nights at Freddy s
Plot twist the sound Becca heard at the end was her dad ready to tell her off for running away again
when I was I elementary school I literally just asked to go the bathroom, teacher gave me permission, grabbed my backpack and walk to my grandparents place all before lunchtime. they were a walking distance away and when they asked why I here, I told them I left school early. grandpa was rightfully pissed and mom and dad were not to happy when they heard what I did. oh youth :)
Was the cake good?
My phase growing up was about unicorns 😂😂
I said I was going to run away. For me "running away" entailed making a single peanut butter sandwich and gathering basically all my books before hiding in the closet with a flashlight. I left my mom a note saying I was running away from home and she found me a little less than 10 minutes later in my closet with a book and the flashlight.  Hehe Grinch animation
I love the grinch refrence lol
DIS WILL NOT BE GOOD FOR ME
This warms my heart
Ahhh finally!!!!!
ITS BEEN 3 MONTHS ARE U DEAD
I thought the noise was somebody delivering 426 pumpkins
0:10 Nice singing! (Also Finally I'm a subscriber!)
Finally u uploaded:)
This was really wholesome.
when arguably the scariest part of the  video was the last 30 seconds
Rebecca: "We all had that weird phase as a kid"  Me who still talks to my imaginary friends at 19: Who said it was only a phase??
I loved both girl and boy toys as a kid. I'm non-binary now. ^^ And I still love ponies, dinosaurs, and cars.
*me wondering how she took a bite of her sandwich without a mouth*
2:20 “Oh god she’s free BETHANY GET THE NET!”
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂
Rebecca: running away from home Houdini: 1st time?
hi
Even though the characters dont have mouths, I felt your moms grinch smile.
I really like your vid‘s and when I first got it watching I thought you having no mouth is actually pretty smart because it’s just hard to animate one of those
You’re just going to leave the picnic behind? Oh, such a waste. Also, what was that sound? A foreshadowing of something that will be a thing in the future?
Wish I could get it 😋😋😋
I have an infinity phase for space and Spaceflight, aviation, tech, windows OS, and architecture. I’m a MAJOR nerd/geek
*takes back evil genuis prescription card*
HELLO REBECCA! i just wanted you to know that i recently got cast in my school playyyy!
According to my mom I tried to run away but she told me I wasn't allowed to open the door so I just sat there are glared at the door. I was a stupid child Mom and I also pranked my dad once (well more then once but he bought this one) I had make some fake blood from a kit I had and put it on my knee and then when dad came home mom and I told him I had fallen down on the stairs (carpeted) and cut my leg open and mom had cleaned up the stairs (I don't remember what she said about why we were there and not at the hospital but she had a reason)
Is it me or does becca seem really mad at the term bindle?
Are… are you building a lore for your animated self, because that is cool
Ok, but can we talk about Becca’s singing in the beginning? I don’t know what the song’s called, but damn She’s good!
Yasssssssssssssssssssss
The Grinch face on mama Parham! 😂 😂 😂
When I was three I used to…, hmm run away from mum in the supermarket in the hide.
More concerned about how the sandwiches were disappearing
I had a megaladon phase. I had discovered the internet at around that time…
2 hours ago!!!!!!!
'i know what your thinking my head:cereal
I was planning on watching deltarune chapter 2 playthrough but okay nvm
@7:38 OOOOOOOOOH, I saw that! I saw that movement in the bushes!!!
Hi
Oooooooooo, spooky ending!!!
I early!!
Can we talk about how the letter was written perfectly correct?
I already ran away from home, I got tired of my mother complaining because I did something wrong, I jumped out my bedroom window at 10 pm, I walked about 10 meters from the house and then I saw some men smoking in the street so I ran back home, thinking they were going to make me smoke! yeah kids are stupid
Totally agree with the phases thing, I had a wierd one about the Titanic when I was 3(???) I don't know how I heard of the titanic, I don't know why it fascinated me so much but dangit 3 year old me could tell you more about that rusty ship than current me could tell you about my own bedroom
Meeting with each other is a valid love language change my mind
"...A pony fase..."  I FEEL SO CALLED OUT
I still have always thought of doing this when I got mad at my parents.💀✋
WTF
Imagine being smart enough to come up with somewhat clever ideas and yet, still being dumb enough to not really being able to come up with how to really execute said idea. It’s one thing being a planer, a whole other thing being a strategist.
You have a mouth??
How old were you? that's a great handwriting for a kid!
Well jaiden did say the bathroom was the worst place to hide
i love your videos so mush
i sneak out alot but could never runaway
Hmmmn. It's mid September. There has been talk of pumpkins. There was an ominous twig snap and spooky ambience. These signs all tease a Halloween special!!!!
:0
Where have you been it been years and I got my hair cut yesterday and I have school tomorrow(edit: senior year)
Ummmm lol
me whos still in that pony phase: 👁👄👁
:0
6:16 it was at this moment she knew, she stuffed up.
Cool
Dammit!!!! The jumpscare bait and switch again!! It's gunna happen one day, I know it!!!!
I used to run outside and stare at the road like "Should i do it?" whenever my parents yelled at me. Then I'd go back inside and hug them. Really lame.
It's the truth that when you get into a fight with your siblings
7:34 ..... Halloween is closing in
Whenever I was mad I would just walk out the door pretending I was running away but then, like mama parham said, I would come back when I was hungry or when I felt neglected and was desperate for an answer as to why they were neglecting me😂
Well the dinosaur thing still hasn't turned out to be a phase for me.  You said you were weird but not stupid, seems you were both...
My phase was an obsession of the titanic and I’m still in that phase
It brings a smile to my face to finally see you upload again
apple jack apple jack APPLE JACK
Nice grinch reference
>Latchkey kids OMG I knew I wasn't the only one who grew up like this as a kid. I just came home and was home alone for about 2 hours before my parents came back from work. I thought that was the normal thing everyone went through!
i too have a story like this: i uesd to go to my daycare everyday at age of..... umm..... 7 and my daycares appently had tow exists one the normal one and other from the back..... my aunt used to come to pick me up.... so what i did was i told my aunt to come from the front exit and i will come from the back exit..... i had did this couple of times before just for fun so she agree..... but that day my evil child mind woke up..... my mom use to go to her office by train and i had dropped my mum a couple of times before with my dad but i had never visited her office so i used to belive her office was in the railway station somewhere........... dumb me!............ so that day i thought to give my mum a suprise by visiting her office alone...... the station was a walking distance of half an hour but it would always take the car to reach there in ten mins so my dunbass thought it will take ten minutes to reach by walking too.... ok now its embarrassing..... so... and to reach there we have to go by highway. i was walking to my mums so called office when a man stops me saying where are u going i told them this and they handed me to the cops..... i told the cops my idea... the cops took me to my mums fake office.... that dint sounded well.... so they took me to the station only to know my mums office was not there.... luckily till the time i reached with the cops back to the police station i saw my aunt already there....... dude that was a lot of nostaligia
I a=saw this and was like yay SOMETHING INTERESTING unlike most of youtube!!!
I’m a phasing pro
She didn’t tune out……
<3
I may have been in my pony face for awhile 🥲
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm😤 I smell LORE😈  7:36
Let's go a new video
I had a whole plan- Slowly steal supplies from around the house, food etc, go to the library and then either hide there over night or take the bus/bike to a homeless shelter or continue staying at the library
Espada 1 this is Espada 2, consider this a gift from Espada me to Espada you... oh crap, he killed the rhyming guy.
wha... WHAT!!! What was that ending. it creeped me out.
Yeah, I  remember that I pretended to run away as well. I hid under my bed like 20 mins.
Even without the grinch grin, that was still kinda creepy xD
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!
3:00  dang she is livin the life she has a jumbo pencil why would she wanna run away
MAMA BECCA DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A MOUTH! YET I STILL SAW THAT ICONIC GRINCH SMIRK! DARN YOU DR.SEUSS
the 3,607 comment
I would totally be the dad in his adventuring get up.
My parents still have the "running away" notes i wrote to them when I got mad at them 4 making me eat my veggies. They even wrote down the age of when i wrote them. I even asked them why did they keep those notes
Awww let's gooooooo the drama queen is here to cheer us up yeah 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
She lives
Dad bought it hook line ans sinker  The best line in this video
OMGGGG I HAVENT SEEN YOUR VIDS IN FOREVER!!!!!
Something big is happening in the Witch of the Woods saga. Becca didn’t finish her outro, she’s on the run. But from who?
This girl is officially having too much fun drawing her backgrounds.
Rebecca: "Mom had a wonderful, awful idea"  The Grinch: Well, I just wanna say, I'm a Huge Fan...
Oven mittens XD
But then mom got an idea An awful idea  Momma got a WONDERFUL, AWFUL idea
4:10 *I'm laughing like Stitch in the first scene of his first movie*
This is the Frist time where watched this when it was posted 2 hours ago, 😂
Me and my dad once pranked my mom and pretended I was dead...  let's just say she got so mad she stayed quiet for 3 days.
"I'll give you my address when I find it", what a great line, well done young Rebecca.
Can we all just appreciate the fact that she drew so many trees for for the background
Made me laugh so hard on this one LOL I love you Rebecca yourHilarious thank you
EVERY and I mean EVERY person has thought about doing this
Who else was expecting a jump-scare from Rebecca because that is something she would do
Hi beca your back :)  How are you? I would probably also run away
I´m sorry, but his reaction when he opened the shower door had me laughing hysterically!!
SCARY GODMOTHER
Ooooo new video!
Rebecca engages in a bit of tomfoolery.
While I didnt do anything extreme, I did do that "I'm gonna leave, but I didn't actually want to", I was out near the door with nothing, and I was annoyed at my dad for some reason at 8 or 9, and I said I was gonna leave, he opened it and said "Okay, leave", and this kinda shocked me since I didnt think he would take me seriously, I remember begging to stay, and thankfully I did, he wasn't that bad
Hey Rebecca I'm starting a channel and if we could collab i could get more popular i hope we could collab for one video just so i can get a little fame
only the true MVPs actually ran away
YOUR BACK YYYYYYYAAAAAAAAYYYYY
The animation in this video is really good
i used to often run away from home, i literally grabbed a small tent from the attic, packed like one smoothie, and a chocolate bar, and went out for approximately 30 minutes, if even that lmao
Fun story: When my dad got mad at my sister, he kicked her out of the house for a while. This was normal as a punishment when either of us did something dumb. But my sister was done with this punishment and so when when my dad excepted her inside, she was gone. TLDR we spent the next 3 hours looking for her, just for her to reveal she hid in a bush to stress my parent out as punishment.
wow rebecca that is legendary😂😂😂
you remind me of my mom, i mean that in a good way
rip
YAS A NEW VIDEOOOO
With all of these really creepy spooky things happening in Becca’s videos recently, I’ll bet MONEY on Halloween somethings ACTUALLY going to happen- this is all just a huge buildup
hard stare: GREAT DEPression
Finly pls. Make more
You had great hand writing as a kid, Rebecca
I was so littel
Animation

I'm in a "drawing creepy furries" phase Wtf
I have to make a confession. I have never tried to run away from home 😀
You make me so happy. Thank you for making the content you do. Some days I just don’t want to be in life but watching your videos give me a spark of hope.
Yayyyyy more videos!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Hmm mighty
One time I said to my mum “I’m running away to grandmas room.”
Lol awwwwww I love your family
6:12 this could have been a LOT worse.
Early
question!! Did you like the Animaniacs Reboot? and if so are you going to watch season 2
I wanted to do that every time I was grounded.
Ohhh noooo! Rebecca's mom is doing the grinch from the grinch stoles christmas. I'm serious guys!😱
This is my second time being early today  Wow
why are your videos like eight 3 months
Hi
Rebecca:*showing new merch in the first second of the video* me:Mom!Where is my credit card?
Mine was history specifically World War II
I love your view your
Holding two different sets of liquids in a handkerchief bag without spilling is impressive, even for an animated character
Ayy you again
Yay

You're like to that one family member that we don't see as much but when we do its awesome
Lets be real guys this girl is amazing
That jump is in the animation boxer in funky Friday
I was obsessed with running away too so I wrote children’s books about kids running away to fantastical worlds when I was 10 I thought I was the only one obsessed with running away. It was for the same reasons. I didn’t hate my parents or family, just wanted to try it.
Yes this is relatable i did this two times but never went as far as the drive lol
Hi hi hi hi hi hi hi
lol, I like how u got all ur family involved to do that one prank on ur dad and u messed up big time. U literally had one job and messed up.
Me: *reads title* …What in the name of Kid Logic?!
I felt like running away once.        I went back home.
Y’all didn’t have a real childhood if you never wanted to run away before 💀
Why does  she sound  like  a news reporter  when she says rebecca  perrum  here I love it (think that's how you spell it)
AHHHH LOVE THE BACKPACK
Perfect the grinch reference there Rebecca
Becka I feel sick but u making me feel better
Great video
6:19 I love how she animated herself waving in fear! I love your stories and it always makes me and my brother laugh!
I love how when young Becca is being bad her pigtails are up like horns.
Honestly that pattern always makes me think of picnics because I recognize that first before the running away situation
4:17 this feels wrong without a mouth.
This video made me laugh so much. 🤣
How you gonna tell me a story when you dont got no mouth?
😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
0.29 tho
highlight of my day:)
OK WHERE HAVE U BEEN BECCA!!!!! THIS JUST POPEDUP AND THENI WAS LIKE THE HELLLLL?????????
This was beyond cute!
Hey!!! You can't just leave a cake in the woods
I made myself scarce - what a way to phrase it... my god! XD
The fact that she managed to perfectly animate Grinch Smile™ without a mouth is beyond impressive
Bro the interrupted outro
My brother ran away before
You managed to draw the grinch smile without the mouth even being there. what kind of animation GOD are you?!?!?!?!?
Btw i literally died of laughing on this one XD    6:15
Absolutely LOVED the Grinch animation for your mother XD LOL It completely made this video! *chef's kiss*
I laughed histeracly at your dad having his death glare at you  .  (R.I.P. Rebecca's dad)
"WHA'DID YOU DO?!"  why is that so relatable
Is there lore in these video?
I couldn't even go outside in my house's front yard since I was 4-12
Love this channel, Keep up the great work Becca!
THE QUEEN IS BACK
I had. A running away faze!!!
Lol I used to think I could just run away from home, hop on an airplane and travel the world.

KID LOGIC
All those pumpkins, huh, is there a Halloween video being prepared already
XD YOUR MOTHER IS GOD TEIR PERFECTION INCARNATE
The first song you were singing was from Betty boop right? Also the grinch reference I died! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
My my big fan
when i was little, i literally pulled that exact prank on my parents omg-
I tried to run away out of spite one time. Probs because my little brother was getting too much attention... My mom was like okay bye and the moment I reached the gate of my house I turned around crying. Yeah I wasn't the bravest kid
I remember when I decided to run away I tied my favorite blanket around a stick and had just enough room for my teddy bear, I made it about 5 feet before coming home
I'm a second-born too
I love your moms style.
"Kids shouldn't be walking around by themselves" have you seen Harvey girls forever have you seen what happens if that happened I'm pretty sure you would actually kind of want that also it's on Netflix if you want to watch
Both my sisters actually attempted to run away from home&to be honest,mom&dad weren't angry,just scared
"I was weird, not stupid."  This sums up a lot of kids, I feel like.
And thus; she returns
It’s been three years and I’m still waiting for her to say now I’m going to tune out
I didn't think you could make a Grinch face without a mouth. I have been proven wrong greatly
Thats so funny and good job on it
Okay, here's how I almost ran away:   When I was about 6 or 7 maybe 5, I used to take my bike out and ride around our local rec center. On one of these nights while I was biking in circles I just randomly decided to keep going forward rather then turning back around. For no reason mind you. I just felt like running away and wanted to see what would happen. I went over the bridge, past our local willow tree, and on to the sidewalk next to the street. I got to about Dixie road (look it up on google maps if you'd like) when some random women in a car stopped near me and asked me "where are you going?"   I tried to think of an excuse like "My parents walked very far ahead and I couldn't catch up," or some bull crap like that, but I think all I said was "I got lost." She ended up calling the police and they took me home to some not really angry, just curious folks asking why I would do such a thing. My big brain excuse as to how I ran away was "some gang bangers chased me! I got away from them, but got lost while trying to escape."  This was a lie as I fully knew how to get home from where I was. I just had to turn around. My parents actually believed me surprisingly and didn't punish me or anything after that. When I got home my sisters hugged me very hard and I went back to watching Thomas music videos on my tablet until I went to bed. Years later I told them the truth and they didn't really care since that was so long ago. So yeah, that's how I almost ran away from home.
Bruh
id never imagine a grinch smile without the smile, incredible
Hey you posted this on my birthday!
BUT WHAT DID SHE RUN AWAY FROM AT THE END?!?!?!!? I MUST KNOWWWW
I LOVE UR VIDEOS
I did Run Away from Home when I was in Daycare. I can remember it.

2 hours ago
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS UR FINALLY BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!
I love how you playfully said in the beginning that you wrote "I will find a job and get some money,. Don't worry about me and put up signs that say have you seen me" only for us to learn that you ACTUALLY WROTE THAT IN YOUR LETTER. x'DDDDDD
SHE DID IT SHE MADE A NEW VIDEOOOO
ahh yes of course an amazing yt has ran away
Question. How can she eat a piece of that cake those sandwiches and drink lemonade without a mouth?
But now i gotta-         Me: *scared bunny
I haven't seen you in months! You're videos are soo good now! 🔥 keep up the good work!
Finally a new video.
426 pumpkins..? HmmmmmmmMMMMMMMM? Lol
Im only thinking about the 3 months u were off
I went through a furry phase
My sister "ran away" twice. By run away I mean walked to the field behind our house and sat there for a bit before coming back.
Increíble video
Finally you made a video in three months
I CAME AS FAST AS I COULD!
I remember my own "running away" story like it was yesterday. My parents and I had a fight, so I decided "I'm leaving!" and they just let me, under the assumption I wouldn't take it seriously. I made it as far as my neighbor's house and just sat on their porch to wait for the school bus (which I thought was a normal city bus and would just take me anywhere I wanted for free. I had no grasp on the financial system of the U.S at the time). Eventually, I got bored and crawled into their bushes to take a nap. When I woke up, there was a flashlight in my face and it was 11:15 PM. Mom and Dad got freaked out when I didn't come home and thought I actually followed through with my plan and ran off. I didn't get in as much trouble as I thought I would, mostly because they both gave me permission to, but they still guilt-tripped me into never doing it again by saying how much everyone would miss me if I left.
shout out for the ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS forest background!
A video
I went through a soviet  union phase
Great story . Child hood stories are the best out of all the stories people can tell.
thats pwitty epic! UwU
I was wondering when you were going to post…
"LET'S GET UR DAD"
This was a great birthday gift
Your mom is awsome XD
As I was 5 years old, I had a Five Nights at Freddy's phase. (it's nice to see you again. Hello!)
TWO HOURS LATE---
...RUNNING [A]WAY IS EA[S]Y,   YET THIS SONG IS COPY WRITE
What took you so long I thought you were dead
4:20 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i love how dramatic your family is! i mean ya got the evil gremlin, bigger gremlin, and the pretty gargoyle.  you, your sister, your mom. then theres your dad....
So, funny story, my mom and her siblings (younger set of twins, one boy and one girl) were in that exact home alone situation when they were younger. My mom was about 12-15 and my aunt and uncle were 7-8 years old. Like Rebecca, they decided to play this same prank on my grandparents. There was a shelf-like piece of stone above the door that was strong enough to hold up heavy boxes so my mom helped my aunt and uncle climb up there and hide themselves with the boxes. She also halfway opened the back door, hid their school backpacks, and messed up their closets. When my grandma came home first, my mom was in a fake panic and hysterically told her that her and her siblings had fought and when she went to take a break in her room and came back, they were gone. My mom gave off the idea that they had either run away or been kidnapped. My poor grandma wasn't as confident in her kids courage as Rebecca's, so of course she started sobbing and panicking alongside my mom. Right as she was about to call the police, my mom felt guilty for pranking her so bad (and also scared to actually call the police) and said "MOM IM KIDDING THEYRE FINE". Mind you, I've never seen my grandma very angry, only a couple times. But my mom said that the slow turn around her shoulder and the glare my grandma gave her _terrified_ her. Long story short, my mom revealed where my aunt and uncle were hiding, they all got into huge trouble (mostly my mom since it was her idea) and even now my grandma still gets grumpy about the story, but still amused. My grandma told my grandpa what had happened, and not surprisingly, he just laughed it off. He was a pretty chill guy and was usually the one to tell the story, besides my mom. The irony of it all is that I once tried to prank my mom with a note, and when she eventually found me hiding, she was starting to get mad when my grandmother heard and was like "no seas hipócrita" (dont be a hypocrite)
A wholesome touch to a deviously silly joke. Now this is a prank done right :>
Oh yes  Finnaly something to get me out of the tragic state Omori got me into
Is... is.... is Becca doing lore?!?!?!!!!!
HEY!!   If im joining you for a picnic then i want my hands your your sweet big Chocolate cake
Rebecas back yay 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
I'm not sure why, but evertime Rebecca says "oodelally" it hits all the right nerves on brain. She should look into doing asmr videos
Ok but what are the pumpkins for!?
I one time pack my suitcase and “ran away” from home because I couldn’t have ice cream,my parents were in the front porch watching me leave
Good acting
Best prank ever
4:19 Love the Grinch Mama, Made me break a trend where I actually laughed at your videos! :D
Look like every YouTubeber taking a break and coming back
Yay a new video
....I gotta tune out?  Did the pumpkins arrive?
When your elementary school age handwriting is better than my sophomore year handwriting.
Omg it’s u I may or may not have been stalking ur page for 2 months
Why have you not posted in a while
Way to keep us watching till the very end of the video! (Thoroughly creeped btw) betcha it's just Adam or something.      Or is it?...
EARLYYYYY
Yay new video!
I was obsessed with having secrets.. BUT I END UP TELLING THEM TO EVERYBODY....
A Grinch reference in September.  Becca has made everything right in the world!
THERE IS SOMETHING IN THE BUSH OMG OMG OMG
Missed a good setup. For an airdrop of pumpkins to softly land with don’t open till October. Good job with video.
If this happends my litte girl run way i go to my hiden room that has the guns and take a gun and search
Oh and great hand writing
your writing was impressive for a 3 grader
Am I the only one who expected a jumpscare at the end?
My mom has 4 siblings, only one female sibling, but this isn't about her........   One of my mom's brothers, when he was upset, what he'd do was pack his things (usually some snacks and socks) then go across the street and climb a tree and stay there until the night. 😂😂😂
0:10 Is that a Betty Boop song??
First 2 hours club where ya at?
I managed to run away from home. I caught a train 3 hours from my town when I was like 6 or 7, the police were waiting for me at the 3 hr mark. My mum wasn’t impressed. Don’t ask how I got away with catching a train with no ticket. Small town problems
2:34 this is exactly how me and my brother got home it even took like an 1 hour for are parents to get home
Yay she's back
Nani?! Running away from home?!
I'm 13 and my space phase has never ended lol.
I love your vids 🙃🙂
Hi
The note: she's gone forever  Mom: "oh no" where's her candy
Hey Becca I love your videos can u make more please✋
I have been waiting forever a new video. YAYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!
When I was Little I planned to run away but never did👁️👄👁️
Why am I not surprised this would happen? Anyway, you're the best Becca!
wow
Warioware gamer in a nutshell 6:16
Haha Dat funny
Woooooooo
YU FINALLY UPLOADED HI HI
Your animation really has come a long way I’ve been here since the wonderland story you’re amazing Becca
I would run away with the Witch of the Woods backpack
"it's weird not to be weird".
"I will give you my address when I find it" lmao
The lack of "it's time to tune out" triggered me
🎶the sun is shining, it's a beautiful day and Becca posted 🎶 wait Becca posted ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Love the vid! Xx
I'm sure that bear will be very thankful for the lemonade and cake you left it!  The wonderfly awful idea oddly doesn't work without the grin. One of the few times where the eyes can't capture the full effect.
What was hiding in the bushes at the end? A pokemon?
didnt we all have this phace? I "ran away" inside our bike shack until mom called me to eat lol
i love that at some point she ate a peace of cake
I love your drawing
What was with the weird sudden exit and the end?
It's very interesting for me to hear that kids arent allowed outside alone! here in europe it's fairly normal to see kids starting at the age of 6-7 to go outside by themselves
The animations you make just gets better and better <3
I have a theory about the rebeca, in her world, people don't have mouth for hole of the animator, but because people talk among themselves by telepathy
Was that lore at the end???
6:23 lol
nah i wanna see what happened at the end
Paris on to to make messing with each other the sixth official love language
Grilled cheese, huh? Kinda bland, but... is that AN ENTIRE CAKE?!
I love your videos!
I love how the food was being ate
"thank u for the pic nick treats 😊"
doesnt every kid want to run off lol
I’m still on a face game that I really like five night Funkin or something like that
I’ve had a miraculous faze and Hamilton
Make a better video
Its da grins 😈
I’m still trying to think if I’m in my madness combat faze or in my fnf faze
I understand a little English but Becca speaks very fast, and my brain takes years to process and translate what I'm hearing :')
Is the becca witch coming back?
I love the references.
Are we not going to ask what was in the bushes at the end?
I’ll tell you a story about running away *I EAT THE CHILDREN THAT DO*
4:16 I NEVER thought I could identify the grinch smile without a mouth
Love your vids 😍
Thank you for coming back to U Tube
Last time I clicked this fast I wasn't even born
How did she do the Grinch face even without a mouth
Your great Becca
I’m still in my dinosaur phase
The grinch’s smile is a nice touch 💙💙
I have no idea who this is but it was related to deltarune when I searched it up, somehow..
Whare have you been Rebecca
I dint tink of duing it :|
I remember once when I was trying to go over to a friends house on my own one of my neighbors parents saw me and thought I was lost and I have never met said neighbors father so I thought he was lying and trhing to snatch me but my mother had already educated me on this so I declined, people called the police but none showed up as far as I know but to this day I still haven't met my neighbors father because we aren't clase friends anymore so I have no idea if that was their father or if someone was actually trying to snatch me off the streets
Really glad to see another mouthless video, cool!
Thanks for making us laugh Becca! ❤️
6:13 NO MOVIE SHALL SURPASS THIS LEVEL OF TENSION!!    srsly tho, great job Becca! You better be proud of this vid!
I love how in the end she was just like NOPE!!! Not dying today!
okay now we are gonna need to know some messing around stories
Finally a new vid!!!!!
I don't think Rebecca was a weird kid just because she is a YouTuber. But considering the stories she already shared about her childhood...
pog
Me and my family has a saying "if we dont pick on each other we dont love each other" so even when youre mad at someone in the family or you think they dont love you when they start to pick on ya, you know everythings alright
BRUH WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
It's my birthday today And you uploaded a video today It made my day
Man, i really love these videos. They really help me remembering lost memories from my childhood
"Apart from just hiding out in the open with a lampshade on my head"  I understood that reference
Omg I just run away yesterday but they find me
My family also has the sixth love language.
IM FINALLY NOT 5 MONTHS LATE
I tried to runaway when  I was 3 cause my parents let me play in our big yard that didn't have a fence..did the dumb Bindel thing and everything starting walking down the road when our old neighbor and his dog distracted me cause ya know cute dog..and my parents came running over about 15 min later like what are you doing?! and I was like I'm running away XD
I swear if at 8 PM we don’t get new content like the news reporter says why I oughta
👍🏻
Hi I'm a BIG FAN ☺have a good day 😊
These are the best things to listen to while sick.

Rebeccas hiding in the woods

The back and forth screaming had me cackling! It also piqued the interest of my partner and we laughed at it together

Why did I have the same idea when I was like 8?!?😂🤣
bro I wanna play this prank on my parents now
That Grinch reference was perfectly done. This was hilarious, Becca!
She the best
Hope you can do a Halloween special this year
How do you eat with no mouth?
IVE MISSED YOU! THANK YOU FOR THE UPLOAD!!!
:)
I used to say I was running away and just pack my VHS' and get to the door and my parents would stop me lol.
3rd video I have ever watch that is not many years ago.
6:20   My favorite part 😂
Tried the same thing but I’d just leave the house then go the neighbors front door and just sit there for about 10-30 minutes then go back home
nice-
Only 300?
The mother is always to blame
I ran away once, it did not end well…..
nice attention to detail with the food slowly getting eaten
It's always an amazing feeling as a kid when one of your parents helps you prank the other one.
That upload schedule kinda fire tho
WAIT!!! We were supposed to leave our phases???
The cake is missing a slice...
Yessss 😂
1 hour
But than mom got an idea... an awful idea...       Mom got a wonderful, AWFUL idea  Love the inspiration!      P.S. I do not feel sorry for your dad
Roses are red, I like crab rave, juice lawnmower blueberry toilet paper roomba, pepperoni button, asparagus laptop graveyard pan pan cake lemon cardboard yes yes yes obese microwave.
That thumbnail captured my feelings perfectly. I remember vividly packing clothes, looking around for a blanket that was checkered and a stick to hold my clothes on so that I could run away
AYE LOVE YOUR VIDS :3
BECCA HI
6:16 still has me in tears XDXDXDXD
Ah, yes the *umbrella*
Cool video! Fun fact, when my uncle was my age, he ran away to his friends house
I did almost the same thing But i put a bunch of things in a bag consisting of toys that I thought were helpful
Hi! this is the earliest time that I have gotten here 😁😆
Hiiii Becca I tried to run away ones I got bitten by ants
"Some of us had a dinosaur phrase," proceeds to flashback to first grade when I was called dinosaur girl. Why'd you have to call me out like that, Rebecca?
Mama Parham and her skull pupils X'D  I have a feeling once she becomes a grandma, you or your sister will inherit her mother skills
Early
Can I have a shout out Rebecca pls? I love your channel a lot!!!!!!!🥰
!
I threatened to run away a few times when I got mad, my mom would always play along and let me “run away” (aka walk to the end of the driveway) and then I would come back inside and calm down.
damn, i thought you died. it's been like 3 months
I have a similar story. Only difference, it was my second oldest sister and younger sister and april fools day. Second oldest was watching myself and younger sis, and they were trying to come up with a good april fools prank. And me being the naive, good middle child, I jokingly said my younger sis and I should pretend to run away. And they both thought it was brilliant. I tried to convince them no, I was kidding. But they were already throwing clothes into random suitcases and hiding them in the front door closet. So I eventually went along with it and hid with the younger sis behind our large tv stand when our parents and older sis got home. Now we didn't live in a small town or city. We lived in the middle of the woods between hunting/vacation cabins and our closest neighbors were a good 10 to 15 minutes away on our dirt road by car. So our parents literally thought me and my younger sis were lost in these woods full of wild animals and were rightfully freaked out. We let them get worked up for a few minutes before we jumped out and yelled "April fools!" The look the three of us got, we were lucky we didn't die that day. We were spanked (it was mid 90s, don't get your panties in a knot) and thusly grounded to our rooms for the rest of the week. We were solely responsible for many household chores that week, and I never voiced anymore "brilliant ideas" after
We don't stop going through fazes  I should know I'VE GONE THROUGH 7
Wheeese 😂
Wait a second...  -The phone call about 426 pumpkins being delivered -The mysterious noise that makes her run away  Is Rebecca trying to drop some serialization into her videos? I'm already hooked onto this channel like it's the blue meth from Breaking Bad, why does she feel the need to get me more addicted?  I don't know, but I love it anyways!!!
What are you running from Becca? It's just BooBoo shaking branches. Or did you exit stage right to lie in wait for the thief?
noice i missed this
can i have the rest of the cake?
YES I love your videos they make me so happy
The actual note sent me 😂
dawg where'd the stick go?
Yeah after knowing little you, she would definitely do that. Edit: Kid you was dumb. No offense.
1 hour gang
It’s been three months
Honestly child Rebecca is EXACTLY how I was as a child.
The lore of Let Me Explain Studios expands more than I thought
I got ALL OF TRHEE THE FACES ,PONYS,SPACE AND DINASAURS ,so that's an egg on your FACE
I almost forgot this channel-
Omg the animation for your mom’s evil face was 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Thank you for this masterpiece!😁😁
I realy hope she has a camp fire story video on hallowine
5:17 Did you know squirrels can carry the plague?
Love when you sing.....💕🎵🎶
2:44 this upside on the couch thing is the most relatable ever. XDXD
I had a faze like this but mine was stemmed from depression that I lied about to a therapist that gave me a radio and said listen to music you’ll be just fine. And now I can’t go a whole day without listening to music. And if I do you do not what to be around me. And before you ask no I never did run away
On time during the summer when I was probably…..7? I was tired. So I went to my favorite little nook. Now we had a couch and a loveseat perpendicular to eachother with an end table in between them. (think of an L shape). So I curled up under that table where no one could see me and almost fell asleep. About a half hour later my mom starts to look for me. Now she got super super worried and called my grandma who lived a 2 minute walk from our house to see if I went there. She started freaking out. I know all of this because I actually was awake, I just wanted to see what would happen. So about 10 minutes later i came out pretending I had been asleep and my mom was so relieved. For some reason when i felt guilty I would laugh so my mom thought that i thought the whole situation was funny. I didnt. Long story short i totally relate to this.   Once again, great video!!!!
It wouldn't have been funny if the delivery guy  had turned up with her 426 pumpkins at the end? 😂😂😂
Wow
new video YAY
030
hi
yes the queen is back!!
It was a good idea for the not so energetic in the morning Rebecca not to put all her eggs in one basket (or frying pan) by ordering those 426 pumpkins in case she was attacked by wolves or squirrels during her impromptu storytelling picnic.
1 hour late :(
Hi
Officially spooky season now geeks and peeps
Oooo, hi Becca! I’m a big fan!
FINALLY
I gotta say, for the Whole video I was mimicking that I was also having a picnic, drinking cofe and eating cake
Yay your posting again
Ahh I’m earthly????
Mamá Parham and Rachel wearing similar clothing is funny
Don't judge my stupidity, but do you actually live in the woods?
Anyone else was expecting a jump scare at the end?
E
I went through all three of those phases she mentioned at the start of the video and I feel called out because of it
Ever since I was a baby I’ve had a phase called the ocean phase where I want to learn everything about the ocean possible and I still haven’t grown out of it also I had a big fight with my dad he got so mad and I got mad I said I want to the runaway he said go-ahead I waited outside the doorstep for a while until mum came home and said what are you doing out here and she bring me inside we don’t talk about that day. Also as a kid I was very weird it’s just in my nature and I am young so does this mean I’m going to grow up to be an artist :O
I don’t remember ever seriously considering running away, the real world was frigging terrifying to me, lemme stay in this tutorial area for longer I don’t wanna pay taxes *sooner*
girl I thought I was the only one who wanted to do this 😭🤚
god ,we  missed you
the animation is diffrent
Great video
i want to run away now :)
I swear this video made me laugh so much then I have ever had in my whole day! Tysm for making my day Becca! 😁❤️
Return of the queen
ur cinjee
WHAT WAS THE NOISE?! was it the curse thing bop the note in the tree house said?
aa hey im earlyy
I used to tell myself, "Ok, if your entire family annoys you in one day, you'll run away the next." My mom, dad and both siblings all got on my nerves several days and I never did achieve my childhood promise.
Rebecca I literally just got back on YouTube and finally you posted a video or you got what you have either been on vacation for too long or you quit YouTube
Alguém brasileiro que não sabe fala inglês
nice grinch reference there
Spooky episode is next prob callin it now
Amazing video Becca!
What a mysterious outro 👀
SHES BACK
💫🌟⭐
6:17 she knew death had found her
ah I wish I came earlier xgrshfhvbhslvvv  at least I'm an hour in I love your vids keep the good work!!!
.....how did you do that and where did the stick go
Hop
And when the dad founded her in the shower
*ample jobk*
You five sec to tell me where the hell have u been
i went through a lego phase
[;
Becca leaving her tree house to do in a picnic
Eeee! She posted!
How lovely really made my day
I love when the mom made the grinch face
Dou
yes sir
The moment she said, “Let’s Get Your Dad” I laugh so hard.
When I was younger when I got mad at my mom I  would do the same lol
Hilarious! My dad and I had a very strained relationship, he was mean and frequently degraded me, but he did love me… in his own way. When I wanted to run away he offered to call a taxi to give me a further start. Needless to say he called my bluff. But then in 8th grade he wanted to actually kick me out of the house for getting a C- in Math. Yeah no bluffing, he yelled at me to pack what I didn’t want to leave behind and when my mom got home and found out what he was doing, she kicked him out. He apparently drove around for an hour cooling his head before calling back and saying he was dumb and asked if we wanted pizza. Bipolar dad of the year award for that one there. 🙄
Becca: dinosaur phase : pony phase :space phase Me greek mythology phase
Yes you can never kick the bucket without running away from home I mean I haven’t done it yet wow I haven’t lived my life yet and am 15
R.I.P her dad (if you have seen her draw my life)
wait, what happened to the 426 pumpkins??    WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PUMPKINS REBECCA??? we may be explainers but we can't explain that!!
Let’s go new video I’m stoked
I think when I was little. I would probably figure out that a glass door wasn't gonna cut it. Because when I was little, I liked learning about everything around me. And I wasn't those kinds of kids that say: If I can't see you, then you can't see me.
What
Finally next Video!
Cheese
It suck I'm sick and woke up at 2:00 pm but this came out an hour ago 😁🤣
You are are cool 😎
lore?
love how the food slowly disappears as the video progresses =]
I'm really glad you don't draw mouths, that Grinch face will never *not* be freaky
Wait people didn't go threw this faze? I thought everyone did this.
Kind of gruesome and backhanded but it comforts me that you can talk about a story about your now deceased dad with ease. Im really afraid of loosing my mom one day since I know its inevitable and im afraid of what ill do when that time comes, so thanks
Finally a new vieeo
Hello i am your biggest fan i draw just like you also your really funny also how's the tree house you should really make more videos also have fun
It’s been forever lol
I think we can all agree that Rebecca's mom definitely earned major parenting points from that
1:20 I think anybody around that age went through that phase lol. I sure did after reading My Side of the Mountain in 4th grade
Yeah you are back
Oh, I had a dino phase. It just never ended for me.
Is no one going to talk about the ending where she left in the middle of her goodbyes, then at the last seconds of the video there were sounds of something coming through the bushes or something.     If being honest I was expecting a million pumpkins to fly across the screen-  Also love the grinch reference :D
I tried to run away twice as a kid, the first time i ran away with a jump rope, and the second time i ran away on my scooter
Ouch.
As someone who did run away, do not recommend!
If it had been the 70s or 80s adults wouldn’t have bat an eye at a kid walking down the street alone because, well, 70s and 80s, latchkey kids all around.
i love the food detail at the picnic where it would slowly disappear
yess
Animation is so smooth I love it
Hello mrs witch of the woods can you make a plushy please I’ll test out you potions 🧪
OMG EARLY HI
Hi becca!
How old are you in the 3rd grade?
i am in terraria phase
She hath returned...
As a kid I wanted to run away after reading "My Side of the Mountain."  I never did.
... LET ME EXPLAIN STUDIOS LORE???
I like how they have a framed Muffin Time picture on their wall
I am so curious what what those 426 pumpkins could possibly be for
My family has the sixth form of love as well messing with one another and it’s what makes my family so great
Fact: rabecca's *yes i dont know how to spell her name* mom looks like beth from rick and morty?
"hello my geeks and peeps, my explainers and entertainers, my little oode lollies, Rebecca Parham here" probably one of the most Iconic quotes I hav ever heard.
Hii
This ended so sweat
The background's so beautiful, my eyes melted. Rebecca can you please publish your Backgrounds as wallpapers, they really make my day.
Yay !!! Finally !!! Story time!!!
Love this channel    Read More
Come to Brazil plsss, come o Brazil too
I actually ran away because I hated my family but before I even got to a stoplight some dude and his son found me and called the police. I said “I was walking my way home”. No one believed me. Eventually our Jewish neighbors found me and my mom and step dad let my little brother who they DRAGGED ALONG AND my little sister. Oh yes, I did I forget to mention. I BROUGHT MY SISTER WITH ME. But anyways they let them both get into my grandmas car and drive home and I had to walk with a very angry mom in the summer heat. They told me that I could had hurt my little sister. It appeared they didn’t care one BIT about me. So naturally I cried and told them I didn’t know why I did it and I got grounded for a day. My little sister and parents still bring it up. It makes me feel really bad but now I’ve shared with you! but yea that’s my running away story. (Sorry if I spelled things wrong, I’m typing really fast)
hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
In my little sister also watch them with me I love your videos
Becca:runs away sees a camera well hello my geeks and peeps my explainers and And entertainers   Military camera guy:we have a code Becca front left
I love your shows and I hope you make more videos in the future cuz I love them and I was scared to all of them
Poptart
I like how no one is talking about the end when Becca hears a sound and just walks away
Once I say the tile I said what is this tuck everlasting
The queen of story time!!!
Gurl ur animations r so good u make me laugh so much
My friend and her twin brother tried to run away but they weren’t allowed to cross the street on their own so they tried to run away without crossing the road. Another friend of mine tried to run away but didn’t because her cat didn’t fit in her backpack.  I always fantasized of running away because I read the Boxcar kids.
The outro for this video may be the best one I’ve ever seen!
something we all did as a small child
Honestly it's those shitty cartoon's fault if we all had that idea
**WaS** a weird kid, I think you mean **am**
How did the character eat food?
I love you video’s
I did something similar but no note, just hiding under teh blankets in my parents bed, all i could hear was my parents saying there’s a ‘strange lump’ in their bed
4:17 Ok, this is why you always needed a mouth for your character.
YESSSSSSSSSSSSS MY FAVORITE TIME OF THE MONTH (When let me explain studios posts a new video!)
I actually ran away from home once, but it wasnt as happy or charming as this one, i kinda did something i wasnt suposed to and i was sent home when my parents were out (they caught me being out in a festival when i was like mb 9 years old?) So as i was left home alone i got scared of what will happen when they come home....so my dumb child brain was like....ik...lets run away X,D. I didn't run that fare and i basically left everything valuable behind. I eventually gave up from hiding cauae ik i wasnt gonna make it so after like mb an hour i went back home and obviously got spanked.   But tbh i deserved it. I probably traumatized my mother way more then she did by leaving home unaccounted x,D
She radiated cottagecore goblincore and witchcore    I love it
She will come back when she gets hungry. Absolute savage.
Hi
I want to run but food love blankets bed phone  lot to lose
That was the fastest mins ever but each one was filled with pure entertainment
1 hours ago yay I love let me explain studios please replise
0:51 I had that phase        I still do

Noice!!! Fun fact, I haven’t grown out of my dinosaur phase, it’s what I built my channel on
0:37 Where'd the stick go?
Omg I'm kinda early
Im just realizing its 3 am now
If i trick you I get pinned   Read more
One time after an ass whooping I tried to run away and headed towards a gas station, but it was pretty far and I gave up after like 5 minutes, and my parents didn't even notice lol
I'm still in my dinosaur faze
So my phase was the "gun" phase
1:06 I was weird too
3 months worth the wait
Ahhhh fainaly missed your vidios🥲
Child Becca had better handwriting than I do at 28 years old
What a funny coincidence! Here I am,  sunbathing in my parents' backyard, watching this video. And there's Rebecca, having a picnic and telling a childhood story. It's almost like we're in the same place at the same time! Immersion +10
Becca I don’t think it was a phase for me…

I tried running away as a kid. I tried escaping through the 1st floor window. I hated getting hit with the belt as a kid. I got caught by my uncle and he told my dad and my dad hit with the belt again 🤦
Sim, eu sou o comentário Brasileiro que você procura nesse vídeo :)
Becca had the choice of YouTuber or broadway actress
This is the most funny story I have heard in while. I don't know it is because of animation or how you spoke. But I loved it and laughed through out the video.
I thought I was only a kid that which will ask you because everytime I even say that word in front of my friends are like what the heck is Lachi but now apparently I'm not
I beat up my brother til, he bleed
Long time no see.
I love your videos 😍😍

Rebecca: kids shouldn't be running around in the neighborhood by themselves  Me: running around in the neighborhood with my friends from 12 in the morning to 9 at night
4:21 GRINCH GRINCH GRINCH

Made 50 minutes ago and 2.6k comments
I have ran away too xD
We did this to my dad. We called him in the car but I was using my own phone, it like was me being lost and all that stuff lmao.
Hello I’m here 1 hour after this was posted
Ah yes, the worst thing to potentially happen to a child who ran away from home: Getting eaten by squirrels 🐿️
That scene with all the screaming was making my ears to bleed out.(I was wearing headphones)
Idk why, but when I heard the rustling at the end, I half expected Yogi Bear to pop up out of the bushes.
Her younger self's handwriting is very similar to my current one lol
Whoo hooo new vid
7:50 where’s your pumpkins
I love you!
I never knew just how much was eaten by those without mouths.
when Rebbeca Parham  uploads a video its like cristmas morning
I ran away from home once when I was like 5. Basically, I just biked to the next street over from where I lived. I guess you can say I biked away.
Yes
Cool mom Cool kid
YOUR BACK WOO
this is what i neeeded to smile thank you :>
Hi
Omg it’s been so long since you uploaded but I hope you are doing good.

I loved the grinch reference!😀
426 is my birthday :D
Hola
I know this is right before october...but the ending gave me a spook ngl
You’re my new Disney shorts
ooooooooooo my
Ligit the entire episode I kept saying, ME TOOO
when i was like 6, my mom was at work and my dad was at home, he made me mad for some reason and i packed 2 apples, 5 pairs of underwear and a toothbrush with no toothpaste, i walked down a little bit and i sat down and cried, my dad carried me back to the house after that-
“We all have phases” she says  Me : oh I’m in my frog phase
what was that last part
I like the ending,a little off putting and funny
Love the attention to detail, the grapes being eaten the apple, the cake. Thanks for all the time you put into a video
HIIII I LIKE BEING A FAN :3
Thanks for uploading another video. I love your videos 💕
i was so shocked when u just posted
how she can do grinch smile without a mouth is mind blowing 🤯
Bruh
cool
I love October's video foreshadowing
Becca: Most kids had a few phases  Me: I had a Let Me Explain Studios phase
so funny
Everyone on earth: walks normally… Everyone in LMES universe: *F L O A T*
Ayyyy
Wooooo new video! An excellent one ^_^ When I was just a little kid (maybe 3 or 4) I decided one night to hide from my family and make them think I’d disappeared. My older brother and parents were BESIDE themselves, until a little while later my mum heard the full basket of washing let out a giggle 😂
MAN i wish their merch could leave usa....
My brothers and I tried the running away thing as well...though it was more like we hid from our mom and left no note. When she came back, she looked everywhere for us and checked with the neighbors, who hadn't seen us. I'm not sure how long she searched, but it was long enough to completely wreck her. She eventually just sat on the couch and cried.   And then us being the insensitive jerks we were finally burst out of the hallway closet yelling "Surprise!" Yeah...she didn't take too kindly to our prank and I'm sure we were grounded for it, lol.
“Long ago, the 4 family members lived together in harmony, but then, everything changed when young Rebecca’s brain attacked. Only the mother, the only one who wouldn’t believe a note could stop her. But when the world needed her most, she teamed up with her daughter. An hour (or smth) passed and the father came home, to a shocking discovery. And although his detective skills are great, he has to go the the toilet before he find his daughter. But I believe, her father can save this family”
Hi

Everyone in the comments: wow this was so funny :D  Me:what happend at the end, what was in the bushes, why did Rebecca run away into the bushes looking scared, I need answers o-o

Brilliant hiding place X'D I laughed so much at that part.
Wow I had many runaway phases. Pretty much about 10 to 15 times
:0?
how did bacce know what i was thinking
Yo
Baragon (バラゴン Baragon) is a subterranean reptile kaiju who first appeared in the 1965 Toho film Frankenstein vs. Baragon, and later debuted in the Godzilla series in the 1968 film Destroy All Monsters.  The original Baragon from Frankenstein vs. Baragon was a villainous creature that came to the surface to feed on livestock and people. As the creature only surfaced at night, most people blamed Frankenstein for the beast's attacks. When Baragon threatened Frankenstein's caretaker Sueko Togami, Frankenstein challenged him to battle, and successfully defeated him only to fall into a fissure caused by Baragon's burrowing. The second generation Baragon in Destroy All Monsters was living on the human-monitored Monsterland facility at the end of the 20th century, and disappeared after the Kilaaks invaded the island and took control of the monsters. Baragon later appeared at Mount Fuji and witnessed the battle between the Earth monsters and King Ghidorah after the aliens' mind control was severed. Baragon's next film appearance came in the Millennium series film Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, where he was the first of the three Guardian Monsters to battle Godzilla. While not as popular as monsters like Mothra or King Ghidorah, Baragon has maintained a strong fan following over the years.

4:16 Becca making a grinch reference in September 😭😭
P O G G E R S
Hello people im here early!-   (56 minutes)
Hi
YAY another video I love your videos there is so much effort and good quality animation inside of them! They also have funny true stories
6:24-6:30 What are you going to do with those pumpkins, Becca?
Rebecca run it’s the village people. They are looking for the witch!
I still have that dinosaur faze For a second at the end I thought yogi bear was gonna pop out of the bushes
BREAKING NEWS AN ADULT ARTIST WAS WEIRD AS A KID!!!
The "Bye!" with the heart exclamation point killed me. 😂
Nice video Becca
Spooks was not the one in the bushes scavenging for the Skittles shrubbery that Spooks heard of on the interwebz >.>
YEAH BECCA I WONDER HOW TREE HOUSE IS GOING???
hii
I often wonder how Becca or other major youtubers feel uploading a video and then getting almost 100k views in under an hour.
Wait a minute, Becca! You've planned a picnic? For a minute there, I thought you were running away in a classic fashion!
Im 58 mins late early BUT YAY NEW VIDEO
So did I just buy that backpack the moment I saw it? Yes. Yes I did
When I was a small kid until my mid teens I had always considered running away
Huh, her 3rd grade handwriting is better than my handwriting as of right now.
*B a g*
I’m in my Pokémon fase
BECCA WE MISSED YOU AND ARE GKAD YOURE BACK AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
SHE'S BACK YAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
The bit at the end is making me think Becca is making lore for her videos
I'm in my Ancient Greece phase
This video was super cute and just made me smile, but then right at the end after she talked about how her dad got his revenge on her and she loved it, I remembered that he had died and suddenly this video became bitter sweet...
Hi! I’m new
I LOVE THE GRINCH REFERENCE
That Grinch look….😖Beuugh😖….
Holy Jesus this is funny
I love these videos!
7:28 okay that's really sweet
I love the fact that the picnic food gets eaten progressively throughout the video
...And your hand writing as a kid it's better than mine as an adult... I suddenly feel like I should only type everything, all the time...
Anyone else find the lemonade pitcher ... odd? Or notice that the sandwiches got eaten ... leaving crumbs on the plate? *very cool details*
you ran away from home WOW
You were ordering pumpkins to prepare for Halloween weren't you
Ooh 56 mins ago
6:16 *ONE WINGED ANGEL INTENSIFIES*
You´re not the only one who has a family that express his love with pranks. An example of this is that I put the Imperial March every time my dad with asthma inhales (he sounds like Darth Vader).
The fact that your mom was in on it.
And she finally made a video
Hello
Hawe are you fine  .....wait your fine ......you talk do maths that means your fine.......
Not me sitting and waiting in the end on the "i gotta tune out" XD
*LET'S GET YOUR DAD!*  I LOLed
Je je this was so cute ❤️
Cool
Let’s be honest, we’ve all tried to run away at least once DONT LIE!!
I feel like almost all kids have gone to "run away" and then came back 10 seconds later XD edit: Congrats on #2 on trending!! You deserve it! 🥰🥰🥰
me locking myself in the bathroom when my auntie comes over
Yay new video 😀
This scenery is beautiful
This reminds me of a few pranks me and my family did to my dad.
7:44 *speed sliding intensifies*
that grilled cheese looked good
My phase was gaming. as a 4 year old when i got to play on my brothers PS1
I'm just writing my comment here before it's my first time watching this classic
Becca is the best YouTuber
Yeah
'kay
you know i thought of doing the same thing💭
May Becca’s dad Rest In Peace He will always be remembered from this video ♥️
The rare time when mom is the more chilled parent than dad
im a boy and i went through a pony phase
4:19 nice grinch reference there
I thought there was gonna be a jumpscare at the end ngl
yaaas im early
how did you take a bite out of that sandwich if you don't have a mouth. also the Grinch face looks terrifying without a mouth
Becca is the most fabulous straight of all time. I aspire to her level.
436 pumpkins, WHY do you need that many.
Ahh! This was so great 😂
Cool :D
Oh god, I laughted so hard. I loved the animation and the story was simply amazing, this is a great video Rebecca <3  PD:Greetings from Colombia
The oldest is half most responsible, half just secretly insane and or tired and sad, remember to keep that in mind for any future pranks
I’m a expert at hiding (young me)
Now she can live in the woods and be in the crazy lady there
I really like the news part that fits with Becca alot
Me: "Mind if I join you?"   Becca: "Sure."
I'm impressed. If I ran away from home my parents would find me and I would be grounded. So I'm not going to do any pranks of me faking running away from home. I know better.
Why the hell do you need 426 pumkins?
Me when Becca has a new vid :👁👄👁
You know it's going be a good day when their is a new video
It’s been forever since u called us Our geeks and peeps; my explainers and entertainers; my little oodle-lollies I MISSED U 😭
Becca, is that your Halloween episode trying to escape early?
Early
Miss Param you made a noise that triggered my hyperacusis. If you don’t know what it is just Google what hyperacusis is.
Person: Yeah I don't think star wars is great at all, it's pretty garbage  Me: 6:18
aff essa bosta em ingles q saco meo
"I was weird, not stupid" I somehow am weird AND stupid
EARLY
7:41 What? Where did Becca go? WHAT DID YOU DO?! DID YOU SAY SOMETHING TO HER?!!!
I feel bad for Becca because this is one of the times she'd get to hand out with her dad before he passed rip papa Parham and I hope Beccas doing alright
I am offfended by the writing skills young Rebecca has. I write like a russian doctor.
0:37 How did the lemonade not spill and the cake not squished
Yes a new vid
Awesome
And why 3 months no YouTube
Becca... how'd you eat that sandwich
Hi I am A BIG FAN OF YOUR ART YOU ARE SO 😎 COOL 😎 LOVE YOUR STUFF
hi send a hug to Brazil we are very much your fan :)
omg the seen with her dad standing on a rock is amazing!! XD
*Bro... how she take a bite of the grilled cheese, If she doesn't have a mouth...*
Everyone Else: Aw what a heartwarming story!   Me: She has no mouth to eat that food.....                         In actuality though wonderful work!
yall left your space phase?
this was so funny
Foreshadowing
Nice video
MORE IMPORTANT THAN MY HOMEWORK
Hey listen if anyone ever wants to....RUN AWAY I can totally help with that. I mean some would call it "making someone disappear" but hey tomayto tomahto.
I can't wait to see all the "when the world needed her most" jokes
Okay can I just say the youngest siblings don't always listen to the eldest sibling. Meaning most times they say to do stuff or whatever the sibling says   I know this from experience  Being the oldest  I would just lock the doors and try to occupy them
i love your vids!
I love how the food gets less and less with every cut to her in the woods
Omg I didn't get a nofication and am early ejedhhdsj
Becca’ your editing skills are getting better and better! Teach us!

Ah yes I had that kind fase too . I think it was because of the amount of running away from home  kinda movie's I watched!
I feel betrayed she didn’t even finish her line she just left Probably I go deal with those pies 🤔
Hey, I ran away too! LITERALY! just not for fun
My sister Walked In on me watching this And she said that she actually did something like this but she actually left the house and went to our backyard
*Me:* why would she do something like that?   *Becca:* one day I was bored  *Me:* ah right that makes sense....after all why does anyone ever do anything? Say it with me.  SHEER. ABSOLUTE. BORDEOM!
get your "here in under a hour" ticket here!
when i was in 2nd grade, i went through a dragon phase. why? two words: *DRAGON CITY*

omg hi
My version of "running away" when I was little, and I am using this term loosely was leaving the house without telling my parents cause I was mad at them for some reason, and walking to the corner of my block to hide behind a big tree... and then having no idea what to do next lol.
OMG MISSED YOU
I sense a Halloween background🎃
Grrrrrrrrrrr
That spiraled notebook is lit, reminds me of SCP
haha that was so funny your like me when I was a kid
Rebecca talking about pumpkins and a suspicious noise in the background? Hm…. Could it be to a new video in the future? Maybe, a spooky scary video
I got aaaa   Animator phase about a year A fnaf phase (couple months) Sonic phase 2 years??? Meme phase (2 years) Fnaf phase part 2 (unknown i still have it lol) And I forgot the rest of my phases  Edit and a dantdm mod review phase was about 3 years

Alright bois. It's time to share what your phases as a kid were. I was obsessed with garbage trucks, fire trucks, and Monster Jam when it was in its prime as a kid.
I used to watch you all the time but when I lost your channel I was kinda sad but now I found it and it’s the best
Hi Rebecca

I was a dinosaur kid
Donno why, but I expect Elmer Fudd at the end. "Be vewy vewy quiet... It's Becca hunting season!"
Rare moment: being early without subscribing
69k views Nice
When I was a kid I was exactly like adult Rebecca Evil weird dreamed of living in the woods and other things
The grinch part has got to be one of the most clever things I’ve ever seen.
One time I ran away and got picked up by a stranger with a dog... thankfully he was kind and drove me home. Could have gone way worse haha.  Great video Becca! :D
I got 2 of the references animated into this video.
Hi Rebecca
Rebecca how tf u gonna make all that food and not be able to eat it.
Another video yay!
I want the bag and notebook but I am poor
This was so worth the wait! It got me laughing and giggling so much!
Hiiiiiiiiiii
Not gonna lie if my (future) SO did this to me I’d be mad for days. I didn’t find this prank funny at ALL.
The part I like of the video, is how the title of the video and her profile name lol like: “Running away from home” and then at the bottom: “Let me explain”
Jesus approved
me seeing the immediate death in rebecca's mom eyes:I would not look at her young becca ( 2:09)
becca, you are BACK
greetings Becca. It's been a while.
yes a video, I've waited for months if only animations could get weekly uploads.
Yaaass!!! She has returned!!! 🥳
Lol
Yhhh
Hi I’m really sick and I LOVE your vids can you please pin me 🤢😮‍💨🥰
This video came out just when I asked my mom if I ever planned to run away as a kid
Next video. Father-Daughter prank stories.
Rebecca: older suppose to know better Me: I’m the oldest and Idk what 9 + 10 is
This isn’t replayed to the video topic but the backgrounds for you videos are so pretty :O
Here before an hour! :D
I tried ranning away so many times  But my mom would tell me that the Mac and cheese was really with Persuaded me to stay for that day   (Repeat for 12 years)
YESSSS
Yesss another vid
When he opened the shower door I thought he was going to spank her or something lmao u avoided a bullet
It’s nice to still see this channel existing
With the shower thing, I had a similar experience, but at my grandmother's house. My grandma couldn't find me, until she found me in the shower, it was exactly like the kind of shower you hid in! I was a baby at the time, so I don't remember a thing about that, but every time my grandmother told me that story, I would laugh. Hope you enjoyed reading this short and sweet story (if you read it that is...)!
i-i-i-i-i-ve always wanted to do this but..i need my mama's protection              /j obv
Back when i was a kid i was obsessed with those gun toys and even now I’m still obsessed with guns  From gun toys To Actual guns  And I have some decent aim  Sorry for telling this random info that no one asked for
I've definitely have, and kinda still do, have a dream to go out into the world on my own. I loved "runaway stories" as a kid like The Secret Life of Bees or Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, but I knew I could never leave because I loved my mom so much. Now that I'm old enough to take care of myself and live on my own, my dream has been rewritten into something more realistic, like getting an RV and maybe a cross-country trip, or just getting a house in the farmlands of where I live. But, right now, I'm not quite ready mentally or financially for something like that.
Your back
I love how the picnic plates get progressively emptier and emptier
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE ENDING I AM SCARED
You really were a bit weird but you also were funny and cute! (Greetings from Greece)
Becca some of us had a dinosaur phase a pony phase and a space phase Me *had a godzilla phase as a kid* And i still do godzillas cool
Wooo
oh there you are
'and now...'  HALLOWEEN EPISODE, YEAH!!! XD
Before she was the Witch of the Woods she was the Witch of the Bathroom ah how goals change from childhood
Ever since I’ve been little I’ve been addicted to guns
I actually tried to run away from home when i was 12 because my home life then and now is pretty shit. It didnt workout tho
Funny
:0
I'm nearly early :D
Finally I have waited so long. Totally worth the wait 😇
I must know the revenge story to this
Lol i love this
can we all appreciate how beccas mother is definitely cooler than sll of our mothers?
Oddly enough I ran home instead of running away. Mainly because all my stuff was there and I was in the countryside so it would take at least a 5-mile walk into town. I forgot what my parents went to school for but they left me on the playground and thought "eh he'll be fine" and for the most part, I was. Until dark and I was starting to get nervous that my parents weren't going to pick me up. So I looked for the car where we parked and It's gone. My childhood trauma of being left alone set in and I started walking home (I knew the general route to my house). About give or take 2 miles in a truck pulls up, I get in because I recognized them as my neighbors and I told them my address and they drove me in the opposite direction. The heat of the moment made me think "wtf is going to happen." But my neighbors actually drove back to the school where my parents were worried and my dad apparently moved the car. I ripped my dad up and down after that.   What made it worse is that several classmates kept messing with me about that for a few weeks or so. Man 3rd grade happens to be the time when some of the most embarrassing stuff comes out. Including fighting a dam hose
I love how she did the grinch huge smile thing with her mom even though the characters don't have mouths
Btw i think the animation is getting better and better.
Actually I thought  Wow.   I haven't watch you in a while
The food was nice along with the story
Omg you can't leave me hanging like that!  What was making the noise at the end of the video!?!    Curse you animator Becca! *shakes fist*🤣
Come here to collect you’re here before 1 hour ticket
Oo!
Cool
I'm l a t e
The legend is back!
I like running
I thought about running away a bunch as a kid. Never actually tried it since I didn't know what I'd do after I left, but it was a thing.  Also yes, I'm pretty sure annoyance is a love language. I think the only reason me and four of my other sisters are as close as we are today is because we'd bother each other so much when we were children. It's just that "Annoyance" doesn't sound as lovely as the other love languages, so it never gets counted.
Yay she’s BACK THE QUEENS BACK!
Rebecca every time I hear story about your family you make me appreciate mine even more thank you
Get your here within an hour reward here
"we all had periods of time where we were peculiarly fixated on a subject or idea when we were kids"  autistics, ppl with ADHD and other neurodivergents, running around hhyperfixating on stuff for the whole duration of their life: right...
Please make a Halloween video please 👻
Uh uh sure
Kids, Am I right
EARLY 36 MINUTES AGO
Finally a post!
Becca: now I gotta tune o- "runs away " Me coming out of the bushes: WAIT BECCA YOU DIDN'T EVEN OFFER ME TEA! WHY ARE YOU RUNNING AWAY!?
Yes why do you have that
This what you wanted to do when your done with life 😂🖐️
Fine! More tea, cake and lemonade for me then! 🤪 But yeah I did a similar thing to my Mom except it was a game of hide-and-seek and after I came out of my hiding spot let's just say I got in major trouble afterwards. 😬😅 Love your videos.
I got the notification for this right as I was recovering from doing something that makes me anxious (going to the grocery store, idk why that makes me anxious) Thanks Becka!  /not joking
YAY! I love u Becca!
At this point the news could actually report that an animator as a kid was wierd
Yay new video
BOO ninja skills
Meep
Nice Prank on your dad and mum. Is that yours. ♥️💜💙.  Were are you in the outro???????
YES! THANK YOU! I NEVER KNEW WHAT THAT BAG STICK THING WAS CALLED!

SHE HAS AWOKEN!
i love  your vids
Hi
Oooo I’m early
:0
I love you animation. I hope one day I can animate so good like you.
Let be honest most of us tried this as a kid for one reason or another lol
:D
The note: "I'm running away" Becca's mother: "Oh no!                                           Anyway"    Edit: ty for all the likes! :D
*Me looking for a new video* *Sees it say posted 35 minutes ago* YAY
Rebecca is the best
2334th
hehe
Welcome back Madam, we're hope you're doing well, and it's nice to see another great video
*The green person in the video probably had the same experience hence why they're so salty.*
I ran away when I was in first grade and went to the library, because my mom did f pick me up and I was trying to get home by myself. I made it to the library when my uncle Larry and cousin Eric just so happened to be in the library that day, and took me to their house- so they called my mother who may or may not have called the police (because I was 6.5 years old) to come look for me. I got chewed out that night.
wait is she making a lore just watch the end
7:38 look at the bush at the top left 😲
Look at Rebecca,the sadistic and DARK witch of the woods
When i was 4 i run away and my mom though i was just gonna go to my tree house and she said no kiss for for mommy before you go and i did i landed to a next state i was found two days later by the police
THE GODDESS HAS RETURNED
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat was that ending, Rebecca? You launching an ARG or something?
A new video
Even without a drawn mouth, I could still see the creepy grinch smile on Rebecca's Mom's face
OMG HI REBBECA
Hehehe wow I didn't expect you mom to be awesome  and goin in on the prank.  An I miss seeing your vis, love you and stay safe.
You should make your own cinematic universe
Great video, but now I'm hungry for a picnic
Even though I am still a kid, I am so surprised by this child`s behavior.  (Maybe not that I can understand.) ._.
Let’s go upload from animator
I love how Rebecca started doing a fairytale Setting 😍
Why does your dad look like Jerry from Rick and Morty
yo totally unrelated but i saw someone at disneyland yesterday who was such a doppelgänger of you but she had black hair
Loves the story was vary entertaining
are we just not going to talk about that ending ...
Well this is a nice surprise
Wow it was only posted like only 30 minutes ago and 2.2k views
Hi
FINALLY
well I did try to do it one time in my childhood to...but I decided to just hide in the woods...and not in the bathroom and did not do it as a joke...I just wanted some alone time from my family just for one day.
My running away story was when I was in probably like the 4th grade. I saw a video about kids who lived with wolves. I really wanted to do that, so I planned for like a month about how I would do that, I also remember thinking I should bring a toaster like bruh. My friend didn't wanna come along so I decided I would go alone. I told everyone I was a shapeshifter and I would run away to live with wolves. During recess I ran to the gate and climbed over it and ran down the neighborhood. I am the opposite of someone who likes breaking the rules, so I basically had a heart attack and ran back. I got in trouble with the principal but my parents didn't really care because all little kids do stupid things and you gotta learn from them. I was super embarrassed about this story for a long while lol...
3:59 wow she really pull the uno reverse card out of her pocket
4:10 My GODS! this is scene has to be one of the best of your channel i almost choke with my coffee.
The return of the king… i mean… queen #beccaisback

Speed run any%  Destination *anywhere but home*
Yay new vid
hi I’m funny what’s your name funny? Hahah..ha…hah…
alright can we just talk about how pretty the match is-
Ayyyyyye!
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. 🎈
I’m glad I’m not early bc that would make me feel like I have pressure on me to say something funny in the comments when it reality I’m not even funny-    Does this make sense
...i could go for grilled cheese right now...
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
YAY NEW VIDEO
It takes so long befor there is another episode
Is it weird that I don't consider you or your childhood weird?
Ooooooooo a new vid
How did that picnic blanket come out perfectly with everything being perfectly placed on it?? I’m assuming the laws of physics don’t apply to the tune for old though.
6:17-it was at this moment that young becca knew,she screwed up.
I love this video 😍📸
I got a food phase i think. i kept a few blueberries in a tissue And hid it until i was hungry and lazy to go down stairs
You should make a Story of the Most rememberable times you and your family Messed with it each, I'll definitely stay tooned for that Story

7:39 OH HELL NAH!!! Rebecca has something preperded for Halloween and l am scared s#*tless!
Where you going dear gonna be a.     Loney witch
My mom told me a funny story once. When she was about 7, her friend wanted to run away. She walked up to the door with her things and yelled, "I'm running away!" The very second she opened the door, thunder crashed, and lightning flashed. The friend shut the door and said, "Tomorrow. First thing, tomorrow."
Hi Rebecca I hope you know we all love you and we love when you post!
I was a weird kid growing up and still am today (35 years old) and I love your mum (I'm British) best mum ever. Also I suggest you do witch of the woods costume for Halloween. Your family is awesome.
You look a lot like my evil aunty
E
Didn't watch this yet, But I know this is going to be either funny, or sad
6:16 made me laugh so hard
hi
Moms most perfect plan grinch face. Kids most wanted
Finally
I ran away but then my mom told me my favorite show was on so I just went back
Imagine your house being the size of your bathroom  *couldn’t be me*
Kool
Why, might I ask, do you need 426 pumpkins
I have a suspicion that the ending may be setting something up for a Halloween video.
Wew
I’ll always be in a dinosaur phase… it’s my life
moments before death 6:14
I was weird to
One time I ran away from home and when I came back no one had noticed or wondered where I was 😃

Every time when she tells her childhood stories they are amazing
I like how she was able to convey the Grinch's expression without the use of a mouth. Very cool.
AHHH THE QUEEN HAS UPLOADED
Me and my family can not go one day without making my dad be like:" Why are we still here,? Just to suffer😓" We roast him everyday.😂😂😂
Hm. Seems our dearly beloved parents were the same! I could be drooling, foaming, frothing at the mouth next to the sidewalk of my elementary school...but if I didn't get inside that car my mother would simply drive off. Aren't parents the best? :3
Doesn’t these videos just make your day?
wTFFF I WAS ABOUT TO SLEEPPPP HAHA
Missed a solid opportunity to go "Hello my geeks and peeps, my explainers and entertainers, my little oodle lollies. I didn't see you there!", acting surprised.
bruj i know this one is gonna be a banger
She’s back 😁😁😁
That was an... omnious? Ending? WHY?
Uwu your BACK
What do you think Rebecca's parents think when they watch these kind of videos?
Rebbeca I have art block!!! ):  By the way I missed u we all did.
Okay good video, but the entire time I was just confused on how your character ate food without a mouth...
Ok but how is she eating on the picnic
Is missed you so much😁
I said that I would run away from the house when I was 7 and come back when I’m 8 now I’m way older than 7 now I’m laughing at what I said like bruh LOL
I love your channel you're so funny
*Reads the title* Me: time to write a creepypasta!
I just realize this video was recent lol
Epic
0:52 I had a space phase... But it never ends.

Hahaha some kids threaten to run away but I got threatened to be kicked out!  Talk about being ahead of the curve! 😄😅😢
*love yourself  before you start to love someone else  <3*
I was at a friend’s house and decided to “run away” and we hid in our van.
At the end I was like “King Julien gay the 9 we’re going into WAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!
Great Video!
good news and bad news, i told my sister you were the witch in the woods and she spreaded it around that you are and now some 2nd graders think you live in the woods and that your channel is cursed and that your actually a witch... oops XD
Yes I missed you!
Ah preparing for Halloween I see, how noble, where are the ghosts at, where is bigfoot...? DID YOU NOT GET EVERYTHING PREPARED?!
AndAnd why have you not been posting what is three months
(Backstory: my friend lived next door) One time my mom grounded me from playing on the computer, so I took my giant stuffed bear and tried to go live with my neighbors thinking that no one would notice. (I was 8)
6:45 "you all are bunch of jerks" best reaction ever lol  4:44 IT'S MUFFIN TIME
Img your back on YouTube!!!
7:18-7:22, Don't most families have that? Mines do.
:]]]
GUYS SHE'S STILL POSTINGGG
YOU HAVE DONE IT AGAIN! 😄
Yay even more of young evil Becca!
AA UR MY FAVOURITE ANIMATOR
I love ur videos  😍😁🐱
4:17 Literally the Grinch. And I recognized this without the grin. No mouth, no problem, as usual. XD This is perfect!
now I'm sad her handwriting as a small child is much better than mine as an adult
Okay I did something similar to what she did when I was 6. We were in the south of France (nearly at the spanish border) where my paternal grandmother lived and my mom took us to the beach. The city we were in is very touristic and the pier above the beach had a lot of restaurants and shops and a lot of peoples walking around, so my mom worried of what would happen if me and my sister got lost told us that in case we couldn’t find her to wait for her under a pole with a huge clock on it that was visible from everywhere on the pier/beach. She makes sure we have sunscreen and flotters on because the beach was on the Atlantic side and current was no joke. Then she set up our spot and when she turned back we were gone. She looked for us for an hour before checking pur meeting spot and there we were me and my four year old baby sister. When she asked what happened I told her I wanted to see if the meeting spot worked so apparently while she was busy I took my sister with me and made her wait with me for an hour just to see if our mom would actually show up! Every summer after that we were enrolled at the mickey club so it was definitely a win for me :)
I love your videos
Everyone did that as a child
Based on the reaction your mom had, I can definitely understand why you were weird.
Finally
Im in a Friday night funkin phase
Rebecca don't get mad but I told my music teacher about you.
Ahhh! The most important items for any missing persons search, oven mitts! 😂
6:17 I CANT XD
Yes! You're back!  I remember running away once, because my dad gave me a fake roach.  But I only made it to the end of the driveway, cause I wasn't allowed out in the street without my sister. XD
hi bois
I love your vids and been watching your videos for a long time.
Hi
Ahhhh  This uploading of this video just made me so happy. I’d just got home from a walk in the nearby park and had gotten caught in the rain and so was feeling really miserable. I opened YouTube and this made my day! Thankyou Rebecca

When i was 5-7 i was about to run away every other day when i got upset and sometimes more than once a day..... and i only ever brought my bike with be BUT i only ever got to the gate before turning back thinking  "i will give them another chance".
What do you need 426 pumpkins for?
Anyone else think Becca's picnic setup looks really cozy and nice
i waited until everyone went to their rooms then ran to the backyard got cold and went to bed xD
BABE WAKE UP REBECCA UPLOADED A NEW VID--
i once escaped from home for about 2 hours after that my parents found me
I actually asked my parents what I should take with me, when I planned to run away 😅 Needless to say, I was busted.
2:08 R.I.P 😵💀☠ 3:36 Mama Parham:🧐🥸....📔📕📖📘📗📙📚📓📒📃📜📄📰🗞📑...😤😠😡🤬 4:10 no don't reference the Grinch we all know that story 4:49 omigod really lololololololololololololololol 7:06 nope it looks exactly the same 7:37 ...but now-

I’m glad to see you to post videos again
Early?
Do I sense a subtle clue at 6:24 for a Halloween special coming up by the godess Rebecca Parham?...
I am in 2 farces Wallace and gromit and Jurassic park
But i didn't ask + ratio 😭🙏
6:01 I know you were just a kid, but I couldn't help but face palm myself.
I wanted to run away from home as a kid. I only made it to the stop sign and cried back home.
Hi
What are you going to do with 426 pumpkins?
I ran away from home once, but I didn't come back.
The queen has returned.
It’s always a good day when you upload
Wow thats knda sad
We have similar handwriting
I wonder if that ending scene in the video will become a series where she adds a little side story while telling the story of the video
My favorite part when she used the grinch mention
2:51 *HOLD UP* how did you eat that without a mouth?!?!?!?!
NOICE SINGING
A
anyone else notice the weird stuff going on? I think there is more to this narraitive
IM EARLY
Your mom 🤣🤣🤣
To let me explain studios You forgot the but now I must tune out
Who wouldn’t try and run away.
Yea I grew out of my dinosaur phase.. Yea.. totally  I don’t spend hundreds of dollars on dinosaur stuff… No..
Hey Rebecca! I most recently discovered your channel, and I just want to say that I love your videos! Keep up the great work! P.S. PHANTOM OF THE OPERA IS AWESOME!!!
I love the folklore vibes of this video
I’m finally early
Its been a while since I laughed at a YouTube video, so we'll done Rebecca. Also, I recently ran away from my house for like 20 mins bc I was TERRIFIED after I pranked my older brother (I had to return home bc I had a lizard to feed)
The sappy ending was just so perfectly executed!! Duude who else can tell stories like Becca, this is amazing!
wow, also rip your father XD
IM HERE EARLY!
Oh, I loved the Grinch reference.
YES ANOTHER VIDEO 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
Becca, why do you need those pumpkins?
Yeah I remember my time running away from home too and hide in the house !  But when my dad found me all I remeber was he having a chop off tree and bottle of hand sanitiser I I don’t remember the rest of the it’s kinda foggy🤨
Just gotta say, the bit where your mom did the grinch smile without a mouth was done amazingly. Awesome job with that!
Your animations are _SO_  bery and nice (◍•ᴗ•◍)❤
Rebecca is making plot for us to follow soon
You last posted three months ago
I think something else wanted to join her picnic…..
Yay she upload THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER
This is like the best one
hi
We all thought of doing this before for the stupidest reasons
Damn
Rebecca’s dad  really blamed her mom for her running away 🤣 4:34
Hi
I burst out laughing when she did that Grinch Reference
I tried running away once. It didn’t end well
Yay she is back :D
I ran away from home as a kid. My adventure to the end of the driveway was quite extravagant
We all LOVE when Rebecca tells stories right?
AAAAA YES A BEW VIDEO
Can we talk about her backgrounds because those are amazing.
That was weird but I kind a like it and the next videos you’re explaining about you go trick or treat on Halloween Thanksgiving and Christmas so I’ll see you at the next videos
Yes yes yes
"Now, I know exactly what you're thinking"  That I want to watch Gildedguy now?
you didn't
I though”it’s too soon for this video”but I realized that the last video was 3 months ago
Yes
Instead of “weird“ I prefer the term eccentric
I really love how she makes these videos. Next time PLEASE!!! Do a toturial or something how you make videos pls pwitty pweese🙏
Ive went through a "i wanna run away from home!" phase, im still going thru it lmao.
This literally got me a flashback to when I was home alone and got a call from my older brother (9 years older, and he was obviously over the age of 18-20 at this point) and he told me to leave a note for my parents to say that child protective services came and took me away, and if I did this, he would give me sweets. Obviously, I hid under the stairs for 15 minutes until they came home.  They thought it was a joke and calling me out and trying to bait me with a milkshake they brought back home with them for a treat. 5 minutes they're asking each other what rooms they've checked, what's happened, where could I have gone, was I really gone?, etc.   I came out from under the stairs and they weren't happy. To this day I ask my brother why he wanted me to do this, and he always shrugs and says "I dunno, probably thought it would be funny".  I never got those sweets from him.
The outro!!!
MILADY IS BAAAAAAAACK!!!!!!
What hapoened at the end i was scared and now im curious
That’s weeiiirrd, I just last night randomly rewatched a few of your videos wondering when you were going to upload again o_0
yay
I'm weirder than you
I was wondirng where you have been
I have actually done this.I was I think six and I told her that I would leave the house for some unknown and stupid reason that was really important for me probably back then.And she said:ok.And I got out.I got back inside obviously.
Wow! You had pretty good hand writing as a kid.
I swear every time you tell a story involving your mom, I just love her more and more. She sounds like a fantastic parent.
Omg finally
Kinda concerned i was just watching a girl runaway-
I was obsessed with birds as a kid  Practically memorized the bird species of North America  6:17 my anxiety waking me at 4 am
Kids run away when mom wint let them eat ice cream for dinner >:(
I can still see the terrible smile without that mouth
It was amazing Rebecca I'm happy you're back
picnic time
You know it's a good week when infamous swoosh and Let me explain studios post on the same weekend
Lol
you ruined the joke beca why why seriously why you should've hid under the bed i need  a time machine        Ps : I love you         I love you         I love you         I love you
Spider-Man 4: Running away from home
These backgrounds are so nice
Becca, why would we think you're running away in the intro? You're an adult who lives on her own. You've already ran away (legally).
I have been waiting for you to post 😭
can we just appreciate that the food actually got eaten
14 minutes ago this was posted how does it have this many comments
3 months and now you’re back yey
I've waited months!
5:35-5:40. “We much find our child.… right after I pee”. I don’t know why that’s so funny to me, it just is😂
Im early!
Finnaly she hasn’t posted for 3 months our queen is back
Why didn’t i get a notification for this? 😢
Hey Becca! Watching you has inspired me to draw and started animation! It’s just with Gacha club (a popular character creation app) and my mum is going to find me art lessons and a college for when I’m older! I really think it’s my passion and you helped me find it
👍, If the note is 25 years old that makes you for six when you wrote the note that means you’re pushing 30
the legend is back folks!
BACK WITH THE HEAT
I had something similar as a kid. My grandma's house was in part of a train station after buying it off and every week or so a train would pass by, and i was *charmed* with the idea of hopping on a moving train and living the life on the run, hopping trains until the end of my days, sadly my mom knew this and always kept an eye on me so i wouldn't try to run after one and get squished.
Wow
At first: I'm running away! *Realizes that I'm broke and have no place to stay or sleep.* Alright I'm back.
I would be interested in getting the Merch, if I had the money
One time me and my bro tried to run away. We didn't last 30 minutes xD
You know you just can't live without a youtuber anymore when this so said youtuber post a new video and you immediatly stop everything you were doing to watch it.  Another amazing video from our favorite witch in the woods. Thank you so much !
One time when i was like 5 or 6, I also thought of running away. I got out a laundry basket, a pillow, and a blanket, and I proudly told my mom “I’m running away! I’ll live on the corner and you’ll find me there!”   Thus my mom found out what stupidity she had inflicted upon me when she dropped me on my head. (Just kidding! Mom, love ya!)
QUEEN IS BACK
Our queen hath returned!!
I also made an attempt at running away as a kid.
Wow, your poor dad.
Becca you have lots to explain  and im not talking about your childhood
I thought of doing that, but i was to sceard of my parents lol
How  cute are you trying to run away when you are a kid Me who actually run away from his house for 3 days when he was a kid
Bro i was just watching one of your videos
Why specifically 426 pumpkins?
Glad to see you’re still uploading content! And that thing about YouTubers not being energetic is so true.
so uh..... nobody's gonna finish the rest of that picnic?  Welp... *begins to start putting on a cloth around his neck pulling out a fork and knife* time to eat!
Now this is CONTENT
I think my biggest childhood fixation was the idea that I would not be a girl anymore and be a boy. This was before I discovered what transgender meant. And when I did, it made me feel a lot better in my skin. But anyway, when I was little I always said my boy name would be Lyle cause my birth name was Lyella. My parents played along to some extent because they wanted me to have an open minded experience. And I dropped it for a while. Then my mom told me that when she was pregnant with me everyone tried to convince her that I was a girl but for some reason she knew I was a boy. If I was a boy she wanted to name me Asher. And here we are. I'm an archer and an Asher.
YOUR BACK
Maybe phase where I had Gu*s
Ok but can we appreciate the background?
Bindle
20 minutes gang!
In case anyone was curious on what the letter says but too lazy to pause it:  "Dear Mom and Dad, I ran away from home to find my own life. I will build my own house and find my own food. I will find a job and get some money. Don't worry about me and put up signs that say have you seen me. I will come and visit you. You can come and visit me too. I will give you my address when I find it.  Love, Rebecca P.S. I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, and I will miss you. Bye!"
My mom saved a letter I had written when I was like 7. She had grounded me, and I basically said she could only be part of my family if she ungrounded me, but that I loved her.  Very twisted, but we still laugh over it.
I am here
1:01 Whaaaat?? Noooo
She really needs to explain this lol
🛹
Why am I not surprised that Rebecca needs 426 pumpkins for the upcoming spooky season?
:(  Your Robot number of 362277 has been hacked. You are gonna get a refund.
One time my younger sister, about age four or five, got it into her head she wanted to run away. I was ten at the time and had read every single Ramona Quimby book, so I knew the logical thing was to just slow her down till she got tired of the idea. So I helped her pack her favorite My little Ponies and a bible, and started walking her down the road. While we walked I started talking about how much we loved her and how much we'd miss her and all that jazz until she burst into tears, sat down in the gutter and started begging me to take her back, which I did. Mom never found out, and my sister denies that this ever happened, instead claiming I was the one running away and she was just following me.
0:54 A TRANSFORMERS phase
Easy to see where Rebecca got her acting props from. Anyway, we really do be weird kids; I remember one phase where I thought my GODMOTHER was my real mom and that I was adopted...all because of Jochebed from "Prince Of Egypt" (thanks Ofra Haza)...And no, I don't know how I came to that weird hypothesis when me, my godmother and Jochebed look nothing alike from each other.
Leave it up to becca to make me stop skating just to watch an amazing video
So I ran away once when I was 3, and my parents found me having a full blown conversation with the construction workers down the street about my favorite Pete the cat book
The best thing to wake up to
Missed you Girl
I CAN UNDERSTAND NOW! THIS IS AWESOME! HEHEHEHEH
I would always come home to somebody after school, so that wouldn't work for me. And my house has an alarm system, so if I tried to run away when someone was home, they'd know XD
THE QUEEN HAS ARISEN
Finally she posted! IM SO HAPPY :3
Let's be real. Everyone has thought of doing this when they were kids.                                                                  there is not here                                                        stop                                         okay you die know
Yes, FINALLY,HELLO DEAR WITCH OF THE WOODS
As always you make us smile. Thank you!
23,761st view
Rebecca! Your pumpkins have arrived!
"You're weird, but I like you."
Yes!! Another video from Rebecca!!
She is not dead what a relief
IM EARLY
eyy ten minutes ago, thats a record for me
a
If it makes you feel better, I am a teen and am interested in the concept of running away
Ah yes, another story completed with a happy ending
It’s kind of sad because her Dad died
My younger half brother actually tried to run away. Though my birthgiver didn't help by trying to make him stay outside in the cold in just his underwear and a sleeping bag  (He was like six I think but also she was very abusive but she let him back in like an hour later I think, maybe less than that I don't remember)
Ñ
finally she is here !
AYYE!
She is back! (Reply if you had ever ACTUALLY ran away) (i had twice)
What are you planning on doing with those pumpkins? Do you have a Halloween surprise for us?
Yessssss. Such a good timing. Just came home from work 🥺❤️
Eyyyyy back with a new , beatifull video i loved this one too
Rebecca, Care to share some cake with you're little oodalalie? Me? C:     (Idk how to spell it btw! sorry lol)
**Sees title**                                                                                          Oh dear baby Becca what did you do this time                                                               I had a weird mlp phase but I was still a weird kid who watched Pokémon so much and screamed all the Pokémon calls                                   Literally me as when I was: *PIKACHUUUUUUUUUUUUUU*                                                                         ok but know I am just a anime obsessed person I also used to hide from my parents like this and yea see you net time rebecca
Hey! let me explain studios posted! My day is made!
Becca: “a joke that was my idea”  Also Becca: “mom had an awful idea”
I love how your mom and sister were in on the joke too 🤣
Its been a while  Kinda
claim your before  1 hour ticket here
Me and my family loves messing with each other too, but the pranks were mostly towards me, and I fall for every, single, one. lol TwT
Early 😈
I thought either a squirrel was going to pop out or a guy with a ton of pumpkins
I once tried to run away and only made it up 3 houses and I was like “yea no I ain’t doin this” and returned. Idek what happened to make me want to run away and I told my parents years later and they didn’t even know XD
DONT CALL ME THAT
Did the demon of the woods find her? 😨
I LOVE IT!  I LOVE THAT YOU ARE MY FAVORITE ANIMAIR AND ROMANIAN LOVE YOU❤️💕👑 Nice suit
That singing in the beginning though, beautiful
Those backgrounds are pretty nice!
Yeees
Lore ending.
Well, that ending isn't  ominous at all.....
10 mins
Marvelous
YAY SHE'S BACK
✌️😎
Long supporter right here bin here since 200 000k
its crazy she spent like a month of animating for 10m of enjoyment, this job is painstaking hard
I never knew I needed to see Becca’a characters doing the grinch smile thing. I’m happy to now have this
Your mother is an evil genius when she said let's get your dad
1:12 I actually thought that was Jaiden for a sec because of her animated persona's little "hair floofs"
I clicked it so fast that my finger is still hurting until now 😅😅
She said peace ✌🏼
My family's love language is messing with each other
returning when she was most needed
Another lovely video thank you and thank you for the nice picnic view 🥰 you keep our heart smiling stay beautiful
That background at the beginning is absolutely gorgeous
Did something happen to her second channel??
Yay, another video 😁
It feels like 20 years since you last posted
I love your video’s
YES SHES BACK!!
I wonder what life would be like if humans didn't exist
Yes the best story teller is back!!!!
I once ran away with a suitcase full of spaghettios and had to go back home after a couple minutes because all of the cans got too heavy
Yep, definitely had my dinosaur phase. 24 years later I'm still in it.
Was….that….foreshadowing?? Rebecca girl what are you planning?
No Becca i'm thinking of FINALLY AN UPLOAD MY LIFE IS COMPLETE
It's time to tune out
When was the last time you posted
Awesome video 😁😁😁😁 can believe you pranked him liked that😂😂😂
One time I “ran away”. I literally just stood on the edge of the driveway for 10 minutes
Pog
Hey she's still alive
I am NOT running away from my mashed potatoes!
Medium unexpected video xd
The fact that the note is so positive makes it a little more believable to me. As a kid I was way more likely to do something because I was stupid and thought it actually a good idea than to do something because I was angry. I’m sure not all kids are like that but my siblings and I were. I never actually would have run away but if I did, it would more likely be like this. ‘Love you mom but I want to live in the wild like a squirrel princess’ or something of the sort.
Who was so fast
me wait for a jump scare at the end: 👁👄👁
This video was so good 😊😂
Once when a was me and my older brother had a Tom and Jerry faze and we drove our perents insane
how does this only have 2k veiws but 3k likes-   (igot here a lil early btw)
Fun fact my friends think I ran away to a new family because I look absolutely different from the rest of them
First 10 minutes
*we do a little tomfoolery*
I don't feel bad for your dad but...      I feel bad for the cake 🎂😕😞😢😔😫🎂
I’m first omg I’m so happy hi
Before 10 mins club 👍✌️
Fuck yes your back 😂😆
Lol, ur mom’s reaction to ur “run away” is the same as that South Park episode where Cesare Milan made a guest appearance 🤣🤣
Your vids really bring me joy! Thank you!❤️
Wait but what about the 426 pumpkins? I need answers!!!
I DON'T HAVE MONEY TO BUY REBECCA'S MERCHANDISE 😭😭😭😭
Hey
The ending DAMN!!!
It’s ok I’m weird to
I can't believe it. You painted the Grinch's Smirk on your mom's toon avatar, in your signature mouthless style, and it still 👏 FREAKIN'👏 WORKED!! That is skill! Hats off to you, Ms. Parham! Good show!!
Funny my mom probably just yell at me and ground me for a month
Awesome! I love these story time videos.
At the end when she heard noises I expected her to come back with a baseball bat or something.
Yay a new video
Who is this worth a three month wait                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yes. Yes it was
I swear when I say I clicked this notification so fast as soon as I saw it
this took so long to come out, but it was so worth it. The quality is so gooood
The fact that this was up loaded 7 minutes ago and it already has 18k views
Omg she's alive!!
27 Likes , no views 68 comments. Don’t you just love YouTube
6:47 Holy crap. Child Becca somehow has neater handwriting than 23-year-old me has now.
That's alot of pumpkins. For the next video perhaps?
who does a picnic and JUST SITS THERE FOR 8 MINUTES TELLING A CAMERA A STORY AND NOT EATING      the food is gonna rot lol
She..Back? SHE,S BACK!!
0:50  i had the three of them XD
That ending kinda made me wanna cry. The "who would wanna run away from that" kinda hurt for some reason :,)
Ive got too run away
Soooooo guess what my name is Rebecca ( I go by hope) and my older sisters name is Rachel 😁
6:17 HAHAHAHAHA I CANT STOP LAUGHING
Off-Topic..     *me wondering why animators doesn't have discord Groups*
im thinking of doing that soon............fr my fam is not the happiest thing😗
She's back!!!!!!
In the deepest darkest day I get a good video to cure it
oh my gosh 😂 if I ever did this I'd probably get dropkicked by my parents
This was hilarious 😂
Is there heating in your house in the woods? For the winter? Or are we sending blankets?
Well now I understand why you take an eternity to upload, the quality is next level! Love it!
:D you uploaded!
I also went through a phase where I’d pretend to run away by putting stuff in a blanket on a stick and going to a different room/hiding in the backyard/“moving” into the tree house
Oh, I was stupid. See, during the 80s there was plenty of tv plots regarding running away and I thought 'Hey, everything will be an adventure and I can get lots of hugs from my parents and this will teach 'em to stop yelling at me!' I was four. One very chaotic winter day I was like 'I will just run away!' and my dad said 'Good luck!' as he opened the door to almost two feet of snow; me, I was wearing a pair of shorts and a t-shirt. So, when I finally had my own kids and they started emulating television tropes I and my then wife had a great laugh and a great learning experience ready.
SHE RETURNS
I found this video 8 minutes after its been uploaded without notifications
I remember I got really mad at my mom and was gonna run away with my ds and my favorite stick. And when I opened the garage door to leave my mom just stood next to me and said "well. I'm waiting. Dont let all the cool air out"
I tried running away to live with the power rangers when I was 4 and I got all packed up and then I realized I couldn't cross the street without an adult I asked my mom and brother and they said no and my dad was asleep so I couldn't ask him
Yesss she's back!
Hi
I would do that *if my dad wouldn’t beat me* 🥲😁
Bro, how are you so beautiful??
This was funny XD
okay why was the ending so unnerving
she always come back
U didn’t even finish the outro lol
Aychristene is going to love this video.
I've been waiting every day and every minute to arrive and was so excited and filled with joy that she made another video
I did the same thing as a kid but I didn't leave a note or anything I just got up and left and I was half way done hill when I walked back home because I got scared
I also did a prank on my mom calling her and telling her our house was on fire.
Tha ks for the video Becca. We should picnic again sometime!
I packed my penguin bag and walked outside and went back in
She can now become the witch of the woods, a mysterious, dark but magical place where vile beasts, and other earthly things collide. Where there is no precautions for what dangers could happen. Where mysterious and questionable creatures are found. Will Rebecca make it out alive and rule the woods as the witch that she was meant to be or will she have to face the consequences and be a slave to mother nature... Find out now on, "Running away from home".
Ugh I love these vids so damn much! They’re so iconic!
The grinch face lmao 4:21
who does a picnic for JUST 8 minutes
WHAT WAS THAT ENDING???? BECCA WHAT ARE U TRYING TO TELL US???
pse
What was that thing that happened at the end?
Great video!
Fun pikinik.

THE GREAT ANIMATOR HAS RETURNED ✨👄✨
She never tuned out .....😳
It's nice to see you again
...what was that noise
Not the cliff hanger
ah sweet free cake
This was much more wholesome than I expected and I love that.
The part where your dad found you has me crying from laughing so hard 🤣
cool
4:19 I think this part is made funnier by the fact that she doesn’t have a mouth
these are so funny i wish she posted more
For any younglings in this here comment section, the elder siblings do know better but not in reason or intellect but in humor they know the bestest of ways to mess with the little ones
Finally after three months...
Isn't that just how all families work?

Early gang-
Been a LONG fucking time since I got a Becca notification, about fucking time I missed her
Yay the queen of stories
YESS 🙌
Can we just talk about how good that mama grinch smile was without the smile. Pure quality!
This title sounds like something the crazy witch Rebecca would do
Becca has literally done everything kids thought of doing going on the roof, running away, secretly buying things off the internet it’s crazy!  By the way becca if you are reading this I love your videos your awesome

We've all tried to run away from home but pizza night made us stay 🍕
1:39 I DID THE SAME THING Sorta I would take LED candels we had and make a fort on the bathroom floor, Pretend it was a Witch hide out  I thought it was just me 🤣  Also I went through this thing with gymnastics where I would tell my teammate to meet me at the top window at 12 PM, I said I was gonna sneak out and come to gym  Never happened though 🤣
I saw you were going to upload on mom's phone lol
Yes
Rebecca looks like the nice neighbor until you step on her porch
SHES BACK

You're the best Becca. I love your videos 😂♥️

Rebecca  would make a great nurse anchor
Omg yes our treehouse witch is back 😁
hey becca i made u in gacha life go watch it i think youll like it! ...unes i post it....
I ran away too with my best friend when we were like 4. After packing some Elsa and Anna backpacks we booked it for a gate that would let us into the wild! Yeah no, we didn't make it far. Darn you babysitter! You have ruined our evil plan!
4:20 if any one has seen the short story animation of how the Grinch stole Christmas. Then that is the look along with his mouth of his evil look.
🏵
I wasn't thinking that. But I did miss you buddy.
“When we wanted her most, she did not return, when we needed her most, she did and she always does” ~ Master Oogway
Nice video!
It's so hard to imagine that an eight-minute video takes three months... I can't even imagine how hard it is for youtube animators. I wish you luck, Rebecca!
First
5 minutes
Lol
I thought I was early lol
Becca you are helping AMAZING and i need you to post more often very appreciated
Your dad is awesome
Hello how are you today 😊
Ur lucky because when I was like 10 or11 I couldn’t go anywhere by myself like to the shops 😓

Make a ritual
That grinch reference was spot on
This comment was put up before anyone's finished the video
Yeash Becca how long did that background take?
Yey
I cant believe I’m on a Let Me Explain video in the first 5 minutes.
Yay
Yas
Wow I’m early
I can tell your mom did the grinch face by the eyes
I did not see this coming
The one thing we tried to do when are parents got mad at us 😂
Love the grinch reference
Let’s get your dad the grinch said
Look at all those likes before they even finish the video
3 seconds and already there are over 500 “first” comments in the comment section.
Anyone came to rewatch old videos
Not the grinch refrence
Hi
Nice Vid
Here at 4min wow 👌
Not first
Just when the world was crumbling apart and we needed her, she returned
i  love this
The grinch mother
Let me run away to my secluded creepy tree house . . . forever.
4:17 she turned into the grinch Lol 😂
Why hello Becca
I havent watched the video yet but take my like :)
Wow in a few seconds 1.3K comments..I WAS FIRST HAHA
Cool video by the way
First 5 mins yay Rebecca your the best love your content :)
I had multiple phases that included all three you mentioned
I remember i wanted to run away and put all my favorite cloths in my suitcase but as time went on i forgot about thr suitcase and got sad about all my favorite cloths went missing XDD
“A dinosaur phase”  It wasn’t a phase, it was a way of living… I made my profile picture after dilophosaurus wetherilli  Yes I just said the full scientific name of dilophosaurus to prove my point.
Yay another animation!!!!
HOLY SH!T SHES BACK
First Minutes and it’s at 12k views
I need more Rebecca in this moments
Finally thank you for a new video is this is amazing
Love you
I almost forgot about you!
It’s aways nice to tune in on Rebecca’s Videos and life stories. Am I right?
I once ran away from my house for real and walked one mile because I wanted to see my great grandmother but then I got caught by my grandma :)
When the world needed her the most, *She returned.*
Nice to see u recovered.
When your finally early to a video and you can’t think of any comments so you spend the whole time thinking up funny comments and forget to watch the video and then go back to watch the video…
"I believe everyone of us as children went through phases"  Hmm.. does picking up random things from the ground count as a phase?
I mean we all were weird and in some cases including me are weird to this day because honestly if we all were normal this world would be boring
How can Rebecca talk without a mouth?
Current and past latchkey kid suprememcey 😎
The merch link dont work
Umm the devil human children has a merged
Finally another video to watch instead of re watching the others
Vid was such a mood. I was kicked out a month ago.
I'm just gonna assume she ran away to the tree house where she would soon become the Witch of the Woods
Omg Qeen is back !!! :DDD
Hey. Is anyone else amazed at how funny and charismatic Rebecca can be? I mean, she never fails to bring a smile to my face and just sounds so genuine! Rebecca Parham, you are one amazing, kind, funny, beautiful soul, and thanks for always making me laugh and brightening my day. I've loved your videos for a long time, so, yeah. You're amazing!
Finally a video
Hi Rebecca
YEA MY IDOL IS BACK!! 🥰
Why is this the best thing ever?!!
hi Becca my name is J.R. and I love you :]
I love how you make the pigtails little devil horns- 😂😈
Put me in avid
Like your video
Your art style is great
Yaaaayyy!! Another video! :D
I love your videos they are funny.
WHEN WE NEEDED HER SHE RETURNED!
Rebecca with her crazy backstories as a little devil child.
I've always had a weird fascination with rainy days, driving through the country, listening to lo-fi and chilling. Just a weird vibe I've always wanted to have and I did it a while ago and it was amazing.
Good this I coded this so no one can sub to this channel try it... if you dare
My day is better now!
THE WORST PHASE IS HAVING A SONIC PHASE.!😖😖😖
I can’t believe the last time I watched you was when I was 15. That was 3 years ago. I have a job now. Everything in my life changed when i was 15. My dad left us,  my grandad passed. And your videos got me through the hard times.  I’m so happy your still making videos. Thank you for getting me through the hard times.
We partake in a minute amount of tomfoolery
Finally
Our Witch Of The Woods ghost story girl is back! :D
when your days 10 times better because she posted:
Amazing as always love your videos and animations
Me: where’s my reason to smile and feel happiness today. Rebecca uploads: ah there it is.   (Rebecca your videos make me so happy especially when I’m stressed out or need to have something to make me happy, especially how you do these with little details like 6:28)  I hope you know that you are my reason to smile today and most likely many others here.
oh boy, this is gonna be so entertaining! 😂😂
Oh boy these kind of stories, we all know how they end and anyone who hadn't watched Nostalgia Critic's North review for awhile should know.  Also; I bet your taking a regular stroll and just heading back to your treehouse of yours or regular home.
I kind of like how all of Becca’s videos are giving her animated character a story of living in the woods as a watch apart from her irl self
I ran away once and I was gone for 2 weeks
Becca: we never stop having phases Me: AgREeD✨  Also me : although being emo will never be a PhASe✨😝
Rebecca:I was weird not stupid  Me: 🤣🤣🤣
I’m not first but I’m early
Yes Rebbeca!
im pretty sure we all locked ourselves in the bathroom for one reason or another.
bro.. its been so long.
My life is complete
Hi
I love your videos ❤❤❤❤
2:07 when Rebeccas mom has skull eyes you know she's mad
Let's all be honest we all thought about running away when our parents gave us a beating
Rebecca? How many times have you changed Toon Becca's outfit in her lifetime?
Yay you created a new video!
Dis vid is gonna be good
Okay but can we just appreciate Becca making animations that are such high quality? ✨
Helllo

Rebecca!!!! Wahoo!
You know what  I'm sure everyone has considered running away every once in a while  So you do you
Man I feel like running away is a part of a particular type of young childhood cuz I can't say it's happened to everyone but certain things just make it happen that is relatable
A videooo
As a kid I would pack my bag and give up bc who would feed me
