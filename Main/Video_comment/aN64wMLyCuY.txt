Congratulations. What a machine. Absolutely mind boggling performance. I’d spec mine in a very similar fashion (if I won the lottery!).
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 großartig
Brilliant! EVs give the ultimate drive!
Amg 1 is just less impressive
But You forgot to drift 😭
Mate. 💛🙏 🧠👍
Hi Nico, I hope you're all good.
There is no other production car than this that would benefit from a 5-point harness.
Menudo coche, hasta el  Nicolás se hagradese de forma i de detalles que se encuentra en el super Quay
hi nico when r u making a comeback
Gloves😂😂😂😂!
"These guys don't feel sorry" I felt that
24:04 good one
18:16 i see
sind die weißen Handschuh wegen den feuchten Beifahrer fingern..? hehe
Man I’m poor 😢😂
I had the pleasure of meeting Mate years ago. Fantastic guy.
7:48-8:00 that music fits perfect
The car maker looks scared to death at times and you can almost see the gears turning in his head (I'm never doing a test ride again with a customer) 😂
wow
“Common sense” comment was great…Car is fantastic
Elon could learn a thing or two from Mate…..!
If you want autonomous driving get a chauffeur……
Nico is funny 🤣
🤣🤣 @6:35 There are few things more satisfying to me than scaring my passengers, uh...  brainless! 🤣
WHO would imagine that Mate Rimac will be appointed as Bugatti/Rimac CEO in two years and will create the most beautiful and fastest Bugatti will ever be built, THE BUGATTI TOURBILLON. Amazing person.
These guys don’t feel sorry…😂😢❤
Lotus Exige in drag
Mate's face 😅 Crazy great car
One of the most beautiful and impressive cars I have ever seen.
Thank you Nico for bringing out the fact that the CEO is afraid of his own product is a massive success to show how perfect a hypercar is
Hi where is your Nevera today? Is it driving? Is it worth the money?😂
You hide the speed monitor ey ? Speed limits in Croatia,very smart and dirty at the same time, bravo Nico and Mate,both kings...
NIKO, can you ask if Mate has a Model of this fabulous piece of art like a 12" replica.....seriously...
It is a shame that Hennessey did not drive the Nevera just to see what he is up against and to appreciate what Mate has achieved.  Then allow Mate to drive the Venom F5 to see what that is all about....that would be cool. Same thing should go for Koenigsegg and other Manufacturers where they all meet up with their rides and share their experiences as Artists and developers.
Imagine one of the greatest drivers ever telling you your small startup car is better than a LaFerrari and Mercedes AMG
5:30 that's when rimac realised 😅
Some will win some will loose
I have never seen an owner of a car brand being scared of going too fast in his own car. Amazing and crazy at the same time
Really you're not fooling anybody you don't want a paycheck because you don't want to pay any taxes then you can always borrow money against your stocks from the bank and never have to use your money so you're not fooling anybody😌
what is the range on this car before it has to be recharged? (not that I'll ever be able to afford one)
🧡💜💛💙💚❤
A beautiful car! From every aspect. Never change the design, it will always be new even, I would say, 10 years from now.
This guy is a gem, the way he speak about his colleagues and how he speaker’s about his work is inspiring, he said he can’t own his he until he buys one that means a lot when you look at it from a employee perspective and that’s so humble, I would love to work with him
Nico asks literally the best questions , 100% composed while pushing the car and actually listening . Amazing video , this was almost like an audiobook 😭😭
Nevera look so good in close up😌
There is a La Ferrari with front motor, it's called a 918 Spyder 🙂
The performance numbers are record breaking, but the looks are boring.
so something do people from Croatia, and Tesla Nikola is from Croatia, ops Tesla is from USA, nobody clam for authorization of name
"Who is this random dude driving this bespoke supercar..." Checks Wiki: Former F1 Driver "I'm so sorry"
El coche es electrico???
The life of an ex F1 driver looks pretty dull if you ask me 😂
Looks like Nico doesn't miss the engine roar
What a fantastic video,  seeing a professional driver put this car through its paces was amazing. More please!!
7:15 anyone knows which car hes talking about?
@NicoRosberg I’ve watched quite a few of your videos now and it’s great to see such a humble down to earth guy doing what he loves I wish you all the best for the future
He was so scared of Nico's driving lol
If I would have 10 million $, I would buy shares in Rimac just to be near this guy. Such a role model
"What do you think of the car, thumbs up / thumbs down ?" Why would you ask that ? hahaha how could someone click thumbs down for this amazing car ? :)) Lovely, enjoy it to the fullest Nico!
What a great car, with l could afford one.
Que aburrimiento uhhh
Honestly it is so sad to see the bugatti name close to the last name of new dude that got famous because he makes electric components.  I really don't see the point of why his last name should be associated with Bugatti, he's hitting the brand and associating Ettore Bugatti to his Name. I am sure the financial reasons of why he got Bugatti is that he put himself in making tons of components for VW, between drivetrain and batteries and they gave him a brand that is in a net loss 2.6 billion in 30 years...  This car is a useless piece of nothing in a sea of more iconic and prestigious cars and in a non profitable market.  2 billion evaluation and 500 million liquidity... with a 200 million investment... we will see... I think is set to fail... especially having Bugatti in Portfolio.
I like how the previous video was: We have 14 cameras so you don't need a GoPro and they instantly mounted 2 GoPros
Stunning car.. and what a nice bloke mate is.. gives everyone shares in the company 👏🏻 would love to see you drive the car on a track.. 🤞🏼😁
Excellent Vid💯 What is the name of the song @ 15:15 to 16:02
Nico buy the Mcmarty Spielberg track version. That thing will run circles around redbull's f1 car. 5:35 no no i quite like track mode 😂
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
You're old enough to drive? 😄
Couldn’t give a shite 😂
21:27 😮
This car looks amazing but the engine sound is just terrible, a RX-7 with 4 rotors sounds way better.
You ask awesome questions great video👊🏾
Best line, these guys don't feel sorry!
really love how you share your knowledge about F1 track using simracing on others video. After French youtuber like pog and GMK ( test koenigsegg) and choucroute garage (tesla ) , i am now discover the amazing  Rimac nevera supercar ! . Tesla plaid was insane (price and speed) from non professionnal driver .... hear " insane " many times   from a pro driver  let me speechless !!
imagine with some black rims mhm👀
CLEANEST CAR
It looks like a combination of McLaren p1, Corvette c8 and Porsche Carrera Gt.
If I drove that car Id break ALL records no matter who was driving on the other cars.
”This car has 14 cameras so you dont have to bother yourself with the gopros” 😂
I love how you keep asking " How you doing Martin?" while pushing the car to corners ,LOL,this car is insane.
Mate handeld it much better than Rubinio in other video !🤣
C7 corvette from front view. Super tech and power.
i hope i never have to ride along in a car driven by a actual f1 racer  Please God never make it happen even if you consider it "lucky"  NO i would never want to be in one
Beautiful car!
the owner was praying for his life the whole video
Nico is TOP G
is this the same car that Richard Hammond totaled?
I like how the Rimac guy only talks about "interesting things" when talking about autonomous driving, he makes no promises he cant hold like some other CEO of an electric car company.
Beautiful car , great video 💯🤙
What is here rational about! Why should someone would like to have this kind of very things?! So useless.
it is not 2K HP but 1914HP, but video´s quite cool
Met is sounding exactly like Elon when they came out with the model s. Confident, optimistic and passionate. Wishing them so much success especially with they autonomous and battery packing ventures.
👍
Nice car but is it really worth 2 million? It only has a 300 mile range from battery power.  I suppose it is the fastest road car in the world at the moment. How long with that last and then the deprecation.
was so nice listen you guys chat and would like to hear what Elon would think about Nevera.
Rimac was scared. But it's understandable I've ridden with racers and they are aggressive drivers. Great car don't break it.
Very charming that the Founder is basically "just a car Geek" who would never use the Machines he builds, as they where ment to be used 😅
Do Not use the name of my Savior and God in vain 6:50  Jesus Christ
THE MOST POWERFUL PRODUCTION CAR. WONDER HOW IT FEELS TO SAY THAT AND KNOW ITS TRUE
Boys! Its over! Any Tesla roadster will show you its rear lights.
Nico , what I would like to know is when are you going to drive it around the Nuremberg??? I'm sure everyone would love to see that video. Stay kuhl
Very similar looking to the McClaren.
12:34 is this sped up?
That whirring noise has to get old quick -- it's even annoying from a video standpoint lol
what a car and what an awesome human mate is just from listening to these 2s conversation about his company  best wishes to you guys you deserve it 100%
I love, love, love it! Love Nevera! Perfection of perfection!
"because it's more than enough" well said
It's front looks like a combination of McLaren's front and Aston Martin's front
Best part of video is guy with camera 😂😂😂😅😅😅
i think your passenger holds record for longest grin on TV  This confirms his love for his creation!
World class level advert for this car.😮
A beautiful car! Beautifully built, and beautifully drivien!
so fun and professional !!🇫🇷👍
I drove through that area in my Miura I hope the roads are better!
Looks fun to drive, especially in the area where you are now, congrats on your new ride! Greetings from Florida
I mean ur in a car with F1 guy who beat LEWIS so yeah id tryst him. These guys are BRED to push to limit. They rarely have road accidents ive heard of
Way too much Traction in sports mode
Warum sprechen die beiden eigentlich nicht Deutsch? Muss halt mal ein englischer Untertitel für die Welt her.
The real genius of this car is all the control systems.
12:18 Nico : set from sport to track mode Mate : panic panic panic Nico :  that's insane, it's insane, really insanee Mate : panic, panic, really panic (i prefer shut up) lol XD XD
Well you can have twice the fun at half the speed. Having seen the car in the flesh close up its rather dull, couple that with boring soundtrack and 2.3t weight it just doesn't add up to me. Give a million people a day in this and a T.50 then ask them to choose one, I doubt get a single individual choosing the Rimac. As supercars go, this is going in the wrong direction.
please do Budh International Circuit, Indian GP track analysis
Amazing car.
nico is so cool and chilled just having a bit of fun
love thems rims
Good investment and good lack, hope to see more of you driving the car.
Driving round those roads. I was feeling anxiety just watching this.
Awesome dialogue!
Amazing car and Mate is such a great down to earth genius! Cool video also!
Komšije da li ste vi svesni šta imate? Ovo je kao kod nas Novak Đoković.Svaka čast Mate,živ bio..
Beautiful car, Nico is such a nice person, I hope Rimac is a great success
Wauw 😍😍😍
So interesting what he said about wanting to keep the Bugatti package a hybdrid. Throughly enjoyed this video. I wonder if you could film a few laps around a track. That would be insane!
D a reden 2  die  deutsch können Englisch.   Ante.   Ist ein E Pioneer.   Erst der Deal mit Porsche, nun mit Bugatti. Da weiss man wer wem braucht !!
The man ask you not to be respectful to him !
I spent 24 minutes watching this video. It is remarkable how Nico enjoys driving and speed.
After Laferrari, it's hard to find a better car, even if it's a Rimac
7:43 "These guys don't feel sorry"  oh boy, there is a story behind that and I'd love to hear it... I kind of feel sorry for him in that part.  I like that he treats everyone with openness. More power to him on that front.
What kind of mad person would put a thumbs down to this video.
super video Nico, really enjoyed it
Rimac is headed up. Humble guy, great car.
WOW. That's out of this world !!! NICE !!
How many miles/ kilometers do you get ?
His own invention scares him. He might know precisely the safety of the car, but when your are a passenger, you are just that. A passenger.
You have to drive it on the Nürnburgring.
What do we think of the car? You're killing me man.
Congraduate Mate Rimac, on well behaving with the employees by dividing sharing with them. What ever want that somebody do for you, to it yourself for him. Jesus Christ gospel. on
Panama papers man? Nico not good
HOW COULD YOU NOT WANT TO BE A MULTI MILLIONAIRE WHEN THERE'S THIS TO BUY, SUCH A SPECIAL CAR, MY NEW DREAM CAR
ask Jarod Shelby to race you in his tuatara and you will see that you wasted your money on this car
Grande Nico. Great interview!
Sorry, Nico, couldn't understand the name of the car. I googled it. The volime.may have been too quiet.    The video is more of a class and unfortunately doesn't allow viewers to actually see the car in motion.  It is a boring video and I would not waste 25 min of  my time.    Please offer footage and a voice over of the car from a distance.  Then, if you want to teach us in the car.  Be safe.
Wow
Wow! Amazing!!
Quiero una Nevera  llena de cervezas
Ok i might not be the first to say this and perhaps a few years too late, Nico should be the fourth bloke on Grand Tour along side Hamster, Jezza and Cappy Slow. I havent laughed like this watching a guy having fun in an expensive car since the good old days.
Mr passenger you sound like a good boss
"My daughter - hopefully not."
Electric Supercars are trash I need that V12
I Met mate YES
: /  HEY NICO,  THIS IS MY FIRST TIME BECOMING AWARE OF YOU AND THIS CAR.  I WATCHED THE VIDEO COMPLETELY, I PAID CAREFUL ATTENTION, AND I HAVE LEARNED THAT YOU ARE FORMER FORMULA ONE RACE CAR DRIVER!  AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS CAR IS A STREET LEGAL LUXURY FORMULA ONE MACHINE!  NOW HERE ARE MY FINAL THOUGHTS ABOUT ALL OF THIS....   I THINK THE PEOPLE THAT MADE THIS CAR A REALITY?  SHOULD ALSO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE THIS CAR AVAILABLE FOR "ANYONE AND EVERYONE" THAT WANTED ONE!!!!!!  : /   WHY SHOULD ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO SOMEHOW HAVE ALL THE MONEY, ALL THE COMFORT, ALL THE LUXURY, ALL THE RESOURCES, ALL THE CONNECTIONS, ALL THE BEST OF EVERYTHING THERE IS IN THIS WORLD, BE ABLE TO HAVE ONE OF THESE??????????????    : /    PLEASE PASS MY THOUGHTS UP THE LATTER!  THANK YOU ~
Why the white 🧤?
Rimac... what a nice guy!
Mate looked like he was about to throw up for most of this video while Nico felt impressed, humbled, and right at home with the car which would naturally make sense given his F1 experience.  Pretty nuts!
NICO, so che parli bene italiano… SEI UN GRANDE e Mate ha creato un auto strepitosa, vogliamo vederti in DRIFT… 💪💪💪💪
Mcm proton punya agenda yal
Incredible piece of engineering!👌🏻 Mate always comes across as a top bloke! If only all managers/CEO’s were like him!🤷🏼‍♂️
21:35 I was really interested in hearing this man’s story.  Maybe not the right time to speak about it but I’d love to hear an in depth interview.  Seriously, capitalism should be required to give shares to employees.  What a man!  I’m no economist or genius business person but it makes sense to help employees more invested in the company.  I guess I’ll be looking for an interview with this man.  Thanks for being good
I like that Nico is so down to earth, being genuinely interested in other people.
This car will turn all super cars into glorified riding lawn mowers
Great video.......enjoy your new car, but what about your new yacht, when is that being delivered ??
if nico is impressed, im impressed.
If he can't trust the guy who beat a 7 time world champion in equal machinery then he can't trust his own product.
Well.  I'm so glad you have enough cash to flaunt your wealth to the rest of the world.  I have now blocked you from returning to my feed.  I'm not even going to watch the video, I stopped it at 0:01 to publish my comment.  I am so sick and tired of watching you rich people show-case your wealth on YouTube and other social media.  I hate Minecraft videos, but would really rather watch one of them as to watch videos like this again.
What do you mean try the lap record😂 i've never seen keke racing but he must've been insane!
Matte going Aarh, urgh on turns and acceleration cracked me up 🤣
Wait, did Nico just say he hoped his kid wouldn't become a race driver - as the kid is a daughter?! Seriously?    It's fine if he is not too hot on the idea but to tie it to gender as it really sounded like he did, that's sad. She literally has half the genes of an F1 champ in her, not a bad start and a dad who knows how to race. For him to be so dismissive of the idea in this day and age really made me lose respect.  Hope I interpreted that wrong. Hope it's just some protection mode he is in.
So ein teueres Auto und so ein hässlicher Rückspiegel 😂
6:54 Yes, but this guy is Nico Rosberg you know..
Your talking about cars and company couture was best.
hope you love the car nico and hope mate showed you the beautiful cost in croatia (dubrovnik,split,rovinj,hvar,cavtat,too many to list)....if not he needs to take you there on the next rimac car you buy :)...make it part of the deal!.....:)
One unique feature of all hypercars is that they are all driven by   Hyper A--holes!!!
Is this your first time driving a fast electric car? :)
Nico is it came in monaco yet
Awesome car, your emotion experience you got from the drive was like riding with you. You should try it on track 100% power!!! Insane
Kannst du den Nürburgring Rekord knacken ?
haha, I was trying to see how fast are they going and speedometer is blurred XD Great job on the car Mate (and the rest of the team),  much love from Serbia!
I would ride with Nico.  Just floor that machine…. Roll that beast over I don’t care…
Mr rimac mindset is so unique and transparent,  it  makes me wanna become a cleaner for his company lol, imagine how everyone will look after the company,  if they steal or laze around the company will do bad and their own share  price will drop , he is so motivating , I can see it's not about the money for him , the man has true passion , goals and a strong mindset.
@carwow get this drag race done 🔥
Rimac no.1👏👏👏👏
"Way too much traction control, why is there so much traction control in sport?"
Where can they race it legally?
This video by far ties with koeniggsegg  the best car reviews I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen every car out there
If this car is good doing laptime?
The interview about Bugatti was brilliant
This is turbo jet on the road!!!This is future is now))
their is no EV infrastructure to support, it's a bad political democrat NWO idea it won't and can't work for the unforeseen future
Get a Tesla model s plaid More spacious and nice trunk Good family car. Call Elon for a test drive .
observe the map navigation...NOT GOOD
Mate looks more impressed with Nico than Nico is impressed with the car.
Nico est comme un enfant avec entre les mains le plus beau jouet du monde, pendant que Mat est dans ses petits souliers, complètement terrifiés par les accélérations de sa bombe routière. Sublime. Félicitations. 👍🏼♥️
it's a Ferrari 550 from the front... like it
Love the look on his face when you start have some fun with power priceless.
6:19
Diver meet machanic talk about car in deeply that u dint understand what are they really talk about. Its not like car buyers meet dealer. Very unusual way they talked about car.😅
Love these two very natural conversation
Top Gear. First mention.
I bet and hope that’s the last time he rides with a customer. Would hate to lose a visionary such as Mate to an accident with a new driver in one of his cars.
Impressive car!  Thanks for the video!
Hey Nico, great work. love to see you driving  in F1, But then again congratulation for having the courage to quit
Wassup Rico!!!   Rock on!   😎
Great car 🚗
Thanks, great video!
“These guys don’t feel sorry” 😂 I believe it
sounds shite!!!!
@15:47 that’s what I said, totally agree
It’s a hint slower to 200kph than an F1 car. F1 does it in about 5.5 seconds and this is 6.1.
Chapter 2 for Rimac should be a mass produce cars. As of right now, the major player in the cheaper mass production electric cars is Tesla. If you ask me, they should have already started on it. Because now should be the time to enter that market. Before all the major players starts going into it. But I think it is kind of late for them now. Most major companies are already starting to properly go in the electric car market.
9:45 It very lucky that they make his dad car engine have a limit or else he gonna break Lewis Hamilton track record in a slower machinery
No sé ni mierda de automóviles, pero soy muy fan de Mate Rimac , hi is amazing
damn the 'nooo, these guys don't feel sorry' really sounded deep ..
11:47 if you look at the steering wheel you can see nico's muscle memory as his fingers twitch to shift down even though there are no paddles
for my conspiracy theories friends, yes Nico has 14 cameras watching at him every second every time.
Amazing.. This is Prorper to drive. Awesome.
Mate, Christian, Gordon... Somw of the best and most humble people in the car industry are building somw of the most exciting mashinery the world has seen. Look how they manage their xompanies and how they 3 so well understand and know all the aspects of their technology! If only more industries had similar approach to their products and most importantly their teams!
Please take it to the track. I know it’s probably impossible. But if I could live vicariously through you taking it to the Nürburgring Nordschleife, that would be amazing. Helmet cam. Under 5 minute hot lap? Definitely sub 5:45.
i would have been like u can drift the whole road if u want mate
This is easily the most incredible piece of machinery I’ve ever seen. I watched both videos and I could not take my eyes off the screen. Gorgeous, scary fast, and the technological advancements are so impressive. BRAVO  How do I work for Nico Rosberg?
Your man is a bit of a drip I would be encouraging Nico to absolutely send it not every day you get to experience an f1 driver in a super car
I have no idea about Croatia, but Mate is such a cool guy that it makes you curious about Croatian culture. Great Video as well. 👍
Non hai mai battuto Hamilton in pista ricordalo
I'll wait for the Charger Banshee with 9/10 the power for 1/10 the cost next year.
Can we see the drift please!
Wonder what kinda meeting it'll be when Matte, Gordon Murray, Koniegsegg and Pagani are all present. Would be interesting. Would be very very interesting.
stay safe
Best video in a long time Nico!
When you will upload new video about Nevera?
Incredible car and excellent video.
What a Beautiful machine Nico!! Love it... Well done!!
Wow what a unbelievable amazing experience. to be able to see  my f1 hero with a smile on his face. Because he was treated so bad by people when he was up beating Lewis. And has never been able to show this side of him. I am disabled and having a chance to see u nico is just unbelievable thankyou so much for this. And for never allowing people to but u down. and then wining the f1 world title just to show who is the boss.
Hi Nico, where is your car that you bought two month ago ? You paid 2 million euros for nothing....You are stupid or liar ? Can you say us what is going ?
Homelanders dad?
Homelanders dad?
Incredible car!!
The fact that there’s a drift mode makes me like this car
Nico ;)
Felicitaciones Nico.!!! Desde México🇲🇽 un abrazo.
my mind is blown,  thanks Nico
That guy is a legend sounds like a very smart dude and good business man take care of employees and they will take care of your business. All power to him.
who won the secret giveaway???
Congratz Nico you got hold on a Awesome car 👍🏻🇫🇮
Loved Nico's honesty, and Mate's philosophy. Cool to see not a psychopath in charge for once. Don't ever change that!
It seems like Nico is so used to beautiful and expensive things that getting a hypercar is just another tuesday afternoon.. well, that's called being rich i quess
"I still haven't hit 100% throttle" - Not the words you expect to hear from an F1 WDC driving any road car. The performance must be on another planet.
Love that car
Nice car. Has that McLaren F1 look
Insane. How long does the power last? That was a quite long ride there...
one of the best car videos made, ever
Awesome to see you do these videos and your love to cars really shines trough.
Just don’t oversteer up a hill and do a flip and roll down and it catch fire for 5 days
I really appreciate the fact that Nico didnt sugarcoat his words or try to suck up to him or Mercedes. Very objective, not scared to say something wrong or pry too much like car journalists. Amazing video.
mich würde echt mal interessieren ob dieses Auto die Chance hat die 490 kmh von dem Bugatti zu schlagen
Da mal mitfahren 😲💪💪
7:45 "these guys don't feel sorry" Uff he meant that
Zombies and parroting lobbying ADVERTISING LOLOL GET OUT!!!
el nombre nevera le va genial ya que estas conduciendo un electrodomestico , en español nevera significa freezer
Why i fell that rosberg is a big as......le???
It was great to get to know the owner of this Rimac company a little better. Good and clever man 👍Greetings to Him
Duracell
Nico—this is so awesome and the lines are sleek. I love my Mini BUT no 3.5g’s!!!! Great video too.
So final verdicts.. it’s proper amazing and proper proper unbelievable
love mat reaction XD
BRAVO,  autant d'humilité,de valeurs et d'ouverture Ça met la banane de voir un jeune entrepreneur repousser les limites de sa passion de cette manière, merci Nico pour cette vidéo ! Repousser les G😉quand a la daily F1 ... Atomique ❤️
15:34 PLEASE SOMEONE PLS TELL ME WHAT SONG IS THIS ??????????? ITS IS SO NICEEE T.T
Mate is such an awesome guy! Nothing but the best for the man and the company! Congrats on this amazing machine Nico!
whats the music in the intro ?
Just loved how Nico was curious and honest about everything he has to ask , he's so down to earth. And dude the CEO! Why wouldn't you let him drift that beast!
At 4:21 “This is faster than a Bugatti Chiron.” Bullshit! The Chiron broke the 300 mph barrier back in August of 2019 ( 304.77 mph ). The Rimac only goes 256. Don't believe me, look it up
I'm pretty sure that the only reason the Rimac Nico has 2,000 hp is that they merged with Bugatti @Nico Rosberg
Lol, in sport mode and 2000hp, "This car has to much traction". Put's in track mode on a normal road 🙂
how many millions were you payed by rimac to be a spokesman for this car
rimac uvijek izgleda ko ukiseljeni zec
😂😂😂 You were scaring the shit out of Mate lmao
You know it is fast if Nico Rosberg is impressed.
Just don't let Hammond drive it
Stunning!
Then people say money doesn’t buy happiness I beg to differ
Try the Greek beast..."CHAOS"...!!
Like to see Max take it for a test drive
This guy will achieve much higher levels than ever Elon will.
One mans dream becomes another mans pleasure . Nico 001 and Mate Rimac . Sydney AUST ..
Him comparing an amazing racedriver testing a car with some random CTO that doesnt know anything about cars haha
Rimac Trotter 😄😀
You could tell how nervous the guy was but had to keep reminding himself that nico won an f1 championship and is an amazing driver.😝
its faster 1/4 mile , 8.7 vs 9.2 for a F1 car. Best  interview with mate so far.
Car has 17 cameras built in. Doesn't use them. They must not look great
0:14 "You have to get used to the car"  Like it was never Nico's job before to push a car to its limits for the first time or not. Laughing so hard at this.  And that silence 04:34 indicating an evil plan is coming up hahahaha my goodness
Mate reminds me of the other electric car genius, Elon Musk, but Mate more high performance focused.
Mate Rimac is the best CEO i could ever imagine. he did every step on his own and does see his employees as equal human beings. MAD RESPECT!!
GREAT car and conversation, two brilliant guys, thanks!
Nico you got to try it against an F1 car mate just to satisfy us all.
Having an F1 World Champion drive the car you made must feel pretty special.
*casually "this is 9 seconds to 300"
wild. Love it Nico.
This is a fantastic video, great conversation mixed with great driving, thank you Nico for the content.
Mate, what a guy.
Amazing
Svaka cast. Zelim ti srecu u svim tvojim planovima, mada sumnjam da ce ti trebti.
Talking about wrecking the car… „These guys dont feel sorry“ - Someone in the car
But its silent and dead soooo
Imagine you develop a hypercar and leave out 30% power in sport mode "because it's enough". Mate Rimac is really a great and very cool guy 🙂
I thought this car had cameras to record your driving video in order to not have GoPros to think about, but in this video they use GoPros anyway??
I want 5 of them. Nice job Nico
1400kw = 1900 hp btw
bravo MATE za ovaa fantasticna NEVERA golem pozz od Makedonija samo napred i na red e elektricni SUV coupe
😂❤️
Nordschleife when?
Amazingly, F1 cars are slower.😮 From 0-300 km/h an F1 car is less than 1 second behind the Nevera. Top speed reached by an F1 car is under 400 km/h, while the Nevera reaches 414 km/h
Imagine making the world's fastest production car and basically being afraid of driving 😂
Car has 14 cams  Nico: I want more
The car has something like 13 cameras build in so "you don't have to deal with installing gopros everywhere". Either they're not as good or they just wanted to use they usual workflow I guess.
Not with me in the car lol 🙃 😆 😂
Good job on the drift joke 👍
Unbelievable
So the car has 16 cameras but you still use the gopros..?:D
I love it! You are going to have so much fun driving it.
I get really good and honest vibes from Mate. He impresses me much more than say Elon Musk...
He voted GREEN!🥵🥶
His reaction to Nico wanting to push the car says a lot tbh. I get it it’s super powerful and you need to get used to it. But idk…it’s as if he knows things could go wrong idk man
Crazy.
14 integrated cameras and you still add two GoPros?
"We have integrated cameras so you don't have to worry about go pro's battery etc."  proceed to use go pros
София - Варна - 20 минути :D
On a completely different planet
Rimac Nevera Show!
These cars have about as much character as a dishwasher.
oh come on now, it's not like it was Richard Hammond driving.
"these guys dont feel sorry" 1000% true
One of the few fully electric cars that has really made me fall in love with it.
I'M just wondering are you doing left foot braking going up the hill?
I don't know about rimac sorry but sir Nico I'ma tell you. You didn't go wrong on buying one that car looks great overall I watched the full video. Plus the ceo is very humble. This car will be the future.
Nico: “Why would you not put more on sport?” Mate: “Because it’s more than enough.” 😂
Which song is that on 7:48
Why are you trying to humiliating other cars and companies in your both video it is just disgusting imo
F1 Retired  so great, so much money playing Super Car  Awesome Bro
Seems like a top bloke.
Hi Mate,I love your way of managing your company's staff, u Will go a long way in business, stay the cool boss it's good for business 👍👍👍👌
That looks Gorgeous the Black gives it that Stealthy but Classy look, What a Car Enjoy!!!
Man I watched it twice. Perfection.
If I had this car I would have sold it immediately, it's useless as a car, only to show off.
Glossed carbon fibre exterior with red trim details is an excellent choice.
24:03 If the car has multiple cameras so you have no need to add a go pro to the dash... why was a go pro added to the dash?
24:03 If the car has multiple cameras so you have no need to add a go pro to the dash... why did you add a go pro to the dash?
i really liked to see the reaction of Rimac himself while seating with the F1 Legend. The Face..hahaha 🤣 so funny...
Cool seeing a driver and designer talking so freely.  Very cool
A bit of podcasting was going on in this video. Thoroughly enjoyed this one. 😊
Super amazing car
wow this guy... you can't hate him even if you tried.
Gorgeous...
Drive it up pikes peak ASAP and preferably in the race! Then again being closer to the Nürburgring - do that first!
Covek se usro :D
Have fun with you crazy sick car nico we miss you in F1 bet your enjoying Verstappen's uprising and the downfall of Hamilton just as much as we Dutch do hahaha
My daughter , and hopefully not 😂
Mr. Rimac makes the most respectful point at around 20:50. He would rather make his employees wealthy than take advantage of them for his successes.   Pure champion.
Hey Nico, plz take your car to a @carwow drag race. A Nevera vs F1 vs Chiron drag race would be feast to the eyes!
Electric pfft.
Awesome stuff Senór Rosberg
It’s not that good looking
I like the way you took charge here. Nice work! :)
Lewis in the passenger's seat holding Nico's F1 Trophy.
Love the car!
Mate is the real Elon Musk !
I can’t get over Nico’s reflexes when he’s trying to shift Electric car 11:56
wow what an inspiring conversation and a fantastic car as well
Loved it…….Nico. Mate had done magnificent job with the car.  I think is the best super car.
A very nice Car ! But , You could play some better Music than what that Girl was singing !
❤️❤️👍👍 congratulations 🥳 nice car feel good when seen smile on his face 💕💕 God blessed you 🙏
"you know, this is my first job" :D
Sorry Sir but I think no sound no party.
I nisu stali u niti jednoj birtiji.Katastrofa.
Interesting conversation ❤️
🙂
I disagree about the carbon Nico! It looks bad A!
This video is great, one of the funniest videos I’ve ever seen. My first Nico Rosberg video and I’m a fan already!
I think Mate is the best type of CEO to have. Deeply connected to the product they build. Smart, modest and in contrast to some others… not a nutcase with an overblown ego trying to turn us into robots ;)
as long as nothing was made in China... I approve 100% ;)
21:39 "Higher than LaFerrari? Why?" Wow Nico's voice is thick with condescension. That"s his F1 driver is showing. Every mm of height on a car is worth a few hundredths of a second per-lap on an F1 circuit. Nico must be feeling short changed that his car could have been 3/10ths of a second faster with lower suspension.
17:35  "LaFerrari" Hot Take: I have never liked LaFerrari and I doubt I ever will, and the point made here is a big part of that. It's just incredibly difficult to drive fast. If you like the feeling of your life being constantly threatened then it's great, and I understand there is a great appeal to having a car that feels unhinged, but in my mind that places LaFerrari out of the "Hypercar" class and more into the "Muscle Car" class. Problem is everyone wants to compare it to real Hypercars and LaFerrari always looks bad in those comparisons.
I have to say Rimac makes the best looking EV to date (yes I prefer the Nevera over Evija).
Nico "banned from f1 paddock" Rosberg
I’m freaking dying of laughter… I’d love to have Nico driving me through some hills but this guy is turning 50 shades of green… 😂🤣😂
poor, poor Mate ahahahaha
hola hola, Nico es como un niño travieso con su nuevo juguete, su sonrisa pícara lo dice todo, super buen video muchachos. Rimac ahora es del grupo VW, cierto???. Creo que nunca tendré uno, mas que seguro que no, por economía, pero aún así, por saber conducirlo, ya me gustaría tener ese problema...., saludos coordiales.
I like how the car has 14 cameras but they still needed to install a GoPro
Wow, what a beautiful weapon 😊👍
Bruh 😂 That opening was awesome 😂
gutes video
most impressive I found to be the company mentality, that's building a different world and to me that seems to be in a good direction... many many blessings
If Mate is so nervous in the 001/150 with an F1 driver, I guess he won't get into the other 149 with normal customers 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This car is here is electric
Wow such an amazing beautiful car here at 2k BHP WOW
Massive complement to the whole team
From 12:56 onwards, it's clear that the GPS reception needs some improvements...
I love these 2 guys man
I think it's one of the best cars ever made  .
Pretty awesome first job.. I was flipping burgers at Hardee’s trying to save for a 1980 RX-7.
bloody amazing what a car there should be another name, not just a car!
Chapter 2, Mate leaves Rimac.
if you look at  the navigation screen from 12:56 you can see the map glitching but they will probably get that fixed with software updates, the Nevera looks amazing kudos to the whole team behind the car
If you want a car in carbon, you’re legit.
What a great guy this Mate is. wish you lots of luck with everything coming your way may allah bless you and guide you the right way
Funny how he messed with him
un bébé riche en extase!!!pfffff
This is an amazing video and i enjoyed every bit of it. And i'm also excited to share my investment experience this year. I believe it will help a lot of people here who are confused on how to startup theirs and be productive.
I can't even imagine happiness of driving this thing, congrats!
What a beautiful automobile!  The owner is in tune with what he wants to deliver and how to be a client-driven entity.  Great color as well.  Cheers from Florida!
Nico when will we see your unfiltered reaction to the Nevera? Can’t wait!!
The GPS needs some work to do.... just watch closely @13:00
Great video! Great car! And some great people!
Nice car, the Rimac Fridge
„These guys dont feel sorry“ thats the sad truth 🥶
What I like about Mate is that he clearly loves what they are doing. Buying a Rimac should doesn't feel like byuing a "normal" car, he knows everything about his car and the philosophy how he is descibing what they have want to achive with this car is amazing.  I would be proud working for such a company.
If you can’t put the power down, that’s a huge failure.
"these guys don't feel sorry"
It's a dream came true - making a supercar and having an F1 champion as your chauffeur.
How about a real drag race - Nevera VS F1 W07?
Nico's Mercedes R50 was not delivered yet, am I right?
Well I reached the end of the video, Nico, how could anyone possibly give your new car a thumbs down, it looks phenomenal, not just its appearance but of course it's performance too. I admit I have not been a follower of formula one, but always a lover of cars, and I knew your name as a formula one driver but wasn't aware you had a YouTube channel, I really enjoyed getting to witness your amazing new car reveal in your other video and definitely witnessing your first drive in it here. Congratulations on your new Rimac, 001 - 500 😊
What a masterpiece of a car, the performance, the beauty, the details, genuinely gave me goosebumps, a shame to feel the chance of me owning one is something like 0.2% but my chances of owning a Rimac in the future may hopefully increase if things get better in my life with lots of hard work 😀
The car Is absolutely beautiful !
Mclaren in front and i8 in back.
Rimac is and amazing young man 👍 big up , very smart and human
ZMM on the ASX. Good investment?
🤜🏻❤️🤛🏻
A good business model being completely transparent and a team of 300 is one huge family. Well done 👍🏻
Its just an electrified gran turismo who banged an i8
incredibile!!
Amazing!
This thing is gonna break down a lot
Wait, isn't he the guy who won the wdc against lewis hamilton in the same machinery 😮
NO, I LIKE TRACK MODE :) 5m30s
What a truly fun video, you're a natural Nico
I would love to see Nico do a lap on a real track with the hypercar.
Long trip-range test in most eco-mode, while reviewing the progress in EV technology by Rimac. Interior build quality impressions will be interesting topic. The first super-daily HyperCar?
It's still a pathetic battery car. Worthless trash
Only in the Balkan can you test drive a Rimac on residential roadways at x2 what the F1 carts do in Monaco on race day!  Long Live Croatia! 😛
Absolute power is.. never enough!!
I seen to episode now about the Rimax and the things I like most is he understand big bosses never says sorry they have a me/mine and know it all mentality and everyone that works for him is just valued.
Look beautiful and effortless to drive! Of course you are a professional.
Nico never crashed in his life, was always lewis crashing into him 🤣😂
Nico: I was almost fulled out. Driver of VW with tailgate open: Eat my grit!
Why didnt you choose a green one ?...
Hahaa, Mate: "Now we can switch back to Sports-Mode", Nico "No, no, I want to stay in the Track-Mode" 😂😂😂 Absolutely perfect car! Compliments to all of yours engineers. Nico, have fun driving it ;-)
Nico tripping on Mate is so fcking hilarious! 🤣🤣🤣
похож на Леонардо ДиКаприо
Mate has the right mentality as a boss. This is one of the things that made me admire him. Especially the parts where he says "if you are working for Rimac, it's because I trust you, I'm not going to micro-manage, you do your job" and more importantly "everyone at the company has a portion of shares" because that creates the feeling (very powerful feeling) that you are - part - of the team, really a part of it, not just a paid employee that receives the same either the company is doing good or doing bad. That is the type of mentality I admire a lot. Everyone is there to make the company succeed and everyone gains something from it beyond their salary.
Cool dude. Have sub. Great driver..
23:39 Station wagon with open boot effortlessly passes Nico...
Great video. I know the guy responsible for designing the Valkyrie chassis.
That's a big compliment to the whole team!!! How humble is this guy and his success.  God helps him to archive all his goals 🙏
This is the dawn of a new era.  The absence of engine sound will make media editors rethink sound effects for showcasing their material and content. I can’t wait to see you racing your respective cars, Nico in F1 and Mate in the Nevera on the the circuit de Monaco (race track.) I can imagine all sponsors being insurance companies.
you are very rich. can you pay me a superbike worth 10,000 dollars😁
How to make a supercar maker crapp his pants, drive it like an F1 Driver and act like your gonna drift a 2khp brand new car with him in it....exactly what an F1 driver just did. Lol.....  That was Awesome.
OMG, That is one beautifully looking and engineered car.  Dreams do come true.
Nico, what you have driven is the future of hipper cars into next 20~30 year's starting from now on.They will be faster, lighter and more maneuverability than is in present day's time. You will be able to change colors of your car depending of whether outside and car will read your mood and make some kinda recommendations for yourself and choose the best of your favorite option.
Did I just hear Nico diss AMG a little?  I wish someone would give hydrogen some love for our future
This was one of the best movies in the Predator saga. I absolutely loved the character Naru. She was strong, determined, smart, devoted, disciplined, brave - everything a great hunter/warrior needed to be. Yet, she was not inexplicably skilled, (unlike Rey, in "Star Wars: The Force Awakens.") We see Naru constantly training hard, making mistakes and learning from them. Audiences love to see the hero overcome crazy odds to defeat an immensely superior opponent. The final fight scene between Naru and the Predator had me cheering loudly for that tough little lady. She made me proud to be a human being. LOL Good movie!
I was waiting for Nico to drop it a gear lol
wow, this was great to watch!
Beautiful. I do see a Go-Pro, what happened?
I don't know fast you were traveling at 4:01, there's an ordinary car passing by you guys :)
Is the windscreen double glazing? If not I will not buy it
ZG 😷😂🤣🕛
Starting @12:57 the GPS can't keep up or can't track you well enough :D
Onko tuo koetaulu päällystetty vanhoilla mummon alushousuilla kun on noin kirjava.
Haha these guys don’t feel sorry….
Change the rims ASAP. Also funny how the car has internal cameras but they’re still using go pros lol
Most amazing supercar ever and the best CEO, such an inspiration, also about making everyone a shareholder 👌👏
Mate is fantastic guy with fantastic business philosophy, specially with his approach to his team. Of course, Niko is one of the best of all time and it puts special weigh and special meaning when he says "the car did what I wanted to do"! Congrats to both, very fine machine! And Niko, change your investment advisor :) Have a good one guys! Greetings from Serbia
i mean does ferrari ceo or of any other company sit with you in the same car? he has guts and that is to be respected.  everyone on high position would be scared going fast for they are set for life
Great
What an amazing car. A comment from such an amazing F1 champion is just marvelous.
"Thousand four hundred kilowatts"? LOL. Millenium Falcon suddenly feels inadequate space junk for beta males :)
I am so proud that this miracle is built in Croatia🔥
Nico the car is stunning ! Absolutely stunning.
Looks like a remake of a corvette
Mate is such a nice guy. He deserves all his success 😊
Its still a battery car...Duracell Bunny  🔥🔥...
"We go back to sport mode"  "No no I like track mode" "ₒₖ"
Is this the nico rosberg who raced for mercedes was you know driving and he beat the 7 time world champion lewis hamilton in equal machinery?
Next up is him making an F1 car when you test drive it
What we'd all like to know Nico, is how this would compare to current F1 cars on fast race tracks like Monza and Spa...with an F1 racer at the wheel of course! Comparable lap times..or Rimac would get creamed?
Absolutely nuts. Insane.
Functional art is so pragmatic. Looking forward to amazing iterations; this one is such a beauty.
The car is brilliant. And you were lucky your dad had a limiter in his F1 car.
wow,impressive
Svaka cast za napravljen auto,sto bi rekli kakva bolest ok kola,samo reci hvale imam ,bravo
isnt this the guy who beat 7x world champion Sir Lewis Hamilton with equal machinery in the 2016 season at Mercedes in Formula 1?
Incredible and very desirable.
Nico wie wärs mit einem Drag Race mit Lewis? Du im Nevera er in F1 Auto ^^
La macchina a Me non piace , mà la simpatia di stò ragazzo ti coinvolge nei suoi video .
What a Bullshit vid to see to guys speaking. I thought is about a car. Anyway in times of Inflation the best time to release super sport cars.
F1 cars weigh almost nothing so I’ll bet the F1 wins it.
THE BOY'S TOY, SO DAM COOL
Great video, love Nico and Rimac. Nico asks some strange questions at times though.
Visible carbon: Guy's an engineer. What did you expect? xD
Regenerative breaking is awesome. If I understand it correctly, it's basically breaking by creating magnetic force or breaking traction against the wheels, if not the entire engine. Correct me if I'm wrong.
"Everything OK?" "Pants are still dry!"
Croatia is _such_ a beautiful country! I want to go there just to drive! Anything! A tractor on the fields. I don't care! I just want to drive in Croatia! Much love from Norway! <3
C'est vraiment absurde. Le mec fabrique une voiture aux performances élevées dont personne n'a besoin sur une route publique, et quand en plus il se retrouver avec un pilote de formule 1 au volant, il n'ose même pas le laisser exploiter tout le potentiel de la voiture.   Bref, c''est inutile au regard de la réglementation de la route (à part en Allemagne) et on n'oserait même pas s'en servir avec un pilote expert. Le comble de la folie sous stéroïdes qui est en train de détruire notre planète.   Je ne sais plus quoi penser de cette société qui glisse de plus en plus rapidement vers le fond.
Rimac is the best EV car maker
I remember him saying that this car has 14 cameras! Why are there GO PRO'S in the car? 🤔🤪 Amazing car by the way !
Nico einfach krass sympathischer Mensch👌
This is my dream car. So jealous! I’d even settle for one in carbon fibre.
Awesome car!
He should be concentrating on driving.....not playing with his playstation screen.
Car is nice.  Kinda weird seeing the lifestyle of the rich and famous.  Interesting hindsight I'm sure.   Anyway, best of luck on your journey to experience great things.
et Nico tes vidéos tu pourrais pas les faire en français j y comprend pas un beignet en anglais merci ciao
Truly amazing technology and from what I see the car is sublime.  Rimac as a company from top to bottom as said 100% transparency. You won’t go wrong a total credit. 👏🏻
Insane
Hey Nico can you collaborate with Mullen Automotive? they are going to be huge in the future, you could show us some insight into their technology....
you gonna boink a lot of women with this car
wheres the pictures
LAST EPISODE: "there are 14 cameras installed so if you do fun stuff you dont have to put GOPROs everywhere way around you in the cockpit to film you, the car does it for you" THIS EPISODE: GOPROs everywhere attached inside and outside to film the fuin stuff...🤨
The car is quite simply so far technologically advanced to other marques that you wonder by the time they catch up Rimacs will then be going past in sky with nico drifting around clouds.
Everything looks ordinary
Amazing car 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Who is that nerd with so much fear?
Only driving in germany make sense.....full speed on our highways...
Car is fantastic and the company owner was down to earth he really gets on well with Nico. Very relaxed atmosphere. Mate also has great mindset that rewards all of his employees if the company is doing well what a great incentive.
Seems real similar to my 03 prius.
amazing.. happy for you
Nico always reminds me of Edward Cullen😳😂🙏🍾🍾🍾 Beautiful piece of machinery with 2 down to earth guys inside. I'd love to have a drink with you....Can we do a drift? No no no no 😂😂😂
I wonder if chapter 2 includes a new pikes peak run....
Is that nico rosgerg who beat lewis hamilton in equal machinery?…
Ayooooo croatian zagreb license plate from my country
Mate speachless "there was .... oooooh ... " lol great car great guys, congrats to the whole Rimac Team
Very Nico Love the machine the colour everting is just amazing drift mode ah❤️👍🏾😂
Hypersonicar
Mate hit that “let me tell you something, let me tell you something, LET ME TELL  SOMETHING”
rear view mirror not carbon fiber?:)
wait he sold 1% of his rimac shares and bought bugatti company?
Funny fact , "Nevera" means "refrigerator" in Spanish . 😄  That's one powerful and expensive fridge.
Why not put more power on sports? "Because it's more than enough"    says it all understated by Rimac! Can't Wait for chapter 2 !!
NICO: "Everything all right, Mate?" MATE: "Yisss"  Back at the office. MATE: "Team, we hypothesise the client experience will be enhanced by letting them drive off alone."
Mate is very clearly passionate about cars and the Rimac Nevera shows the attention to detail he puts into his passion. Especially when he started talking about the heat of the batteries versus the brakes and transferring between one or the other for optimal performance.
Pure magic
Awesome Nico. The ultimate shuttle piloted by the ultimate driver. I'm much like Mate: "I created it, you better take care of it, is that too much to ask?" Thanks for sharing your dream.
Its very humbling to see a creator of such an incredible piece of technology left slighlty nervous of his own creation! He’s clearly created driving perfection and you can hear that through one of the most impressive drivers of our generation! 👌
Very nice that they installed a brochure with your signature. I always see your father's brochure in my Opel Calibra.
pure garbage.....hahaha  Joe Booker of " Joe Cell " fame did twice that with NO gasoline of fuel at all....only air ( the REAL fuel ) and resonance ...
I’m an instant fan of this car. Video game levels of performance, the acceleration between corners looked impossibly fast, very impressive. The attitude Mate Rimac has towards the people that work in the company is beautiful, if I had skills that were worthy of this company I’d quit my job and make the move
Rosberg is a proper bloke talking to another person, not the camera.  Great stuff!
Blurring the speedometer so he doesnt lose licence, way to do it hahahah
Great
They could have made it more amazing in looks. Just seems so ordinary looking. It maybe the fastest production car but it’s doesn’t look it. It doesn’t have that wow factor like a Lamborghini does.
Хорошая машина , Нико! 💪👍✌️Поздравляю !
the bro with him in the car car owns the fastest electirc production car company and the fastest non electric production car company like huh?
the rimac owner dude is pure class. clearly very smart, very passionate, completely focused on his objectives
Very funny.
Says A lot when an F1 world champion is impressed and has a newbie smile .
I love everything about the car but the name, it literally means fridge in Spanish x)
Someone forgot to roll the forward-facing GoPro I see.  Bummer.
Looks awesome!
Dear Nico, someone wrote in your name that I have won a price, a F1 helmet, a Sony camera and a Mac notebook. Now they want the transport costs from me! Serious or a fake? Thanks for confirmation! Roger
Is this the same Nico Rosberg who won the 2016 WDC and is the only person to beat his teammate Lewis Hamilton in the same machinery?
I don't know Nico, apart from F1, and at the beginning of the video he was seeming arrogant to me... About halfway through the video, I see how he beats the co-driver (the co-driver is great, by the way) and the video almost does an interview with the engineer, more than him, and still entertaining...  The video must be seen in its entirety, an enjoyment.
Why teslas first front on a rimac? Can't understand this
ah, that was nice :D If I would talk about the power of the car, I'd say "1.4 Mega-Watt". Just to make sure, that we are now working in a new regime.
👏👍
This is what you call a Dream Car ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Mate se malo preplašio. 🤣
Best boss ever?
Just saying,nevera in Spanish means fridge.  Electric cars are electrodomestics, full circle.
Great car and great video! Mate Rimac is such an exquisite person. He is so simple and he tells things without hiding anything. looking forward to see how he will goes with the future car shipped to other clients, maybe some others, special like Nico.  Also looking forward to a proper drive by Niko on the race track to see the full potential of the car!
Maté’s expressions..... priceless! This was a good vLog Nico!
This is just two car guys having a blast with a car. Love it.
This is just INSANE! 👏👏👏
Brilliant 👏 👏
Masha Allah… 21:15 respect… thank you Nico for sharing your first ride… this has been my favourite ride along so far… masha Allah the Rimac looks amazing, if you have been that impressed with it I cannot think why anyone would find otherwise… masha Allah I trusted that you would win your last F1 season and I trust you with your choice of cars too… so I will keep joining your ride along’s on your channel… keep it up brother 😉
Epic video on every level!!!
Sound........ 🤔 Very fast... No emotion to see this.
Hey my friend. Do you know what Lexus car 🚙 IS #1 in the world 🌎. Engine last longer.
Maté relax - thats @nicorosberg at the wheel and not  @richardhammond 😂
Now that’s an awesome post..
Wish If I was the lucky guy in white car. Imagine... You are whitnessing F1 champion in the fastest car ever passing next to you with full throttle
That car is absolutely stunning!
¿Where can i find this music...? 1:58
When you manage to get an F1 world champion to giggle like a little kid while driving your car, you know you've built something special.
Nico „Sustainable“ Rosberg …
Nico I am 50 years old now but I definitely want your life when I grow up! 😁😜 All kidding aside; I really enjoy your channel and i’m thoroughly impressed with all of your work in the field of sustainability
An absolutely beautiful machine! Beautiful lines, incredible power, and unbelievable power. Good luck with your new super car.👍👍
Amazing!
Nico des vidéos en français s'il-vous-plaît. J'aimerais comprendre tes vidéos 🙏
Yeah. But where's the frunk? How's the luggage space?! And a tow bar?! ;-)
Man that is a piece of art. Amazing!
maan i lovely to see you guiz enjoying this car, love how mate is proud and love how nico appreciates the car :)
7:43 "These guys don't feel sorry" can't imagine the crap this guy has had to go through breaking into the luxury sports car market. Great to see that he seems quite down to earth
Start @7:40 *Truer/More Disappointing words have Never been spoken* @ 7:46  I s'pose it's something that I'll just never understand bc regardless if I was a Billionaire or a Dollaraire, *Respect is Respect!*
6:14 if you're looking for the full scene at the beginning of the video
"we can go back to sport mode" "NO I quite like track mode" ... We never would have guessed that
Dommage qu'il n'y ai pas une traduction en français car la discussion avait l'air très intéressante.
EVERYTHING changes in track mode even the suspension @Nico oh really? Wow.  Wtf is this? Hypercars for dummies?
The car is absolutely amazing. Favorite part is the rims. I love machined aluminum as well.
This was unexpectedly authentic. Mate appears to be a very humble, honest and focused man who has pretty much just gotten on top of the whole hypercar game out of his garage. Amazing stuff!
What a great and fascinating conversation between two very intelligent and interesting people . The car is pretty good too.
Wow! Just wow! Both videos were so much fun to watch. Incredible car, incredible company, I see a great friendship developing there! Congrats fellas!
Imagine being the owner hearing the guy who beat 7 time champion Lewis Hamilton in equal machinery say your car has great balance, handling and feels like a proper race car.
Nico, when do we see a video of you and Nevera on the track?
My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:   (1 John 2:1) - Repent. Jesus Christ is coming soon.
12:16 Because not every owner is going to be a former F1 world champion Nico...
Did Mate once talk about his collaboration with Monster Sport and Nobuhiro Tajima to build the E-Runner for their Pikes Peak attempt?
Stunning…
So beautiful lines but not in ordinary black !
Techwise a very impressive piece of machinery but I think the design doesn't quite match the hype. It's pretty, sure, but it could have been designed in 2005 or something. 🤔
I'd like to see a car give away. Put all your subscribers names in a hat and have a smoking hot model pull out a name and whoever wins gets the car and a date with the model.  You would instantly become a living legend of cool just think how awesome you would feel, a true living legend!
So refreshing to hear about business men who aren't motivated by greed and selfishness. 👍🏻👍🏻 Makes you feel that there actually is hope for the world.
I really like Mate. He is the good Elon 😀….
Richard Hammond disliked this video😐
It’s funny and interesting how you can see nicos fingers shifting even though there are no paddles
Mate's love of cars in general is very refreshing.
All my life I wanted to be a formula 1 driver the closest I ever got was driving a stock car at Talladega Alabama and it rained so I never got on a track
From 0 to 300 kmh in 8 seconds ??? Veyron needs 17'7 s Chiron needs 13'1 s
Man come back to F1 😢
Where is this ? It’s breathtakingly beautiful. Song name at 15:30?
23:31 Going from 70% to 100% power is actually 1.43 times more, hence 43% more power, not 30%. So in effect, it's almost one half more power of the current level.
That thing looks ridiculously rapid through the twisties
Mate is literally my neighbour, nice guy
If the CEO is scared of the car, I’d call that a success.
I guarantee the Rimac is faster 0-60mph but I bet the F1 car wins 60-130mph in a roll race which is what I would love to see.
Absolutely awesome automobile love would love to own one one day can't wait to see you and the car at the track
Can someone tell me what car zips by the rimac at 23:38??
Dave Angel for the rich bullshit.
I should have applied to be the cleaning lady.
The rear view mirror surely seems straight outta my grandma's car though 😅
Take the car on nurburgring so we can finally see what’s it capable to do!!!!
The smile and passion says it all. Making Croatia proud.
👌
Great video, appreciate the educational and candid conversation about business, resource management, and aesthetics.
Were the white cotton gloves to absorb all the terror sweat??
oh its great but pls dont make it fully carbon mate
12:55 Mate was to stunned to speak😭
Someone needs to chronicle Rimac's story in a book... And the Nevera, absolutely incredible in every way. I hope this car revolutionizes hypercar ownership by requiring nothing but tires and brakes... No 4-point oil changes!
This drift prank is for the ages!!! best joke ever watched it 20 times now and the tears keep rolling beautiful moment
Gorgeous!
Man. That car is SICK !!
Of course Nico asks if it accelerates faster than his F1 car lol
a piece of automotive ART! what a fantastic hyper supercar!!
Wow.. What a beauty
Cool car, what's the range?
He said he sold 1% of his company stock, is it traded publicly then?
Two very interesting guys, inspirational as well and very special and spectacular machine. Well done Nico and Mate
Awesome
I am impressed regarding the "temperature management for breaking" in the Nevera. When regen gets the battery too hot, breaking is shifted more to the disk brakes - keeping the total break power constant, so the driver doesnt notice the automatic electronic break power shifting. RIMAC is soooo far ahead - it is unbeliebable !!! Phantastic engineering, Mate !!!
Nice.
no drift ok ahahaha Thank u 4 the vdo man🤙
anyone know what company he was talking about in 6:53?
Nico, please drive a record laptime on the Nordschleife with the Nevera, PLEASE !
warte, it's not a problem :DDD
I mean... that type of reaction from an F1 champion says it all. Simply fantastic!
let me tell you something 🤣🤣
Great!
That car is pure engineering masterpiece. It's not easy to impress F1 champion.
Enjoyed this Nico 👏
Can it legally exceed the speed limit?
Nicoooo, take me in it please! :)
Great hypercar!  The only thing is the name of the model:  Nevera means 'fridge' in spanish :)   It should be called Rimac Whip
I don't like the design of the car...lacks class and it looks old already...but maybe must be like this to achiev the performance  CEO looks an amazing person and the feedback of Nico about the driving is impressive Great effort!
Nico  Please do what you said you would do, comeback for Vegas GP. Do it proper, get some seat time in an older car to get back into driving shape. Maybe Williams will continue to make progress, that would be a sweet reunion. Though it would be magic to see you in a front runner, we would just love to see you out there having fun. No pressure, just fun, but wouldn't be that surprised to see you impress with a strong weekend.   With F1 mandating that teams give young drivers a FP1, I wish they would go one step further and have teams field a third car one race a year for young drivers, and legends like yourself.  Cheers, Nico. Happy to see you enjoying life, and focusing on making our world a better place.
Nico choked up a little when Mate asked him about the last time he drove in F1, I think.
Wow that is a proper hairdressers car.
Hi Mate and Nico this all Great! I am a big fun of both of you!  But watching again and again this video I have noticed something wired... In 3:37-3:40 of the video when Nico das the left -girth on the steering wheel the bucket seat of Mate moves left -girth unexplainably too much! Like as it is unsecured and certainly not tide enough. I hope that my notice helped if it is right to solve this issue (if it is).  Mate continue the great work and Keep Walking! And Niko I love your way of telling things. I think you should have second career as a test driver and also as a presenter and great talker.
Koenigsegg is much more beautiful car in all ways!
The NEVERA looks unreal, and it seems that it drives that way too... It's just incredible.
I've never being in a car with a formula one driver, but trust me when I say this, I will love to ride along with Nico. Congratulations on your new toy and be carefull with it! I love everything there is about the Nevera! That is an amazing super car.
Let's do some drift ... on track :)
May be it would be a good idea to have an HUD system that can be programmed to show telemetry info on the windshield so that the driver doesn't keep looking at the center console & get distracted from looking at what's on the road in front..
10 Minuten Blablablablabla!     und sonst nichts.  ??    Merde!🥰😡👾
Nico is truly out here living his best life. I'm happy for you Nico and I still miss you in Formula 1. The Mercedes years with Valteri Bottas weren't the same when you left. Mercedes was so competitive and on the edge when you were fighting Lewis every weekend. Those were some entertaining years to watch in the sport. Great video and enjoy your new car!
Love the car Nico Congratulations on getting the Nevera. Looking forward to seeing more of it on this channel.
Mate Rimac is an amazing and inspiring dude! That is the kind of guy you want to be with and work for! So inspiring! <3
Wonderful film but where were the shots from the camera car?
shame its sounds like a ..  a nothing
Now they have to make another one.
21:08 what is going on with the car in front??
Congratulations to the Monaco based YouTuber for owning rimac
Angeber.
Really enjoyed that watched it 1.5 times ;-)
What a brilliant, cool and inspirational guy. I imagine the cleaning lady is very happy to work there.
Stunning! wow! Whats a great sounding company, such an inspiring story. The car looks incredible! Those wheels! all that carbon! amazing!
Amazing engineering.
Amazing ride.. but ugly rims..
Totally stupid who needs 2000 hp to go from one red light to another
RimaC heisst immer noch RimaC und NICHT RimaK. Im Kroatischen wird jeder Buchstabe so gesprochen wie er geschrieben wird und umgekehrt.
cool
Rimac Nevera...or just Rimac Storm both sounds great.
Who needs a flight with a car like that! 🤣
Fantastic car Nico 👍👍👍. Funny joke with the drift.
Starting with a elektric BMW E30 and having such a succes is AMAZING BIG RESPECT FOR HIM
12:32 the speed on the right side of the dash is suddenly blurred, going to fast? 😄
12:34 Haha. The additional screen was blurred but on the main one you can see the change from 99Kmph to 100 Kmph on those corners :O
If it isn't manual with a clutch I don't want it!! Not even for free
Great video
Really good car and really inspirational the Mate's vision!!
Are the windows open cause there is a lot of wind noise
Imagine if it was a muppet driving - Mate would have been saying his prayers!!  Those guttural noises Mate is making are hilarious - tells us just how hard Nico is pushing at times…and just think about that for a moment, Nico doesn’t really know much less than 100% commitment! This is good fun - thanks Nico and Mate! And as for what we think of your car? Bloody epic mate! All the best for you and your family, Nico
18:55 All future Bugattis we currently plan are gonna have a combustion engine
and what is the range? how long does it take to charge? electric cars are stupid.
Why using gopro, when car has so many cameras :D
interior is quite ordinary compare to other hyper cars
I think I got scammed by you Did you send Me prize
Than drift with 140km otherwise the wing is not effective :-)
„These guys don‘t feel sorry.“ …really tells a story.
Sweet Car Nico😎
👏
Obligatory Richard Hammond Comment "I think I'll pass, but thanks for asking!!!!"
Love the car! Love the chat. Could listen to you two talk as you drive around all day.
Mate secretly used Nico as uber driver...
Both you guys have great character / personalities.  What a pleasure.
It's so funny that Mate was looking nervous........I remember one of my first rides with a professional racecar driver and I think I was shaking a little even after we were done with the ride. Good that he cares so much about his employees and recognizes the dedication people make when they are also owners. Nice car.
Glückwunsch zum Auto. Sei dir gegönnt 😊
My only critique is that the Rimac Concept One was a visual masterpiece. Unfortunately, this Rimac Nevera is a generic looking hypercar, dare I say... a McLaren. Still, I love Mate Rimac. I know he's married but I'd marry him in a heartbeat. He seems like an incredible guy and down to earth too.
Classy car with two classy people in it. Mate seems to be such a humble and down to earth man although having achieved so much at a young age !!
Klimakiller 3.0
It should have a 5 point seat belt or something like it
What an amazing car!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Didn’t know uwas a F1 driver
Great Thank for You ! (Пасибки за коммент!)
First thing to do is replace those ugly chrome rims
Perfect spec. Love the black and polished.  So much better than these other people painting their cars purple and yellow, ect. like a clowns car.
He saw chapter 2 flashing right before his eyes a couple of time's
Subcribe. Hit the bell. Boom!
Ridiculous. Who cares about this IT cars? Petrol head, modern and classic V12, V8 and V6. Otherwise, just take an airplane and that will pass.
very cool but missing one major thing. Sound!  Maybe you could add a sound system to round out the package
its obvious with Mate's hesitation that he is fully aware of what the car is capable of.
Electric cars are more polluting to produce, to maintain and to dispose of. Dead Batteries will be a mega treat to the environment!!
This is nothing that other car companies couldn't do.
love u nico
❤️❤️❤️⚡️⚡️⚡️
Wow this guy is great, wanting to run the company like a co-op 💯💯wish my boss was like him
Would love for there to be a fuel cell hyper car
Nico, you owe Mate at least 5-6 years of his life back hahahaaha I can see the loss of life on Mate's face, like instantly hahahaahah - amazing video, amazing information covered by Mate!!!  Well done overall!!!
Great video Nico, great car and tech.   Only issue is being so quiet!
Nico from same tow like mate rimac and Im happy that you buy nevera I love this car and company I live in germany in freiburg If Is posible to meet you some day i know you have lot of question like this but you are good guy you are one of my favor F1 driver after ayrton senna and michael Schumacher
The gloves are off 😉👐
chibbon fiber
Nico: Make a couple of qualy laps at Monaco so we can see how far away from the F1 is the time done by this electric beast.
when an f1 Champion tells the creator i got this don worry xD
This is better than Tesla
tons of more batterys... nature says thx
I'd like a ride to the airport too ~aye NIco!
Privileg ist Privileg. Ich freue mich für dich. Bei so einem Anblick lacht  das Herz und macht  Freudensprünge.
Amazing... faster than free fall for first 9 seconds of acceleration almost until 300 km/h mark..it will probably be a record holder for number of license confiscated per car manufactured:-) Such admiration that this was done by my fellow citizens🏁🏁
🇭🇷
I don't like those so called geniuses like Musk or Jobs who treat people like garbage but I like Mr Rimac's management approach a lot. And I share his appreciation for Koenigsegg. Well done and all the best for the future!
Amazing Video Nico. Specially you and Mate talking about other Cars aswell. And Mates half silent "These guys don't feel sorry" -  when talking about the big CTO 😂
Be aware of Spam contacting you telling you, you have won prises.
barby drive,,, tray be  better
i want to see you drive it , like youy stole it!!!!!!!  no restrictions Nico!!!
Are they testing the car in a residential area? Thats a bit careless and definetly something I dont really like.
Hamilton is better driver then you. Silly guy,  won just 1 championship because merc blew the engine of nr 44 snd caught fire...... Fake
23:39 someone with their hood open taking a picture 😂
Even though i could never have one for it to impress Nico so much makes it my new dream car Great first drive record.
I love every bit of it.
Just only 2000 HP ? I think this car is trash 🤪
If you wanna be successful, you most take responsibility for your emotions, not place the blame on others. In addition to make you feel more guilty about your faults, pointing the finger at others will only serve to increase your sense of personal accountability. There's always a risk in every investment, yet people still invest and succeed. You most look outward if you wanna be successful in life.
7:45 Such a profound but true statement. They really dont feel sorry.  12:56 seems the navigation unit is still needs work. Kept changing direction and the path the car was on.  Whenever Nico asked why did you do it like this. the simple answer is 'not everyone is Nico Rosberg'
Matty looked at times like chapter two  might not get written .
Please do a video with your dad! First impressions.. 👌🏻
Car is just 🔥🤩
I've been following Mate's work for a long time. It's a nice story for our little Croatia. Nico also does a good advertisement for Croatia. You're both great. I can't wait for the campus to come with my family. Good luck Mate
Hello Again. 'Nico'. You driving the RIMAC NEVERV, Wow it looked like a brilliant experience. Regards. RichardA.
"these guys don´t feel sorry" uff moment
Must be the best CEO to work for !! (together with Mr. Koenigsegg:)
Keep that away from Richard Hammond
Why has the passenger screen been blurred?
Its just unbelivable, i never wanted a car so bad like the nevera  Makes me proud🇭🇷❤️
Mate being based a.f. "those guys don't feel sorry"
Richard hammond permanently scarred this guy
Amazing Fantastic Drool Worthy Car!  Thanks for the first look of the real deal!  Thanks Maté for "THE Perfect Car"!  When I win the lottery, this is the ONLY car I would even think about getting.  Amazing and beautiful and functional.  The best of all worlds.
Only Richard Hammond can drive this car
Absolutely mind boggling, amazing, perfect!!!
electric garbage
Thumbs down. Electric.....!
He thought Hammond was driving him.
Trebali ste u video ubaciti dionicu ceste od 10:00 minute nadalje da se vidi kak ide po raskopanoj cesti
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 zzzzz....
Wow, amazing car, amazing people
"Yes, without me in the car"
Danke fürs mitnehmen Nico!  Was für ein Traumwagen😎
Nico is so hard to like... his ways an arrogance are unheard of
Der größte Umweltschützer Deutschland?🤮 Läd er bestimmt mal Gretchen zur Testfahrt ein?
Fridays for Future Fanboy 🤮🤮🤮🖕🏻
Wünsche dir ganz viel Spaß mit damit 👍 liebe Grüße 🖖
Rimac didn't knew his car can do that 😁😁💪💪💪
4:00 9 Seconds to 300 kmh???? WAT
From the front, it looks like a softer version of a TVR Sagaris
Wow. This Supercar is quite something!!! Amazing!
"no,no,no" Nico:"ja,wadde"
damn, Mate Rimac seems like such a great guy. By the way, what an awesome car!
3:08 Nicos eyes flick at the overtaking car thinking “ I can have you mate “ 😎
There are certain people that are changing the future, people like Mate' Rimac and Christian V K are 2 of them. Super cool to listen to Mate' talk.
Nothing but love for those 3! Nico, Mate, Nevera! <3
Still a great guy that Mate fellow. And what a car. Awesome.
Amazing machine from an amazing company
Dok budem disao biti ću protiv elektrike ma kako ona izgledala privlačna za mlade.Mladi ! Razmislite šta stoji iza toga.
NIKO you are wack
Mate we need this in right hand drive!
Bwahahahaha what a cheeky sod
So a youtuber gets the first rimac ha. smh
Nice Car Nico
Nico: Mate you can trust me Alo Nico: So how do I drift in this?
Er sucht immer noch nach einem Auto, um schneller als lewis zu sein 😂
Why would you need downforce on the rears in driftmode?
Mate saw too many crash tests
It’s just a car nods
When a formula driver spits out so much money for the car, and when he has a smile like this while driving, when he is amazed every time he pushes the car, that's when you know how great the car is!
Unreal
That looked like such a great experience! Nico always seems so approachable and a nice guy.
07:38 "these Guys don't feel sorry" 🙂
whatever they do, dont let Richard Hammond drive this car
Brilliant - Love the car. Be safe!
komm mal mit dem auto zum zeller see
To me people buy fastest cars is to meet Satan faster. Money make u loose your head.
Dont ever let Richard Hammond anywhere near your car ... I worry when a guy says "To tell you the truth" when he is selling .
In 10 years this technology will be in KIA and Hyundai for a fraction of the cost.
racing seatbelts?
Schade das es keine Videos mehr auf Deutsch gibt 😕
How long until have to stop to charge battery?
Come watch me receive my multi million dollar car peasants, I’m rich and I need you to watch me , ha ha you’ll never have what I have, peasants
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh interesante
Beautifully said Nico. So refreshing to hear a buisness owner who cares, respects and trusts his employees. No substitute for passion when it comes to running a successful enterprise.
The car is amazing but the seats moves so much in the corners! Wonder if it feels weird inside? 11:40
Wonder if him and elon have chatted
$2.5 Million
Nico, make sure you get him some complimentary pull-ups on the next ride.  I can see all the tension building up in him. " You can do it when I get out of the car". "you have to get used to the car first" LOL
Wenn der Mercedes die Technik von Rimac hätte hätten wir das Auto was die Zukunft beschreibt! Rimac hat im Exterieur ein sehr Mclaren nahen job gemacht und es ist wirklich gut! Das Exterieur ist gewagt anders aber zu den anderen Herstellern nicht konkurrenzfähig was es aber mit der Technik und Performance wet macht!
what a life. cheers Nico
Nicco says we slide now?? HOLD ON!!!! cus we sliding NOOOOWWWW ...
the whole time he ins the car he pray nico not speeding crazily..haha
14:02 turn signal on: responsible driving
Next video Nevera vs F1 car 🏎 Mate feels confident to whip
Love it
Awesome car.
I'd rather have the Mercedes-Benz Amg one with f1 engine instead
"why would you not put more power in sports?"....." because its more than enough" hahahha
Hätte ich die Möglichkeiten, dann einen T2 Bus mit 140 PS Boxer/Bremsen/5-Gang aus einem 911 E
Now he has better machinery than lewis
Watching this just made me happy
I want to be Nico Rosberg
Hey Barbie, I don't care about ur cars.
When a Formula 1 driver is constatly amazed by a car, then it's a good car. Rimac and Tesla are making automotive history and I'm really happy we have Rimac of Europe representing this change as I've always been a little envious that Europe doesn't have a Tesla or a SpaceX. They are such great companies.
Amazing 😍😍😍😍😍
Yayyyyyyyyyyyy! Another toaster on wheels!!!!!
Feliz Dia do país 😊😘🍼
do you still own la ferrari ?
2000 hp is fkin overkill you don't need that much power in a road car 😂
Great video... my fav 'petrolhead' of the year.. thoroughly entertaining 👍👌👌👌
mate is such a genius and so humble guy... amazing works from him and all the staff.... very well done sir.. 🔥
rimac best of the best!
Looks old needs a facelift
Now we need Richard Hammond to crash it.
My guess is that it's faster than an F1 car from 0 to 100, slower from 100 to 200, faster from 200 to 300
I've heard a lot about this company and it seems unique. I Like Rimac.
mental
What recession?
Legend...😎
carwow fans hit the like button
Schönes Auto und auch sehr stark,  aber es gibt deutlich stärkere in Amerika mit Straßenzulassung, siehe Alpha oder Ugr
Is Mate hiring? I would work Mate anytime.
0:55 it would be cool if we got something like that for boss intro in new nfs
Everything about Rimac is a bullshit...not even one car on the road after how many years of production...Why?
Isn't that ain't the guy that beat 7x world champion lewis hamilton in equal machinery?
Insane car! Why is he wearing white gloves?
Its a different story when there's nothing to hold on to when G's are being produced... If lunch was just eaten it may have ended differently... Hope to see you on the track and run it though its different modes... maybe with telemetry?       Enjoy the ride!
Formula 1 world champion
If you go to min 12:25 and look to nico's right hand, u can see a small flick on his finger, i think he was trying to change gear like in an f1 car, that shows you how much training they have on their head
I so love this car. I hope to one day drive it. Damn it's such a incredible great piece of engineering and so much love in it. Hope i get to.
This one is a beast Nico u'll love it as we will, keep us posted how its purring on tarmac.
Epic car. Two epic guys. Epic conversation. Wish I could afford one (& meet Mr Rimac - sorry Nico 😜) great video 🇿🇦
Nico you should try drive a 1932 ford deuce coupe they are soo fun to drive... such a great piece of history.
Ich wünsche dir viel Spaß damit an der Steckdose, das Auto wird unter Volllast nicht lange fahren.
You could see shades of Richard driving off course in his eyes....   Nico NO!!    lol
That's the fastest and best looking glorified golf cart that I have ever seen.
This car is beatiful but will never, never in history, beat the scream of a v10
These guys dont feel sorry haha
9 sek to 300 absurd numbers lol
Spectacular, thanks!  Loved the range of topics, too.
Omg those cars are just a fantasy u can  just own in games and I don't even have a car or license 🙃
I don't give a flying duck about your car dude. You are just a distraction for the masses, while we are all being robbed by the satanic cabal in power..
Nico,you drove through Bedekovčina town. I literally live there omg
That was amazing to watch
6:14 "Can we do a drift?!" ahahahahha
Legal o not legal 🤣
Such a good thing that climate change doesn’t seem to concern you. Let others suffer a bad pay the price for the ignorance of people like you.
Question - Do followers of Rosberg REALLY need an arrow pointing to the car in the thumb nail?   🤔
If Bugatti have Mate on board he must be really impressive with what he can see for Bugatti future
These guys don’t feel sorry!
@andrewtate
Loved the ending!
If I were rimacs owner I'd let him drift it. Go for it nico!
awesome
Never seen a car go so fast unreal 👌
Nico looked like The Homelander laughing at his misdeeds.
Wow, amazing car, and sooo pretty :)
👍
It’s on my Christmas list
Nico is part of the ~0.00000000065% of people, who as ever lived in this world, that can actually drive this car. Give him a break.   PS: i did do the math on that one
11:55 - Rimac trying hard not to look scared.
Nico doing nico things. Such a joy to watch
i feel for him is was sheeting bricks. lol
This car alone makes electric hypercars exciting. The attention to detail is impeccable and it makes incredible performance accessible. What a motor vehicle!
Cro-Power!
The Navi doesn't check where you are in the Mountain 😂
The best car companies out there and it only cause it ran by Mate. Great example of coming from noting.
Hahaha, from 17:27 to 18:07 Nico Rosberg passing with Rimac Nevera through my small home village (Kašina) near Zagreb. Next time come to wine or beer ... also near that place in 17:30 is living one of Rimac company employee.
Croatian Magic =]
is that th guy who beat Lewis Hamilton in equally machine in 2016
👍👍👍. La ferrari best.
Mate Rimac is a class act. Smart, polite and always on it. As is Nico of course.
9 seconds to 300???????????????
Neko kao Mate se ne radja često,za učinjeno do sad veliki naklon.
Having an F1 driver appraise your very 1st car off the production line 😂….Making Nico smile so much with his background in an EV is impressive!
Congrats Nico... Is a stunning car!
"Why not more power (on sports mode)" Mate: "because its enough" That's confidence 👏
Let me tell you something...let me tell you something ...LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING  !!!
pricks with money
Absolute class and very very smart owner 👍🏻
Amazing car,amazing combo,you are realy lucky,congrats!!!
At 14 years old it was a dream of mine to engineer an electric hypercar. It’s incredible to see this !
Its brilliant how Mate explains the shift of braking types from disc to battery and vice versa, makes its a smart hypercar. Awesome!
A podcast with mate rimac would be nice
Finally, chrome rims on a black car. How it should be. Absolute gorgeous car.
Amazing conversation - truly enjoyed it...two smart petrol/hybrid-heads
Nevera or Jesko. Wich do I choose. Both??
Nice story Of al time
I don't know about the car, but the conversation it's gold.
Sweet classic vw beetle 👌🏽
7:40 Strong Declaration... "This guy's don't say sorry" 😳
There are just some people that radiate a genius aura around them and every time they speak, that's Mate
show more of the road view next time please
Nico is such a cool fun guy. living out every mans dreams as part of his daily life. id love to see you drive/review the AMG one!!! and compare to your Rimac
der spiegel in der mitte, sieht aus wie ein einfacher opel corsa  :D
Would like to see what this car can do on the Nürburgring.
Such a cool song at the end of the video
Ччет даже язык не поворачивается назвать это гейкаром🤷‍♂️ Поздравления Бритни!
everything is okey, except BACK & naming + steering wheel design.
Combination between cinematic hypercar and backsound. Fantastic
First job: CEO and Founder of a hypercar company Second job: CEO of Bugatti
Nevera in Spanish: Refrigerator 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
The Rimac guy should possibly consider drinking less of his own bathwater.
Супер !
Wao! Amazing car. Congratulations.
You know it is powerful because your natural finger motion. Downshifting in and up shifting out of corners
The amount of tech in this car is incredible. Would love to see how it performs in the long run.
Beautiful car, Nico.
I like the way they was talking like any normal people   people understand what I m trying to said and what he is doing with the employees when people start this way it bacame something big
We would love to see this in the United States.
Mate is having flashbacks
23:38 that car has an insane rear wing for downforce!
I wanna see it drifting every corner on the limit. And a drag with that winning moto GP. Nice honest chat, we miss this....and btw, if I catch you in the city I will still bet on me and my little car. :)
NICE CAR !
This car is ridiculous. Ridiculous. You can see your excitement Nico! Awesome 👌 first drive Nico! Enjoy your new road rocket!
Great video 📸
4 point seatbelts is needed
Curious to notice how an ex F1 driver used to the latest F1 cars (and so used to left foot braking) is seen here right foot braking on this car. One would think with two pedals only he would left foot brake. Maybe pedal placement/setup and/or lack of confidence in doing so on road cars (for whatever reason) or this being a new car to him. Maybe Nico is used to right foot brake on all his other road cars and he always did so - who knows.  And one does need tip top foot placement/action on the pedals do drive this car fast, the aceleration is insane on it. One mistake and the car goes off road.  Curious indeed.  Nice video. I´m not very fond of electric for power trains, but this car is just insane indeed.
Venom F5 looks way better, this is without personality
Mate’s reaction makes the Nevera look like the best rollercoaster experience you could get out of a car
I will add Fake Sound F1, GT, or Race, Normal car.... Will be so amazing :D to hear it to. Mate its your next upgrade for fans, i think buyer will love it to :D
I would love to be a passenger, but only if Richard Hammond is driving.
Best car.
Rimac adhering to marxist power structural ideology was a true surprise of the most positive as of yet.
I love how Mate is scared of his own car 😂😂
Mate is the thinking man's Musk. More power to you mate.
Diinnnngue !!! On veut en voir plus Nico !!! Une version circuit ?
Im sorry but I don’t get any emotions viewing this Video it’s almost boring, I know it’s a different thing driving it but the car need more drama and sound
If you fear a f1 driver won’t control the car, then you have succeed.
Nico is obviously having a blast. . . but it can't be easy being the passenger 8-)
Knowing the superiority of an electric motor and still going for a hybrid with Bugatti is inconceivable.
Amazing video! Thanks Nico.
Batteries Not Included.
I really appreciate Maté's approach to his business and the way he treats his employees.  Also, that Nevera is beautiful, but I would go with a dark, metallic purple.
Je t'en supplie fais une Chine françaises Nico 🙇🙇
Absolutely amazing
Huge understeer on some corners
Needs more cowbell.
Speachless Nico! Congrats to you and to Mate for the amazing job done. A dream car!!!!
Good to see a world champion driver excited about a road car. Calling it a proper race car and then being able to drive comfortably through town or talk casually in normal voice is remarkable.
I think in equal machinery same like this nico will be still faster than lewsi
Loved the part about Rimac's employees being paid with shares ! that's a 21st century kind of company.  It involves your employees fully into the company's success, and they will be rewarded too for it.
Might be insane but in video you don't feel anything... No engine sound, not much pleasure
Love that car! And the whole story with Mate, he seems to be a really amazing person! If I ever get a bucket load of money I'm getting one of those! 😂 Great to see both of your reactions to the handling and performance 😀
Rimac is very charismatic guy,seems like a very gunny and smart guy. Also Nevera is my favorite car and most likley its one in the milion.Tell me one car which will give you all possibilities which this car has. Acceleration from 0 to 100,200 or 300,but not only that acceleration till you are in movement is amazing,it really gives you feeling of power just by watching. This guy right here made evolution of electric car by showing how cool and powerful they could be,I never liked electric cars cause of their sound,but this thing sound like nuclear generator when it accelerate in sport mode,absolutley amazing. I can't even imagine how does Rimac feels after knowing what he done and that he was most likley a guy who make milions of people start liking electric cars and broke that ice that no car company could.
slick piece of kit.  what a guy. level, pleasant, nice dude.
Lažibrada
Mooiste auto die ik ooit gezien heb hier word je echt blij van. 👍
next time can someone please put a heart rate monitor on Mate? throw him in the passenger seat again when Nico does a hot lap in Monaco?
Congrats Nico, congrats Mate. Beautiful Car! 🙏🙏🙏
Amazing $led Nico
My personal opinion about this is it's going to change the way manufacturers building their versions of hypercars. But deep inside me I feel the amount of power in this car is a bit too dangerous for anyone and everyone can afford it.  Especially people with so much money but little driving experience, by driving this car there could be a lot more fatal accidents.   Financially, it doesn't make sense to limit selling this car to racing drivers only, but I feel this car needs a lot of self-control, knowing the limit, and experience in motorsport to be driven.
This is one of the best first drive video 👍👍👍!
Nico, what do you think of the Delage D12? Right up your alley, I figure you are the best person to ask. It looks like everything the AMG One should have been, but that's a lamens opinion.
What it's this?  Gloves for enter in this car? But it's drive in small garage where be others car... Open the trottle Champion!! 🚀
Is the Devel Sixteen (Top speed: 347 mph / 550 kph 0-60 mph: 1.8 seconds) ever going to be reality?   And it seems to me that Nevera is more refined and composed.
hmm its okey but not special
Only Nico would coin terms like "proper unbelievable." 😉
Love it!
Great conversation too!
Wait is that Nico BOSSberg the man who won .....
Its beautiful Nico congratulations hope you have a lot of fun in it. Not so sure Mate will sit with you again though lol
23:40 guy with WV Golf races them on the highway with an open trunk... Welcome to Balkan Car is perfect btw!!!
Amazing car❤️❤️
It feels weird to have a car be so fast and so quiet at the same time
Nico,tolles Auto,optisch aber sehr Ferrari ähnlich,a bisserl langweilig optisch gesehen,aber technisch Weltklasse,und die Hauptsache ist ja das es dir gefällt.
So his amg one is going to be red ? :)
That’s going to be useful with speed limiters being introduced now for all cars in Europe 😂👍
Hennesy venom  f5 beats this car eazy 1850 horsepower 1350 kilo
Really good to hear a great approach to company structure and engagement, this will lead to a better level of production and really push the quality and technology.
Maté is the human being Elon could’ve been.
I think the car looks incredible. The attention to detail and the effort taken to make the car in house as much as possible is great. I'm a fan of Mate and im super into the idea of including everyone at all levels into the success of the company.
THANK you prossionnal driver joyfull kind man This a shin retour trip then I enjoy as you dis all along this vidéo. 👍👏👏
he’s an f1?driver   I would trust him doing anything
beautiful car, lovely v12 sound
It's going to be good watching what they do with the Bugatti brand. Great video Nico. 👍✌️🇬🇧❤️🇵🇭☮️
Nico is warming up tyres lol 😂
11:42 Rimac having Hammond flashbacks.
This beat the $130k Models S plaid by a pinch in the quarter mile.
najs
Is that Nico Rosberg - guy who beat lewis hamilton in 2016 in equal machinery?!?
So the big question........ Are you gonna take it out to the Nordschleife?  Or a rally stage with it in Monaco?  Also how are the brakes compared to a F1 car?   Like usual awesome video`s mate, and have fun with your new toy !
Over priced vs a Roadster. By $2.3 million.
amazing
Love it!
great that you got to have a monaco outing with your dad very very special! This car is nice but the style of the car doesnt really give me a hard on, i personally feel the Koenigsegg is better styling, ok this car is fast and has 2000HP but really how fast do you want to go, but its still no doubt a good car i guess it comes down to personal taste at the end of the day!
Na klar, in Zeiten des Klimaschutzes mit gutem Beispiel voran gehen Herr Rosberg. Sind 2000 PS noch Zeitgemäss?
This is awesome content Nico! Mate Rimac seems like such a down to Earth dude considering he builds crazy hypercars and EV's
mirror protocol
”Thermally limited”. Arctic winter would beg the differ 😏
A saw Mate and the concept one at an event downtown Zurich years ago with the pioneers of electro mobility and I know his first electric BMW, but the actual car is just amazing. Unfortunately I am not Nico at the steering wheel. I am proud however that I judged Mate right and to see what a young men has accomplished. I am also happy that they cooperate with Porsche and Hyundai Group. So it makes me feel good in my Kia EV6! 😎😍
Why black interior in the heat? Talk about draining the battery on AC after having parked it😏
Nico, your driving videos are some of my favorites champ! We need to get you to TX2k!
These two look like they BBQ together on the weekends sipping on a beer and standing over a grill!!!!
Scrap ! Ain't electric
@Mate Rimac, @Nico Rosberg, why didn't you use integrated car cameras, instead of GoPro?
Nico is Good, very Good, the same Mate, but personally useless car, can be the fastest (2000hp.....for what??? It is a truck? Faster than F1 in normal streets daes not make sense). No emotion for exeterior design, no emotion for the interiors.....the same for the engine. Im sorry Nico
Very nice👌
Küss die zeh ya manyak
I love the (company) Rimac soo much and Mate seems like such a cool guy, happy they've been able to make this car a reality, are trying to making Bugatti the best its ever been and are helping soo many other companies as well.
Cool, Nico. Ein Rimac ist sicher klasse 👍🏽
All the shots are from it’s own cameras right?
Matte seems like a nice dude. Proper engineer
Bruh show the road more instead of your face
I was there in Monaco in 2018. That was very special! And now you're driving this car. Isn't life good?
Wow I thoroughly enjoyed this video.
Looks like i8 from back
Was los? Deutsche Bahn nicht mehr gut?War doch so toll im ICE zu fahren:):) Jedenfalls der Werbung nach.
1:43 ''YOU KNOW WITHOUT THESE CAMERAS I WOULDNT BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THERE'' hes a world champion and cant even use mirrors correctly
Nice Coil Cyclone 2
What a boring car
very cheap seat belt 😳💩🙀
"Because it's more than enough" - This!. Much respect to them both
Mighty! 💪
Your videos are too bloody long!
S obzirom da tvrtka proizvođač ovoga automobila dobiva subvencije iz fondova EU kao i subvencije Vlade RH kao poreznog obveznika RH i građana EU zanima me kolika je cijena plaćena za taj kupljeni automobil?
Car Wow set it up, Congrats again Nico
Just buy a skoda
Hmm a tudor garage
Nico is good, very good, the same Mate, but im sorry about the car, can be the fastest .....but no emotions for me, (design, interior and engine). Im sorry Nico
i can tell his hands and fingers are not comfortable with the placement on the spokes of the steering wheel because you can see him go to grip the wheel where we all would but cant wrap his fingers all the way around the wheel cause the spokes are in the way so he has to keep re gripping after realizing the wheel sucks!
Mate Rimac is a genius
The monemt when he toggled the track mode.....🤣🤣🤣🤣
More than anything else I absolutely love Mate's views on leadership and management. Honestly no wonder Rimac has gone so far in such a small amount of time. Wishing them all the success
i like too see that you beat lewis on a f1 track....Remac vs lewis in a f1 car,,,  sorry  ...LOL....Nico wins
Most powerful vacuum on wheels
Without the camera's ud be stcuk? Haha thats a lie n a half after driving f1 cars with poor visibility, doesnt sound like a proper race car, 2000 hp of boredom, our future is looking unless 0 to 60 is all u care about.
So you teling me rosberg was near where i work and i didnt know? Im so dissapointed in myself
Maté has a great attitude
Nice choice man, RESPECT FOR BOTH OF YOU GUYS! Greetings from Bosnia.
Please Nico we need more Car content. 1 Video a Week would be so nice
7:39 Nico about the CEO who crashed their car -- "Its a good thing when you're trying to get money because they'll feel sorry";  Mate: "hahaha... these guys don't feel sorry" :D
It's not that fun watching you but you taking the lord's name in vain is not tolerable.
Mate is one of the nicest guys leading a company!
Just a work of art and soul. Love you making him uncomfortable in the beginning. By the end he was settled in and talking big vision 2.0. Looks like we have a winner!
So cool to see and hear you guys together in that unbelievable car!!!  Congrats to Nico for the great choice and to Mate for building such an amazing Hypercar!!!
Nico we need to see this car proper drifting 🙂
This guy built a car that makes him nervous on the road when driven by a Formula 1 champion 🤔
This is an electric Jet 😃
Nothing shows the difference in the level of driving ability then Maté and Nico's faces. Maté shitting himself while Nico looks like he is on a casual Sunday afternoon drive. Guess that is why Nico is a F1 champion. Total respect but to Nico when he goes "I don't understand" about the over heating. He so could have just passed over that but has a thirst for knowledge and wanted Maté to explain it. Love the work from both Maté and Nico
What is sad is that watching these videos, as a spectator, you can’t even get a tiny bit of feeling as you get for ICE cars. I have a Tesla so I can understand what he might feel but watching it…so boring
Wow.  I'd love to work for this guy!  He's got such a great vision!  Tremendous car, tremendous technology, incredible future!
Does anyone know what Nevera means (FRIDGE)
I love this conversation - thank you!!!
Clearly his scared…haha!!!
Man what an amazing machine! True art! I loved how scared Mate was when you went into drift mode :D
He said it best “no, these guys don’t feel sorry” lol
You shouldn't show GPS on the NAV since it really works awfull and you're trying to promote the car. 12:56
Lass mal JP ein paar Runden auf der LaSiSe fahren :D
Left the car at the airport??!!
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
I loved this video right up to the point when Mate was discussing his collaboration with other manufacturers and he indicated the exciting work being carried out and his quote about working on autonomous cars for the "ordinary " people and all that did was piss me right off, we car enthusiasts don't want to be forced out of our cars and driven around in autonomous boxes whilst the rich can drive around in their 2 million pound cars.
WOW!!!
Big thumbs up for all the straight from heart honest words on both different cars and business management and such. You both seemed to have a thrilling time making this video. Sharing this with the world brings it forward! Loved it!
F1 drivers are a different breed.
I drive a Honda Prelude 4WS 1989 and truthfully it puts a smile on my face just accelerating and dropping gears probably as big a smile as Nico has with his Rimac
Love the straight talking banter between them both.
Stunning car and absolutely brilliant video. Thank you!
Thanks for the GIANT ARROW in the thumbnail, I wouldn’t have figured that one out. That aside, epic car mate, congrats
Well a lap around  " The Monaco F1 Track ) at some stage with u , Nico wringing the neck out of this Beast without destroying it .  Reason 4 my request.  2 see how close it is 2 an F1 Car
Mate u fazonu, nemoj ga samo sada slupat, vozi ga kući pa ga tamo ćeraj kako hoćeš. :)
Make more videos with Nevera😍😍
the poor bloke was shitting himself.... good video nico and mat'e.
Park it next to an FD RX-7 🙂
One of these WEF puppets has got a new car and tomorrow he will preach about climate change again. Asking people to ride a bicycle instead. F.U.
Mate is a legend!
congrats nico, the car is for sure almost 10\10 Just 1 thing i saw is " yaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh need some touch for sure " the gps making crazy things ? that gps need big upgrade for sure
Muito bom, parabéns pelo vídeo, saudades de vc na pista de F1.
The other side of the story: PP on car registration plate propably means means "placeno porezom", or "financed by tax payers" as Rimac is biggest receiver of government grants, tax deductions and fiscal benefits in Croatia. So poor and middle class tax payers are financing production of toys for super-rich people. Great job Croatia. No wonder 10% of it's citizens left Croatia in last decade.
You can see Mate is so down to earth and open just like what he preach.
"These guys dont feel sorry" brutal🤣
"These guys don't feel sorry"
Beautiful car, Mate. It's had been so cool watching the development. Cannot wait for chapter 2. If you're ever hiring in the US...
Bezveze
Was man als youtuber alles erreichen kann
Hoping to meet and talk to Mate at Monterey Car Week 2022. This was a great video Nico, congrats on your new Nevera!
As a European I feel hopeful and a little bit proud when I se movie’s with Mate or Christian Von Koenigsegg. Startups with excellent, world leading technology and run by down to earth people without the typical corporate bs that American company leaders often has. Keep up the good work 👏👏
2150 kg…prova fare un giro in pista 😂😂😂
Unbestreitbar eine tolle Performance. Aber leider sieht er von vorn wie eine Mischung aus Corvette und McLaren aus und von hinten wie ein i8. Da fehlt mir die eigene Handschrift.
love how you talk about differnet cars and what you like and what not...maybe not our ( viewers) price range of cars but beside that it sounds like a normal talk between car nerds
Gordon Murray T50 anytime
"put it back in sport mode" "no, I like track mode"
EV vehicle’s 👎
Great natural and informative chat you guys did....
Rimac....the tesla killer...thank u Mate
Love how Mate is freaking out 😂
Top content 👍🏾. Well done Nico, keep on going.
The lap with your dad at Monaco must have been epic! I got to work with my dad shortly aswell, I'll hold that memory forever.
Too good 👍  It's a wooooow I love that car  Neveraaaaa
pffffffffff wauw nice drive
Congrats on your new car. It rocks!
11:20 autonomous driving, imo let Apple and other infinite money companies deal with that and make cool electric cars?
I would love to see you going with your car to a child hospital and giving kids, who are seriously ill, a ride. Put them a smile on the face and offer an unforgettable moment to them. This would be awesome. Thank you.
This is EXTREMELY high praise coming from an F1 Driver behind the wheel of a streetcar! However, I have to admit, that I just can't shake the feeling that there must be a business relationship here (between Nico and Rimac)? Excellent video none the less; thank you so much for sharing it! I had no idea that Rimac was involved in the development of so many huge, upcoming and current, hypercars!? That convo was a real treat!
The world needs more people like Mate.
Mate is thinking I don't care if you are  Ayrton Senna, Schumacher, or Hamilton all in one, you aren't going to place my life in jeopardy, I'm only young and I have many more billions to make before I die.
funny thing it looks like a corvert
Fantastic，it‘s the stander of ev super car in my opinion，built around people not just numbers on paper
That's one amazing car
Whilst it's awesome, I'm not sure I agree with driving like that on public roads....
12:56 Look at the navigation screen.
You need to do more track videos . Hot Laps !
Beeindruckendes Fahrzeug, aber ohne Sound sind diese Art Autos Nichts.
Pointless in today’s world!
Why is this different then any Tesla for example? Only price as I can see, and this car is not usable at all.
That looks to be an amazing car. Looks great, seems to handle really well and needless to say with an equivalent of 2,000hp and all the low down torque of electric motors I can't even imagine how well that accelerates - and I ride a BMW S1000RR that does 0 to 60 in about 2.7 seconds. Of course, maybe not as quick as Nico's old F1 car but it's no slouch!  The future may not be totally electric when it comes to cars because one technology may not fit all situations but it's hard to argue against a car like this. It would be a dream to see someone like Nico drive this back to back against something like the Gordon Murray T50 or T50s.  Stunning, absolutely amazing. Thanks for the video.
"These guys don't feel sorry" 😅
Pure mega
I love the car and unashamedly it shares styling cues with  McLaren no doubts. I could feel the torque through my screen lol and your smile is genuine so it must be impressive of course. Congratulations on a great pic regarding colour and trim what more could you want.. I don't think noisy colour trim is wise in a 1400 kW monster....one needs all the concentration without distraction lol 😆  👍
The Rimac is the fastest drag racing car Carwow has tested out of everything.
Salo was with mate a long time ago
Wonderful video to watch on saturday morning, having a coffy.
It is so important to get insights to hypercars the good and the bad, and not just the hype.
That arrow in the thumbnail is so pointless
Mate is sounding like a socialist and I approve.
2000 hp for what??? 😂
So mutch blubber blubber bla bla...  what a Worst case Szenario ...
You must turn off AC for max power??? Oh wait, you cant drive with your AC on if you want to have range to come back.
9 seconds to 300. …. Ciao Kakao. 🤣
Amazing looking car just don’t ever let Richard Hammond drive it.
Awesome. And what’s more awesome is what this company did in Croatia. Mate, you’re great. Thanks Nico for sharing with us and for your great skills. Mate, your conception of a company is simply amazing 👍🏻 if more owners thought like you, the job world would be a better environment
Nico the only F1 driver in 8 years to beat Lewis Hamilton. This year will finally be more people. But after 6 years. Nico is a great driver and I wish he didn’t quit.
Just what you want to see when we can't pay our energy bills ! 😁
U can see nicko voing for the paddle shifters every time he pushed the car LOL
Monaco hattrick? ”My daughters? Hopefully not.” 😂
This is such a entertaining video for me. Seeing mate's face when niko was pushing the car on the mountain roads. Definitely a like for me!
Solid color and great looking rims. Overall a great combination and congratulations to you Nico. Enjoy the ride..
💯✔️
Boooooring change angles more
Wow.
Amazing video! Well done Nico 🔥
This is such a great success story,…
Very nice, Nico. Greetings from Croatia 🇭🇷
Hubraum ist durch nicht's zu ersetzen außer noch mehr Hubraum! Elektro Autos sind Scam von der Welt Elite.
Since you first announced your purchase, I have been excited like a child to see you drive this thing. It's my dream sports car but I doubt I'd ever be able to sit in one. I'm so happy to see that you enjoy it so far, and look forward to seeing you share some of your most fun drives with us!
"Why is there so much traction control in sport?" He doesn't answer because he doesn't want to hurt his clients feelings. He would probably say "Because most of my clients are rich not racers"
He thinks that his car can beat an F1 car. Maybe he should go up against the W11 since thats good representation of a now days F1 car
he’s scared for his life 😂
This guy is cool in everything,I call him a super guy
Matte freaking out reminds me of Ford v.s. Ferrari movie when Ford’s CEO got in the car with Matt Damon and almost 💩 his pants.
Gorgeous car , and sounds like an amazing drive. Very nice to see an actual leader running a big company, not a YES man Good on you Mate.
The car is incredible!   Hilarious how you had him 'gulping air' at times when you got on the pedal.  Smiling the whole time, love it!
Nice video by Monaco based youtuber
YOURE JUST RUBBING IT OUR FACE
Out of the blue for me and first time watching Nico but this was great and fantastic chemistry between the two.
Matte and Grand tour, he wont be liking drifts anymore
I love Nico Rosberg sense of humor
I can see that winning formula drivers always if asked about their sons/daughters to get in the sport, they really don't want them to. Something about living on the limit they don't want them to do, same thing happened to Michael when asked about Mick.
What a treat. Even though I prefer naturally aspirated cars, it amazing to see what Rimac has been able to do. Inspiring and exciting.
Amazing car but let’s be honest, these batteries are horrific to our earth. Much more then oil, much more. Look at what you have to do to build these batteries.
Beautiful car. Thank you for sharing it with us.
That is a beautiful hypercar Nico. Congratulations on the purchase. Can't wait for more videos of you with the Nevera 👍
Fully electric? No thanks!
lover your contents, keep up champ.
Wow this car is so cool. Almost as cool as ______
Absolutely beautiful design 👍
We can tell Nico is an F1 driver the way he handled the car. Looking at his hands and head movements, I only had to imagine a helmet on and the Monaco track. Yes Nico, I would love seeing score some chrono on the Monaco track. Fantastic car. I still believe your F1 outperforms any super/hyper car on the track. Rimac has here the best performing production car in the world. I wish there was an Internal Combustion Engine or hybrid version.
I'm sorry but I'll never get excited for an EV. You do you though guys.
Car looks a little boring.
2000HP x 750W =  The carbon footprint of Times Square.
That is one good looking car
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.                       !!
What would I like to see? Barrel roll into the sea at the Monaco chicane. Rescued by frogmen, we hope. What do you plan to do with this thing? Where will you use it? Is this an investment? Talk to your wife. Listen. This is improper unbelievable.
first i taught mate was just a simple assistant a guy who would give some knowledge on the car he turned out to be extremely wealthy and talking about his hyper cars like nothing, just some vanish enjoyments! ,such an expressive guy even niko surprised by this dude and feels like he doesn't respect his humbleness well
If it's insane for a F1 World Champion imagine how.could be dangerous with a stupid and rich guy that could pay that car, and not even that, dangerous with all around driving  It's great than concept but a serious danger to drive!
Are you going to daily drive it?
I really respect and appreciate Mate business culture and ways of working it’s a shame so many large corporates can’t get this right, they have learned how to talk it, but they are never honest or absolute in the delivery, as a result the transformation culture never really works..  putting your money where your mouth is really counts.
New car and you got to ride with Mickey Mouse!!
So cool when hypercar goes to the man that actually can and will use it all capabilities.
I thought they were going fast until I saw a car just pass them like they were on stand still
Millions of dollars for one car and the interior looks out of 2003 lol  imagine if Tesla made a 3 million dollar hyper car 🤩
what did they do for the stone chipping noise? it seems was worked...
That car has 2,000 HP! that must be hard to beat.
Not much of a drive!
Millions of dollars for one car and the interior looks out of 2003 lol  imagine if Tesla made a 3 million dollar hyper car 🤩
This is better than any car journalist and shows how incredible F1 drivers are.....he acted like he was driving on a weekend run and scaring the builder like crazy.
It’s very impressive technology but rather than just making these faster, can you please think about making these EV’s emotive experiences. Rather than dead inertia.
Cool car and love the wheels 👍
Nico I love the car congratulations
I would love to hang out with Nico for a day.
I believe they lost a lot of cars, I mean Hammond totalled it in the mountains. Then this CTO guy. Lol 😁
Nico please lobby to make this car the F1 safety car!!
I think there is something wrong with your sound equipment. I don't hear that glorious engine screaming through the gears.
When you can control an F1 car without any electronic systems and you are a champion like Nico, I wouldn't be afraid at all, I would enjoy driving because you don't get driven by a world champion every day.
you're living my life Nico
Imagine if a grandma was pulling out of her driveway...
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
McLaren Ferrari front end, porche Corvette back end.
👍
I love that they had to blur out the speed when Nico was going wild on those hill curves
Nico. Do you think the back looks like a bit like a BMW?
is it faster than an F1 car?... no.
I get the same smile driving my 3.0L Liberty 😁
Mate Rimac seems like a "normal" version of "mad" genius - Elon Musk  (not that mad or crazy but certainly eccentric) in hyperfocus on the engineering, providing the best product, motivating his team to be the best, Free/transparent management style.    Very excited for Rimac and Bugatti.   Tesla roadster 2.0 has some serious competition!
WOW.......................................................................................................................................
Nice ride Nico
Wow what a car - I felt the drive just by watching the reaction from you both!!👏
I enjoyed watching that. Thanks!
Lets goooo, the monaco based YouTuber is back with another vid
CHAOS IS COMING...WORLDS FIRST ULTRACAR MAX POWER 2O48HP (0-100) 1,9 SECONDS  BY SPYROS PANOPOYLOS
Bravo Mate! ❤️ And Nico,keep buying cars from Mate,you see now he is good investment 😂
What car is this to get such an appraisal from a F1 champion?
Man, I wish I had that kind of money, this company seems like the type I'd like to support.
Dudes wearing white gloves like he didn't want to drive but a mile. ,🤣🤣 Nico is throwing rocks all over the carbon.  🤣🤣 Sweet ride bruh
I see he beat Lewis and got this car before him. 😂
It's not a hypercar it's a dyson Vacuum
What an impressive CEO, would love to work for him! The car is gorgeous. I have a Tesla Plaid, quick and practical, but no-where near this stylish or with this handling!
insane car ! but it looks like passenger seat not bolt in properly ))
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 truly a masterpiece!!!!
Outside of just the car, Mate is an insanely good person and manager. “The cleaning lady gets shares in the company, it’s not Mate’s car company”  Wow just wow
Wow!!! More more more, please more! Reactions of another people will be great, like your family, friends or another professional drivers. Seeing Mate and Nico in a new Nevera makes me just happy, really cool!
Gratuliere ihr zwei. Zum Kauf und zur Herstellung. Svaka čast
Sad to use such a hugely overrated driver here...in F1 and never did something to remember, more than lots of bad errors.  And he is almost as unsympathetic as his father. So why use him?
Monaco based YouTuber rides a supercar
Camera is facing the wrong way. No one wants to look at you two...we want to see the dash and the road.
so nico... i just get a comment that i am selected as a winner for your giveaway... and that i need to text you on telegram... and that i need to pay for package delivery... so i just wanna know is this a scam on your youtube channel or is that a real thing?
Warum hat er die Farbe seines Mercedes zensiert? Wieso muss das geheim bleiben?
i know these aren't drag cars, but it would be so cool to see an EV car with the capability to put all the power to the front wheels and then switch to all power to the rear wheels just to do a awd burnout at the track lol
Will you adapt to the internal "Gopros" of the Nevera?
And that is why I love my country🇭🇷
Nico...real deal, class act for sure.
Driving with F1 Champion and having no faith?! C’mon.
0:10 Nico: Let's have another Top Gear moment 😜 Mate: Nooooooo 😱
Came for the car, stayed for Mate. A true leader
AWESOME content!
That is one beautyful looking car such sleek lines.
Woow the care is just  amazing    the video  is awesome  loved it  thanks  Nico for shared it
What a sick car. Well deserved!
Mate se usro.... Pa ne vozi te pijani bosanac sa cackalicom u cvalji i komentarom: amo sad vidit mogul ovaj zavoj proc sa 100!!!!
Dont know if such cars should exist because its waste of energy even they are cool but the current situation in europe does not allowed energy waste of any kind even eletrical power.
I did Ferrari world in AD, 0 to 250kmh in less than 5s...😀
The only bad thing about this video is that it ends !   Mate is such an inspiration too a lot of young croatians.
Soo when i see Nico who was driving an F1 car for several years getting amazed by this car, then how would a normal men like me react to this car?  No words just respect to Rimac
looks fantastic
These guys don’t feel sorry…
Awesome video! 😆 Love Mates reaction and the Batman-Spec 😍
I love the honesty Nico! Enjoy that new masterpiece you've purchased 🔥🏁
Looks too much like a Mclaren
Ye but nico race driver...the other guy... 🤣🤣🤣 no words..
Nico please go on Nordschleife and post video! That would be great to set time there!
I am so freaking proud that one of the people from our lovely Balkan (doesnt matter which nation) has made something so crazy that every single person in world appriciate. But the most important thing is not what he managed to build up....thats how humble this man is and how he treats his emploies and that "Every employe has a share of our company, because i want them to feel that its not just Mate Rimac company, but theirs also" huge respect on this! @Nico Rosberg no words can describe what a man you are yourself and this passion that you express by driving this car is insane!!!! I loved and enjoyed each second of this video and the ones before!!! Much love from Munich!
Why is Homelander driving?
From watching Mate it seems like he built this for the love of pushing engineering as far as he could for the sake of the engineering.  I wonder if he ever imagined himself in the result of all that work with a world champion, experiencing the result of that engineering driving it for the sake of operformance.
Nice!
6.19 Hammond flashbacks intensify
20:31 “I bought Bugatti Company from selling 1% of my shares in the Company” god damn son 😍
Mate is so protective of the car like a worrying father 😂
Love the car Nico…
Extraordinary car for extraordinary men.
Alles ist so richtig krass und dann kommt der Spiegel haha
geil
Two insane legends!!
Nice Video Only if u had driven the car alone and not with the CEO of Rimac
Nico you are legend
If Mate gets a test driver for his car's he won't have any problems rating them because his already experienced the best with Nico 👏
What’s the cost of servicing ? Tires? Charging rate? Accessories I.e. charging equipment?
My mans face when Nico starts pushing it hahaah 🥹😂 min 12:39 hahaa
Tesla Roadster 2 says “Hold my beer….”
I know they're great drivers etc but isn't this recorded evidence of breaking the speed limit? 😂
nico just seems like a cool guy
Everything is good,perfomance,comfort,everything but there is 1 thing... Its Elecrtic, cant hear the great engine sound
Two kings!:)
@Nico, please take this car to the Nurburgring
Nurburgring hotlap WHEN ? : D
Thank you for making this Clip! I got goosebumps from beginning till the end. I follow mate since the beginning and I really enjoy watching you two in his car. What a great job. Well done Mate!! Respect!!
The guy from rimac is the New elon Musk, he is a visionair and gives responsibility to his workers and let them perform. This is how it works. All the top down companies with hierarchy style management in france germany and england Will never grow big with a few employees. I love the interview you did with him nico. Congrats with your car. 👍🏻
Nico it’s time to invest in a proper microphone, now you have a 2000 hp hypercar. Your 1st trip was nice but a lot of wind noise :(
B R A V O!!!!
I want to see this new boy in town smoke all of the times  think should be at the top, AND THEN put it on AUTOPILOT and make it beat all the times not with one hand, but without a driver in it hehehe... ok, i'm still dreaming 10 years in the future. (7 months in Mate- time, cca)
All i hear is sad hammond cries.
I thought I wouldn’t like the black seemed kind of boring but it looks great with the wheels in the natural light👍.  I like how they are talking about their super cars like we talk about our little pos commuter cars 😂
Where are all those little shitpile plaids at .lol
Nico, the car looks amazing! Great specs! Enjoy your ride!
"These (rich ashole totals the car) guys don't feel sorry"
It is insane in a sane way...😂
Congratulations on an awesome car first of all, I love the spec, also a very interesting and informative video given in such a relaxed style it was one of the best car videos I have ever seen.  Thank you for sharing.
why not carboceramic to go beyond heat limit?
It's really a masterpiece !
Pretty damn good advertisement for a car
The only flaw about the car is the color. 😜😁👍🏻
Fantastic preview! Look forward to seeing you run it in Monaco
Richard Hammond has clearly made mate very nervous when other people drive his cars
Maté’s attitude toward other human beings (his employees, in this instance) of treating them as he would want to be treated (“The Golden Rule”) is so admirable and refreshing. He deserves his every success.  Nice channel, Nico. Yes, I adore the Nevera and look forward to owning one in the future.  Blessings, Grace and Peace 😊
A fantastc piece of engineering made by maybe the best, alongside with Koenigsegg, inspiring automotive companies in the world. What a journey and how inspiring! 🙏👌 Wish them all the best in future.🍀  And Nico, you should do a night lap along the gp-route in almost total silence and darkness (if possible in Monaco 😉) with no traffic….just a swoossshhhh
Why standard seatbelts in super sport car? 😷
I always love Mate`s reactions when someone drives fast 🤣 I mean c'mon, when F1 driver tells you: You can believe me! You can! No matter how fast Nico would drive, I would just sit there and enjoy being driven by F1 champ.
Nico Get real ! 2000 bhp? For what ? You guys are all pre historic ! We are on planet earth where petrol is so expensive cars are too expensive to run !
"Faster than a Chiron", Big words!!
I'm glad he agrees the AMG ain't special. I was so disappointed once I saw it at Goodwood.
It's like Mate Rimac is riding a roller coaster when Nico is driving. I'm not sure if Mate likes roller coasters. 🤣
Eine schnelle Runde irgendwann und irgendwo im alten Nico Race Mode mit diesem Auto! Darauf würde ich mich freuen.
This video made me go for a ride on my BMW R nineT.
That looks stunning, so beautifully proportioned, and yet so useable. Lucky fella :)
Pants still dry in one moment...the next one (min 13.51) wet pants in  the hands
Epic
Mate you really need to trust me! NO, NO NO NO! Mate, it's not a problem hahahhaa :) PURE GOLD!
"Red as well" so the amg 1 is gonna be red lol
I think the passenger had to change his pants lol 😆 😂
Amazing guy Nico. Really smart Mate and unbelievable crazy car.  When you impress F1 driver than you can say, I made it!! Excellent job Mate and great drive Nico! It's been a pleasure to see and listen you two!👏👏
Nico is LEGEND, and this video is perfection ❤️
Rimac: you can go in sport mode… Nico: no…I like track mode😂 Reminds me of the first drive last year when Rimac was asking Nico to push the breaks…so he knows what it feels like😂
Tell him Nico you are F1 World Champion  don't worry you can DRIVE!!!!! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
roll down the windows and let the song by ...Nada Topčagić "jutro je" play!!!
That is not hypercar - that is hyper S*IT!  Even Rosberg cant change that simple fact!
utterly brilliant
Mate: "I never worked before. It's my first job." Well, I think that's good enough for first one, aye? :D
nico.. i am croatian and i respect mate rimac and his work.. but this car is something else... future, future and more future...  this car in that black color is amazing... good choice for you.,.. hope that you will have fun and good grip.. :)
One of the few passioned persons making rara and perfect cars   , you can feel and see from his eyes , how he loves , focused , passioned making "perfect" hyper car  , Mate Rimac .... you can see the same feeling on : Pagani and Koenigsegg company owners the same PASSION ... You need to WANT , BELIEVE , target to PERFECTION and you will win .... CONGRATULATION !!!!   , SUCCES is NEVER the OUTCOME of a CHANCE.
I wonder, why is it shot on gopros mounted on the glass, if the car itself can take videos through it’s interior cameras?
When are you going to take it on track!!?
0-300kmh in 9 sec.. Amazing
Amazing!!!!!!
10:03 "so where do you want to be in 10 years with Rimac?" Oo - I don't know. How about moving beyond prototypes? How about actually selling a car?
The Beast .. good car Nico congratulations 💯 Power
Absolutely FLAWLESS intro to this video. Was Laughing so hard
Warum fliegst du wenn du das auto gekauft hast? 😁
I have it on my pubg new state game 🥲
I love everything about this video! Love the spec of the rimac..it looks so sleek and classy...love how honest both of you were in the video from going on about how disapppointing the project one was to LaF not having enough traction to put the power down(most people who have driven one would not have anything bad to say about it so i love your honesty because I agree on that for many Ferraris not just LaFerrari. but most people would disagree without having driven one themselves.) also funny how you bash his project one spec so directly! haha.   I do however think the Valkyrie also have the same problem with putting the power down to the traction. Its great to see someone of your status review cars honestly and still be w0wed by experience...Watching your expressions tells me more about the car's actual experience more than watching the car go around a track or having someone review it by just saying great things about it in order to not offend the companies. subbed!
Did he just start warming the tires on the freeway?😂
when Nico said why so much traction in Sport Mode 😂😂😂😂
Its all fun and games until a honda civic with a laptop pulls up next to you 😂
Nico Europeans are far, far behind China,. Go there and make videos with their electric cars. Number one now in the market are chines!!!
The smile on Nico’s face says it all !
@ 9:29 On the helmet of your dad it says ICI (Uniqema), my mom worked there till it shut down back in 2002 in Everberg Belgium. Cool to see that logo again! When there were parties at ICI, Thierry Boutson's F1 car was there on a stand because they were sponsoring him back in the days. Edit: Just heard my mom, so ICI were sponsoring Keke Rosberg of course and Nigel Mansell
So viel für ein Auto und dann ist der Rückspiegel aus Plastik 😅
5:32 the way he responded
Nico, you past my house in one of the village :)
This reminds me of Ayrton Senna and the NSX.  The feedback from a former F1 Championship driver is probably the best compliment Rimac can hear.  I owned an NSX and was my favorite car of all time because it was so fun to drive.
its sad to see the W16 engine go from bugatti tho...such a masterpiece of engineering is beeing lost...but I'm pretty sure it will always forever be a masterpiece.
Incredible! I think it would be interesting if Nico puts this car in some tracks to try some lap records 👀
Yay, Bugatti continues with a combustion engine 🤙🏾 albeit hybrid. Now what engine that is the question? Don’t think W16 maybe downsize
21:55 mmmmmmm... Maybe it is too much money for this. Youtube is good, but 2 mil bucks )))))))))))))))
You made it Mejt, car drive for almost 30 minutes without  fire.
What a beautiful car
Great Video!
I bet Mate needed to change his undies after 😂😂😂
Surprised to hear Nico say apart from the F1 engine the AMG 1 has nothing special. The AMG 1 looks better than the Nivera. What would be awesome to see is Nico and Keke on the Monaco track. One in Nico's AMG 1 when it arrives and the other in the Nevera in a no holes barred race of a few laps.
"These guys don't feel sorry"
WAOOO Amazing and 1 fantastic car.! What options are/what is the best thing on your car you absolutely 💯 love?
From 11:40 onward, hilarious. Maté’s looking a little green 🤢 and Nico’s just out for a Sunday drive. I love how the telemetry is blurred out. Don’t want to provide proof that they’re going 3-4x the speed limit. 🤣
the rimac owner dude is pure class. clearly very smart, very passionate, completely focused on his objectives
is this car good or no
Absolutely stunning. I’d love to see one in person. Beautiful beautiful beautiful 👌🏻
Nico, why do you keep popping up on my feed?! Please stop
They could totally try the record for Pikes Peak with this car on stock.
Aaaaa... to ste kod Markovog Polja vozili... I Samorskog gorje možda? Obilaznica od Sesveta do Samobora?
Gives me viper vibes in front and ccx rear.
Will ich haben :)
But it’s electric!!!! 🤢🤢
Incredible car. If I lived where his company is I might end up working there. Sounds like a great environment. Interesting what you said about the AMG One. I’m not really surprised with such a small displacement engine and such a big nose. The La Ferrari is such a cool expression of a hypercar from Ferrari even if it’s not as logically designed as a Rimac. It’s an expression off emotion, adrenaline thrills, and Italian automotive art. It’s more about fun than science. Pure love on four wheels! On another subject it’s really hard to write and edit in this new box as the script jumps around. Google did a poor job of executing this. But, the Rimac is s as stupendous an execution of automotive technology as there is. Looking forward to what he does next. I wonder, without the sounding of a winding up ICE engine as a soundtrack to the driving experience, does anything feel lacking, or is it more pleasant to have quiet but amazing acceleration? I’ve wondered …
2000 HP !!!!!! how is that possible
Nico's House, where no means yes and yes means faster lol.
Incredible
Hi Nico, Thanks for the drive. I love to look out of the windshield and see the dash, your hands and the upcoming road. You can Really compare cars that way. Keep Smiling. 😎🖖
Bravo Mate kralju!!! 🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷
This is actually a really nice video. Mate is such a candid, honest, smart guy. What an inspiration!
Probably the worst environmental decision you have made. An ICE car would be better for the first 100k km... So let's see if you will put more than that on it.
crazy things a man has done to be chauffeured to the airport by a former f1 world champion for free xD
Simply amazing car.  I loved hearing your conversation about the dynamics of the car and Mate Rimac's corporate philosophy.
😍
Brilliant! Nico playing with Mate & his ‘toy’ 😎
As an engineering graduate, it's phenomenal to see how much technology has advanced over the last couple of decades.  What a car!  Nico's big smile says it all :)  Mate seems like an incredibly down to earth guy.  Happy to see him achieve so much success.  Keep up the good work.
Nico hyped it so I am getting one
🥲🤯❤💓❤
The back is ilke BMW i 😂😂😂😂
look at the navigation at 13:00 - it cant keep up :D
23:38 Whay the gay on right is driving with open trunk🤣🤣
Anyone knows what is the name of the background music at 2:00? Thanks in advance!
So seriously what’s the point useless car don’t have 4 wheel steer if Nico had a chat with Gordon Murray and Learn a few things more important than Speed and acceleration.
mate sounds a bit like every Croatian mom :D :D
All about the self...and perpetuating toxic materialist shystems.
To see the consistent smile on Nico's face the entire first drive, and then scaring the heck out of Mate is priceless!  Congratulations on the new car, Nico, but keep all four wheels on the ground since I'd hate to hear that you crashed the car.  And for Mate, good luck collecting your cars, and I wish you the best in your endeavors in the future.
First time seeing this channel and I'm more interested in the fact that this guy has almost a million views in less than 24 hrs... Wow! Ching$Ching
It´s a good thing to know, La ferrari isn´t really that good. Now I don´t need to buy one.
The  car is  just  A.M.A.Z.I.N.G  !!!  Ultimate  drag  car  ever...Nico...great driver , F1  champion...great  car  choice...smart...
I really cant think of a better person to complement a car than an actual f1 driver this car is mental !
.... no no these guys dont feel sorry... 🙄
Congrats!
I wonder how fast they were going on that regional road?
Great video, Nico.
honestley one of the best looking cars to come out in the last few years, futuristic and aerodynamic but still elegant. alot of companies are overdoing alot of things in design but this seem so balance things very well.
Whenever Matt is a passenger - "Oh God, I've created a monster...." 😂
really loving how the car choice turned out ... when it all started with what car to buy, I'd have never thought it goes this far
The guy said 70% rear then when Nico said so I will have 100% rear, the guy said no now you have 70% rear and front then you will have 100% both okkkk !!!! he is very confused
This is what the future looks like....I love that Rimac is forcing hypercars to go EV the same way Tesla pushed the rest of the industry. ICE age really is coming to an end.
"These guys don't feel sorry"
Brilliant video Nico thanks for sharing this experience with us. And Mate is a super nice guy and just goes to show you don’t have to be a *#**##** to be successful in business.
What a great video. I always liked you, Nico, for being an honest person and a great driver (in that order). But this driving and chat. Perfect! Great minds think alike and great persons attract great people! What a guy Mate Rimac is. We need more people with his values in charge of this world! Bravo! Keep it up!!!!
Haha, Mate was really holding on to his lunch in this one....
What is the difference between normal people and no normal people?
So many engineering details coming from both of these engineers' amazing comments....absolutely stunning to listen to!!
Mate’s reactions are priceless.
His very lucky its not lewis Hamilton or max they would plant the foot loool nico is a gentleman lol i dont like the look of the car just looks like a tipical supersports and to think there's Toyota supras faster with 3.000bhp loool now that mental lol
M principal giggles badass car
Wolltest Du nicht was mit Umweltschutz machen?
Ein vw polo g40 macht auch Spaß
Grande Nico! Ma chi te lo fa fare di tornare in quel mondo di pazzi della F1 😂 vinto il campionato boom, signori me ne vado e me la spasso… numero 1. Se passi da Bergamo rispondi al commento che ci facciamo un panino con la salamela è una birra 🍺
Grande Nico! Ma chi te lo fa fare di tornare in quel mondo di pazzi della F1 😂 vinto il campionato boom, signori me ne vado e me la spasso… numero 1. Se passi da Bergamo rispondi al commento che ci facciamo un panino con la salamela è una birra 🍺
Rimac seems like a great company to work for!  This video was a pleasure on so many levels to watch!
It's pretty shocking when a 'street' car is pretty close in performance to a recent F1 car.  It would be interesting to see the Remac on a track trying to set a lap record and compare it to some of the best F1 times. Tells me that F1 needs to take the handcuffs off the current cars.
My wife a Nevera too... Dont no if she are the same performance there...
Lol, “these guys don’t feel sorry” - that was funny 😆
Imagine if Mate would have screamed: Please Nico, slow down! You are not Lewis Hamilton! Darkness would descent over Nico, his heartrate raised, his hands gripping the steeringwheel, a long exhale and the words: "It's time for some qualifyers"
Who inspired him(Mate) to work as he works, having everyone at the firm owning assest on themselvz? The mentality of the joung croatian spirit, growing up in a certian time and place with specific people, a little bit of irony, and beeing involved in forming an unbelivable story with his own hands.. This is what's behind his mentality Nico..
I really feel like these guys will be good friends
That is a true entrepreneur with a big heart, will out do Elon Musk with his enlightened employment style!  If you have something to gain if company does well, motivation through employment, they do their best
amazing!
12:20 He's having flashbacks to hammond.
Who is the imbecile editor that kept the rearward in cabin vision rather than outward windscreen vision through the mountain pass? Fire him now.
Incredible car! Question: is the rear view mirror housing plastic? Looks like it is...wonder why they didn't make that metal or CF (could it be that it's a regulated item like the seatbelt buckles? ... but there are other hyper cars that have unique/exotic materials for their rear view mirror housings)
@13'09" the Satnav not a selling point!
Great spec
Must have a 4k barra in it. 👍
Damn I want to drive this car NOW
Thank you nico for share this with us! And thanks too rimac for this amazing car🫶
15:00 It will never overheat? No matter how crazy I drive ?
simply love this king of content!! Congrats Nico and Mate for bringing us this master piece!!
Still the best E car of the world by today. Love it
Imagine one day you're one day driving home from work and the guy who beat Lewis Hamilton in equal machinery just randomly passes you in a Rimac Nevera.
I have the utmost respect for Mate, what an incredible person. Yes, involve and let all employees own a little bit of the company and all will strive towards success!  Amazing guy! Must have very good parents ;)
imagine a guy that beat 7x world champion lewis hamilton in same machinery drives your car and calls it insane 37894 times
Both guys are awsome! It was a fun to watch this video!
U should bought a tank this not make enough pollution....
Cool vid an all, but I’m really more curious to see what Sir Lewis could do with the same machinery
Electric car sucksssss
You have to trust a champions word 😉
Nico, Grobnik is waiting for you and your car ;)
The Nevera is an absolute piece of art. Well done to the designers and all involved in the creation of it, (int & ext). And a special shout out to the mechanical team...a MASSIVE 👍! Also, Nico, thnx for the chuckle iro the drifting teaser!! I could almost feel Mate's fear. Cheers, and enjoy the 💩out of it!!
I'm just waiting for the brain child of Mate Rimac and Christian Von Koenigsegg.  In house designed and built flux capacitor, hyper drive....
I honestly think that Rimac should invite Nico to try the prototype of their next car so that he won't have as much traction control in sport
So it's ok to break every traffic law imaginable as long as you're rich and famous? Got it.
I want one.
"because it's more than enough" epic reply!!!!
Angeber
For such an amazing hypercar, it looks unremarkable. Don't get me wrong, the performance is up there. But I reckon a chiron looks more striking side by side 😉
This seems like the beginning of a long friendship :) Such a cool video! I really enjoyed the conversation ☺️
Great car, video... Thanks Big 👍🏻
Haha dude was scared there's no need it's Nico!!
Man, Mate is awesome! I hope he gets to achieve great things with Rimac and his plans. The Nevera is an absolute beast of a machine.
Mate and Nico both are coming with good intentions with full transparency , it's kinda uncommon for car manufacturers CEOs and F1 drivers. I truly enjoy these videos they feel so authentic.
Nico def made him put the gloves back on at 8:00
Awesome, thanks Nico. Great deal
Awesome video, awesome car and great conversation...congratulations Nico, enjoy your car and cant wait to see what's next for you and your Nevera.
Call a few close friends, hang a 200 euro banknote on the cockpit, when the acceleration starts, whoever reaches the banknote can take it.
Best thing on the market
Ok the car is amazing, but that man, man hes lovely and soo mesmerizing, I was soo into the whole convo with Rosberg and Rimac fr man he's amazing.
Proper proper fetish
Man that car looks incredible! How amazing it must be to drive, let alone own one
Monaco-based Youtuber
I wonder if he asked matte to put those dumb gloves back on? The look of matte when it shows him wearing his gloves in the car, he looks annoyed.
You simply can't not like Mate enough for his management philosophy. In my opinion, Mate's likeability factor is sky high! Kudos to Mate and everything he has achieved with his company so far.
12:56 the navigation has no clue what's going on :D
Wow...What a car.  The fact that you were impressed makes me think that the car must be amazing.  I love the fact how you scare Rimac when he thinks you are about to drift "his baby!"  Also impressed with Rimac and his business ideas and makes me want to see him succeed in everything he does.  He seems like a humble guy and I hope that he always stays that way.  Thanks again Nico for the incredible content and congrats on this beautiful car!  All the best
Amazing Nico! Thanks for this high quality content
Amazing Nico... enjoy your beauty beast
The car looks soo good damn
amazing car. congratulations nico🫡
This guys is really good at driving, should try racing seriously i believe. Might do well in it.
It's fun to see it driven through my town and Mate speechless through this hairpins
Nicos smile says it all.....
Awesome car - pure electric is the way to Go!
19:24 he doesn't micromanage which is the exact opposite of Lawrence stroll and why he's killing Aston Martin
I'm sooooo jel
One of the best "interviews" in car history.
Mate loves power sliding, but not when someone else is driving, not even a Formula 1 championship driver. Haha!
i loved Nico messing with Mate hahahaha
It is great to see Nico and Maté together for Nico’s first drive.  I have great respect for both of them, and wish them the best.  Their respect for each other shows in their conversation, which was very interesting to hear.  The car Maté and the Rimac team has created is truly the ultimate supercar, and this video showcases it well.
amazing car and that black looks great! Interior seems to be super quiet and that finish is on top. I understand Mate with his full carbon finish :D
15:50 Mate didn't like Nico bashing Mercedes-Benz and stopped him right there.
Mate's a genius he's the version of Elon musk I'll like to meet
More Rimac content please
Insaneeeeee
14:25 the poor old man is trying to get someone to look at the car but Nico drives away 😄
Why not more power in the Sports? Because it‘s more than enough!  Killer 😂🤣
Well... It's the same i8 from the back!
Loved the genuine fear on Mate's face, his clenched hands and the (unsuccessful) try to show none of it. Great video, awesome car!
Wow, nice car
Mate about the rich Ceo crashing his car: "these guys don't feel sorry."
making what like 30  a year?  That is not a production car ... if you say a lie 100 times its still a lie?!?
Does Mclaren have anything to do with the design, as, this looks like a Mclaren
11:19 - Rinac for normal people? :D I would love to drive electric Rimac car for masses
Amazing car, its almost  as fast as my Renault Clio from 2003
Bye bye Plaid
6:30 you have to get used to the car you have together used to the car  NONOnonon ehehehaha
The car turned out brilliant, congratulations. And please, more and more of Mate, he’s funny, transparent, brilliant engineer and sounds like a great boss
Small detail, Sport mode is almost 50% more powerful than the lesser mode, not 30%!!! One HEL* of a car :)
Kind of lol doing a drift on the first drive with the new car 😂 after 23min video nico still doesnt understand that sport has 70 and track 100 % 😂   Only thing, they should habe done the mirror inside in carbonfiber also
Nice car Nico :)
It will be Bankrupt in a year. It will be a nice write off for Goldman. Nico talks bad about Mercedes??? That kind of talk has no credibility!
I’ve raided my piggy bank and threatened the bank manager, still not got enough money ☹️
Sick car 🥰
Gude aus Wiesbaden! Sieht schick aus, aber ein paar Zeiten ( 100 auf 200 ) wären schön mal zu sehen. Bleib gesund :) Gruß Heiko
Conggratulation😁. What a car😎😎😎
Great video, car, driver, and passenger! :D
5:30
it's impressive, and it is easily the best looking EV (including the sea of concepts). but an EV still misses two parts of driving that I enjoy too much to give up, and that is the sound and a manual transmission.
„these guys dont feel sorry“ haha
its an electrocar? whats the range?
sieht aus wie i8 von hinten oder?
It is nice but it should have a v12 engine
Looks almost as much fun as my 1993 TVR - the future is indeed bright …
This showed up in my feed and I'm so glad I clicked. The car guy sounds like a cool dude to know and work for. The car looks good, I hope they do very well selling these cars. Also, Nico is an interesting conversation. He asked some really good questions and kept the conversation interesting.
now sell the car and use the funds to supply food or water or housing   to people that really need it (just a thought)
To me, rims are too shiny.
Super interesting. Mate is my new hero.
No Richard Hammond?
what a amazing machine
I'm a self confessed Mate Rimac fanboi......and NR's questioning technique is superb. Great video.
Thanks for this review, now i’m ready ti buy this car
13:14 I see Donkey from Shrek 😲
LOVE THIS CARE beautiful spec. Will hold the test of time
I'm guessing the CTO of that big car company who totaled the car had to pay for all damages? Or all insurance?
Awesome to see the production car out in the wild with its owner. Looking forward to seeing you after some time with the car and sharing the experiences. Mate getting first hand feedback looks so proud of what's achieved, excellent
Congrats Nico and Mate!! 👏💪
People dont comprehend what the electric era will bring us. And we are still at the start. Give it 20 years and we will see this performance in cars for the middle class - and the political debate if power should be limited
13:00 Navigation bug
It seems Mate has unleashed a monster that even he fears. 🙂
well he’s clearly better than hammond
he makes me want  to work for him haha
How much did they pay you?
Just wow. Mate’s approach to company structure and culture is amazing
Nico is sharing his honest opinions and is not holding back - that is so cool!
what do you mean "what do you think of this car?" I only saw two guys driving on the freeway and the inside of the car.
@1:36 you look like Jay Leno
Amazing achivement by Mate Rimac. Impatiently waiting for the second chapter!
that's absolutely awsome, big credit to Mr. Rimac, achieved so much for a young guy, inspirational.
This car is next level, hands down. Time to pulverise Porsche's fresh Nurburgring lap time haha
I know what you both look like! can you take car on autoban and show the car!!!
Jojjjj kako bi je Dena "istestirooooo mati milaaa.uh uh uh .
Came for the car, stayed for the conversation. Great video.
Will you race it on track against a F1 car to see how quick this is?
Awsome car, thx Nico and RImac!!!
Tolles Auto, aber ich vermisse noch ein Video mit Test 0-100, 0-200, 0-300 ;-) und natürlich V-Max., außerdem finde ich bei so einem außergewöhnlichen und auffallenden Auto, eine coolere Lackierung, nicht langweiliges schwarz. Da kann es schon krachen, da das Auto auch schon so auffällt, dann gleich richtig. 🙂
Electric? Boring
Mate Rimac and Christian Von Keonigsegg. One of the greatest and most humble CEOs in the car community.
Glad seeing Nico Rosberg 2016 F1 World Champion who did beat Lewis Hamilton in the same Machinery enjoying his Rimac!
12:58 Beautiful car but have to fix problems with the navi map
So beautiful ❤️
i kinda like this youtuber from Monaco. Keep it up! 😛
Thank you in shearing a true first experience in driving something is "yours". I was proud also to see also that you were proud and enjoyed of what Mate done. Congratulation Nico for that! MAte is a real visionary! I hope I could work in this company! Bravo!
Inspiring owner of the Company! Great guy!
Yo why he have a neckbeard? Makes him look like he smells
Mate has a awesome business model, I wish more companies would do that.
13:01 The GPS got confused for a moment there
Congratulations to both of you. God bless.
Can Richard Hammond drift the new Rimac?
12:20  "Why is there so much traction control?" Mate looks like his life is flashing before his eyes lol
I think Mate was the happiest man in the world when he came out of Nevera. Mate, this was one of the fiercest "Nevera" in your life. Both of you are quite inspirational.
I wander how a Tesla Plaid will do from 0 to 100 km is it 1.1 seconds , is it faster that this
Nico should do top gear he would make great presenter plus him against Chris Harris would be good to watch
Bravo Mate, good luck Nico! 🇧🇦🇧🇦🇧🇦
so good to see you behaved yourself .. I was 1980 Donnington GT championship class winner . It is so easy to frighten a passenger    but not cool . I once was passenger with a young show off driver . I pulled his hair back so he couldn,t see the road ..  Then I walked home .. when you are a truly great driver   it is not needed to showboat.
Love how Nico wanted to downplay the laferrari but Mate was like nah i love it, humble guy, the only good thing that came out of Croatia in a longer time
a production limit to 150 vehicles is called a production car?
Congrats Nico, it’s amazing!
Awesome car Nico, just like you !
dont know who this guy is but hes a giga chad
Did someone notice GPS all fked?😂
What a nice vid with the two of you. Such down to earth characters. Would love to see some power slide with the Rimac Nevera in Monaco.. =)
The car is thinking „Jeeez, I could have had a comfortable life in a fancy garage somewhere, but no. I had to go to Nico of all people. It’s gonna be a tough life“ 😅
10:00 remarkable Statement.
Poor Mate! You could see the anxiety in his eyes.
Mate struggling to hold conversation for fear of his life 😂😂 don’t blame you!
how often will you drive it?
I like Nico „German“ attitude…he is not ashamed to ask again if he doesn’t get a point.
the fact this is the second car they've released and it is what it is amazes me. Mate is on track to be one of the car industry legends for many years to come!
"I should have included grab handles for the passenger"
7:39  Nico: "That is how you get money (of the CTO) when they feel sorry."  Mate " These guys never feel sorry.. -.-" 😅😂
Didn't he want a red one??
is that the guy who beat the 7 time WDC in equal machinery at the 2016 season?
I think you need another seat belt mount?  a three point isn’t enough in my humble opinion.
what a nice guy !
Croatia, a very poor country, now we know why!
No wonder that a driver that beat a 7 time world champion Lewis Hamilton in equal machinery, will be a first owner of a real life batmobile.
If the has a million cameras built in why are they using GoPros?
when is RIMACs IPO date, anybody know?
Klima funktioniert,bringt aber anscheinend nix wenn man mit dir fährt,der Mate muss die Handschuhe trotzdem ausziehen 😂 Mate Car
The Car is very nice
It's not RimaK! Can you learn.. Rimac (Rimatz)
You can see Nico thoroughly enjoyed that
LOL der arme ;) ich hätte mir längst in die Hose gemacht:)
servus!!da hast ein wunderschönes neues auto!!hoffe du hast viel freude damit!!bitte keinen unfall bauen!!viel spass damit!!!👍👍👍👍
Back to Sport Mode? Err.... NO.....I quite like track mode
I was a valet and been in some nice cars....   damn that is a nice car....
pants are still dry 🤣
Easy one of the best conversations between two car enthusiasts. Amazing car. Congrats!
would love a drive with nico,insane
hypercar is for loser.... spacecar is for man🤣
258mph, please.
Hi Nico! What do you think will happen when Christian releases his first all electric car? Perhaps called Koenigsegg Eliminera.  /Håkan
The last part of the conversation should be shared across Business Schools and with a lot of current companies CEOs across the world... Congrats Mate and great car Nico!!
Awesome Car! You both are awesome 😎
I want to see this beast on the track
Nico Sir, yesterday I gave my sister new tata Tiago gift on Raksha bandhan..
Nico the legend
Oh Nico !  It seems like such a lovely vehicle.  I'd really love to try it out.  Maybe we can do a Collab video ..??  I've had my YouTube channel for five years now and I have 2 subscribers.  I post varied.  Thanks Nic o, and I speak to you later, just text me buddy .
0-300km/h in 9 seconds. As Nico says, "Incredible, Incredible..."
Ein sehr schönes Video mit viel Ausdruck. Ich wünsch dir das du lange Freude mit dem aufkommenden Sturm haben wirst 🙂 Ich freue mich schon auf das nächst Video mit dem Auto Meine Vorschlag mit deinem neuen Auto ein zwei Runden mit Dir in Monaco zu Gewinnen!
Why is he not going to F1 as well? The best car developer inside one huge "area", in the F1.
Great video, phenomenal car,  likeable people and good chemistry. You too should do a car review show
This car is nuts indeed, cannot help it, I bloody miss that ear tearing noise from petrol engine though
Beautiful car. Thanks for the ride.
Just superb, the intelligent conversation between engineers as well as the driving. And humour - Its good to have insurance, we will need that :-) Nico goes home sets plan in motion to sell the Mercedes after a few weeks of ownership...🙂 Re the management change - tell me about it, French style isnt great
Nico's hand is still shifting i love it
"Drift Mode?" Mate:  ಠ_ಠ
At 12:15 Richard Hammond would be a puddle of sweat
am crying
We need more Socialists in this world! Capitalism is dead!! 💙
i love, how Nico still uses single german words in his english sentenses xD
What do women of Monaco say and think about this electric beast.
Nordschleife Lap pls
Once again -  Nico is an excellent interviewer!
Super cool to not only see the car, but also hear from Mate about his management philosophy. The more I learn about Rimac the more I like the company. Seems to be a good place to work!
Thanks for a fantastic video. The car is amazing but I'm even more impressed with Mate and the Rimac company. Mate is such an interesting and down to earth guy. I really enjoyed the discussions and I think you should do more talks like that with other car personalities. These chats/interviews are so interesting and fascinating.
How they blurred passenger speed screen so there is no evidence that they break speed limit by far…
The Rimac Nevera beat nearly every F1 car in a speed test but sadly couldn't match the speed of the Ferrari 2019 car😁
Congratulations Nico. Great seeing how happy it made you. Very happy for you 👍
Mate and his Nevera are so down to Earth. Mate for his modesty and his car for its traction
Looking forward to Ken Block drifting this beauty.
Love the colour. Black works well for the Rimac style. I would love to see what it looks like in yellow, because I like every car in yellow.
Love love
I love that you can actually press the throttle and feel the power transfer to the road and not have the wheels spininng. That's the true mastery of engineering. Glad you enjoy your new car Nico!
I love the car and super impressive story behind the company, but that rearview mirror is a disgrace...
7:45 "these guys never feel sorry" Yap! Well said!
this guy is too bossy. either he owns it or not. who is telling fibs
Best new car instruction ever. Well done!
Mate✝️🙏💪❤️🇭🇷
a Real world champion
No autonomous drive, please
Congrads Niko ...a champ worthy purchase i'd say lol ... What a car, what an engineering, what a passion behind the work... Fantastic job to Rimac and everyone involved in this creation. I gotta say  @6:11 Niko has a very veeeery suspicious evil smile ... a few secs Later  we saw why LOL
What a great guy Mate. Nico is cool and Mate is just pure class. Most intelligent people are a bit geeky but Mate seems like a guy you could have a few drinks with and wouldn't even know he's doing such amazing things. Great video.
Anybody knows the song from 15:46 - it is stuck in my head and I can't find it anywhere?
This guy is a CEO and a Founder of a very successful company that he built from the ground up but acting like an untitled basic employee.🤔🤘👍.
# Tailormade # --- for the future ---
The car is astonishing!!! Mate is such a jenuine good guy; I love the way he talks about his employees and the way he treats them.
Quite possibly the nicest bloke who didn't get corrupted by F1. Beautiful car and inspiring CEO.
I love this experience with Rimac! That owner is amazing guy and giving really possitive vibe! :)
One of the best car reviews I’ve seen.  Great dialogue between two experts of their trade. Excellent!!!
You need to drive this car with this guy at Monaco as fast as possible. 🙂
Hope you’re not friends with Richard Hammond, if you are, keep him away!
Je li to F1 prvak Nico Rosberg koji je 2016. dobio sedmerostrukog dobitnika Formule 1 Lewisa Hamiltona u istoj mašineriji?
What a stunning machine. Well done m8. I don't love the rims but then again  it ain't my car. Stay safe bud
Beyond lovely
Brilliant!
Massive respect
Mate you made it man, congratulations
anyone noticing the gps can't track anything
Quality car, great story as well
Much respect for Mate
Great job on the car. And Mate, what a visionary…what an inspiration
hes a F1 world champ wdym he has to get used to the car🤣🤣
Should have bought a Lotus Evija.
Mate is so a nice guy ❕👌🏼 Love from Berlin 🇩🇪 Ramsi 🙋🏻‍♂️
LOVE THE CAR , but seems weird with No Engine noise
1400KW max power… one minute of full power would take 7 hours 45 minutes to recharge on a standard UK socket
What a cool guy
Poor Mate going up that hill lol, Nico in proper wind up mode, amazing car and amazing achievement doing what he has done.  Sounds like he has his head screwed on and running a great company the right way also.
Der Mate hatte in einen moment Angst …:)
Mate is simply the most humble guy ever!
The way Nico smiles when he accelerates, is the only review that actualy count.
7'44''
Really pure joy when you put your efforts in your dreams like Mate...and then there is Nico, der immer Spaß macht
the last shot at the airport where we see the car  from the side..wow..the wheels are amazing..gorgeous
Nico is still a 'kid' compared to Mate...!!
Beautiful Car Nico hope you have lots of fun with it.
Don’t normally enjoy these hyper car vlogs but this was great. Nico seems like a nice guy. What a car.
Powerful car for sure, but with no engine sound it’s got no soul 😕
AMAZING!!! How about these for Safety Cars in F1?
I can only think of Mate’s insurance broker right now! 🤣
👍
Extremely happy that Mate and Rimac as a company have so much success to date and hopefully much more to come!
Mate didn’t know that there’s a big difference between Richard Hammond and an F1 world champion ☝🏻
Great car, only thing that I noticed is the map. Map is not working properly, specially on the mountain roads with close sharp corners.
The Lotus evaji has the Same Power and weight les
The genuine fear in mates voice 🤣
"like a water pump or something?" Mate trolling AMG One 😂
Love the Spec of the car looks amazing, the only thing I'd change is the polished wheels.
20:50 love that everyone gets shares - super cool !
Piss off with the autonomous driving nonsense. We drive for the love of driving.
Wow what a ride absolutely love it 👌
OUCH...Nico on the AMG One.....
Thanks u to share that to your fan. It’s incredible
Watching this, reminds me of a younger Elon Musk, big comment I know, but he is quite brilliant also. Go hard young man.
Fanastic car.  Would be great if you took it on the Nurburgring.
shouldve shown more pov driving.. incredible
And you just had to choose the most boring color ever
Mate's face when Nico teased him with drifting there ahahaha, and Nico already smiled at him when Mate tried to describe what can go wrong. 🤣😂
kakve prevare AHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
Unique- unbelievable car!!!
The thing that  F1 World Champion who beat LH in equal machinery 2016 buy the best car that exists today in your  country and in your city is Amazing feeling
What a useless car !
Simply Incredible. The visual of it going around the corners is insane! Wow! Charne, an F1 fan in Christchurch, New Zealand 🇳🇿
Amazing RIMAC. Noted though at 13:00 that the GPS has difficulties tracking the car. Maybe a software flaw?
That’s funny, he was going to put it in sport mode, “no, I like track mode” of course he wants track mode. Haha 😂
Awesome car and Mate is also an awesome guy. Would love to see Nico push the car really hard and give the development team feedback on improvments in suspension and drivetrain setup for a "Nico Mode" for example. Probably normal people would not understand or enjoy but for me a techical video like that would be amazing.
👍
@7:45 "No, these guys don't feel sorry." Rich people's arrogance, eh?
Lažibrada
How about a nürburgring lap record :)
Why Matty has been wearing gloves?
Nico: I will touch the car with gloves only. Also Nico: I want to drift here on this public highway exit on my first ride.  😄   Independent of that: Very nice car, very nice video!
Autonomous driving for 'normal' people. 🚩🚩
Quite typical for @nico rosberg to not let other people talk, to interupt and to overule. Just like in the scene with Mate.
Amazing car
Nico wanting to go for a drift.... Mate: Nooooo Nico! No! That's soooo not right! ..... ;-)
Mate is a genius like Elon without the Elon BS.
Making cars only millionaires can buy. Great use of lithium.
I’m new to this chanel, but the presentator looks like that guy who beat lewis Hamilton in equal machinery in 2016. Is that right?
Wow what a car! It is a game changer, I love the way he was terrified 😂 I would trust you world 🌍 champion 🏆
you cant say no to an ex f1 driver who beat lewis in the same machinery
The back looks like a  BMW I8
Nice car.. But the rear end looks a bit like a BMW i8 isn't it? But still a much better interior than a i8.
That awkward laughing after the drift! 😂
3 point seat belt for 2000HP. WTF?
The rear camera POV gave me the biggest smile, watching Nico carve up that road was magic. Thank you.
Mate Rimac dad is a convicted criminal and he started the company with that money
Almost as tight as when you drove that red light with that ferrari in Monaco and had to reverse all the way.
Get it on carwow nico against your championship winning car
I want everybody to think about the arrow in the thumbnail for a second.   Why is it there, what does it tell me - Who's the car?!?    Edit: probably done by the same guy who did these horrible music fade-ins
"nono, i quite like track mode" - Nico 2022
Nico, but you need to admit no matter how fast the car is.... the vw golf is in front to capture everything :D :D :D
Why wouldn’t u put more for sport cause its more then enough 😂😂😂
Nico I thought you were an investor in Rimac, it does not appear to have been mentioned in this video and if you were or are perhaps this should be mentioned.
Is this the guy that beat Lewis Hamilton in Equal machinery circa 2016?
Car seems so solid - great job off all involved, and you are both such nice guys, you should have a tv show hehe
Absolutely beautiful!!
Mate’s expression when Nico wanted to turn off traction control 😂
5:34 - Mate : "I'll just change to Sport Mode" - Nico :"No No I quite like Track Mode" - brilliant! What an amazing machine.
...and just think...I'd be happy with a 200hp Miata/MX-5.  Enjoy Nico, be safe.
Interesting video. Great rapport with Mate.  Nice car too Nico  Get a Tesla S Plaid and do a drag race  the steals Plaid are available in Europe soon  0-60 mph difference is 0.05 sec
Nico you're a madman ! 😂😂 That's some huge ⚽⚽!
Mate is amazing and you have bought definitely the BEST car in the world!
Rico's scientific approach to driving brings the best out of Nevera
What a interesting video!!!
Nico nice to see you in Croatia, did you try to drive his first car the e30 “washing machine” drag car?
True words by a passionate Mate, "these guys don't feel sorry"
The car looks amazing! Mate is an inspiration though, so level headed and idealistic even after all this success. Incredible. Well done all at Rimac.
Nico the narcissists. Congrats.. he didn’t invest in the company that doesn’t surprise me. Just shows if daddy wasn’t a f driver Nico dollar.. Nico must have been going crazy when Hamilton stoke his thunder….
Thanks, Nico. A great introduction to an amazing car. Your reactions, with your experience tell a very compelling story.
Great video. Rimac is amazing, Nico obviously knows his stuff as well. Nice choice of wheels, very tasteful and not so common. Now for the non car related stuff. Where does Nico get those socks? Not mocking, truly interested.
The future of hyper car. Very jelous of you
Really nice car bro Good job  Love it
It is like RIDING THE THUNDER!
Amazing drive with that Nevera, Nico Rosberg! May i gonna drive one?
C'est n'importe quoi cette voiture Rimac lance toujours des offensives sur les médias mais leur voiture ne roule jamais, leur chiffre de puissance est clairement une pure arnaque jamais de mesure sur un banc de puissance autre que le leur et jamais de temps officiel sur un 0-200, Rimac est une arnaque, de plus les rétroviseurs sur l'écran central c'est du n'importe quoi pas pratique du tout
Well done Nico, well done Mate..
Nico smiling all the time.  Mate praying all the time in his mind.   Great guys and congratulations on your success.
Mate just sitting there smiling and thinking what a beast they've made 😁
When a car comes to Monaco, you should return the favor and let the Mika Häkkinen drive it...
monaco-based youtuber driving a hypercar at the same time beating lewis hamilton in the same machinery in 2016
Gorgeous car wow wow wow
The whole time I'm watching this I keep thinking about how Nico passed up on the opportunity to invest in Rimac! 😰
I would pay a million dollars to sit next to Nico on this road
Mate had plastic covers on his shoes and hands. I think he needed one under his ar$e when Nico was joking about trying to drift it!
My new favorite car!.
Can't believe they think Nico is a youtuber
Mega car so cool
I love the blurry speedometer. They should make this feature in every modern car - when you hit the road speed limit the speedo should go blurred just for your safety 🤪😁
Mate you are a wonderful human being. The way you treat your company and your staff, a kind of compassionate capitalism, if I may call it like that ... is really really powerful.
Matt's pant are probably wet. Pun intended
Mama Mia Nico, so happy to see the progress. Sounds ,well maybe not sounds lol like a beast. Must be awesome if it compares or is better than an F1 car😳😳😳👍👍👍👍. Look forward to the Monaco videos👍👍
Nico your best!!!!! Great video!
I like it. I like the rims
The „those guys (Big Company Managers) dont feel sorry“ really got me ! Stay the way you are Mate !
My man just put in a full driving clinic 🏎
"Fun section of the road" - 11:40
" I don't understand. " is a powerful statement. The more so, from an accomplished person like you Nico. How many people BS their way through things ? It takes humility to say that sentence ... it shows vulnerability, willingness to grow and learn. Hats off brother.
Take it around Silverstone and compare lap times to F1.
Beautiful spec Nico. Well done Rimac. Looking forward to seeing what's next.
WOW What you chose was my favourite colour combo. Even the wheels are my taste which at the moment are not on trend with most people going for black wheels.  In Monaco I would like to see Nico in your own car and Mate in the development car with all the electric graphics travelling as much as possible two abreast on the Monaco F1 track. Most scences should be filmed at dusk to highlight the lines on both cars allowing the “bling” from the wheels and the cool led lighting to be extenuated. Good luck with that????😂😂😂 Maybe a quick phone call to Prince Albert and Princess Charlene might do the trick????😂😂😂
11:48 Is it just me or do I see Niko's fingers reaching for the steering wheel paddles, which are not there?
Mate, next time put safety diapers ha ha ha
paint the wing contrast colour. when it flips, it shows!
What does Elon think about it all?
Telling Nico.... ghmm not to drift.. U must be maddd.. ahahah  Nico. "No No.. I like track mode"..
Increíble!!  Saludos desde México
Ist der pünktlich gekommen wie der one?
Best video so far
Such an amazing car
12:40 my man quietly shitting himself lol
Top Video, and respect to Mate for his attitude to the employees with the shares. He also helps Croatia with his doing.
When can we see it actually drifting ?!! :)
That is such an amazing car 😍 Rimac makes us love the future of electric driving. Just p*rn on wheels 😍
I love this car.
This is something on another level❤️
The smile on Nico's face says it all.
"No, no. I quite like Track Mode"! LOL
“ they don’t do sorry” 🫢
The deep respect and teasing between the two guys is so authentic. Kudos to both
Incredible car but give me a stick and sound effects any day.
Keke probably would have smoked that record.
That was amazing🤣😂🤣 when mate praying 🙏starting at 06:25 and Mate know its not a joke its over!! This was a real ''Cheeeese'' from Nico he got evil look😈 and that laughing from Mate it was a real emotion  🤣😂🤣🤣Nico and Mate you need to do more video like that!!!Thx
3:37 - safety car restart mode
He is genius But still I don’t like EV
Fabulous car and an excellent video.  How times have changed. Once Nico looked over throttle traces with his race engineer in an F1 garage, now he can do the same on the outside lane of a freeway in a production car.  And there’s me doing the same checking my oil pressure and water temperature gauges on my old F355 every 2 minutes!
An amazing car and drive. Can't wait to see you drift. The one thing that surprised me is the car is not fitted with 5 point harnesses instead of 3 point seat belts.
Sorry Nico . What I meant to say  was former F1 CHAMPION retirees.
Congratulations Nico! What an amazing car!!!
God bless you guys 👍
Great car and video. But it’s aluminium 😂
Mate is such an icon and an inspiration. 👏
Their chat in the end was juicy. I didn't know that Rimac supplied batteries to big manufacturers and Mate was involved with the Valkyrie.
Are they on blow?
I feel like I could see nico's hands expecting to shift gears like a paddle shifter but then he remembers its electric
What do I think of the car? Fricken amazing and as an ex racer myself I felt that drive. Mate is an amazing man and he deserves all the successes, he will surpass Elon Musk.
Mate seems such a humble , decent and fun guy, especially for someone so smart and presumably rich.
the seat belt looks not fit with the car.
The best car review I’ve ever seen. Such frank and honest commentary from one of the world’s best, praise like that is not easily earned. The Nevera is in a class of it’s own (Hypere car?)
TOO...DAMN...QUIET!!! You're still cool though Nico🤣🤣
Just don’t forget the Mercedes SLS - Four Motors, Torque Vectoring and nothing for show.
Great car and I love the polished aluminum wheels!
Congratulations nico for this beast of a car... It would be very interesting to see your W07 against nevera on Spa or Nurburgring GP layout...
"just trust me"
my car lifts spoiler at 85mph, guess the car?
Really a joy to watch!
Class Nico,  just bought a new Car and leave it behind to catch a plane. 😁😁👍👍. It looks amazing, by the sounds of it the performance and handling is 100%.  Going to be great to see it in more Video. 👍😁
What an amazing vlog by the 2016 Mercedes amg petronas f1 world champion nico rosberg who beat Lewis Hamilton in an equal machinery
Great video; you can see that Mate is wishing that he installed a lot more grab handles in the car. I can also see the pride on his face; you're an amazing guy Mate.
"Nono i quite like track mode" did me in.
Beautiful car
Mate sounds like the absolute dream boss and his company sounds like paradise
I love it!
You can see Niko during his race portion of the video, instinctively going to upshit as if he is in an F1 car, only for there to be no gear paddle there hahahaha. Love this.
Congratulations on your new car!!🥂...It's awesome!👍
cool to see how nico's fingers still upshift during accel
ZMM on the ASX. 99.98% down. Huge investment opportunity?
ZMM on the ASX. 99.5% down. Huge investment opportunity?
Looooooooool love this guy😂😂😂
ZMM on the ASX. 99.5% down. Huge investment opportunity?
You are so bad guy ! Man! Lol!
Mate Rimac seems like a cool dude😁
Fully Electric Garbage 🤮🗑️
I want that car Nico pls buy me just 1 😂
How long can you go full power intill there is no juice left in the batteries? Lol
How much battery left after your trip?
You can tell he was going crazy with the speed because they have blurred it out haha :-D sounds like it is a great car though!
9 seconds to 300. Yeah all I need to know.
Epic
So after almost killing Richard Hammond, he's next target is Nico Rosberg?😅
Mate is extremely intelligent and compassionate.
1:27 what are all those cars, parts: Employee's cars?
He will continue to have humility because he is the soul creator of this beast. His heart is in it. People become arrogant when they are detached from the project.
You really feel his pain when he said "these guys don't do sorry"
next chapter to sell more cars than Toyota
Bone ni video sa shpejtsi ka
Nice get one hot lap in Monaco :) Nice video Congratulations.
I would love an NA hybrid W16 in the next Bugatti. The sound of an NA W16 is melodious.
$2.4 million
Don't want to be a dick but why do people - sophisticated, knowledgeable people at that--have so much trouble pronouncing Rimac properly? So simple: In certain slavic languages "C" is pronounced like "TS" as in tse tse fly. Therefore: REE-MATS!
I’d need diapers to sit with Nico
Revolutionary
No means No respect the decision of others
Alternate title : Man who beat Lewis Hamilton in same machine drives 2000HP supercar for first time
Would love to see this on the nurburgring
That was hilarious, the look on Nico’s face when he said… “you like that you can’t put the power down?”😳
No No i like track mode haha
Incredible car, but the fact that you were testing it in public roads is wrong. Test it on track, don't put people at risk.
I’ll be honest, I’m not a fan of the look of the car. It doesn’t reflect its performance. Everything else is 10/10 though.
How can they say they are number 1 in hypercars? It has acceleration but the car is extremely heavy giving it bad dynamics, low top speed compared to competition, longer brake distance etc.
Looks like it is just sticking in the corners.  Was it heavy on the turns or did it only look like it. I love the wide stance of the car, I mean I never could ever afford it but I would love to see some more trips with it - hieno auto
The man is humble & Rimac has a great future … congrats on both the car & the 1st delivery :)
Masterpiece
Masterpiece
Take a shot every time Nico says "insane." I'm toast.
That was one of the most enjoyable videos I have ever watched. Loved every second. As a guy, there's nothing like picking-up and enjoying a new car, much less a production Rimac Nevera. Definitely gonna be watching this a few times. Thanks Nico!
That's the way of management , you can see the progress and beauty of humanity Ty Nico,so cool The car actually is a beast and can manage everything but I look forward to see drifting
This video is so genuine. Thank you Nico, for being so organic and true to yourself. Mate is cool too. I think you can get him a double cappucino ?
Thats so cringe that he wears plastic shoe protectors because he "likes to take care of his car" 🤡🤡 still a decent. Video though.
I really love that a young dude has come and turned the car industry on it's head! Brilliant.
The CEO has to change his underwear after every video with Nico
I just realised the guy's name is Mate. At first I thought every other comment were Aussies referring to him as "mate" lel
Hi Nico. Glad to hear you have become a YouTuber. Maybe you can get some other F1 retirees like Kimi and Seb also involved.
the rimac bugatti will be history
NO NO NO , RICO, you have to get used to the  CAR!!
What is the range on this beautiful beast !?!
NICO, bitte, official Nürburgring nordschleife... (universal auto-motive language right there)  It's been more than enough time, I need to go pee already!!!!!!!
Came for the car review. Stayed for the surprisingly good podcast.
Chapter 2 = electric space travel
Wow what a machine
A driver of this caliber and an engineer of this caliber in a car of this caliber. Wow, this is something special.
Nico is quite obviously a fake-ass ego-maniac
Looks like the new Corvette
Nico shd stay as a consultant for the next Rimac n Bugatti car as the future is very bright.
Very enjoyable to be there with you guys, thanks for the ride!
Gorgeous car!
To hear Mate say that he loves the Valkyrie and LaFerrari is amazing. And it makes me very optimistic about the future of Bugatti.
2+mil.vehicle which dont have automatic pilot,parking,night drive,other gadgets which have 20x cheaper cars which are actually cars for long range everyday driving
MALO NAS JE ALLL NAS IMA....
When Nico joked about going race mode he got that Richard Hammond memories
90% of peoples made more mileage with foot yearly then Nico and similar with this vehicle yearly and  what is more interesting this vehicle will come slower on destination of 200+km away then some 5000 euro worth car of 120-150hp
“these guys don’t feel sorry” 😂😂
Where is Nurburgring time !? somebody afraid to go there
Great video!
More like this Nico
Mate's balls sweating...haha
I’d like to see nicos car collection
Super beautiful car!!!! Amazing!!!👍🏻👍🏻
A: Such a great off the cuff interview B: I grew up near a touristy mountain town …where at the time the Contach poster was on everyone’s wall …an entrepreneurially motivated guy bought one and charged $$$ to take the public on lil rides  … seeing the joy and expression on the two of your faces makes me believe the Nevera is on that level of a dream vehicle experience…even more so!!
Amazing.
Nevera - Refrigerator in Spanish. But you knew that already.
✨🌟✨🙌🏽✨🌟✨🥰
Wow fantastic Video. Beautiful car.
Nico's finger's muscle reflexes looks like they're automatically changing gears on a paddle shift.. haha I guess thats what F1 champs are built like
Hey dude do you have a notion of timing ?
that car should be on a poster above my bed.
Incredible job 👍🏻
just me or the tail light looks like a bit of i8 tail light ?
Best video ever on this channel!
Personally, I like carbon fiber.
When you hear an F1 driver go whoaaaaah you know its gonna rip your face off :D
Nico, that is such a beautiful piece of sculptured artwork on wheels. Definitely something I would dream of. Congratulations, please do some more videos about it.
Using shoe cover because you "take care" of THINGS. Welcome to  2022, where things are worshiped instead of real values.
Warum haben sich die Beiden nicht auf Deutsch Unterhalten? Beide sind doch in Deutschland Aufgewachsen!
Such a copy cat at 21:10 question, he took from Tesla and Elon, just don't have balls to admit it. Only fools pay 2 milj for this, even so car does perform incredible.
Amazing car ! Great guy refreshing busines view
That exit path looks expensive from any angle..
Great video. Incredible car. Love the amount of info that was shared. Thank you for this.
I would love to see you take the car to a track
6:31 for ‘drift’
Brilliant video🇦🇺
battery on wheels
Nico: insane...insane.. Mate: insane...Nico insane...
Nurb we go!
This car should be the next Bruce Wayne's car
Another Battery Chicken without any Emotions at all... We will look back and say: ....
Mate is almost like the electric car equivalent to Christian Von Koenigsegg and I love it
mate mijenja boje ko flomaster
WOW AMAZING and  Mate  REALLY REPRESENT  GREAT HUMBLE  GUY  GOOD LUCK CHAMP
You can tell that the car is Croatian just by the ground clearance
Deffinitely a dream car!!!!
NICE  AWES0ME KEEP_IT_UP! ✨🎉✨🎉✨🎉🎉🎎🎭🎎🎭🎎🎭🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎗🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑🎑✨🎆🎆
Mate was nervous he would experience a Hammond
I still dont understand is the car electric or motor?
Thank you Nico
Makes sense that the Rimac brand will be dissolved and the tech will be integrated into Bugatti, which has done the hard yards in the mass market for branding prestige already.
I would never get nervous having a F1 champion driving fast , I would be like SEND IT Bro 😅
Absolutely insane car and Mate is a gem
Rimacaroni and Cheese
Mate has PTSD from Nico...on the thing he loves most in life performance cars! Doh.   Mega congrats again Nico...I hope you an Mate do more videos, you guys together make awesome videos.
is that nico rosberg the guy who beat lewis hamilton 7 time world champion in equal machinary
The GPS cannot follow Nico XD
Nico's smile at 6:13, you can clearly see that he was testing Matte on purpose
Did he struggle getting in the car at the beginning?  If so I’d never fit in there.
5:30 "Maybe go back to sport mode" "No no I quite like track mode" 😂
Mate need to have real time heart rate meter. This will be interesting-)))
This is Mate's first job and he no longer takes a salary... impressive.
Just a couple awesome fellas in a machine at the apogee of engineering.   I hope a guy like Mate see’s the potential in making or partnering with a manufacturer that will produce a car with 1/6 the power and 10x the range with all the fun you can ask for up to ~130mph.  Someone needs to give Tesla a run for their money on design and functionality.  Even if it just starts with the requisite components.
This CEO ist simply inspirating. How can you ever not like this dude.
Yeah ….. yeah…… yeah ….. Nico you are funny and we enjoy watching you 😃
only drivers like this should be allowed to drive this car, how long before we see some mad Arab wrap one round a tree ?
I love the camera lens making their hands commically large! xD With the white gloves, Matte looks like Mickey Mouse!  Also, great car, congrats to both.
20:55 this sir is exactly why you are ready for chapter 2. Thank you for sharing!
Mate truly is an amazing CEO. The type that makes you willing to invest in the man even before knowing about the company.
Acceleration is not what F1 cars are primarily designed for…
Not sure if this is a compliment or not, but I didnt really like you in F1, but I love your youtube channel. Keep it up Nico.
The car is so amazing and i can't wait for more. Great video,  You and Mate are so fantastic and passionate, i was smiling whole video. I hope we won't wait to long for next part, maybe on the track this time.
So casual so amazing! Like you drive an amazing sports car all the time.
Mate seems like the kind of boss you want to spend a career working for.
You are an amazing person, i want to say only that. Thank you! Greece loves you!
I love how Maté builds these wild machines in his head and with supreme engineering, then jumps in the passenger seat and realizes what he's built while his body may not be ready for it hahah. What a guy! Soo inspirational..
That Rimac is just beautiful
People need to learn to pronounce it correctly as 'Rimats' not 'Rimak'
Mate sounds like an incredibly nice down to earth guy, you can tell he’s an engineer through and through and those types of car bosses produce better cars, accountants do not!
Both of you are quite inspirational. Mate's response to your compliment could've remained with him, but he mentioned his team.  Nico, I have a few ideas about how you could use this car for future projects to encourage businesses to invest in EV, and to look at new opportunities for small businesses
Beautiful vid, stunning car.
Love the way Mate runs his company. Everyone has a stake in the company.
LOL!!! "Way too much traction control.....(click click)...Why you have so much traction control in this mode?"......:D Because not everyone is an F1 driver Nico.....:D
6:34 Mate haven't fully grasped that F1 drivers are a different kind of breed 🤣 PRICELESS!!!
Feel free to buy me one.
Ultimate followup short to this awesome video: Matt Watson “here’s five annoying things about this car” 🤣
Nice. If only....
Mate is a "light cool guy". Looks like a brazilian! lol  In fact when I started knowing him and his company, even considering his accent, it was not easy to believe he was european. If european, maybe from Portugal, for instance... A very humble successful man. As a engineer I am, I have a great admiration for him. For Musk too, but in a very different way...
totally crazy but the future is here
Kudos for putting your faith in Mate. I think we all want to see your next video with the Nevera :)
Two of my favorite men on the planet…(non-transition, full hormonal male)  :-)

"These guys don't feel sorry"
We can't tell when you're accellerating ... except for your childish grins :)
Absolutely amazing Nico and thank you Mate for bringing to us this wonderful environmentally friendly future!!! Now please make one for the less wealthy and less privileged people, like when you put a washing machine motor in the green/white 3 series BMW!
Nico, money aside and the fact that this is your car but Mates face sais it all. Do not crash MY baby. :)
AMAZING...the hole car and the story of him!
What about battery? After riding how much battery has left?
You gotta trust a world champion in equal machinery
This car epitomizes Mate. What a man. The ending of the drive where he spoke about his life, how he doesn't have the highest pay grade in his company and wanted to work for free for Bugatti Rimac... wow. He deserves nothing but the best man.
I love how they censored speedometer 😂 bcs let’s be real noone is going to drive 2000hp car 30km/h around. Especially not guy that beat 8 time world champion in same machinery.
Huge congratulations Nico, well done
Funny how Nico tousled the CEO of Bugatti Rimac and see his reaction
Meine persönliche Meinung ist, das sich Nico Rosberg sehr sehr gefreut hatt über seinen Rimac Nevera. Darüber hinaus ist es immer schön und einzigartiges Erlebnis seinen PKW , Wagen was auch immer für ein Gefährt , man auch bestellt hatt, Neu Abzuholen. Akustisch ist der Wagen angenehm ruhig im Innenraum. Nico gab Mate auch zuvor seinen Eindruck und Tips zu Dingen , durch seine Erfahrung als Formel Eins Pilot und die damit einhergehende Erfahrung. Schöne Aufnahmen aus Kroatien. Allseits Gute Fahrt auch in Monaco !!!
I would have thrown up after 2 minutes of that
😊❤️🪬🪬🪬💯 OMG❤️🙏🪬💯
I was here when the best youtube video uploaded.Cheers both of you
No rev limiter 👍😅
His afraid of your driving, am I right? Nice guy cool car is it as fast as Koenigsegg's One car? I like the video but more camera on the dashboard, just something I noticed missing & no offence. It looks like a car that can manage both road & track equally as well as it looks. It looks great inside & out. Happy driving & stay safe, Nico👌👍💚
If Mr Mate and Mr Konigsegg ever build a car together.. that would be something to behold !
¨This is my first job, I didn´t do anything else before¨........ And then he builds Rimac from the ground up to what it is today, starting when he was 20!!!  😱😱😱Dafuk? Besides (obviously) being a genius, Matte is a shrewd business man, passionate, a true visionary; and a great leader all at once. That is....RARE. I truly wish him & the company ALL the success deserved.   Nico: good on you to trust this young lad with your money; and now being able to smile as much as you did driving the final product. You must have been an integral part of putting Rimac on the map to success, and I applaud your for that.

I love Nico he is hilarious had me cracking up.
champ please pronounce Rimac right not Rimak it sounds unattractive from PR perspective and people, potential customer would look after you like example
Bravo Mate, svaka čast i da ti Bog zdravlja i sriće! Dobro si izdrža Nikovu "vožnjicu" ;) samo jako, samo naprid!
Nico: "why dont you put more on the sport?" Mate: "because its enough!!!"  🤣🤣
Nico - why is there so much traction control on? Mate-- ......because I'm scared...
Mates’ reaction and the look on his face when Nico suggested drifting....priceless😂🤣😂
What an incredible machine ! Congrats Nico !
Mate suddenly went super SILENT 🤐 LOL 😂😂😂
Mate Rimac is the real Elon Musk!
Anti vax
No noises = boring. Yeah I’m person it’ll be a blast but just watching a video of you going straight isn’t showing any power unless your gonna go super fast in a short amount of time.
Ah yes, this is the famous "Monaco-based YouTuber" I've been hearing about.
Quiero que hagas algunos tiempos de vuelta en pistas como referencia
Would love to check one of these out and such an incredible car.  Seems like a great company to work for too.   Thanks for sharing.
Boring dude🥱
Mate Rimac: "...These guys don't feel sorry..." 😂
How could you give a thumbs down to this car?
AMAZING
You never know how dreams are coming true or what it would take and who would even dream about it 20 years ago??? Sometimes it's good to share ideas and then they might become a project's. I was today in middle of 5 black parked car's and heat from those cars and air temperature was unbearable so i don't understand black color on car's it's still helping with global warming in my opinion? Humans are destroying this planet every possible way???
Nico. Congratulations on getting this car. It's been a while since I've been excited to watch a YouTube video. The car is incredible. Mate Rimac your cars are the future. Beautiful car.
Rimac was genuinely scared. Lulz.
Awesome video with the best 👍👍Rimac Nevera will change the world of automobile ✅✅
Nico, you must do more content with Mate.  Even if you drop for a visit in 6 months! Plus we must see more of the navera!!! Congrats
Fabulous video! Glade Mate didn't need a barf bag lol
Omg. I love that guys mentality. What a great ceo. World needs more people like him.
don't let richard hammond get hold of it
Awesome 👌 beautiful car
Decadence and conspicuous consumption… as a hyper consumer you are also a hypocrite… you lead an unsustainable lifestyle which murders the earth! No kidding… you are a playboy not an activist… what a yoke!💚😇✌️ ps… yr hyper yacht  🛥 is downright tacky… not even worth talking about… the silly things that own you…
Nico trashing the Project One 😂😂
Nevera means "fridge" in Spanish
come on Nico, why running if your pilot is in your plane waiting for you???
Thx Nico and Congrats to You and Rimac for innovating, building, buying, driving and sharing such a hypercare for real with us 😳
🤣🤣🤣 look at him flapping it
Such an amazing car, give us a video of it on an f1 gp track and compare the times!!!!!
This is not a nice thing to do  He was scared and you just didn't care, and this wasn't even the first time...  He's too polite because he can't get angry at you because that would attract a lot of hate and negativity on him, that so sad, and you are taking advantage of that... This is just sad and upsetting, I know how he's probably feeling
“Richard Hammond flashbacks intensifying” -Mate
What an amazing car. I love that it is quicker (probably) than a F1 car. That’s a kind of milestone for production cars. Enjoy Nico. Ps: Maybe have a camera giving a closer POV next time. Cheers, fascinating video.
Bravo Nico. Najbolji auto i idi uz najboljeg vozača. Pozdrav iz Podgorice  (Montenegro🇲🇪)
Guys please. This is a F1 World Champion Driver. This is not some YouTube clown talking like they know cars. That’s how impressive this car is. To get a reaction from a world class F1 Driver like this, shows how special this car is.
Was that owner who crashed his car Nico Rosberg the same F1 driver who beat lewis Hamilton in equal machinery? No
Anybody knows the song? Fits awesomly
I would be homeless if i bought this car,  unless i live in it. Hopefully any passengers won't mind the BO.
Imagine having a world champion F1 driver singing high praises of a car that you built... 🤯
Is there any backstory about Mate? I mean, the guy looks pretty young to be the founder and CEO of such a relatively big company.
Where was that mountain road, looks very nice
Can I pppppllleeaassseee buy one?
I'm a big fan of both of you, but please consider that you constantly exceed the speed limit, once it was directly visible (84 where 50 was allowed) and I don't want to know what the maximum speeding was - but you have to know that Croatia still struggles with corruption and people get additionally disappointed by the authorities if they see that people like you easily get away with it. Still a big fan though of both of you!
I love the car and it must be very, very good judging by Nico's reactions. I loved the conversation about Keke, one of the true greats. Mate is a true inspiration.
nice car guys!!! Congrats for getting it Nico!  Aber als kleiner Hnweis, die Karte hat einige Male fehlerhafte Sachen angezeigt.  Ansonsten liebe Grüße und viel Spaß mit dem Schmuckstück!
What a nice person! both of you!
Looks like a BMW i8 from the back
Nico has a great personality. He makes passengers very stiff.
The car seems as advertised and any owner testing with builder is a perfect video. So what actually have you recommended in the heat exchange department? Encourage him to take a salary because the volatile nature of the economy of the future will cause him to regret his current convictions.
Mate just wont to live 🤣 and make more cars👍
Wow, what a car! And here I was excited about my Model Y P that will arrive some time this winter. Not that exciting anymore :P
electric cars...... perhaps for gays... 😂😂
7:46 "These guys don't feel sorry" 😂
Perfect match, F1 driver fit’s perfect to Nevera 👌🏽
You have to film the road when you’re accelerating!
Nico basically did a SpongeBob "Floor It?" to Mate. That was glorious.
Imagine rimac joining formula E 😳...i would finally follow it as a fellow croatian
20:11 Wow so much great insight . What an inspired and Randian company philosophy. I just dig the logic and how he let's everyone win. Love love. Cheers from Florida by way of Slovenia.
Epic drive
This guy is amazing!
Nice video 🔥
Amazing vid, I wish more yt vids were like this - frank talk with lots of details!
This was a good dose of a video. Some of your previous videos were too short. And good to see you finally mention your AMG One using your F1 engine parts. Had a troll long ago not agreeing & asking for proof.
Mate is already a legend!
This car is amazing!!!
Mad mad respect for Mate such a nice and humble human being and they way he have that gratitude towards everything, and Ofc Nice you are a gem  Such an awesome video and congratulations for your New Ride  Cheersss…
"....no, these guys dont feel sorry" 😂
Diese Felgen sind sooo geil 😍
I really enjoyed this video, and Nico comes across as a genuine guy too.
This video was AWESOME!!!!
This is amazing achievement for a person who defeated 7 time world champion in equal machinery!! 👏👏👏
Nico! Time to call Matt at Carwow and race against Coultard's F1! Im so looking forward to it!
Absolutely a nice car Nico!!
LUL faster than F1. beat that F1!
Good video from the monaco based YouTuber who did beat lewis in 2016 in the same machinery
monaco based youtuber
Mate should sue you for "Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress".
So... if he see's another driver in the same car he'll drive into it yes?
Or maybe a drift battle with Mate in two Neveras😃
What a car! Gorgeous! And in good hands, with someone who can appreciate such amazing machinery/speed/quality! Fantastic!
We Luv it!
Too bad the car isn't all that attractive. The tech seems so good.
Totally amazing Nico what a fantastic car 👍👍
Fantastic car and the owner and Rimac! Greetings from Zadar
Drift battle Nevera vs Project One🔥
Mate auch an amazing person
R&R limited Edition, Rimac Rosberg, i saw it alredy... Rimac techonology, Rosberg driving skils,best car ever
wow nico's comments on the car really mean something, rimac is incredible
You can’t not love mate, such a nice guy and a thru carguy
🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷
cool, a $2.5 million hypercar that looks crap and sounds even worse lol
What brand is it?
Congradulation nico...
Noticed they were not shouting or anything. Refinement is top notch, for a new relatively new carmaker that’s impressive. That Bugatti alliance coming through!
Mate: "let's go back to sports mode"  Nico: "nah nah I quite like track mode"  Mate: "😕"
Nico: everything ok?  Mate: yeah.. yeah.. pants are still dry  😂😂
Censors the color of his amg1 Also forgets to censor “i ordered mine in red aswell”
all my thumbs up
Nico sure knows how to present a video! Loved his straight up questions, plus, no hesitation to push! Really a great video 😁 The Rimac (and the boss) really seems incredibly cool.
Good job Mate
amazing car well deserve  and amazing interview! ...Quick q how is the nevera compared to the other hypercars you have driven?
Nico you seem a nice guy but most people are struggling to keep a roof over their heads. Not interested in spoilt man toys, not said out of jealousy just speaking the truth.
Before you say anything about Mate being scared, remember this car has more than 1900 hp and 2360 nm of tourqe, that is insane and Nico needs to understand how this care behave remeber what happend to Hammond he pushed car to much in the bend, Mate really wants everything to be good because this is the first car that he deliverd
Hes right i have as a moto gp racer enjoy driving good downforce years F1 cars....but the first thing i noticed with an F1 car is under 100mph full throttle just smokes the tires because the weight is so little u have to work the throttle under 100 mph once after90moh second gear full throttle is okay  no more check up on the gas pedal...nail it an go at 90 an above exvept canada molson gp
13:58 did he puke?
Is this the Monaco youtuber Top Gear magazine were talking about?
Mate n.1
Nico says "Mate hold my beer"  id be ok with that
Man this is the future, best sports car ever, like McLaren f1 in his time!
Top Speed. Up Up
Is it a pre-requisite to have been a world F1 champ to own/drive one of these? Lord help us if it's not. (I still want one...). 🙂
🪙
Awesome video Nico!
This was the best choice! Amazing car, very sharp and passionate people behind it. What I admire about Rimac, he is down to earth person. He is the perfect leader for his people.
Having a people in the company without a structure will be a big challenge. I believe it is manageable until a certain point. I really wish it will work for Rimac. Mate is Elon Musk from Balkan. Distributing shares to employees is also how it should be 👍 Great video as always :)
This one is one of the hilarious video I've seen on this channel good job Nico
As always a pleasure to watch your videos and listen to your commentary and opinions, both of you are so down to earth when you speak even though you are both man of success.   Also, glad to see someone in a car like this and being a proper driver and not just a "wanna be a racing driver because I have the money".
This car is amazing!
Nico, you are the legend! And the way you still ejoy, it is joy to look
fantastic car..and a fantastic person. he is very likeable..i wish him all luck with his ventures
I want to see you give it everything it’s got nico. It’s amazing
Mate is the person people think that other electric car CEO is. Such an impressive, moral, upstanding guy.
“Because I want everybody to feel it’s not Mate’s comapny, it’s my company”.   ❤️ very thoughtful & insightful, this a true leadership quality.
You know what to do with your money and your 2000hp supercar...
I pretty much liked Nico's thoughts about the AMG One 🫣😎 On top of that it is so ugly 🤢
Such a nice sculpture
Holy S what a cool car! And the dude next to you so cool , he will get there.
Of course the engineering and mechanical work is genius, but the styling OHHHH the styling looks so bland.  :(. They should have hired Pininfarina.
Nice car bro, I wish I got a job a rimec
Im italian superb job on the looks beautifull styling an design....i like i like
Nice ride, congrats Nico
Please don’t let Richard Hammond drive it …
Shoe protectors lol.
Race something!
Especially with the way we will be driving... 00:50 What???🤣🤣🤣🤣
Well, that's an awful life you have 🤣 Seriously, love the car and Mate Rimac seems like a really down to earth, passionate guy. Congratulations on the purchase. 👍
It hard to sit here with turbo or screaming engine an feel by watching that how fast they are going
Hey Mr Nico how do you feel to have a car that is more than twice the power than the car you used to race?...
✌️🔝❤️🇭🇷🤩
Love this car! It motivates me to study for my mechanical engineering exams in university  More content please, but still thank you for this one!
There's only one thing missing in this car, a panic button 🤣  Bravo Mate, congrats Nico!
Mate is really the better Elon Musk.
Such a fun video. These guys are both so charismatic and great to listen to. Huge respect to both Nico and Mate. We need more guys like this in motorsport. The future is electric ⚡️
Nico OLAF will gladly take your opinion on this fraudster
F1 champ driving the fastest production car on Earth, wow!
Nico 🙏🏻don’t  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Best.  Congrats Mate and Nico.
Love it!
6:47 sus
I dont think i can ride with Nico as a passenger he drives tooo much like me...i drive ride to the edge....an have never been a good passenger all wheel drive
I'd like to let you know what I think of the car, however that would require a ride. I am available most times. When can I expect your call?
Best part ALL EMPLOYEES HAVE SHARES
Well that's fine! Mate Rimac and his approach to the world around us suit me very well. I am happy with the company's success. What's the next step? Probably another hypercar? Hmmmm that's obvious. I can not wait. How beautiful would it be if an ordinary person could experience your technology in an ordinary car? So I wish you the development of the company and the achievement of the moment that will be the beginning of the production of cars for ordinary people. I challenge it not to be too easy before I die.
The start already got me. Very nice man
The Car is incredible. Well done Maté, he's a genius...except when it comes to colour choice😉 I agree that naked Carbon Fibre as an exterior would look awful, almost like it is unfinished.
Let's get back to sport mode... No, I like the track mode.🤘🤣🤣🤣. You're an absolute legend Nico!!
JAJAJAJAJAJAJA TRUST ME REALLY TRUST ME. NICO NONONONO
Incredible car, looks amazing in this blackout paint scheme with chrome wheels
Amazing amazing car Niko..have fun
7:45 these guys don't feel sorry. Bruh
It looks like a Mclaren. Very beautiful
Mate's story about all employed having a part in the company is really inspiring. That is the next level, I hope this will become part of the general business in the future.
The coolest car ever made. That's it.
my  fault  buddy
Nico, I believe there is a faster car than this. 3000HP - 12000rpm - 0-100km 1.8sec - TOP SPEED 500km/h - 14.4 million $
Very good Car but damm i miss the sound of combustion engine... Always feel someting is missing
Mate Rimac. Good man indeed. Thank you.
Love it! Who said Electric Vehicles would make driving boring and every car would be the same skateboard? Proof positive that EVs take the driving experience to the next level AND reduce carbon emissions.
Gorgeous, Nico, congrats! And excellent chat, admire even more!
I have a pagan hundrai for sale for 350k
Look at 24:18
haha..man makes a supercar...but dont like driving fast.....lol arh ok driving fast with others
Rimac the best!!! Živio Mate, Živio Nico
SRB how  fast is it //
Love these videos. The interaction with you and mate is inspiring.
What a car. Love hearing you talk about the handling. Also I agree no on carbon for the outside of the car. The wheels and the color of your care are really incredible. As a former car detailer. Detailing that paint would be incredible it’s such a beautiful, deep, and rich color. Great video Nico and amazing car!
@5:30 "go back to sport mode?" Nico - "no, I like track mode" Haha, always full power.
Hypercar driven by a person who won championship against lewis on same machinery and now he is a youtuber🤣
Good man Nico, using the car what it’s built for fantastic 👍
Awesome!!
Badass
What a car! 🥰👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🇪🇺🇺🇦🕊️
The drive up the hill had even me sweating!!! Wow, amazing car, and I love both of your personalities. Great video, thank you!
The only thing that worries me is if you put all these new cars them in a row   They all look the same but I do love the power 🔋
Not usually a fan Nico, but this channel is making me change my mind
Wow! The way he thinks/speaks about his company and his  team…and such an incredibly nice product… this is the place where I’d love to work!!
Congrats on your car delivery! Not to break any records but... Nurburgring, WHEN? Also, the way Mate talks about Rimac, and the strategy behind shares etc, made even me, a viewer, feel special about the company. The video was very informative and hilarious!
24 minutes in change of comfort for the inventor.
it's so uniqe to see a CEO being this down to earth. you can still hear that he is talking like a ''normal'' human being, and not some elegant snob. I really hope Matte keeps this humble and light personality.
Can we have a show were mate and nico drive hypercars, offraod cars and other crazy stuff  together and mess around. I love the combo. That would be great hahaha
Amazing video . You guys talked about everything rimac is killing it
Awesome!
Car looks insane
Scusa ma Elektro Hypercar = 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Nice Drama !! Car to enjoy.. Seems like they are the only ones that took street legar electric cars to enother level!
Laaaaaagweilig ! kennt noch nicht mal den UUnterschied zwischen Sicht und KonstruktionsCarbon....
Tesla and Musk aren’t in a good position now but the sky is the limit for Rimac
as you'd say "proper WOW".
As soon as he talked about drifting, I immediately like the video 😂😂😂😂
Fantastic to see you driving this car Nico! It's great to get your impressions of this car as an F1 driver
I guess Elon inspired him to do that (not taking salary, stock options) 🙂.  great car bro, big fan wishing you the best in the future Rimac
I really really like his management style. Wanting everyone to own shares and regard it as their company. Really good culture. The car is cool too.
Rimac 👍🏻 ❤ 🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷🇭🇷
Unreal technology . Enjoy Nico , thanks for giving us a look inside. 👍
Nico your new car is dope!
23:50 Mates face after Nico asks that question 😂😂
Monaco based youtuber drives Rimac
Cant wait for chapter 2. Love when these guys meet and make videos, 2 of my heroes really.
nice car Nico
Monaco based youtuber
Kaje Ivanisevic usro si se? 😂
13:00 even the navigation can't keep up with Rosberg 🙈
21:04 Mate Rimac:I want everyone to own a share from this company Nico: Who inspired you to do that?  Me: Marx?
Mate, if you read this, check out Zenseact, perfect match for chapter 2, and culturally a perfekt fit between companies! Br. D.K
This was one of the best and honest drive reviews, it was at the same time an incredible interview with the man behind his first job ever!
Mate was absolutely shitting himself on the windy roads 🤣
NEVERA CROATIA RIMAC GENIUS
It is a dream.
It is a dream .
"I can drift the car no problem, after all... I beat Lewis Hamilton the 7 time Formula 1 WDC in the same machinery."
We’ll deserved Nico, I hope you enjoy the beautiful car! Please DO NOT crash it 🤗😫
Mates attitude to running a company should be adopted from CEO’s of every major company around the world. That’s real progress rather than shitting on the people that made the company a success to begin with. His cleaners to directors are share holders. That creates loyalty. Massive respect not to mention a great video. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This is just 100%  an advert for Rimac   .  I' m sure they are fine cars , but can you  afford one   ??
Great conversation.
How can we get a Nevera as an F1 safety car?
its was so funny to watch Mate being your copilot to get out of the building :)
I can't hear the engine, thats 0 points from me
"just for the drama" I really love this guy, pls continue to make us having fun ;)
That intro
He makes a 2000hp hyper car and is scared to go fast! Even with a race driver 0_0
If Nico says and repeats that the car is insane 6 x in a row; then I'm sold. This must be a heck of a car!
F1 track if possibly
Awesome Nico. GREAT CAR
This has to be one of the best looking cars out there right now!! All the best to Mate on his next chapter.. enjoyed watching his reactions in the car.. LOL!! Great video with great conversation!! Thanks a bunch Nico!!
Glad to see this video, as an engineer who participated in the development it is a pleasure to see that your work actually went into production. Congrats to all engineers who went involved, amazing success to everyone!
Something tells me they will not have retention issues with that management style.. bug kudos!  I agree 100% of employees holding stock.
Mate shat his pants xD
Mate is like the actual good Elon Musk and the real Tony Stark.  his view on management and the "everyone owns a part of the company" philosophy just tells that logical thinking is the number one priority, unlike normal ceo's who just wants to profit
Mate ne dobija ni 10% paznje od svijeta za automobil koji je napravio,remek djelo kojeg se veliki proizvodjaci sigurno stide,svaka cast mate,samo naprijed
Mate: Let put in back in Sport Mode. Niko: oh NO I like the Track Mode 🤣
Why the GoPro's, didn't Rimac said this car has so many cameras integrated so that it creates movie clips for social media on its own? 😂
WoW
No no no
What a Car. Hats off to RIMAC and congrats Nico.
Great Car. However, I like the concept 1 Styling more.
Don’t let Richard Hammond drive it
They crash and get injured they'll just get the body parts and organs that they need from their clone on the Island. If you know you know.
Say hi to the most humble CEO!
Rimac All-Terrain vehicle is a must!!!
I own a Plaid S with 1k HP that is absolutely insane in the canyons. I can't even imagine what the Nevera feels like. Congrats Nico, very cool.
"British Racing Green", in case anyone was wondering
With fires in France, Spain Portugal, and more, droughts etc etc. It's important to know about someone's 2000 hp car. Has Rosberg just come to showing off on you tube
: Nico what will be your dream car to drive and own(some time ago) -  an EV hypercar! :  what? -  Yes!     😁👍
Great Video! Two very cool, funny and professional guys!
What is the range of these rimacs?
Awesome car from awesome company. 👌
what an incredible person Mate is!! Nothing but utmost respect for him! Inspiration through character! 👏
When Mr RImac takes a... well, not a scared look - but a serious look in the speedo - it shows Nico has really given it some beans on the narrow roads. Well done - keep up the good work, Rimac! Amazing video, greetings from Latvia.
Who give's a FK?
Navigation needs some improvement. Was really struggling at 13:00
It seems to be amazing 👍
Too much play in steering.
Gorgeous.
How many millions of USDT did you manage to buy this car for?
I like how Nico always tries to shift the gears after he accelerated. 😂😂 Look at his right hand.
He is transparent? Not with his pricelist
Name of the song at the end? please,thank you
Oh you beauty!   Nice car too
13:00 the map navigation needs some work
Did you know he beat Hamilton in equal machinery?
Poor thing! Mate looks equally terrified and thrilled. ;)
Nico, cool AF 😎 " ...... pants still dry lol "
The smile on your face said it all nice to see a hyper car driven by someone who knows what his doing well done Nico
Mate Rimac's personality and what he and his team of engineers have done will be recorded in the pages of the automotive industry. American dream in Croatia. Nico and his emotions say enough to notice that the mission has been accomplished. And this is only the beginning of the adventure.
What an amazing guy Mate Rimac is! Comes across as very involved and genuine. Also cool to hear you two talk about other hypercars. It is clear there is a passion for cars with no bias towards a certain brand.
and Next? buy a new pair of pants for mate
Ohhh,  ! You should drift him Nico.  What a shame. ... he would never forget,
so I want to see this one against a tesla plaid.. because my bet is that a plaid will be faster to 60 .. just a hunch.
Drift er
NO means NO, Nico...
The car stunning 😍
Real bad driving - senseless speeding. You can also see insane acceleration with every toy car. There is no sense to put that nonsense on the streets.
F1 prvak se vozi kroz hrvatsku sa hrvatskim autom!!!!
Amazing car, great video , seeing Mate nervous as Nico drives is a bonus!
Nico, just teach me to drive like you!
Nico slating merc at any possible moment
Brutal🔥🔥🔥🔥
Question of the day, LOL!  If both of you are catching a flight who is taking the car, long term parking?
6:24 I thought he said "brate" which means "bro" in croatian/serbian
So funny to compare Nico's relaxed smile to Mate's ... well ... not so relaxed one. 😃😅
Nevera is CRAZY‼️Mate is NUTS‼️ Rimac is INSANE‼️
Just effing incredible, amazing, unreal. I’m sooo jealous !! I want one.
Stunning car. Health to enjoy it nico 🤘🏻 best from Ireland.
Fantastic content - super classy and hugely inspiring. Human experience and achievement on a very special scale. The car is as insanely impressive as its creator. However they both are a logical outcome of fearless progression - no self or societal imposed restrictions. Nico, thank you so much for making these unique moments accessible for us mortals. Congratulations Mate!!! The world needs more people like you👍
What a cool guy!
Love how you grilled the AMG One! Totally agree the announced stats are unacceptably low for a hypercar that took 7 years to make. Glad you enjoyed the Rimac.
Just so busy you both barely could not feel the excitement of 2000 Horsepower…now I think every Aston Martin DB7 to Bugatti Atlantic to Mercedes SLS to Mercedes 300SL to Mercedes SLR Should get a Restomod version with 2000 Horsepower…but for the SLK of my wife 500 electric Horsepower is enough…a 500 Hp Restomod Kit for some interesting Restomod Racers like 1968 Dodge Charger and 1967 Mercury Cougar from Mate Rimac would be the most wanted thing for everyone ! Build your own dream Car ! Which one would you build Nico Rosberg ?
13:25 - Mate, "That was.... oohhhh" - Hilarious!  Magnificent car. Brilliant philosophy for the company. Congratulations to everyone.
Funny to See that The Navigation is Not working so well… 12:57
10:01 why not, would be cool if the first female F1 champion worked be a Rosberg, no?
12:34 clearly blurring out the passenger speedometer to get out of any fine. Cheeky move by the production team Nico 🤣🔥🔥
Is ir hybrid or full electric?
Nico Rosberg ich hoffe dir heben die Strassen auserhalb von Zagreb gefallen. Ein teil wo ihr wahrt, fahre ich persönlich oft ven ich in Croatien bin.
Beautiful!!
Mate sht his pants... relax... u are in the car with an F1 driver... sheesh
Dude by like….”I should have put grab handles on the passages side…”
1400 hp in sport mode isn't enough for you nico???
Amazingly, that is it
What a brilliant, brilliant video, Nico! Superb! 👏🏽👏🏽
Nico, what a blast ! Thank you for sharing and what a validation for Mate, an ex F1 champion loves his creation and bought one, great stuff and would be my choice of colours, given the funds to order one......can’t wait for the hybrid Bugatti......
Looks like bugatti has has very serious competition
aren’t there several cameras built into the car? why use gopros?  I would love to see footage from those cameras
What an incredible 2 part video! The discussion you had, mate’s face, the inside gossip on Bugatti! AMAZING
the rich can easily laught and steal money from the poor, even for watching videos etc. But our time is nothing worth, at least the rich get what they want.
4:00 can we get car wow to test it???
spettacolare Nico! Bravo!
Yaşıyorsun be şu hayatı Nico.
Nico, so happy for you! Your new car is awesome! I love it as well as the color! Looks fast sitting still!
Nico, did you wrap your entire car, inside and out in PPF?
Awesome!!!
How much is this car
I wanna see you go for a Nürburgring record with these thing
Bugatti Rimac will be insane… I can’t imagine the car they’ll create
Awesome choice, it Will look epic in Monaco 🇲🇨
Can't wait to see your AMG 1 in Red Nico 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
What you buy when Ferrari and Porsche won’t sell you a car! Adding HP is the least difficult thing in a hyper car. Being able to use that HP on a track is what matters. Rimac to my knowledge holds no records on any track.
Nicos fingers move so much when he accelerates, even though there’s no gears 😂
So much respect for what Mate has achieved and his way of running his own company. An extremely intelligent and forward thinking person.
The car is ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT 🤩🤩
Can’t wait to see Richard Hammond review it
First Nevera went to great hands, you are such a amazing person and you will be great ambasador of this car of which in Croatia we are very proud. Wish you a lot great kilometers with it
Great content Nico!
Looking awesome! 🔥
This drive feels like a free solo with Alex Honnold
I LOVE Mate's mindset ! the guy is one of most brilliant CEO in the automobile sector and he's still act and speak so humble !
I like the great progress in the insulation of the whole car, well done Mate and the team
What a monster of a car… Nico as usual showing his skills as always
Awesome awesome clip. The quality is very good in fact of high standard. Loved this upload. Thank you Nico!
at 00:53 Nico should've replied with another "What??" 🤣
Ha Ha So Funny......Ha! And Awesome.....Proper Weapon....!
Mate Rimac spent a lot of time making the car but the car needs to be more beautiful to be honest
Damn I wish Nico was still driving F1.. what a special human being
Not a fan of electric cars, but this one is totally amazing. N I love how Mate has pushed the needle forward
Two great guys living the dream whoooooshhhhhhhh 🏎
Your car is missing a V8 nico, otherwise nice car
Put wings on top and you can fly 🔥🔥 Electric monster ⚡️⚡️🌪
hope bugatti team wont be pissed of by mate revealing too much details of the next bugattirimac car.. car looks great,"black on black", just wish wheels were diferent style
Wow. Bravo Mate and Nico. Congrats on first Nevera.
Is it just me or is Nico way more likeable now that he is retired from F1?
why so many camera’s on the car, doesnt the car feature many onboard cameras for livestreams?
⚡MASTERPIECE OF AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY⚡
Wicked car, congrats!! The only bad thing is that I will never drive in one..
I have been following Rimac for so long. I am super impressed what they've achieved.
While climbing the hill Mate was feeling like he was in roller coaster not in Nevera. Nico really enjoyed the car it seems. And they blurred the speedo during Hill section 🤣 cheeky.
@ 4:05 matt Watson, hold my timing equipment.
9 seconds to 300.... He said that like "yeah... normal car things..." hahahaha :)
But did you let him know you became world champion in 2016 beating Hamilton in equal machinery?
I enjoyed watching all of everything got to do with the Rimac. it was a friendship made forever nice to see..
Maxed out performance
Nico! Why not a full Carbon car? It’s a super sexy one :)
The tech might be great but it ugly, looks like a Corvette!
Bog i Hrvati 🇭🇷🚘
Unbelievable coool!! such a  great  vibe in the car-conversation.. i m a fan of both characters indeed!  and the car  epic
Hilarious video with you scaring Mate. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
why are there so many , sooo many generic npc comments
Amazing 🤩
Amazing Nico. Un bien beau petit jouet!
Perfect car...❤
Cheers for the video guys 😎 👌
And the sound of the Nevera!  subtle but powerful
Fully electric...😂
I'm the only one here that would tell Nico: "FASTER ! FASTER !!!!" ??? 🤣🤣🤣
Best car YouTuber ever, thank you nico.
Ironically Nevera is Spanish slang for refrigerator.
Gotta tell us when you accelerate, can’t tell with these lame soundless electric cars
And just to know how difficult it is to start a business in Croatia and to succeed?! Struggle with bureaucracy, administration, workforce, high taxes, politics, high energy bills for companies and finally people who don't believe in you then they would only know the extent of Mate success. I'm from Croatia and I still can't believe that he managed all this here and didn't give up and leave, while they offered him a billion times better conditions in other countries where they would hardly have welcomed him. He stayed here and employed thousands of people, hundreds of top experts, he promotes the state, electric cars, and there is much more planned and many jobs and very good wages, which is lacking in Croatia. Well done Mate! Samo jako! 💪😀
Waiting eagerly for the next video with Nevara. I have fallen love with this baby.
Such a timeless design, it will be fresh for 20 years.
I think most of the people are waiting to see it at Ring doing 1-2 laps, maybe even 3 laps. Other than that, share your impressions. Thanks Nico
Monaco based YouTuber 👍👍👍
Estéticamente notable. Mecánicamente sobresaliente...supercoche!. Gran video, dos tipos brillantes...gracias!
Krvi ti issuove! 12:28
Monaco youtuber takes new car for a drive
Nico, welcome to Croatia 🇭🇷 Nice driving 👌💪🍻
I feel like Tesla took their roadster back to the drawing board because of this car 😂
the downside of selling million bucks hypercars. Every customer is overconfident and cocky. And most of them are not former F1 drivers
Is it just me or does it look like a Mclaren?
Monaco's based Youtuber
😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🚀
The drifting conversation at 6:13 .... I completely lost it laughing.  Nico and Mate are always so composed, but in that moment you could see Nico's personality and sense of humor come to the forefront.  As well as Mate's side eye at the speedo at 12:30.... Love it!!!!
Mr.Nachhaltigkeit   Dieses Automobil  Und die Welt retten mit einem Auto was kein Mensch braucht wie passt das zusammen
best video on the channel, just love seeing Nico bomb this thing up the hills
This is a Man who beat Mate Rimac in equal machinery.....
Mate's face😂
Ha ha! Mate, pa u rukama si vozača Formule 1, što se bojiš toliko?🤣🤣🤣
The design is timeless.. Looks good from all angles.. Nothing over the top.. All functional and at the same time can turn into a beast... But more than all this technology and beauty is the level head on this man and his attitude towards business and the people he works with
Everyone liking Mate, check the OMR Podcast with him and some guy from Porsche! Very interesting dude
Nico, such an inspiration you and Mate, what a life!
You drive effortlessly
Give Elon Mask or Jeff Bezos stock of  Rimac company and adios amor adios. So easy is it to destroy something like a cup of glass...
What if, Nico,s Dad joins him on a ride in this amazing car. 2 F1 Champions in a Rimac. Cruising in the mountains of Monaco and the City.
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 Awesome. He is one top, top man. More bosses need to take a leaf out of his book.
Homelander driving a hypercar
cool car
Love the way he thinks everyone should be equal and have shares in the company . Not like the other greedy Fat cats of this world. I wish him all the success.
Nico, show us more front looking camera view. We are hungry.
Not cool - when someone tells you "no", it means no, no matter what situation. And "when you are trying to get money off them"? Or "these guys don't feel sorry"? For 2 people so involved in the automotive industry very odd comments. Otherwise - amazing car.
Was für ein geiler Typ! Jaja, Nico du auch, aber ich meine Mate XD
Mate : Samir you’re breaking the car
Insane
I bet if Lewis Hamilton had the same car as 2016 f1 champion who beat Lewis Hamilton in the same machinery, Nico Rosenberg, would beat him in the same machinery.
Definitely too much of a car for Richard Hammond to drive 😂
Great job to our favorite Monaco based YouTuber!! Lol, kidding, well done Nico, great video!
He cant even drive  whit out protect
Cool video dude!! Just the guy’s chilling, talking about cars!!
Damn Nico, can’t wait for more content with the Rimac !
2 good guys out a drive, awesome 👍
THIS CAR IS A F****** MONSTER !  CONGRATS !
Outro song Plz?
So happy he got the first one
can i work for rimac? i have a technical degree in motor cars and sales man with electric cars.....so mate i would like to work with rimac.
If his figures are corr3ct the f1 car would beat it by half a second to 300.  Electric cars are monsters off the line but kind of fall on their faces on the top end.  The difficulty of making a reliable gearbox that can handle the torque is a significant barrier, two or three speed electric cars would be ridiculous
Nico is hilarious!!!
Dream car
I like Nico a lot and i like now this car also.Awesome .I want one greetings from Turkiye
Super Auto was Kostet das Ding habe ich irgendwie nicht gehört
There are no words in the dictionary that do justice to this piece of automotive genius!! And there’s more to come.. If I was a Ferrari, owner I would consider getting one of these instead!!
The car is just stunning. The engineering & looks are first class. And Mate comes across as such a humble & decent guy. Awesome video, enjoy your new car!
Congrats to your new HYPERCAR Nico...Grüße aus Zagreb 🇭🇷🇭🇷💯🤙🤙
The car must be so stable because Nico is so calm behind the wheel but when he was pushing the Ferrari F40, he was sh*tting his pants with his "driving like a brick" comment.
Im sure many ppl will crash this car,for sure...
very interesting car Nico, thanks for posting these informative videos on your channel.
The most lovely F1 driver ever
heard bad things about the rimac company and this car... wouldnt of bought this in a million years
Lovely color and awsome car 👌 👍
Nico you're AWESOME!
Elon will push for a 2001 HP car just to be on top 😂
Nico vielen Glück 🍀 mit deine neue Nevera..🇭🇷🍀🍀
Beautiful engineering, beautiful car,  beautiful people,  beautiful souls... 😊
you know its impressive when a person that drove a F1 car for a living thinks its impressive
These 2 guys are just so sympathic..  Mate's leadership style is great... keep it. Of course, the car is awesome, none of us can imagine the accelaration... send one to me... i pay back in 1500 years 😅
These guys dont feel sorry🤣🤣🤣
Great car !! Love the video, martin is super also 😀
1. Mate's calculating all his life choices leading up-to this moment 2. Rimac's management preparing a questionnaire for Mate tomorrow, even though it's a friday!  3. Zagreb Traffic Cops trying to get a screenshot of Nico's speed reading 4. Nico trashing AMG One and La Ferrari under 2 mins.
BRAVO Mate!👏👏👏👏
Pretty cool! That said next time I see this thing is best be in anger and get sideways or interest will be lost. All these claims and capabilities and I have never seen one getting a workout. Genuinely want to see it rip.
From the back reminds me of the BMW I8 , but good looking car 👍
Nico: “No, leave it in Track mode”! Got to love it…he’s like a boy on Christmas morning!👍
The aspark owl is supposed to be faster at 0-60 mph in 1,7 sec
So the Rimac put inside cameras to do not stick GoPro's on windscreen 🤔
Auto je strava, samo bi mu ja stavio concave ZP.06 stajale bi mu nešto al i ovo je 👌
Awesome car. The Tesla Plaid is about as fast and cost 20 times less.
Really sounds like they got NVH under control - in every other youtube video it sounded like there was a lego set loose in the car
Amazing video and car!
Very quick looks good  and is test vs model s plaid and lose plaid
Amazing Nico. And Rimac is amazing as well, something I can be proud of. 🇭🇷
Those rims are sick.. Great choice of spec!
Dreamy video, loved it. Escapism.
I love how you have fun keeping Mate on the edge of his seat! Awesome machine. Motoring taken to the next level. A car you order confidently without so much as a test drive (if only I could afford even a bolt on it). Thanks for sharing
Mate would have crapped himself but the g forces kept the poop in
The best possible color scheme for this car - amazing!
Congratulations on your new black beast I hope you enjoy it more and can't wait to see you drift it
How much will a new battery pack be in 13 years ?????
Is it as equal as the W7?
F1 does 0-200 km/h in 4 seconds. This car needs over 5 seconds.
Hey Nico, I'm so jealous :) Youtuber Bjorn Nyland does 1000km's challanges with various electric EV's. Best time is 9h.15m (Tesla Model 3 Perf. No Plaid tested yet). However, a lot of Autobahn km's and a former F1 driver, how fast can you go 1000km's (with charging times)? Would be awesome to watch. Rimac has provided you with a lot of cameras for sure. Another obvious thing is to drag race or track race with an F1 car :) Cheers mate
Zahl deine Steuern
great car , innovative , unique and well engineered.. Worth the pennies :D
The car is perfection at this moment, unbelivable power,traction, exterior and interior style is pure class and best thing is if you drive it in the speed limits you can get very long range so for a hypercar, its very practical.
It's a pity that you didn't drive to the race track on Grobnik So let's see how Nevera learns the fastest path
F1 champion couldn't keep his head straight? Well, that's all the evidence you'll ever need for acceleration of Nevera. Great job Mate
Somehow the video touched me emotionally, Nico Rosberg was and has always been an idol for me. I always hoped that one day he would be a Formula 1 world champion and the end of his career made me sad. I like the whole backstory with his father on Monaco.
Why even have such an purposeless car for road driving?
Very cool review and conversation between a real driver and a brilliant entrepreneur.  Thanks.
Really liked the casual conversations  u guys were having.... really insightfull....
Awesome to see the owner/founder of a marque have praise and passion for other manufacturers
Komisch keinen Motorsound beim Start Up zu hören, aber echt wildes Ding!
Can't wait for another video!
Congratz for the new car Nico and Matthew, bravo for your career it's really impressive!!
ist das Geschenk?
Congrats on the new car Nico! Its good to see hyper cars have a bright future even without the noice.
Almost the look Ford gave Shelby in the GT
"yea these guys don't feel sorry" That must be VW's CTO.
Looks good, we want next episode... 😉
Viđaj matana...
Is that Nico Rosberg driving his new Nevera? The 2016 world champion? Who beat Lewis Hamilton? In Equal machinery?
intro already had me laughing so hard
these bad "passengers" are mostly ppl that are good drivers themselves, because they obiviously know how thin the line between death and life is, when you push 2000hp to the limit...  if i was in the passenger seat of f1 driver however!?! boy i´d tell him to push as much and break as late as he can...!!! *taking notes  with all other ppl on this planet (especially when its my own car )... i will slap you if i´m in the passenger seat and you try to stunt :p  enjoy the car man... greetings from berlin...stay safe...  blessings
Mate seems like a genuine and humble person. More success to him and his team!
Until second Rimac Nevera deliver to customer every time you sit in car you will be fastest man on the planet and not a single car can beat you...and all that from country without car industry...👏👏👏
i saw that they blurred the speed 😂😂
Nico please take it to the track for a full performance test review!!!! No Mate holding you back!!
One of the best videos I have seen in a very long time, the way Nico and Mate interact with each other is amazing. They are both really interesting and super talented people, and the car is unbelievable as well, and if Mate continues like that he will be a future car manufacturing tycoon….
Thanks for the arrow in the preview, I would have never recognized the car otherwise
Absolutely ridiculous car. I just fall in love
Awesome video. I love watching Nico drive!
Mate is such a cool dude I wanna get a beer with him lol
What a good energy!
Nice interview and Mate is very humble and open person.
3:38 is he warming up the tires on the formation lap
Mate Rimac, what a fantastic guy,totally deserves the success he is having!
Really impressive,  and fantastic  looking as well.
What’s the screen in front blocked out for?
This guy is so scared
Amazing!!!!
🌪🌪🌪
Love the blur 😶‍🌫️
"out of common sense" wow. I thought I was alone thinking like this. Guess there still are some smart persons but nobody listens to them except we do all ourselves. Stupid world
Super cool rocket and color
Sick. Living the dream my friend.
First of all, the car is GORGEOUS! It's really beautiful to look at. Secondly, it's so planted on the road; you were working the steering as if it were a normal car. I remember when you took the Porsche 918 out on track, and you had to really work the wheel. OTOH, even on public roads, the Nevera was so solid, so composed, and so planted; it was easily doing what you wanted it to. Finally, it's awesome to see a great driver behind the wheel; it's great to see a car like this with a driver like you, someone who can really get a lot out of the car.
best intro to a video ive seen in a while.
yeah Im sure they changed it so the wing comes up at 80 and that he didn't actually do 140-150 😂
if someone who has started building cars because he likes speed is afraid of the speed of his own creation, you know that it is a really fast car.
Congratulations, good luck 🍻 Mate is genius 👏 👏👏
This is awesome ! Incredible how cars have evolved in the past 10 hears.  Mate, please take really good care of the design for the next Bugatti. The heart of the compagny is also in design and the Chiron was a masterpiece in this area.
I would love to ride with Nico in any vehicle! Still the coolest FI driver to me. Jenson Button seems like the most humble nice guy. Juan Manuel Fangio is the GOAT!
great job
6:33 hilarious 🤣
Nice choice on the rims Nico, the right wheels can take any vehicle to the next level......All black wheels are just boring..unless they're carbon fiber😎
What a stunning car. Congratulations
*Richard Hammond has left the chat*
Jeremy fragrance is into cars now 😛
niko ti si bog
Stunning car, it really is immaculate!
This car is INSANE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Take care of this fantastic car NIco!
Drive safe! I wouldn't even dare to touch a car with more than 300 HP
He reminds me of a Monaco based youtuber
insane! enjoy the car :)
Nico, really cool to see you not only drive your new Rimac Nevera, but also interview Mate and ask him the questions I was dying to know! Great video like always!
I'll be waiting for that video of you sliding around in it
Ciao Nico. Le elettriche sono il futuro e sono uno spasso da guidare, dalla mia modesta model3 non scenderei mai. Complimenti
Homelander has good taste in cars
do you people really follow these people who own a country and probably pay minimum wages to you when working you and your family to peaces?? these people make me sick, do you know the Billionairs In America The UK even Russia at the time, each country had enough money to save the world from being from starving to even homeless but they wont because they won't make enough to look good to them selves these p[people make me sick, FB Microsoft google etc etc etc don't really care........
You cant hate those boys, full of joy and happines! Future leaders!
The car is absolutely exquisite!
So Mate is the buyer of the green Valkyrie that was for sale at Tom Hartley Jnr. ??
babe wake up! the 2016 world champion who beat lewis Hamilton in equal machinery just got the first Rimac Nevera
Nice one! It is amazing what Rimac company achieved in this short time. I can see you being honestly happy with a car, performance and all details. Still I wanna ask you... Is there something you would like to change and company is looking forward to change it?
We dont see enough Rimac Nevera videos. Not happy about a hybrid Bugatti. Feels more like political economics pressure.
Cant believe this finally happened!!! Congrats!!! What a journey!
Very nice
not a give-away car? :D
_"and that was the last customer drive along Mate did"_ - Narrator (probably)🤣
Mate? That's a Hungarian name as far as I know.
Incredible car, huge congrats! Can we see a triple test with the Lotus Evija and Pininafarina Batista? Not sure anyone else could make it happen!
This is your channel nico, but the guy next to u, .....i bent for, europe's elon musk lol, really amazing car, driven by a pro..
Beautiful 👏👏👏👏
That moment when nico says, why not add more power on sport mode, mate - it has enough already 😅
Mate should make a software update so the car recognizes when he is the passenger seat and limits the power.
Thank you Nico what an amazing car
Every future Bugatti will not have a combustion Engine?? Did i hear that right?
Love it!
this was a very wholesome video, felt like 2 good friends catching up and discussing their future plans.
ugh i do feel sick when i hear these guys talking about the cars they have and have had previous, i cant help but be jealous but nico is such a nice human being you cant help but be happy for him even though he likely has not had a bad day in his life for the last 30 years.
This is how successful cool people live. Inspiring!
So why is the color of your AMG one a secret? Are you planning a reveal?
dont need to show your car we dgaf
Porsche recently set a new lap record at the Nürburgring.  Would be interesting to see if a Rimac can break a new record.
You see a big difference between Mate and all his customers :D .. Mate is basically an engineering nerd. His customers are pretty much machiavellian edgelords. ;))
Ah man banger video as always but I need to see this beast in drift mode 😩😩
Been driven by Nico as a chauffeur to the airport in an out-of-this-world supercar. Would not dare that even to dream of! Mate thank you.
Huiui! Bei Formel 1 Weltmeister Nico Rosberg wäre ich auch ein schlechter Beifahrer. :-*
Anyone else have a new dream car? Only car I want to see in person and ride in. Sorry Ferrari
why pick a volkswagen to film a 2000hp car :D
That car needs to be ripped around Silverstone what a machine
18:45 “All new Bugatti cars will be Hybrid”. That is significant news. Isn’t it?
This Guy is very SMART VERY VERY SMART, Listen to his response @20:29 he understands HIS THE COMPANY so if it doesn't work out then his not rich only when THE COMPANY works is when his going to be comfortable
Who? Lol
You could see by the look on Nico's face that he wanted to boot that car.
You should try this road with the Nevera: Named the “the best road in the world” by the Top Gear team in 2009, Transfagarasan has enjoyed a great popularity among the most beautiful roads in the world since. It is the second highest road in Romania and it is known for its spectacular landscapes.
6:18 ^^
@mate - great car, also u could not get any better guy to give it first. maybe niko should let some of his f1 friends try it for next. maybe Seb? he is mister green Nr1!
Amazing.!!!
Dude won life
So basically Mercedes is one of his worst choices and Ferrari are his best. 😂 Ironic but true.
Lewis could drive it better.
Thats ok Nico go for it, we also drift on Zapresic exit
Congrats Nico, such a special car 👌 Enjoy
Mate is a legend and so is Nico.
F1 car
Hard to believe its exactly 2000hp
F1 champion is impressed... Proud to be a Croatian... Anyway, anyhow, I'd like to be a... somehow be a Rimac part of the team.
Nico are you going to race your Rimac against a F1 var
I personally never believed that of Bugatti losing money with the veyron, made no sense to me, that’s a car that people would pay whatever the cost was, so if they sold then for $3.5M it’s the right price with the revenues included.
Don't love your spec, all black looks dull. Electric blue with caramel interior 👌
man i love the spec of your Nevera..looks so damn good in black
I wish he bought a real car.
Mate what a manager ! respect ! Congrats Nico on the nevera, great cool videos as usual ! I have been fan of Rimac since i knew about it 2 years ago from Welt documentaries !
Alternative title: 2016 Formula 1 Champion who beat Lewis Hamilton in the same machinery tortures a poor Rimac employee for 24 minutes and 46 seconds
Congrats for the car Nico  Enjoy cheers champion
Loved it, congrats and enjoy it as much as you can
7:45 "this guys don't feel sorry" I bet they didn't even pay for the car
Great car spec 👌and nice to see Croatia back on your videos ;)
Can’t wait to see what the future holds for Bugatti with this new management style from Rimac, I can foresee great this are coming for the HyperCar industry, even though it’s hard to imagine Bugatti without a W16, rear spoiler, normal doors and luxurious and comfy interior but also are very  exciting changes.
Excellent engineering, good investment Nico
Mate looks like he’s just discovered fire for the first time.
The design reminds me of current McLaren from the back and a bit Lotus-like at the front. It's not really to my taste, but it's definitely a beautiful car. The technology and the driving dynamics are definitely the most interesting thing about that car.
That story about the CTO crashing the car sounded expensive.
6:35 usrao se u gače😂😂
Still haven’t got the hang of driving then, still as bad as the days in F1. In Monaco could yet get a proper driver in it, I’m sure Jenson Button would help you out.
Mate: We put cameras in the car so that you don’t need GoPros. Nico: * Puts GoPros in the car to film *
Hey Nico can you to a fast lap in the Monaco F1 track with this new whip. ?
which color has your Bugatti?
9 sec to 300kmh....wtf lol
I think you need to take the car to the Ring before Monaco for a few laps
Even through the screen one can feel the adrenaline behind the wheel. Wow. What a monster Rimac has created even him was scared of it. 😆
is this jermy fragrance
Thanks for the arrow in the thumbnail, I was struggling to find the car... 😏
I am emotional as if Nico was complimenting my company and my car. Great job Mate! Great job!
Elon Musk could learn from this guy. Elon starts out so great, then whittled down to a meme.
When nico test a cars limit Mate was like: what I need to do in order to sell our car 🤣
Amazing car congrats!
This channel has finally started putting out the content I wished it would. Tremendous drive/interview.
Two Thumbs Up !!
beautiful car RIMAC is best ecar!
do a burnout
@nico rosberg Another quality vid Nico. Im so excited for this company. I think the world has a lot to learn from him Mate, thanks for sharing in! Well done on the purchase, I bet your stoked!
"these guys don't feel sorry"
This was one of the best introduction i have had to a car! Man what an inspirational video! What a journey this is gonna be for the car industry!
Grüß dich Nico, Pozdrav Mate, Es mach mich stolz zu sehen, wie du das beste Auto der Welt fährst. Ein Gewinn für beide Seiten. Vor einer Woche war ich selbst vor Ort und habe mir die Rimac Produktionsstätten in Zagreb (Sveta Nedelja) angeschaut. Danke Nico 🍀 Hvala Mate. 🍀
I have the carbon  plates 180 mm clutch from your father's Audi DTM car  , bought it for memorabilia :-)
25 mins of watching 2 people have a chat 👍🫤
👍
Nico i love ur content. So glad You Beat LH in a same car 😁🤩
I really like Mate's approach to management especially while integrating a legendary company like Bugatti into the fold. Much respect to Mate and his team!
Ajde jedan lagani video sa Grobnika. 👍👏
Wonderful!!!
Mabruk
Nico I really think this is by far the best car in the world in every aspect. This car will drive the competitors crazy because now they’ve realized that they’ve reached the limit on developing a petrol engine car that can outperform the Rimac !
A tesla plaid can do maybe 85-90% of what this car can do... True or False
Lol.. Easiest then beat Lewis. Quiter
17:38 Mate is being talked down to about liking the LaFerrari 😂  “No Mate! You’re car is way better”
Please give this Car to Tim Schrick for a proper ride on the Bilster Berg Track! 🥳
Such a bad buy... I got my BMW 318i '99 for 1000 euros. You could get around 2.500 cars like mine with that kind of money. Instead you only got one. And i don't see many like that on the streets and i've driven in a lot of countries. That tells a lot about it's reliability...
Broooo that car is amazing, i think is one of the best Hypercars ever made!!!
Great match! Nico definitely knows how to handle all this power and enjoys every second of it. Unfortunately most likely a lot of those will end up at some bored billionare's garage who has no intention of driving it properly. Huge success Rimac!
The car is drop dead gorgeous and yet so manly. Ted
I wonder which would be faster on a twisty mountain road, a rimac or a senna? Nevera will accelerate a lot faster but senna will be lighter and a lot more aero.
Wow amazing video, interview, car everything! Rimac guy is kinda funny, dude designs state of the art supercar but is scared to drive fast with one of the best drivers in tha world 🤭. But yeah he is obviously a genius, love the passion so inspiring.
Stunning Nico everything about that car screams extremely fast and gold class. I think Mate was thinking about getting Bugatti/Rimac into stage 2 and his story about taking out three poles in drift mode had him a bit terrified. I think you need to go to the Nurburgring and work on a 6.04 min lap.
21:24 - Mate: This is my first job **owns Bugatti and Rimac in his first job**
The man who beat the man who was on track to get a few in a row but was bested on track by the man in the same car.
Just 😆
Absolutely fabulous car and great insight...thanks.
NICO that was the best thing
12:38 you can smell the fear
What a great video and beautiful car!!
best youtuber rn hands down
Can we take a moment and appreciate the fact that Mate gave each of his employees their own share of the company? How about that for motivation? Will never see Jeff Bezos do that with Amazon...
Tooop car!!! Great drive Champ🤙🤙🤙
Nico, you are so cool. You wind up Mate so much. But we both know that race car drivers are the very worse passengers. So many people what to show us how good a driver they are. I’m always freaked out when the driver wants to show me how good a driver they are. Not Good. Again, your so cool  and a pleasure to watch. Ted
If you put Hamilton in the same machine, Nico will still beat him
12:00 Mate be like, when i'm in the car traction control is on cause car recognizes me
What an awesome car, nico is loving it and knows his stuff. God I miss him battling with Lewis in f1 and will be forever thankful of that final season he gave us. ✌️
I'm glad nico started this channel. Where else do you see this kind of content?
❤❤❤
0 km/h - 300 km/h in 9,8 Sekunden! Der pure Wahnsinn. 😎
Time for Carwow to make F1 vs Rimac
Better clean up the poo stains in that passenger seat.
Mate is the new Fabio Briatore: Jesus Christ !
Great great video man!! Enjoy the car, you deserved it!
That is an insane car! Congratulation Nico!I don't know Mate but he is so sympathetically! 👍
mate is class  when he is amaterialistic and successful, a trait of a true genius. he has my full respect and great production on this piece nico...background music is really nice as well especially with the drive around the mountains
how about rimac enters f1 :D
Mate  i'm just an f1 champion just stfu!!! :)
It amazes me that some people seem to have unlimited money while I cant even save one paycheck. There's such a massive difference in wealth to the point that I couldn't even afford the decal on this car vs you owning the entire car. Unreal existence.
proper curve-ball at 19:00.... Mate's been nervous throughout of Nico's pushing & prodding the car, & then he has to field an HR question! terrific stuff.
"you have to get used to the car"...hold my championship trophy!
There seems to be so many of these hypercars these days - when are the brilliant engineers going to produce a car that can be accessible to more people?
@1:25 anxiety-inducing
They’ve done a great job on the styling.  From the front, it’s significantly better proportioned than Gordon Murray’s T.50 and overall it’s prettier than the Lotus Evija.
Never seen someone who is so happy driving his newly 2million dollar car on the road.
Best first drive I've seen👍congrats Nico! what an awesome car😀
I would like to see the car to be in front of my house Nico, I thought It would be delivered today but you're using it in your Vlog.
Want to see nurburgring lap record in nevera
The way Mate talks about the structure of Rimac and how involved he wants each employee to feel, makes an American like me jealous. Quality of content keeps going up with this channel! Great job by you and the team with the last two videos!
Woow Nico i wish i saw you somwhere on the road 🥲😭 i literaly work 3min away.... Great car and great video! Proud to be a Croat!!
These guys don't feel sorry🙈
Honest talk, I think they forgot the cameras were on...
I think Rimac would be a good investment for the future. 😎 There will come a lot of interesting things from Mate.
To have the company owner of the fastest production car, take a ride with an F1 experienced driver that is pushing your car fairly hard on regular tarmac, would be an experience to remember. Both of them are lucky in this situation, as driver and passenger. What a dream to own a Rimac, let alone drive one... let alone drive one with the owner present.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 “ you have to get use to the car “
nice car
Usually people stop talking when they’re pushing the limits, Nico is clearly a world class professional because he talks calmly while learning and pushing a new car to its limits.
Nico...please let Richard Hammond drive it now.
The car is nice, the rims are too much bling bling.
This will be my go-to vid if I ever need instructions on downforce and its uses.
God, I would love to see Nico take this car on the track, a beast of a car getting pushed by a beast of a driver and vice versa
"You have to get used to the car" is just a more polite version of "SAMIR YOURE BREAKING THE CAR".
Congratulations Nico and Mate!
Wow this Nico guy is a good driver. Would be fun to see if he could beat a multiple F1 world champion in equal machinery!
Id love to have millions of £'s, lucky guy Nico, enjoy everyday of your life mate
Mr Rimac is a top guy
Just wooow 😅
Can I drive your car From ZG to Monaco?
he nearly shat himself😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Such a wealthy and smart dude and he uses apple junk, the worst, the greediest, the most overrated and the most backwarded company's devices.  I am both upset and disappointed.
Brutal car, love all the potential it bring.. Though i laughed so much at ~ 23.32 when at high way Nico say -"I still havn't reached 100%" and then they get passed by a car with the boot lid up...  Sure, it must been the film crews car but it's not apparent, hehe.  Thanks for the video Nico and Mate👍
lol you got him good
Rimac se usro kad ovaj po gasu hahahaha
Best car on the market.
Thank you for being the #1 customer and supporting Mate's efforts. He deserves his success, and you deserve the car :)
"these guy's don't feel sorry" real talk.
What a beating car.
15:50 Rosberg owes Mercedes nothing and is giving his honest unbiased diss.
Mate, ti si cudo. Mogu samo jos jednom po stoti put ponovit, kapa do poda 💪
Simply breathtaking, thank you Nico
"the traction is a disaster" reminds me of "it's a disaster" by Niki Lauda on Rush
No No No .... Brother I'll say less do this my man! Whatever gonna happen it's gonna be so ... intense 😜
This is fantastic Nico you're awesome.
This car suck and Mate Rimac suck, he get his money from dad trough politics
👍👍👍
Well an F1 car does a quarter mile uncorrected in around 8.5 at 176 mph. So nope, it is still faster than the Nevera.
Mate is the coolest nerd on earth😎💪🏼
The car is really amazing and it is people like Mate that hold the keys for the future of automobiles - looking forward to the what’s next -:)
Nico love love love this channel! Even though I, as many others watching will probably never be in a position to drive such an epic car, with these great videos we get to  experience the sheer joy through you! Cheers man!
Is it a hybrid?
“These guys don’t feel sorry” 😂😂
NIco, the RImac Nevera is amazing, congrats on getting One,. And the way you made Mate suffer was so funny.
Do you think it was “insane”? 😂
Poor Mate :(
Este es como un Corvette antes que lo tocará Ferrari y ahora lo toco Porsche y una posquita de cola de McLaren jajajjj pero viendo el tamaño y la trompa es un Maserati MC20
Marcus is shitting a brick lol
Mr. Rimac, thinks, Thank God I haven't eaten anything today. you can see very clearly that he gets sick easily and is afraid of dying....
4:28 look at his hands change the position. That's a professional driver.
9 sec from 0 to 300 ??? 😮😮😮 Really insane !!
oh I f*ckin loved matte's terrorized looks and reactions😂
BEST NICO VIDEO EVER!!!😃
Nico *selects drift mode* Mate *chuckles* "i'm in danger!"
Awsome!
7:46 - "these guys don't feel sorry" - he has a very good grasp on how people at that level operate ^^
Gotta be honest there’s very few ppl I’d feel safer in a car with than nico fookin rosberg
Čakej Triglav zavarovalnica lol??
thank you ..
Awesome content! Track day with the Rimac when???
Outro song; Soleil - Rise up Now
Jal 😁
Mate be thinking "please don't let him find the traction contr.....he's turned it off"
Saying the AMG One is "not special" is soooo disrespectful lol
In spanish we say BRUTAL!
I love these kind of electric cars. Sadly every consumer level electric car drives like sh*t. Someone please make a raw, sporty and affordable electric sports car!
Heißes Gefährt...ich wünsche dir viel Spaß... unglaublich!!
why does the passanger seat move arround so much
Black. What an exciting color…
I wanna see who dare you race against Nevera. Rimac RULES!!!
Great one Nico! Thanks for share:)
That black colour is just awesome on rimac nevera,👍😎
Nico live in Monaco? Taxes?
Loved the way Nico effortlessly hosts the video all the while driving a monster like a madman. Also, love Matte he sounds like an absolute car guy he seems to love all cars. the excitement he has talking about all those cars was really awesome to see. Me poor but if I had the money I would definitely trust that guy to build me a Hypercar.
Let Hammond take it for a spin.
22:22 Green and yellow amg one???
So Nico has gone for a red interior in the AMG One, bold choice
wow, they got rid of the stone chipping noise! totaly different experience for the viewer and iam sure for the driver aswell 👍
You need to get used to the car....trust me it's not a problem 🤣 F1 champ speaking
Keep the man alive, Nico!
Nico gotta go back start training his neck muscles 😂
Passenger side instrument cluster is censored but on 13:03 you can see the current speed on driver side cluster ;P
Nico should be the test driver for Mate. They should do Nevera - Rosberg edition with different traction control tuning ;)
Great words Rimac.
Why on Croatian plates? Not Monaco plate?
Poor guys shitting himself with a smile.
Are they driving in Croatia? That'd be insane. I was driving there and their asphalt soo slippery! Don't know why but I was sliding every corner. Kinda fun though :D
dunno what’s more annoying Nico’s voice, laugh or his personality. good thing he’s got such a punchable face
So quiet, yet with so much power. You can't even tell he's getting on it until you notice their cheeks are flapping back toward their ears, haha.
A Monaco-based youtuber drive for the first time his Rimac Nevera
Krasses Teil , Nico 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽
Well modern F1 cars accelerate from 0-200 kph in 4.2s in good conditions. Thats faster than the rimac. 0-300 kph they are about the same with around 9s. Although the aero drag of the f1 car slows it down quite heavily.
Hey it's the Monaco based youtuber again...
I like how the screen on passenger side was blurred while Nico was ripping it through the hills to hide the speed 🤣
Würde ich kaufen, wenn ich’s mir leisten könnte! Rimac beste! 🔥
Monster Car
Epic, on many levels.
The you tuber from Monaco
Homelander driving his Nevera!!
Holy cow, to have Nico in the driver seat of a car you designed and built would be a dream come true. I cant tell if Mate is freaking out or just enjoying the moment! Either way what an experience that must have been
you already know elon crashed this bih
AMAZING video!
How does this guy still make money ???
Que genios! Ambos, no conocia a Mate hasta ver tus videos, que pequeño me siento!
Zna netko gjde je tocno ta cesta??
That dynamic rear wing made me ink
Nico, we wanted you to tell us how it compares and feels to your championship winning mercedes f1 car
from 12:58 you can actually see Nico's left hand fingers as he is trying to "downshift", clicking movement, when decelerating, like he is in his F1  car :D  I assume its not easy to adapt to the fact that it doesnt have  a gearbox :D
I was certain he would say the last time he drove an F1 car was in 2016 in the year he beat the 7 times WDC Lewis Hamilton in equal machinery.
Less than 2 minutes and Nico drives with no hands! 🙂
Poor Mate definitely has some PTSD from driving with journalists and racer wannabee guys who crashed with him in the car....Be careful guys, Mate is a world treasure.
This is a great video! Very enjoyable. Nico you kept on smiling hahahaha
♥️
i don't get why she is so scared .. f1 pilots are one of the best drivers in the world .. woman :/
the car looks amazing, Mate is really nice to watch and take the damm thing to the track
At 6:11 Nicole smiles coz he realises Maté is not a good passenger... 6:16 and he's already winding him up 🤣 brilliant 👏
One of my favourite cars in the world
The car is perfect,great episode.
Amazing! What a car.
Gönn ich dir nicht, Rossberg
The famous Monaco based YouTuber.
Wow, listening to Matte is really something else. Great guy!
More and more impressed with Rimac. Impressive tech and impressive practically for a hypercar.  The black looks stunning. Need a video that just focuses on the exterior.
Awesome need to see it on the track, and 0 to 60 quarter mile etc!!
I have to say im not a huge fan of Nico Rosberg but I love Rimac, The guy behind it and the flair it portrays. Great Video, I might even become a fan of Nico!
Mate is the best 😂
Hi Nico! Sehr schönes Auto - sehr sympathisches "Interview" von Dir :-) Vielleicht sieht man sich ja bald in Monte Carlo 🙂
Great management lessons here :) common sense really good
So much respect for the humility and forward thinking of the CEO
Everything is beautiful, exept the plastic mirror and the camera is right on it. :D
6:14
Nine built in cameras and they needed two GoPros. Sigh
Ohhh ... such an amazing combination Nevera&Rosberg
Well at least when you hit a tree you won't notice ;-)
He kept having Richard Hammond flashbacks
Mate, you are my hero! Bravo!
Mate built the car and is still afraid of the power of the car 😄 When you fear your own creation. Funny 😛
I can’t believe the guy who beat Lewis Hamilton in the same machinery was able to drive this beast
It accelerate faster than f1 car.  F1 can do 0-300km/h in only 10.6 seconds, again, downforce comes into play as the more air a F1 car zips through, the faster they are able to go. So,yeah Nevera wins with only 9 seconds
Nico Bossberg
Wow Mate seems to be a good guy and looking after even his lowly paid employee, much respect to you Sir.
Congratulations To You & for Ceo of that impressive piece of Tech art ! I wish i can afford one and have the experience my self , and for me Your company will be Super winner ! Your humble and values makes me proud of hearing and make me want to invest on does shares to..... thanks for sharing the experience , Nico and Rimac Nevera genious , from Puerto Rico my Respects! Your truly Amazing !
the chillness when saying "this does 9 seconds to 300" got me
Nico ist complaining that there's only 1400hp available in sport mode lol
Has Lewis got one too so you're both driving around in equal machinery 😉
nico please have me passenger with you it would b a dream come true !!!!!!!!!!
🙏😭🤲
I would definitely listen to a podcast with Mate talking about anything except Rimac. Shame, Mate was about to go off about LaFerrari and Nico cut him off. I feel Mate is tired of talking about Rimac all the time and just wants to have a normal car guy conversation. So, if not you, Nico, have him for a podcast. I hope other podcaster has him, like Matt Farrah or some other car guy.
Such a dumb name for a car. Refrigerator? Really?
Niko: Why is sport mode only at 70% power?  Mate: Because, it is enough.
That car is beyond sick! Absolutely amazing
I'd really love a collab between you and matt from carwow... and maybe do a drag with a model s plaid
I still can't believe this car exist
So we need to reduce traveling and eat a less meat, is that what you suggest ? Great car by the way.
I'd love to see this against a Formula E car or F1 car. Would be interesting how well it could perform.
What is your time on the Nurburgring?
What a Beast ! Love it ! Nice Vid ! 😎
cant really be nervous with a f1 world champion im sure he can handle the car with ease
Your wife should do a reaction
it is scary when you know what can be done with this beast
the steering wheel looks like an murcielago stering wheel xd
I wonder when Rimac  stuff is going to end up in the XE trucks
He doesn’t want to pull a Paul walkers
Amazing 🤓❤️
Solid In car hangout between a titan of industry and a formula 1 world champ. Nico's passion for cars really shines..dont see much of that from F1 drivers.
Such a cool car, congratulations on getting one. Enjoy the car and please make more videos with Nevera. Greetings from Finland
This car is absolutely INSANE! Matte is nervous because he knows exactly how powerful it is. Nico, very good choice to choose this over other hypercars.
🤣haha Mate was pissing himself...amazing to see how involved they are with the process..you really buy something unique.
It's funny how the word Nevera means disbelief in Serbian. Seems fitting.
03:37 why is the Mate's seat moving so much? Never seen a seat move so wobbly
I could literally hear you two talking for hours. Nico ihr solltet zusammen einen Podcast aufnehmen. Ein follow-up zu euer Beyond Victory Episode!!
Such an amazing car
Nico and Mate you are f***** Legends 😁😁
Very Cool that a Monaco based youtuber was able to be the first to have this delivered! The same guy that in 2016 was able to beat 7 time world champion Lewis Hamilton in equal machinery.
Mate still looking over at nico’s speedometer when he has one right in front of him 🤣 Awsome car nico congratulations
LOL at Nico trolling Mate with the drifting. That was really funny. Love the car. What an amazing machine.
4:15 damn carwow famous
congratz to both
I feel like he had flashbacks to Richard Hammond and the Concept 1
I feel like he had flashbacks to Richard Hammond and the Concept 1
Mate got so nervous had to put the gloves on.
look at Nicos hands while he driving.. he always want to changes Gears :D He still a F1 Racer:D
3:22 wait track mode is the fullest or drift?
A million thumbs up from me.
Amazing car!You can’t go wrong with black and silver wheels,this combination looks good on anything…
Who’s a lucky boy ?? SENSATIONAL CAR ……. SPEECHLESS …..👍
such  a nice car i live near the factory
3:15 THAT'S THE COOLEST CAR COMPANY CEO I HAVE EVER SEEN LIKE THAT'S SO COOL TO BE JUST BE ABLE TO SEE IT AT 80KPH
Im pretty sure the evija is more powerful =p check your sources mate
Mate and Nico - the duo i didnˋt know i needed in my life lol just awesome
The editing is quite ridiculous.. we were supposed to see the street every now and them but we can only see their faces.. got to improve the quality!
Nico!👍👍👍
When will Bjørn Nyland do the 1000km challenge and banana box test? 🤪 gratuliere zum wahnsinnigen Fahrzeug 👌
That Rimac is absolutely gorgeous!! Probably the best looking electric car
It's electric, not interested. If it's so great enter it in the 24 hrs of Le Mans
He woke up clenching! Thou shall feel fear in the passenger seat of a world champion 😂😂😂😂😂
No Mi- Nico no!!!
i would like to see you drive some current f1 driver in your nevera in Monaco... there are, if i remember, max, lando, riciardo, lewis? in monaco... so yea that would be fun to see
Love this
get 2 of them more clicks.
Mate is the most incredibly impressive person... and he is still so young so its insane what he is still going to achieve... And he is exactly the same now as he was years ago... extremely likable, humble and still sees this as chapter one after the years... what a champion...
Man, years back Salomondrin drove Rimac with Mate and said that rimac is gonna be crazyyyy :)
junk
Amazing content champ ⚡️
23:38 swag
Mate's realisation that he made it...
It’s not faster than an f1 car but yeah close enough in a straight line
1:11 also The rear wing shape seems a bit changed to the pre production model
@4:40 accelerated so hard, it almost removed nico's english language
Those are so lame
You should have purchased the pininfarina instead
12:32 You know you're having fun when the speedo gets blurred out
1:09 wait does rimac offer those wheels?!
Nico sounded offended that Sport Mode "only" had 70% power 😂
Did your car get a power boost to be 2000hp?  I thought the Nevera was 1914hp?
Fantastic car. 😍😘
Amazing Car Nico !!! Congratulations Rimac
Hallo Nico, Gratulation zum Super Car. 👍🏻 Ein sehr cooles Video. Danke das wir Teil haben dürfen. 😊 Ich muss sagen, ein sehr schönen Konfiguration. Ich wünsche dir viele, aufregende, sichere Km. Gruß Jan.
All black nevera😎 that's clean👍🏻
07:45 this guys dont feel sorry... but they still far behind you Mate!
I think Mate liked the mountain drive and also dont think he'll be going on drives with other customers. 😅
If somebody didn't know who Mate was, after seeing how scared he was of pushing cars to their limits, would never believe he owned rimac and bugatti
Y u need 2k hp?? U can't even go above 70mph on the highway.... or 40mph on city....
Wow wow what a car
i can hear matt heart beat when nico drive at the hill
Omg, is a guy that beat a 7 time world champion in equal machinery driving the fastest production car in the world?
Awesome car ! Congrats to the whole Rimac Team 🫶🏼
Nico, I can only imagine how good friend can U be with such power and  cheerful lifestyle. When I visit Monaco, I’ll buy U a beer. Cheers! Life enthusiast from Poland
Bet you can defeat lewis with this same machinery like how you beat the 7 time WDC Sir Lewis Hamilton in the FIA Formula 1 2016 season in the same machinery?
What a car! What a CEO and what a company. Congratulations Nico
Even though Nico is an amazing driver. Driving like this on public roads with a car you have just taken delivery of is proper stupid.
This is Nico Rosberg. He beat Lewis Hamilton  in the same car. What a champ 😁
Wow... need to make them 50k 🤣
just one word.... INSANE
The Penninferena Battista looks way cooler than Nevera...
Nico you are the man! I miss seeing you race. So happy you are doing well after your career, congrats on the new car :)
THIS IS AMAIZING. RIMAC IS THE VERY BEST FUTURE OF CARS .. LOVE TO BE PART OF THIS  UNIQUE TIME
Did Mate not put "oh sh*t" handles for the passenger? Because he definitely needs to hold onto them when Nico is driving! 😂😂 He looks proper nervous when Nico is attacking the twisties!
Fantastic ....and just pronunciation is with C not K
You both are so inspiring story for all the young people who want to dream. I admire on your passion about cars. Great guys, keep it MEGA! 👍👍👍
Watching him and christian von Koenigsegg you can see how passionate they are about their epic machines 🤘
The road noise 👎
Nico is nothing if not in F1
Monaco based youtuber
Looks like a bootleg McLaren with a Corvette ass to be honest
23:28  Mh guy just slipping past him with an open boot 😂😂
Didn’t expect there to be so much wind noise, as there seems to be 🧐
Still prefer the koenigzegg...sorry.
Nico should've pulled a Kimi and said "Leave me alone, I know what I'm doing." 😅
See, being a YouTuber is all you need to be in life
Awesome video nico, great addition to your collection!! Also how much better is the rimac than the amg one???
I want see this car battle with Tesla roadster
What a piece of kit!  So proud to have a genious like Mate on european soil.
Wow!
Really want concept one in production 😁
Hello Nico, Please do a 0-100, top speed and range test of the rimac nevera. I am really looking forward to it..
i literally thought i was seeing two friends talk...it doesnt look like he is trying to convince you even more if this is the best car...if there is a thing he doesnt like he is just saying it by himself
Don't think Hamilton could do this in equal machinery, could he?
6:45
7:45 "These guys don't feel sorry..." ... sad and true  Edit: Poor Mate, he looked a bit stressed  24:20 Absolutely amazing!
Who’s the bearded guy ??
What a awesome content. I just wish I could see more footage of its visual, what a beautiful beast this Rimac Nivera is
After Watching the Video, I really think Nico misses the paddle shifters behind the steering wheel.
Amazing! You could have made the most epic roadtrip to Monaco in the Nevera btw...
Kad je Nico toliko uzbuđen, dok vozi, a čovjek je naviko na ogromone G sile... ne mogu ni zamisliti, kolika je to sila od avta.
I could listen to you all day
Two legends 😊
If he beats Musk in Full/Autonomic self driving, and that's going to be hard and his best achievement by far because whatever sensors you use it can only be done by trained AI and Tesla is lightyears ahead, but if he does he can buy every Koenigsegg and AM Valk ever made easily. Would have liked if asked some questions about how he sees it and his idea, it mega interesting, it will change the world
You are incredible men 👍
Miss you on track Nico
12:55 u can see how nervous the rimac ceo is 😂
Proper Unbelievable
Mate is like - Why I have to do this just go slowly   And Mercedes one Vs Aston Martin Valkyrie is bit of rivalry between Mercedes AMG F1 Vs Redbull F1 isnt it   Looking for some interesting records
You know it’s real when the wing comes up 😂
It looks almost serpentine from the front - beautiful!
i'll choose same material as Mate-Visible carbon n brushed aluminium(i love those 2)
Safe kilometers! I want to see Keke driving it and his reaction 😄
Mate -- what a beautiful man, his values and truth about life and people.  Thanks Nico for your questions.
"you gotta get used to the car!" 🤣🤣
The Monaco based you tuber !!
Awesome car, Nico… can’t wait to see more videos of this, especially on the track!
Schöne Spazierfahrt :-)
Hey Nico make exhaust note video of this car  lovely video bruv
17:38 niki rosberg??? It's a  ferrari :))))
Should’ve drifted it just for her…I mean, for his reaction.
When you freak out a guy in a car that he built.
Congratulation for Rimac for great car!
as we know, supercars of today have their power and tech flow down a decade or two later. by the time i'm 40, we should be seeing sedans with 1200+ electric ponies!
I am super glad for a guy like nico to get his hands on one of these exclusive hypercars, gives us a chance to see them in videos.  Project 1 merc and valkyrie, never see any content with cars.
When will we see your amg one
NICO I NEED UR HELP!!!!!!!!!!!
Nico being a typical F1 driver, they just LOVE to wind passengers up and scare them by driving like nutters, yet they are in full control of the car, usually.
I hope that I can own one in the future as well.
Anything u do with that car would be awesome
I see the videos from driving fast in the hill's and my neck starts to hurt 😀
For me, this was less about the amazing car but more about the (pseudo) interview about the future of Rimac! Amazing philosophy and dedication!   On the other hand, Nico has shown the world how to reinvent oneself! Amazing use of his knowledge and never afraid to ask the most obvious questions... Enjoyed this to the max! Drive Safely Nico!
Journey from a factory in Croatia to Monaco!!!
I wounder when authorities will limit the max power an electric roadlegal car is allowed to have?!?
Great interview! High respect.
The car is pure class, this channel is pure class as is Mate, what an inspiring fella he is.  Nico you are way too cool, especially when behind the steering wheel it's as if you connect with the car completely. Thank you for sharing this special day with us!
beautiful nico.
A owner shook of their own car, priceless. I've ways said if I could own one I would buy
Would love to see a conversation between Mate and Christian von Koenigsegg. Absolute next level brains!
13:37 Midst mild panic he still made an involuntary “woo” despite his obvious passenger terror … the moment struck him. What a career milestone, first drive, first car with Nico. That smile!!
this duo is awesome
thank for the video i wish i can see more of this car
First Rimac Nevera drive from monaco based YouTuber
Sheesh what fun your gonna have in that car it`s stupendous.
There are no words.
Really excited for the future of Bugatti Rimac! Mate is a gem of a CEO ❤️
I know Nico is a super star f1 driver but it amazes me how nonchalantly he's driving these hardcore cars as if he's in his living room.
unreal looking car....great owner attitude about how hes running his company seems like a super cool guy Thx for share
23:35 that VW in back is on another level
Nico, I want to see Keke's reaction to the car. I usually hate the "reaction video's" but this time I would make an expection. Kippis!
Monaco based youtuber
Never seen anyone so happy in their new car, Nico you are one lucky dude to be able to afford such a wonderful vehicle. And the insurance even for you must be horrendous. Great car, great video. Let us see you take it on the Nurburgring and drift it, but carefully 😁.
2 great men 👏  enjoy Nico 👍
Amazing Nico ! Love you. No homo tho
Nico, a video for the archives, absolutely legendary, great real life and personal honest live "podcast moment""
Nico I love that rear wing!U used to speed ,but I'm sure it'll b  frighteningly quick!Just as well u know how to handle a beast like this!💪👍🙏👌💪💪🔥👍
That front end with those wheels is absolutely gorgeous!
That's Nico F'n Rosberg. Who else do you have in the drivers seat?
Mate: you can go back to sport mode Nico : I quite like track mode *turns track mode back on Mate stares outside regretting getting in the car.  Edit: Timestamp 5:31
Mate is such a humble guy for someone that talented, that's amazing to see !
Quick glance looks like a C8 from front lol
"Monaco based YouTuber tries his new hypercar"
This is an awesome car
As a poverty stricken You Tuber buying 80s and 90s BMW's and who hates modern technology I'm hating you right now for making me want one of these SOOOOOO bad haha. Thanks Nico lol
Lonely he’s so lonely all on his own he’s so lonely he’s has nobody except for that carrrr
Whats the outro song?
Why did he have gloves on in first place ?
These guys dont feel sorry 😎
It was really fun....that Mate reaction....hi hi hi....
*Prominent Monaco resident 😂
The most amazing this about this car is that I reached the end of the video without hating the sound of it and that's never happened before with an electric car.
What is the fuel consumption ?
Jajajajajajajajaja
EPIC, Epic guys, so down to earth. The car looks Epic, love the colour combo. No comparison to my silver Astra though 😆
The more I watch this video, the more I like you both!
rimac c2 changes as... rimac nenera? nice
9s bis 300 km/h Whaaaaaat Ich musste erstmal das Video anhalten,  um das zu verdauen...
Nico's muscle memory shifting those none existed gears
Come on is a F1 driver 🤣🤣🤣🙏🏻
The shareholders in rimac is amazing. He got it from the old communism factory shareholder model in yugoslavia
ONLY EV with a SOUL. Also anyone else notice Nico’s fingers moving when his brain tells him shift? While he accelerates and brakes his fingers twitch as if they are trying to hit the floppy paddles that don’t exist.
Amazing, beautiful,  sensational.
Mate’s face when Nico effortlessly rips his car around talking to him. Hearing an F1 champions feedback in the passenger of your own supercar must be such a special feeling, no wonder he had no words he will never forget that ride Nico.
Thats the right car for you
Many congratulations Nico! The car looks wonderful.  A suggestion about this review was that it has too many shots from inside the car and very limited on how the spoiler works under the different settings.  My question to you would be - what do you feel about the automatic selection of the car for the heat management from the brakes to the battery. Does it impact battery performance in the long term?
The looks alone are insane, and then hé talks about all the tech, wow this guy is a genius.
Great video Nico, love the concept. Keep up.
Kakav je ovaj Mate gospodin i koliko se vidi da ne radi auto kako bi se obogatio nego da ispuni dječački san… Svaka čast majstore, nadamo se projektima nekim koji su i za “naš džep”
Mate calls it common sense but really he's a real time action hero SAGE. Look at how he speaks and works. He's a sage even if he doesn't know it.
Why in the world almost nobody even knows this awesome guy and praise someone like Elon Musk who's just full of himself like a god is beyond me.
Absolutely stunning looking car!  Thankyou for sharing the first drive with us.
I might be wrong, but Rimac is the first full EV that focuses on the overall driving dynamics instead of just 0-100 straight line acceleration.  Sure, Porsche has the first production performance EV car, but Rimac started the first prototype in 2011.  Good job Rimac.
love the car
Just a little bit jealous  😉
Love this
Go on the nordschleife and try to beat the production car record.
This is great news for Rimac i wish them best luck to become one of the most important automobile companies. We need this level of innovative competence here in Europe.
If I had the money! Immediately! What a car and what a great person Mate is ! Thanks Nico !
I think Mate need new underpants 😂
Can't wait to see this on a racetrack or autobahn.
That “cold open” was so hilarious! 😂
Mannn he was so nervous
I bet the steering wheel costs more than the entire car of mine!
You guys should do Rimac VS F1 car!
Is just a car....you get bored after 3 days driving it...ahahahaha! Congrats Nico! Nice one!
Damn... My dream is to work in RIMAC. You can easily feel that passion and pushing to development like in formula student teams <3
i want to love it but i'll take the slow LFA/CGT or anything with a screaming engine any day
Was waiting for this
it does hit 0-300 in  about the same time as 2016 mercedes f1 car
WARNING!!!! There are a lot of SCAM comments under this video!! If you see some account that says to text to some number DON'T do it and report them!!!
It's brilliant!
Dude is scared with nico rosberg the formula one 2016 race car driver who won the formula one world champion beating lewis Hamilton in the same machinery driving it lol he wont let customers even look at the car
The AMG One is a massive PR fail
You want to go back to sport mode? No no I quite like track mode. 😂
What did you pay for it?
Congratulation, what an amazing car!!!
Is this car self charging through the brakes or do you have to plug it in and charge because that’s the bit that ruins electric cars
Go to Nurburgring, set a lap time :)
Nikola Tesla would be proud of his countryman
Who do Rimac make batteries for nowadays? Taycan/E-tron GT?
Whenever I go for a drive in my car now, it's going to be "meep x AMG", rather than "meep drives their AMG" 🙄
Nico Rosberg + a 1900 HP car = The greatest madness I have been waiting for last few years.
Mate is probably thinking of doing slower cars from now on.
What's up "YouTuber who got the first electric hypercar" lol cheers!
Keke the kind of guy to go for the lap record on a demo run in town.
If Mate is this nervous with Nico driving his car, I can only imagine how he'll feel when other customers drive it for the first time
Now I'm curious who wrecked that Rimac...
Even if it doesn't reach 300 kph quicker than an F1 car, it's likely still well ahead on the road when either hits it. For sure Nevera hits 350 kph quicker, if modern F1 cars can even reach that under normal circumstances.
Cool!!
O yeah baby😍
Hello from Greece 🇬🇷 💙
This car is really a beauty and a tech dream. Kudos to you for the wise choise!!
3:39 warming up tyres 🤣
Boring electric!!
Eres un grande Nico bendiciones hoy mañana y siempre
Soooooo awesome
Stunning car it really is ! Congrats!
6.15 .. when the company owner doesn't trust a world champion 😅
Nico, congratulations on your new Hypercar😎👍🏻 Best wishes and enjoy it!  Regards from Croatia 🇭🇷✌🏻
I definitely rate this Rimac a 10/10 😃👍. I can't wait to see what you think about it in this video Nico :)
Navigation System is all over the Place 😅
this car is absurd, and companies are just getting started with insane hybrid and electric torque and power, great video!
The perfect car for a formula 1 world champion. Awesome choice. Nico .
Mate na aparatima tijekom drifta! 🤣
Nico der Deutsche F1 Legend.
love the intro !
I'd let you take me full throttle what the heck lemme hop in real quick 😭
I really love Nico's content on yt i subscribed today and was on streak of binge watch!
Here for the worst (scared) passenger in the world: Mate Rimac
You and Mate are such inspiring and nice persons! Can’t wait to see the Video 🙌
I enjoy your content. ❤️
Sensational drive and vehicle
SHEEEEESH what a fine car you have there
Awesome Nico!

POLE

Electrifying?
Finally :D
6:15 2,000HP + Drift Mode...it seems someone got nervous?! 😂 Who'd be up for this experience?
What would you like to see when the car comes down to Monaco? Share your ideas below!
