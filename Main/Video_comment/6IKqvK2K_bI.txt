Since this went live on a Friday, I will not plug the stream.    I lied. Twitch.tv/sallyisadog
Anyone remember the sally pistols
How far Sally has grown is crazy. Makes me really think about how she’s getting to be an old girl. Which has me thinking about my old girl. Now I’m sad but thankful for all the years I got with my doggo.
Pretty cool 😎
I hate this but I like you. I’m conflicted
Out of the streamers and plays ive watched, SALLY YOU DESERVE IT!!
Attempt two at getting sally to help me destroy all the kids who should go back to fortnite and to win a match of warzone
i have a cod poster in my room and it says “sally” on it BRO
Nah it's your dog
God loves y’all so much sent Jesus his one and only begotten son to die on the cross for us and for our sin so pls just him his time of day
Warzone a game full of cheaters... What a waste of time.
I think Steve should get payed
Hey Sally they put your name in bo1 when you load in the game on the pistol the guy is holding
How about your channel name goes from "Sally Is A Dog" to "Sally Is Dogwater"?
Bro that's from black ops one smart one.  The pack a punched m1911 is called the mustang and Sally.  Your a genius
Trash game
Lollll
Wow big respect and fu**en cool
It is not you it is reafering to masons guns
Sally was on a gun in BO3 too… it’s not because of you. It’s the campaign
Big head
your name, or your dogo’s name?
Kk idc
It's... It's literally a reference to the cover art of Black Ops. Do people not remember good games?
Bruh this is why I hate tiktokers you don’t know what’s real or not, obviously this isn’t real because the “sally” has been on guns since bo1
Sally might acctualy be an old Easter egg from BO1 Zombies, packapunch 2 M1911's and they get the names "Mustang" and "Sally" 🤔
I have a REALY big feeling that ITS A REFERENCE YO THE MUSTANG AND    SALLY FROM THE BO1 OPENING PAGE.
I love how your name is Sally is a dog then after I finished watching this short I went to the next and it was a dog scratching in a toilet.
The truth is , Sally is a reference to the original black ops game that released in 2010..
Is that Google pixel 6
When you have a 2 Google Pixels
I love Steve he looked so happy
Idk if this is a joke or not but Sally is from Mustang and Sally
Don't use God's name in vain
Who liked this and why?
Can Steve  a little respect plz😭😖🙏
Thats from bo1
I’m so tired of seeing your shit bro you’re like 50 get off yt
Warden 2.0
This is so cute they love u
"Doghouse" you mean he didn't maintain his masculine frame and thus was controlled by a women?
Steve works so hard 😮‍💨 but no one appreciates him 😔
Might be a reference to mustang and sally too but if nit then good gon
You look like iron Man
I watch you
And whist I watch this I'm making caramel, in the microwave, home alone, scared for my life because like- it's hot caramel that can burn me..
Bro we might have the same phone
Sally has been a name in the game since blacks ops 1 smh you flatter yourself
That blue print is for Mustang and sally in bo1
Ur also in this seasons loading screen in Cold War look on the gun
Gj
He made 223k dollars cuz it has 223k likes
You are in black  ops
I wonder how Sally (the dog) feels like after finding out his owner and Sally's name is in the game...
Sally has been a thing on guns since the bo1 days
I need to get paid
I think that's a reference to masens gf/wife (don't remember)
Isn’t that a mustang and sally reference
Its because of the bo1 front cover with mustang and sally
i thought the blueprint was a reference to bo1
Who dafuq are you tho?
What I'd they mean Sally from the mustang and Sally
You know it’s pretty funny how you’re pretty much getting people to follow you to get your own money cause twitch I think actually pays you for every four followers
Is.... Is that a pixel 6..?
Sally isnt even a reference to u like there havibg it therefor mustand amd Sally like from bo2 and bo1
Pog?
This is definitely an Ode to “Mustang and Sally” Jack Dempsey’s secondary;  The M1911 Colt .45
You owe Steve 359K
Steve is in his Basement
Wait did they do the same on cod 1 with the guy in the loading screen had a pistol with Sally on it. Is he the origins behind it?
I have a Google pixel 2xl to
Is Steve you or someone else that looks like done a cool to you I just want to know
I'm the 669th comment
Bless the guy who made the comments 666 to 667
I’m pretty sure that is a reference to the first black ops cover…
I like Steven he's a cool dude
Does he actually have his own skin
The Sally is an Easter egg for the mustang and sally I think
Ur phone is pixel 6
Who's gonna tell him
No that blue print is actually for sally and mustang from old cod zombies
I think its a black ops reference, you know, mason's gun
In cold war 💀
BO1 reference go maybe?
This not u that’s a reference for mustang and sally
Dude that’s not YOUR name it’s a throwback to mustang and sally and it even has the tally marks as the same gun that the BO1 dude is holding REPEAT it’s NOT your gun it’s a throwback
Just because it has your name doesn’t mean it’s your check bo1 front page starter screen
Me knowing it’s from black ops 1
Its a reference from the bo2 zombies pack a punched 1911 "mustang and sally" but ok.
Is that really a skin of him?
Its actually a reference to masons pistols mustang and sally
sally should i sub with prime? 🤔
موسيقى واثم وكذا يعني...
Lifehack for no followers
Omg so a follow generated profit must be like $.10 huh?
Not ur name that was on the. Pistol in bo1 did not get me
Poor guy he did everything to make u happy but he's dying inside xD
Its on call of duty black ops main sceen
There’s lines so it’s for the mustang and sally
Pay Steve
The Sally is a reference to mustang and Sally from bo1
When you havent heard of mustang and sallys
No
Sally was a 1911 pistol in the original black ops, you can't get it in-game, but you can see it on the cover image, sorry bro
Yeah go play Black ops 1 I'm sure you'll find it
Here's a dollar Steve. 🤘😁
Ayyyyye #teampixel 🥂
These are fake they are the same people (I think)
Does he not realize that the gun has sally it as a refference to the bo1 cover with the 1911 that has SALLY engraved on it💀🤣
It’s a reference to bo1 I think🤦
They didnt lit u in the game go on bo1 a d look at the pistols the guy is holding
SALLY is a reference to mason
Steve will get paid
Hes in two games, Black Ops (the thumbnail) and Warzone or Cold War.
Why can’t I find your character?
Actualy the blueprint name is on masons gun in the blackops 1 loading screen
Lol hives them money for useless shit how do we even know he's the one with the clips ?
WOW WE NEED TO GET STEVE PAID..
Bruh its an reference to Sally and mustang from bo1
The name Sally on the blueprint is a black ops reference. It refers to the pack-a-punch version of the starting pistol which is called mustang and Sally. Not reference to you. Sorry bud.
Looks more like a mustang and Sally reference.
I think its a reference to mustang and Sally?
sally lots of love man
If you truly believe that Jesus is God, that Jesus died on the cross for all our sins and rose from the dead three days later, acknowledge and repent of all your sins to God (but don’t just say I wanna change my sinful ways and then do nothing about it, that’s called playing the hypocrite), and trust and love God with everything you got, as your number One! Then God will save you from hell and give you the gift of eternal life with Him! And make sure to continuously live for and love God for your entire life! God DOES NOT hate you,GOD LOVES YOU and wants to SAVE YOU!!!!!
steve felt bad and then made the whole problem more harder as f9ck
OG’s know that’s not his name. That’s mustangs sister
Bruh, give him 10 dollars
Bro what did i do to you?
Reee where do I find you in the operator pack.
You did not you lies
Fun fact: Sally has a MI11 ULTRA.
I love you but dude you can’t claim this it’s from bo1 cover masons holding sally and mustang pistol
I just looked at your Google pixel 3a for all the video lol and also your 4a
Exodus Chapter 20 Verse 7 Don’t use the Lords name in vain
I have that phone case
Is it just me or does Steve look just like this Sally guy ?
If you think these are real then you are dumb af lmao He never got his own skin or blueprint.
Has no one in Sally’s comments ever played black ops 2, I know this is a joke but y’all need to start to playing more cod games. The the blueprint referred to a character who goes by the name sally (coincidence) in mob of the dead which is a zombies map in bo2, the map follows a storyline in which 4 random people went to Alcatraz prison: Sally, Bill, Weasel, and Fin. They’re trying to escape the prison because everyone turned into zombies. So that’s why in the blueprint there is 5 lines because in the game sally had written lines in his cell like to count how many days he’s been there. You’re welcome
That's not you it's a black ops reference. Mustang and sally
Thats not your name that's a reference from call of duty black ops 1
😐cool
I love how this game has taken a turn for the worst.
It says no comments yet
Not being a Hater but Sally is From The First Black Ops on the Cover, the twin 1911's it's just inconvenient that you're name is also the same.
Umm yeah he got 20k followers
Idk the skin u say is ur skin kinda looks like stod a bit more.
Free him please
Steven or Steve is you because u look just like him same beard same mustache
Bruh it's a joke
Cringe
Google pixel gang wya 😈😈😈🥱🥱🥱
Tell me you never play the OG Call of Duty without telling me you never played or call of duty
Well i think that it is a reference to the Black Ops 1 main menu which has a set of 1911s with those tally marks and Sally on them
Hi sally
Check the starting screen of black ops one and look at the pistol on the left
Its almost like everyone forgot about modern  warfare 2019, Its all just warzone now
That's littlerally the Sally from mustang and sally.... but yeah that's for you name.... that exact image is on the 1911 in bo1 and bo2
Me not on tiktok but YouTube shorts: "Steve lived a wealthy life with only 2 million dollars." Sally ruined his life by not saying subscribe.
Thats a bo1 refference, not your name
Tbh that sally skin has nothing to do with you, it’s based of the old bo1 pistols mustang and sally it’s pretty much the same pack a punch skin for the sally in bo1, you not special your names just sally 😂😂😂
Pay him 10 cents per 100 follows
is that a paper phone? look how than it's
I feel like they are trying to keep fans of the older games happy and fans of the streaming community happy at the same time
Future sally: "here's a story on how cod made me the owner of the game"
Has everyone forgotten about mustang and Sally the two m1911s?
This is not you in the game I'm pretty sure this is a reference to Mason's pistols
A skin is better than a fucking blueprint like tf?
Its a reference to bo1
It was based off of call of duty 1 the  pistol it sally
Bro Ik you already have a vid about this but this is cap not trying to hate but in the first black ops it says sally 3 and idk if you played back then but that’s the gun skin from back then
cringe
Woah I've never seen Sally with scratch marks on  a gun before
Same with jack on new battlefield 😂
It's a reference to the Mustang and Sally pistols Mason wields in Bo1
Can I be in a game
But little did he know this was the worst decision he has ever made
Thank u so much cause i have it and love the skin
Yo why you camping
Does anyone see that hes whereing a ninja huddy
Bro as much as that would be cool in pretty sure it goes back to black ops 1 where it had a pistol called Sally also it's in the zombies series i believe
my name is too in the game on the m16 (Sasha)
Neighbor stopped kidnapping kids and decided to start a new life
Pay sally
Ummmmmmm Mustang n Sally fron BO1 was the first thing that same to my head when I say the name, font and even round counter from zombies
He was in the dog house!
He thought we wouldn’t know it was him!?! He didn’t even disguise himself 😂😂
I have the pistol
Fun fact: it is actually named after Sally ravige
Bruh nobody finds warzone funny. Its a bad game at this point
Yeah im pretty sure thats refering to mustang and sally from zombies as there is a tally just like in zombies
AYY A I DID A THING CAMEO
Or…Sally’s been a common name for guns in COD…Mustang and sally ring a bell??
Black ops one players:😐😐😐
🤧🤧😪😪😪😪
I want my own skin
Wasn’t there a sally carved in to the pistol in the loading screen in bo1
The sad thing is that not your name it referencing. Mustang and sally from bo2
Or Mustang&Sally
Sally is what they put on the pistols in cod black ops 1 it’s not a reference to you. Sorry to say I don’t mean to be rude about it I was just explaining it
Uhhh so we gonna forget Sally and Mustang okay
That's not for you that's a og thing from cod zombies
Sally from BO 1. Simmer down.
I know if you know this but Sally is a known name in the bo1 community it's pretty much based off the Mustang and Sally but whatever
Thats sick
Ok idagf about the video because I see a Giant and I mean a GIANT DUCK in the back of this guys room
Dude I want my own blueprint how much does it cost to get. This Activision could make some serious money letting us create a avatar in cod someday not just guns.
Mustang and sally
You do know that on the side of masons gun it said sally so it could be a throwback to that just because your a popular streamer doesn’t mean everything is for you lol
You can tell warzone is Sally's first cod
Plot twist they only did it to make 20 bucks off you
Lol I played a match with Sally. Didn't know who he was at the time.
Bro that’s just an Easter egg cause in black ops 1 mason had a mustang and a daughter named sally and on the loading screen you can see two guns in his hands and one of them says mustang and the other one says sally and you can get those guns in black ops 2 in zombies by pack-a-punching the starter pistol
Isn’t the name “Sally” also in the Call of duty Black ops 1 Home Screen ???!!??!???
“The professional” operator skin is actually based off of Steve Forsing portrayed by Jeffrey Donovan in the Sicario movie’s. The bundle is a dead giveaway i thought
It's a reference to the Sally 1911s from bo1
The name sally has been in the game forever, especially  sally 5, like...mustang and sally from when u pack-a-punch the starting pistol in cod zombies
Is you Mogawty tho???
Regardless of what anyone else would think, I believe it's a pretty cool coincidence that your likeness, and name end up in the game.
Sally was actually on woods 1911’s on the BO1 cover, it was a reference to that.
it’s a reference to BO1 if you couldn’t tell, on the game cover the person is wielding two 1911s and engraved on one is the name sally. Also in BO1 zombies, if you packed the 1911s it would become sally
🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢🧢
Mustang and sally are back <3  OGs remember them
Mustang and Sally?? Or are you joking
I feel like you did this to annoy black ops 1 fans
Yo just saying,what if they put captain bling bling In the game
Nope, I'm going with it being a reference to Mustang and Sally
no way they put him in bo1 zombies as well
So you're the most common lookin guy
This isn't a reference to you, stop thinking your special this is actually a reference to cod bo1 for the true fans who knew mustang and Sally were the guns on the cover
I really hope you’re being sarcastic
Nah it’s just an homage to “Mustang and Sally”
Everyone gets a phone call while playing warzone jordy got a sponsor deal while playing warzone, and then this guy  I should start leaving my phone on while playing warzone
“Sally llll” been around since BO1, that’s what the m1911 were called in zombies just saying... that’s not a bundle for you..
Its not u. Its a reference to mustang and sally from black ops one
Is that the Google Pixel 6 ?
Orr orrr orrrrr thats a bo1 mustang and sally reference lol
Who?
Were gonna pretend the pack a punched 1911s in zombies dont exist.... ok
LLL
Its not you 🤣🤣 if you look at the bo1 cover it clearly says “Sally” with lines as numbers
It’s not his blueprint it’s actually from bo1
Ok im lost who are you and how did you get in the game
Lol thats literally just a reference to Black Ops Mustang and Sally lol 😆 😂 🤣 😄 with the tally marks and everything.
How about you show steve respect considering he has the power enough to make you remembered in the greatest game ever
i have a friend with that name
As lit as this would be that's not what Sal means... sally is the name of the 1911 on the black ops one cover
It's from bo1 not for you
So who are u?
Sally was also on the gun on the front cover of black ops1
Didnt notice that all paid currency in cod is the same on the other games
*99% of the comments:* doesn’t get it.  *1% of the comments:* gets it.
Actually if you look in the bo1 title picture you will see a 1911 pistol saying Sally 8
I mean they all so had sally on the pistols in the cover of bo1
Whoa I have the same phone as this guy
Bro that's an Easter egg to the old mustang and Sally from bo1😐 its not your gun😐😐😐😐😐😐😐
Thats the sally thats on masons bo1 1911 i think
This bundle is based on zombies so it’s only right that they’d be connected to each other and not you
Sally is from the Black Ops 1 zombies storyline and it first appeared on the starter 1911 in the main title poster. It aint you this time.
BRUH his name ia literally SALLY🤣🤣🤣
So im in it too
I hate to do this, but it’s from the bo1 cover art where the guy is holding Mustang and Sally, which he named his pistols
Black ops reference people
Bro no that’s not true if you look on the old black ops games they have sally on the pistol
So flexes that he's wyatt then flexes a blueprint 😂
Ya no
Damn this video is trash
"I'm a Cod partner". That's why.
Intern Steve, I think I know that guy
What type of shit is that, dude looks stupid af honestly
Nice Google Pixel!
Really Sally is in the game but people that are actually recognized by Activision?  Ohhh, I get it now, he isn't really, added he's just trying to get people to use his supporter code on a shitty 2000 point bundle
Well in black ops 1 for the uncultured, on the cover art there were 2 1911’s named “Mustang and Sally” so that’s the reference
In bo1 the campaign image shows someone(maybe mason) holding 2 pistols and one of them says sally too
Uh no you are not in the game, that is a reference from the black ops 1 starter pistil in zombies when you pack a punch em. So in conclusion you are a click baiter
It’s a reference to mustang and sally from bo1 on the cover of the game the pistol has “sally” engraved in it
Lucky bastard
If you look closely at the Black ops 1 loading screen you see Sally on an m1911 in the left hand and the writing looks exact same as the one that's in the video
Bro this has 69k likes on the video 😂👌
It's not a reference to you well it might be but it's also a reference to an old cod character and there name was in the bo1 loading screen guys pistol
I’m gonna hate just bcz i’p so fucking jealous
Omg you're also on the black ops 1 box art!
It's a reference to the Sally and mustang pistols in bo2 zombies
Mustang and Sally. NO! This is Not a reference to this guy
orrrr.. ya know i saw woods in that bundle.. and woods being in black ops.. if you look at the front cover of black ops it says sally on the pistols which shows on the suppressor which makes a reference to that front cover and the pack a punch weapon “mustang and sally” sorry, the world does not revolve around you
Did you know sgt woods was modelled after me? Because my last name is woods?
Yeah but Wyatt is Aussie and your not
Sally was also the name of one of the guns in black ops one on the loading screen with those same marks
sally is from black ops zombies on 1911 lol
El MAAU gringo
it also has his name on it for an m16 blueprint 🤙🏽🤙🏽
Sally is from mustang and Sally ..
Black ops cover: Guy holding 2 pistols saying falling with 5 marks with man having two ars in the back            Sally: yEa GuYs IgOt My OWn BruEpinT
Are those Google Pixel phones he's holding?
Btw my small sister's name is sally
Sally was the name of the double pistols in bo2 zombies
How? !!😂
I’m still trying to wonder how are u even popular
sally is the name of the main characters 1911 in BO1 and the tally’s are how many kills “she has”
this fucking guy aggrivates me
I think it refers to mustang and sally the old PAP 1911’s from the older cod zombies modes
Haha nice
I got you Steve 😉
No one cares
That might be a reference to the Sally 1911 in bo1
He sounds like Samurai Guitarist!
Is he in the game as a character?
For the last time YOU DONT HAVE A SKIN ITS A COINCIDENCE
I personally think it’s a reference to the “mustang and sally” from call of duty black ops 1
I have searched all of the cosmos and still can't find who asked.
Sally with 5 right next to it, referencing Zombies... Not you... 🤦‍♀️
I thought the profesional was rayan reynalds
1 outta thousands of other players and he got his own skin and blue print? Nah deffently wasn't for him.  Might as well claim the mustang and Sally on the OG cod a well dual pack a punched 1911s.
it’s a reference to the pistols in the black ops one loading screen
why did youtube recommend this garbage
Sally was a name scratched on a gun in cod 1 I know that he was being sarcastic
Technically not in warzone, the blueprint is made for bo cold war, warzone is just the free game they made to seduce you into buying cold war/modern warfare
I ask you for a minute of your time to help me fulfill my dream of being an artist for the short time I have left in life I have cancer and I am disabled without friends why I cannot leave my house because of the bullying that they do to me why I was not lucky enough to have a good physique but I love myself as I am because that was what I got blessings and God bless you all

You know Sally was the name written on one of the pistolen in bo1 so this has nothing to do with you😂 it’s just that your name is Sally and the name on the gun was Sally
Yeah and they still made you buy it
All we need now is mustang
Idk wtf ur talking bout but I dropped a like for the effort you put into these vids
Bruh it's from Cod Bo1
Bro they put you on the bo1 cover too on the pistol it says sally
That’s not...
Today on things nobody asked or cared to know

Lol was not worth it

Sorry for the annoying promo, didn’t mean to annoy but I’m having great difficulty getting any exposure and idk what else to do🥺❤️ thank you did ur time, have a marvellous day ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Definitely not a black ops 1 reference
Your name is on cod black ops 1
Its a reference to bo
Why would you feel dead inside if you have cosmetics in the game? How about feeling blessed
What if        Sally WASNT a dog?
Waiting for Mustang.
Its not for you, its supposed to be mustang and sally.
God and Jesus loves you..John 3:16
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17- For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.

Amen.
You sure it’s not in reference to Mustang & Sally?
Bro I swear you think MW makes things for you that skin wasn't made after you it was made to mimick the guy from sicario you just named it and you happen to look like him not the other way around he came out before. And Sally has been on guns since black ops get the fuck outta here. Lol I hope everyone has a good
Even if it was referring to him the name Sally is his dogs so she would be in the game not him
Sally is a reference to mustang and Sally Mason's cars you might want to  cut his pay
intern looking gay
Damn why is it screw Steve?? 😂🤣
That’s actually dope
That’s actually the name of right duo pistols in cod bo1 (mustang & sally) it shows it on the cover of cod bo1 *dw ik it’s just a joke lol* just a little fun fact
Also every middle aged man has said that the professional is based off of them stfu
Love how no one understands that the blueprint is a bo1 reference
I know this is a game but sally is actually a reference to cod bo1. You know the 2 postals mason has, mustang and sally
You're not the only sally
thats gaa yyy
Mustang and sally?
Make my follow not pay Steve
Who cares
Is this cap because sally was wrote on the pistols in bo1?? I mean your legit but how legit is what you just said??
Noice A40 TR X-Edition
Mustang and sally from zom
And can I make a gun skin just in case if u would do it
Can u hack call of duty mobile
It's a black ops reference
It's not for him it's an reference to bo1 with the mustang and Sally's
That name is not for you and that operator is just randomly looking like u. Stop clickbaiting
Here's a story ab how i got my first win in warzone, there is no story actually 😤
One like one prayer for the intern
No you didn't it's on Masons gun on the b01 loading screen
The fact that jordy or sonic isnt in the game is weird
Cringe
You are taking credit for this ?? LMAO that carving is literally a easter egg for 1911 in BO1
I kinda feel sad for people not knowing that this was a sarcastic joke...     Now pay Steve dammit
my heart my mind my soul
Accept Jesus as Lord and Savior
I saw that the other day
Wot about YouTube
Sally I see ur playing on controller but how do you hold it with ur vingers?
He's intern looks like him twins?
Thats funny
anyone who believes this was actually for him 100% has never played any CoD that's before Advanced Warfare
Nice(ginger cop from South park)
Sad it'sa cold war pack
It's not his blue print it's just a old bo1 zombies reference
Very beautiful
“Wow look at my gun ooouu” stfu it’s a reference to bo1
It says sally on 1 of the m16 bps btw jus sayin
He's just using old gun names from zombies and the black ops 1 cover art to make it seem like he's in the game. If you didn't know in black ops 1 and 2 if you pack-a-punched the 1911 you got the mustang and Sally and on the black ops 1 cover case it says Sally on one of the 1911's with the carved out lines already
The name sally is also on a m16 blueprint if im right
Yeah scripted i already know
Wait a second it's your name that's in black ops 1 loading screen!
I’m understand how this is entertaining to people but then I just don’t
Mustang and Sally , the akimbo upgraded m1911 handgun from Black Ops 1 ,had this same engraving on the side of the pistol in your right hand .
So, I not seeing the connection. I mean I'm John, but don't think that Bungie named 117 after me. Geez my man.
I’m pretty sure it’s referencing sally as in the little girl from the zombies lore... not you 😂😂😂
Its the marine from sicario
Im pretty sure that's a reference or something to BO1 sally also this bundle was out for a while now
Im pretty sure that a reference to mustang and sally
Bro that’s sally from mustang and sally in bo1-bo2 n bo3 chronicles
Fuck Steve but I did start following this was like my 4 short of you doing warzone videos.  I personally like your tips your awesome.
Yeah bro, I've been playing bo1 for years and I dont think it's yours...
I’m guessing you never played Bo1
Mustang and Sally anynody rember
It means mustang and sally I believe from zombies
J
It’s a reference from bo2 the left pistol has sally on it
your names on a M16 blueprint too
First a skin from Sicario. Next a gun from BO1.
That isn't u that's a black ops easter egg one if the pistols on the cover is named sally
Sally is also written on black ops one on the pistols
Bruh 0:00
Plot twist Steve is sally 😳🙈😱🤯
Looks more like a call back to Sally from bo1 the 1911 that has "Sally" with some tally marks etched in the slide, But cool
i love steve pls pay him
Isnt that just a cod zombies reference?
Sally from zombies not him wtf
Orrrrr get this mustang and Sally from bo1 and bo2
I'm pretty sure this is referring to masons pistols "mustang and sally"
For all of you who dont know, thats "sally" from the iconic duo "mustang and sally" in bo2 zombies
That’s so sick
if you go back and look, the pistols on the black ops 1 cover also say sally.....
How big is your ego like do you actually think Activision put these things in the game because of you?
You gotta give some respect to steve bro, at least link his channel in the description.
let’s hope he doesn’t know ab  mustang and sally cuz that’ll just crush his dreams
Isn't this just a nod to the guns on the cover of black ops 1
man i love steve
Who is this guy..
Sally as in ‘Sally is a dog’ or Sally as in Mustangs friend Sally?
I got a gun for you the oden my setup is this  Monolithic suppresser  Oden factory 810mm Variable zoom scope  FMJ And the ranger foregrip Thank me later ━╤デ╦︻(·̿̿ĺ̯̿̿·̿ ̿)
The fara is kinda lit, just saying
if you look at the cod bo1 cover art, one of the guns has the name "sally" etched into it, and eight tick marks. Its actually a reference to that.      ik its sarcastic
Please feed him.
That is not your name 100% for the two 1911s in black ops
Man they really taking a liking to you
Can you do a class setup on the lc10
Vr content coming soon?
Noice
Mr.SallyIsADog your a legend keep do your thag my guy
at this point, I feel like that they're just doing this on purpose because they know who you are
I love his confidence to claim this shit lmao 🤣
Only real ones remember the mustang and Sally
Wow, Activision felt so bad for Steve not getting paid they added a weapon in ur name so he gets paid Pay him 😁
Yo where’s the striker 45
Damn one hour and zero dislikes
FINALLY STEVE GETS PAID!
haters would say its not for him
Nice!
can I hire steve for a few days Edit: don't worry i won't pay him
It a reference to Sally and mustang oh now I know were you got your name from cod zombie
Sup Sally. AN-94 is pretty good. Love the vids
Og sally not the dog sally 😂
Steve should’ve clutched a creator code.
I hope you got Steve that expensive phone and he did not get enough money to buy it by himself!
ik it's a nod to the mustang and sally but i'd love for it to be in dedication to sally is a dog
Just saying in the first bo1 loading screen where he holds the two 1911s you can see scratch on the sides of the guns the word Sally 5
Lol
He got 2 skins by both companies but still no support a creator is that a joke that I'm too normal to understand
"I'm white" "I'm black" "I'm yellow" "I'm red" "I'm dead on the inside"
Wait you too have people in your basement, wanna trade Steve for my kids
Well done Steve! Maybe we can get the guy a blanket down there?
