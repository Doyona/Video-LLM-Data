Joshua i hope you read this message, but you have no idea of how you transported me, these songs its like an hymn like imagine, and all people shall love each other, I am not from the USA, but i can tell by the music, how people in the USA sing this song in churches, and just smile and laugh, cause, we are made of love, from God's love, and you transported me to heaven, than you Josh very much for letting people know through your music and through your art that come from heaven that there is a God, a Good one that loves us so much, Josh definitely keep making music, you are amazing because I can see God through it.  Best wishes -Alondra
Amen Brother
Jag älskar låten det behöver jag Tack så mycket Ricky Bowen
Esse louvor é demais ❤🙏 deus é bom e o tempo todo deus é bom
This is one of the most emotional and heartbreaking music video I have ever seen in my life 😢
I don't think I've ever cried so much over a music video before; this was absolutely beautiful. The direction and the words at the end really spoke to me, since I know what it's like to struggle with depression and darker thoughts. I cannot thank you enough for this music, and I am so proud to see how far you've come
Beautiful. The ending was so inspiring that I you Joshua
Bro this song is a banger
This is so beautiful ❤
Happy 1 year anniversary of Just Love❤
Beautiful song ❤❤
Such a beautiful songgggg😭💕I love you Joshua
Omgggggg😭💕I cry throughout the song
Joshua, I’m going to your concert today radio music hall
Omg this is such an amazing video it shows the real life of people and also shows Jesus we all need to just love no matter how hard it gets
I was good. I made it to the end of the video and then read 10 years old Nd i folded.  There is something inherently wrong with a society that allows its future generations to perish needlessly. NEEDLESSLY. Man that hurts my heart so much. 😭😭😭
MAKE HEAVEN CROWDED!!!!!
eu amo essa musica
PRAISE GOD for the way you’re representing the love of Jesus to our broken world. Thank you Joshua for being a light and being bold with your platform ❤️
It made me literally cry. He's so talented and kindhearted.
🌻🍀🤍💫
well this video made me not want to see you in concert (two guys holding hands - double check your scriptures its pretty clear about this (and in many different places)

Tell me I'm not the only 1 who noticed this but Jake Clark is in josh's video!!!
Galatians 6:1  Brothers, if anyone is caught in any sin, you who are spiritual [that is, you who are responsive to the guidance of the Spirit] are to restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness [not with a sense of superiority or self-righteousness], keeping a watchful eye on yourself, so that you are not tempted as well.  1 Corinthians 5:9-13  9 I wrote you in my [previous] letter not to associate with [sexually] immoral people— 10 not meaning the immoral people of this world, or the greedy ones and swindlers, or idolaters, for then you would have to get out of the world and human society altogether! 11 But actually, I have written to you not to associate with any so-called [Christian] brother if he is sexually immoral or greedy, or is an idolater [devoted to anything that takes the place of God], or is a reviler [who insults or slanders or otherwise verbally abuses others], or is a drunkard or a swindler—you must not so much as [e]eat with such a person. 12 For what business is it of mine to judge outsiders (non-believers)? Do you not judge those who are within the church [to protect the church as the situation requires]? 13 God alone sits in judgment on those who are outside [the faith]. Remove the wicked one from among you [expel him from your church].
Everybody should support this artist and share his content this is the kind of music we need to hear in the world❤ share him on social media platforms ❤🎉
❤❤❤❤❤ love this 🎵  song great job ❤❤
Bana filistin davasını anımsatıyor
Josh, there’s a lot of rumors and misinformation about you. Sexuality is a spectrum, and honestly, who cares if you’re straight, gay, bi, queer, whatever. This is a beautiful song, i’m so impressed and happy that I listened. Nearly brought me to tears man (and that’s not easy!!) Thank you for putting this into the world and I hope your message is heard by those who somehow keep missing the point.
I'm so depressed right now and this song is getting me by for the moment. Thank you. 😢 I feel so alone.
Keep making music.
He looks so much like young Justin Timberlake
i recently found God and i feel so saved ! so proud of you J❤
Omg I forgot how amazing you music is❤❤❤❤
This song came out the day after my dad got divorced to my step mom. And this song really fixed me
im austick thank u joshua just love is right keep doing good work my dude
Joshua Bassett is one kind guy
i also think this is showing a great representation of whats wrong with churches as well sometimes.  i remember when i was younger, anyone that i personally had known that when to church, even my grandparents, werent opening those doors for certain parties who are wanting a church to go to. turning away lgbtq+ members, people of color and different ethnicities, homeless who genuinely just wanted to believe in a god. i stopped going with my grandparents because as a child, why was gods love limited to straight white people?   truth is, it wasnt. and it still isnt. but there’s still churches that believe that unfortunately. and i think joshua pointed out that flaw beautifully in this video, but also without degrading the fact HE still believes and wants others to be included no matter who they are.
this music video made me cry, it’s perfectly made ❤
💜🙏💜
Thank you Josh
this came out at the perfect time. ive dealt with depression and anxiety and the feelings of being alone. Keeping your hurt quiet is not the answer. Talk to someone that will love you.
This kid will definitely go to places😭 Luv him alott and his workk❤
This made me cry. It's such a beautiful song/video. You have such a sweet soul, and I love all that you stand for ❤ I hope you're doing well, Josh ❤
K i fell down a rabbit hole to find this music , thanks to your gf ❤
I love how he is a believer and isnt afraid to say it 😊
His voice is so soothing to me like a lullaby in a good way and his music makes me feel loved
”Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his one and only Son into the world so that we might live through him. Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.“ ‭‭1 John‬ ‭4‬:‭7‬-‭10‬ ‭CSB‬‬  True love goes out of one’s way to do what is best for others. Love is selfless. Love is Jesus dying in our place. Love is being a living example of this great love given to us, by loving others the same way. I love y’all! And this song is a good one!
Love love love  What if we just  Love ?? I’m I asking too much ? Joshua thank you 🙏
Oh my gosh he’s so sweet i love joshua!❤
a song for a cause, Lots of Love
not a christian here but i love the song, including the beautiful message, very very much!
Bro, I almost cried, this is so sweet. I love the message, especially the part where you addressed the church turning its back to those who need help. I just went to a conference about the same topic last night, this song is so true, and people don’t always like the truth, but you are the best for this dude, Love you Josh, Big love man ❤❤❤
I love this song the high school musical was very good two! He looks much different
A Cringy video.
This is my all time favorite song because it captures what I believe the Church should be. Jesus would never cut anyone off from His love, He would accept them with open arms. As Christians, we need to be more like this, amazing Joshua!!
voetsake only poeple from south africa will i understand what i said but im sayin that because why would u do that to olivia and sabrina whats wrong with u?  and i not tyring to rude if u think im  rude not my prop sorry fans of him i just  cant  he must stop  breaking hearts 😡 but please joshua if u want to love love  truley thats all and thank u😁
Are you a Christian
If Joshua sees this I am gonna die I wish he will se worth trying right? Joshua you are gifted with nice voice. Thank you for reading this
This is a beautiful song inspired by the love of God. So many people can be touch by you trough your music and the love it shows. Continue to spread the one and only love that exists and we know💞
This song was a masterpiece for the song I was playing on my way home and it made my heart happy to see the music ❤❤❤❤❤❤love you josh
I just listened to this song and I’m wondering how it hasn’t gotten more views
Joshua your songs are so beautiful you are my idol and will always be
You’re awesome JB
this is going to make me cry, this song is so good, and i love how the mv is done, joshua appears like a literal angel and even though im not religious, i love this so much
This makes me love my church and everyone even more😢
Did you know there's a chick on cop body cam claiming she dates you.? She said I don't have his phone  #, we talk on his fan page (it's when entitled girls think they're above the law, Detective Cooper, here on YouTube)
FORGIVENESS (Start With Healing Version)  Some people might say you shouldn't forgive and forget the people  who've wronged you,  but what IF... I want to FORGIVE  and forget about all of it? what IF... I don't want to hold any grudges against others?  Having FORGIVENESS doesn't make you a person people can walk all over without consideration of your feelings. Having forgiveness makes you a good person,  and maybe one reason for wanting to forgive people is because YOU don't want to hurt anymore. You don't want THEM to hurt either!  Some people might say you shouldn't put things behind you,  but what IF... I WANT to put things behind me, because anger won't make things easier or better for ME?  And also... even if THEY won't FORGIVE ME, it'll make ME feel good if I FORGIVE THEM, and it's my choice if I want to do that!  Having FORGIVENESS is sometimes necessary, because during the smallest of arguments, people say the wrong thing  Without realising what they're saying. Being forgiving doesn't make you a  weak person,  it makes you a STRONG one!  ©️ 2022 Joshua Burlison Mindful poetry
amazing
It seems like joshua bassett is in the sequel to M3GAN
Joseph Fletcher, with his situation ethics, and agape would love this. Philosophy and ethics students
O M G 😂😂
This was sad message but it showed that the world we live in is broken
Beautiful portrayal Jesus Christs love of all of us. May you all find peace and joy and know that YOU ARE LOVED. You matter. Thank you so much Joshua Bassett for making this beautiful message. May you all find love and peace and I am grateful for the love of all people on earth❤️❤️
IM OBSESSED!
God bless you always ❤
Josh, i just wanted to say i love the way you spread love, thank you for making my day better.
Jesus loves you ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ironic when he says “while the innocent die” and shows a picture of a soldier 🤣, them bitches are not innocent
❤
“Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. Anyone who does not love does not know God because God is love. In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent His only Son into the world, so that we might live through Him. In this is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” 1 John 4:7-21
ur amazing, thanks 4 ur art and the light that u share <3 idol
i am very sad you broke up with Olivia
You are such a bright light in this world, giving us love and support in a beautiful song, this world is fucking broken, if we supported each other, changed for the better, how much would it give for us all to be on the same page, this song and the music video is amazing and emotional, I'm so proud of you, you understood it all, thank you for such beautiful words, Te amo 🧡
Eres una luz tan brillante en este mundo, dándonos amor y apoyo en una hermosa canción, este mundo está jodidamente roto, si nos apoyáramos unos a otros, cambiáramos para bien, cuánto daría para que todos estuviéramos en la misma página, esta canción y el video musical es increíble y emotivo, estoy tan orgulloso de ti, lo entendiste todo, Te amo 🧡
Holy moly this song and music video are beautiful, thank you for spreading love
Great song Joshua! ❤
I love your songs. I can’t wait for the next.

Happy Birthday🎉
i love u josh
Excellent
BEAUTIFUL MASTERPIECE
love this song
Love is what we don’t have. But it’s something we all need give, spread and share ❤️‍🩹
This is probably the most unoriginal and boring song i've ever heard
Josh im french sorry but il love your serie hum hing shcool musiqual this serie ❤❤❤
Love your neighbor as yourself God bless you all
Keep spreading God's love! I'm enchanted by this song 🥹
John 15:12-13 “My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.”
Amen
i have such a personal connection to Joshuas music 😭☺
the best song ever
I love this so much
Came here again to say this is your worse song Josh.
Disgusting not gonna lie The song’s amazing but gay isn’t
Por favor, no vendas tu talento al diablo como los otros artistas!
Beautiful
I absolutely love this we all needed this ❤
Wow you put a smile on God’s face for the courage of putting out this song. You’re right, the only way we can change the world is with love.  (Also just an fyi, the Catholic Church in its essence does not keep anyone out. Not gay people or anyone. God calls us to love everybody because we are all sinners.
It's so nice that he explains color discrimination. This was probably the most beautiful and meaningful clip I've ever watched💞💞💞
Thank you Joshua 🙏🏼
Hey Joshua, this song was such an encouraging message to show love to everyone and not just a selected few. To show a sacrificial and unconditional love which is rare to find in our world these days. I pray and hope that you continue to grow in God and that you continue to be a testimony to all and never lose hope. May God bless you!!!
You're so kind and I love how you share your feelings in the song
What makes me smile are people who respect and love me. Words, actions, and facial expressions filled with hate only cause harm. I hope this beautiful song heals many people and makes everyone fall in love.❤️
Lol not even half a million view. Cheaters deserve
Como uma voz dessa sai de um ser tao pequeno. Lindo❤
i dont get why josh isnt get Millions of views  or subs...
Christians are meant to be an example for others and love first like Christ before us ( 1 John 4:8; Ephesians 5; 1 Corinthians 13; 2 John 1:6; Romans 12:9; and many others). However, we must not glaze over the truth and the sadness that this world will continue to have for now. I like this video.
Every scene , Every lyric , and every moment puts me into happy tears.. it is great knowing that their are artists out their who are God's children. Josha is showing love just like Jesus said we should. God is good.. 😌✨️💗
I love you ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ and your music
❤️❤️❤️
This is amazing ❤❤❤
Amazing message! Thx Josh, I love it
always be my mainstream
This song is Just perfect for the current situation of wars happening in various places, iykuk 🪖
Good songs bout ‘love’ but to get the love, you must find the love by the sources of love  = God and understanding what is kind of love not just said i love you but really tell you the truth for you to be best versions of yourself.. and take it correctly
Thank you God for the life of Joshua Bassett.
This just made me cry❤️ Jesus is using you so beautifully Josh so incredibly proud and thankful you put this message out there❤️
The world will be a better place if everyone can forgive and love each other
The symbolism the camera work the voice the outfits the visuals the directing the thought everything together to make this work of art I can say this song will live on within my family thank you josh for giving the world a message people can get behind
this is the most beautiful song and message I have ever heard in my life
I’m a Christian but I have struggled with so much. I have felt judged and I have seen other judged harshly. I have been very lost and confused because of the differing opinions around me. I have a hard time sticking up for myself and others. By sticking up for myself I mean just wanting love and a place to be myself. This gives me hope for what heaven is going to be like. And what the world could be. That is why I keep going and keep my faith strong. Whoever is reading this I want you to know a couple things. God loves you no matter what. You are enough. And you are so loved by others even if you can’t see it. You are strong. And you will get through it. 💕💕💕
💖💖💖💖💖💝
Ur song really good ❤️
Best music video i have ever watched. this is so sweet to see <3 I've listened to you for so long and i literally love this song and how you have transformed your life. So important to hear this, and i hope this message spreads    100% fav music artist ever
Jesus said: Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light. ‭‭- Matthew‬ ‭11‬:‭28‬-‭30‬ ‭
seeing openly queer, religious youth gives me so much happiness 😭💙
please what’s the song?
Josh, as someone who has survived a suicide attempt I thank you so much for this song. Here I am almost three years clean and attempt free. Music has always been my way to cope. I was in class when I first heard this and I couldn’t stop crying because the scene of the boy on his bed crying was just so relatable. I’m going thru a rough time wit my anxiety, but this isn’t just helps so much. Love you!
praise God for always being the answer, love u Joshua
The light of Jesus is shining through you and I can see it🤍 I’m beyond happy and so proud of you. Lots of love Joshua 💗
The church doors are closed To those who need most The love that's inside, mmm And the black ties, they fight 'Bout who's wrong or right While the innocent die, mmm  An eye for an eye leaves Everyone blind, we We can't seem to see the way, oh 'Cause everyone's hurting Tell me, when will we learn it And what more can I say?  But what if we just Love, love, love? What if we just Love, love? Am I askin' too much? Oh, oh Too many have lost their lives and Too many tears we've cried 'cause We couldn't seem to see the light But what if we just Love, love, love?  Now you're all by yourself And you're crying for help But they don't hear a sound And your walls know too well You've been living in hell Tell me what to do now, oh  Well, don't you get tired When you run for your life? Yeah Oh, you don't need to this time  What if we just (Just) love, (just) love, (just) love? What if we just (Just) love, (just) love, (just) love? Oh Too many have lost their lives and Too many tears we've cried 'cause We couldn't seem to see the light But what if we just Love, love, love? What if we just (Just) love, (just) love, (just) love?  But what if we just love? We just love
love love love this
Joshua Bassett just love💃🔥💃🔥
I love this song so much❤ I’m 15, a freshman in high school, and a Christian. I honestly didn’t think high school would be too different from middle school, but it’s a pretty big change. I love your story and I’m so proud of you for coming back from where you were, Josh:) your songs are amazing, keep on writing!!😜🤟
Great Message.
I ONLY JUST FOUND THIS AND IM VERY SCARED BC IT SAYS TWO WEEKS AGO AND I MISSED THIS OMG  ALSO IS THEE MORE IS THER A WHOLE ALUN # HELP ME edit: just checked and luckily i didnt miss anything else phew edit 2: i am now seeing shorts and im scared did i miss more songs or are they unreleased sections
👋💛💙🔊🎧
The chruch hurt. The worldly pain. The crosses and syombols of jesus christ throughout the video. The message of love, not hate. Thi is exactly how us christans should portray ourselves. THANK YOU JOSHUA❤ IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU AHHHH❤❤❤
This was beautifully put Joshua! Our day and age is so corrupted I feel like. We need more people like you. This was inspiring! And I loved it!
Currently in tears, this was so beautiful. My younger cousin recently tried to take his life by overdose then jumping but it was unsuccessful after the attempts he came to me and i was with him for the rest of the night and all i could do was hold on to him and let him know how loved he is it took a long time but he's still here today so thank you for showing the world how quickly love can change a persons heart cause i know it changed someone in my life🥹🫶🤍
This is what fame should be about. Spreading important messages that need to be spread, heard, talked about and changed!
🫶🫶🫶🫶
Josh is literally one of my favourite celebrities. I loveee his story , it's so so inspiring. He isn't afraid to talk about god (he literally can be canceled because he is a Christian and he still talks 👏) I loveee the vibes of his songs. You can also see the maturity of his songs if you know what I mean . I love you joshy , keep doing what you're doing and never give up for anyone , god loves you a lot 💗💗💗💗
Hey Josh, I don’t know if you’ll see this but I wanted to say that you saved my life. I had to go to a school that hurt me really bad. Everyone hated me and ur music just helped. I really don’t know what else to say. This song is amazing. I’m so thankful you are on this earth and can help people that really need u. I wish you all the best in life.
It reminds me of Jesus bc he loves us all and pulls us out of the darkness
I'm in tears after this!! I was so ready for a comeback at Olivia, but this is way better!!. The way Joshua sings it amazingly, the lyrics are just beautiful!! Olivia is telling us to hate, Joshua is telling us to "Just Love." ❤️🤍
Im not really living for the faith era but like… slay?
This song is amazing ❤😊
This is the most beautiful song. I listen to it on repeat. Good work Josh ❤
Joshua‘s videos are always the best constantly amazed
Chills
Omg i didnt know there was a video ah love
1:24 love the rainbow touch✝🕊
Awesome, emotional song Josh. As Christians we are called to be a witness to those who don’t know God. To those who’ve lost so much. And been through some crazy stuff. Keep spreading the message Josh.
best song i have ever heard, thank you for spreading the message and word. Thank you for spreading the love ❤❤❤ i love how you can tell the Lord has helped him. No hate no judgment no nothing. Just Love 💗💕💓
pretty isn't pretty
I think this is one of the best songs he as ever written it made me cry you are so talented in my ways God has really blessed you with an amazing voice😊
🤍🤍🤍
This is so awesome to see, I just finished HSMTMTS and I wanted to come check out his music AND I’m still a babe in Christ (since July) so I love this wow
Joshua, this is incredible. It's really amazing to see you spread this message, and really seem to find your way. I couldn't be any more proud of any other celebrity at this moment.
We need another version with jake singing aswell
🥹💖
this is the most beautiful thing i ever heard and seen💜
Ilyyyyy
My guy has a point here. The church closed the doors to the lost, those in need, and the people struggling in every way. We’re suppose to be open towards them and love, help, and lead them through which they can find God and feel His peace and His love, then help others in that same position they were once
Creo que nunca me había conmovido tanto una canción y un vídeo musical 😢❤️
beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. thank you 🙏🏼
Thank you for raising awareness and spreading love! Your music helps me so much when I'm stressed out! Sharing love with family, friends and strangers on the street is so important!
the love of Christ is what we need ...amen
its about relationship with Jesus , not man made religion ❤
The message at the end really drove it home. All of those things can end with love
Awesome love this and thank you you are awesome too keep up the good work live your dream on peace ❤🎉😊
I feel like jobs ha basset is an incarnation of Jesus Christ 😮😮😮😮
So I was walking with my friend and this was crazy I was going through a hard time like I needed to decide who to love my current girlfriend Sydney or this boy named Cae who liked me too and I was stressed so I just asked god who is someone I should love and as I walked I saw Sydney name spelled across the sidewalk big and clear made from nature was is god
Such a simple message, but so essential in crazy times like these. "What if we just love"🤧. Thank you Joshua, this is everything, everything we need to hear🤧
Goosebumps every second
This was beautiful Josh!
❤❤❤❤
this is beautiful
As a Christian this breaks my heart josh. Im so sorry for all the church hurt and all the wrongs you saw in Christians. That was not a correct representation of how we are called to love by God. That was the sin in people. I pray you come back to the Lord and understand his love for you and what it actually means to LOVE. Beautiful song😢
Lovely track.
thank you.. for being bold and sending the message to this terrible world.. a lot of people have learning/loving to do and ppl like you make difference, trust me.
ugh Lord, Joshua is a beautifully imperfect example of how everyone in the Hollywood business should be (and beyond).. I absolutely love you Joshua! I am SO proud of you, and being a junior singer/songwriter, watching someone like you make a difference, and I mean a good difference.. I'll be here to support you every step of the wayy! JUSTT LOVEEE!!!!
Yeah love must be always the one who wins because everything was great with love😍💖💝
Thank you for sharing the light of Christ. The world needs this and more❤
this hit me really hard. i’ve hated myself for years and have started self harm. we need more love in our lives. thank you josh for being an advocate and showing so much love <3
bless Joshua Bassett for life. thank you for spreading such a crucial message. your artwork is beautiful and reverberates through the soul. His light clearly shines through him; he is a beacon amidst the darkness. i don’t tend to be one for celebrities but if there’s one to support, it’s someone whose mission is to spread genuine love in the name of Jesus, for the people. praying for only the best for JTB and anyone who may be reading this.
Joshua, MDS, eu ainda estou em lágrimas, escuto essa música desde o lançamento mas só agr q vi o clipe, e mdss, que mensagem, eu n estava esperando por isso, desde que a música começou a tocar no clipe as lagrimas começaram a cair, a letra e o clipe mexeram mt cmg. Parabéns rapaz, vc tem Mt talento e vai mt longe
So powerful.. ❤️ love this message, reminds me of Jesus revolution for some reason
Wow I am blown away. Haven't really listened to much of Josh's music before, this was my first video. I  had tears in my eyes watching this, I think it's very relatable and it has a very strong message. It ends with us.
it ends with Jesus.
I love how you advertised in the middle of a Toronto first Nations event so silly josh
So necessary, thank u for that 🤍 I love u, Jesus love u
❤❤❤
I'm so beyond proud of you!
Another great song Joshua keep it going 👌💯
I'm not usually a crier, but man, Josh when you walked past the parents fighting and grabbed the child then grabbed the teenager and gave them a hug. I represented both as me who's currently living around parents who hate each other and it's getting really hard for me. I'm in my kitchen right now and my dad is in the next room over, I had to physically hold my face back from sobbing like a very loud baby... I have no words... God is all I have right now, and I know I don't have a physical savior to come and rescue me, but I just imagined Jesus holding me telling me it was ok and that was what I needed to hear. I don't know how you captured such strong emotions in only 4 minutes, but you did and that deserves much more than a thank you, but alas that's all I have so here it is if you ever read this. I really wish I could've heard this when you were on tour, I got to come to your second SF show and it was one of the best nights of my life!
What an amazing song.❤❤❤
i'm sobbing, this is so important, ly josh<3
He never disappoints anyone. I love the mean and the background of the song.❤
3:35 that vocal flip right there🙂...no words.... amazing
Love
Not big on faith but this hits hard, theres so many times i want to give my younger self a hug and pull them out of the situations i was put in, to say it gets better
Dear Joshua thank you for everything this is si beautiful and unique im so proud of you i can't describe how beautiful this song makes me feel so let's just love 💝
such a beautiful powerful song Josh❤️❤️
I don’t think I have ever been prouder to be a fan of him! As a Christian this hits different😭 spread love! Our future is soo bright🫶🏽
i love this song and this man
🥹💖
If this song and video wasn’t emotional enough. It’s reading all of the incredible comments. Amazing work Josh.
finally speaking for the truth ✊
ur my hero
Okay when is he coming to Australia
Wow Josh you are amazing the Lord really has touched your heart thank you for spreading his word. ❤❤
how the hell is this not trending
This shit put me to tears cuz it's so true, there so many problems in this world that were all struggling with😢❤ it reminds me of when my mom and dad were still together when I was 3 my brother was 2 and the twins weren't born yet but my mom had serious issues and was very verbally abusive to me mostly and my brother and I was very afraid of her up till I got older (I'm 19 now) treated me and my siblings like garbage. I finally stood up to her because she was very out of line we almost got handsy to be honest, I still love her regardless but I don't tolerate that shit❤
Joshua, you are such a light in a dark world.  I know you have struggled and so have I , it is an epidemic in the world we live in.   But you inspire others with your love and compassion.  I truly hope and pray you have found peace and know that you are deeply loved  and matter in this world.  God is so good Joshua and it makes me so proud the work you are doing for Him.  Congratulations on directing the video as well.
wow, wow, wow...what an amazing song!
Joshuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤
Love the message you’re spreading Josh!!! Keep doing what you’re doing, love your songs❤️

YAS KING 🔥 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
this was so incredibly beautiful
God bless you! We need this kind of music ❤ Make a change ❤️
Me when I leave a church that doesn’t actually close it’s doors to those in need and get baptized in a church that is adamantly anti-lgbt and pro trump but also am part of lgbt community and hey guys war is bad and abusive parents are bad I would know my parents weren’t abusive
🫂🙌🏻💖💜💖
Such a beautiful song. Honestly Touches my heart. Love the ending sm-!!
The church doors are closed To those who need most The love that's inside, mm And the black ties, they fight 'Bout wrong or right While the innocent die, mm  [Pre-Chorus] An eye for an eye leaves Everyone blind, we We can't seem to see the way, oh 'Cause everyone's hurtin' Tell me, when will we learn it? And what more can I say?  [Chorus] But what if we just Love Love Love What if we just Love Love Am I askin' too much? Oh Too many havе lost their lives and Too many tears wе've cried 'cause We couldn't seem to see the light But what if we just Love Love Love  [Verse 2] Now you're all by yourself And you're cryin' for help But they don't hear a sound And your walls know too well You've been livin' in hell Tell me what to do now, oh  [Pre-Chorus] Well, don't you get tired When you run for your life?

Love the song 💞🥹
The world needs more songs like this.
When he picked up the kid I started crying... This healed me fr
Im not really religious because of a lot of reasons but this video shows that religion is not something that makes us different, its something that can bring us together without anyone having to hide who they really are and what they believe in:)
Literally just. Love.
It's magnificent. I'm wondering how this is possible that this amazing messeage dosen't have more views. Thanks for this <3.
Loving is important but we can’t stop there. We need to become politically active if we want to actually change things. We can’t end all those horrifying statistics by just loving. What actions are we taking to change things?
Beautiful song ❤
Badly needed this song. ♥
Beautiful. Can’t lie and say I didn’t cry.
I love this message, thank you Joshua❤
Jesus is moving in this mans life. It's so encouraging to see him use his gift from God to advance His kingdom!
Incredible!
Ugh this is a word! His heart is beautiful
Joshua, you have grown, congratulations!!
Thank you for spreading a good message. So proud of where you are!
This is beautiful. Thank you for spreading Jesus's love
❤❤❤❤
QUE MÚSICA LINDA, CRISTO VIVE!!❤️‍🔥
This is just amazing Joshua! It really captures what people go through on a daily basis and shows everyone how much just loving someone and spreading kindness can do. Great work. ❤
God bless you Josh!!
Com Deus e o seu amor somos livres de todos os males que existem nesse mundo! Que mensagem PODEROSA Joshua! THANKS FOR SPREAD THIS MENSAGE OF GOD AND YOUR LOVE! ILY
obrigado.
Finding God is Finding Joy, love and completeness. He’s all we need. I just hope we’re able to tell many more people what they have and that they are not alone.
this is perfection I love this.
This is exactly what every church should be like, open and full of love! This is why I’m a christian!
i’ve been praying for Joshua for a few years now - since his first ever song! what an incredibly kind hearted, gentle soul he is, love this song!✨🤍🙏
You create a MASTERPIECE here josh, thank you for putting your idea into your director dream and i bet a lot of people needed to hear and see this video (i'm one of them) Amen to that 🙏✨ Just Love ♥️
🥲❤
Just wow. This is so beautiful. Thank you for sharing this with the world Josh, needed this today and everyday to come.
josh, you’ve really did it again. i love you for all that you do.
this is me🤍 thanks for this, josh
this is an absolute beautiful video and beautiful message being spread. I loved it. 🤍
Jesus Christ was a loving person, just as God wanted him to be. He fed the poor, the needy, and stood up for the outcasts. He would never condone all the hatred, oppression, and violence he sees today. He freed the enslaved, fought for equality, and knew it was all in good faith. And yet, even after all of this, he was hated. He was punished for crimes he did not commit, and the world turned against him. Because Jesus Christ was a good person, and the world was not so good. He was good anyways. Let's be like Jesus.  "I came not to bring peace, I came to draw the sword" Mathew 10:34-36
You know, many years ago, I wanted to kill myself. Yet after everything, I'm still here. When you think it's the end, it's not. One day, your happiness will be greater than the pain. Keep going.
This music made cry
This is so beautiful. I have loved seeing Joshs music develop and him release songs with so much meaning in them ❤
Wow, your work and songwriting is so admiring. Thank you so so much for this and helping everyone who just needs a little bit of love.
I cry like a baby watching this clip. Well done Joshua ❤
And also you are really really a genius. With a really big heart ♥️……..Joshua basset, ❤ you are right……why we don’t just love?
I. Love. This.
This is soooo good!!! Love u josh! ❤
To Love...that's what God put us on this earth for. To spread Gods love to everyone, and show them the light. I am a Christian and growing up a christian your parents tell you whats right from wrong, but who's to say they are right themselves. Judgement day has that name for a reason, Judging is God's job, not ours. Our Job is to spread love. This song is a perfect representation of that. This song is what the world needs. Thank you Joshua bassett!
so so glad Joshua seems to have found Christ and his heart is definitely in the right place! but this song serves a weak and watered down message. saying "just love" takes away from the power of Christ. anyone can just love, but only Christ's love can truly change a soul.
this is so so so beautiful
Loving others no matter opinion, lifestyle, or outward appearance is exactly what the Savior did and still does! He believed in those that didn't believe in themselves and gave them power to be become more like Him because of that. That power is still very real! Thank you for spreading His message in a world full of hatred and contention.
this is reason number 1000 why i love joshua basset.
❤❤❤😢😢😢
May the Lord bless you and use you to be a light in the darkness. 🤍
Every guy I like is gay   Said Olivia Rodrigo
Josh you've such a bright smile ❤
Everyone needs to hear this beautiful song! Thank you Joshua for this song.   Love can restore everything. ❤
❤️‍🔥
The director, songwriter and singer that you are
You ate 💋💋
I'm in my 30s and have suffered from anxiety, depression and all sorts since being in my teens. I haven't been religious and don't think I will ever be, but I find peace when listening to music sometimes and bloody hell Joshua's music is giving me mixed emotions - I cry and smile, then feel happy. I regret not knowing about Joshua years ago, but glad I now do. His music is just beautiful, I love how he includes his personal and vulnerability in his lyrics too.
[Verse 1] The church doors are closed To those who need most The love that's inside, mm And the black ties, they fight 'Bout who's wrong or right While the innocent die, mm  [Pre-Chorus] An eye for an eye leaves Everyone blind, we We can't seem to see the way, oh 'Cause everyone's hurtin' Tell me, when will we learn it?

This made me sob like just lifeline ever has
Joshua Bassett, you're an angel! We need more people like you to guide us and lend a hand. I wish I was brave and magical like you.
Jesus is the light and love. This is so amazing Joshua! Your testimony is powerful and your platform is being used to bring light to the darkness just like Jesus calls us to do. Keep it up! Praying for more outpouring of His Spirit to come into your life!!🩷
Joshua, God love you more than you could ever imagine, you´re so important, always pursue you call, do all the thing only for Him, again, He loves you
I'm crying, it's a beautiful song and I want to say that it is very complicated for me to see how people suffer... many times it has given me courage to see how thousands of lives are lost due to problems that do not concern them... how they discriminate against you for have a disability or a person with different abilities... my little brother has down syndrome and it is very difficult for me not to get angry when I hear how they laugh at these people... Currently my family and I are Catholics and I really like them. I am glad that you have instructed me on your path because I don't know what I would be without your wisdom... Joshua, you have written one of the best songs I could have heard in my life... congratulations    Estoy llorando, es una hermosa canción y quiero decir que es muy complicado para mí ver como la gente sufre... muchas veces me ha dado coraje ver como miles de vidas se van por problemas que no les incumben... como te discriminan por tener una discapacidad o a una persona con habilidades diferentes... mi hno pequeño tiene sindrome de down y es muy complicado para mi no darme coraje cuando escucho como se rien de estas personas... Actualmente mi familia y yo somos católicos y de verdad me alegra que me hayan instruido por su camino pq no se que seria de mi sin su sabiduría... Joshua has  escrito una de las mejores canciones que pude haber escuchado en mi vida... felicidades
I love this!!
This made me cry so hard, thank you ❤
I just had my Mama listen to this song. The whole time, she had tears in her eyes. This song has so much meaning and power to it. Thank You for being an amazing person, Joshua Bassett. We Love You.❤
Joshua, this song!! ❤
Ima finna cry so good josha ❤😢❤
😭🙏🏼So beutiful🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻❤️❤️
is it about olivia or sabrina
My God, I feel this ❤️❤️❤️it hurt....I cried with this song Joshua we love you 😢
I just don't get why or how every Joshua Bassett's song makes me cry... like, bro! It's his voice, his lyrics? I don't know... BUT I LOVE HIM
damn the kid playing piano while the parents fighting hit home
I love this :)
This is so powerful. I've never seen topics like these discussed and portrayed so well. You did so well Josh.❤
Que lindo Joshua! Eu amei ❤
So good 🙏🏼🙌🏼🫶🏻
this was beautiful. I'm crying
Seeing that kid depressed really teared me up 😭
Amazing song!!❤❤😭😭
thank you josh.
one of your best yet!
I love at the end when he took them to church
Beautiful song!!!
I love this song and it’s message so much.
HOW DID I NOT SEE THIS UNTIL NOW??
the song and mv is so beautiful 😢😍🥹 thank you Josh for always spreading love and positivity you are just amazing and I love you so much
SO GOOD I LOVE YOU SO MUCH JOSH
What a beautiful song ❤
That was so beautiful🥹 when he brought everyone into the church while holding the little boy😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️   ***by the way guys, any church that doesn’t make you feel welcome is not a good church and does not reflect or represent Gods love. Find a different church that accepts you as you are just like Jesus does, and will really help show you who God is and how much he truly loves us❤
Powerful!
You saved my life Joshua ❤️ I’m eternally grateful
God bless you Josh 🫶🏻🙏🏻
literally gave me goosebumps
what a beautiful song and what an important message 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
May the Lord be praised for the work He is doing in your life, Joshua 🤍
It is so amazing to see a man so on fire for God.
He’s such a genuinely good human and inspiring fr
😢😢❤❤❤❤❤
Im not crying…
To all those who said it was creepy that Josh suddenly became Christian, I originally was concerned for him too. However, with this song and music video, I can see that he is doing okay. I really love his message of love and acceptance. As a Christian myself, I have seen and heard of too many times that the church has wronged people, so much so to the point that at times I am ashamed to be associated with it. The church has become too obsessed with being "right". However, these judgments need to end. The true teachings of Jesus are to love one another as the Lord has loved you and leave the judgment to God. I know it doesn't make up for the centuries of abuse from the church, but I sincerely apologize as a Christian today for the hurt they have caused. Also as someone who has dealt with severe mental health struggles, I hope everyone who is hurting or struggling with mental health will find the courage to ask for help and be able to heal.
This song hit me really hard but I want to thank Josh for everything he has helped me and many others through. We love you Josh more than you know. ❤❤❤❤❤🙏🙏 (I love that Jake Clack is in this. I love both of you.)
God Bless you everyone. Jesus loves you. Jesus says come as you are, you do not need to change who you are.✝️🤍🙏🏻✨
I was scared when I saw you joined the church. It's one thing to love God and pray, but the church is a whole different place. I do not go to church anymore because I do not feel welcome anymore. But this video shows me that God is using you to show his grace and love for all. That all our welcome in his house! Thank you for this ❤
Eu não tenho palavras pro tamanho do talento desse homem, como pode?!!!! Ele merece todo o reconhecimento do mundo !!
This is amazing!! wow, I love it!! I am proud of you and that new love that is growing in you. Friend and brother, your days will never be the same. Today your battles will be with God. This means that there will always be ups and downs, but with God in the equation everything is better. I have been a Christian for 15 years and it is the most exciting adventure of my entire life. I love him, I love his miracles that he has done in my life and that unconditional love that only God can give. ❤✝️🙏🏼😍🤩🤍
plzz say I'm not the only  just standing in awe n speechless. It all ends with us💞💞❤❤
just wow....
lyrics : The church doors are closed To those who need most The love that's inside, mm-mm In the black tides they fight 'Bout who's wrong or right While the innocent die, mm-mm An eye for an eye leaves Everyone blind with You can't seem to see the way Ooh  'Cause everyone's hurtin' Tell me, when will we learn it? And what more can I say  What if we just Love Love Love? What if we just Love Love Am I askin' too much? Ooh  Too many have lost their lives and Too many tears we've cried 'cause We couldn't seem to see the light But what if we just Love Love Love?  Now you're all by yourself And you're cryin' for help But they don't hear a sound And your walls know too well You've been livin' in hell Tell me what to do now, ooh  But don't you get tired When you run for your life You don't need to this time  What if we just Love Love Love? What if we just Love Love Love? Ooh  Too many have lost their lives and Too many tears we've cried 'cause We couldn't seem to see the light  But what if we just Love Love Love? What if we just Love Love Love?  But what if we just Love? We just love
DAMN that was BEAUTIFUL!!!  Praise God for making the voice and heart of this angel! (Joshua Bassett)!! THE WORLD NEEDS THIS SONG, and we NEED YOU!!!  I needed this, thank you!! PREACH "the doors of the church shutting to those who need love most" I feel that in my life bro.  I Pray, Please Jesus let the light and truth in the message of this song spread and heal our broken world.  SENDING LOVE YOUR WAY BRO
I wish everyone could see this masterpiece! This song/video is so beautiful and special ❤ congratulations for this incredible job, Josh!
Here’s My Story  Josh I Had The Biggest Breakdown After Listening To This Song  I Am A Proud Lesbian But With That Comes The Disapproval From My Parents. They Don’t Know Yet & Everyday I Am Terrified About How Different My Life Will Be When I Eventually Tell Them  My Father Blames Himself…He Blames Himself Because I’m Not The Only One Who’s A Lesbian In My Family…My Sister Is Too. He Blamed Himself Because He Wasn’t In Her Life Too Much & That’s Why He Thinks She Ended Up Like That But…He Raised Me & Here I Am…A Lesbian  I Truly Hope I Can Come Back To This Comment With Some Good News But Considering How My Momma Told Me To Never In Her Life Come To Her & Say That I’m Gay…I Don’t Think I’ll Have The Happy Ending I Want  My Parents Are Hardcore Christians & It’s So Scary Knowing That I Won’t Be Loved By Them After I Tell Them. I Constantly Feel Like A Secret Disappointment To Them & All I Can Do Is Suffer In Silence. Literally Was Crying Not Far From My Dad But He Heard Nothing  I Just Want To Be Loved…I Wish It Was As Easy As You Made It Sound Here. I Haven’t Cried This Hard To One Of Your Songs Since “Set Me Free”.   I Thank You For Making This. I Love You
josh thank u soo much for making this song
oxe do nada
this is so beautiful. i am so glad joshua did this.
wow. the video, the singing, the message!  josh you're just keeping getting better and better!
Love the song! Huge Joshua Bassett fan, but I worry this song might get copyrighted by the Paper Kites. The chords of the chorus are identical to their song “Bloom”
JOSH. Thank you for making the world a better place. Thank you for your music. We love you and we’re grateful for you. ❤️
So beautiful!!!
so beautiful ❤
Dear Joshua, you made me cry and I cannot describe the emotions that I'm having right now like... God bless you and keep you, make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you. This song needs to be heard by the citizens of this world. Like always, you did it. I'm proud of you, keep going.
GOD BLESS JOSHUA BASSETT
No way, this guy just comes out of High School Musical and makes such a beautiful, heart-warming song...
Beautiful. God bless u
Omg I thought the start got me 😢BUT THE END SCENES OMG THAT WAS I THINK THE MOST BEAUTIFUL HEARTWARMING SONG IVE EVER HEARD!!! when I saw that u posted a new video, I can't explain how excited i was to hear this, but then I heard the start and immediately started bawling my eyes out. It was the video, but it was the song more. I am 14 and for so many years I've seen my parents (who broke up when i was 2) abused and fight each other, the fighting wasn't as bad as the yelling they didn't fully beat each other up but the got angry enough to his each other and punch each other anywhere but the face and they still do and I always blamed myself or it and when I was 7 or 8 I always used to think suicidal things and sometimes I still do but my friend keep me going and I think about her it'll affect other people's lives and stop thinking and listen to u. All your songs are calming even if they are party song, they are just so amazing. "Too many lost their lives and too many tears we've cried" This is so meaningful. I can't find the words to explain it but OMG! WOW! This is so beautiful and it's such an inspiration to people of all genders, ages, personalities, anything. Josh, u did such a great job. Keep writing and stay safe and remember that no matter what we will always love you❤
So true! Everybody has to be loved, deserve love and God loves everyone no matter what we do, no matter how far we are from him. His love never betrays. Thanks so much!❤
Thank you so much for this song, Joshua, this is EXACTLY what I've been hearing from God recently. We need to stop throwing out hate and judgment and lead with just love and good news because EVERYONE DESERVES LOVE!!! I believe with my whole mind that God will bring a great movement of love to heal so many hearts. <3
:(
FUCK OLIVA😍😍😍😉😉 jsut remeber that somone said that during the stadiom
I definitely cryd when saw this
Joshuaaaaa!! You’ve done it again. A lot of people really needed this, me included. I guess I just want to say thank you for all you do and have done 🫶🏽🤧 I can’t explain how much it’s helped me.

God is really speaking to and through Joshua. such a beautiful, convicting, inspiring, and encouraging music video and song. so proud of josh and so thankful for our loving father God.

joshua, you’re always such a light into this messy and crazy world and i hope you know that! sending lots of love for you and i hope you’re doing well 🤍 seeing that you released new song today truly brightened up my day and this one is really important. thank you for always spreading love and kindness no matter what  💌
this brought tears to my eyes. this is the message the world needs to hear! thank you josh for this beautiful masterpiece. ♡︎♡︎
I love this🤍
A Beautiful music video! Just Love! Chas and I were grateful to have been a part of it.
meu deus......
We need love, guidance and good people, but no one needs church. It's all fictional and bs. The whole message of the song pissed me off. It's great if it brings you inner peace, but you can't imply that everything bad happens to people comes out of not being a religious person or have "lost the light". As an ex-religious person who has attempted suicide before, the light for me was realizing only rationality can give you the relief you're seeking. I'm still struggling with childhood trauma and mental health, but it doesn't fucking mean that i have lost the light. We need science and therapy, not fairy tales.
I am so sad he still supported gay😢
God, I ended up this video with tears on my face. The lyrics and the video just left me speechless. Joshua never disappoints❤ lov u so much i have been seeing you growing through the years, your heart is so kind and your soul is so talented. @JoshuaBassett When we find Jesus it's beautiful but knowing that someone else finds him and believes in him it's amazing. We all need love, but Jesus love is enough.  So we should share that love with others.
I’ve always been the biggest fan of Joshua .. he’s helped me thru more than he knows. I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 11 and several attempts but ever since his music came out I’ve been coping with it away better. Thank u Joshua for everything you do and your a fighter too🩷🫶🏼
❤❤❤❤
♡
Thanks for sharing this beautiful and necessary message! Love the video, love the song, thank you! 😍
joshua this is why i love you
I’m in love with Joshua’s music ❤ despite all the hate he gets from people he continues to spread kindness and love to everyone and the messages in his lyrics are so meaningful. Thank you Josh for blessing us with yet another beautiful masterpiece.
Amen 🙏🏼🩵🙏🏼
this was so beautiful joshua! it touched my heart! thank u for this and for shining a light on Gods love for each of us ❤❤
So powerful. It really is in our hands. It ends with us.
Goosebumps the whole way thru this video, thank you Josh, this is such a beautiful way to spread such an important message.❤
Amazing as always x
I can't stop crying, this is beautiful. 🥺 I am very moved. This is exactly how people and world should have been. Great work as always ❤️💖
I listened to this 5 times in one hour Josh , my eyes was fr watering , I’m not  kidding . I’ve waited almost a year and it was worth it . Thank you so much for being such an amazing inspiration in music and in life🙌🏿🌟✍🏾
and a fraction of child abuse gets reported (been there lol) most kids will not report it, really it only gets reported and listened to if an adult speaks up.
This is exactly what churches need to be like, great job on capturing something that should be a normal thing :)
Joshua, the Church doors are always open for every single person: from the greatest saint to the worst sinner. God calls you by name.  Might ask us to let go of bad habits and things that don't do us any good, that are hard to understand - that's a form of love too.
I lost someone about 2 weeks ago now, that I looked at as my brother (was there when I was born, spent every holiday together, our moms are best friends) to su!c!de. This is the second time in my life someone extremely close to me has been lost to this. So I was touched in unique way to this song. I can not lie I was scared when Joshua expressed his religious beliefs, as my bf has experienced abu$3 at the hands of a couple people in the church. And seeing how deeply that has effected him, I have been very irrationally scared to listen to any media involving the church. And I guess it took until now for my brain to be rational and understand, just because one person is a awful person does not make a whole vast group of people bad. Basically I'm just really love this song and Joshua. Anyone who read this far, I love you and I hope maybe my vulnerability helped you in anyway to any degree. And if you are struggling with your mental health, please talk to someone (I'm here to talk also!) and most importantly, talk to a professional, I understand it is expensive, but a psychiatrist fee is better than a funeral fee.
bro I'm crying
No inventes Josh Me encanta tu música y ahora esto pfff! Amo el mensaje que dejas.
Could not love you more. Such a great message<3
The chorus sounds a lot like this song. https://youtu.be/bwrJWV3MVMU?si=K-mbBBNKAHZe_QPb
❤❤
Holy Shit did not expect to be sobbing in the middle of my office today. This was phenomenal. I have always been a huge fan of his as an artist but I'm growing to also be a fan of him as a human. God Bless.
Just love. This song touched my heart , this world just needs love.🤍
Awwww pls my heart.
I am gay
I can't stop cry even night
I'm in love with my girlfriend and my parents don't suppose me
I love the concept of letting everyone in the doors of our churches. God is love, and we should portray that love to anyone and everyone.  The church is not just for people who are “perfect”, but for the sick, lost, lonely, & hurting. It’s okay if our churches don’t look like a perfect picture. But God is also truth. And God is also righteous judgement. We have to be careful not to reduce the gospel to simply love and that is all. Jesus loved, AND called people out on their sin, AND forgave those who repented. He both loved and shared His truth. We must do the same. Love even those who are sinning. Let them in the doors of your church. And preach the gospel of truth to your church so that the lost might be saved.  If the Bible says it’s right, share it. If the Bible says it’s wrong, share it. Love does not equal withholding the truth or accepting of sin. We do not have to approve of their sin in order to love them. But it is equally important to make sure we do not shun them because of their sin.   If we really love, we will spread truth IN love. If we withhold the truth, we will love those who live in sin straight to hell. And is that really love?   God loved us so much that He sent His son to die for our sins so that we didn’t have to sin anymore. Jesus loved so much that He spread the truth to anyone & everyone, no matter their sin & no matter their appearance. He did not accept their sin by loving them. He did not withhold the truth from them. THAT is love. ❤️
As somebody who thought multiple times of suicide myself. This song is very appreciated to both of my inner heart cores.
I haven't been more dissapointed with Youtube's algoritme and notification reminders than right now to miss it 17 hours before i found it myself is just absurd.
Just love, man. This is what real ministry looks like. Also, you killed it with the directing! You should be proud 🩵
Felt as if he’s singing from Jesus’s point of view. I loved it
I love what your doing!
Everytime i feel like everything is terrible and will never be better, listening to Josh's songs always reassures me that everything will be okay and pain doesn’t last forever
as a christian, this is what we are called to do. It hurts my heart that people in the church don’t embrace everyone like we are called to. this is so powerful thank you for showing gods love to people.
love you Joshua, I'm happy for you thank you very much for the desire to help more people with this great message your fans love you but Jesus loves you more and hugs
it ends with us, it ends with love. It’s up to us to do our part in this world and we choose love. thank you for your beautiful words 🫶🏼
I have been waiting for months for a new song and this is one of my favourite Joshua songs
Love the way he’s spreading Gods light to others. Such an example of someone who changes their life views because of Christ. 🤍 need more artists to turn to God too
Te amo joshu ❤❤por ti estoy aprendiendo inglés ❤
Got me in tears man. Everybody needs that love of Jesus ❤️
What a beautiful song Joshua!! It truly sets an example of how people deal with these issues and all they ever needed was love. God has given you so many talents and you are definitely using them to not only spread  the word but show you care and show God's light in your path. God loves you and so do we.
Pride🏳️‍🌈
this is just so beautiful ❤
Just Beautiful

"God sent His son into the world not to judge the world but to save the world through Him" John 3 :17
this is beautiful.
this is beautiful. Made me cry
Others: I’m going to crucify people  Joshua: I’m going to love people
God is so so so good, and it brings me to tears that Josh is finding Christ. God loves everyone and as Christian's we should not spread hate, but spread grace. To just love. I love this song and the meaning of this music video. It makes me so happy that Josh is using his platform for such important and amazing awareness of mental health and the Lord☺️
We needed this song The world needed this song
I'm weeping, thank you for such a beautiful song 💖🥺 May God continues to bless you and guide you to keep using the gift He gave you to share He's light and love with others ❤️
This is amazing, incredible... speechless.
I love this songgggggggg so much thanks josh ❤️ 🎶
❤️👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 I love this, this is amazing
This song is so wonderful you are such an amazing person❤
This is what we need ❤ You are an angel.
Breath-taking to see the spiritual message of that song. So different from what we are used to hear from the pop music. This song seems really personal, at least I can feel that this cause of child abuse and violence is dear to your heart Joshua. Thank you for this beautiful message, and for the hope your song conveys. We christians should all be witnesses of the light of Jesus in our own life, and I can feel the light in you. Thank you so much for sharing this with the world. God bless you and God bless everyone suffering from abuse, violence and may He bring help to each and everyone who's asking for it 🙏
❤
Josh this is so beautiful and thank you so much for using your platform to spread this message
The embrace at the bridge really brought me to tears
i'm crying so hard thank you joshua, i love you so much. thank you for saying yes to Jesus ❤
Stop this is such an incredible song and such an incredible music video. Thank you
this song is complete magic!
I’m currently balling. I will loved this song during my hard times.
What a beautiful song. It meant so much. Thank you Joshua Bassett
I love him so much❤❤
So beautifuland so true
Keep it up, I’m so happy to hear you’ve been captivated by Christ!! GOD BLESS YOU Joshua❤️😍
This is a beautiful display of Mark 2:16-17! Church is for the broken and the hurt! Healthy people don’t need a doctor, only sick people do. Sinners need church, and that is each and every human who walks this earth! Thank you Josh for this beautiful song and video!!  Mark 2:16-17  16 But when the teachers of religious law who were Pharisees saw him eating with tax collectors and other sinners, they asked his disciples, “Why does he eat with such scum?”  17 When Jesus heard this, he told them, “Healthy people don’t need a doctor—sick people do. I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners.”
O poder da música. Emocionante
you have so much to say to the world, i love your life lessons <3
this is incredible. not only is it a call to all humankind to step up and make a difference but it’s also a message to the Church. the amount of people with religious trauma or who have a bad experience with religion is unacceptable. we need to show Jesus’s love, not push people away
joshua u gonna make me cry again
Joshua Taylor Bassett, I’m here for you and always will be ❤️❤️ I love you so much <33
I am not a Christian, not a fan of Christianity, however even without it anyone can relate to this song and it’s powerful message, this is what the world needs right now, it starts with this song, but a lot more can be done. But don’t limit it based on religion that is apart of the problem. No matter your religious, political, or sexual orientational beliefs, just be kind to people and communicate
Wow! Incredible! Somehow this song describes everything that happens to me! And seeing how you get people out of their hole just shows me that your music always heals me and stops me from doing certain things! I cried so much because of Just Love. I realized that I've never been so happy to know someone on social media! Josh keep it up, thank you from the bottom of my heart!❤ Your music means so much to me, stay tuned and thank you for healing me! Just Love❤❤❤
you got me out here crying yet AGAIN 😭 this video, the message, everything, just WOW. i lost one of my closest friends that id call family to suicide last october. still wishing there was more i could’ve done to save her; so this hit me HARD. thank you for sharing your light with the world, honestly. i love you so much 🥺💜
I love my parents to infinity, Just Love. It's plain and simple.❤️
Just love. Love you Josh, thanks for this ❤
I really hope this video gets to so many people’s hearts. I broke down in tears watching this. My parents always fought and they still do and it’s terrible for a kid and watching my little brother try to ignore the pain. When I read the ending it broke my heart. This needs to get to every possible person.
Thank you !!!! You're the kindest person on earth ❤❤ I truly love you 🥰🥰
God is using you in such big ways and I’m so grateful people like you exist to show this world his love🥹❤️
I honestly love this song and the message that it has. I love how it adresses the fact that people shouldn’t be discriminated against, no matter their race, their sexuality, their family situation or their economic situation. There is great diversity in this music video. It’s so important that these things are addressed and I think that Joshua has done that in a really emotional way. I really love your music!!!!
Wow (if u know u know) but seriously that was amazing Josh I love all your music but this whole video and song is well WOW
It literally touches so many different issues in 4 minutes like thats insanely inspirational. Also started crying the second the gay couple weren't allowed in church. Been there so it feels good to be accepted in at last ❤️
What a blessing❤
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 este video es una obra de arte, no paro de llorar 😭😭😭
Joshua, idk if you read your comments, but I have been following your story and praying for you to find Jesus for the past two years. Seeing your baptism and listening to this music video both brought tears to my eyes. God is so faithful. As someone who used to struggle with suicide (and who is only alive by the grace of God), I'm really thankful you are writing and singing about this. I am praying for you to continue growing in your faith, and I am praying for all the people that are fighting this.  everyone else: If you are someone who's been drowning for years, and you don't see any way out- there is real hope out there. regardless of what you feel. It's okay for it to be incredibly hard. I was "in the pit of despair" for several years of my life, but God is leading me through a place of healing right now. Since deciding I would stay alive (regardless of what I wanted) I have met my best friends and had the most incredible experiences of my life.  Don't give up on yourself and what God is doing in you and through you. There are people out there who need you. I am praying for you and love you very much. And Jesus loves you more<3
I'm Christian and to be honest what I've learned to do from people close to me and other Christians I trust is to love everyone. Yes, in the Bible it is a sin to do certain things, but that doesn't mean I should hate them. Anyone who wants to learn the word of God should be able to no matter what their orientation is. In the Bible it says we're all sinners and if we love other Christians despite their sins we should be able to pray for and love everyone else. Spread love, faith, and joy instead of hating someone for being gay, straight, lesbian, or anything in between. I love God and God loves everyone which is something a lot of people don't understand and to be honest a lot of Christians have lost their way and take everything way too literally. Sure the Bible says some stuff about some things but what is consistent throughout all of it is love.
the sad part is that people who do close the church doors to lgbtq community don’t realize that God loves all people..
this video made my heart so happy. literally just started crying at work. you’re music is going to save so many lives💛
I dont care if Joshua's not in the mainstream or if he'll ever be but all i know is there is a kid in India who listens to his songs all alone and feels everything, he makes us feel and loves him very much and i don't want him to stop.
damn
this is a masterpiece. I cried so much and had goosebumps from the very first second until the last one. So proud of you Josh
love this 😭💗
I am not a theist, but this is song is so very beautiful,  the video also perfectly complements the song!!! The only sad part is even though he said stuglff so clearly people still won't understand ik
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🫶🏻
Gay themed song but gays are way more mean to other gay people too. Ironically, straight were a little nicer to me as a gay person. Not really sure about this song but it still sounds nice and the piano sounds amazing.
After watching this video I felt something. I don’t know what put it was something! Such a moving video with the imagery(especially in the beginning with the beating of the parents, I never expected that and Josh and what I interpret his three younger versions saving them and walking into the church and out of the church and everyone coming together into the church) and the music and lyrics. Some of Josh’s song I can only listen to once or twice because the subject matter is so important, for me it’s sacred! As always some of his sims touch on very heavy topics and he leaves a lasting impression with his music!!! This video reminds me off all the videos were artists come together to tell their viewers to “love” someone on twitter said the song Imagine and I totally agree with that comparison. Whether or not it was an interpretation of his life or not it was such a great video. Good job Josh! 🥹👏🏾👏🏾
I’m so happy about this song, but must I say that Love is SO IMPORTANT! But Loving like Jesus is how to do it. Loving people’s isn’t telling them they can do whatever they want, but rather telling them to do what is right. But helping and leading people in the way they should go with compassion and love. Rather then being hateful. I understand exactly where he’s coming from. But promoting sin is wrong for everyone and hurts a lot in the end. So remember to lead people towards Christ the Right way and in Love! Helping them to turn their lives around for Christ!❤
Is that JAKE CLARK ??! 😂😂
joshua's "oh" is what we die for
❤
This made me cry so badly 😭😭 Joshua never disappoints when it comes to music  Everyone needs to spread this video and let's make it happen  You heard Joshua so let's do it ladies and gentlemen  Let's help out everyone thats around you suffering from abuse, or anything else  Let's spread love!! 🥺🥺 🫶🏻
I cried watching this video. It was so beautiful 🩷🩷🩷🥹😭🥲😊
OMG this is beautiful, not me an almost 30 year old moved close to tears by this message of love.
angel core
Soo good 😭❤️
That's beautiful!!! Thank you for spreading love to those who can't see the light this helps point them in the right direction!!! God bless you and yours!!!
When you wrote this song in a church of god did you think about your lgbtq life because god made you to like girls not boy and girls 🤔
nice storytelling Josh! your voice makes it even better. keep it up.
❤❤❤
Gorgeous voice
:(
🫶🏻

This is a beautiful masterpiece. I cried. Like actually CRIED. You can tell the the Lord has moved in Joshua’s heart. I’m so overjoyed that he is sharing the love of Jesus with the world. I have been praying for this for a while. Praise God!❤️

meu Deus joshua tô chorando te amo
I’m so happy that I have seen a celebrity grow closer and closer to Jesus. You don’t see it very often but I’m so thankful that you are spreading the word to LOVE and be like CHRIST.  Your doing amazing things ❤
I knew this would make me cry so I waited to watch it and I did indeed cry.

i love him so much.
i love this song the emotions in it 💗
This is just beautiful Joshua...thank you
This is an amazing song. I'm really glad he's back doing music
We're all in the same game just different levels dealing with the same hell just different devils
❤❤
What The Bible says about Love https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%2013%3A4-8&version=NIV
Joshua, obrigada por você ter me salvo, você segurou na minha mão também, suas músicas me fazem bem, acalmam meu coração, me fazem sorrir. Você é uma pessoa iluminada, eu amo você ♥ fico tão grata que você esteja vivo, todos os dias agradeço pela sua existência. Muito amor do Brasil 💖
Thank you for mentioning depression and suicide, it's something real that's happening. My dad passed away for this situation and It’s hard. Thank you for spreading kindness. Lot of love for you Joshua . Greetings from Perú 🇵🇪
Excellent.
This song and video are so good. Thank you for spreading such an important message. ❤
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Sobbed my eyes out. I no longer consider myself a Christian, though I did for many years. It’s hard to be a queer person in the spaces churches create, but love is the only answer to the divide. This depiction was beautiful, keep at it ❤ tears on tears on tearrrssss king
Yes, I’m crying 🥹🥹🥹 Such a beautiful song and video, congrats Josh!! 🤍
Joshua Bassett this music video was amazing such a cool way of spreading love  around to your community and making everyone feel at home and happy . Just such a beautiful way of showing your love to people and they deserve to know that they aren’t alone ❤️🥹🙏
I loved this so much! Thank you for reminding the world all we need is love!
This song is beautiful. Hit way too close to home. Thank you for this ❤
Josh's songs deserve so much more listeners and radio appearances
this song is so powerful thank you so much❤
Masterpiece!!!
gay people do not belong in the House of God homosexuality is an abomination and should not have been included in this. I like and support your message Joshua but bringing sin into the Church - The Body of the Messiah is wrong on so many levels and I hope and am going to place my faith in God, That He opens up your eyes and sets your heart and mind on him anew and afresh. And lastly, simply and clearly no do not just love everyone who is sinning by " accepting" them " the way that they just are ". Love them by praying for them, doing good to them and blessing them who curse you. You are not showing God's true merciful and gracious love when you allow for their sins to run rampant and unchecked at God's Door by THE WORD.  I love you Josh have a blessed Day ❤❤❤
This has so many hits I'm already proud
Beautiful message of love it touched my heart and soul Jesus is about love!!!!!! Stop the hate!!!!! We are loosing too many souls
dont think i can put into words how much il love this and the message
this was an amazing song sung by an amazing artist. i loved it
listening to the song and watching the music video both hit so hard, but in separate ways
Joshua, never stop doing what God told you to do! I am sure that if you continue to do this a lot of souls will turn to Jesus! Please make more music indicating the way to the life! A lot of people need to hear the good news ❤
Hey Joshua…..your are the only singer that I like! I mean the only singer that made more then 2 songs that I like! I’m really really crazy of your voice…..I listen you all the day❤❤ but can you do a show in Italy!!!! Plsss❤❤❤❤❤ I really like. You❤❤❤❤you are the best! And I live in Italy!!!!!! So can you!!!!!
thank you for spreading light love and kindness it's very important especially nowadays
josh..

this video is absolutely amazing
Thank you for this! You are the best!!!
im so proud
SCREAMING CRYING THROWING UP 😭😭😭
this is amazing i’m sobbing
josh you broke me 😭😭 I hope that everyone who needs help finds it ❤
Omg such an emotional song and audiovisual masterpiece! I loved your perfomance in the video
yow the heart of this man ❤
Very cheerful video. Loved the message on this song and video. It gives a message of hope, inclusion and salvation. You nailed it Josh. You did such a great job. Loved when the music spread these kind of messages. Specially at the end. It's sad but true. We are the change of the world. Hope it comes the day when people spread the love to the world instead of hate. Also it's so sas the first part od the video when the priest denied the entrance to the church to the gay couple. Is something hurtful when just for your sexual orientation, you suffer a lot of discrimination and sad that the churches spread the toxic message that being gay is a sin, that's what I hate about the church. 😢😭
Wow! Truely inspiring. Thank you Josh for all the love you spread.❤❤❤ It does truly end with love. One of my favorite quotes for one of my favorite artists is, "if you want to make the world a better place, take a look at yourself and make a change!" Amazing and beautiful song!!!❤❤❤
I needed this today...it's been hectic and stressful already this morning, thank you josh! 💖
POWERFUL all i can say
Yes my boy!!! I'm in tears😭. IT ENDS WITH LOVE.❤️
Thank u josh I’ve been going through some hard things at school I will always remember this video❤
❤
such an amazing song, i loved it🩷
This message is what the Church and the world need. Brought tears to my eyes and renewed the prayer of my heart to love because there are so many hurting people in this world. Thank you for this!! 🙏🏽💕
i'm crying
oh, this is beautiful!
Honestly the best song you've released so far! 💙💙
What if we just love?
The way he portrayed the scene, lyrics and the meaning behind is so insane
A freacking masterpiece
Gosh this is so beautiful. So proud of you 🫶🏼
you are incredible. there is no greater love than the love we get from God
I'm so proud of you. Love you to the moon and back. You are my favorite human in the world thank you for doing everything that you do you have saved my life. And that's the most amazing thing a hunas has ever given me. Life. "You bring me back to life" is what I can say to you. I love you.
Lovee
Joshua, you truly are making this world better in the perfect way. Love this and love you!❤
I needed this more than a breakup song. So thank you Josh. ❤ love from Portugal
The song was great, just not into the Jesus era
this is beautiful
such an amazing song by such a talented person.
This made me cry so hard. Wow.
OMG THIS IS A MASTERPIECE
Crying at 9am was not the plan but here we are 😭😭
CHILLS. THIS WAS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL JOSHUA. Love you!!! Just love!!! 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
this song is so emotionally moving it brings me to tears everytime i listen . thank you for sharing this masterpiece with the world.this music video is true one that touched my life. thank you Joshua.
i think this teaches us that NOT ALL CATHOLIC PEOPLE ARE BAD!!! i was raised in catholic world, and there are people who are more closed but then there are progresive catholic people who truly want to help. thank you so much
AMEIIIII
Aw, Josh. Thank you. That is something so big to sing about. You are so brave for doing that. I hope your words inspire that change that needs to happen ❤️
❤❤❤
Can we get something straight? The church does not reject homosexuals, sin is what is rejected. Sin such as stealing, killing, lust, gluttony, etc. We do have homosexuals in church’s and we do not reject them like how the video shows.
Te amo Josh, eres un gran artista, verdaderamente talentoso e iluminado. Pero sobre todo, se nota el increíble ser humano que eres. Tus canciones siempre son un abrazo a los oídos y al corazón. Ojalá llegues muy muy lejos, estoy verdaderamente orgullosa de ti ❤
Thank you Joshua ☺️
🌻🎈
Josh in his Jesus era is healing me, thank you Joshua Bassett. God's love isn't just for a selective few people it's for everyone... Thank you for sharing this and being so open with us.. being valuable is hard.. especially when you are a christian
Joshua I have a question for you if Olivia would give you a chance to date you again would you take the offer?
i shed so many tears while watching this... you deserve the world. thank you joshua
God bless your heart joshy
❤❤omgg
I love how each song that this man releases is a storyline that you can easily relate to. God bless his ability to write and show souch beautiful stories. He knows that he can maje a change with his music and that  is exactly what he is doing. We love you. ❤❤❤❤
joshua i’m so incredibly proud of you. thank you.
no pensé que lloraría con esta canción, pero en el momento en que Joshua va a darles la mano a cada uno de los que estaban pasando por un mal momento, la canción llegó a mi corazón
The most beautiful thing you’ve released ❤️we love u josh
This is incredible josh!
By far one of the best songs he’s written and best video directed. This is truly a beautiful work of art. From the bottom of my heart thank you Joshua. If anyone reads this, remember you’re never alone God is with you, blessings!🫶🏻
🖤
Josh you are truly an amazing human, you always spread positivity, love and just everything. This is one of the best songs ever. I love you  GUYS JOSH DID IT AGAIN
Hi, Josh u made a such good job on this! I loved it ! And the mensage behind this is wonderful!  thank u a lot ♥️
Just emotion song wow Sow Beautiful  💖🔥🫶🥰
caramba...
He’s looking like a snack as always.
Ok first let’s take a moment to just give joshua a BIG pat on the back josh has had sooooooooo many downs in his life and I’m so proud of him for making a song with out negativeness he’s going to try to make every thing in his life positive if possible. I think he is truly trying to send all of us and god a message he knows that this world is no longer a good world there is so much conflict in this world that we have no positivity to look back on but when I look back on this song, all I see is a message that everybody needs to hear there’s a lot of people out there who lose their lives in the worst ways possible we need to think back on how grateful we need to be because we have a lot of things that others do not have. If you think the same give my comment a like or even comment if you would like. And lastly, we can’t think of people on their past we need to think of people of how great their future can be, and how great of a person they can be,the past is always going to live in us, but we all need to forgive people we may not always forget, but we can always forgive. So let’s give Joshua a lot of love for this song that everyone should be so grateful for and I hope all of you can see what he’s been trying to say. ❤❤❤❤❤
What a beautiful song! I’ve got chills all over me ❤
didn’t think i’d be crying this morning 🥲 that was the most moving video i’ve seen in awhile
I am so impressed by Josh and his willing to spread love and what he believes in. We all know he’s going to get backlash because of this video, but he did it anyway because he believes in it. That’s some incredible courage, and that is pretty damn inspiring.
im crying
Lindoooooooo
I was adopted at 6 and this touched my heart 💖💖
Thank you joshua this song is what everyone here needed but not just here everywhere. You are changing the world.
❤❤❤❤ great song josh, you’re amazing
you are such a beautiful person josh, thank you for using your fame for good and always spreading love. i love so much
i love you i love you i love you
this made me cry. thank you so much
Josh, I'm very proud of you, for everything you've been through and managed to turn into art, you inspire me, I love you!
God bless you Josh😭❤️Hallelujah!!!
Omg Josh you are so so so underrated. You deserve to be a superstar!!!
Amen! 👏
To Joshua,  Thank you for this song and music video. This topic is very devistaeing to learn and talk about but i love how you made this situation into a very good song. I have been here along the journey and Started watching you grow as a human and a very kind and loving person. I remember the first time seeing you on T.V "Stuck In The Middle" as well as "HSMTMTS". I was here when you started producing your own music, no matter the amount of hate you got qhile still in the process you kept goind and kept your head held high. Thats why i love you and your music soooo badly, i have something to connect with and the have something to listen while i am down. No matter how bad you may fall the cuts and bruses never add up to the battle and the war. Love you and keep doing you! ❤️💕✝️
This is beautiful baby... Keep it Up. Honey, I know how this feels
Geez, so deep.
Problem is love involves telling the truth and the truth is not always pleasant 😢❤
Not asking for fame, not asking for recognition, just using his voice to try and make a change ❤ #takenotes
My love, this is so beautiful and important because sometimes all we need is love. The world has been so cruel these times and this corrode me every day, but we have to remember that life is love not pain!
Josh, i JUST LOVE you
Love u so much, Joshua ❤️ thanks for this ❤️‍🩹
I love how Josh is embracing his faith in the Lord Almighty even more now <3
You are so strong, your work is so perfect and beautiful. You deserve the world josh!! I'm glad you managed to meet Jesus in your own way, because he really is just love and no one can take that away from you.
Wow. Love really does always win in the end ❤ I’m so grateful for Jesus everyday for His love that has set me free. It sounds like He has set you free as well. Continue to love mercy and walk humbly my friend and brother in Christ ❤
this made me cry
Absolutely mind blowing. You’re beautiful.
Amen! this video made me cry tbh, he's speaking facts!! thanks for another amazing song, josh!
I think I needed this song. Thank U Josh <3
Thanks, Josh!! It’s amazing to see how God is working in your life. Thanks for spreading the message that since there are broken people in this world as a Christians we need to show love to others no matter their situations or circumstances and invite them into the church.
That gave me chills, the ending made me cry... Thank you for spreading this message. ❤
Josh, this is so beautiful!
joshua is literally the sweetest human on earth
Literally bawling my eyes out at this amazing song and music video. Leading by love and kindness is exactly what we are all called to do on this earth. ❤❤❤
I’m not religious and I like to stand my ground on that because I go to a catholic school and I fell like religion is forced upon me too much by my school so generally I would not choose to watch something like this but I truly think you are spreading a very important message that should be shared to more people and you are doing just that, in a great way. ‘Just Love’ is exactly what more people need to do we need more people like you  ❤
Amazing!
i’m on the floor sobbing
Josh got me crying in the train while on the way to work rn 😭
Thank you, Josh🤍
Dear, Josh This is amazing! This is what everyone needs these days. Thank you for your work.
yawn
as someone who’s been scared off of christianity because of situations like this and religious trauma i won’t get into, this video healed some of my inner child. thank you Josh for always just loving.
As someone with family problems and toxic relatives, this song speaks to me on a spiritual level because I want nothing more than to reconnect with my cousins after not seeing them for so long, but big egos and pride are getting in the way of that from happening. So, thank you Joshua, for writing yet another beautiful song that manages to tug at all of our heartstrings. God bless and stay safe, everyone. ❤❤❤❤
There is such a beautiful and powerful meaning that josh is describing and I feel like lots of people don’t understand sometimes
This felt like it should be an announcement for Joshua’s own church or something
Finally Joshua bringed us another of him amazing music
Wow this is beautiful
josh this is amazing omg
This song reminds me when Joshua were together with with Olivia Rodrigo 😢
Omw Joshua...this is so beautiful❤
i love the message that has been delivered in this song. such a powerful song.
this is made and produced so incredibly beautiful, i‘m literally in tears and so emotionally touched. you have such a big and beautiful heart josh, the way you speak up about those topics and talk about the raw feelings and thoughts so many people who are not only watching this but also in the world are going through is the biggest gift you could give to someone. making one feel so understood and seen, showing help, showing to choose just love because like you said: it ends with us, it ends with love. never stop doing what you’re doing because with people like you this world shines brighter. sending much love your way 🫶🏼
i’ve struggled so much with depression and suicide over the past few years. i’m a part of the queer community and i don’t feel accepted in church which is a big part of why i don’t know what i believe in. you have no idea how much i needed to see this, josh. thank you❤️
im literally sobbing omg Josh you are so amazing
This is your best song yet!
Dude, im drowning in tears. The song its so beautiful, the message is gorgeous, and its so well portrayed in the video. Thanks for spredding love Josh❤️

the song gives me chills....
Omg when he grabs the kid. Joshy I in fact just love you
this is so beautiful i am so astonished
I LOVE YOU JOSHUA BASSETT
Why would you make me cry
This is amazing. This man is incredible.  Josh, I can’t stress enough how important your existence is. You are a glimpse of light in this dark dark world. I’m honestly so sorry for everything that you’ve been through. Yet I’m so proud to see the way you turned everything around for your own good and now for others too.  Thank you for this song and for the stories you share. I love you.
Sobbing rolling on the floor lysm
What an amazing song and music video. God Bless you❤✝️
this made me cry so much, oh my god. I love Josh so much. Thank you for being the person you are
Wow joshua🥺❤️
Y’all so is he still queer or nah? Because I remember this he came out and then immediately begin to preach about god. It’s a little concerning…
Chilling message, this is beautiful, Josh. Thank you for this
WHAT A MASTERPIECE. CRYING SINCE THE FIRST SECOND 😭😭😭😭
I love how josh's peace turned out to be found through religion and God but this is directed to anyone regardless their beliefs and anyone can relate to this. He's doing everything HUMANLY possible to help victims of the real issues adressed in this video. I'm glad josh found something that made him see the light, which was faith in God, because no human did for him what he is doing for others right now. He tells people there's a "very real God" but also does every thing he can do as a human to help them. We're lucky that he made it out
This song is very amazing to me it brought emotions to my heart made me cry I don't care that I am a teenager they can cry to and No matter what anyone says I won't let anybody bother me even if they judge me for it I'll just do my best to ignore but also be so extremely very friendly like I always love to be to everyone. I wish we could all just love each other sadly that is not everyone in real life I really enjoyed the official music video it made me cry harder than the actual song without the video showing thank you for this masterpiece and love Joshua Bassett!!! ❤
I've lost a friend due to alot of mental health problems and hearing this song just broke me into tears. Thank you Joshua for showing everyone what is happening in the world we are living  in today! You're very talented and smart enough to do a video like this and show that everyone should be loved no matter who they are or what they are going through ❤
😢😢😢
beautiful josh
joshua,you did it again🥺
As if the song itself doesn’t have a powerful & emotional message already, the statistics at the end are absolutely heartbreaking. Such a beautiful and inspirational song Josh. Also excellent work on directing this music video. It’s so well done. You should be incredibly proud of yourself for putting out the kind of content that will touch hearts and minds across the world.
Wow. Wow. Wow.
This, this made me cry, Josh, thank you for this song, you’re one of the reasons why I’m still here so thank you😭❤️
Love this!
Idk man, it’s rare for me to think of someone as family after listening to a lot of there music, but you did that, u are my family, I love you josh, and I feel your pain
The only word in my mind rn is beautiful. Such a beautiful message in every way.
Everything about this song is so humane! Thank you, Joshua!❤
Increíble 🥹 SÚPER FAN DE TI y de tu música Joshua

This song is amazing!

What a beautiful song and music video with a beautiful message ❤
amazingggggg
I LOVE THIS❤
I always cry over your songs because they are so beauty full and special to me
Adding this to the infinite reasons why I love you
we hate the sin, not the sinner<3 so good
this man is underrated af
That is the most inspiring, beautiful and comforting song I have ever heard. I can already tell this song is gonna help people though some rough times. I love you Josh for this xx
Amazing!
i love this so much 🫶🏼
WOW  IM SPEECHLESS THIS IS BEAUTIFUL
beautiful song and message 🥹🤍👏🏼
what you did was beautiful josh. I’m so proud❤️
I haven't cried so much over a song, I don't think ever. Thank you Joshua for being there with your music.❤❤❤
Thar was heart and gut wrenching but needed. The message is clear but not everyone gets or follows it. It's does start with us and LOVE ❤Ty for this incredible video🙏🙏
❤❤❤
Thank you so much for this, Joshua! So many people try to hide behind religion, behind something to justify being judgemental or prejudiced towards the others, to devalue others feelings, pain, experience, when in reality the focus should be about "what if we just... Love?!". The world would be such a better place. Than you for the way you used your talent and your music to spread this message. 🤍
❤
This song is absolutely amazing. I love it. Everyone should live their lives to the fullest because you never know what people are going through behind closed doors. If someone wants to help you, let them. Even if you don't want the help, take it because this could be you and no one wants that. Stay safe everyone and do as Joshua said, 'Just Love'.
YOU ARE OUR HERO JOSH <3
Josh, we’re so proud of you ❤
I really needed this song. You know sometimes it's so hard to ask someone to pull you out when you are drowning. Just a bit of love from everyone is what you need
thank you for always spreading love, all the time, you're such a light in this dark world
That was the best music video I have ever seen! 😭
i love you so much
🥺🫶🏼!!! thank you josh 🫂
you are so cool
This song is absolutely beautiful, it is so good that you use your voice to talk about this topics. You are doing a great job Josh! 💜
Omg, this is what I ask myself every day, I really don’t understand all the hate that we have and the things that people do, when u can just love really. This is definitely the best song u ever wrote, I feel like this all the time, thanks josh. Sending Love from Italy ❤❤❤❤
It ends with us. It ends with love.
Watching his music and him grow these past two years has been so encouraging and amazing. I love the message he’s portraying through pop music. ❤
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. Believe in him and you will be saved and go to heaven!
Ay Joshua 🥺🥺
I can’t wait for this song I’m excited to finally see what this new song
Thank you for this heart-melting song : <<<< love you!
This is so much more than I expected this to be. This is beautiful, true, and heartbreaking. Josh, you have created something really beautiful. I really hope people will get the massage 🙏. Why can't we just love?

SUCH GOOD SONG AND MV🥺😭
Josh, I just wanna say how much I believe God's using you to minister to so many others. I've survived many numerous traumas that you've survived and I've been on my own mental health and trauma recovery journey, and your story -- and particularly your Zack Sang interview -- certainly resonated with me, and Set Me Free has been my own anthem of my life going forward. I love you Joshy! ❤

This brought me to tears. Thank you Joshua for using your platform and your voice to (literally) spread love. Your music will impact the lives of many who are feeling lost, whether it brings them to Jesus or just helps them feel less alone. You are a gift to the music industry. ❤
Wow, topics like these should be talked about openly without fear, it is very important to be aware of each of them as well as mental health, problems at home, etc. Thank you Josh for creating art and inspiration and above all letting us know that we all deserve love and that we are never alone 🖤 I love you.
love
Just Love...
sobbing

Proud of you Josh. Yes the love of Jesus can bring healing to everyone! ❤
Wow, so good.
I also want you to rescue me Joshua Bassett
This is truly amazing. God has called us as Christians to live, not judge. We can't expect others to want to know God if we are hateful. God is love, a lot of people have forgotten that
Another masterpiece 🫶🏼Thank you for this song and this important message 🙏🏼
i cried

Such a great song and message Josh. Thank you for speaking out.
Ta parecendo comercial da Universal. Me poupe.
By the end of the song, my entire body was filled with tingles, my hands went numb, and I was crying too hard. Joshua, what a beautiful song and what a wonderful video, you represented the love of Christ so wonderfully. I felt God showing me his love through the final scene, how Jesus has a hand to those who need it we just need to learn to see it. God bless you🤍🤍🤍🙏🏻🙏🏻
This is why I love Joshua Basset 🥹😍😭🤩
I’ve started to feel hopeless with the messages portrayed through music: the ones about hate, “jokingly” wanting to kill someone, etc. Thank you for bringing back hope to my life and the world
Joshua  you did a amazing  as a director
Thank you. You are the reason I still believe in the music industry
this is so beautiful, thank you so much for sharing
Love the way Jesus loves. This is amazing Joshua. You represented being the light that Jesus offers very well. His love and open hand is always their. There is never someone to far gone. We love because Jesus first loved us.
Very beautiful message ❤
This is seriously so good. As someone who has struggled with suicidal thoughts due to being ostracized for being autistic/disabled this song hit home. Thank you Joshua for all that you write and create into this world. Seriously such a gift from god you have been given!!!
God bless you always my love
te quiero muchoo Joshua
Wow. Amazing song. Powerful message. Amazing songwriting and directing Joshua!!
This is beautiful
Me atrevo a decir que es uno de sus mejores videos, agradecida de conocerte Josh ❤
Not just the song, but the music video was so beautiful. It made me so emotional once he picked up the little kid and began helping everyone, such an important message portrayed in a beautiful video 🤍🤍🤍
I’m in tears 😭❤️ Such a powerful and important song and video! The part where you grab the young boy and saved him, really got to me. I grew up with my parents fighting and I wish I was saved like that boy. ❤️ So powerful and so very very beautiful! Great job ❤
Josh is so special ❤
That was just beautiful and what a wonderful message!
Josh thank you for bringing it all to light. Not even two hours ago I didn’t want to be here and I was strong enough to talk to someone about it. I’m still struggling but I’m hoping to pull through. I have so much love for you and all the good you do. So thank you 💕
Amazing
What a beautiful piece and I love when there is an important topic to discuss hidden in the music video! This time it’s not hidden but clearly showed and it’s beautiful❤
joshua has done it again!
Joshuahhhhh!!!!!
so beautiful.
this is so beautiful i’m so proud

Just waiting til tiktok ruins this masterpiece with lip syncing and dancing
This message is the truth. This song is so beautifully written Joshua- and I can feel Gods love through you. You are an amazing blessing and may God continue to use you to spread His love and may all the glory go to Him. Incredible.
❤❤❤
Incroyable !!!
i love you Joshua
As someone who has struggled with “certain thoughts” for the past 8-9 years of my life, we need more of a message that tells people to get help and reach out, but also for others to be more aware and reach out to your loved ones who might not seem the same. Life is hard sometimes and we need each other. Life is a culmination of two or three big choices, and thousands upon thousands of little choices. Those little choices add up and much more often determine your character than the big choices do. Be a good person even when nobody notices. Do the right thing when there’s no physical reward for it. One small action can cost you nothing but reward someone else with lifelong benefits. We all need to be better and we all need to choose to do more.
😍😍😍😍😍😍
We need more positively in this world
This song made me cry
Just the best song ❤
We need more positively in this world
WOW amen
I’m very proud of u Josh❤️‍🩹
I cried like a baby I love this song

mr. joshua bassett. you have created an absolute masterpiece. this song is just a work of art, and the time and thought you put into it is beautiful. ❤️
im here on 22 September 2023...remember me
When he said "The church doors are closed to those who need most" I felt every bit of it in my veins.  This song is such a metaphor with such great lyrics. 🔥 ❤
Joshua!! This is seriously beautiful and just so touching. So proud of you! Thank you for sharing this and bearing your heart❤️
You heart is so beautiful Joshua, thank you for spreading this message. ❤
Josh that was great glad to have you back. I can't wait to see what you come up with next.
He’s right! We shall follow Jesus’ word and just love one another. Joshua you have come out with another tearjerker for us yet again. Thank you for inspiring us with your words and gripping our hearts! I aspire to provide the same music as you one day ❤
@MTV VMAS VIDEO FOR GOOD 2024???
The message that the world needs to hear and put into action. Let’s start by getting this viral so it reaches as many people as possible. Surprised Joshua isn’t talked about more
what a great message! love it!
Stop using lgbt community for cloud
😭😭😭😭😭
He loves making us cry
Hey Joshua I just got finished listening to the song and it really touched my heart if you ever read this can we be friends because I totally can relate
This is a beautiful message. As a progressive Christian, I love this. I’m proud of you Joshua and Jesus is too. ❤
Joshua this is the most beautiful song and music video you’ve ever done. 😭❤️
this is beautiful i love josh 🤍
this made me cry thank you for making this song🫶🫶🫶🫶
Joshua. I don't know what to say. Goosebumps all over. I have been following your musical journey from the start and since then loved every second of watching you grow as an artist and as a human being. Your development is amazing and even though we don't know each other personally it makes me so proud to be a fan of you. I hold nothing but the biggest respect and love for you. I wish more artists would be like you, especially artists around my age. Your way with words and music. The way you've been through so much, yet you always choose love and always choose to speak up against injustice. You know who you are and the morals you believe in and are true to yourself through all of it, even if people spread lies about you, even if people choose to blindly hate without any reason. The way you just want to spread understanding, acceptance and love in the world. I've never seen an artist who uses their fame in the best way possible. To raise awareness for the topics that really matters and in such a beautiful artistic way. This video, this message is a masterpiece. I am proud to be your fan. I already saw you live once but I hope I get to talk to you someday because you are someone who actually has something to say to the world. I truly wish you nothing but happiness and all the best.
I’m proud of you joshua 🫶🏻
i fully got the chills watching this. thank you for using your platform to spread awareness and the love of god.
The ending 😢
I'm seventeen and have struggled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts for years.  I recently found God, but it was so hard because of the ways so many churches do things. This music video summed up my life, and I am not ashamed to say that I sobbed my eyes out.  This song will most definitely be played over and over, and help to comfort and save so many people.  I love you, we love you, and God loves you, Josh.  I just wanted to say thank you. 💗
Wow🥲🫶🏼 an amazing song AND message thank you!!!
this is so powerful
I cried so much during this, what a beautiful representation of love 💕
i'm speechless. joshua... exactly. just love. this is perfection. God bless.
that is the most beautiful thing i’ve ever seen i’m so proud of you!!❤️
Love is the core fabric of being
You did it again
A bit too depressing and triggering for me unfortunately. It's not a song I'll be listening to again. And I am very worried about your new religous awakening and your move away from accepting your sexuality. I just hope you're ok.
I absolutely LOVE this❤
OH MY GOSH 😭😭❤️
I’m so beyond proud of you, beautiful cinematography 🤍
I am proud to call myself your fan, u and ur music and ur heart are so beautiful ❤️
Joshua Bassett's Evolution. Love fixes everything 💗💗, so what if we just love

I love how much bolder Joshua is with his faith!
Josh, thank you for everything you do. You don’t know how much you have help me ❤ I’m so happy you are using your platform for good and you deserve all the love and appreciation in the world ❤

It's too much for me you know? There are so many things that I want to say and maybe tell the world someday...but for now I'd just stop, breath and listen to this song until I feel ready. Thanks for this masterpiece Joshua. Can't believe I've been crying since I saw the trigger warning
Joshua… please don’t stop loving! As I try to be like Jesus each day, I also want to be more like you too! It’s pretty clear you got our backs❤️!  I beg that you’ll go so far out in life and we are all right behind you!
I don’t usually comment but I just want to say this, you’re doing great, keep the love going :)

What a beautiful song!
“Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.” ‭‭1 Peter‬ ‭4‬:‭8‬-‭10‬
❤❤❤

If all Christians were like you, I would still go to church. I love you so much. Thank you Joshua ❤
The emotion Josh fits in his songs is always amazing and truly makes me cry. Yet another amazing message to take in. Thank you so much for this Josh!
love this song so much! couldn’t believe my eyes when i saw jake clark in it
the visuals, the storytelling, the lyrics everything is so amazing. what a powerful music video well done josh !
This lowkey gave me chills
i'm bawling my eyes out. my school just lost someone to suicide this week and i didn't personally know him but it's hitting me a lot and this song came out at the perfect time. i have struggled with suicidal thoughts for most of my life and this was so powerful. your mental health matters.
This is incredible, thank you for making this song
I love it!!!!!!!!!!!
Another banger, thank you so much for this Joshua. Huge fan of your music and I love your HSMTMTS songs. I appreciate the emphasis you are placing on love because we for sure need more of it.
I love this. So good. The church needs to step outside the four walls. A church is a hospital. A hospital is for the sick.
the music video spoke to me so thank you for always making me feel heard, loved, and seen🌻💚
As músicas do Josh sempre me pegam de uma forma inexplicável. É uma conexão que tenho pouquíssimos artistas. Por favor, nunca pare de cantar Josh!
josh, i have taken a few minutes to gather my thoughts before commenting and i want to say thank you. as someone who struggles daily with not wanting to be here this video struck a cord with me. this song is so special to me and  i am so thankful you wrote such a beautiful song. seriously thank you so much. because of you i feel less alone. i love you always, joshua taylor.
Beautiful song❤
Joshua... the kind heart and soul you possess are absolutely beautiful. You deserve the same amount of love that you put into your work. Never lose the beauty and love you carry.

DIRECTOR JOSHUA BASSETT 🥺👏👏👏
Such a beautiful song <3
Llore con tan tremenda interpretación ❤️‍🩹
I'm speechless right now... First of all the song and the music video are beyond beautiful I'm still crying...  Second of all I don't have a really strong connection to my religion I didn't grow up that way but I'm extremely proud and so happy for you that you found that and also in general!!! Honestly for me that person that saves me is YOU with your music and I'm so grateful for you - you are loved ❤❤❤❤
This is so beautiful, Josh! So proud of who you’re becoming🤍 Cried like a baby🥹
Joshua, you’ve done it again ❤️
This is what God calls us to do. Just love. No hate, judgement, or shame. Just Love. Beautiful visuals and message. So well done.
que lindo el mensaje joshua <3
this is so beautifully made & hits so deep omg
Amazing song❤️ I’m so proud of you Josh❤️❤️❤️❤️
joshua never fails to amaze me, this song is beautiful🤍
man, i love josh
It's sad that you need to tell us in the first seconds that it's not about your parents, because these stupid children from tik tok will start looking for fictional reasons and people that your songs are about, which will result in bullying other artists, because they want to feel relevant and like they are your friends. Find your own life, children!
Josh just released another amazing and meaningful song
Joshua, you are so right in this video. as Christians we have to show love no matter what. That’s how we get people to follow Jesus. Just LOVE!
Thank you for being brave enough to show your love of God! I get so caught up in my own life that I forget that this isn’t the big picture, the #1 priority is to love others and let Gods love shine through us, so when they look at us they see Him. Keep showing His love❤️
I say this about all of your songs but that song was just beautiful and so well written  i am crying literally crying Joshua Bassett i love you so much ❤️❤️🫂🎉
Thank you for doing this Joshua, you're saving lives ❤
Mom told me today that justice doesn't exist and I was so broken by it because it's seems pretty real. somehow this video gave me hope, and I hope people starts to care how you doing rn josh, thanks for this!
JOSH... THIS IS MASTERPIECE
Esta canción se siente tan personal..... que lloro
The silence at the end hits hard, I’ve recently lost friends to suicide and it’s been really hard. But, this video is truly amazing and I don’t know what else to say except thank you Joshua Bassett for another amazing song.
beautiful Josh, this was absolutely beautiful❤️
I am currently rewatching to cry more
♾️/10 song
I’m so proud of Joshua. The world needs more people like him in it❤️‍🩹
Joshua, you are so right in this video. As Christians we have to love everyone and except everyone. So we can show them the love of Jesus.
In tears, Josh this is a masterpiece, I can’t believe that there are still humans like you that care so much about others. When the others can’t seem to find their light, you’re the spark. Keep on releasing music like this . Jesus loves you ❤️
Te amo, Josh ❤️‍🩹
I cannot believe this is real. You absolutely killed it. Millions of people need to hear this for so many different reasons. Thank you!😭
I’m crying so much. Beautiful message and beautiful video. Amazing job Josh

I love you josh
AHHH SO EXCITED. But I’m from England so will have to wait until tomorrow. it comes out at 5 am 😢
first off BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL SONG. I noticed something. The way Josh picks his younger self up off the ground, saves the boy from taking his life, and reaches out his hand to the struggling with addictions. JUST LIKE JESUS. I think Josh was representing JESUS’ LOVE. Jesus loves. I am sobbing at how powerful this video was. JESUS LOVES YOU SO MUCH. amazing song Josh🤍JESUS IS SO PROUD OF YOU!!  keep shining Him!
