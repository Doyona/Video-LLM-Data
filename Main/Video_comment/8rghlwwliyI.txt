skilla too good on dis beat
First of all. This song is dope. But this make me ponder how fucked up that life really is. We need to guide all our youth to not make the same mistakes that we made and no matter how deep they are in that life we need to keep trying to help them realise that the consequences of that life outweigh the rewards.

Don't put your trust in men, put your trust in God. Jesus is coming soon and it's time to repent. We are all sinners in need of a Savior. No one is perfect. We cannot earn salvation. It is a free gift from God. Mary doesn't save you, confessing to a priest doesn't save you, religion doesn't save you, self-help doesn't save you, meditating doesn't save you, Buddha doesn't save you. Only faith in Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection saves you. The Father gave His only begotten Son to die for our sins, and whoever believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life. Cry out to Him now. He loves you so much, but He won't force Himself on you. True love allows freedom to choose. If you don't want Him, He'll give you what you want - eternity without Him in hell. If you genuinely admit you're a sinner and need His sacrifice to pay for your sins, He will cover your debt and give you life forever with Him in heaven. I hope and pray you choose life!  This is realer than you could ever imagine.
Shoulda got All star jr on dis hoe
Buck shot his part in downtown Oakland. #TownShit #O2daD 💪🏿💯💯💯

Skilla still got the hardest verse 💯
Everybody turned up on this one.
10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners!  1. It's lonely at the top; but you do eat better.   2. No matter where you go, you're there. 3. Always remember that you are unique; just like everyone else.  4. Honk if you like peace and quiet. 5. Laugh alone and the world thinks you're an idiot.   6. We are all part of the ultimate statistic -- ten out of ten die. 7. I wonder how much deeper the ocean would be without sponges.  8. I intend to live forever. So far so good. 9. I can handle pain until it hurts. 10. What's another word for "thesaurus"?    Hi! Maybe the world's most thought-provoking one-liner is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com
This that eastside ain't it!!!
Sada baby ruined it
Ignorant bullsh1t.    Youtube algorithm is all screwed up.

Foolishness! When are these idiots going to stop acting like little children. Not one lick of talent and yet there they are, getting paid for nothing. Sold thier soul for sure. Whenever we see these no talents get rich, we know they gave something in exchange for all that money and fame.
The girl In the beginning has slender men arms
I would like to take this opportunity to pause and thank the American African community for their fine citizenship and culture second to none  They are not, as popular belief would say, cradle to grave professional full time victims at every turn on every occasion yet zero personal responsibility ever  They do not make hero’s of felons. The CDC statistics are racist that say OVER 80% are born directly into bastardization , or that they are responsible for 85% of violent crimes  Go on with your bad selfs 12.7%  Don’t worry, your culture isn’t SMASHED
Sada Baby 😱💪🏾💯
Buck snapped 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Best Version 🔥🔥🔥 https://youtu.be/61WxmmD6y4I

No
That’s wasup bro ! Rs if you know you know
I know some dont want to hear this but it needs to be said..For the rapper, drug dealer, prostitute, homosexual, partier, fornicator, drinker, drug user..Jesus is willing to accept you just the way you are.. Jesus died for all those and every sin and all a person has to do is believe he died or all your sins (past present and future) and you are justified in the eyes of God and will have a relationship with him forever
Fire 🔥🔥🔥

Is it possible for ANY black rapper to NOT USE the N -Word in their music???      I don't think it's possible.     In the first 2 seconds, some girl uses it...and in the first 10 seconds of the actual song, some guy uses it.
Just what the world needs... More wanna be t#&!*sh
