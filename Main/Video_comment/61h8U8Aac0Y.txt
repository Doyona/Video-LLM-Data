Those legs are like albino edamame bean pods.
The Robiniho not him actually had me crying
Hall of fame performance from Stephen Tries today
4:36 67 hehe
Anyone 2025
Fluminense FC
I can see my house in this video , it’s behind the beach volleyball court court . Do a drunk beach footvollyball
1:02 I am disappointed that was a rugby post not American football
16:57 😂😂
1:02 bro that mascot😂
Hey Chris. Come to Australia ya nonce
No one's going to talk about the guy rolling a spliff for them😂😂😂
Yo bro i have an idea for the Science fair
3 years ago wow
3:20 how he fell 🤣🤣🤣
16:33 for the year 3s 😂
Harry the hottie😍😍
6:40 has me dying 😂
Having a few beers with the lads playing football. What more could you ask for
Need a redo of this on a pitch with some actual grass
Love coming back to this for a laugh 😂😂😂😊
I'm a few years late but Stephen pulling out the Sigurdson jersey and yelling "For the year threes" might be my favorite thing he has ever said 🤣
9:51 This might be the funniest moment in the video
6:33 Just winging it
Now try it with Heroin.
😂😂😂. Need to make another video with Harry, Will and Stephan again 😂😂😂
Stephen was just so unhinged this video 😂
why did u say carpet when it is grass?
“Edge of the box is his game!”  “FOR THE YEAR 3’s!”
I love how the circle dna sponsor was removed
coming back to this i appreciate they got john drunk too, makes this video even better
Harry’s tagged as the sidemen and not w2s in the description😂
Honestly one of my favourite chris vids
11:08 11:21 11:35
2nd instalment coming but instead of 100 shots and 5 units of alcohol, we need 5 shots and 100 units of alcohol?
Ever imagine some guys on a football field drinking alcohol and throwing up😭💀🤣
but i thought stephen didnt drink
Not the green screen clips 😂😂
Top 3 Chris md videos of all time
Stephen: 5 Will: 9 (+ 4 pukes) Chris: 10 Harry: 7 Conner 1  Pretty sure I missed one
this has got to be one of the best videos of all time
16:27
This video still cracks me up 😂😂
Harry W2S Lewis he is funny person 😂🤣
why is stephen funnier in other peoples videos and not his own?
This group needs to get back together
he hits more goals when he's drunk than when he knows it's working😂
willne putting us geordie's to shame
Will: "I tHreWn Ya bAll!"
Well the "queen and country" line aged well
Does any of chris’ friends actually like him
Hoolahan 😂
16:20 to 17:30 was the funniest part ever
It's probably a rugby goal behind them but i thought for a second it was a GAA goal lol
These four are hilarious
My mates tried this and police told them to lose the alcohol 😂
Willne was on smoke this day
y'all are better drunk than sober at football 💀
i didn't even see the difference between y'all being sober or drunk 💀
whose the girl
Sigurdsson was actually proven innocent, classic case of trial via social media
I’ve never seen Harry laugh that hard💀 13:07
Everyone - enjoying the vid Me- getting the anxiety of getting the ball back whenever they miss 🥲
that last goal was the most beautiful thing i've ever seen in my life
9:00
300 bucks for a dna test gg
Connor is tekky
Is it just me or did they not drink much at all? It’s just not very scientific, that’s all.
DNA of a leprechaun, should be no problem drinking.😂
these drunk videos are just yall trying to find a best possible excuse to get drunk😂😂
This genuinely had me in tears, please do more drunk football challenges. "We can't be sexist we have to laugh" -Stephen Tries 2022.
Bf
This would def get you arrested in america
harry was heavy hear
Best  video out there
How many drinks was that by the end of it
Is no one going to talk about the Simon thirst trap
I died when Stephen said for the year three's😂😂😂
Nice roadman rap @StephenTries 😂
I come back monthly to watch this lol
Thanks to Circle DNA I know why Chrismd is so short👍
Why is this the funniest video I've ever seen. 😂
This is the video that started Chris’ obsession with drunk football
6:36 nice shot number
Best chrismd vid ever
Chris didn’t tell you the price of the dna kit and just saying sell a kidney if you want one
18:21
4:20
These lads make Chris look a normal height
Harry dying of laughter is the best thing 😂
Is harry playing rugby
That simon edit was funny
10:11 anyone knows that song name??
Sometimes they go in because John doesn't respect you enough to jump for it.
1:00 wtf is the cow doing 💀
What's the name of the song playing from 13:37 pls?
“I was raised on Faisal manji” underrated line
if stephen hasn't got all proceeds from this video - he been mugged
Watching this video after drinking makes it even funnier 😂
Watching this back again, still one of the funniest challenge videos to date!
