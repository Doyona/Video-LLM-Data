Almost fell asleep watching this
Deshae won that fight lol
Deshea got him one  2:38 😂😂😂
Back from the future... Who's here after ddg and Jay Cinco boxed?
9:27 deshae got smoked , cinco spared him and could have really went in for the kill 😆 he was done mobility and that punch took him out I’m sure he was dazed , confused and counting birds 😆
Can’t believe I just saw this
Bro don’t record no more L camera man
Great Job Cinco ❤
my dumbahh thought  the person that was announcing the names was fbg duck
Can I fight the camera man cs he making me mad
great advice after round 1
He did not win 😭
Weak ahhh camera man dodging punches too 😅
Good fight
Worst camera man ever
dashae won but it was close
3:17 upper cut was beautiful asf‼️😩
Deshae was winning till that third round. Realistically should’ve been called a draw
I think it was a draw!!! Great fight though
Back when Johnny tried 😂 his work face was working
Camera guy should be fired
Watching this in 2025 look how far everyone has come 🔥💪🏽from cinco to Ddg camera man they all lit
Camera man trash

Melt February 1st 💪🏽💪🏽💪🏽 what u gone do chino
When Cinco cooked deshae
GOT DAMN DESHAE GETTIN HIS LIL ASS TAGGED
2:38 dashae with that right hand bro 😮‍💨

8:38 everyone in that room felt that punch 🤣🤣🤣🤣

i’m sorry they both did REALLY good it was a damn good fight from both sides but i think Deshae one this one 😩
If you KNOW boxing Deshae FIGHTS wild he sometimes throw himself and just go wild if you are a strategic and calm person you would be able to X that out he throws hate makers that’s what get ppl but he actually can’t fight
Im like Cinco better fcking WIN ! All love but damn Cinco you been through a lot and remained moving with your heart, big respect fytb. Shit was breaking my heart when Deshae landed a few hits LMAO but foh BIG CINCO , BIG SHARK ! HELLOOOO
Cuh you should’ve beat the fucc out Deshae I know this old but cuh the whole family playing on yo top. You better than me..
Janky ass announcer
Deshae won , he dropped him . Horrible decision
jay cinco after rewatching this in 2024 he deff came back in 3rd round ..and won the second. first was close ..deshae big haymacker did stand out tho right in the beginning
They both did good and you can tell they both know how to fight
Seeing this shows they not no punks they will stand toe to toe   ❤
😅😅😅😅
Ngl dint da shae take boxing classes or did boxing 🥊 back in the day!?
They both did very good
Damn Deshae can fight good😮
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dashae won
Camera man was TRASH! Good fight tho
Cinco got dropped 😂 cmon all you non boxing knowing ass people, if the ropes hold you up it’s a knockdown
Deshae can’t fight tho but respect it takes a lot of guts to spent in a ring period doesn’t matter if the can fight or not
good job to justin bc deshae always boxes ppl
ngl the nigga who recordin this shit lowkey suckin
Cinco won though
🔥🔥

I'm tryna box dashae 💯
bro dub cant record for shit
Cuz said more than ANY OTHER NIQQA my sister dealt with 🤔 well got damn deshae how many was there
Them bois snapped om😂
Now we need a part 2
I feel like if he didn’t have them gloves on he’d beat the shit outta dashae
It was so quiet😮for a boxing fight
It sucks when your siblings end up with someone and you have to beef with them too when you also grow to love them but deshae has heart I love that! He don’t care for no pride on or off camera that’s love and for jay also too accept it too
Props to your trainers he seems good !

The apology at the end was way better than the fight but good fight
Deshae to small to fight at. Distance like that he need to close the gap
You can tell who’s been an actual fight and who hasn’t

All respect to both but Cinco definitely won clear as day. Deshae has much more training and still looks sloppy asf in there 😂💀 That boy been spending money on nothing it looks like. He looks like your basic street fighter, just rush in and pray for the best 😂💀💀💀🤦🏽‍♂️
Shit I think cinco took this this fight was good asf like dead ass best figh5 I've seen in a while.

Happy Deshae whooped dude ass he try to be tough all the time
Deshae apologizing was a real ass nigga for that everything he said was real and I respect him for it Deshae really got hands and some power jay good to though
I ain't gone lie at 2:40 deshae caught cinco something nice boy if they sint have gloves on and wasnt in the ring he wouldve dropped cinco that ring kept him from falling down completely. That was a real haymaker landed all around good ass fight though I thought it was gone some typical youtube fight where its staged and fake but this was real deal and was definitely a good ass fight.
Yo Cinco you looking like Bruce Lee in that thumbnail 😂
You did that Cinco! You have so much potential in boxing.

There was no winner it was an even fight!
We not gone act like Cinco not swift asf!!! He will beat tf outta some niggas in the street fr

9:27 bro almost knocked deshae out he definitely stunned off that punch
Deshae is gonna get knocked out one day throwing himself into punches instead of leveraging himself
Cinco can fight new Mayweather beat a Millionaire 💯💯💯

Big respects and dubs my boi 💪🏾🗣

Naw dashae won
Camera man needs to be fired
Boi almost hit em and made em do the rolly Romero 😂😂
*I didn't know Dub was that bad of a camera man.*
That was a good fight Jay Cinco but I really do think Deshea won that if anything it was a draw but you did well excellent actually for your first fight it just seem to me like the Shay connected more and threw more punches that connected but you threw a lot of that also connected if I was a draw in all honesty but keep it up great work brother
What is em shoes dd 😭😭
Good fight
Camera man had one job🤦🏽‍♂️
Did your big one
cheap
Yes congratulations on your winnings
Brooklyn this is all yours that is a fighter
Who TF is the camera man? Every time Deshae goes in, I don’t know if it’s a landed or missed punch! 🙄 like dude catch the footage 😂
Jay you had more than a couple days tell ‘em you had your whole life training you lol but ik it’s different so salute to you you have heart & hands👏🏾👏🏾you still remained humble in the end 💙
Bout 1: 10-9 tall guy. Bout 2: 10-9 short guy. Bout 3: 10-9 tall guy. Overall 29-28 winner tall guy
Who is the camera man braaaa
He got one good hit but fight wise you owned the whole match 💀
Desha punch like a bitch throwing his whole body w the punch😂
The ending had me tear up good for y’all ❤
He wouldn’t do that to ddg
Aye I respect the fuck out of Deshae and I already had mad respect it takes a man to do sumn like what he did after the match fr that man is a excellent older brother!!
L Cameramen Jay😔

I rock with jay but deshae won
Jay cinco did his best🤝
Also, camera man is terrible.
#35 on trending nigga 🎉
My man is rocking that rank top 😆
After 2:39 I had to exit the video.. god damn.
It’s the coaches going back and forth for me 😅
Is that coach wearing a crop tank top 😂😂😂wth
Mann y’all chin strong asf😂😂💯
No guns?  Good deal! Get it on!
I just thought about it ….Cinco beat Deshae with a bullet in his butt…..HOLY SHIT 😳
It wasn’t about  power it was bout contact and clean hits 🗣️💯
This is how real men squash a beef ...good job young bucks.
You guys need to work on conditioning. There were moments where you guys thrust your entire body just to land a "strong" punch but it leaves you vulnerable if a professional knew his way in the ring.
L camera man’s
You guys did a good job for not having any proper boxing technique, don’t know how to throw a punch, both exhausted after one round. Shameful, YouTube boxers have made the Sport of Boxing a joke.
Respect on cincos name 💖💯
Draw ????
No Guns No Weed Smoke No Rappers and No Females in the Boxing World ????
Camera man suck bruh lmao
This is What I'm Talking About Real Brother Men Lives Matters in the Rings and Outside talking and Believe in Each Other .
From this angle I can definitely see Cinco won that 💯. Deshae is still a good fighter tho.
cinco got the win clean, idk why the people in the background saying deshae won that but the amount of time he be punching cincos gloves, deshae only goes for the head but cinco punches everywhere missed alittle but he got the most good punches from head to the chin and body. Deshae punches cinco on the face while holding him at the back of the head that dont count 💯
17 trending 🎉🔥🔥🔥let’s go cinco
Yu n deshae should do a reaction to it together
There’s no doubt that cinco won but love too see it rather then people ready too take someone out & dragging things for the littlest things ❤️ much love to both

Jesus say, "But when the Son of man comes, will there be any faith on earth?" If you follow the Bible you will know that most all of the 1,800 prophecies has come to pass. Once the final few happen Jesus Christ will return. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Jesus is the Way the truth and the life. He accepts you no matter where you've been. So, believe in Jesus
You need to focus on boxing foreal.You got natural talent.

That’s how you do it… you went in there with confidence and fought with confidence, like I said don’t hesitate and combo up.. you hearted my comment and took it into consideration, you really did ya thing and ya both handled business like no other. Respect from me and whoever likes this comment to both of ya . Don’t listen to nobody if it ain’t bout gettin in the ring, a lot of people gonna talk about the fight and try to downgrade you but if they not tryna box you they’re self then don’t pay no mind. Congrats on your FIRST win FIRST fight.🤘🏾

Baby riches face the whole fight had me dying😭😭
Deshae won this fight yes Jay got good shots too man but Deshae handled the fight as an experience fighter. The ref guy is lost
This way better than king cid vs smooth gio😂
You did great, especially for your first time
Omg I love this 🥹 black men settling their differences like real men
this angle so much better, I feel like I see the punches wayyyy clearer in this video
Jay Cinco did his thang! Period!
WITHOUT THE GLOVE CINCO WILL REALLY HURT DESHAE NO CAP 😂
Why is Deshae shocked Cinco won, he got destroyed 1st and 3rd round
OUCH!!!!! 9:27 😂🤣🤣 Look at Dereks (guy in orange) face when CINCO KNOCKED 💥🥊Deshea teeth out.   🤣😅 I'm stuck on replay with 9:27 lol
Cinco lost nbs
Respect to ya both❤️
Yessirr, we trending
Watched it in slow motion I see why Cinco won
Just some wise advice I watched Brooklyn last video when you went over to her house you have to learn to read a woman jay I feel for you so bad cause you wear your heart on your sleeve but love yourself again you’re going to keep getting hurt giving an showing your love to someone who you can tell don’t want to be with you it’s disgusting to watch cause I’ve been there man prayers to you frfr you’ll bounce back champ
If somebody would’ve focused more on body shots there would’ve been a knock out for sure but Cinco quick asf definitely landed more punches 💯 great fight!!
My boy jhonny behind the cam💚
Dub the worst cameraman ever!!!!
Deshae won to me
Cinco you won 2-1 1st and 3rd rd yea he caught you the first round but you landed more you need to practice more you have a very good stance you can get a lot better also put your hands up more
Pop yo shit Jay!!!!!
this like my 8th time watching this 🤣 & I still think Cinco was the right decision
I like that you won I feel like Deshae underestimated you a little n been trying to pick fights with amateurs to gain a win knowing he been working glad you showed him you may be new to this but true to this 😅
💪🏾💪🏾
With a little more training from both sides, a knockout could’ve taken place in the first round. However, for some amateurs, if they even fall into that class, this was an ok fight.
Bro pulled out the hood anger 😂 for his respect I respect it had to bring the Win Home 💯
Cinco definitely took that one home 💯
L camera man
Deshae won
wtf😩🤣🤣🤣
What a good fight I've never seen so many young bulls willing to go professional and solve there problems the fight was tuff alot of power punches and combos I thought deshea would of took that one with a amazing punch to the face but Cinco came out with the W tuff wondering if they go pro are  future is in for some heavy hitters let$ go!!!!
Max respk
Fire that camera man
Yeaa nigga💪🏾 fuck what they say you won dat💯

When someone fight as wild as Deshae you need good technique & perfect timing to just know when to let him have it you got good posture cinco but you need to hit them weights and gain some arm power!

Whoever is recording behind this camera is TRASH. Don’t let him record again Jay💀
rocky
This camera guy kind of sucks. He was missing all the good hits.
I feel like everyone is thinking too deep in the boxing world cinco may have won but in REAL LIFE on the street someone punches u in the face tht many times? Yea deshae won
Good for you Cinco ❤
That was a good fight❣️
Bro yo camera is ass , he prolly tryna watch the fight instead of keeping a good frame
Good fight fasho
L camera man
Deshae fire your camera man
L camera man
Cinco was tagging tf out this nigga first round watch closely
Idk why they said you won, you got knocked so damn hard like multiple times and was Shakey 🤣
2:28 2:38
L camera man learn record better 💯💯 Buh great fight 🔥💯
Bruh! Who's the camera guy?  I came to see both angles of each fighter and barely saw it from Cinco view😩 because it looks like Deshae won from the angle I saw on his video
You whoop that ass bro even though yo first fight
Yessir I like to see men become real men Fight out professionally and move forward 👏🏾 (Jay White was here)
Jay won he  faster ,clean ,and took those hits no matter how much power Deshae tried throwing 👏👏👏👏👏👏a lil more power behind jay and he going to be unstoppable
Cinco got better ring presence, like he looks more comfortable.. he was really getting his rocks off
Justin a squabbler not a boxer yet he did got for his first fight dehshae did good to respect to both
Need new camera man smh
Cameraman got slower turns that a 16 wheeler truck
1-0 Cinco 💪🏾
Cinco got heart to get in that ring
coach cappin
You did great Jay and that just shows how much of a man you are! You stood up for yourself and standing on your shit 10 toes down
Nice bro
@5:00 why this mans top like that?😂
Bro who let this man hold the camera 😤
cinco was  ping ponging his jaw 🤣🤣💯

Good fight, ❤️❤️❤️
Yo Cinco fire your cameraman

Cinco won !!
The camera man had one job 🤣

Rule number 1 as the camera man  WATCH THE FIGHT THROUGH THE CAMERA NIGGA
Okay but L CAMERA MAN LOL
Nah.. Jay, you did REALLY good. I wasn't expecting that👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
And DESHAE that’s a man ! You turned it around boy .
why you beat that man ass like that jay lmaoo.
This was a good fight and I’m glad y’all both did your shit! Settled the score , you did good for your first fight Justin 💯👏🏽👏🏽
DeshAe need be a boxer
Darryl so extra 🤣🤦🏽‍♀️ he always wanted to do this
Cameraman is ass
AND BRO WHOEVER RECORDED FOR YOU IS TERRIBLE LIKE WDF BRO
Bro 9:28 Cinco Spared Deshae No Cap , Thats How You Know Cinco Really Fw Him . He Really Shoulda Bodied Him Right There
You did good Justine and I think you thaight you were going to loose but you didn’t even care. You stood up to your bully and it turned out how it should have. Dashae needed to be humbled and you did it the right way. He respects you now and that’s all that matters. I’m happy he apologized to you. My advice to you is “go where you are celebrated and leave where you are not.”
Idk who the hell recorded this but they did a shit job 🤣😑
Ovr CINCO WON! They Both Can Fight But you can tell cinco is a lil bit more experienced if you ask me. End of the day tho ,Good match and sportsmanship ❤️💪🏾
deshae won fsfsfsfsfsfsfs its rigged asf
cinco won by a couple points for sure
Taking into account Jay hasn’t trained to Box like DeShae…you done very well.
Aye the taller dude actually won wtf. I didn’t know bro had hands like that ngl. Boxing way different than street fights too.
Yessir Jay 👏🏾
I looked at both angles I’m not gone lie. Deshae won, he had more hits and he was more consistent. They must be blind if they think jay was the winner 🤦🏾‍♂️
Cinco got the basics down and was impressive!! Landed more shots. It was close but very good clean match up boys ! Way to hash it out! Move on and keep making content
Camera man u got 1 job folks
You have respect no matter what Cinco, Honestly you more mature & grown then deshae will ever be 🔥💯💯 . Didn't need box to prove it, but @ the end the day you won that🎉  Keep doing you, You got this. .
Cinco 1st round was yours because you landed more 2nd dashae 3rd was cinco cuz not a lot were landed clean from both but from what I saw cinco got like 2-3 good hits GGs to both of y’all boys for even settling it this way🙌🏽🙏🏽
Deshae fasho won 😭 they both did good tho🫡
Bro this cameraman eats ahhhh fr he can’t record
I think he lost wtf he won ? Wowww
The camera man was horrible

Good fight that’s how you know Cinco really can get down on a street level. This was quick training an learned street fighting. Much respect for them actually following through in the ring.
Cinco getting fucked up😂
Dude in the yellow annoying
Watching the fight from both angels ima have to give it to Cinco fr he connected more hits than deshae
this nigga got hands
Jay Cinco won
dat could have been a draw or  cinco won few points prediction befo they declare winner
Cinco You put in work
Wait he thought he won tht? Lol nah gang not this time deshae
U could’ve ended this fight the moment it started by extending your left arm towards his chin to bate him then take him with your right - good shii tho
Aye cinco dead homies u didnt dissapoint at all foo this was a great fight u put them gloves on cuhz 💯💯💯
fire the camera man
Ddg said some real nigga shit
I wanna fade baby rich, deshae line that up for me , rich and I the same size  im just older, he a chauncey . Always following behind ddg.
I don’t even know   Cinco But he has such great energy. Very humble and rare.
i like how the camera man cant record
Jay yo camera man suck
Great fight

Y’all not gone say it but I am. YEAAAA cinco let mfs know u not playing bout the disrespect
Lol why Deshae look like that at the end cinco fasho bagged that duby
For everyone that is saying Deshae won clearly doesn’t watch boxing. Cinco controlled the fight most of the time and landed the cleaner punches. I scored it 2-1 to Cinco. 1st and 3rd round to Cinco and 2nd Round to Deshae. Anyway, They settled this like men and I am proud of the both of them. Happy to see people finally fighting some shit out and resolving it.
great fight! I respect the fact y’all handled this the boxing way! definitely putting out a great message to the younger community on how to squash beef
L CAMERA MAN 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
The Way Tiktok Posted That Clip Made It Seem Like Jay Lost !!! But If You Actually Watch The Video They Both Was Whooping Eachother It's A Fair Tie To Me Good Shi🤝
Good job guys
Cinco vs ddg??? Jay really got hands
this camera man suck
Cinco did him wrong 3:18
💯💪🏾
jay Cinco fashoe gave him the work Deshae most definitely got some mitts tho
5:54 damn
You won the 1st n the 3rd
Just more money !
Real niggas
You did your thing for someone who had a few days to train
Jay bro if you were stronger you whoulda knocked that boy out with those shots use your body in your punches you’ll knock him out easy
Deshae got humbled
Respect 🙏🏾😍
Let this be the way y’all squash it & gain more respect for one another👏🏻  Good heart & fight shown from both of you🥊
Actually get to see the fight from your angle. You did that 💯 first boxing match too
Cinco got 1st
Ayeeee...congrats. You did great. You can tell you can fight in real life.
Yall still brothers 💙💙
Bro your camera man gotta go
This is pretty damn good for him to really train for a few days he's wild 🤘🏻💙
Okay I had to watch Deshae video because some of justin angles got cut off.   Cinco only had a few things to tweak. Def keeping your hands up.  I wish he could have gotten his muscle massage up, focused on strength training and endurance. I only imagine how exhausted you were. 1st round you were so explosive , I know u would have liked to keep your momentum.  Cinco foot work is Phenomenal
Cinco lost🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
Ya both put in pain real talk 💯💯💯
whoever recorded this needs to be fired, trash cameraman
Yes justin u did it
Dashae won
U guys must not like dashea cuz Cinco was not doging shit he was getting rocked b real
You should rap and start boxing I can see a future with both, for your first fight this was clean and professional you did amazing Ngl I honestly think you won cause you landed more hits and you was clean with it and fast with it. Deshae is a good boxer but he a wild boxer.
Good shit🔥
mad respect for you Justin on me you held your ground !
This honestly was a really good fight.
If you watch it again D landed mostly on gloves so that doesnt count regardless how powerful those hits were cinco landed more hits even if they were baby hits he landed on skin! Lol
This was a good fight 💯💪🏾🔥🔥🔥
Love these Dudes and all they drama best youtubers keep going up fellas
Deshae lost 😂😂😂
My anxiety while watching this video😂. But Goooo Cincooo👏
L camera man 💯
You won
that tank top he got on is crazy ngl
On me it was  a tie  🎯💯
Deshae landed a few power punches but Cinco landed more overall, countered, and out boxed him per say technically but a thin margin.
deshea got smke by jay Cinco
Cinco won he was clean & landed more deshae had power punches but very sloppy
Jay did not win
Aye respect to both y’all brothers at the end of the day everyone got an opinion all that matters was y’all settled with the hands and everyone still get to go home and more importantly there’s was respect at the end and y’all both shook on it max love that was damn good fight
Good fight, you'll fasho be a dawg with more time of training.. You got a lot of raw talent and potential boxing wise with that being your first time stepping in the ring !!
This was so hard for me to watch 😭😭
Yeah you got whooped
For somebody that’s never box before he definitely did his thing yeah deshae landed a lot of those punches but so did he.
U a true fighter cinco 🔥🔥🔥
Is it just me or does anyone else see that Deshae is fighting like he meant all those punches?
Deshae mad adorable!
go pro bro
Deshae had more significant strikes
foo you shoulda mopped his shit way harder that boy need it
Good shi both of y’all I think u should take this and start and getting in to boxing series just the basic really ik niggas don’t like fighting everyday and shit but uk it could be a good workout 🔥🔥
Man you need a New camera man Where is he recording at ?😂
So proud of u. You did it. Respect it all the way ❤❤❤
knew bruh would come out wit tht dub humbly keep workin n focusin on u gang
That was a draw
good fight but L camera man
That’s wassup y’all…. Good shit n good fight 🤜🏽🤛🏽
The camera man shit
Y’all both went hard y’all both got my respect
The camera man was pissing me off
I was cheering for Jay but when deshae made that apology i cried😢
I say it was a draw
Me personally I’ll whoop into both dem boys
you called it up and won it bro,good shiii
This was a great fight congratulations to you both
Jay’s camera man ain’t it at all he missing all the action on jay’s corner smh
Grrrrreat fight!!! You both did really good, but I did see too that you were the winner! Congrats, you have another career move you can make in boxing! 💯🙌🏼❤️
Worst camera man bruh 😭
Worst angle
Good fight but we the real Compton training. I saw how you really box before, but good fight
Good shii all I can say
Praying Before I Watch This My Hearts Broken😢 - Jelly Bean
You did excellent for your first time Cinco, keep it up because that was really good!!
Y’all are too young to be so out of shape. Put the weed and liquor down bro and get healthy. Good fight though. You did good but that punch Shae landed at 2:38 😳😳😳😳
Now I gotta go watch Dalane and dashae fight after this 😭😭
Them power shots were only but a little Cinco whooped deshae behind. Forget what. Deshae talking about lol. I got even more respect for Cinco cause he took punishment and stood his ground though.
Fired your camera man
2:40
Favoritism at its highest. If deshae would’ve won no one would’ve said shit about a draw. Jay cinco won cuz he was the better fighter. Deshae is a sloppy fighter 🤦🏾‍♂️
Favoritism at its highest. If deshae would’ve won no one would’ve said shit about a draw. Jay cinco won cuz he was the better fighter. Deshae is a sloppy fighter 🤦🏾‍♂️
I applaud jay cinco he did good for his first fight fr fr 💯🫱🏽‍🫲🏾 he definitely can get better
Dashae has experience on his side he was being sweet be honest
Hell yeah! I was rooting for you and you made me proud 👏 🥲 yeah 😂 shit I was impressed like a mf 👌 you won that shit for sure 💯 🏆
good fight Cinco.
Cinco won in my opinion every punch he threw landed Deshae was just going wild 😭😭😭
Cinco got hands he took light on him
Cameraman has one job 🤦‍♂️
Ryan vs Tank 🥊🔥😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Part 2
Man o Man  ...  if there was ever time I had to humble myself --- not really sure what fight I was watching the first time 🔥☁☁☁☁ lol  ..  But Cinco I owe you an apology.  Now that I  have seen both your and Deshae's postings  ....  I retracted everything I mention about Deshae Winning  -- FAIR is FAIR and Square  ---  you had a few Legendary connecting and powerful Hits Cinco -- I thought Slo Mo would tell me the truth  ---  but  Props out to  Dub for some good footage and whatever he missed I have seen on Deshae's channel  -- but now that I have seen both -- I have overturned my decision and Cinco without a doubt was the  Winner thru rounds 1 2 and 3  --  not to say that  Dehae didn't fight strong he also had some MVP moments   ,,,  I'm just a FAIR Person ... Respect to all Real life boxing score keepers  .. Final word: Brotherly Love Over all BS
With all the 💩 Deshae be talking I thought he was damn near a pro boxer. If Jay cinco trained for 3 months he would’ve slept Deshae.
Bob n weave king🎉💪🏽🙏🏽✅✅✅
I seen both videos and omm cinco did his shit bro was really tagging him not gone take away from deshae but cinco took the W
Jay give dat camera man some treatment💯😒
I respect how you paced yourself. Glad to see you guys work through your differences. Keep God first.
Best YouTube fight I seen.  They was throwing bombs from the jump. They crazy
BEST VERSION 🥊🥊🦾🔥🔥🔥 *deshae vid ain’t have all these hits, he cutted out some scenes of this fight
You did that for sure ! Good win Cinco !
💪❤️
He did good his first match ever
NGL yo cameraman sucks
This  was one of the best YouTube videos

Camera person trash
🔥🔥🔥
On me I ain’t kno you was bumpn like dat omg you snapped gangy😭🤧😤🥷🏾🖤💯
Much respect Cinco keep on keeping on 💯🥊💙
Cinco put on for the town good shit gang 🔥
i have to say when deshea first came out he was holding back until he seen how much hate cinco came out with. A person who has his family say ni##er u should never come off holding back on deshea
I was watching with one eye closed ooooh goodness did they really have to do this😅 I had to foward I just had to foward lol..
You definitely did you’re thing Justin props to you ❤
Gud shit doe
I’m proud they both handled it like men and as a professional boxer I think the both won it was a tied to me
Deshae was giving that nigga pressure💀💯Whole time
i see now 🤔 deshae done alot of air swings & lots of blocked throws!  both yall got some clean cuts tho
Justin did pretty good for his First time Boxing and I like how they both made up at the end.
Whoop his ass😂😂
6:00 XD
How you let this lil nigga do you like that lil bro 🤣🤣
Deashea gt a lot of problems huh.his fighting iz nt a solution. At the end wat worth noting
Respect
L cameraman
you got off on my mama !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love him his pop is right there in his corner supporting him!
11:25 got me dyin😂😂bro felt like he just ran a marathon
W Jay Cinco I watched it 10x & I had Deshae winning 1st round, beside Justin eating that clean shot and almost got dropped. 2nd & 3rd round Justin looked sharper than Deshae, I was very impressed with the pressure that Justin came with. He walked down Deshae the whole entire fight & Justin got that step back counter with his right hand, if the gloves were smaller Deshae would have walked in to that counter and gotten KO, it happened multiple times where Deshae kept feinting and feinting and would throw a wild right and Justin almost caught him twice. But I had Justin winning 2 rounds to 1
That emotional "fuck cuz" after deshay speech Cinco did. Yea, I felt that pain in him in that lil sec. Well done young king for holding you ground in that ring and as a young man trying his best.
Yooooo! I do not watch boxing but this match here was Soooo Entertaining!! I was rooting for you, Cinco!! You did great to have just a few days to train!! 👊🏾 I kept re-watching 8:38-8:46 !! You quick AF!!!! 😊
Aye them combos and etc was EVERTHING IDGAF you did yo thang
ddg is such a W frr❤❤❤
L camera man
Dubs
Good shit yo you got them licks
bro L camera man gd
Jay 💯
good fight both did yall thang💯
L cameraman
Justin I’m starting my YouTube grind. My goal is to record with you, great fight btw
I thought Deshae won 😂😂😂
I cried 😂😂😂😂😂 Deshae apology was too real
👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Deshae get back was on point💯
Cinco lowkey could actually be a boxer, street hands mixed with a lil knowledge, he could fight. Same thing with Deshae he just ain't have the coaching
His camera man sucks big time!
Ur camera man piss me off too tho😂😂😂. He was watching it on his own n forgot to record y’all mannn .
Worst camera man ever.
Good fight guys y'all did good... remember Jay keep God first and you'll be good no matter what..much love brother!
My boy Jay cinco I Fr see you actually doing boxing u got skill for it Fr u should practice more and do sum boxing YouTube videos
Cinco with the win 🥇 💪🏾💯
I aint gon lie cinco won that
Jay Cinco by decision 49-48, 50-47, 49-48
to this day i never understood why ppl who step in the boxing ring get so angry and heated when they get hit..its to be expected..shit im younger than these niggas and never got emotional after getting hit when i first started boxing..why is it so hard for some of these dudes to keep their composure when they get hit..fighting emotionally is how ppl get seriously hurt
Bro fell deshae swung straight frail for that
U hear tee tee saying “ ouuU “😂😂
Respect both to both of y’all
Why do you hit your gloves together when he hit you with a good hit you gotta control your temp in boxing bro
Whoever recorded this could’ve done better bruh
Camera man was dog shit like who was recording? Woohoo?
I respect both of y’all for handling the situation like men. This what men do fr. I don’t agree with the results however this was a great fight and for your first time you did good.
Good fight my boy🇲🇽🦾
🔥🔥🔥🔥
This camera man is bad at catching all of it
5 YOU U DID UR MATHA FUKING THING BRO MUCH LOVE AND RESPECT MY G SPAM W W W W W 💯
This was a good ass fight though.
This one of the greatest match ups Frost vs Cinco 💯💯💯💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🔥🔥🔥
W JUSTIN!!!!!!!
Let’s go Cinco!!!
I'm sick of deshae thinking everything is a competition steady trying to fight everyone , Cinco really don't wanna mess up him and desahe friendship you can tell
As soon as jay threw his first couple of punches I knew it was over 😭
I ain’t gonna lie for somebody who don’t box you actually pretty good you pursue it you and deshae this actually was a good boxing match
My nigga  Jay you did his shit on me that nigga Deshae thought he was gone do the homie in as expected justin came with some shit
Look at DDG facilitating.. lmaoo
Boxing is about more hits, which cinco did. Yes Deshae had a couple loud bangs esp that one in the beginning. Wonder if the apology was genuine at the end… didn’t seem like it but idk.
Proud u bro u look amazing for only training 4 days Compton made you tough
nigga from compton duh he got uh squabble overall good fade for somebody that don’t have no experience in the ring u held that shit down 💯 fam
Lmao u did not win
You making compton look bad neva
Ali vs frazier
Good stuff
Congratulations bruh
Deshae quick, clearly trains and he got  power but damn that nigga fight dirty. Hella illegal punches. Cinco a natural. Not a trained fighter but he got hands and he quick on his feet!! He’s a natural street fighter,  hard body foreal and it easily transitioned into the ring. If he keeps training he gone be hella raw. Plus he a real one at the end of the day. When he had deshae on the ropes he let up. That boy deshae had him on the ropes and was going for blood. Throwing hella punches out the hold smh. Nothing but respect for Cinco! BIG CINCO! BIG WIN! 🥇💪🏾
Camera man wtf
The camera man sighs!!!!!
Cinco won since the first round
that thumbnail go craaazy! lol  congrats man, you definitely won 🔥
GOOD FIGHT BUT CHINCO DEFINITELY DESERVE THAT W 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥊
For you to never box you carried .

Nawh y’all boys was throwing them bitches😂💯
Both are brave
The thumbnail got me hollering
You did good gang for yo first time 💯🤝🏽
am i trippen or did cinco catch the fuck outta deshae at 9:28 he caught him straight on the chin looks like deshae was hella rocked
Respect they was throwing them thangs frfr
i know everybody judging the fight is biased because they keep seeing the potential in Deshae and his punches instead of just giving justin his props nobody can accept it because they underestimated justin and also he not as popular he’s the UNDERDOG 💪🏽
L camera man
Your camera man was ass smh! Although it was difficult to watch the good parts. I truly believe from the angles we did see, you both did great. I feel like it was a tie…I would like to say you both held your own and had a great fight. Hopefully after this you both settled y’all  differences and moved on. Great job by handling it like men in the ring instead of going back and fourth on the internet or using gun fire. I commend you both 👏🏽
That shit was amazing I think it was a tie
I was yelling at my phone so loud! 😅 Jay you did good but I wanted you to Annihilate him! you played defense in the beginning but ended strong 💪🏾
the camera man is killing meeeeee

As someone who works in the boxing world, CINCO you got HANDS. A freaking natural. Very close fight, but you got this one. Imagine with more practice, you would have DEMOLISH him second round. Sometimes we focus so much on the head shots that we forget that the body shots would get him tired, to the point that he cant keep his guard up and then that’s when you go in for the head shot. Good job brodi, you look good out there!
Y’all Boi’s did that !! 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾 grown man shit!!
This was a good fight! Good job jay!
you beat his ass bruh lmao
Bro you ain’t win that tho cmon on now why Dashae always getting robbed in the ring 😂

Good fight! I say you practice and do a rematch, wearing them gloves is no joke

NGL hold dat L lil bro
to me deshae won but cinco’s punches were solid. whichever way im glad they squashed it. this is a really neat game icl😂.. i love it❤ we want more but not a beef ting
Round 2
Ik that man aint got on a crop top
this is manny pacquiao v de la hoya on 144p. jk it was a really good fight and i loved the technique from both of these guys... it was very professional.
Dashae would be good if he didn’t throw everything so hard
Cinco you highkey got hands. Box me and let’s set it up. You put up 500$ and I put up 500$ winner takes it. Lmk fam let’s set it up I’m big fan. It will be good video idea, “cinco fights fan for 1k” man let’s do it
Nobody really one they both landed some really good hits on eachorther.
Nah u did that💯
Now Brooklyn done stop messing with you because you decided to fight him so at the end of the day you lost her .
Cinco really got them hands 😂🤣 nigga showed he ain’t delane fr fr with this fight you can tell deshae really took it easy on delane lmao 😂
Fuck is wrong with the camera man
Deshae face when he raised your hand 😂
Mannn y’all was supposed to use dem 10 ounce gloves lol sht would’ve been WICKED😂🔥
Deshae won that ngl
Glad y’all got it out the waaay now run up ah bag 💪🏼
No u beat his ass omm fr
Deshea frost good swing but jay Cinco he good but in the end of the day they steel family
Cinco won Round1 (toss up) Round 2 Deshae Round 3 Cinco imo
Deshae did get a knock down, but Jay barely edged him out.  Good work by both!
2-1 Jay Cinco
L camera man
Mad respect for cinco real shit
tbh dashae definetly won. but if i was cinco i wouldnt trust dashae no on just says sum like that and be cc right after

Deshae I have tons of respect u did ur thing n I agree draw but more importantly the respect u 2 have now 4 each other is more important,u showed a maturity that is real...!jokester deshae is good to..1Luv n God Bless
cinco won that fasho
Handled yo binnes 💪🏽 Aye bra if u keep dropping music consistently you gon go somewhere DON’T STOP.
I watched the fight from both perspectives. My opinion.  Round 1: Deshae Round 2: Deshae or Draw  Round 3: Cinco  It should’ve either been a draw or Deshae should’ve won.
ayy Jay got a Bruce Lee body type 🤣 #nocap
Dashe was whoop that boy ass
The uk 🇬🇧 stands up and salutes both fighters but cinco 1 did a banging job first time in the ik salutes cinco ..both fighters had a great perfume so well done
deshae don't ever speak on a nigga tryna do better for himself . nigga try to look down on niggas in the hood. good shit cinco . WILMINGTON CA
I feel like ddg always wanted to say that standing in the ring cause he held that shit 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 but good fight yall
Camera man sucks 🤦🏾‍♂️
W video L camera man
Thumbnail got it 😂
You should remix Arguments by DDG and name it Brooklyn pt.2, I feel that’s a beat you would really flow on Brodie
W
This may have been his first fight in for his first, but he won fair and square I don’t care when he says the proof is in the video doesn’t matter what deshae thinks or say Justin won that fight fair and square and took them hits like a man
Cinco didn’t need no training he got it in his blood🦍💯 deshae been training so y’all can’t compare there fighting skills
Wtf is the cameraman looking at 😂
Dam this was a good fight didn’t know jay had hands like that
You’re just beat ur girlfriend big brother 😂😂😂😂 😂
This shit is crazy
deshae is a pitbull lol I hope this a trend instead of gun fights, hopefully they can be done good job guys
DuB is a L cam man
ian gon lie deshae won i respect both ian pickn sides shit crazy yu defenitly stood ya ground tho 💯💯
No cap I couldn’t tell who one but tht shit was a great fight
Cinco won and  landed more punches , deshae did have a few good power hits nice fight tho after all.
You did good my boy, Deshae looked more professional but you still got em and won 🤝🏾

Good job I won $5 off you
It's the ending for me, okay Brooklyn take Cinco back
TEAM JUSTINNNN🤪
Ngl who ever recorded it don’t ever allow them to record smh missed all the good parts 😤😤😤
The camera man sucked.
Camera man was terrible step out the ring maybe?
Good stuff !! Nothing but RESPECT.
Jay did so well. Nigga had only one person coaching him buh deshae had the whole gang coaching him, that shit lame for me
not go lie u were fighting good but no cap u didn't win that
From time this start I laughed until it was done😂😂😂😂🙌
L camera man
🥇🦈
Nigga cinco get sturdy 🤣
Great shit Cinco, all in all ya respected each other I feel like ya won that but yo whoever ya cameraman is fire that nigga yo on me, homies was pissing me off 😂
would love to see more boxing videos fr these are entertaining
Real life jay cinco winning … Dashae been training for 2-3 years and cinco did his thing take boxing serious at least the training feel like that would help wit the depression trust me I kno we going thru so,e of the same shit
That’s what’s up👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Ion care Justin had that for sure they both did great
being honest deshae won 2/3 rounds with more effective punches  the most you can say is they tied
Idk about y'all  but I fucks with both of them but I wanna see Cinco win ijs
Proud of u cinco
I watched Deshae vid first and this angle really shows why they said Cinco won Deshae had a couple of power punches but Cinco landed way more punches
the thumbnail kills me 😭
You did not win
Y’all both did good I thought Deshae not on no hating sh!t
Yea fasho u won
People who really box know who won just cause deshae had a few good looks doesn’t mean he won boxing isn’t just bout how hard you hit it takes skills cinco had it all deshae was just swinging 😂and y’all think he won smh cinco won good work my boi
Camera man was trash
Boxing coach here,first round Cinco edge him second round DeShae won third round deshae allowed him to get off even if a man isn't landed clean becauae he was the more active one in that round Cinco took it and he also landed some good shots
I’m so proud of you Justin!! It took a lot of guts to get in that ring! Deshae almost made me cry at the end with the apology😭 Love that y’all can still have respect for each other at the end!!❤❤❤
They boxed like men
he was taking breaks🤣🤣💯
So it y’all doing this to beef or to settle it
Yall saying cinco loss lol hell nawl 😂
Deshae still beat yo ass bro the ref was smoking shnickelfritz if he really think u got a Dubb 😂 respect but u still took that ass whoopin 🤣
deshae won i think but jay you can fight and ur stance is there keep going ❗️🖤
Nahhhh Jay you did that idc , you got no training in the ring at all and was handling him 💯💯🤘🏽
Crop top dude hella teek
good fight justin... you got heart i can tell dont ever change and always stay humble as you are, only the real gone see you for who you are.. you can take the boy out the hood but you cant take the hood out the boy and that shit gonna go over alot of yalls heads..
Cinco cameraman so ass
If we was in the the hood it a prolly be a tie it was times niggas on both ends could’ve got stomped
Bro L camera man
damn jay ain know u was like that😭 & we seen the full thing
Fire the camera man
i be seeing this nigga ddg every where
Camera man was shit Ian gone lie
Cinco should use boxing for therapy
OFF DA STRENGTH OF JUSTIN & DESHAE BOXIN IT OUT LIKE MEN AND GIVIN US A GOOD RESPECTABLE FIGHT, SHOW LUV TO BOTH OF DEY VIDEO'S. THIS WAS BETTER THAN ANY "YOUTUBE" BOXING EVENT EASILY.
Cinco did great tbh
Worst camera man ever
Jay nice one, you don't practice that much but you are really really amazing, you boxed him really bad, Deshae will learn how to be humble.
Cinco caught the win let’s go
i seen Deshae Frost throw so many illegal punches like he was putting his glove behind your head to keep you there and throwing punches im surprised no one said anything about that
Damn I didn't know jay knew how to box like that
😭 I'm dead. They boxing frfr
you won 🔥
Congrats Justin you have earn your respect thank you for beating his ass💪🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
Bro whoever is recording FIRED AF bc wth
ionc wat nbdy say u did yo shii to not even workout everyday and this bein yo first time boxing 💯
Nah just could’ve been a boxer if he wanted too
Deshae won but it was a good fight 👏🏾💯
Wtf deshae got him, I don’t see how cinco won 😂
me vs cinco https://youtu.be/Lknju_ovSw0
Cameraman sucks 🤣 missed just about all the good shots
dashae definetly won
No way Cinco won that fight. Its either a clear Deshae win or a close draw. Deshae landed more power punches and had Cinco on his heels more!
Bro u won how u beat up ur sister older brother u a bad man
🥶This was good
from this angle I see how justin won
You should have someone else recording, I barely could see.
I just need to know what dumb ass has the camera and please don’t let them record for you again.
DESAHE LETS RUN THE FADE 🤣you can’t box when you in New York slide to my gym would love to spar
Deshae rushes a lot then just stays flat footed tired cinco if you came over with a hook when you were shelled up and he was trying to break your guard when he exited you gotta throw at hook honestly deshae wins that just cuz of shots landed imo but he sucks you can beat him easy use yah jab next time step back pop him with the cross lights out
Y’all need a better camera man next time
Deshae won that fight I'm not go lie!!
Camera man had one fucking job just fucking pathetic
Is it me or does it feel like ddg rocks stilts now😂
He piped Brooklyn after this fasho 💯💪 good shit but I'll still get down on you nigg@$
You could legit become a pro boxer if u wanted to take this serious! You’re quick on ur feet w/ fast reflexes. U just need to put more power behind ur punches but you did good bro ‼️
❤️
Hold on this Fight is from a Whole different angle ---  To Be FAIR and Square .... I have to see your side of this Journey🤔
🔥 Respect to Both handling they differences like men good match up too they both was throwing them Thangs 💯
Big up yo self Cinco.. you danced that nigga out
Family will iron out there business Good Shit Cinco
You can fight for your first time
Real men!❤️💪🏽😇
Only men could fight like this and stay friends/brothers afterward…. This call release bad energy towards each other and friends once again
JAY CINCO🥊🥋
L camera man.
Wtf wrong with the camera man 🤨🤨🤨 he missing the fight
You did really good with just a few days ! ❤
Good shit you got that, you landed almost all your punches that’s work!! Especially for 3 days of training… and you got your respects💯🤝🏽
Aye both y’all nighas got hands y’all both handed it out like men respect💯
Came over to the Channel to Subscribe and show some love ... FIRE FIRE FIRE -- send it on  Deshae Post....  Thats Real Brotherly Love --- Nice Job  Cinco
Def a draw but Respect 🫡💯
Ddg shoes is crazyyy🤣🤣🤣🤣
You got him with more sick power shots
Good shit boy 😂!!!!
My nigga cinco ate them shots cuh but fa 3 days in training he a goat
Person recording was ass but good shit cinco 💯🥊
Cinco did good he quick with his hands
The cameraman is horrible 😮
this shit is not about who wins bro but is about respect
you did way better that delane or whatever the fuck bro name is😂😂
Yo the thumbnail is crazy 🤪  nice fight tho🙅🥊
great fight as a boxing fan i score it 3-0 cinco i think had overhands and hooks he def was the power puncher but he was jus at a disadvantage to cinco reach and counter he jus had better head  movement great fight tho deshae coulda won with better conditioning cause of power but he got so much better but not ready for ddg yet
A LOOKING AT DESHAE'S VID I''LL TAKE THAT BACK YOU WON THE FIRST 2 ROUNDS, DESHEA TRY TO WIN IT IN THE LAST ROUND. HE DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO BE LIKE THAT.
This was a hood fight, if cinco continue to train he’ll be a beast. You can tell he know how to street fight tho
nigga had on a belly shirt😂😂😂😂
Ayyyyyeee respects
I gotta see a blueface V.S.  DDG fight Just saying😂🤷🏾‍♂️
YALLLLLLL GOTTTTT ITTTTTT INNNNNN 🔥🔥
Brook go be mad
I don’t comment like that but deshae should’ve won he been boxing way longer you got Cinco who started training less then 5 days deshae is big head asf let cinco train a lil longer he will do some damage cinco you did great ❤
With more training I think u can take ddg
9:25 was crazy 😮
Salute young men. Nothing but respect 🫡
Let’s get ready to rumbleeeeeeee DDG is hilarious big fan watch all you guys it’s amazing the YouTube family you guys have made hope all is well congratulations on all your success and StaySafeStayHealthy
4:03 look how the coach in the yellow changes his facial expression 😂
Big W's congrats my boy 💪
💪🤩🤩🤩
L fucking camera man
actually looked good for 3 days of training wtf
Bro yo blocking is kinda crazy
Let's go Cinco
You lowkey a natural coming from a boxer, work on that defense and technique more you would be clean as hell, you just keep yo chin up
This is how I think Cinco Won .... he landed more shots and Deshae landed better power punches but tailed off in the third . Slips down dont  count as knockdowns . I would said Cinco was very strong in the first tailed off a litte in the 2nd and in the third he finshed strong in the third. I would say 2 to 3 rounds for cinco it was a close fight in a close fight it could have easily went as a draw also!
L camera man
Let’s keep it real not alot of people would’ve handled it liked they did , honestly a better fight than most of these YouTube events be putting out and the thing is we got it for free
💀 cinco won he landed more shots 🤷‍♀️ the only good shot deshae got him was the face shot
camera man sucked, deshae came in with that energy 2nd round but Cinco def got them hands home grown
Your camera don’t have too much filming experience lol he was watching himself lol
When skinny N*ggas don't do cardio, my dude look like he about to die, 😆 he exhausted as hell, LoL I'm glad it didn't get too serious though, because you know how it is when dudes get into any competition, they end up not speaking & beefing LoL. 💯 😄
Watch deshae thumbnail and then j cinco thumbnail lol.
Nobody gonna talk about how u can get sue for saying “letssss get readyyyy to rumbleeeeeee” 😂
Cinco got them bitches tho omm✊🏾
...practicing on breathing is important.
U learn quick 😂
Real shii
Amazing boxing match cinco!
i should slap tf outta dub why would he record like that🙄😂
Bravo cinco de mayo🎉❤
I’m tryna get in these frfr
omg wth who is recoding they suck😂
As a boxer I see potential in cinco he decent for a first time boxer if he jabbed more went to the body more N got more comfortable N a little bit better defense he could be hella good
You tried to play deshaes training and say that meant nothing but he proved you wrong asf🤣💯 he dodged most of your slow ass hits and came back and pieced you up almost each time 🤷🏾‍♀️
Anybody that see this video can clearly see Cinco took that W!
Dub suck as a cameraman
Sorry Justin you lost like a mf 🤣 all the mess you was talking I fs thought you was finna come with the heat🤷🏾‍♀️
Good fight, you did your thing in the ring. Much respect 💪🏽
Your camera man is some shit at recording he missed the ur good hit
For your first time you did good bro you stand your ground and you handle business glad Y’all work it out keep up with the banger videos 🔥

Nigga I thought Deshae thumbnail was wild

If your punches were tighter and if you would've put that jab out more you would've taken him out quick
Decent amount of training vs a lil training, you did good
These niggas really got it in
L CAMERAMAN
Fire the camera man. Great fight
Proud of you my boy‼️‼️ I was telling Mfs to stop doubting you I knew you had hands & deshae was throwing sloppy Shii
I'm just saying
Who did your camera cuz it wasn't on point who did your camera there was kind of slow getting all the shots so somebody to do it better
Respect Jay stepped in the ring with little training and WON
yall just gon keep changing the thumbnail lmfao
Deshae always talking you humbled his ass real quick
BIG L TO THE CAMERA MAN FOR CUTTING OFF THE LEFT CORNER ACTION.  I WANNA BOX HIM LOL
That’s how men handle things ❤❤❤it
Jay camera man sucks bro 😒 but good fight jay got power for sure
Not gonna lie I couldn’t tell who won that fight it looks like both tied up 😭😭
Nah that punch to the face was critical 2:38
Deshae can fight though no bullshit
that was good just be man not boys life is to short for all the stupid things that we do in this world that is just my opinion you can take it how you want to
Probably wouldve moved faster w da 12
Whoever his camera man is, is missing angles bruh.🤦🏾‍♀️
Dubssssssssss my brudda!
Cinco with the stick and move real shit the man is fast I'd think twice before getting in the ring with him.
Gangsta cinco you got it bro love bro 👑🦾
Justin deserved this W fr fr
Yea I think cinco won he got more clean hits. Deshae just threw more and he got him with more power shots. If you going off official boxing rules than cinco out pointed him.

Well done Cinco, this was your first ever boxing match and you did pretty much good..your moves and the way you landed punches has  a great message to your next opponents. Think about it, we got a big boxing star here ❤
I watched this match like 10 times all I can say is Deshae won that fight bro no cap
I think Cinco won too
Great fight! It literally could’ve went either way. Nobody’s gave up or backdown. It was a clean fight and the love y’all gave each other after the fight says it all. Good job guys! 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Respect to both men for boxing and getting into the ring like warriors nothing but respect for both of them at the end of the day also respect to Jay cinco for getting in there this man trained for about like 3 days and got in there with deshae and it’s obvious that deshae has more experience than him when it comes to boxing 🥊 nothing but respect for Jay for getting in there with him. 🙏🏾
My thing is what boats is ddg wearing! Idc how much they cost yuck but good stuff my boy. Both of ya good fight i can’t lie!!!!
Forever team Cinco he has heart fr fr

W cinco
Ngl i watched both videos and it seemed really close but now that i see this video deshae actually did miss some shots because he got no reach on his video it looked like a lot landed…

WWW
The cameraman sucks ass!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬
Wow. Good fight. Do you eat well(beans/corn bread/greens/mac/cheese).
Great fight indeed 🔥🔥🔥
I really didn’t want this to happen 😩
Speaking as an ex boxer, this was a really good fight especially for Cinco since it was his first time in the ring🥊🤌🏽❤️
2:39 damnnn LMAO
Deshae won that joint.. good fight 💯
Naa bro you've earned my respect for real! Good shit!

Caught that dub! 💯💯 yessir fuck a lame
Bad camera guy
He did way better than delane because deshae moped the floor wit delane
Go Jay !!!! We are all proud of you!!!!! Mad respect💯
Justin could really be a boxer if he take it serious frfr
Big for nothing... that the best you can do? You should apologize for talking like you can fight. You had the reach and still couldn't do nothing. You looked worried and the people in your corner looked embarrassed of you
OMM DESHAE WON! I love both of em tho.
deshae frost a square the man cannot fight
I tuned in like it was fight night.
Iknow Yo Daddy Aint Inna Crop Top
not gon lie this camera man was getting me tight 😂
bro been the phone the whole fight has me crying and Cinco has some hands high key
Deshae defo has more power but cinco blocked most of the shots. Deshae also has way more experiencez
Good fight , but camera man fired.
Congrats brotha proud of you for earning yo respect now a mf will think twice tryna disrespect you 💯✍️🏆
That deshae 🥊🔥 cinco didn’t expect that🙀🙌🏾
Dat was great fight
Wtf the camera man doing

I’m glad Cinco won that one! I knew he was. Niggas gotta put respect on my dawg name.
Cinco you did yo shit lil bro he was holding u but u still took the dub
Respect but u definitely lost gang
Wwww
Aye jay cuh 😂why yo coach wearing a crop top 😂
L camera man 😂 I can’t even see the fight I see nothing but the ceiling
You won that and it’s crazy cause deshae supposedly know how to “box” and you don’t and still put hands on him lol
Round 1 - Yes that power punch by Deshae but Cinco caught him with a couple tht round too if you look. (Close Tie, or Deshae) Round 2 - Hard. (Tie, or Cinco) Round 3 - Hard. (Tie, or Cinco)  Cinco boxed cleaner/more organized than Deshae. Deshae landed the power shots but Cinco more cleaner shots and overall. Cinco boxed better and Deshae hit harder.   Winner - Tie or Cinco.  Actual Winner lol - Cinco
Deshea got him a good one in good fight y’all 💯
Camera man only had one job 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Yo camera man is ass…we missing all the hood parts
You did GREAT!!💪💪👊👊
AINT NO WAY YALLL WAS REALLY GETTING IT BANGING GOWD DAMMM
for the ones that actually box then you know cinco won. deshae threw alot but jay landed way more.

👏🏽👏🏽
You did not win. Deshae tore that face up.. You ran the whole time, none of your hits were memorable 😂 but lil dude beatin yo face in will never be forgotten

That boy Deshae hit cinco with a 5 piece combo from Popeyes 😂😂
im mad af at the camera man
Good fight fr y’all did that
It’s 10:34 For Me I Replayed That Bitch Like 8 Times
Justin is not a boxer but with enough training he wouldve really did his thing good job tho bounced right back whenever he got hit and he did get some good hits to Ds face that slowed D down ... now lets not forget that deshae has been in the ring a few times and has more boxing experience i give it a draw but ima say this Jay is a (gloves off) street fighter lol
DUB YOU CANCELED WORST CAMERA MEN EVER!!!!
No cap, you was connecting dem bitches 😂❗️

Jay Cinco hits lethal🤞🏾 he did good
Deshae has good stamina. Jay cinco can fight though. I rather watch this than the boxing now
The way deshea though it was going to be him 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think Deshae won or it was definitely a draw but for your first match u did good
Lmfaoo i under estimated Justin I thought deshae was gone paralyze that boii 😂😂💯
Bro Derek face expression at 9:29 when cinco hit deshae😂😂😂

Cameraman was horrible
Camera man was gmt lowkey 😂😂
Cinco won
did way better than delane ..... I think bro chin still hurt
justin lowkey won that ad espitally only 3 days good job my boy u was goood wit them upper cuts good job bro
If it was an actual match jay would have won due to points💯💯
Whoever recorded this needs to never record again😭
The camera guy needs to be fired. Couldn’t even watch the whole fight🤦🏾‍♂️
Cinco did good for the few days he had to train.. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
YOU MAKING HIM EAT HIS WORDS I LOVE IT PLEASE KEEP BOXING 😩
This camera man sucks
U snapped my boy🦾🦾
They rumbled for real. Cinco did his thing considering he only had a few days. I have so much respect for you Cinco. Stand up dude. But it was good Deshae apologized!!! It was only right!
Bro this the best Fight I’ve ever Seen On Youtube 🔥
Respect 🔥❤️
DESHAW WAS LITERALLY COOKING HIM
🥵
NAH THIS RIGGED OR SUM
Good shit Cinco💯💪🏽
Good win Cinco! You definitely looked like the more polished fighter considering you only had 4 days to train! You had a lot of clean punches and combos! Looked good out there bro just learn to keep a solid base so you don’t slip 💪🏽💯
Congratulations
I need my fade with the camera man
L fucking cameraman💀

Even me knew u was gonna win before even watching the video JAY CINCO💪🏾💪🏾🖤🖤big fan from west Africa Senegal 🇸🇳🇸🇳🇸🇳
Excellent fight cinco and Deshae both were fantastic
I didn't see Brooklyn.. wonder why she didn't go?
If cinco had more stamina. He woulda fasho won 💯
Y'all's thumbnail are gold
This shit was crazy 💪🏼
I felt like cinco landed the cleaner shots props to both of y’all for the squabble 🔥
This was his first time fighting this shit crazy 😭😭
Ddg said Aries what you want to do or it was dub 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Y’all did your thing’s for coming out as man it doesn’t matter who won respect both of them , I like the way y’all hand shake at end respect  I like the way DDG said at end day  we are family respect this how you handled instide of hurting each other Much respect both of them the GOATS 💯💯💯
I HAPPY ASF IM IN MY ROOM DANCING AROUND MY MANZ STOOD HIS FUCKING GROUND ND LET EM KNOW 💯🫶🏽😘
Deshae kept rushing him jay still get a w idc 😂😂😂😂 he hit that chin so many times bro 😂😂😂😂
Let’s goooooo
Deshae won fs
He didn't win foh
Good fight
OKKKKKKKKKAYYYY Periodtttt y’all did y’all thing
Cinco did good for his first time … they both did good it was a good fight … and @9:27 cinco almost had himself a knockout
Yo ahh took ah mean ahh L 😮😅😂😂
Respect to y’all 💪🏽💪🏽
Good stuff jay yall both surprised me fr❤🔥
Respect to both 💯
2:39 GYATTTT
I love the fucking hustle and heart jay came in the ring you can already see in his eyes he ain’t come to play. Trust me everyone wrd to bro if he had more time in the lab that would have been dashae top. Jay got height and nmw dashae loves to swing and put his head down. Jay got way to long of a wingspand if he had that extra time and grind in the lab I guarantee he would have landed more hits and even won that fight by a long run. We support you jay from doing something totally different and getting what you felt was right because of your feelings and emotion no one deserves to be embarrassed or made fun off just cuz dashae felt like it was right . Much love 💯🙌🏼
Cinco dad fine asf and friend with the hat🥵🥵🥵
U won that lol
This wasn't fair at all because d.f been training off and on for over a year Cinco  only trained for a few days but with that being said cinco awesome job d.f you got what you wanted now calm the fuc down and before any of say anything I know I left the k off ✌️
If Brooklyn doesn't get back with Cinco, I hope she get with a 6'4" 300 bodybuilder and then we'll see how Deshae acts towards him. Deshae always tries to punk Brooklyn's boyfirends and because he is so materialistic Deshae always talks about their clothing, that is a sign of somebody who never had anything. And, we know Deshae never had anything and he came from nothing!
No bias stuff but deshae keep just trying to make wild punches to make it seem like he winning
Cinco stop smoking start training I swear you can go far in the YouTube boxing scene and get ur bag
I respect it… both y’all got my respect today
boy ya did thing had dude dazed abt four or five times no bapppp
Deshae fights dirty he’ll hit you if you get down instead of lettin you get your fair 😂
L CAMERA MAN 💀
Jay won! But y’all both did good type shit.
This is totally bias now clearly to be seen that deshae won this fight🤦‍♂️😂
2:38 Deshae popped the shit outta you 😂😂😂😂😂
The Champ Is Here!  Although, it was kinda a draw, with little to no boxing experience versus Deshae having previous training, was a W. ✊🏾💪🏾
Lowkey cinco got it ngl after the first round he started hitting deshae with some shit 🤣
I just wanna kno who was recording ? Bc it was parts I’m tryna see n the camera was facing the opposite way
Cinco you did awesome…and if you boxed all the time like Deshae it would have been bad for him, real bad…😮
Jay had the better corner, but his half shirt though 😆 that was a good fight though 👏🏾
Jay u ain’t come to play.
deshae know he still finna be on bullshit
I’m sorry but whoever was recording did a terrible job
You did really good!!! I was rooting for you the whole time. I’m so proud and only a few days of training vs him doing this all the time!!
Jay cinco got them hands 😂😂
L camera man
I'm glad deshae lost
Great fight
Nahhh cinco did his thing 🔥🔥
Mad at the camera man missing some of those shots lol i know it was good bro had you forget you were recording
L Cameraman
You’re mad underestimated and they didn’t see this coming. Just prepare for the jealousy/ envy, walk cautiously 👁
Great video
😁😁😁😁😁😁🤳
Y’all both did y’all shit 💯 but at the end deshae said he respect u the most outta all his sister ex’s. I might be trippin but didn’t d6 lil brother box him. I just went back and seen that he did I remember that shit now dashae beat that nigga asss😂😂😂 Imagine what cinco would’ve did to blood
Man time shit
King shxt 👑
Good fight 10/10🔥🔥🔥🙇‍♂️🤗😎🐐
🧡🔥
Let’s gooooo
He put them paws on you brother
Big W
Honest truth! It was a tie . 💯
CINCO❗️ Stay with boxing. I think that could be a great outlet for you man. Y’all both did great but your punches were more consistent, strategic, and tactical. Boxing is a technical sport. Plus your dodging ability is A1. Proud of you man🔥🔥
Ummm gud fight but you did not win that.. I watched it over n over you did not win
Jay Cinco won, but using the jab more would've made it way more  unanimous!  Man had Deshae stunned in that last part but didn't go for the KO I guess cause he was tired, but Cinco won on cleaner, connected punches while Deshae, who is supposed to be the more experienced one, was wild and irresponsible with his punches, but Deshae almost had the one punch KO at the beginning when he caught Cinco lacking for that little bit, but if Cinco had used the jab more, this fight would've been over sooner🤣🤷🏿‍♂️
Fire camera man
Frost won
Watching from this video make u see how much cinco was actually  connecting especially first round.
yo camera man suck g
Cinco did really good
Im glad deshae apologized cus he was wrong
Gotta work on ya  breathing
BIG CINCO!!! Not the little one!! I’m so proud of you man stg 😭👏🏽
I’m so confused how everybody like we family but none of y’all on cinco side Fr like damn y’all supposed to give both of them advice not just one and Deshae was not fighting fair how cinco was
Please remember he only had a few days to train, he did good for the first time!
Good fight but camera man was on bs😭
Great fight
Shout out to both of them I respect both of them for stepping in there an settling it on the ring 🥊 up 🔫 down 💯
Doing It For Domo 🌎🕊️
W great ass fight
Nah Thas wild dashae won that but good fight fs
Cinco won
Jay cinco shoulda made 9:27 / 9:28 the picture to the video.. the part after the punch land.. gotta push play then pause it fast. Crazy punch / pic
Y’all did y’all thang 💪🏾
Cinco should look into boxing tho fasho! He really would be hard
L camera man
Justin hit more and landed more ! Ain’t no DRAW BIHH 🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You definitely got him on this one. But much respect to the both of you for being men about it
good fght you did good bro
Bro deshae didn’t punch him into tht corner deshae punched him it connected but jay tried to weave it den tripped backwards into the corner he didn’t punch him into the corner oms 💯💯
It’s a tie y’all both got it 💯
Cinco could box fr if he wanted to💯He dis his shii and considering he only trained for three days
Nah I first I thought da was a draw but good shii from both of them cinco really from the trenches good shii 🔥
Respect for both but deshae won cinco you clean just need power but deshae punches not a little wild n clean you will have a problem
Bro in a street fight deshae is over wit frl tbh but if jay trained more like really get into it boii on my ma deshae not gonna fuck with him bc he already better and natural now if he trained he’ll be way better den deshae he is now better den deshae be honest everyone but they both did they shxt 🔥💙
🔥🔥🔥🔥
That was a good fight
That thumbnail had me weak 😂😂😂
Good fight Jay Cinco!!
Periodddd I knew jay was gonna win 🥇
After seeing this pov, I feel it was fair that they gave Cinco the win
Camera Man was ASS all in all good fight
Keep your hands up bro, u lucky Deshae frost can’t hit😅
The fact he nvr trained before or like been in the ring is crazzzyy, He did good👏🏽👏🏽.
You did that you can tell you a street fighter u know how to fight no training and Deshae know from learning through training
Jay should definitely look into boxing. Imagine if he had training too, MAN! 😮‍💨
Y’all both look dumb😂
cinco won💯💯💯💯 deshae fight like a bitch😭 he got little man syndrome
2:38 if the ring wasn’t there u would feel no 🧢
NAHHHH I fw this y'all both was getting busy
Let’s go CINCO NICCA. It’s time to really discipline and hit that gym and get some power behind those attacks cause nigga you gots hella potential and I was rooting for you big dog!!! Straight up !!!
This was all over the place 😮‍💨 and Shay can’t box is good as he say he can he just rushing people using his weight not really throwing combo’s It honestly and truly look like Cinco was holding back on him for some reason
Can’t believe Brooklyn really gonna stop messing with him because of the fight! They still cool after the fight, she’ll get over it
Nah ong cinco won he countered every hit
Nah no cap cinco got them bitches 😂💯
Jay did his thang and he definitely back up what he said and frost  is a real one bro is a dope big bro for looking out for his sister but they both did they thang good job dub on the camera
Let’s go cincooo🔥💰🖤
8:44 😂😂 Deshae really tried it
Tie! Great way to handle this problem. Respects to you
Deshae Won. You looked more technical, though. If you stick with it, you might have a career in boxing.
i feel like you did good to never have boxed you just got to get a little more power behind them hits. my opinion thst nigga still fake ash lol anyone that say shit to hurt you really been having side conversations about you and just be looking for the opportunity to embarrass you
Good shit 💪🏾
You had one job cámara guy
Best YouTube boxing match outa erbody in y’all group that boxed Nocap
First time boxing cinco ? That was actually nice... When you get your fundamentals right you're going to be a beast💯💯
YES SIR
Cuh dis camera man needs sum practice 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️stiff ahh
Whooo I was waiting for this I’m just now watching 🙌🏾🙌🏾🤯
U did yo shit
Some more training you could really do something.
Justin did wht he had to do. He won in opinion!
You could tell Justin daddy don't trust Deshae. That look😆
Idk if this fight thing is ent but y’all did y’all thing 🙌🏾🤩
Who ever recording this did ashitty ass job no cap. Acting like he was scared to get hit
10:13 that shit was clean😭
If was an tie hands down but dashae got more hits
Good shi jay and dashae yall handled dat shi like men
get a new camera man cant record to save his life
Been waiting good shit cinco
I Think It Was Too Close To Call
camera man don’t know how to record😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥💪🏼
Good job to the both of yall...good job justin
Being Completely Honest Cinco Won The First Round Deshae Won The Second Round And Cinco Won The Last Round So Cinco lowkey Took The W
Boy Deshae walking into to many punches I’m not gone 🧢 cinco could’ve got deshae out of there wit a uppercut if he timed that hoe right deshae was lunging in to much
Bruh Deshae is just throwing wild punches😂
Deshae kept the pressure but Cinco's countering is what makes me feel that he won Cinco had more clear shots W Cinco
Derek's reaction to every hit is hilarious 😭😭😭😭😭
CinCo 2-1 Cuhz‼️
CinCo 2-1 Cuhz‼️
2-1 cinco
Best boxing fight i've seen in a while, good on you both!
Happy yall made up..
Deshea got robbed...
About a tie but Jay did good while not having as much boxing experience as Deshae but I'll say Deshae needs to work on being more focused that throwing heavy punches gone tire him out quickly and he coulda been finished right there But they honestly was getting sone blows on each other Jay had more advantage the first round tho.
I came to see cinco perspective view …L camera man missed all the intense hits lol
You know this nigga really from da hood he can throw them hands🤣🤣 go and watch deshae first match again ddg nd compare it with Cinco first match
1st ever time in the ring should I keep going?❤️🙏🏽
After watching this one I think it was right to give the W to cinco. He was makin cleaner contact
y’all wasn’t playing 😳
only time we see Jay Cinco dad in a video and he on the phone the whole time careless asl...
Good shit, ya both did good. Better than the social gloves fight the YouTubers be doing 😭
Deshae frost-tied the snowman po cinco
They both ate, but I’m runnin with Cinco on this one fasho. #W’Cinco💪🏾
L camera man
New camera man
No lie that was a good fight
L camera man😹
I think it’s a draw but you have give to deashe
This is how I seen it: Deshae looked nice because he had more power and aggression Cinco looked nice because he seems to have more of a natural skill ( if he was to take boxing serious)  All in all honestly, I would say that it could be called a DRAW This is just my opinion🗣️‼️😂
This angle is way better then deshae I see how cinco won
Who the camera man 😭💀
2:39 damnnnn Justin!
I soooooo wish that  this fight was for You and Brooklyn to get back together 😊…. I love Brooklyn so much.
L Camera Man 👎
good shit jay , you did yo shit it was a good fight
With no boxing experience and get a draw i respect that shi my boy
You both did great. I’m so impressed this is your first time. Hopefully all love from now on.
Why fight with ex brother it’s pretty much dumb idea and just waste of time consuming for clout just sayin cinco
Ate all them hits .
A man is known for strength, I respect any man for putting on gloves to fight. I’m glad cinco got to experience this doe, if he continue to he gone be cold hands 🔥
Dub was purposely not gettin them angles when Cinco was fkn Deshae up. Ain’t nobody stupid 😒
❤
Yesssaaaa W
I’m sorry but If u think cinco won u just d riding   Good fight though😂😂😂
Yo why DDG feet look so big? Why he look like he got Shaqs shoes on Lmao 🤣 Damn they not putting any head gear on? 🤦🏽‍♂️ who ever has the camera needs to go home like wtf 🤬
Great fight love and respect to both of you this is one of the greatest fights of all time on this platform no freaking kap amazing performance from You Cinco and Deshae 💯🙏🏼🙌🏽💙 proud of you both amazing beautiful to see did y'all absolutely best
Good fight☄️🔥🔥🔥
This was a good fight I think that you should’ve went for the body more so he can open up at the top like if you was getting him with the body shots then, things would’ve open up for you but love the fight we need more 💯💯like this
It was really a tie
Cinco : Pros- clean hit , fasters , Most punches , Blocks / defense , calm Ring control   Cons: not enough power behind punch  Tired, not trained boxer   Won round 1 & 3  Deshea : pros - Agressive , power shots , trained boxer   Cons: slower , missed most shots , tired , no defense   Won round 2   Cinco won 🔥💯
He did his thing. I hope they can put this behind them now.
Cinco got two rounds but this is what needs to happen when two family members have a issue just box it out and move on! Love the Content! Dub need to box next 😂😂
It was a Tie‼️
Cinco was really ducking all of his punches he fast asf 💯‼️
cinco won ion kare💯🔥🔥
Next draymond green and jordan poole 🤣🤣🤣
No bias, Tie ➡️ 💯 deshae was throwing them
It was a tie jaycinco you really adapted to deshae punches just a lil more body shots next time

On my dead cousin grave L !!! Camera man 😡
Yessir dats how we stand on business
You did good cinco 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
Congratulations Cinco!! I hope you keep training with that trainer on your side! With training, you would go far, salute to both of y’all 🔥🔥
I'm glad you men worked it out, it says alot about both  of your characters and I wish that more young men could come to the understanding of working out indifferences like real men such as yourselves.
Respect to you Justin, not gone lie i was impressed!!
Yessir 🖤
Good shit bro 16 oz is def on the heavy side the 175 pound boxers use 16oz
Good job cinco ❤
Good fight 🔥🔥🔥 the only L is your camera man
Tbh they both one jay Won cause it was reffed like a boxing match so every this counts even if it was pointless, but if it wasn’t reffed like that dash would have won cause of his combos and strength.
Cinco take boxing seriously you’ll be a beast!!!!!!
Hn cinco won ‼️
I agree that Deshae cant box like he say he can he rush crazy that’s the only way he will get you so Jay Cinco all the way hands down you did yo shi Jay n for it to b your first time ever putting them boxing gloves on respect 💯
at the end of the day cinco and deshae got my respect all the way no matter what both yall got my respect like a mf and cinco i think you should start really taking dis boxing shit more serious u have alot of potential fasho
Start boxing jay
Cinco if you had more power😧 at 9:29 it would have been lights out for deshae, get consistent in the gym g 💯
I like how they both made up and calmed down at the end🙏🏽👌🏾
You lost this one but thats cool there can always be a round 2 get it the gym and practice build up your muscle gain. You still ate them punches tho you got stamina just gotta get more boxing experience and build muscle
If Cinco would take it serious and stop smoking he can actually be a good boxer he has the street fighter style right tough but has potential to be really good has good reach and quickness defense can be a little better
JAY TOOK THAT WIN
Never Doubted You My Boy. Another Win For The Good Guys.
Pls tell me who y’all win deshae or jay cinco 🤯🤯🤯
JAY WON FOR SURE HES GOOD AT FIGHTING
If u look at deshae angle on his vid Cinco gotchu wit dat stunned at 17:18 dats what got him the fight if he would’ve kept goin he would’ve had him knock out he let him rest he ain’t wanna do em dat bad
Y’all got issue in good ass fight to both of y’all 💯💯
Boxing is an art, it’s not all about power, Cinco threw and landed more. Thus he won, deshea threw a few too but definitely a cinco W.
SORRY about my trolling but nobody won it was a DRAW, BOTH parties did they shit, RESPECT💯

Nah Deshae.. That was a CLEAR loss. Threw mad misses and got hit with way too many clean shots.
Great job to both of you 👏🏾
J definitely won that fight.. if you know anything about boxing then you know all deshae was doing was jumping into him pushing his weight on him and throwing power punches. Crazy thing is j don't even box or train lmao deshae box and trains... He would have hurt Deshea in a street fight that's facts
Respect show deshae u ain’t playing no games about your respect he better come correct
L
good fight Justin! he did get you a good one when you fell back into the red corner.  but it makes you even stronger for getting back up like nothin amd keep on going and winning 💪 🙌 👌 👏 💯 😉 💪  your a beast for swallowing those punches . the camera man was boo-boo ! other then that I would love to see you host a boxing match on the streets  that would be dope 👌
When it comes to technique cinco over deshae deshae just got strength and just swing hoping it hits the person and everybody i seen ever fight deshae  never blocks except ddg 😂
Deshae needed that L. Humble a nigga. You wouldn’t hear the end of it if he woulda won. But you on the other hand didn’t even talk shit or nothing 💯 real man
