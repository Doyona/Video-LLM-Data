Crazy knowing what we know now how this was an Indicator of what’s to come
Dude first second of the game right after jump ball - Bronny possibly but for sure came close to making a bone headed turnover. Maybe by the last second jump from the player he passed saved it from being a turnover. But if ur not having ur way with players ur age in tournaments like this / no way in hell should you be drafted the following year. He's not ready and that's OK. His dad needs to let him make at least some decisions in his life. It's not going to end well with Bronny. Done by the age of 22-23yr old.   There are kids younger who play pick up ball at my community center that would give Bronny smoke one on one. Bronny has to work on his half court game and learn how to move without the Ball...
So much bad defense by strive but the 9:55 mark takes the cake. I watched with the sound off and had to replay it with it on because I thought there was a whistle or something. It looks like a bunch of guys who never seriously practiced together.
Who’s here after they played in the summer league ? 😅
Reed still kickin’ Bronnys @$$ TILL THIS DAY
Sheppard >>>>>>>>Bronny
Dam Reed a dawg. Glad Houston picked him up. He will be a great PG in a couple years.
Playing with masks on? 😂 someone gotta be fired or jailed for this shit down the road eventually 😂
the matchup we getting for game 1 of summer league 🔥super pumped for it!
At one point the commentator said "The passing vision of this Midwest group is on point." I agree. But that stops short of telling the full story.   The desire and willingness of this Midwest team to pass is ON POINT! I completely agree with his later statement, "College teams should take note of the Midwest passing."  Talent without a desire to make the best play for the team is so often lost today. Analytics drive thinking and coaching. A player doesn't have to know what analytics determine is the best play. He can see it before it happens.
That steal @3:50 is the EXACT replica of the steal last night at Miss State
LaCrybaby Jr ain’t got ANY business being mentioned in same breath as Reed Shepard! Reed.S is a legit player & Bronny is Lebrons son… that’s it! Plain & simple!
Bronny not even a top 100 guy
Reed so much better
it’s crazy to think it’s a year later and Reed Shepherd is way more important to his team.
Great...another James shoved down our throats.  Gettin old...
Midwest basketball for u
Reed Sheppard is the best fundamental old school chest passinng prospect since Jason Kidd
A Team with chemistry is the secret to success in today’s basketball world.
He came to our school laurel County
How is noone talking about Reed Shepherd's defense? Watch it back. He had around 8 steals.
There was more back door buckets than a porno.
Reed shepherd going to Kentucky university
He going to Kentucky
Can't play with Shepard
Reed Sheppard will do BIG thing for BIG BLUE!!!! BBN
Sfg didn't have a shot they got ran out the gym from tip off they were out gunned early
I see why big jah isn't ranked he does not put his all into it if you ask me he should be dominant but he ain't trying no one should be pushing him around he plays lazy to me
Where tf is the defense? Bronny just standing there letting players get open lay ups . Getting blown by . But he’s number 39?? Hell nah .. his name is the reason he is ranked so high .. the centers for strive didn’t shuffle their feet , not looking for the ball , guards aren’t getting back on defense after a miss or score . The entire team was walking on defense .. I couldn’t hear strive communication but I was able to hear Midwest screaming at eachother . Calling screens etc .. coaching has to do better .. I understand that they are talented but that doesn’t mean bullshit until the game is damn near over .. btw I have nothing but high hopes for bronny . Just in case anyone thought I was hating 😁
Yeahh RAYVON😂🐐🔥🔥💯💯💯💯 5️⃣1️⃣3️⃣ Representing Our City NIGGA
No comparison in talent levels from 12:05 compared to 12:12   GO BBN!
Reed Sheppard's coaching staff built different. Should've given them some camera time.
one team playing Amazing team ball against a bunch of 1v1 players.
I can't be the only one that thinks Lebrons kid is one of the lesser players out there? Bunch of the other kids were out skilling and out hustling him
The worst defense I’ve ever seen in my life…..
76-63 "2nd" LOL OK
Loved watching this Midwest team. Playing team ball not alot of iso
Bruh SFG got no chemistry all iso plays and no hustle…
Midwest got hot from 3 and a early league smh
Is it me, or does Bronny team look him off a lot? I feel like he’s open a lot, but nobody wants to pass him the ball
Sfg defense was so sloppy
Midwest played with fundamentals, the coach is doin a good job with those guys
Midwest know how to move tht mfn ball
I see they don't want to pass to Bronny best shooter on the team
Omg
Num 2 nd 3 ball hogs
this the warriors??
This gotta be the worst defense I’ve seen in a min
reeeeeeeeeeddddddddd vs broniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii was a great game cant wait to see them both play on the next level ...but reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeddddddddddd   is something dangerous
Them LA teams don’t look so good when they face competition from other outer state teams.
sheperd way better than brony
brony got-schooled
Bronny James got ZERO takeover
WOW  THE MID REPPING   WE GOT HOOPERS FR
Bronny is always the most petite guy on the court. I don't think he is 6ft tall. ..he is tiny.
reed has one and done potential
Jah just isn’t good he’s just big so uncoordinated and no skills to make up for that lack of athleticism
The Midwest coach needs a college or nba job asap!!!  The kid from Midwest was BALLING!!!!
THE REAL N.B.A. TRUTH...  This is a question for Draymond Green that I know he will not answer. I just saw a video of him talking about how a group of children were so lucky to get the chance to be around LeBron James. That made me think about how ungrateful N.B.A. players have become and all the problems you all bring to this sport when you're all not even close to being as good as past players. None of you are. The only reason you all get off like you do is because none of you know how to defend one on one and none of you have coaches that actually teaches team defense.  It's easy for Steph Curry to jack up 300 3-pointers in this gimmick ball league you all play in, but if you remember back in outside pick-up games, they would have trap him and fast break him right off the court. The league is straight trash, and the players are straight trash and that's why nobody responded to me when I said I could go to New York Rucker's Park and hand pick 13 guys and in about one week in a real half a game scrimmage beat your worst team in the N.B.A.  In about a month I could have them beat every team in the N.B.A. just off of basic fundamentals and actually making players pay a price for jacking up bad shots which is the biggest part of basketball and that the N.B.A. have completely thrown away. The league is a complete scam and the W.N.B.A. women play 100x harder than the N.B.A. best players and it's sad and embarrassing to say the least.                                                                                GRIM
Bronny has a bunch of “me, me, me” teammates playing hero ball and not passing.
College teams need to watch this footage. Amazing passing and team play.
Poor defense by strive
The Strive team was simply outclassed, outhussled and outplayed by the Midwest. Strive had no ball movement, no plan of attack on offense and not a lot of defense. As talented as the Strive guys are, the basic fundamentals of basketball must be adhered to or you will lose every time.
Damn who is the coach at Midwest that was impressive how they where pushing that ball.
thumbnail doing bronny dirty 😂
Greatness?lmfao this wannabe isnt even one of the top 100 players in the country
SFG is poorly coached that’s all. The Midwest team is well coached and have some straight up ballers.
SFG Needa get some players that actually like playing defense 😂
Sfg was embarrassing
Crazy how no big media outlets wanna post this one😂 but they always post all of bronnys games
Midwest got real snipers
reed is a phenomenal basketball player
Most of Strive for greatest players are trash only play iso and no defense. I’d deadass make bronny run the show more often he’s just standing in the corner while his guys try to be cool and sh*t
strive for "no defense" is what they should be called
You'll only become better playing a better opponent, bronny good look who his father is but there never was an I in team
idk what sfg was doing or thinking in the first minutes of the 1st half 🤣
"bronny has very high iq and plays great defence" 9:57
Nah sfg really recruited and was still trash asf😭😭😭😭
Strive for a stop, wtf?? No hustle or heart on D till they're down double digits. This Midwest team was more fun to watch than the Big 12!  It was like watching the 86 Celts vs. AND1 schematically.
Midwest out there lookin like the 86 Celtics. Skill and smart basketball embarrassing athleticism.
Was not too impressed with Bronny James. Yates and Sheppard stood out from deep tho overall Sheppard appears more polished early on. Can't remember the tall kid who had 15 at the end of the first half for Midwest but I liked his overall game too. Nice game. Well played by both teams. Good sportsmanship.
SFG has a really bad coaching. No plays run. All iso
SFG head coach has no fadumentals or knows how to use his team. Even a guy can knock up 30 points and still lose this game
I'm saying this affectionately so don't clobber me lol plus I am clueless mainly about basketball lol but as soon as I saw Bronny in the thumbnail pic and title I thought his opponent better watch out bc imho and my spazzy mind, Bronny's name sounds exactly like Brawny and my feeble domestic-oriented marbles picture  athlete Bronny can loosen up with laughs during his regimented sports life & he can always be rest assured that he has that vintage man on the papertowels/shop towels Brawny mascot rootin' for him! Lol 🙃 🏀 ⚘️
John 6:35 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.
JAMES IS DEF.... NOT A TOP 100 PLAYER......
DADDDYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
You can't win against a team unless you are actually a team and not just full of stars you gotta play together and swing the ball 🤷🏿‍♂️🔥
Yo whos coaching strive lmao. So many instances of no box out or ball watching resulting in free cuts.
this some of the best team basket ball i ever saw this team is high level mid west yall play winnin bwsketball make me want to cry
Seeing Jah Jackson ballon up is sad this year and he is not a 7 footer.
Don’t want to watch the whole 10 minute clip to find Bronny scored a few points.  I tried to look up Bronny’s stat for this game and wasn’t able to.  Anybody got Bronny’s line from this game so we could chew him out. Bronny is average.
They broke that zone apart
High school basketball in Kentucky, specifically South eastern KY is so underrated
Chemistry vs zero chemistry.
You can tell SFG doesn’t play with each other. Their defense is poopie
Even in AAU. Team ball beats ME ball. SFG need to find some offensive sets and Quick!!
Relax peoples,   it just a pick up games.  No one playing beyond real hard.    Heeeee more talent 👏..
brony, your coach really got to understand how importand and determine is the diffent  and the team move and keep working on it. your team was absolutly loss in the entire game no diffent at all, no matter how many points you guys make if you cant stop other team from making points then u aint doint nothing. more team organization and hard work on the diffent  and less indivual plays
prime example of a team full of talent cant beat a team with ball movement, shootin  and spacing
Wish i could invest in brook cupps stock right now, he's gonna get a paycheck one day in which he deserves
I didn’t know the warriors had a AAU team
It hurts to watch this when they keep letting Midwest cut to the basket everytime and they do nothing about it 💀
Midwest didn't waste any time playing in this match up and you can tell the chemistry those guys have is something special. The entire game I saw great ball movement, lethal shooters, and backdoor cuts to the rim. Remarkable coaching as well.
Bronny play like shit
So what is the SFG coach teaching them? High ball screen? Pitiful coaching, he must think they are NBA pros.
shepherd years ahead of bronny so obvious
Midwest beat SFG with fundamental basketball.
Strives defense is terrible
This ain’t SFG regular team Mackenzie Mgbako plays for NJ Scholars and Rob Dilligham plays for Team CP3. And Jah hasn’t been playing with SFG all summer.  They literally threw this team together
I’m mad they acted like rob wasn’t there 🤦🏽‍♂️🥴🤦🏽‍♂️🥴🤦🏽‍♂️🥴🤦🏽‍♂️🥴
Kentucky is about to have a legendary next 3 years.
Mark my words, reed Shepard is gonna be a NPOTY candidate once he gets into college. 💯 That kids IQ is crazy. An his dad was a star at KY in the 90s.
i love this type of basketball movement. thats how we play and i coach. most players dont no how to guard all them back door cuts  and screen rolls. that kill teams all day long.
This game was better than a regular NBA game. This is the type of games I can fly to watch! Midwest plays beautiful game
Sfg PLAYED NOOOO DEFENSE! N didn’t pass it looked BAD! Midwest WHOOP THAT ASS!
This was a PRIME EXAMPLE what TEAM PLAY can do for you, yeah SFG had more talented players overall, but Midwest moved without the ball...passed the ball... and ran plays.  SFG basically played pickup up game, no plays no sets, just let me dice this dude up and try and get a bucket. People standing on the perimeter crowding the ball trying to get it and not moving, falling asleep off the ball, it was a rough game for SFG, someone caught that KJ Martin (Keyon son, Sierra Canyon alum) was cursing the head coach out too😳😳
Stive isn't a very good and cohesive team. This shows that shooting and BBIQ at lower levels trumps athleticism and pedigree. Good lesson to learn for Bronny and company
chill on sfg they all just played at peach jam
Reed lookin like Stockton out that Jawn lol nice on both ends of the floor
Changed that title I see
Them boys got trashed lol
The thing about Strive they are offensive weapons still yet to fully learn the defensive game. It showed
Team ball will always best this isolation bs
Sad
Bronny not playing in the NBA.
Midwest is the Golden State of AAU lol
It's always the same, when ur young the really athletic teams (mostly black) lose to a more fundamentally sound less athletic team bcus they get out coached. It evens out in college tho
Puis on me dira que bronny est le fils de LeBron arrêtez moi ça il ne mérite même pas.
What was Bronnys stats?
Wasn’t Rob just on the CP3 team?
Can Coach Cal please pick up offensive sets from the Midwest Basketball Club. That is how modern basketball suppose to be played, especially with Reed Sheppard
Bro SFG jus made me mad asl, all they had to do was talk out switches on defense to stop all those wide open layups off cuts, horrible coaching…definitely looked like a team that jus got put together, no excuse tho because defense is all effort and they looked they didn’t want to be there!
I’m not normally a hater, but i don’t understand why lebron allows Bronny to stay on this bum ass team😂 Blue chips would never! But, this MW team is actually OD
Reed is the best player on the floor. Should be top 5 in the class.
This is gonna make for a great JxmyHighroller video in 6 years
Lol This was pretty bad .. The defense 😆😆😆 wtf
Discipline beats talent when talent doesn’t have discipline…
This is a good example that kids need to also learn to play defense. Everyone say Bronny is not a good player . But he really is no he didn’t score 20 30 pts but he can play defense and a good floor general. That’s what win games not all this iso ball all the time. Bronny will do well in college.
SVG didnt have a great game but really impressed by #3 Yates. Played unselfish and has a good feel for the game
Sfg play shitty ass defence
This is a textbook example of a fundamental team vs a team that plays iso ball. So crazy to watch
Defense wins games
SFG GOT OUT COACHED
The Ohio team just looked more composed and had higher energy. And #2 was sharp; right place right time, but consistently, meaning he was working at it.
Who tf is coaching SFG. Why did they make #2 run the point? He has negative basketball IQ. Dude over-dribbles so many times. Literally runs into double teams. Celebrates made shots when being down by 20. Over-exaggerates no-look passes, to compensate for his terrible court vision. The guy is apparently ranked #5 in the nation, but plays like he's on something. I bet he's talented and can score the lights out, but anyone with a brain would never let him run point. Coach is a crackhead.
Reed has got to be given a higher rank after this right?????
number 2 for SFG is trash. How is he the point guard over Bronny with negative BBIQ.
Who’s the coach for SFG they need to be fired keeping them in that Bullshit u call a zone not being on they ass for getting back on defense. ball hogging, just outright BAD BASKETBALL THIS IS DISGUSTING
I like fundamental sound guys like Midwest. Uk been lacking the recruits
Bronny still not showing me anything smh
Jah Jackson is so bad for a big not athletic and isn’t as skilled yet.
SFG looking for their shots instead of team basketball. These dudes was slicing them up. They never made an effort to get out to the shooters
midwest playing style is like the Warriors
Midwest is a TEAM, "Strive for Greatness" is a bunch of dudes trying to get theirs.
U take a bunch of guy that never played together or barely and try to win just because they top rank or big name against an other team with rank player that played together for a long time ur not gunna win
0 and 3 for SFG should have been on the bench for the lack of defensive effort they gave. If you wanna look cool on defense look cool on the bench
Bronny's a team player! Very humble kid!!!. He NEVER steps on the court with an "it's my team" attitude! Wondering if picked Rob as his backcourt partner bc he's considering Kentucky.  He should be top 20
Reed is a VERY GOOD passer
It’s clear that SFG is the more talented team on paper but that Midwest team is coached very well and those guys play their roles at an elite level. SFG forgot to play defense all game & played ISO ball making so easy for the Midwest guys to defend & I won’t even talk about the transition buckets they gave up.   I do believe if they would run it back I got SFG winning. They took that Midwest team for granted from the start of the game and them boys got they assses spanked 🤣 PAUSE
Bronny James is not better than his father at the high school level and will not be better than his father at the pro level as well…he doesn’t have to fight for anything he was born with everything #The Truth #BornWithNoStruggles 💯🤷🏻‍♂️
12:23 No defensive awareness 😭
Reed Shepherd looked Like a top 5 player n the nation,,Cuz He isn't Flashy They have him Ranked to Low
What is number 1 doing here??? 12:21
SFG needs to play as a team more and have some awareness on defense
7:08 Nahhh, that shooting form is suspect 👀
tht reed dude is gonna be smt else in college
FIRST OFF: SFG looks horrible and faced a really good fundamental team so they looked like they’ve never been there before .   SECOND OFF: Bronny teammates looked over him every-time. Did not want to pass him the ball
That was like a kentucky vs princeton simulation…….the amount of back cuts that sfg got exposed on was crazy. That was just pure lackadaisicalness and reliance on athleticism to recover. These high ranking please may want to present some defensive awareness. Otherwise, they’ll get exposed even more at the next level and start crying about playin time. Lord knows, if you dont defend, college coaches will not keep you on the floor………unless, you’re blessed with kd/step/kyrie type offensive ability
the score difference was between 11 to 13 points throughout the game. If not for the score I would’ve thought this was a blowout victory for Midwest. If sfg could play real defense they could’ve won, like 2-3 zone or sum.
Gabe cupps dad is a really good coach, his high school team made it to the state final two years in a row (one of which they won)and play a great brand of basketball. Won’t be surprised to see him coach on the college level after gabe graduates
SFG need to focus on Defense and rebounding!!!  Play team ball!!  Embarrassing to watch
It's obvious that one team plays together on a regular, as the other is sort of thrown together talents.    Chemistry beats talent any day.
Rayvon Griffith should definitely move to top 20. Dude has sooo much potential it’s crazy!
That's what the Midwest do!!!! We are prime scorers and always know how to shoot and move the basketball. We are not always the tallest coming out of this side but when it comes to offense and heart we will always be one of the best!
Y’all gotta remember AAU from team basketball Midwest just came out turnt up n hungry
9:57 what did I just watch 😂🤦🏾‍♂️
It look like the James family are not made for super team. Damm four players in the top 50 and lose the game like that.
Just Fundamentals. Bad Defense, ball watching, no help defense. Them kids better get it together before hitting college. Midwest just moved without the ball, took good shots, played team defense.  All in all, 9 times out of 10, SFG wins.
It is AAU tho 🤷🏿‍♂️
Idk why rob and cook ain’t talk SFG like they don’t play around 5-stars all the time knowing iso ball ain’t gon win games 🤦🏿‍♂️😭
That #34 kid on SFG is terrible, horrible work ethic...yawning before tip off come on man. These kids are way too privileged now days I tell you.
Real Basketball always wins
Its crazy how the superteam filled with top players get beaten by the team with ONE ranked player and an organized system and good chemistry.  Edit: thanks y’all for reminding me about the  other ranked players but SVG still has way more talent than midwest I was talking about how talent dont just win anything but organisation and chemistry
Midwest plays better than most NBA teams.
Why is it that the Caucasians always have a high IQ, and the Melanated is always Highly Athletic, always these subtle mind games in when it comes to sports....
why this nigga Rob Dillingham look like Playboi Carti folks? and Reed seems to be legit
I never seen such young ballers as a team move with out the ball this well, all have great vision and passing to get the ball to an opened player anddd they all got a strap from 3 .. tuff 🔥
Jogging for Greatness
Your better than this son come on
Bronny only #39? He ain’t making the league
NO.2 and NO.0  is crazily noob. get those 2 lazy bugs off the court plz. strive teams did a lazy jobs on passing balls and def
All these new niggas on SFG play NO defense
they need to push the hs three line back because wtf bruh
This is auu boys, they are there for fun
That game had me screaming at my tv all night🤦🏾‍♂️  1. Too much iso for SFG. Looked like they was playing 5v5 at the park and everyone was playing too selfish. No coaching or offensive/defensive sets or plays 2. Midwest was face cutting on em all night and that motion offense had SFG in a blender. They came to play and had more heart🤷🏾‍♂️ 3. Midwest moved the ball faster and more efficient and it never stuck to one person. Constant movement.  4. Chemistry/Teamwork kills always 5. Hard work outworking the talent. No one on SFG tried on defense
Kids don't play HS basketball 🏀 anymore?
Bronnny moved to #39 🔥 dude has been cooking lately
Good to see Reed get some national exposure.....cant wait to see him at UK in 2023.....star of the game..
This is embarrassing to watch. No i.q no brains or effort for strive lmfao wow. Total ass whooping
Man that Midwest teams fun to watch…couple dribbles, give it up, and don’t stop moving…love it!
Bronny ain't all that lol u can see he's all brand and name just a average player.
Same fans that makes excuses for Bron losing are going to be the same ones making excuses for bronny?
Bronny on the wrong team he a mid west baby🤦🏾‍♂️ that team his on was trash selfish as hell no defense in and outta the paint let everybody get straight to the store and get free shit! But that mid west team was ballin look like the baby GSW out there!
SFG was playing at all star game intensity. Energy only used for offense lol

Midwest was unselfish and just clicking on all cylinders
One team played with energy and as a team the other team played selfish and hero ball
Live by the 3 die by the 3. Midwest was hungry for the win, SFG played too unorthodox early on
The crazy shit about all of this is if bron stayed in Cleveland Bronny would’ve been balling with them 🤯
One team been playing together for 3year the other team been playing together for 3days
Jesus Christ is returning soon! Are you saved? Romans 3:23, 6:23, 10:9-10 Plz wake up?
The mentality of the teams are totally different. You got one squad who’s too cool for school and worried about how they look, and you have another team who wins off hard work, playing together and playing smart. All that damn talent and their mindsets are God awful. This generation needs to improve especially when you have a talented group like SFG
"Strive for lockdown defense"
Looked like a team that been together for a while and a team that came together a few days ago
Defence ain’t there for SFG
