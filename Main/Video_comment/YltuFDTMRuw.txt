Corum’s touchdown at 17 points to bring Michigan to 24 looked almost identical to the rose bowl OT touchdown
Please keep Gus Johnson on the network, good energy!!!!  👍🏽
Mccord sold😂
That roman wilson td wasnt a td. and if they didnt rig the game in shitigans favor we win it
One call made the difference. Denzel Burke had that ripped out of Wilson’s hands. That call goes their way and they win.
I knew we were going to win the natty when corum did 6. 5. I knew at that moment nothing was stopping this team
Let this remind us of how Clemson typically overwhelms Ohio State in football
I feel like Ohio got juiced out if a CFP spot!!!
We have three top receivers and a way better quarterback and coach.  And we be the UNDERDAWGS.
Bring the natty home Michigan! From an osu fan!
Michigan cheated and still are allowed in playoffs
Still watching on New Year’s Day. GO BLUE BEAT BAMA
Michigan ain’t ready for Bama
And this literally ended mccord’s time at osu
32 seconds, no timeouts, need a TD to win, and you attempt to throw the ball down the center of the field? Were you paid my guy???
Tom gets to keep his ring
All so they can get trampled by Bama in the CFP, OSU wasn’t as strong this year, and last year TCU Smdefeated them. Bama isn’t a BIG10 team. Bama has the big maulers at the line of scrimmage and an explosive offense,   Michigan will have never faced this before. Bama gonna win by double digits
This game could’ve went either way. Michigan’s last drive eating up so much clock was huge.  Bucks fought hard but even if Harrison completed that pass there was only 24 seconds left.
Love it!
Alabama is gonna smoke these fools. So is Texas. No shot
Go Blue! 〽️〽️〽️
As an Alabama fan I’m so excited to see two college football giants facing off in the Rose Bowl. It’s gonna be a great game. As a college football fan you can’t ask for more than that. Roll Tide!!!
I wouldn't be surprised if Harrison Jr. Is the #1 pick in the 2024 draft
more sign stealing most likely. the wolverines should have been disqualified from playing anymore games after being caught cheating.
The last time Ohio state  had qb  play well in the NFL was tom tupa and he switched to punter 😂😂😂
Easy when you are cheater and stealing other teams information. Not impressed. Cheat-baugh should be fired.
I have watched this so many times haha Corum holding up the 65 shows how close this team is
Mccords throwing some darts out there. Hate to see him taking so much flack, he’ll have his day
The guy commenting is elite
I'm an SEC fan and alum ... and the only game I want to see is "The Game", Ohio State vs. Michigan.  I'll gladly watch Alabama vs. Georgia.  But the channel stays on The Game and I'll bite your hand if you reach for the remote. No joke. 😋
I didn’t watch the game, but man just watching this was exciting!!! Congrats Michigan
OSU can't even win when UM has no coach
Let amateur highlight channels live you cowards
This entire video is either scoring plays or turnovers… other than two Marvin Harrison Jr. catches.  Seems kind of odd.  The guy is good but there were more impactful plays for both teams.  Especially the first catch they show here.  BTN bias.
McCord has a man but 2:50 He plays for the other team
I didn't realize till later he dropped the interception.
2:48 that play is going to be in hype packages for this game for years
Its just too funny. OSU cant find a way to win the only team they play all year so they get michigans coach kicked out................and still lose.  Now comes the part where they start trying to cry their way into another playoff they have no business even being in the discussion over.  Cant make this garbage up............somehow pulled ahead of georgia a few weeks ago by struggling with Rutgers. The bias and entitlement is sickening. Enjoyed this game so much at the local olive garden that they almost kicked me out.
Congrats Michigan, you’ve cheated stealing signs for the last year or so and put the icing on the cake here. Classic dirty Michigan football
1:20 authors in the Stone Age
As an Ohio state fan I am going to to be making excuses why they should have won for the next 2 weeks.
Went to this game for my first game ever live. What an experience. The hype was insane.
OSU Was Sloppy.
Gus Johnson can Fook Off!  Michigan hater!  Can’t listen to him call this game.
For somebody tht didn’t watch the game live these highlights are horrible and whoever makes them lazy asf
I left the game with 1:05, I just did not want to deal with a lot of people leaving the stadium. Go Blue!
It’s sad that Ohio state fans calling day overrated for losing to Michigan again. I don’t get this game was not a blowout it was very close could’ve gone either way. That’s the way the rivalry is a team wins 3’ 4’5’ games in a row . Mcord played good aswell except the picks that ultimately proved pivotal
Looking back, I'm surprised it was close. You could almost make the case that we haven't played anybody, still
Finally the big house sounded like A BIG HOUSE.  Good job Michigan engineers.
Go Blue!!!
I'm a Buckeye fan but let's face it. In this game, you can't throw 2 interceptions!! Or any. It cost us and hope. And McCarthy on Michigan as I mentioned to my friends, was going to be the key to stop. And we couldn't do it.
GO BLUE!!! 💙💛
Go Michigan beat the Crybabies.... 2024 will be 4 in a row !
Michigan should have been disqualified from the season after the play stealing.
Michigan vs Iowa lol
Osu losing is always awesome
Won't be watching Marv in the nfl after that
GO BLUE
In 2021 Michigan ran all over OSUs defense so OSU hired Jim Knowles from Okl St. Knowles defense last year gave up 5 TDs over 45 yards from commiting to many resources to stopping the run.  This year they brought more of a bend but don't break defense thus Michigan gladly bled OSU out slowly over 4 quarters.  After Michigan went 3 and out twice to open the game the in game adjustments took place....  Michigan scored on 6 of last 7 possessions.   Ohio State has not forced Michigan to punt in the 2nd half during this 3 game losing streak.
What happens if Cheat-i-gan loses games due to cheating scandal?😂
Only in Ohio💀
Was just in the stadium watching this live. Greatest game I’ve ever watched live. Most fun I’ve ever had
How poetic marvs college career ended in michigan and his pro career will begin in michigan
At the end of the day, Thee better team won🤷‍♂️
Congrats to Michigan
Camron had me thinking they had a chance forreal
I was there! They played sweet victory from SpongeBob at the end. Was a great day to be a Wolverine.
buckeye fan here 🌰🍀  not a bad game, js if we had a better qb that could throw and make big plays, and a coach who can make better play calls we could maybe have won this game and not have lost 3 years in a row! but congratulations ❌ichigan you deserve it, truly.
HOW SWEET IT IS/Victory!!!
The committee will do everything possible to get Ohio State into the playoff. Like last year when Ohio State sat at home, rested, and relaxed while the other teams played in Conference Title Games.
"The cheaters and the Best"
For the sign-stealers, the refs gave them the breaks when they needed it…McCord could’ve played better and Ryan Day needs to go before next season, but that TD the refs gave the Cheaters instead of calling it the INT it actually was, changed the game…top for teams SHOULD be Georgia, Oklahoma, Florida State and Oregon…we don’t want ref-assisted teams like Michigan and the Huskies anywhere near the top, plus Michigan shoulda been banned from top four anyway…as it is in its current format, the NCAA got what it wanted this season…smh
I’m a DIE HARD Buckeye fan and I HATE THE QB AND FIRE DAY ASAP
Time to go back to the drawing board Ohio !
Glad the Wolverines won vut also love to see Marvin Harrison Jr had a great game too
Give thought to hiring adults to call the game.  These hyper 8 or 9-year olds, likely now incontinent, are neither entertaining nor usefully informative.  Worse, they are so unaware as to not comprehend what should be self-evident embarrassment.
1457 days and counting…📈📈📈
We not gonna talk about how ryan day was outcoached by Sherrone Moore???
Energyyyyyyy
Both of my sons will play for Morgan State University.
I proved on several different occasions how athletic I am. I did well on the basketball court and football field. The freemasons have used every tool available to convince people I'm not athletic.
I am very disappointed that Ohio State didn’t recreate tearing the Michigan sign down after it happened 50 years ago😂
Ohio state should no longer refer to us as “ttun”. They may now call us “Daddy”
Gus said Kyle Stover 💀
Had to work yesterday, didn’t get to watch. These highlights are so short. Fox won’t show a replay. Anyone know where I can find a free site to watch the replay?
Time for Ohio State to find a new head coach that can beat Michigan every year not lose to them SMH 🤦🏻💯
I used to like Gus Johnson as an announcer, not so much anymore.
Michigan OWNS the world. Michigan above all. Best team ever. GO BLUE
You might as well put Michigan in the NFL. They are that good. You hate on us, we get stronger! MICHIGAN VERSUS THE WORLD!!!!!!! GO BLUE!
that td to roman wilson should have not been counted, sad to see that not only does michigan steal signs but they pay off refs too
As a Penn State fan, Michigan needs to beat Georgia and take it all home this year
*What a game!!*
i’m happy we could keep marvin under wraps (yes im celebrating 5 catches 118 yards and a touchdown)
When we had dual threats like JT,Cardale and Fields they didn’t have no answers for it.
OSU needs a dual threat QB that can use his legs when they need it on a important drive.Look what JJ did when they needed to put a drive together
Clemson fan here Marvin Harrison jr should just go to the nfl draft he done so much for Ohio state last year it’s no question in my mind they would of blew TCU out for the championship they outplayed Georgia the whole game outside 40 seconds which cost them the game
How is crying ryan
Gus Johnson the greatest play-by-play announcer
BET Team 144 〽️
GO BLUE. Most hated team in the country but WE DON’T CARE. It’s so funny seeing all the haters salty that Michigan won. This is 3 in a row. We OWN osu. Michigan vs EVERYBODY GO BLUE FOREVER 〽️
I saw several games yesterday that looked rigged, and this was one of them!
Michigan-Ohio State is the best rivalry in college football, period end of story.
That first interception by Will Johnson is Marvin Harrison Jr's fault, not Kyle McCord.  Harrison is so super talented, but he is a lazy premadonna on the field some times and it cost OSU big time their.
That was a close one. But we pulled it out. And now Jimmy’s suspension is over.
No big safety hit in the 3rd?
Has James turner missed a fig all season?  He’s money.
Harrison’s soft play was the reason for the first Int, not McCord.
Game was rigged.
Gus Johnson needs to be stopped, he renders the broadcast unwatchable! He makes so many mistakes calling the play by play and then uses his nauseating catch phases to try snd cover it up. Get better Fox
Buckeyes,  "1001 wins?  How gaudy!  Who does that?"
Michigan was the better team this year. I didn't expect we would win. I was surprised we were favored or ranked higher. We had close games all year. On another note, in some ways its good to have the rivalry back. I was starting to think of Michigan as just another Iowa or Wisconsin these last 20 years...some years didn't bother even watching cuz we were killing them every year....16-4 over the last 20 years. So it looks like rivalry is renewed. Time to look at Ryan Day if he fucks up and loses again next year at home.
Down goes ohio😂
❤
As a non partisan fan I gotta say this game was ruined by the BS TD on the ball that was never possessed by Mich WR , on what planet can u not control a ball for less than a sec and still get a TD out of it , redic call shoulda been overturned ,
More execution you got a GOAT Michigan. Just run away. You gotta break your code. 😏  Classy every year. And never poor and hungry looking. Bold...
McCord CHOKED
Gus is the worst announcer,  you can tell he was for Michigan.
To all the commenter thank you for the good sportsmanship and praise for two great teams leaving it all on the field. Ohio St. you are a great team and the rivalry is back. I dread next year you are going to be even tougher.
This is why you don't rank ohio state over Michigan lol just don't. They're not gonna beat em. They will always find a way to not win the big 10😂
Listen to the difference in vocal ton when ohio scores vs when Michigan scores.  Could they at least pretend to be objective a little better? 🙄😏
We beat Ohio and the big ten today 💯 😘
That was an interception
Gus has got to be the worst Ohio statE fan ever
Maserati Marv and Honda McCord ran outta gas today. Go Blue!! 〽️
The Michigan always The best 🎉
Ohio did all that talking
I was a good half an hour away from Ann Arbor and when that interception at 2:44, I could just feel how loud that stadium got
Wonder how many signs Michigan stole this game?
Good luck Coach Day at Texas A&M next season
I got tired of Gus Johnson talking about the great Ohio State players, with no regard for any of the Michigan players. At least try to be neutral! Anyway, great game!
The Scioto River will flood with all those tears from Columbus!
Refs got michigan that dub
We do know that there have NEVER been Wolverines in the state of Michigan. What up? But, who do they beat next?
"3 minutes and 14 seconds.  That's all you get, slave. You're welcome." B1G
Ryan Day’s job on the line. Getting beat by the 2nd string coach!
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!  Told ya 💙😒
I hope Texas makes the playoffs so they can play Michigan. That would be awesome.
I was expecting a giant commerical
Do you think Marvin Harrison Jr does A) as good as his dad in the pros; B) worse than his dad in the pros; C) about the same
I think it's safe to say  that the clock is ticking on ryan day's time in columbus.
I don't hear Anyone talking about Michigan coach if it was Anyone else they would be out of a job
Congrats to Xichigan from a true Buckeye fan. Good luck out there because yall just saved us from embarrassing ourselves to Georgia. Yall gonna need all the luck yall can get against them or any SEC team you face. Im not bitter at all i would love to see the Big 10 win it this year.
Ryan having a bad Day 😂😂😂
The commentators need to be muted.  They just yell like it's their big day in the spotlight.
JJ McCarthy was the better quarterback and the defense was awesome. The best defense in the nation.
All it was missing was light snow
Easy
I think its safe to say its time for Michigan to join the SEC!
Ryan Day is 56-7 overall as Ohio State’s coach, with a .889 winning percentage. He is 38-0 against Big Ten teams not named Michigan. He is a wildly successful coach except for one day a year, and it just so happens to be the day that matters most to Buckeye Nation. All the Buckeyes screaming for a new coach, who probably wont be able to match Ryan Day's success.
T9OG LUUK TO MIGHIGAN
The big ten needs to make a rule so you only get one shot at a team for the championship. This game is only special because it's once a year.  The big ten championship game should always feature the top team and the best team that hasn't already played the top team.
This is potentially the greatest college football game ever!
This announcer has the worst sounding voice. It's like he gargles while yelling.
I'm officially having John Cooper flashbacks.😵‍💫
ITS GREAT TO BE A MICHIGAN WOLVERINE
1-3 vs Michigan, FIRE Ryan Day!!!
Did anyone really think Kyle Mccord was going to lead a comeback with his accuracy!!!
Remind me.... which Ohio State player said they "guarantee" a win? Because they watched the film or something.....
When that Michigan defender intercepted that ball with a minute left, you could hear the yells inside houses for blocks here in Ann Arbor.
Go blue 💛💙
That was a good as game of the day for real. Both team gave there all. I cant wait until Michigan beat Georgia for the championship for real. Go Michigan Wolverine for real
Again Ohio State overated..
Harbaugh beat Ohio State from his living room.   Ryan Day is to stupid to change his play signals.  Michigan read him like they knew everything he was doing!
Kyle McCord was the MVP for Michigan this game
I knew the buckeyes were overrated 😂
The miscue in the beggining definitely did em in
They don't even have Harrison's spin move for a first down on here smh
Will Johnson #2 and Blake Corum #2??? how do you get two players on the same team with the same number?
The announcer was so biased to Ohio state the whole game lol barley talked when Michigan had the ball
Cant stand the announcer. Some drunk frat boy?
Nothing better than seeing those long buckeye faces. But dont worry. Theyll find a way to keep you in the playoffs. Just like before.
GO BLUE 💙💛
I was wanting to see will Johnson vs Marvin Harrison I got it and it didn’t disappoint. Top3 matchup people this could’ve been the national championship
Good win big blue let's gooooo
Where’s harbaugh?
as a UM fan, should this game not also be played next week? No disrespect to Iowa but number 2 and 3 should be playing for the Big10 championship. What a game, OSU has nothing to hang their head about.
Can’t wait to see ma$e after that…. lol he might be an expert lol
Looks like the BIG TEN and Ohio State need to conspire and dream up an all new scandal against Michigan.........yeah the current scandal just fell on its face. Karma never misses !!!!!!
Here is my question for the Michigan fans. Ohio State vastly outrecruits michigan, there's no comparison of the quality of the football players between the 2 programs. However, Michigan won 3 straight. How does that work?
What is up buckeye nation?
Cool that Michigan lost their Big man in the Middle, then ran it right down the Buckeyes Throats.....and Corum scores the Big Run TD, and immediately flashes 6, 5 right at the Camera! Michigan Blue Crew is Tight!
Insufferable screaming by gus.  The nicknames are dumb af too.  Blake the great?  Maserati marv?  Just annoying these are just college kids relax.
It's always good to see Anyone beat "the Ohio State University." From an SEC fan.
HAIL HAIL
Go blue
It is all fun and entaintaining to watch these plays but that guy awakenbeerus proved that all of this is rigged just so the big betters can make a lot of money. Have seen it with his own eyes believe me.
Good win Michigan love this college fb team
Michigan is #1
Rushing the field today was something special. Go Blue and see you next week Iowa!
Game of the year!!
How exciting! Go Blue!!!
Great game. If it was played in Ohio it might’ve gone the other way. Glad one of these teams had to lose. Hopefully this puts Alabama in the playoffs where they belong 😁
Tony Pettini is going to be booed into Oblivion next week.
As a wolverines living overseas, so proud, Go Blue!
1:09 Kyle stover
Arguably the biggest sports rivalry in the US, both teams 11-0,  final score of 30-24, and all we get is 3 minutes of highlights?!
Congrats to Michigan from a Michigan fan😂
That JJ thread pass was the best throw I've ever seen in my life!
Congratulations Coach Harbaugh!! I knew would be the guy to take Michigan to the SEC Game.
Maserati Marv. Already a legend.
Im going to miss Blake Corum 😢
Proud of the interm coach
The announcer with the Maserati Marv comment is quite annoying. Congrats to Big Blue on defeating the Buckeyes. Big Ten Championship awaits. Then a number 2, maybe 1 seed in CFP...GO BLUE!!  I am a PSU fan and I love the football played in Ann Arbor...
GO BLUE LETS GO
Hail to the Victory, GO BLUE Ohio Steak on the menu 2nite😊
It's gonna be hilarious when Iowa wins 6-3 next week
Only time in my life ive ever cheered for Michigan....i mean they have a nebreigdo name masarati.
Ohio State fans have been talking mad 💩 for the past week…but I don’t see a single one in the comments.😂 better luck next year boys.
So proud of my boys!!! Go Blue
So it wasn’t the signs? Huh
Third straight Season . Go Blue
it was all in that field goal strategy, that was it
Michigan. Against. Everyone.
It's Official WE ARE IN THE COOPER 2.0 ERA LOL !!!!!!!.If DAY cant beat MICHIGAN next year @ the HORSESHOE HE GOTTA GO !!!!!!!!
Best player on the Michigan team today was Kyle McCord.
***
Excellent Game, *From 2 World Class Universities!*
Stick it NCAA! Wolverines got it done even without Harbaugh! I will say Ohio St has one incredible WR in Marvin Harrison Jr 👍💪
As a buckeye fan congrats to Michigan for winning this incredible football game and for making this rivalry fun to watch.
Gooooo Blue, let the hate rain OSU fans, cya next year 😂
Imagine losing to your biggest rival with their head coach absent. 😂 And for the 3rd year in a row. Must be a tough day for osu
The real big ten championship and a playoff game
Man are y’all looking at MHJ? He’s going to be a problem frfr👀
Last play was a brilliant call with the nose guard pulling right and 32 blowing up 2 linemen to get to the QB!
Great game! You guys stayed poised. Go Blue!  Big shout to OSU! Awesome team you guys have!
This was Michigan's 1001st victory.  In Roman it is known as MI
f*** ohio state.
Its ok for Michigan to steal signals, but its not ok for Ohio State to sell their own memorabilia.
That early interception and missed FG hurt OSU in this game
Gus Johnson is a future hall of famer no doubt
So does this push Michigan to the number 1 spot in the playoff rankings? It should as Georgia has not beat a number 2 team.
As usual throwing the ball too much that's why this OState coach can't win because he doesn't believe in running a damn ball.
Marvin Harrison jr #1 2024 draft pick and Heisman winner
Yes !
Michigan just needs to leave Jim at home
Twice in this game Michigan defenders laid some wood on Ohio State receivers and made them take it like a G.
Go Blue!!!!!!!!!!!
Isn't it interesting that if Michigan plays a close game with Maryland, the narrative is that the Big 10 is awful? However Alabama can rally in the last minute to beat a .500 Auburn team and suddenly it's see how tough the SEC is?
lmaooo 😂🤣
What a great game!
Puckeyes never led in this game!!!! Go blue!!!
Hold this L OSU. Go Blue.
That was the tightest game I've seen the Wolverines play. No interception and OSU might have beaten us. Lots of respect to the Buckeyes. They played hard.... Go Blue !
Both teams played well enough to come out with a "V", but only one did it: MICHIGAN!!! Hail to the Victors!!!
No excuses this time ohio state fans. Fair and square 3 in a row
Love the toughness of this team. They have so many guys to step up and make the big plays.  OSU was a great team, no doubt , but Michigan is such a fighter.   Can't wait for the Big 10 commish to hand Jim Harbaugh the trophy next Saturday
Truly, it can be said: whoever wins, we lose.
GO BLUE YEEEEAAAAHHH!!!!
GO BLUE! 💪🏾
It’s about time Michigan finishes a game.   I hope they win the whole thing
ITS GREAT .. TO BE .. A MICHIGAN WOLVERINE .. from Germany 〽️
So glad Ohio State lost 😂🎉
We’ve always been better than them…but now it shows. (Looks down nose toward the border of Ohio)
BIG 10 was strong this year
Even without a coach Michigan still won.
Greatest overall football game I've watched in my 24 years
Less than 4 minutes worth of game highlights? Really 🫣 Damn good game and that’s all we get? I smell a buckeye homer..🫨
Congrats Michigan from TCU 🐸.   Will be cheering for yall!  Remember, you can’t possibly do worse than we did!
Both team's D showed up today. Congrats to the Maize and Blue for being the better one.
Ohio proves they are one again overrated
Both teams gave the fans their money worth. Great war,I mean, game!
Ohio State exhibition schedule 10 - 0, regular schedule 0 - 1 !!!
Congratulations to Michigan wolverines from a Clemson tigers fan! Go Blue!!
Solid W. Worry about the future down the road and just gotta enjoy the ride!
HAIL TO THE VICTORS!!
E Z W
Love my buck’s always tough loss today,,, Michigan was better today,,, go buck’s

The rumor mill says Cryin' Ryan is on a plane to Iowa City right now with Michigan's signals and playbook.
The Victors…
🤔whatever NFL team picks up B.C and McCarthy it’s going to be  🔥
If I never hear Gus Johnson call another Michigan game it will be to soon. Congrats Michigan Go Blue!!!
Someone please start a go fund me to raise 5 million for Ryan Days contract buy out. He has topped out. We have seen what he is cappable of doing.
Great Win! Go Blue!
YEAH BABY WHAT A GREAT DAY INDEED DOWN GOES THE ohio state buckeyes👎😆😁✌️
Go Blue
It's so satisfying to see the Buckeyes get put in their place. Especially by Michigan!  GO BLUE!!
Gus Johnson--I want this person calling every game.
What a game! Go Blue Forever!!!
Wolverine alumi 1987 Go Maize and Blue!!
yay and the buckeye go down. bye felicia
bro marvin harrison jr might be a all time great fr he made that one hand catch while being held look like childs play
My sources say at a FRI media event on Dec 1st, coach day will be replaced by former Jim TresseL, and Jean smith, formerly known as gene smith, well she will be giving this big announcement, as many feeL the game today was in fact, rigged by AI , any coach who won't go for it on 4th down and under five yards, needs to start playing hockey cause they don't get the game of football 🎉❤
HAIL! 🟦🟨🟦🟨
Coach Dey will be working at McDonalds soon.  Go Blue!!
Go Wolverines! ND fan here.
Jerry and Urban - A backup coach and rigged officials and you still lost  -  Eat it - Unprofessional and biased.
buckeyes are a bunch of Muts, hahahaha!!!  Ugly cheerleaders too. Go Blue!!!
Sometimes the better team loses.
Now, shut up about the ( sign ) bull##%^^! .
GO BLUE!! Michigan with no head coach and all the distractions are still able to pull it off!! This Michigan team is definitely very special to beat the number 2 team in the. Country even with all that happened! Against all odds! GO BLUE!
All that to get shellacked by Georgia soon.
How bad you beat MY PENN STATE LIONS is who would of won this game ..
Refs bailed yall, enjoy it b4 u get smoked in playoffs
I’m done wit Ohio state we js lost 3 times ina row
No coach and we still stick it to them. Just shows how good we play reguardless. Let’s go blue.
America's Team defeats The Evil Empire AGAIN!!!!!! Wooohoooo!
A win is a win, especially in this rivalry!  As a UM fan Ohio played a good game, not good enough though…. Good job coach Moore.  Horrible call not going for the first down though, could’ve costed the game.
I love how the big ten is copywriting smaller channels highlight reels whilst making the worst highlight reel. 3 minutes?? Seriously??
If McCarthy made the correct read and kept it on that last 3 and 5 there wouldn’t have been need for a heart attack with a minute left.
Cam ain’t gonna like this
Congratulations OSU fans! T H E Ohio University gets invitation to Idaho Potatoes Bowl!🎉🎉🎉
This is a message for Ryan Day. You had Lightning in a Bottle with Lincoln Kienholz. You put Kienholz on the shelf when you could have created a wrinkle the one week of the year when you need to create a wrinkle. What a shame. What a waste of a perfect season. What a waste of opportunity to create a culture of success. Your next mistake will be playing Air Nolan instead of Kienholz next year. Admit it. You will put the weight of the world on Air Nolan like you did with CJ Stroud and Justin Fields. You will lose to Michigan again next year. You will lose Lincoln Kienholz to the portal. Kienholz will win the Heisman at another school like Oregon or Texas A&M. Lightning in a Bottle. Sadly, you deserve defeat. Your ego is so large that you refuse to play the most athletic and exciting and creative player on your offensive roster. As a life long Buckeye fan, I am deeply disappointed in Ryan Day. Three years in a row and the message could not be more clear. The Game is not a time to be conservative. The Game is not Indiana. The Game is not Minnesota. What a shame. What a waste.
Rivalry games are the best when both teams play well and both tems played well today. I'm neutral I jusk like college football!
Ryan Day on the hot seat? Couldn’t win even with Harbaugh out. Great game and I don’t think it’s Day’s fault (his players played hard). But if you lose too many of The Game, you’re bound to get fired eventually. Especially when you inherited a stacked team like he did.
Wow! All over the internet! 3 highly rated verbal commitments are going to de commit from OSU! Wonder how many more? Developing……..
Congratulations Michigan from a Penn State fan !
How'd that work out for you today? Not the best in the land no more..... Well, If they ever were anyway
How much you wanna bet Ohio State fans want Ryan Day GONE!!?
After many years they finally be Ohio state
rigged
Free Haurbaugh 🎉
Michigan > Ohio State > Penn State > the rest ... every year it’s the same 😂
No knock on Michigan but this roster is “way too predictable”. Short slants to the wide receiver ~ Corum up the middle for 5-6 yards. Georgia/Alabama ~ Washington licking their chops come playoff time.
MICHIGAN VS EVERYBODY   MICHIGAN 3   EVERYONE 0
I'm a ohio state fan. Michigan had to cheat 3 years to win 3 years. Michigan won't ever win a playoff game let alone a national championship. The head coach loser there better with out him
Ohio States game plan was “way too conservative” offensively. Marvin Harrison “should have been the number 1 target all game. There was no creativity ~ team look pedestrian offensively. Defensively ~ where are the “stars” - can’t match up against elite players / got gashed all game.
Ryan Day should go see the WIZARD OF OZ...... perhaps he may get a brain. 😂🤣
W Michigan I’m a Tennessee vols fan but that college doesn’t have a hockey team but Michigan dose so I would love to go to Michigan to play hockey there so good game
You forgot the missed field goal in the 2nd quarter! That was one of the most memorable plays!
Happy Birthday #2 Blake Corum!
Both of these teams can't even beat my team South Carolina Gamecocks. Because I still remember Jadeveon Clowney putting a big huge hit on the Michigan RB from the Outback Bowl Game in 2013. Also Ohio State has never beaten South Carolina Gamecocks. Because South Carolina Gamecocks owns the series record 3-1 all time against Michigan and also South Carolina Gamecocks owns the series record 2-0 all time against Ohio State.
Congratulations Michigan Wolverines & Go Blue!
What I seen today first and foremost was a great game. But coming from a Georgia fan both team looks very appetizing 🤣. Ohio States coach is terrible. But great game none the less
McCord - God bless him and I mean that, but at this level he's in over his head.  Mccarthy is the real deal, even under great pressure, the kid comes through. Congrats Michigan.
Nail biter all the way through! Great job, Michigan!!! 💙💛💙💛
Guess tom Brady ain't giving his ring to CJ Stroud? 😂😂😂
You dont throw slants against Will Johnson 🤣
Pretty short highlights for the biggest rivalry.
As a Tennessee Vol fan, I say YESSSSSSSSS !
Is Marvin Harrison Jr. ever going to graduate from College. He's way too good to be playing anywhere by the NFL.
As a Michigan fan I’m so glad this game is over so I can go back to loving Marvin Harrison Jr, the kid is special!!!
I love wolverines  I hate ohio state from a miami  hurricanes  fan
Congrats to the Detroit Wolverines!!
Props to Turner coming up huge on some very important FG’s!
Congratulations to My Michigan Wolverine.
Harbaugh suspended for first 3 games and last 3 games but michigan overcomes all because they are the best team
Michigan got lucky
Lets go
Ohio state had michigans coach suspended then still went and lost 😂😂😂
Go BLUE!!!
Michigan is America’s team
Season over for the sucknuts
3 straight!!! 🎉🔥🥳 GO BLUE!!! THE NEW OWNERS OF THE RIVALRY!!!💯
The only thing that made watching this better is that we were blessed with Gus Johnson commentating
Congratulations to Michigan. They deserved the dub. I would love to see a rematch in the playoffs, but I doubt OSU will make it. We will see.
Ohio St fans, whuh happennnnnduuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhh
Gg michigan, mccord is terrible and osu doesnt deserve a playoff spot this year
The absolute sadness and misery the people of Columbus are feeling warms me to the core. No, I am not a Michigan fan but I know the people of Columbus.
What in Bob Evans name is going on in Ohio??? 3 straight losses to Michigan?? The only time Ohio State is supposed to lose to Michigan is when Desmond Howard or Charles Woodson suit up for the Maize and Blue and their eligibility has been exhausted for a while. With 3 straight Al’s Ohio State is quickly approaching “Jordan without shoes to sell” territory. Outside of a national championship, beating Michigan every year is your job but I guess y’all got a PPP loan and started calling off from work lately. You know, Urban Meyer was on the postgame coverage out there. On second thought, I don’t think OSU is willing to go down that road again, plus we gotta keep Meyer in the stash for UCLA if we ever need a coaching change lol. But, after 3 losses to Michigan, for a year we have to drop “THE” from the front of Ohio State. For now, and until you beat Michigan again, you’re just “OSU”. Are we talking “Oklahoma State”, “Oregon State” or “Ohio State”?? Who knows, but this is the predicament you’re in now Ohio State.
Hail to the victors  Crying Ryan beat even after he tried to get the wolverines in trouble
GO BLUE!
Nicely done Michigan from a Ohioan...Grew up on MI-OH border...3rd day after getting my OH driver's license I drove to Ann Arbor. 50 years ago.
Go Blue!!!
What a game GO BLUE
Why wouldn’t you throw it to the flat wide open and stop the clock instead of over the middle?
Go Blue! BOSA
LETS GOOOO MICHIGAN
Michigan should not be allowed in collage football playoffs cheaters now this win should have an * next to it😂😂😂
Great game Good Michigan win. But some of the worst secondary play I've seen do DBs and Corners ever turn around to find the ball even in the NFL. If they would turnaround it will be a lot more Ints and breakups
Ohio State won 24 To 23.  My dad is a retired football ref.  Go USC
The now - #2 Michigan wins 〽️💙💛🏈🏈 Jim back next weekend Let's Go Blue!!!!
MICHIGAN vs EVERYONE.   MICHIGAN WINS! ❤❤MICHIGAN WINS! ❤❤
Can osu still make the cfp? What would need to happen?
Its GREAT to be A MICHIGAN WOLVERINE!!!!!   Go blueee all the doubters can be quiet now we best built for the natty this year jim harbaugh has brought a culutre of winning to THE TEAM and the players bought in.. this was a game for the ages and these 3 wins in a row has restoked the rivalry !!!!
MICHIGAN HAS 1001 RESEASONS TO BE HAPPY!
Threepeat, let’s keep it pushing. Go Blue!
What a game. Exciting from start to end.
No wonder Ohio state can’t move the ball. Too busy eating all of those cupcakes during the season.
Does Sherrone Moore get credit for win or does JH get credit.  Sherrone is now is 1 - 0 vs OSU.  😂 Ryan Day still standing on 3rd base.
Good job Wolverines from a Penn State alumni!
UofM: Three more missions for the national championship.
BET! GO BIG BLUE!!! 💛💙
RESPECT to The Ohio State University from a Wolverine fan 🐾
Go blue 💛💙
I hope the committee votes Ohio state in. I’d love to see us get pounded twice in one year by Michigan.
HAIL TO THE VICTORS!!!!!!!!!!!
Ryan Day has got to go !  I've been saying it for 3 years now !
I hope the committee votes Ohio state in. I’d love to see us get pounded twice in one year by Michigan.
Great game great rivalry
What a game 💙💛💙💛 Go Blue it's great being a Wolverine 🏈
​again >>> Ryan Day is too loyal to his "limited" QB and not Buckeye nation!
IT’S GREAT TO BE A MICHIGAN WOLVERINE 💙!!
How can anyone say McCord did well. He is a garbage qb who won’t even get to hold an nfl clipboard.
Go Blue . Michigan Wins again.  You Ohio boy's  played a good game be proud of yourselves. Totally your coaches fault 🐀.
OSU has definitely improved from last year. They scored one more point than last year.
IT’S GREAT. TO BE. A MICHIGAN WOLVERINE.
Clearly Ohio state is not even close to being in the same class as Michigan. Ohio state deserves credit for nothing.
Was just in the stadium watching this live. Greatest game I’ve ever watched live. Most fun I’ve ever had
Cuckeyes lose! America Wins!
Clearly Ohio state is not even close to being in the same class as Michigan. Ohio state deserves credit for nothing.
Glad Brady won his bet.
Ryan day cry baby, best player on Michigans team u p u s s y
The big 10 tried to keep Michigan out of the playoffs but it didn’t work. F big 10
Great game Mich , M go Blue . Ohio St , that was a tough game , Ryan Day , Your team played a great game
Must fire Day immediately. Absolutely no success at Ohio state. Another failed season. Accomplished nothing. Time to totally tear the team down. Start over. Michigan now owns the big ten. Sadly I live in the garbage dump they call Ohio.
hey big 10 F U C K O F F. oh they cheated susped Harbaugh. they stole our signs, they scored more points, they ran faster and harder they hit us in the mouth. F..... O F F
Michigan wins! Ohio State goes down! Again and again and again! The most obnoxious Ohio State fans can eat it!
yall can gave ryan day he beats ohio state every year lol
We done it again! I'm so hyped up right now! Beat them Buckeyes again! LETSGOBLUE LETSGOBLUE
Go Blue!!!〽️〽️
It hurts as a Buckeyes fan but we did have positive takeaways like Harrison having a good game but Burke should’ve had a pick there but we beat ourselves 2 bad ints missed kick. Disappointed but  good game Blue. I am gonna have to go one a long walk after this one.
What's the excuse now?
lol 3 years straight, ohio state fans enjoying it?
That game winning int got me hurt. All my friend went crazy and jumped on me.
LunarEquity... all that cryin', what's the baby gonna do?😢
Instant classic
Didn't i say my wolverines will win...maze and blue thru and through
I’m not a fan of either team but this game was crazy! Congrats to Michigan
Go Michigan!!!!!!!!!!!
Ohio state couldn't stay humble and it cost them
Ryan Day hired a private investigator to come up with some sign stealing BS and then the spineless Big ten commissioner suspended Harbaugh for 3 games because of it … dude sign stealing give me a break,, I could watch YouTube clips and come up with some of the signs teams use …How about the rest of the BiG ten teams sending TCU ,UM signs last year… Good job Day you couldn’t beat an  interim coach in the biggest game of your career,,sissy
Can head coaches enter the transfer portal?   Asking for a friend
Coach Ryan Day  please stay at osu. Don't go to Texas A&M. Signed by Harbaugh.
Congrats Coach Harbaugh
As a humble Michigan fan all I can say about Maserati Marv is good God almighty is he a complete and utter beast of a receiver?! I can’t wait to see him in the nfl!  To all the osu fans saying “cheaters” or making excuses, please just stop being hypocritical and choosing not to remember your teams violations and mistakes, and Ryan “baby back bit*h” Day is not the guy that you were told he’d be
Michigan beat a great team. Unfortunately in this year’s format OSU may not make the playoffs.
As a Michigan fan, I want the Lions to somehow draft MHJ. Lol
MARVIN HARRISON JR IS A DAWGGGGGG!!  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Shout out MICHIGAN for being the best team in the NATION, until they meet my FSU NOLES!! ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
As a neutral fan, I’m looking forward to future seasons with this new Big 10 alignment where we could see these two teams square off in back to back weeks
Mute Gus Johnson 😂
Well Done! Not a Michigan fan but i cant stand Ohio State! Good job!
What an amazing year for Michigan.  One of the greatest Big Ten teams ever.
Go michigan
It wasn’t McCord.    People have been on this rookie way too much.    Fans are so silly.     The defense couldn’t stop them.     But was a good game.
Michigan has taken over the rivalry.  Time for Day to go bye..bye.
Go Blue!!!!!!!!!!
Mazarati Marvin is the most overrated receiver I've seen in a while.
After all those years of Ohio St. having Michigan's number, This is so satisfying to watch! Ohio St. should still be able to play in the playoffs.
I don’t wanna hear the fake congratulations from all you haters 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾 y’all said we cheated and we can’t beat top 10 teams and all types of stuff…. Only sign I have left for y’all is 🖕🏽
The one day of the year when EVERYONE is a Michigan fan!
Congratulations to Michigan University!!! 😉
Cheaters do indeed prosper.
Im always gonna be a buckeye girl, but good sportsmanship means congratulations to you all.
FU biased Gus Johnson. Who is “world famous “ now you pr!ck
I hope the Iowa Hawkeyes give Michigan plenty of fits so Ohio State can make the college football playoff and I'll and Ohio state gets that rematch I really hope Iowa does not make things very easy for Michigan
OSU maybe nxt years 😂 GO BLUE!!!
Michigan Stadium holds  100,000 people . Only saw a few OSU fans . Really shocking !  🏈🙋‍♂️
Gus Johnson is the worst.  As an announcer you’re there to call the game, not make it all about yourself.
Congratulations to Texas longhorns from a lakers fan
Another win, more Ohio recruits to play at Michigan
As a Ohio State fan hopefully if Ohio state gets a rematch against Michigan in the college football playoffs Michigan loses Ohio state will never beat McCarthy I'll never get to see McCord win a Big ten championship but Ohio State needs to start playing with teamwork if they want to beat Michigan and quit allowing so many stupid big plays and when the time comes when Ohio state does get that rematch against Michigan I hope Michigan struggles I give Ohio State until 2050 to give a 15-0 season it's on my bucket list and I still want to see Ohio State beat McCarthy for the first time that's on my bucket list as well I want McCarthy to take his first loss against Ohio State if not this year hopefully next year the committee better be generous to Ohio State and only drop them to number 4
Great. Now the big ten will have a terrible showing in the playoff. Michigan hasn’t won a bowl game in like ten years.
From a Michigan fan I can’t believe OSU chose Kyle McCord as their QB after all those years of having black guys dominate ..can’t complain we got the win just a bit fishy
#1...here we come.
So Buckeyes, how did we cheat now, crying babies
Go bucks 😂😂😂 you bunch of Bums again I'm through with you sad sacks.
Man you lost to the o line/OC. Damn I’ve been watching this rivalry since 80 to see the talent Day has had and to be 0-3😂😂😂😂😂😂
Greatest sports rivalry of all time. Hard to compare anything to this.
Great game OSU fans.. Can’t help but admire Harrison Jr. and McCord was so much better than I anticipated. That being said, GO BLUE!
Awesome game OSU, but go BLUE!!   Great game all around!!!!
All is right with the world Ohio State looses. Doesn’t matter who they play even if they play Notre Dame an Ohio State loss is a beautiful thing!
Weres the excuses from the stolen signals crowd?
Let's GO! Big win for Blue! GO WOLVERINES!
No HARBAUGH, NO ZINTER, NO WILL J. NP. GO BLUE!!!
As an Ohio State fan, good game Michigan. I’m not sure about the Wilson td but it’s whatever. Maybe they could meet again if osu makes the playoff.
Without Jim Harbaugh  Without Will Johnson  Without Zack Zinter  Michigan Still Gets The Job Done
Good stuff, GO BLUE
Ryan day snitched and still got beat by a interm coach lol 😆 😂
GO BLUE🎉!!!
See you in the B1G Championship
Congrats to Meatchicken! Go Dawgs!!!
I heard OSU , still hasn’t changed their play signals!  Go blue! I told you.   I said 34-24.
Will should've had a td, anyone else see that? Ran straight into the o lineman.
ryan day is now 1-3 lol
Another classic...NFL Scouts have to be drooling . Both teams have alot of guy that are going to be playing on Sundays
Enjoy Michigan fans 2024 probation and no bowl game.
Hail to the Victor's....3 years and counting.
No Head Coach, Zinter left game, Will Johnson Left the game. Defensive hold call from outer space on Mason Graham giving OSU essentially a touchdown. No more excuses about sign stealing. We’re just the best, deal with it
Hey Hey OHIO STATE.GO BACK WHERE YOU COME FROM..LOSERS.  🤣
Today was the end of a era. The BIG will not be the same starting next year and this rivalry wont be the same again
BS non touchdown
Shoulda been a ot
Michigans fan base is like 90% outsiders and 10% students/alumni.
This was a nailbiter at the end, but the more deserving team won. Revenge for OSU getting into the playoff last year, on the backs of their Alumni's $$$ and influence. J.J. better not lay another egg this year, He was totally responsible for the TCU loss, for which he does not receive enough criticism.
Great 👍,  I'm from Akron Ohio, I stopped liking Ohio state in high school, when I met Woody,  in the 1970s,   he was so rude 😒,  Ohio state is always over rated 😅,
That catch by Marv was insane. Cannot wait to see what he does in the NFL.
BIG CONGRATULATIONS TO THE MICHIGAN FOOTBALL TEAM A WELL DESERVED WIN .  !!!!😁👍
Bye Bye Ohio State 😊
Why the duck do they storm the feild. When we won 8 straight we weren’t doing that
I guess CHEATERS do win.
Go Blue!!!
Gus Johnson is the best.
It’s great to be a Michigan Wolverine 💙〽️
That man calling the game gives me old madden vibes
Fire Ryan day…. Poor coaching
Won SANS Harbaugh!!! Hate hate hate hate!! GO BLUE!
Those who stay will be champions ..
Ryan Day is the new John Cooper. I don’t care how many wins he has, if you can’t beat UM or in the post season, you don’t have it.
What a GREAT, complete team win!  Complimentary football at its BEST!  GO BLUE!!!!!!
Great game
What’s the excuse now, GO BLUE💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛
McCord is bad
WOLVERINES!!! 🎊🎊👍
Well done by Michigan referees
Michigan won their National Championship today. We all know what's gonna happen when they play a top 5 team not named Ohio State, as evidenced by their horrific losses the past two years in the first round of the College Football Playoff.
Yay Wolverines!!!👍woo hoo!!!
At least OSU can beat Penn State
WTG..Wolverines
😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉go blue🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
"Offenses score points, DEFENSES win CHAMPIONSHIPS>"  Congrats to The World Famous Michigan Wolverines.
What excuses will the Snowflake Bucknuts make now
GO BLUE!
MiCHigaNnnnnn!!!
Mich fan here, great game and an instant classic. Gg OSU. 🫡
What's your excuse now Big Ten? You thought you would screw us by  taking Harbaugh out of the games. Didn't work.
Rivalry..... Son.  This is what is called a Rivalry.   The Dealer delt with it.  The job you gonna have to do!  Nice win Michigan 👍
Even by Michigan beating Ohio State today the College Football League favored a team that got beat by Michigan 2 games in the roll. So much disrespect but Michigan showed The polls board that how much you wanted so bad to keep Ohio State in the Top 4 Playoff Spot. You still failed. Now we will see if you still have that bias toward Michigan being No 2 even though they should be No.1 right now.
HAIL YEAH!
Kyle McWho? Maserati Who? Cryin Ryan Who? 😂  GO BLUE 💙
Fun fact: Ohio State has not beaten Michigan once in the 2020’s
Ohio who?
Gus Johnson calling this game was awesome
So glad michigan proved they dont need "SiGn StEaLiNg" to beat ohio state and win the big ten! But I will give props to ohio state, they played much tougher defense than the previous 2 years.
❌hi❌ what happenduuhhhhh
LOL
go cry now coach Ryan
GO BLUE...FOX ANNOUNCERS WERE TERRIBLE!  HAIL TO THE VICTOR
Hahaha what a dog fight…just so the winners can play a real team and lose in about a months time
Big Michigan fan and that was the best game between the two since 2016....maybe even 2006! OSU is very good and it was really 2 evenly matched teams. Just two or 3 plays seperated them.
〽️🫡 3 in a row boys !!! Go Blue !
Great game.  Three years in a row Michigan gets the W.  Wow.
The Roman numeral for 1001 is MI.😊
Where is all that energy evryone had before the game. All that sign stuff and cheating, where's that energy at. Blue stood tall against them all. Proud to be a UM fan, Blue and Maze never green and white. They even making money Blue now....... Let's goooooooooooo
💛💙
Ohio State fans, uno, dos tres, one two three, quattro, WOOLY BULLY, LETS GO BLUE.
I LOVE PROVING THE HATERS WRONG
McCord is a blowout
This is from an osu fan this game was excellent I’m not even mad that we lost Michigan was great today the better team deserved the win go bucks
Ohio is so garbage
Ryan Day is the perfect embodiment of Ohio state fans... Constantly crying to the refs and whining on the sidelines. Tears of Buckeye fans quench my thirst!!
GO BLUE MUFU...AS!!!!!
3 in a row 👍👍👍 Go Blue!!!!
How many times do we need to teach you this lesson old man!
Where are the Michigan haters saying they haven't beaten anyone??
Worst announcer ever
That was an instant classic...... GO BLUE!
One of the greatest games I’ve ever seen 😮
Better enjoy this win you will not beat Ohio State the next decade!
Qb lost the game for them.
This game did not dissapoint! GO BLUE! 〽️
Go blue great win
Grads to ttun you earned this win and osu deserve this lost...they  made too many mistakes
Ohio State is about as useful as a gum wrapper and about as smart as a Sloth. Talk about overrated as usual. Talkin about cheating. Sign stealing dont make u weak in the weight room. Sign stealing dont make u let a RB throw from roughly 20 yrds in ur most important game. Michigan against everyone sit down Ohio and enjoy going to the Carless Bowl. GO BLUE! 💙 💛
LETS GO BLUE!!!!!💙💛💙💛💙💛💙💛
Funny how trying rank Ohio over Michigan after Michigan was favorite all year
Feels good to be a Wolverine !!!!
Ryan Day is pathetic for losing this 3 times in a row. and insult to injury a assistant coach out coached him.
Time for Ryan start looking for new house …he got one more year then he got to go …go bucks
Iowa fan here.  Glad Michigan won.  The Hawkeyes don't have much of a chance against the Wolverines, but glad Iowa is playing them and not Ohio State. Can't stand Ohio State, which started with Woody Hayes.  Liked Schembechler and Harbaugh is kind of a nut but a great coach and I like him.  Hope it's at least a competitive game next week.
3 peat baby go blue
Ryan Day = John Cooper 2.0
FIRE RYAN DAY!!!!! period he doesn't have what it takes damn dude😡😡😡😡
My favorite team is whoever beats OSU.
What's going to be the complaints about MU now? The wrong shoe strings 😅
Goo Dawgs 🥷🏾🐐 but im happy for  Michigan cause ohio state dont play nobody for people to ride they waves the way they do
Michigan won because they cheat. Not because they are good. Michigan is the armpit of the US.
Osu fan here and grads to ttun you earn this win and osu deserve to lose this game with all the mistakes that they have made  not mad at you
Our FG kicker is the truth.  Right down the middle every time!!!!
I hate the way this guy commentates 🤦🏽‍♂️
Coach Moore, You are a GIANT of a man!
3 time defending champions Go Blue Baby 💙💛
Well done by the Michigan Wolverines!
Michigan trying to make it 3 str8 years of choking in the playoffs😂 Keep up the good work!
It was destined for Michigan to win pregame said it all
As an OSU fan, I never saw this team as national championship contender when watched them play. The defense has improved from previous years buts it’s still not amazing, and Kyle McCord ain’t it and not on par with guys like Pryor, Haskins, Stroud or Fields.  Need to find a QB this off-season.
Fire Day.
Now we can say we beats osu with a back up coach
I have a sign for all the Michigan haters 🖕🏼 Go Blue! 〽️
😂😂😂😂
What a game! Those who stay will be champions. GO BLUE!
Happy Birthday, Blake Corum!
People really thought blohio was the #2 team GO BLUE
J.J. McCarthy played like Tom Brady today.
Crying Ryan lost again.
Lets go 〽️ichigan ! This team is built to win it all !
3 in a row!! Haven’t done that since ‘97!
No snow. No flu. No Harbaugh  All the OSU fans. You got any excuses today.
GO BLUE
Without the coach!
So to everyone wanting to play that "Michigan cheaters" joke.. you lost 3 strait to an interim head coach missing an all American right guard😂😂😂😂 Walk tf out
Congrats Michigan
GO BLUE! WE BEAT OSU! 12-0!
The trifecta Go Blue!
See.....Cheaters do win !!!!
Congratulations to the Michigan Wolverines from an Iowa fan. 👍
Michigan officially leads Ohio Overall  61-51-6
Go Blue ! 3 in a row 💪
This game is sooo much fun
Blue wins!!!  Oh My!
