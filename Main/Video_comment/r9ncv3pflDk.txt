Nahhhh yeaaa nahhhh YEAAAAA
my prentes are soo mean
Chill out it's just pretend
There are way too much anime reference
Suck the muzzle brake on my HK416
I love assassination calls room koro sensie ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I KNOW I SAW YUJI IN THE SECOND SCENE
3:00 Is that why you guys stopped calling it "Global Cooling" and then changed the boogieman's name to "Global Warming" and then realized it was just better to call it "climate change"?
Omg swear all the animation people hang out
What do you mean you are going to send me the time out because if you are not living in my country, how are you going to do that you are living in my country then you don’t know where I live
If you let this happen, it can encourage bad and criminal behavior in your adult life. If you never get onto them for playing guns they would probably think that is it OK and not illegal if they play with real guns and shoot somebody here’s where I wanted to say something about that: 5:58
Playing guns isn’t allowed, but what about playing irl quiet place? (I do this all the time with friends our of school..)
i pretent guns
Do I get sent to time out if it isn’t pretend
4:55  I AM HERE!- All might from My hero academia
Gun laws are one of the reasons im glad to live in Australia. And to those complaining about spiders, my honest answer is... you get used to them

0:47
The fact that the girl with glasses is my bus driver name
I love the souma yukihira in the back periodically
How are you supposed to send me to timeout if you do not live in my country but if you do live in my country, you are not in my school you are not a teacher in my classroom and you are not a teacher in my scope so yeah
is no one gonna mention how 19 literally is a legal adult-
Kids think that you’re an adult when ur twenty 💀
2:56 Well, I don't think global warming is a myth, but I think the whole "Humanity created it" part is a myth. Because long before the first human wandered the earth it already had done several climate changes, uo and down the temperature scale, we're just at a rising part of that repeating wave right now.  But pollution still isn't nice, as it negatively impacts basically every living being on this whole planet.
I like how the walls in the classroom is Pokémon
Koro sensei !!!!!!!
Then ill play real guns
What if I do play gun? What are you gonna do? Ha ha
🔫
I wont play with pretend guns        but I will with real guns 😈

when i grow up i wanna be after school teacher😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 how to do become one? (im a boy? is this bad? ) (how to apply?) (😭😭)
If that Bo kid was so concerning in the USA, I must have been so concerning as a first-grader doing verbatim the same thing here in Canada. Where did I even get the idea that guns are toys?
I love the cat dance 💃
Did anyone notice Mha characters in the background LOVE IT 😍
My mom works with kids with behaviour issues and i have been told many stories, one that comes to mind is when a kid used a feather as a knife and went around “stabbing” people, he was 5. Apparently his dad played violent video games in front of him
What if Ken was his real name? He never would’ve known.
New comment
my teacher has a dog named bo, hes also chaos. I just thought that was funny.
ngl, when i was i kid i also used to play guns a lot, but i dont think it was that bad cause we were in a  "not that serious" gun problem
PIOUPIOUPIUOPIUOPIUO I AM PLAINGE GONSE 😆😆😆🤭🤭🤭😶‍🌫🤫

Kids are so random, they’ll say anything that comes to mind
MISSING THE CHAOS
me on my way to time out X_X
I grew up with guns, and even from my perspective that woman didn't make any sense. That kid almost certainly didn't meet the legal requirements to carry a gun, and even if he did, it would still be illegal to have one on school grounds, and even if it weren't, it would still be illegal to pull it out and pretend to shoot his friends because that's threatening behavior (and also how people accidentally get shot). I suspect the woman understood all of this and just saw you as a helpless scapegoat she could take her frustrations out on. Personally, I'd have called her on it (and maybe also been fired, but as you observed in your vid, bad behavior won't change if you let them get away with it).
Bow is exactly like my brother
No gun hamanations
3:20 that’s my name
PEW PEW PEW
lol
I'm 7 an I'm in 1st grade 🤔

*hi* -hi-
3:14 HAWKS AND KOROSENSIII
am I the only one old enough to remember playing cops and robbers at his age? GI joe, transformers, superheroes.   no wonder this kid was a problem. there's such a thing as too much, but imagine giving a kid time out every time he played dinosaurs because that's his 6 y/o fixation?
Your cat looks like the cat from adventure time fionna and cake with Casper and Nova
There were 4 kids
"Bo's" mom is crazy for saying" Whats wrong with guns?", WHAT DO YOU THINK IS WRONG WITH GUNS.
Hey was I the only one to  notice the my hero academy pushes on the shelves go to when bow gets caught for his bad behavior and you can see an all might plush
I’m sorry I just can’t ignore the vaporeon in the background of this whole thing they are my favorite water pokemon and they bring me so much joy thank yoy
4:20 I like how you drew My hero academia characters in the top right corner😂❤
3 u tubers coement Including me
Anyone else come here to check if they made any embarrassing comments? 😑
Yeah, dealing with Karens has always been above my pay grade.  I make pretty good money now, but I make sure to never take positions where I have to deal with people like that. The second anyone treats me that way, I go and get the person that is technically in charge of me, I tell the Karen to speak to them, and I leave the situation. I'll never get paid enough to deal with these people
2nd amendment ya'll
3:06 i dunno  Even back in the 90's the offspring said the opposite and things only gotten worse, especially in my experience
WHEN SHE SAID SUBSCRIBE THE SUBSCRIBE BUTTON TURNED RAINBOW
“With Bo in toe…”❤❤❤😂😂
4:19 who saw the Mha pictures
Don’t play pretend guns or she will send you to time out.
what about daisy????
I will never not be beyond done with this country's unhealthy obsession with guns. You handled that really well. I'm pretty sure I would've cussed her out while giving her a history and law lesson. In my experience people like that don't actually understand the history of the amendments or this country or the intent of the amendments, especially the first and second. (son and brother of lawyers)
I've worked in childcare, and I'm working at a children's theater now. I've always enjoyed working with the kids. The kids are never the issue. The PARENTS/adults in charge of said kids on the other hand, are often infuriating.
Karen   K: Known for starting drama  A: A mean person R: Rude E: Ear killer N: Not polite
when i was in pre k i didn't do pretend guns i drew and im gonna become like you still draw
1:54 can we talk about the naruto,koro-sensei,hawks, and all might plush in the back please
Why do we have Gon and Killias body guard
3:21 MY BROTHER CALLS ME BO!!
To the people that are all, "hE's aMeriCaN, iT's FinE foR hIm to pLaY gUns," you're part of the issue. If this kid grows up to be aggressive, violent, and decides he wants to shoot people for real, it'll be on you for encouraging that behavior from a young age and not telling him about why it's dangerous. Sure, in pretend, no real harm is being done, but you don't know if/when that kid will find a real firearm, and when he does, he'll treat it like it's some toy because nobody told him that it isn't.
koro sensei
Very nice work! I really like the simplicity of your designs!
This is my favorite Illymation video, but darn that contradicting title bothers me.
Gun gun gun gun gun gun gun gun gun gun gun gun gun gun gun gun
there a mazz toy
7:24 ok
As a texan i can say waving my second amendment rights is as fun as it is easy to be ruind by people like karen. Also i say this as im waving that right against some mareep in pokemon go for making me miss the rarest spawn in the game that i was definitely going to either use in battles or transfer to the nintendo switch
It's fine for a kid to play guns. Like, I get it, but just because stuff is happening now doesnt mean a game that's happened for generations is the cause of a new behavior
does that kind of summer job require any like degree cause i like working with small kids (God that sounds wrong)
Ur vids are awesome
is that maaz that child is holding captive
question. Have YOU ever went to big kid time out when you were their age?
But illy…. What if it’s a NERF gun?
"Don't play with replica guns" every airsofter including me😂
All people in the military has to go in big time out
NOOOO YEAHH NOOOO YEAHHH Legend has it they never stopped
😢
Even her more older videos are still AMAZING 🤩
I miss Kindergarten so much If only life was like this
Pew pew :3
Give the 6 year old a break he can play a game and I learned how to shoot when I was 4 so let the kid play

Hello illymation
I also worked with kids for a year and I had the cute moments with the younger kids but picking up the older kids went like this “ok guys let’s get in line not a blob” “no!! We’re not going outside cause it’s raining and it’s your fault hey dude kick that ball at the pictures on the wall!”
HAMINATIONZZZZ!!
KORO SENSEI
KAREN!!!

ant a thing wrong with playing pretend guns that was 99% of toys in 50 60 70s unless theres a threat like he saids im k...you or something at that point its a problem
Yeah that’s America for you
If I went to this school, I would get timeout SOO much, that I might’ve been a whole different person
One other negative  is kids peeing or crapping  their pants, throwing up, or some bodily fluid
noooo not time out
you said if I play pretend guns, I will get sent to Time out . Ummmm I think I’m gonna be in Time out for 20 years
Now that's what you call a karen
that is not nessere of lidering is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaddddddddddddd
HELP IM GOING TO TIME OUT!!!!!
WHO WOULD PASS THE CHEESE ITS!?
can u tel a secert
im glad to see a sweeter story after seeing the toxic pedo bf series
"What's wrong with guns?" "..Ma'am this is a child" 💀
boys in my class play with guns not all the time but one boy dose it too many times
6:15 Such a cool detail that Karen's lips show her saying "people like you" instead of "people like me" and so on, as she wouldn't be saying it from your perspective.
I was a bo
My comfort youtuber
god forbid bo finds someone playing school
So I can't  have a candy gun?
No way she just went What’s wrong with guns
E
Devin just got done watching Godzilla vs hedorah lol
I'm sorry... I don't agree with people just saying that guns should be taken away, because it leaves people otherwise defenseless and vulnerable to invasion, by their own government.  Also, I can't hold a gun myself... or it takes over me. Not even a knife, even if I'm using it for making a peanut and jelly sandwich... and I don't know what it is that does it, but even touching them makes me feel like I'm possessed by whatever is doing it.  So spiritual warfare is where it's at for me, or my bare hands for hunting and defending myself and others.  I've been trained in Heaven anyway, military... God's army.  I don't believe in a world without defending against tyranny. Guns help with that.
I'm not sure what people were thinking when they made guns with rocks and powder for fuel to projectile metal slugs at people or animals, when they could just use light in concentration intensified to be weapons and hunting tools... a flashlight pointed out at the heart of a beast could get food on the table without the mess better. If it was an intensified laser.  Seriously, human kind is allowed to utilize weapons because of defense and food, and there's no other man going to change God's mind about that right.
I was Devon
That was me, and my name is Louis
Dude when i was six  i frikin love nerf guns 😂
Turn the comments into a kindergartnen fight
This may be a stupid question but is illy implying that ms sheriff didn't know about the "karen." I don't mean to disrespect just want to make sure I have an accurate read on the situation?
“Her name isn’t Karen, but I think it suits her well” DANNNG ILLY
I love all the anime references especially the Pokemon ones and my hero Academia
“MA’AM, THIS IS A CHILD-“
Luigi got moves tho
entitled parents are the worst race on earth, especially conservative entitled parents
Luigi has moves lol
Anybody wanna play guns with me? We gotta be quiet so Mrs. Ily doesn’t notice us and put us in big kid Mrs. Sheriff timeout
It's almost disturbing how accurate Karen's depiction is in her two-facedness.  Most of them are cowards like that, hiding behind multiple personas.
0:13 as a 19 year old, this hits hard lmao
Guys no play guns life is on the line!
If anybody read my comment say hi
How could a 4 year old know about pollution and global warming!?
And the Hawks
Lol love the all might in the background
Yes yes yes yes s
Mew ♾️♾️♾️
Devin so wholesome 🥰
My mom is an Early Childhood teacher, and the reason why they can’t play pretend guns is because its too violent, and it can lead to potential threats in the future. Also why does a 1st grader know what guns are at that age??? When I was in 1st grade the only guns i knew about were the pea shooters from plants vs zombies
Yes mam
I'm seven
That "Karen" seriously needs a brutal reality check.
I don't care
🔫😈
Pew pew 🔫
As much as I'm not trying to justify gun use-im letting u know its in the male to want to play stuff like that after being exposed. Trust me I'm a guy. I would play army men and shit all day long when i was 7 or 8. Its all i would play. But i don't know. Nor do i feel homicidal urges from playing war as a kid. I know it sounds wrong and when i read it back,i will admit it does. But you kinda have to see where in coming from here. Not being sexist but when a little boy sees war on tv comic etc instantly it installs this like masculine thing where they feel the need to fight. Thanks for listening if you don't agree im open 2 opinions
☺😊
Who said I play “pretend” guns
0:29
:29
29:
COME ON EVERYONE! IT'S BEEN ALMOST 3 YEARS! SHE WON'T CHECK THE COMMENTS ON THIS VIDEO ANYMORE! WE CAN FINALLY PLAY PRETENDS WITH GUNS!!!!
No pretend guns? Good thing she was not apart of my school :3 or I would not see the sun as much every day
bro that Karen probably believes that gta5 is a game for kids lol
I love all the mha drawings it's so cute
“Mamn this is a child”
I was a preschool teacher this summer I def needed to watch this
Devin was like me when i was young
Even if you are a republican wanting to protect your second amendment right, child playing pretend to kill people is always inappropriate - this is not a political statement, it's just inappropriate, and I think it's fairly politically neutral to say that! I don't think that I should explain why playing like you are killing your class-mates is inappropriate... Again, there is nothing political in saying "guns = murder/are inherently made for murder = inappropriate for kids", and if you think that saying that "is" a political statement - you should go outside, touch grass, and watch less Fox News.   Thank you, that was my Ted Talk.
WHAT ABOUT FINGER GUns miss
5:08 “I AM HEREEE”
My brother is called beau
My brother is 4 and will play nurf guns with us
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 4:50
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 3:26

deven is american
its the fact that Bo was pretending to kill his friends that really worry me
I always liked guns and the fact that “YEEHAW TEXAS HELL YEAH FREEDOM GUNS F16 FIGHTER JET WAR IS PEACE” and stuff, and that’s fine to like those things. BUT FOR A 6 YEAR OLD?!?! S I X ?! I STARTED DOING THIS, EVEN THEN NOT AS VIOLENT AND LEARNING ABOUT AIRSOFT WHEN I WAS ALMOST A TEENAGER. man it sucks that you can’t talk to kids seriously because of their parents or you’ll get fired.
Kids angry parents are a different breed so when i see an angry parents im in my minds ok time to pray for the teachers the we hear screaming from the classroom  next to are club room and all we hear this : WHY IS MY CHILD IN ISOLATION  FU OMY F GODD ÆAAAAAAAAA
1:13 omg it’s demon slayer character clothes zenitsu,nezuko nad tanjiro!
I was 19 when I worked at a daycare too aw
2:48 why was he me??? I legit when I was 5-10 would tell ppl how bad plastic was for the grass and trees and how it made animals hurt I would get so mad when they didn't listen I still do I'm happy he understood at least
1:04 I worked at a daycare after school and it was always so cute that the kids would get upset if they all didn't get a hug when they said hi and goodbye to me everyday and they called me special nicknames and always said I was their big sister and thought my hair dye changed from the candy I would eat it was cute
❤
I dont play pretend guns I play real guns :)
ILLY! im playing with a big wooden block and pretending ITS A GUN !!!!!!!!1!!! >:)
My friend is seven but he plays with guns
Violence
I couldn’t help but zoom in on all the anime references ✨
To be honest, I think Bo has American Blood.
so, as of 2023 illy is 21?
When I was at a daycare I pretended that the Legos are guns
I’m watching a Shayy randomized run ad as soon as the kid said “do you know what the most horrible thing in the world is?” The most horrible thing appeared:   JERRY
its kinda normal for bo to do it! it isnt innapropriate its just having fun
God bless devin😂😂
*plays guns* pew pew🔫🔫
I’m 46% sure that I went to that after school place as a kid.😂
I know this'll make me sound bad but, I'm on team "What's wrong with Guns"?

I AM THE GUN
Pure shock went across her face when she said ilissa was "almost an adult"
7:25 n-n-n-noooo😭😭😭😭 m-m-miss aly-y-ysaaa it wasn't meeeee😭😭😭
I'll likely get roasted for this, but I kind of get the mom's  let's say issues with the rules. That being said, the purpose of the rule is altruistic, and an easy one to follow.   I grew up in the deep south where hunting with a parent or guardian was par for the course. I went a few times with my dad. We killed several squirelles, and I had fun. But not enough fun to do it again. Getting up early, a bunch of walking, then a bunch of sitting and waiting, too many mosquitoes. I'd also watch come classic action movies with my dad, like Rambo, anything with Jean Claude, mortal kombat, etc... and I'd partake in playground games that involved some aspect of many of those movies. This was the early 90s, if that wasn't obvious. So needless to say, no one ever really stopped us....and everything was fine.   I get it though. She's too old now, but if something like this had come up with my daughter, first off I'd say "It's a school rule, and it's easy to follow, so just don't do it."  followed by my best attempt and research to make it more understandable from a real world perspective.
There is a lot of ester eggs
Surprise mother effer *shotgun loading sounds* *BANG*
I love how Luigi is Dancing ☠️💀
hey my names delaney
What about fortnight
Miss Illy I swear I didn't play pretend guns bryson did it
No global warming doesn't exist, polution does
As someone for second amendment rights myself, I wouldn't encourage my kids to pretend to kill their friends with fake guns. If my child continuously did that, I'd be afraid that this would lead to something more serious in their teenage or adult lives later on. So, yeah, you and the staff there did the right thing. They're kids. They shouldn't be playing like that in the first place.
send me to timeout i dare you!!!!!11111111111
0:48 exactly!! I loved my daycare jobs, my kids were amazing. They taught me so much both figuratively and literally (they taught me how to play mancala, and regularly beat me at connect 4. Not bc I let them, but bc I didn’t expect them to be good and they really were.)
My dad told me the reason he bought us fake guns like nurf and bb he said it was to teach us how to use an actual gun wich worked with me
"So to make that fat cat money!"
Devin: Do you know what the most evil thing in the world is? ...    Harris
You made a part two
That Karen belongs in a daycare. Her behavior is like a literal child's and she should know better as a parent.
My dad was in world War 2
I was watching this on my phone and I found out you named a kid delainey so if I was a good I guess I'd be fun dip lol
"It's because of people like you that guns are being taken away from us!"  Hmmmm... for a parent... you're quite angry about losing your guns...  *Wait*
I can understand the kid saying “Oh so your almost an adult” to Illy because for the longest time I thought you were an adult when you turned twenty.
I work with kids on weekends and Thank God I've never run into a Karen. So many of the parents of kids I taught were really nice.
Beau is now a mass shooter
1:48 best anime refrences right there
Is that yuji itadori I see? 🫣

Bo getting a timeout for pretending to be be a crook is legit how he learns about how the law and justice system works.
Loving Luigi breaking it down in the background

NOOOOO
Devon is probably an environmentalist And Delaney probably has the same job As you From what you were like 19 or something
Like come on little dude We knew that this wouldn't last forever
Merry Christmas And Hanukkah whatever you celebrate

Keep it up 👍
If I was in charge of kids, I'd be on the next 48 and or news. Maybe even both
As I was watching this my THREE year old sister kept coming up to me and saying..; “I’m gonna murder you!”
"Dont Play Pretend Guns Or I Will Send You To Time Out"

Saw a Korosensei reeference.

Love your videos
0:01-7:18. ♥️💌🤍🤎💜💙
In the 5th grade ok signed up for safety patrol so what I did was open car doors, let kids inside, walked and observed the hallways ect and once me and the rest of safety patrol were opening the car one parent did not pull up even though he was supposed to we kept telling him that he needs to pull up and he refused he then got out opened the door for his son and got into the car and sped of whilst sticking his hand out the window flipping us off and screaming out profanities.
That cat has more culture than me
i love luigis fat cat dance
Don’t take me to time out !
Anyone want bread? 🥖 🍞 🥯
As soon as I saw the mom entered the story I thought this before you said it: She's a Karen ain't she
No the most evil thing is Mother Nature
Did the mother have the same haircut because it would  fit

Bro I was just drinking my “starry” (which I basically just sprite) and illy just hits me with the “Don’t play pretend w/ guns or I’ll throw you into time out” and I laught hella hard for no reason
You should've slapped karen right where she stood and told her to grow the fuck up with her gun priviledges
Plays pretend guns infront of mrs alyssa
You’re making me wanna play with guns Do you know what I want to time out😢
*Casually plays with pretend guns* 😈😈😈
Don't play real guns either or you'll get more then time-out
I hate polooshun
pew pew🔫
Uggggh, yes, the parents!! I work in a preschool, and BOY HOWDY do some parents make me feel sorry for those kiddos.
YOULL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA *tried to shoot her with block gun*
"starts playing pretend guns"
can someone else agree that when they were little they thought that 20 was the age for being an adult
Uhhh I make cardboard guns and play with them yeahhhh I might be going to time out Alcatraz (I might have spelled that wrong)
0:06 Gon is in the back!
Have you guys noticed the little anime references
a huge reason why it's bad for six year olds to like play guns is because if they live in America, that could be a habit in adulthood. but it won't be playing
illy is the sweetest person on the outside
*pew pew*
I love your videos😊
1:20 Luigi krumping still lives in muy memory all these years after I watched this video when it came out 😍🥰
My little brother who would 3 has his own gun 😊

The fact that there was a Shrek doll 😂  Edits: the captions didn’t listen to your “Why I Don’t Use My Real Name” vid 💀

5:45 I know childen shouldn't grow up pretending that they're shooting their friends but SHE HAS A POINT THERE. It's probably not healthy to grow up like this but still...
Delaney is Sunny from wings of fire.      *change my mind*

IM PLAYINGWITH GUNS
When I found out about pollution, I almost threw a pencil at the wall IN ALL MY STRENGTH
I love Luigi just dancing in the back
Luigi just dancing in the back
Water guns?
guns are boring anyway, they completely dominated the weapon meta to the point where all the COOL weapons are obsolete, to the point where using them nowadays is called HISTORICAL MARTIAL ARTS. he deserved time out /j /lh  I hear so much that kids are awful, my 75% sure I'm autistic-butt was fully convinced you were being sarcastic until you didn't say 'or so I thought it would be like' after mentioning how they all hugged you. I'm super glad your experience was so great though!!! I would've had a mini-breakdown with Karen tho ;w; lmao
Wait "almost an adult" ?!?! U we're 19 idk if its difrent were u live but ur an adult when ur 18
1:04 Most characters need to have a short person inside. I'm 5'47'' and saw smaller people than me doing these stuff   :)
wtf is bo in to
Unpopular opinion: I never like yellow as a kid.
Pew pew
Pew pew
“What’s wrong with guns?”   MAAM THIS ISNT THE WILD WEST
The kid you had the gun was a terrorist
I mean when it comes to that kid i think he should have been told that using these things on people isn't cool. They are supposed to be for self defense and aren't toys. Believe it or not for a long time kids would play with toy guns and play a game called war. The problems started when video games became a thing and parents just let the kids play them without explaining how the object isn't a toy or for fun and what happens on a video game should never be done in real life under any circumstances.
plz do not send me to time out😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Let me guess karen was the type to put guns into every conversation?
People who act like 'Karen' are a potential liability to the gun rights movement because they give other lawful gun-owners a bad reputation.
I found a loophole. I'm gonna play real guns
Honestly i get why “karen” was p!ssed but still she was kind of a jerk
W bo
illymation uploaded,, Very cute animation!! 😭💕💖🍼🧸

I work at a school and trying to stop kids from playing pretend guns is like wrangling a sea of yowling cats.
I love your videos
My mom doesn’t believe that co2 emissions exist so I’m all for that kid going off on global warming I just wish people actually believed in it
2:51 that picture is from kurzgesagt
me thinking devon grew up to be like a karen
in kindergarten, i would always secretly eat spicy peppers to be funny, and i remember one time i ate a pepper that had a lot of Scoville heat units... my mouth was aflame the entire day ;-;
DEVIN FOR THE WIN! That's the spirit!
Ohh u wouldn’t handle me I literally made a freaking online store and sold toys that u had and sold it then I bought the toys back and still made profit while other Childers were  playing pretend 😂 ( I made a online store at the age of 10 and made 400€ profit a month 😂) u got a great Chanel keep it up❤
I always preferred pretending to kill pretend enemy’s with magic or daggers or swords or cutting them in half with portal powers ooor using water powers do completely drye out there body! And when I got older controlling minds by controlling the smal electric pulses that goes through our brains!!!
at 6:13, illy looked like she just witnessed the birth and end of the universe XD
The cut to the mirror fucking killed me
HI!! i have just discoverd u at like 10:30 in the night (it is now 11:00 that i'm writing this), and I LOVE UR VIDEOS!! you are really cool, unique, and your drawing are spectaular! Also I love how u make ur videos, because it is relatable which makes me want to watch more of ur videos!! so here from a small country called New Zealand, a girl called Nadia.A Aprroveas your videos to be a middle of the night watch worthy!!! (that's me btw) :))
oh god idk about y'all but personally I am death afraid of guns. phobia. I get a panic attack. why would this kid be obsessed with guns? like sure but it was the game that mattered. the role, not just kill kill guns. very well said, "Ma'am this is a child"
what if karens name is really KAREN
7:26 OK OK I GET IT!
that kid is for sure gonna be a threat when he’s older 😭 playing guns at school?! we all know whats gonna happen next
Ur videos are mid
Who said pretend gun's
trust me, i have a MILLION boys in gr 1 in my school that r like bo. ☠
How did I guess she was gonna call her Karen 💀
Pew pew
Bro, when Devin went on a rant about how bad plastic is that was amazing!
here's this pillow, pretend it's a gun and I'm gonna rob you
the reference's
“THIS IS A ROBBERY” “That’s a-“ “Did I stutter”
Ms. Sheriff seems like the one adult all the kids like and are friends with-
Yeah they didn’t allow the kids to play guns in the kindergarten I worked at either. If they used sticks they would confiscate then if the kids pretended they were guns. They were allowed to play with water pistols sometimes tho. And once they were learning history about the world war and other historical things. They were made to pretend to be nazis. With guns. And symbols on their clothes. I was surprised at how they also had a grown up act as hitler and they even showed that hitler killed himself. Fun times..
" As soon as you walked in, she- "No..." "Yeah..." No!!!" "Yeah!!!!!" " ✨It's not a mistake, it's a masterpiece✨
The gun story was like what I witnessed in Wings of Fire book 1 prologue with the most gruesome death I read about. I only read about cats fighting each other because of territory, not dragons using whatever they got to kill others. I am on the sixth book and I now wished it was a little like the Warriors books because I can see why the cats would fight each other. Not a war that could have just been fixed with the three Sandwing sisters just finding a way to share the kingdom. If you want to read the stories I will not spoil it for you but get ready for a lot of gore and blood in the books.
Does my heart happy that Ms. Sheriff runs a tight but fun shift. Clearly Karen wasn't about to berate Ms. Sheriff perhaps she tried but the woman must run a really good program if Karen didn't want talk her son out of it for such a disagreement. I love kids they are so fun, full of wonder and just little sponges...which can also be a bad thing depending on what they soak up, but that isn't their fault....looking at you bad parents.

The fact that in the us people have to worry about kids playing with imaginary guns says a lot about the country
Subtitles didn’t know how to spell bo😂
Is no one gonna mention that ms sheriff looks exactly like percy king from epithet erased
who needs to pretend playing guns XD
To be honest, I would like to have a job like yours when I’ll be an unemployed 19-year-old untill I’m ready with college, and I’ll try to be the nicest to the kids, because when I was in kindergarden, my main “teacher” was so nice, but my sub… she was like the devil herself. That woman literally grabbed me by my T-shirt and told me to never bring a toy ever again. I was 5, miss ma’am. Ofcourse I brought it again, because yes, I was lowkey affraid of her, but at the end of the day I didn’t care. And I will be a good “teacher” because I know how it feels to have an amazing one, and a goofy one.
ok. play real guns instead.
it's so cute that there are little anime people or objects from anime
Hi 1:20
When I was 4 my dad ask what sound does a  deer make and I said bang
Well to bad my dad owns 10 guns I’m 13 yes I shot them
Nerf Nerf, Nerf, Nerf, Nerf, Nerf Nerf, Nerf, Nerf Nerf, or nothing. What about Nerf guns
Honestly the gun kid just sounds like someone with undiagnosed autism and guns were his special interest. Reminds me of myself in school where I had to make everything about mine.  His mother needed some parenting lessons or something though.
I hope devin become a poltician
It says a lot that the hardest part of working with kids are the parents
Karen:yes why was my son in time out and what do you mean by that well why not it's just pretend it's not real why what's wrong with guns 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
What about a bb gun
*plays pretend guns-*
5:26 TELL ME WHY SHE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE CATHY FROM DANCE MOMS 💀

In the one part
Karen 🚨
I interned this week for a daycare in my city. And there was 1 guy who we can call Eric. Eric was a very uhm... Not so kind kid.. He came in pretty late pretty close to lunch when we had the kids outside. It was a snow day and I was pushing some kids on the swings. Ge sat down on one and wanted to get pushed too so I did that. He was really rude and screamed to get more when I was pushing some other kids who had slowed down and some kids wanted to get off. Then when it was time to get them inside He throws a snowball on me. First one was pretty small and soft so I just told him no. Then he grabs another one. This one he holds for a long time wich makes it into ice and that one hurt a lot. So I told him to stop and he laughs and throws a broom into a snow pile telling me to go and get it. So I did because I felt too tired to argue and I was too scared to tell my supervisor since I was really shy and knowing how much of a monster parents can be i stayed quiet. Now jokes on me i catched a cold and have a fever. Wich I hope will stop until I go on vacation abroad next week. But I should get better lmao.
KAREN
ok beau is my real name and he also look like me like what is this ilymation
Why did the little kid say at start that shes almost an adult when she was already an adult for a year?? After youre eighteen you are an adult not a kid anymore!
Eeuuggghh. Ok, i wont play guns. I can't go back to time out!
1:35 Delaney, lol my friend’s name is Delaney and she is the complete opposite of your version

Today,at school,we were told to empty our bottles into a bucket,because when we go to the bus,some students spray water on others.We all emptied our bottles.All except one - me.Then Mam told me not to empty my bottle into the bucket,which,by the way,had a cockroch inside it.When I reached the bus,I saw that others also had their water.
I am like Deven.
"oh..... so your almost an adult."  HAD ME ON THE FLOORRRRR
Ok 7:33
Why is there an belgium flag on your pc

I think I saw the laptop I think I saw Demon slayer sickers Sorry if I gave something away on my supposed
Ok who here thinks that Illy would be a great teacher  Also love the Anime references lol THERE IS ALOT
WHat if hear me out what if he used a nerf gun or water gun
2:41 I respect this kid!
I saw that Demon Slayer sticker.
Imagine if that mother's real name is Karen xD
Can we just sit here and respect how she put *so many* references to find. It made my day ✨🥹
question but was the person taking a picture with goofy nagisa from assassination classroom?
I think Disney will be pissed off, but great video!
Please don't send me to time out
Noooo yessss noooo really got me laughing non stop
Love ur vids!
Did she say that people her age think that global warming is a myth WHATTTTTTTTT?
“Don’t play pretend guns or I will send you to time out!” Had me bursting out laughing every time I watched it but this time I didn’t because I had a drink in my mouth so I couldn’t laugh but yeah.
You have a child in the playroom named Sofia
i had a teacher kinda like you in 2018-2019 when i was in 5th grade. she even had red hair
Don't worry I never played pretend guns With graphic things Under the age of 10. :D
My dad plays gun games
Bruh
Omuhgow gurl well done you have made kids proud to see a adult       Maybe you are like THE KID WHISPERER (lol) Yeah that sounds good that should be your nickname for when you are being a teacher for some whatever reason
123ABC🥳
I love trying to find all the references in her videos.
Reasons why I don’t wanna be a pre school teacher: THE KAREN MOTHERS 😭
No
OH NO NOT THE TIME OUT I HAVE TO JUMP OFF A CLIFFF TO ESCAPE THIS!
Don't worry I won't play pretend guns I will use "REAL" guns which are different
:)
the most "violent" my pretend play got as a kid was when I convinced myself bulldog (hide and seek + tag for anyone who doesn't call it that) was a life and death situation and I took it really seriously like full fight or flight because apparently when you're a kid wanting really bad to win at something means you will literally be murdered if you loose
I'm a 5th grader please let me play guns I only play it once a month🤣😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣😀😀
Ya people like that Karen should not have a gun.
I’m a 2nd grader and I right killing story’s with YouTubers and my parents know about it and they do nothing
As a 10 year old I forget that was once a 9 year old
R2 D2 47. No other context
Illy you forgot about……….. 🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸FREEDOM🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅 „eagle screeching“
I'm convinced that almost all animators used to be teachers 💀
i just realised i was a pretty inappropriate kid :D i would be pretend murdering dead animals i found and i would always make my dolls kidnap and murder each other ;-;  i swear i was in an amazing houshold with caring parents i just overheard my mums murder documentaries -∖(ツ) ∕ -
I love ur vids there funny and cool
"whats wrong with guns?"  ever heard of a chruch? you NEED it.
What about real guns? **Takes out a pistol** IM TAKING PRETEND TO A NEXT LEVE-
Nu Tim ut in un abolth ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Omg Koro-Sensei
The funny thing is, the second she said “Thats when the mom enters the story, and I’ll call her-“ I said Karen in unison with Illyssa 😂
4:21 I JUST NOTICED THE ADORABLE MHA DRAWINGSS AHH I LOVE THEM ESPECIALLY THE TOUYA KEIGO ONEE <33
I have a friend from texas and the stereotype is real he literally says his 6 year old cousin had a training gun
I grew up in a gun toting family and I played pretend guns. Pretend play with guns is ok. ONLY wanting pretend play with guns is a red flag. It's not even the guns, it's how he played with them. If you always want to be the bad guy and hurt others instead of saving the day once in a while... You might need to talk to a professional.  It goes without saying but it's people like Karen who gives gun owners a bad name. This story has nothing to do with gun rights🤷  Also, lol at R2-D2 47 😆
You slayy
I love the fact she said "The Kids are Alright" my mind Immediately went to the song by the offspring "The kids aren't alright" (banger song btw)
At 4:35 you see koro sensi on calendar
You know when i was a kid half way throw 3rd grade i got threatened by karens yelled at by karens and the nail of the coffin a karen yelled at my friend and when my teacher said “oh your FRIEND here was HELPING and erased the board” yeah yell to nice
0:23 its a me luigi

Pew pew.     - - -🔫
I really love animation vids, I also loved the anime stickers on your animated computer I love to see those types of touches in animation vids
I’m never fudging watching your videos they curse
Delaney reminds me of Mabel from gravity falls
No but I love how Luigi was dancing in the background. Such a silly little cat with a mustache. No I started laughing so hard because for some reason that dance was really funny to me 😭😭
Ok I love the hawks plashy at 3:17 and the other anima plashes
Y'know I never realized how much Disneyland is mentioned on youtube until I watched youtube on a trip to Disneyland
Jesus
Ui
I stared shooting REAL GUNS when I was 4 or 5
Your scenario with miss Karen remind me of when me and my two siblings was playing in this cool indoor trampoline place it had this dogeball arena but with trampoline so we are playing in there and I hit this one kid with ball (the dodgeball are made of foam btw) the kid get upset and leave I give any mind to it so I just continue playing then this kid comes back 3 times with one of each of his family members his brother, his father, and his mother. now his brother and father are chill and are understanding of where we are playing in and just tell me to go a little easier on the little one but his mom just start yell at me  for hitting his son with a dodgeball and I haven't seen kid after he went to get his brother and father to talk to me and I was standing there in complete shock and like bruh do you where we are playing right now that cause this to happen Then she started say curse word and saying that I'm trash and she'll take me down when I'm taller than her and then two employees came over to tell her to clam down but she did not do that and then pushes one of employee she then got kick out with the family obviously. That moment still make wonder if she was having a bad day or something but it was weird
2021
Can you tell me the million bad things you know about the world?
My classmate/friend is expelled for just talking about guns
I saw all those references (ladie&Mazz)

Global warming is a myth
MY CAT IS NAMED LUIGI TOO!!! AND HE HAS MARKS THAT LOOK LIKE A MOUSTACHE!

IM NOT GOING BACK TO TIMEOUT 🫵🏻
“Oh so ur almost an adult” 💀
Illy:"Don't play Pretend Guns or I'll send you to timeout." Krinkels:" Well shoot, looks like we have to play real guns!"
Can I play pretend swords?
6:05     "Ma'am this is a child"

Gun culture in america is so weird
Everyone talks about how Illy references Owl House, but nobody talks about the FMA(B) and Attack on Titan references at 1:15
"miss illy, how old are you?"  "I'm nineteen years old."  "oh, so you're _almost_ an adult."  "wha-" º-º'  I laughed so hard at that XD
Omg goOoOn 0:06 :3
NO. YEAH. NO. YEAH
Really wish people could discuss political issues without boiling down any side of the argument to the craziest and loudest version. The woman you encountered does not represent all sport shooting enthusiasts. We are actually very level headed,  and willing to have conversations as long as things are kept respectful. Unfortunately, the worst of any group tends to be the most visible and the most vocal because the rest of us are too busy living normal lives and having regular interactions with people without trying to show them our pocket constitution. Give people with conflicting ideas of politics a chance and remember that to them, you may seem unreasonable. The best way to combat that is to be understanding and listen without being condescending or close minded.
4:21 look in the corner
Luigi be jamming out 😎
I love this video 😀✅😍 and I love cats and I have a cat smokey
Her cat just dancing lol

Wait that kore sassine
Haha lil nagisa

Jesus loves you
I don’t personally have a problem with kids playing with guns but I totally get why it could be a problem with a group of young kids. Also stories about Karens are just funny in my opinion; while not funny to deal with I’m sure.
3:24 - 3:53 kid sounds like me 😂
I am at eight-year-old and I’m in third grade so don’t try it
Me: finishes video Also me: *proceeds to play pretend guns for the luls*
There’s nothing wrong with guns, just the way you use them, or you pretend to use them. Kids at my school used to make tanks using Legos, but they never went and Pretended to blow up a school with it. Usually they just battled imaginary super villains.

Dang....that was almost a W mom until she changed her opinion.
Not the dreaded deadly R2D2-47!!!
When she said “what’s wrong with guns. You should’ve said…       Ma’am do you know how many school shootings there’s been since 1999?
Are finger guns allowed Miss illy?
Pew Pew
Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnssssssssss
I've subscribed to illy motion and haminations
I won’t pretend I will do guns            Not really it’s a joke
When Karen enters, u can see Moro senses from assassination classroom on the wall
pew pew..
18 and up is a adult
I'm a 9-year-old I'm almost 10 literally I can literally play guns whenever I want plus you can't send me the time out you're 19 year old how old do you think you are 34
You know I have a little DB
yo jo jo and ice fire dude from anime why are you here lol
"What's wrong with fake guns?" "Are you still in 1st grade with YOUR SON?"
Illy would be a great teacher
Can we talk about at 4:21 you can see Mha characters if u pause it
Why do I see Naruto and assassination classroom
is it me or im just finding different anime characters and logos litterally everytime i watch her videos
The last story i kinda ridiculous. Unless he was hitting/pushing kids, it really shouldn't have been a problem.  Definitely not worth chewing out the teacher for it, but it's still stupid that schools are making "playing guns" so reprimandable. If it's _that_ much of a concern, then ban all the FPS games too.  edit: Me and my friends spent a very large portion of our childhoods pretending to shoot, stab, decapitate, and break the necks of each other, and we (or at least the rest of my friends) ended up as well-rounded, morally wholesome people
*plays pretend guns*
NO MISS I WILL PWAY WHAT EVER I WANT YOU NOT BOSS OF ME >:(((
Or all the rest of the characters that are adults
At Disneyland you could be child Elsa or child Anna
You know  something is wrong when a kid  won't  get the apple juice and cheez-itz

One time a classmate got suspended for bringing a knife to school but I was late and so confused. This was also the classmate that was the troublemaker. Literally.
Love the cat dance
Dlany turns emo
gloablwarming is a myth tho
Hii Haminations
I’d be the kid pretending to die after can you shut up me
Did anyone see koro sensei

Do you have discord?
You sit in the big kid room with the big kid teacher with deku and kaachan and other anime staring!
1:20 😂 are you ok Luigi?
Pew pew
No..
Jaiden: No Colour James: No Clothes Maaz: No Eyes Rebecca: No Mouth Adam: No Choccy Milk Rush: No Hair Illy: NO GUNS
Beau sounds like me when I was a kid. Except that’s not my mom.  Wait… (timeout) NOO-
Yeah......that's how a kid can turn into a psychopath, "bang zoom pow, Koolaid everywhere" person in the future. And yeah, I do feel really bad for kids that are in homes like that. That is really confusing, especially for a 6 yr old😢
pew pew
luigi dancing made me giggle out loud. great detail!
Wait is that him and Asians I mean Hama nations I love your channel and I love this video and I’m just seven I don’t even know what I’m watching YouTube I should be watching YouTube kids but I don’t care
I want to wake up in the morning with hugs from tiny ppl :<
Who is the purple hair girl
“I hope she never loses that.” Me*thinking about me* I really hope she’s Dosent because I wa like her once and I lost all of my happiness
On the here for the chaos poster, I read here for the chads
What-was my teacher a YouTuber!?
YOU ARN’T USING REAL NAMES LAME! 😡. HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY PRETEND GUN IT’S JUST PRETEND! 😡.
ok
are you 20
Hear me out. what if the gun was real, would I still get sent to time out?
I didn’t really learn that stuff when I was five
Amazing video!!!
hmmm…pew- *gets slapped *
I thought she adopted luigi-
I can set out candles with my fingers
Her cat: *DANCE DANCE TILL YOUR DEAD DEAD DEAD DEAD*
OK I’m gonna say something my brother is well he was in kindergarten and he loves guns
I have  The big guns We used to have a dog that Bark every time would someone And from the driveway he would bark not how we would know you would know in every time he would see someone who would Bart or if he'd seen another dog he would bark at it and used to shoot like wait curse you like not at him bat him but right by his foot so so he wouldn't get hurt and he would think that he got hurt so yeah we do have a gun
I thought she was gonna be a karen
Lmao when I was in kindergarten I to watch gore in youtube and I used to make to make so war games whit clay or zombie games where zombies eat humans lmao
I love your animation I wanna draw like you
I did not get the time out
Did anyone notice the maaz doll
Pop off deven 🤭👐
The cat dance
Delaney is my spirt animal👌🏽
I.. Actually think that bo didn't do nothig bad. I mean.. maybe I'M the one that is weird, but.. I'm kinda used to that.  My uncle is a hunter, and my lil cousin of 5 years old have fun with shooting with REAL guns and skinning pigs.
:o that women that was "named karen" was so rude
I like violent imaginary games, but then again I'm eleven
😮😊
Bruh is no one talking about how she put assassin classroom in there ?? 😕😕 also she put anime in there :)
when i go to school we dont pretend to shoot our friends
At the preschool where I used to work, pretend water guns were okay while pretend "real" guns were not. The kids didn't question it. It was a solution that seemed to work for everyone.
Karen: The child was only pretending to play with guns and play games like threatening people and robbing them.. Me: Ma'am if you're child is only pretending to play with guns and play games like robbing and threatening other people theirs a 70% chance that he will grow up to be a serial killer or a THEIF
I remember the worst things about being a kid was being told not to pretend guns and not to play tag on the playground, this is probably why i am a libertarian
I’m thinking that when the kids are old enough to watch YouTube and see this, the could be like: “Look mom! Miss Illyssa made a video about me!”
Bow is like my brother, me and my cousin would be playing roleplay houses, and he would be the robber
Nice
The gun I think you're thinking about was an AK-47 because that's the closest gun that I could find to what you said
Well, technically you start acting like an adult at 18, and you physically become one at 21.
Public school in a nutshell for little kids is basically jail.
People only think global warming is a myth because they don't physically feel the difference in temperature.
Jesus when my dad was a kid you could bring a gun to school and as long as it wasn't loaded no one really cared
0:49 love the background and at 3:42 there was a Shrek doll
gun 👉🏽 pew pew
God bless all that see this
I tried to press the loke button but i ended up pressing on the hate button on accident😅
"To make that fat cat money" 💀
This is so weird! I just found your channel, and our lives are oddly similar. I live in Oklahoma though, Im 19 and just started working at an after school daycare and you are speaking truth!!!!
7:24 kids on their way to use real guns
Pov: You play pretend guns (Shows up at my house)
So random question, was there a pirate boat in the place in which the kids played? I say this because when I was little I went to a place like that and I feel like I said something like “almost an adult” and I think there was someone who would always play guns.
I ONLY PLAY NERF but I don’t have it and also me and my cousin broke the bullets except for one or two
boys in my class watching this vid be like 😨
Devin: do you know what the most evil thing in this world is?  Illy: and I said NO you know like a liar
"Pew pew pew IM ROBING THIS BANK"
Me seeing all might and hawks: yes
**pew** **pew** **shoots at teacher**
Bo: pulls out finger guns.  "I know what must be done but I don't know if I have the strength to do it."
I did the gun thing when I was 3
girl how u so talented-
*waving finger guns saying pewpew*
THIS IS A GUN 🟪 EVRYBODY REPLY ON THIS COMMENT OR I WILL SHOOT!
That cat got some moves
Cook about sorry I'm sitting my friend to find Nerf gun

I will not play pretend guns anymore😀
I hope one day one of these kids find this video and go OH MY GOD ITS HER
YOUR CAT PERSON
I have a cousin who always wanted to work at Disneyland it was her absolute dream. She ended up going to college near Disneyland and got to live her dream of working at Disneyland. She said it sucked.
“R2-D2 47 or whatever”-illymations
when i was 6 I had an arsenal of guns lol (toy guns)
1:09 minutes into the video and i see an assassination classroom reference :)
I'm 12 and I know pollution is the worst thing mankind ever did to Mother Nature.
She said that she's 19,meaning she an adult,as people at age 18 are considered adults.
knex gun
"R2D2-47" is apparently a way to say, "AK-47" without getting the ads taken away? Hmmmmm
I Will not play pretendgun
My one-year old's probably think the evilest thing on Earth is probably when I need to change their diaper before they eat snack
Hahaha
I mean bow
I like bo2
my names Delaney ❤
Wait what about  not presenting  like having a real gun (just joking)
I am not gonna lie but most people named mellisa work in Daycare most of the time they are directors but some times they are teacher not all the time tho.
When I was with my dad, he had his GUN SAFE in my closet. He also had a crossbow in arms reach from my bed.
I played pretend guns with friends when we were kids, at around 7-8 years old, it was never a bad thing but I'm from Europe and the whole gun culture doesn't exist here.
"I was 19, so almost an adult." Europeans: *visible confusion*
Her: DONT PLAY PRETEND GUN OR U WILL GO TO TIME OUT! Me: She never said anything about real guns. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
pew pew        **it’s a water gun**
“Mam this is a child”
You should’ve came to my elementary school people playing Nazi I’m sorry I’m sorry I was in first grade and they started playing this all the way to fifth like what
Bo is gonna grow up to be a pathological narcissist. Calling it now.  The mother is one.
HAWK'S

This was my first illymation video I watched.

I was very much like bo but much more...realistic yea definitlywasntthgunnerdwhohadafavoritegun
Did not pass the snack table, did not take the cheeze it’s  Did not pass go, did not collect 200 dollars...  Monopoly
It’s the fact that bo did it while illy was working with him knowing that she won’t know that he’s not allowed to do it🤣🤣🤣
Me who (as a Brit) wishes for the repeal of the 2nd US amendment: …..that Karen saying “What’s wrong with guns” ……Sandy hook……Columbine……many others
... should I just head to timeout
himynameisdelanieandidintknowwhatelseshesaid-
Pew pew
The little boy that likes to play water guns he could be autistic
"mam this is a child" LOL🤣🤣🤣
You know you're not selling the woman in your video but that's a boy's natural nature it's normal for little boys to be playing with guns and all that stuff and his thing I don't see any real problem with it and then normal for a little boy to do that I mean it's a little alarming but same time is it normal you know for a little boy you know for a little boy you know to you know look when I was a kid I was just the exact same way as he was playing with toy guns and all that yeah I grew up with that how he did I'll see him real problem with it I don't I don't see any real general problems I don't really see how it's wrong and now I'm not going to find a random guns right I mean I catch you if you're saying here he's 4 years old and he really shouldn't be thinking about that and also it's a South most of us that grew up in the south you hungry up on this you heard guns when you were growing up like you know had like a neighbor doing some of course okay look it's normal behavior and the boil mellow out in his teen years this is when scientifically shown that is a man's general natural nature to be violent let's say it's right I'm not saying it's right I'm just saying that's what a man in general nature is it's not say bye
And I’m thinking “Oh devin, I know a million horrible things about the world. SO TELL ME WHAT ON GODS GREEN EARTH DID YOU FIND OUT TODAY?”
I won't use wooden block now I will use A stone brick as a gun
Pov:kids: school is jail :teachers:school is not jail
Don't worry I won't pretend hee hee heh (joke)
I'm in the Midwest and I make rpp (Rubber band Propelled Projectiles) guns and my mom does not care unless it shoots something sharp
I’m not pretend guns  I’m  using real guns    This is a JOKE
To late I'm playing pretend guns RN
Are used to go to a daycare I loved it we would always go on field trips during the summertime and there was this one woman who was so nice and now I am thinking of working at daycare
Great video Illy!!! I love the you draw Karen so realistic
PEW PEW
My parents have always taught me to 'Always treat a gun like it's loaded' real or imaginary
YES MA’MA
Uwu
Ngl but my dad started teaching me how to hunt and shoot guns when I was 5 😬 but nothing gbas ever happened and I am a teen now and know how to shoot guns amazingly
OK 😭😡
Try me, *pew* *pew*
You can’t put me in timeout I may be younger than you by three years but I’m not six I am 16 and you’re 19 but still doesn’t make you the boss of me
Hi again! It's "delanie" and I just realized now that you mentioned me in the video! I'm happy to see your doing well. You were the best teacher ever and I'm most grateful that you treated us the way you did.  Edit: 104 LIKES- THIS IS THE MOST LIKES IVE GOTTEN
amagine if karen was the picky lady's real name🤣
Idk if any of you noticed but at 1:16 there are demon slayer jacket designs lol.
Kids are smart my little sister go's to school and she knows that the teacher can't do anything to her so she crys and bits and yells and gets to go home early and yes my mom does get mad but then forget about it but if it was me or my siblings we would have been dead can you tell who's the favorite child.
I love how Luigi is just causally just dancing in the background 😂😂😂😂😂
The things I needed to know were not available, like the concept of Narcissism at an encyclopedic level or Cognitive Dissonance at-length, just to understand that the information I receive won't be welcome-information when presented to my parents who were taught differently: imagine my horror of finding dinosaurs had plumage to my parents drunken-outrage at being told-that by their kid; or wondering why people can stop being terrifying to answer the phone sweetly then hang up and revert to terrorism again, it's not good or evil, its a narcissist.
Substitute teacher here... parents are almost universally insane
This is a child forgot the a
Yeah exactly that for me but yeah I would still say ma'am this is child
I just noticed all the ass class references EEEEEEEEEEEE
I'd meet dale
Can you trademark r2-d2-47
Dealing with Bo is why i want to be a teacher :)
Bro, Devon's gonna be the greatest future Environmental Activist in the world.  Meanwhile I'm just working a part-time job at the nearest Hornbacher's (they have great accommodations for people with mental illnesses and the like), slowly succumbing to my Social Anxiety while bagging people's groceries, hoping one day I get to be an actor or something. ...Sorry for projecting that.
I am 8 and you said no playing with guns right? Well you didn’t say threatening people😌😌😌😌
Hello
Luigi got some moves 😩
1:22 I can’t get over how she makes her cat dance 😭😭😭
NAGISAAAAAAAAAAQAAAAAAA                          nagisa at 1:09
my fav child is Bo I love water guns 😎💅
R2-D2 47 AHAHA
What about orbey guns
But I don’t wanna go in time out
Says the legend luigi is still dancing
I feel like Bo is the kid in the neighborhood with the massive beebee gun and shoots down every child on the playground.
Dang... almost an adult..
as someone who lives in a country where the large majority of people just.. dont own guns and theres not a ton of gun violence, since when is playing pretend with guns (toy or imaginary) innapropriate? o_o what about nerf or water guns? what about just.. ynow.. playing pretend.. like videogames, or action cartoons
I like cats
*Plays with guns*
Hello I'm Cleo I'm in year six could you give me some tips cuz I'm going to high school soon and I'm scared
Child: “How old are you?”  Illy: “I’m 19”  Child: “Oh, so you’re almost an adult.”  Me, 19: “Eh, adulthood is overrated”
0:29 “fAt cAt mOnEy” 😂😂
The drawing style of the mom made me go, That is a KAREN.
Me in kindergarden (and some friends) we folded paper to me them the shape of a gun. we were playing milsim with paper
I don’t get what’s wrong with playing guns
I grew up in a household were we had toy guns and stuff like that. I feel if this were to happen to me at that time we would just listen to what they said despite what we thought because toy guns or no guns the policy doesn’t go against any belief really so it’s just inconvenient and rude 😐
*plays pretend guns so i can see illymation*
I'm.  1111111111111111
illy: 'DON'T PLAY WITH GUNS!!' Me: What about gasoline and match-

6:05 when you realize that there are guns in video games made for kids
5:15 I can already see why you named her Karen
4:36 why is a assassins classroom plush there?— lol
Like me

Assassination classroom reference

Ok I think that cat is better dancer then me 😂
NOOOO NOT TIMEOUT
I- I played pretend guns 🥺
ah yes, "Karen" being a Karen
i live in nh and you cant even play guns in school
Ok ok I’ll stop playing with guns
I’m the child who said, “Oh, so you’re almost an adult,” Here is the explanation! So, when I was smol, I had the belief that 20 years old=adult.
🔫 PEW PEW 🔫
I think I’m with Karen on this one, you say he’s a child so he shouldn’t play gun? That’s literally the only time in your life you should play gun, the amount of violence there gonna be playing these days and you won’t let them play gun? That was and should be normal, get some men in charge see how they feel about it.
I think boe found out about the game doom
Love it
The cat danceing tho 😂😂
illymation Will Not Heart This Comment ( Idk Really But Yeah)
I played pretend guns put me in timeout

This is hilarious because I work at the daycare that I went to. I constantly tell my 4yo that we're not playing guns. But I am blessed that the parents like me.
OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD CANARY FROM HXH IS IN THE BEGINNING
You can't send me to time out because I don't play pretend guns, I PLAY WITH REAL GUNS. Jokes on you. 🤓
0:15 Whoa…That was COLD!
NoOoOoO I wIkE ak72
Omg 😳😂
her: don't play guns!!! Me: ok I'll USE fake guns
Play pretend with guns ... it afects gun violence just as much as videogames... dumb rules.
Honestly I don't know what the big deal is with kids playing with fictional fake guns I'm all about gun safety you know because when I was younger when I was around 5 got my gaming console and I got into action games I like the guns and I used to go to a daycare and they didn't like guns but we'd still find a way to sneak past the rule and I'm no terrorist or school shooter
Why is the background d music so good?
I'm 7 technically a kid
I love how Luigi is just dancing
I love how mrs,. Sharif had baby bakugo and deku and todoroik and dabi ⬅️*I forgot his real name*
AT THE END BE LIKE: DONT PLAY FAKE GUNS OR I WILL SEND YOU TO TIME OUT!       ME BE LIKE: OH. MY. GOD. WOW         LOL
FIRST HIS NAME WAS WILL NOW ITS BOAW
The black girl is literally so much alike to one of my characters, the fact that i didnt even knowed this channel when i created that character was..😭
i love how every time you show Luigi hes always dancing xD
My brother would have a year of time out cause he plays pretend guns, explosions, war, fighting, killing me with nurf guns, 😂 He has done this for a decade
“ Don’t play guns or else I’ll send you to time out” Me: CA CLICK KABOOM
Do you watch my hero academia?! Because if you do you do you are my best friend!😍
The moment she said "what's wrong with guns" I knew something was up, as if i didnt know from the name Karen.
if you were in the owl house and you were a witch I think you would look like willow ( I draw you as a witch in toh and you look just like willow lol)
so you are telling me that you are American and you don't like guns?!
"mam this is a child" killed me
I forgot to comment this a year ago, but is Miss Sheriff's bulletin board's pictures Deku, Bakugou, Kiego ( Hawks) and Dabi?
*when you think your delainy*
It's called beforeschool
Don’t worry illy, I won’t play with pretend guns
😂😂
My friends call me short so I guess we're in the same situation
So im watching this last part and i start playing with my nerf gun and have the most perfect aim. Am i being disrespectful? Also I'm 11...
I also rage against global warning
This is so cute!
Dancing cat 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It's ok ill play with real ones so I don't go to time out
0:16                          XDDDDDDDDD
All of the anime including all might toys is nice
Whats wrong with guns? ... illy: *Ma'm this is a child*
My mom is exactly like the Karen mom. She thinks Bill Gates controls the weather and that climate change isn't a thing. She's also homophobic and transphobic and when your trans and gay and have been since 11 it was hard living with her and it still is. But u didn't hear it from me so shhhh
This video got me curious about your height, as I am also quite short. So I decided to look it up. And different sites have different heights. I saw 5'6, 5'10, and "short".
What itadori Is on the back in the Beginning
Illy: don’t play pretend guns or I will send you to time out  Me:*play pretend with knives and scissors*
Nah I know people older then 19 that think global warming is a myth ;-;

Hi illy! I have a few questions  1. Do you like pokemon? 2.whats your favourite  video u made? 3.what is your dream country to live in?! Thank u if possible to answer!! :D
When you turn 18 you're an adult. But since you are 19 you are an adult. Cuz I am 31 I should know that.

I can agree with Devon because plastic is bad it hurts the earth and it makes me cry especially when you do it on purpose
When I was watching this I ate cheese-its
I don't care about Nerf guns I have them but I actually do have a BB gun and I'm 10 years old and I'm a girl I have a bow 🏹 I got it when I was 8 years
0:30 I love that Luigi dance :)
are nerf guns ok?
WTF
I use to play pretend guns and throw bombs and no one had a problem
lugi dancing 😫: 1:22
"sO TO MAKE THAT FAT CAT MONEY!"
Yeah it's not normal for a kid to be playing m^rdering their friends, I was raised in a *very* pro gun household and one of the rules was you never point a gun, pretend to point a gun, or mimic pointing a gun at something you do not intend to destroy, and you *never* do any of the above at a person (unless it is self defense)
Me when I was 6 *brings pretend gun* Me when I'm 8 brings a real gun die die everyone die shoots trigger ×_××_× ×_××_××_××_××_××_××_××_××_××_××_× ×_×_××_××_××_××_××_××_××_××_××_××_××_×
why is maaz from the ammaazing there at 3:40, btw love the work

I swear, Karen is probably the start of gun violence.
Psh, I’m not going to play PRETEND guns, (those are the type of people we DON’T want multiplying, we (Americans) don’t want people to grow up because criminals/ thief and/ or bad people working for the enemy, yes I/ we have an evil enemy and his name (who I don’t mind putting on blast) is Joe BIDEN) ohh nonononono, my am 22, and a little overdue for a REAL GUN (used probably, of course, only for self defense as a last resort and shooting guns at a guns range when I got a real guns and learn how to use it properly) (ohh and I have common sense)

how can you be a after school teacher in summer since there is n school in summer time
This is my first time seeing your channel, and just to say: I LOVE IT! I love your shading and art style! You are one of the small amount of people on youtube that make me happy and want to make me one of those "cool" youtubers. Thank you for making this channel!
Where there anime characters in the background😆
frrrrick. i'm so glad Sheriff was a good boss and listened to you. Karen is a dime a dozen. Just like the kids who scope the situation and rightly figure the new guy doesn't know the ropes (i think that's called beanbagging?  or something?  i forget the term when i was in after school care) i think the parent did the same thing. little do they both know... adults talk to each other
Missa lissa
i just realised illy is the only charecter with fingers
Every time I hear the beginning of this video I hear "Alright everyone, this is Missa Lissa." Is that just me?
my brothers dont play pretend guns they play w/  nerf guns and im the target ;(
how did dis girl know im 9
4:20 dude the deku and bakugou pic in the background makes me wanna cry
3:08 the little naruto plush in the background makes me smile
Child me: -picks up need gun and pretends to shoot people - you are and you are dead and you are dead! - laughs -
What kind of person uses any excuse to unload on a percieved subordinate for their own satisfaction? That's gotta be some kind of character flaw or psychosis there. "Yay! I get to yell!" Sick! :( there are words to describe this behavior, but i don't think i should repeat them here. Maybe they're just assholes... whoops O.O

Fun fact: fiddles are quite tricky to pick up and so, he didn't play you like a fiddle... he played you like... a cheep kazoo
This kid Bo is just like my brother, he is so freaking violent! Used to beat me up (He was 6) and loves playing army with guns...
My little sister is 4 and once she was playing Barbie’s and she was killing them!, but she has 3 other siblings so I’m not surprised 😅
So a fun little Britain game that I love to play when I was a little kid and even still I'm almost a teenager and I still love to play this game it's called Indians and Pilgrims basically the point of the game is two people or if two other people decide four people are Indians and then the rest are pilgrims why did we me and my cousins play this game like this it's because we knew a lot about the Indian tribes and pilgrims and we knew they were a whole lot more pilgrims than there were in that one Indian tribe That's why two girls and two boys would always play as the Indians and the rest of the boys since there was mostly boys there would be the pilgrims things that have changed as my cousin has gotten a little sister so now it's three girls and one boy whenever we play Indians and pilgrims and some of the other boys just like in real life in history didn't accept the Indians fun fact I always played as an Indian it was just more fun that way so did my cousin she's two months older than me and my little brother is always an Indian as well but some of the other things that happened anytime we played indians's we would go overboard when we play pretend our brains immediately switched to this is actually happening this is a real life occurrence so we would have Indian ages in the names we would make everything seem like we were actual Indians accept our clothing because none of us have fake Indian clothing and we would always manage to find some way to cause a war I'm joking me and anyone else would play Indians or always peaceful and usually we just stayed in the forest because there was a small little forest surrounding my cousins house now when she came to visit me we didn't have a forest cuz we live in the city but we did have a giant backyard so yeah also we had a playhouse fort a pond and this thing called a gazebo make believe and pretend can go overboard when you have the right amount of imagination juice as I call it
Its funny if you did our class as a Substitute you may hate us (6th grade), we are (well not all of us) are bad and real rude xD
My name is bow lol but I’m a girl lol

Wait a minute why was there the octopus from assassination classroom as a toy and many other anime Toys
I’m absolutely blaming miss sheriff  That bo played nerf guns!
Fam i played pretend guns and war all the time as a kid! Me and my “friends” at kindergarten used to play stick war! So we would basically throw sticks at each other! You can imagine how that went, I think we started off on teams but then all my teammates left and then i was the only one against three and I wanted to stop and then I got one right on the eyebrow and bled to my jaw 😃 we also used to use sticks as guns all the time in the woods and used them as swords, and we made guns out of Lego! And look at me now! I’m still pretty messed up but not in that way!
nobody: the cat: *vibes*
Luigi in the background
1:22 I think that’s what my cats thinking in her head XD
I work at a summer camp and there was a rule that if there were any angry parents try not to talk with them until you get to a supervisor so that stuff like this doesn’t happen as often
I also got those wtf moments with some people you just get like .exe stop working moments
soo we have toy guns but we use them in zombie apocalypse games to shoot zombies
The way the cat dances tho😂😂😂😂
1:09. Koro Sensei

Boe probably faced either a neglectful household where he’d play call of duty all day or worse.

Why does he hurry so much to get a gun? When he’s an adult, he can legally get a gun. Just make sure he doesn’t start threatening and killing people as an adult. I don’t think that he will start killing people. At least I really hope so.
illy: im 19 girl: oh so ur ALMOST an adult. 2022: 19 is adulthood, 18 is is too

If I were you I would find the crazy gun child woman's name just to call her out on the Internet, you have way more patience then me.
Don’t worry when I was a kid we never played pretend guns unless we were police officers and still we would never pretend to shoot we would just hold em like guns
Illy: don’t play pretend guns or I WILL send you to time out. Me: *plays pretend guns* heheh 😈
if anyone has a situation like that you should say something like "the problem is he's pretendind to shoot and kill other students if he was "shooting" at targets it wouldn't be a big issue but we don't want to promote violence in young people"  then you don't sound "anti-gun"
This makes me wonder why having kids is a right, I mean that kid is probably screwed for life thanks to Karen.

I do agree with guns given to the right people and taken away from the wrong people and I do agree that kids should be aloud to play guns but not playing kill my friends
That Devin guy is me if someone pulled the uno reverse card
Am I the only one who finds it ironic that the teacher was called ms sheriff and yet, said no playing pretend guns?😏
“Why was my son in timeout?!”  Me: what the fuck do you think Karen?

am i the only one that kept seeing assassination classroom refrences
The bubblewrap generation can't be allowed to play with toy guns, or they might end up being mass shooters. Oh wait, the bubblewrap generation has already been prohibited from playing with toy guns, and mass shootings are going UP.   Hmm..
Deven looks like you
Ok I won’t play pretend gun because I have a real sniper in my house so I will play real gun
I love the anime references like Assassination Classroom calendar
I literally have a cat named Luigi because all my cats have a Mario name
B-but- what happened next!??
Did anyone get the anime reference of the sticker on the computer I forgot what anime it was but it has green,yellow and pink
i was in the shop with my dad and his fiance. There was a kid around 4-5? and he has a small shopping cart. We were walking past him, but when it was my turn to walk, the kid hit me with the shopping cart, it was a hard hit aswell. Then, while we were at the cash register, the same child came and hit my step-mom harder then he hit me. He was doing it on purpose, and his mom did nothing about it, she just watched emotionlessly. so, Kids are pure evil, nothing can change my mind.
I played pretend guns, you haven't teleported me to the big kids room yet.

Did anybody else see the assassination classroom reference 1:09
I worked at a day camp for kids going into Kindergarten. There was one kid who frequently talking about destroying everyone and graphically described how he would do so (As graphic as a five year old can describe a massacre) laughing like a villain. Even though he was only five, it was genuinely a little frightening to hear this future mass murderer talk. Only on the day he got kicked out of camp did he seem to understand that he was in trouble.

When illy was talking luigi next to her dancing I just couldnt! It was so funny😂
*THIS PLACE SEEMS AWESOME!!*
I mean, I could get the thing about guns as like a teenager, but A 6-YEAR-OLD!? that is absurd.
Everyone: Watching the video Me: DAMN LUIGI BE GIVING SOME GOOD MOVES 😎
I can’t believe they let a student worker/assistant take the brunt of a parent’s anger like that :( At the nursery where I work, all complaints are fielded by a manager or fully qualified member of staff, so teenagers aren’t put on the spot like you were.
I work at the elementary school I went to as a kid and I'm also 19, and so seeing this is pretty right on the money. I love the job so much, even though there's some less fun parts about it, but getting to interact with the kids and talk to them and all that makes it really worth it! It's a neat experience.
the mutiple anime references is killing me!
Okay, I won’t play with pretend guns *loads m1911*
yo built like a splatoon character
You are 19?
She's right fire arms are awesome, and also what about nerf?
As a tutor I can relate
When she talks about the cat the cat is like DANCE TILL YOUR DEAD DEAD🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
*illy not liking kids with guns* me who shot my first gun at 4
yeah, obviously that parent saw you as younger and insignificant and tried to assert her two-faced dominance. she must work in management. (because borderline psychopathic people shit on subordinates and suck up to whomever just for that sweet sweet dollar bill that's a replacement for their self-worth, paying minimum wage and collecting big bonuses when the company goes bankrupt)
I played only star wars, back to the future and indiana jones as a kid. (at age 7)
🔫 pew pew
hope i don't get in timeout for the real thing...
Alright, I won't pretend guns.         I'll just do the real thing.
Ok ok. I won't pretend guns. I will real guns.
Someone needs to name all the references in this video
7:23 but... The lads need me on Sniper.
pew pew pew
This little boy in preschool, he's 5. He's obsessed with FNAF, Among Us, and Poppy Playtime. One time he drew himself as an imposter and his friend as a crewmate. This would be okay, if he hadn't drawn himself KILLING his friend. Blood and everything. He will constantly ask me to play among us with him, or draw him a fnaf character, but one time I asked him a question and he told me his parents don't allow him to play these games or watch videos like them. I try telling him not to play those sort of games because it's inappropriate for school, but he just tells me "oh, well its just a game." Keep in mind, I'm not a teacher. I'm just a student aid, I come in to help with those kids for an hour every single day. I personally feel like its not my place to punish these kids. I will give them a warning before telling one of the actual teachers, or step in when one of the kids were crying or something, but because I don't have to deal with them for hours at a time, I don't boss these kids around. I'm just in there to play with them for 15 minutes, make sure they clean up after their play time, and help out with their activities, like practicing their letters and numbers, or making sure they're following directions.

I was a Bo. He was probably exposed to gangster and war movies at a young age, he’ll be fine it’ll eventually manifest itself as a sense of ferocious loyalty and family with those closest to him. Well… assuming he wasn’t corrupted by his Karen of a mom.
I'm from the south myself. I'm all for my amendment rights, including the second and especially the first. However, I also agree that some things just aren't appropriate, especially for children. Gun play among other things is seen, at least in my eyes, as harassment and threatening. If a kid in one of my classes did that to me growing up, I wouldn't feel safe because I'd register it as that they want to kill me. I mean, the mom's right, it isn't a real gun, but imagine the moment he's given a real gun. Is he still going to think it's a game? Is he going to realize how messed up he is, seeing his friends laying in front of him, bleeding out? Graphic, yes, but also important to understand that what you teach kids at a young age is important. You could still teach your kids about guns, but also to teach them that it isn't right to pretend to hold a gun up to another kid's head or use it to kill off all the toys they were playing with.
I'm from Texas that is in the south and the kid playing with water guns is not a normal student
Honestly I wouldn’t have a problem with it but if it was that obnoxious I guess it makes sense to timeout him 🤷‍♂️
Im a rootin tootin cowby shooter lovin freak, all the six shootera and lever actions and shotguns galore lovin man. I love modern, vintage and antique firearms! You know what I think? That is not the kind of "play" a kid should do. Sure, playing soldier or army man is one thing, but specifically fovusing on using pretend guns to terrorize pretend families? That is not a good omen.
Fun fact my grandmas dog is named bo
"It's just pretend it's not real" that's how children turn out to be murderers-
I love how this day care has a chemistry corner and a Pokémon mural
wait what
Are we not gonna talk about what drug Luigi is on?
Nah, we always played pretend guns. Was called "Cops 'n Robbers" or "Cowboys 'n Indians" in the way back times. It's pretend. Not sure why there's an issue. We upgraded to tag/hide and seek when we found out we could tackle each other and not get in trouble (as long as no one was hurt). It was also because constant arguments of "I hit you/no you didn't!" got old. Long discussions on how to play hard enough to have fun but soft enough to not leave scratches went from the parents' responsibility to each other. We did a lot of "okay, so we want to do X, but we can't get hurt or let the parents find out. How do?" Then we got airsoft guns. Ooooh, there was no "you missed me!" with those things. Well, until you toughen up enough to ignore the automatic 80FPS gun's pellets in order to hit your cousin with your single-action 150FPS pellets from 5 feet away. Hahahhaa.  But no, the kid was told not to and did anyway. He also injected himself into other's games and messed them up. Those were the problem.
Pretty much Bo was pretty much me i got a gun in 4th grade I knew everything in preschool I was on a streak of getting in trouble for plus using guns
Why is there *H A W K S* and *ALL MIGHT*
I mean, i am western Slavic and where i am from pretending to play guns is absolutely normal. No one bats an eye, it's just pretend! Many kids here are into wars, war machinery and weapons, and a lot of them later in life become mechanics, historians or soldiers. Hell, i myself played this type of pretend and i am a girl. My group used to pretend we are in the trenches waiting for an enemy to strike at us. Casual stuff.  And before you say anything about how condoning this play-pretend could cause violent behavior in the future, my country has almost no serious shooting incidents, the last one was like 6 years ago (which was at the hands of a mentally ill man).
i couldn't have lived like that lol I was much worse at his age.
When I was younger, I didn't play pretend with guns, thankfully  I pretended to bury bodies in amazing world with my older sister, god bless those days <3
I have to say, I ... would need to know more about what Bo was actually doing to make this a problem before I could agree that things are as "bad" as presented. I kind-of agree with "Karen," here: it's just pretend. Now, we have your side of the story, telling us that she went off on a random rant about second amendment rights, but unfortunately, I have seen enough of these kinds of altercations to have to reserve judgment. It sounds pretty extreme to go off like that, and there are fools who will do so, but there are also perfectly reasonable people who will get portrayed as such fools when you only hear the other side of the story.  ...that said, the 180 shift when Ms. Sherriff comes in is absolutely a sign that she's a disingenuous twit. >_<  And, frankly, if it's JUST that he's playing "guns" and "bad guy," that doesn't sound like a problem to me. If he's actually disrupting other kids' games (as is implied, but not explicitly stated, in the story), then THAT behavior needs to be curtailed. But by focusing on the "gun" aspect of the imaginary play, you stigmatize "guns" as the sole problem, leaving the actual bad behavior as a-ok if he can figure out a way to do that without guns.  You want Bo to stop pointing guns at his classmates? Get him gun safety training. I guarantee you that the grown-ups teaching such classes will instill trigger discipline and the proper respect for firearms that he is not showing. And it will be far more effective than "guns are bad, and children can't know anything about them" taboo-training.    All of that said? When I was a kid, my dinosaurs flipped over to become laser guns all the time. My triceratops's horns could generate force fields to block them. I built space ships out of blocks that had all sorts of weapons, and the cylindrical blocks were hand-held phasers (I was a trek nerd even back then). And I don't even own a gun, today. They're more trouble to maintain and practice with than they're worth to me, as I thankfully don't live in a dangerous area. I probably _should_ train with at least a handgun and get a concealed carry permit, but I just can't be bothered.  So, no, playing with pretend guns as a kid is not a dangerous thing. At all.  Disrupting other kids' playtime by taking it over and ruining their games IS bad behavior, however, and should be stopped.
'ma'am this is a child...' this one got me
Poor Devin. He's too young to be worrying about that, especially since what he was fuming about was largely untrue or exaggerated. Unless, of course, you're telling stories from your time taking care of these kids in China. :(  Somebody needs a talking-to about what they're filling impressionable kids' heads with.  Anthropogenic global warming isn't a myth; it's a hoax. The climate all over the planet is changing all the time, has been since long, long before the industrial revolution, has been since long before we think anthro- existed on the planet to create anthropogenic _anything._ And actual science - as opposed to carefully cherry-picked data that uses different methods RIGHT AROUND when it shows changes happening - demonstrates that it has not accelerated nor slowed down since the start of the industrial era.   Moreover, the last warming period led to enormous prosperity in Europe and Asia (we have no records for the Americas or Africa) as farmland became more prosperous and there were even vinyards in northern England.  So, if you believe that man is causing the world to end, you, too, are a victim of lies.   We can and should be careful about litter, and cleaning up pollution is a good thing. But it isn't the crisis that it's made out to be, and we certainly shouldn't be curtailing human lives and advancement to accommodate unrealistic and unnecessary eco-goals. They generally lead to MORE environmental destruction, anyway.
Loogi
It would be so cool to go back to your old school to be a teacher, Idk why but I would feel superior
*pew pew 🔫* “All hands an knees on the floor now and give me ur wallets” * pew pew*
Ahhh yes anime assassin classroom :3
Lol i love how ur cat is dancing while you're talking
Don’t worry *i shoot real guns instead*
6:05
I never understood why having a gun was a COMMANDMENT! Like I don’t really know about American history but the commandments seem to be more then just laws. In some places it’s illegal to own guns ( without a license and permitted use ) in America there’s a whole commandment about it!?
Plot twist:Karen is her real name
"global  warming is a myth" bro even here in norway it snows noticably less
Guns aren't toys. They can be used as toys in ONLY THE APPROPRIATE SETTING AND A SAFE MANNER.  Proper gun safety isn't a joke. Accidental deaths happen in the hundreds every year because people keep their nose hooks on the bang button when they are emptying it.  Kids NEED to learn proper handling and safety young. Even if they aren't going to be around them. It's a safety thing.
??? Ok?????????????
why are people allowed to have guns? they are just harmful and make no good for society. in my opinion, only police and military should be allowed to have lethal weapons. the normal civilans can just have tasers.
1:38 you have described every single 5 to 6yo in existance.
"oh, so you're ALMOST an adult." me, who lives in a country where you become a legal adult at 18 and get to do everything(drive, drink, make kids, etc): i dont have such weakneses.
Yes
A2D2-47 is what got me laughing
Whelp. Sorry you got chewed out by a Karen...but that pretend gun rule is so weird.
The animation itself Deserves a subscription from me
Play real guns, got it.
Imagine if that one kid who was speed while introducing themselves was watching this video
*laughs in videogames with guns*
Bruh just let the boy pretend he's got a gun, whats wrong with you
That is disturbing, I’m all for guns and the 2nd amendment, but that is disturbing behavior for a child, if it was an adult it would be disturbing as well.   This kid is romanticizing gun violence on a consistent basis and his mother doesn’t seem to discourage his behavior, what’s gonna happen when he’s an adult?
well i don't pretend to use gun's i use real gun's
Lol I got put in time out as a kid for playing Rock Paper Scissors Cuz apparently that was a game they encouraged violence
Kid: so you’re ALMOST an adult Me and other people in the uk: I am 18 parallel universes ahead of you
6:00 Teacher is in the wrong here.
Pew pew pew 🔫, oh no
did you know a lot of sports started off as a simulation for war, or as a simulation for hunting. Kids and adults can play them alike because it's not real or inappropriate. As I see it, you're the Karen for making a big deal out of nothing.
I mean, i used to play call of duty when I was 3  Note: it was installed into my dad's computer so I just opened the game and played it
There is nothing wrong with kids playing with imaginary guns. The idea that toy guns lead to real violent behavior is the same as the idea that violent video games cause violence, it's just not true. I played guns all the time growing up and have never actually hurt anyone. My friends and I all loved playing these games at 6 and not one of us have hurt anyone since. I still play guns, airsoft has been a very fun hobby for me since I was 12. Today I have a few guns and enjoy using them at the range but would never, ever, even think about pointing one at anybody! "Karen" was out of line with the way she spoke to you and she seems like she might not have been a very good parent, but playing guns was not the cause of that. TL;DR: Video games and make believe don't cause violence.
0:06 CANARY!? But she does not go to school
bu bu but I like toy guns...
I agree with guns shouldn't be taken away, But kid shouldn't act like guns and killing is cool because they are dumb and learn from that.
After rewatching this YOU YOU ARE THE REASON that is all
i used to play "soldier" in sunday school with blocks and sticks( or really anything remotely gun shaped i destinctly remember having my parents called because i turned a capri sun into a gun like object) and me and my friends would pretend to have little wars with each other and sometimes we would go ruin the girls house or whatever they were playing but honestly i think that just comes from like being boys and living in the south
¡BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLA-! Oh, now I'm in kid jail :(
All fun and games until he stops pretending
A teacher at 19? Damn
This is like independent PBS Kids I love it
I work with kids for my job and this happens every single day.
why is nagisa from assasination classroom in this at 1:09
L
omg you found my brother's doppelganger! (he is dead obsessed with DROWNING!) he is always making videos about stickmen drowning
ah the joys of working with kids. In 8th grade i was a TA (teachers assistant) for art for the little kids i think i helped in the k-3rd grade classes but i cant be for sure. But i loved helping them and my favorite the to do was draw with them at the end of class. I drew some supercool ninjas for some boys and just talked to the kids that didnt really have anyone else to talk to. It was so much fun i wish i could be a TA again
*reaches for my nerf gun collection*  I have actual projectiles. How do you wish to bruise?
Why what’s wrong with guns         MAAM THIS IS A CHILD     The part is 6:05
6:05 Why? What’s wrong with guns? …. *Ma’am this is a child…*
The mouth flaps matching to the gun mom instead of your words when you were speaking for her, great animation work
I when to something like this when I was younger
I play airsoft and I'm an army cadet my whole thing is guns I guess I'm going to the time out corner for a long time
Oh my GOSH! A random clip from this animation just popped up in my feed and I just HAD to watch the whole thing. Your animations are adorable and so entertaining and relatable! Instant subscribe from me! Keep up the great work, much love from Texas!
as a Canadian who genuinely has not seen a gun anywhere in real life besides a cops pistol in their belt holster, seeing on YouTube that a 6 year old child is playing guns and his mom thinking that is perfectly normal just astounds me.
So you snitched a kid for playing in his playtime? Lmao. You are also an karen. Also the kid that talked about polution was obviusly full influenced by his parents. So a 6 years old cant play pretend, but a 6 years old can talk about a subject he dosnt know at all
"Oh. So you're ALMOST an adult." Hnnng, that stung XD
I still dont get whats wrong about playing pretend with guns
Karen’s: they’re always wrong. No matter which side of an issue they take, they always manage to be wrong.
Me who played pretend of guns when I was a child, and now I’m a pacifist: cool
I don't share that mothers views but kids should be allowed to express themselves and play how they like as long as it's not bothering other kids. I mean, it IS make-belief after all. Are we really counting on the fact that this boy will not know the difference between fantasy and reality when he gets older? Those are some low expectations
5:55 This is literally not an issue. This is a typical behavior of boys. I used to do this with my friend all the time when I was a kid. We used to have toy guns and go around the neighborhood pretending to be soldiers on a campaign.
That whole "no playing guns" thing makes me angry
I love all the anime references in the background
6:04 ah yes a 🇺🇸 Classic American 🇺🇸
That's all me and my friends did was play guns.
your teacher seems awsome
6:04
I really love your animation style! Feels like a cartoon
I found a loophole to not get in timeout! Real. Guns. Lol
“Don’t play with guns or I will send you to time out”  Me: but-but I want to
This background would have made me so happy as a kid
But playing war, Cowboys and Indians, Cops and Robbers, and spacemarine was fun
Hey children can use gun just under adult supervision
Heh that kid I’m just like him but in preschool and still now guns = fortnite lol
I don’t understand why playing guns is a bad thing. Like we used to do a cops and robbers or solider in a war scenario all the time. Hell I remember a daycare I was at one time and we all made these paper guns that slid back and pretended to shoot each other. I feel like this kid is gonna grow up just thinking him playing is wrong and become antisocial in a way, like ostracize someone for playing pretend??? Like maybe she’s being gentle with her descriptions and the kid was just been hyper aggressive but from the way it sounds it seems like he was running around going pew pew and just doing his own thing. Like let the kid play man. He’s not hurting anyone and I feel it’s just putting a kid down for political reasons.    Mom still sounded like a Karen.
Harry Potter doll
Guns?!?! Really?!?! Common kid it’s more fun to play killer ants then guns! Guns are boring :b. At least that’s what I did as a kid.
All I remember from my childhood was playing soldier/cowboys/cops. We spent hours on end chasing each other with sticks making gunshot sounds and demanding our friends had been hit by our imaginary bullets. Of course, we also were in the south where we each had gotten our first gun and lessons on safety at age 7 or 8 and been taken hunting at 10 or 11. Guns weren't something terrible or mysterious for us and we only ever played those games with imaginary guns and then later on paintball or airsoft. We knew what actual guns were capable of and not to play with them. If Bo likes playing pretend with guns that's normal behavior from my point of view. If he's a violent child who hurts his friends or animals then there's a real issue.
Yo that gun thing is normal
Luigi gettin jiggy with it in the background
Only in America will you have people using their amendment rights as their excuse to do bad things
If we already know why are you telling us again? If it is for those that don't know why include "You already know"?
Hah who needs pretend guns when you got real ones such as a maverick rev-6
Video games cause violence. That what Imma tell my kid to piss people off.
I'm going to play pretend guns. HAHAHHAHAHAHHA
Why dose this school look like a house?
Holy shit. Every part of this is exactly why folks need to get their kids out of the public school system.
The fact that all this drama over a harmless kid's play exists pisses me off! I know it's about killing and guns, but it's *pretend,* not real. If he was playing while hurting others, ok, but the fact he got time out without even hurting any of the other kids is just over the top and unnecessary.
7:24 That's a good rule. I guess I'll just have to play real guns instead.
Oh no, i actually play pretend with lotta guns and actually build these nice cardboard replicas since i was like 5 or something, please someone help me i dont want to be sent to timeout, not again
Oh no, i actually play pretend with lotta guns and actually build these nice cardboard replicas since i was like 5 or something, please someone help me i dont want to be sent to timeout, not again
*Ma'am this is a child.*
Omfg this generation is so weak. I'm only 30 and I played with toy guns AAAAAAAAALL the time as a kid. Yes even on the playground with sticks rifles and rock grenades. Boys love to play in make believe violent conflicts. This is not bad behavior, its normal. I can't wait to teach my 7 year old how to properly and safely handle a firearm.  Why are young millennial so hell bent on pussifying and making every little boy so docile and incapable of standing up for themselves? I gave illymations another chance and this was very disappointing.
Oh, boy! Time to play pretend guns! My favorite!
So this is old but I wanted to share my own experience. I want to be a preschool teacher so a few years ago I got a week long internship a few years ago. Of course I didn’t get to know the kids that well individually but it was really fun. When I had to go home the last day they were so sweet. I hugged them all and got a gift basket and everything and it was clear they wanted me to stay. Normally they didn’t even do internships with people at my age but older ones who had already started to the education so it was really special. Probably also helped it was very small with like 27 kids total so not the standard kind of preschool. Also the Danish version is not the same system but I googled it and that is what daycare for 3-5 year olds before they start school is called so I’m using that term
I know that all of these kids are just like : “THATS ME!”
Kids learning gun safety from an early age is good Having them pretend to use them as more than self defense isnt
Me and my mom used to run an at home daycare, and i can confirm that dealing with the parents is the a absolute worst part of the job.  The kids were always great, but dear god the parents were sometimes a nightmare .
The other kids: plays school   Bo:😏
I don’t think playing guns as a six year old is that inappropriate honestly. I think HOW he was playing guns is inappropriate. Killing his friends and the stuff they enjoyed doing.   The reason I don’t think it’s inappropriate is because of action movies, action cartoons and superhero stuff and video games. Even in lego Star Wars and stuff some of the characters have guns. Water guns are universally fun (just don’t point them a unwanting people or more importantly authority figures) How else is the super cool secret agent going to defeat the evil guys. Right? But this kid wasn’t playing like that he was playing like. “I am the evil guy and I’ll shoot everything!” Which is a bad sign and probaly would’ve continued distanced him from other students socially.
Is young kids playing guns really that inappropriate? I played war with my friends as a kid all the time.
"pew pew your bleeding! oh now your dead. ahah bozo i knew you were no match for me!" said the 6 year old. atleast thats what i imagine timeouttime lol
Oh no fake guns? …. Real guns it is then!
*Plastic exist* Future Devin: I'm about to end this man's whole career.
I do t play pretend guns, I play REAL GUNS 😎

Subscribed because this was so cute😍
Amazing vid I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
While I agree that how much Bo played pretend guns was excessive, it doesn't seem that bad to me. I played pretend guns a lot as a kid too and here I am: a 24 year old from so cal who does not own any guns.
Illy: "Don't play pretend guns or I *will* send you to time out!" Me, a frequent Call of Duty player: "When ?"
ya know, i gotta agree with this karen chick, guns arent bad. but you are right in how she treated her son around them. thats very f*cked up. yeah this chick needs to understand how to educate her son better, but she is right in how guns arent bad.
I remember when kids in my kindergarten class would pretend to shank each other with block knives, in addition to Block Gun fights.
ilymation: Don’t play pretend guns Me: playing a video game that requires guns to win, or benefit you in game*
......*picks up a block* pew pew your dead now i shot you
I love the anime stuff in the background of your videos
The 😁 in the background reference to animate
You remind me so much of my old c.a.r.e.s teacher, when I first saw this back in 2020 I just sat there freaked out because of how similar you guys were.
This reminds me of when I was in pre school and I LOVED pretend but there were always other girls in the pretend corner did that bother me? No I was a social tiny person but they ALWAYS made me be the dad. I was sooo pissed but the teachers wouldn’t do anything about it.
PEW PEW
1:09 I think I recognize the person taking the photo
What if he perdition Fortnite
3:08 anybody else see hawks   Edit: and a few other seens
Fake but ok
Kind of on the Karen's side ngl. :/  Maybe it's just my area, but the age of six is kind of around the time boys would start pretend fighting with guns included. Cops and robbers that sort of thing. "Bang bang bang you're dead!" That sort of thing.
Man, when I was a kid, all the games I played involved some kind of pretend violence. Now, I had more diversity in pretend weapons than Bo did, I'd be running around calling a stick a sword and saying I was a knight or I'd find a rock and say it was a grenade and pretend to be a soldier. All the kids I knew did that too. The only problems that would arise from it were one kid would say "nuh, uh I'm wearing a bullet proof vest" and then the whole game would stop while we argued over whether or not he's dead.  All things considered, it sounds like you went too hard on Bo. Let him have his fun.
MissaLissa
🔫 well guys I guess I’m going to time out
"DON'T PLAY PRETEND GUNS OR I WILL SEND YOU TO TIMEOUT"   pew pew 🔫
some day these kids will see this video
My brother had a cat named luigi. Do you call him weege?
I played guns when i was in kider garded
Pretending to play with gus in not allowed for kids? Really? It's like, the most kid thing to do. Even I used to play robbers with my friends and bro all the time as a kid.  I guess it's because it's America and grown ups are allowed to own guns there.
Anime watchers watching this video 👈😯
I didn't think I would ever say such a sentence, but Karen was right.
Me Owns least truck of rifles : Gun is Bad Kids !
surprisingly that sort of violent pretend play is very common for kids at a really young age. I was raised up in ohio and most of the ways we entertained ourselves was wrestling, sword fighting with sticks, and mothafucking lazer tag that we set up on a hill and basically treated like war. but yea should definitely not be doing it in a class environment.
Dalainie: *lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed*
I was on the fence about the gun debate stuff until the part where the mother turned on a dime. If she is that dishonest, she immediately loses my support. I will say though that the description of the pretend that “Bo” was involved in is a bit vague, so I’m not sure I agree with banning it altogether, but it definitely should be considered for discussion. Too bad it sounds like that mother isn’t interested in discussing it in a constructive manner though.
In germany, being 19 means you are already an adult, aka a lot of responsibilities. I would like to go back a few years, re-think some of my choices, and maybe, idk, learn some more i guess (i'm broke)
Who pays for a cat?
When illy (ik that isn't her real name) says...Kid(s) counter! 45678
My favorite experience with a kid was when the special Ed class I helped out in had a field trip to Disneyland and a few other students who helped out in that class went to. One of the students in the Ed class I was close with and we went on haunted mansion together, meaning we sat in the same cart. He got scared some way through and I told him if he got scared to grab my hand and squeeze it. He did. During the entire experience I made small jokes here and there to try and cheer him up and even yelled at the projection of the ghost woman that “I can do that too” and copied what she said in the same voice she had. It always made me happy when he smiled and laughed and even when he was sad, because I always found some way to cheer him up, asking him to color, or to blow some bubbles, or even playing tag which is a game I absolutely hate by the way because I hate running and being touched in any way even by a lot of family members- so it was rare for me to offer that- but I did so to cheer him up. I loved that boy- he was so fucking cute- not in a weird crushy way- no he was innocent, naive and adorable- that kind of way-
I don't think Bo's pretend play was wrong, but I do agree with you on how confusing it would be to have a mother flip flop on an issue depending on who she's talking to.   All she's teaching to her son is that he needs to be manipulative to get what he wants.  Edit: Changed the name from Devin to Bo. Wrote the comment at the end of the video, so that's my bad. Lol.
So did you tell him that if you burn plastic, it reduces to carbon that can be mixed into soil.
Who was the female chipmunk who was a mecanic?
Comment for the algorithms!
Damn that’s sad I was told (in detail) by my sister about the birds and the bees at the age of 6 :*)
There is literally nothing wrong with guns, no one should give a single crap about it. While I admit that lady’s behavior was over the top, she had a point.
Me a police officer: hmm yess, I play with real gun
i dont play with pretend guns, i play with real guns.
“Don’t play with pretend guns or I will send you to time out” HA M16 GO BRRRRR
I may be pro gun, but I’m aware there’s a line to be drawn.  * death stares at Karen*
DO NOT PLAY PRETEND GUNS OR I WILL PUT YOU IN TIME OUT
There is nothing wrong with the boy playing with a block like its a gun, the kid probably just enjoys action adventure media or hunts at home with his family. I grew up in a family that both hunted and handled guns quite often, if taught proper safety at a young age (for me it was around this boy's age if not a year younger) pretend gun games are completely harmless. Hell me and my little brother would actively carve spears and bows using out bush craft sets (machetes, hatchets, and other assorted tools) then run around the woods shooting or spearing trees acting like they were either extinct animals or any other various fun things we wanted to hunt. We had everything from pellet rifles to BB guns (there is a difference but i won't get into that here) and we used to play with them just the same, though we were taught never to point them at anyone and even a toy gun can bring out bad situations (someone mistaking it for a real gun and you getting hurt or something akin to that) the boy should have just been reprimanded for pointing at people who were not engaged in the game with him, but those who were playing with him and knew it was just a game would have faced no more danger from a toy block than a tag in hide and seek. Its just kids being kids and having interests, one shouldn't punish or shame someone for having interests like this, i remember being in the kid's shoes when i drew hunters or warriors with their guns and kills (successful hunts, battle images, ect i loved creating stories that were more than just simple fables as i watched a lot of monster horror and action films growing up), teachers have called me psycho, weird, and every other word under the sun because i grew up with a family that hunted for their food and understood both the dangers and usefulness guns had and enjoyed using these tools in my art or games I'd play. While i sympathize with you dealing with a Karen I don't entirely agree with you punishing the boy for just having a healthy interest in something that's very real, he needed guidance not stifling or punishment.
Send me to time out then
😠 what's wrong with guns? 😳 MA'AM THIS IS A CHILD
That was pretty cute ngl, but I actually don't understand the fear of a boy at his age pretending to be a gunman. I do understand that these days school shootings are a norm so I get why we would want to teach them that guns can take a life easily if in the wrong hands. However, at his age it's completely normal to have a fixation towards it as in the end a lot of kids can be exposed to this stuff not just by parents but by other people. I genuinely don't think him playing pretend badguy or gunman should have bern punished as it may have actually be harmful for him at that age. Though who knows I'm sure he's fine, people respond to unnecessary punishment in different ways. I do like your stuff tho, you made cute content 💕
I love how the worst part WAS the adults. That should say something...
just appreciating the lip syncing on 6:11
Luigi - The best character in the whole series
Wait. What happened to karen? Was she and her kid banned? I need to know.
Illy i like your vids aspecially bc ANIME i recognized koro sensei naruto hawks and others and if you dont put anime characters in your vids i still enjoy them
"oh you let your kids play with guns  what a bad mum"
When i was a kid, Me and my friend always had this game we called “Dogs vs Cats” (for some reason we really hated cats) but I would always pretend to be a mouse and he’d play a dog trying to protect & save me, my mouse character, who I’m pretty sure I gave the genius name of “Mousey” always ended up in an oven doing some Die Hard style escapist moves. I was a weird kid… now I’m just a weird teen!
Som nom
Illy: and their character designs will not represent what they look like in real life Me: does that mean she BLACKWASHED DELANEY!?!?!?!

Haha. Beau. Like Bow Which is also a ranged weapon. Like Gun.
3:53 oh that's fine come oooooooon, baby just watched star wars and played stormtroopers, i'm sure his karen mom has her arms secured and doesn't expose them to him at any cost...yeah...like...80% sure. 75%.

I was watching this for the 5th time and I only just noticed Koro Sensai took the photos at Disney land. I got the rest of the anime references though.
We had to count to 120 in Spanish and boy was 60-80 difficult
Tell me why I grew up doing the “violent” play thing thinking it was normal. When I played barbies with cousins I could always be the murderer or the robber.
Illy:umm guns are illegal and he is trying to murder 6 yr Karen:so?murdering is so fun
Pew pew I’ve got a nerf gun
Devon is definitely gonna bring about climate improvement
Honestly,I wonder if Karen watched this video and saw that would be amazing
My 6 yo brother likes to pretend he is fighting and he will come and kick us and punch us it doesn't hurt that much because hes six but we figured it was normal because he's he's boy then he started chasing us around with plastic uh "grey sticks with sharp ends and handles"  and now we are slightly concerned he is very violent and once said TO HIS TEACHER I am going to kill you because he didn't get a prize from the box
OMG I JUST NOTICED ALL MIGHT

love your videos so creative honest and hilarious=)
Omg hi I love ur videos
Dallane  kind of sound's like some one from fuck telsus
This story is wild! Though on both parties the guns aspect shouldn't be where the problem lies, it is the practice of "outlaw-ish" behavior which should have been the focus, but given the environment and ages of all involved I can see how that was neglected.  "Outlaw-ish" Behavior: Practices of pretend stealing, murdering, assault or extortion.  Though with guns being a very formal part of American society, I do believe gun education should be a required class in schools, but I honestly have no idea at which age this should be considered. Maybe as part of science curriculum when discussing explosive elements? No idea for certain, I guess this would need to be weighted based on Urban/Rural needs. Obviously children in rural areas are more likely to be exposed to guns and should be given an earlier priority then children in Urban areas, but I digress. Honestly I wish when I was young I had gotten a formal education on them instead of "Guns bad and why you should hate them!". I hated them for how loud they were! Nowadays though I love them and the communities around them are usually very wholesome people.....until they start talking about calibers, then my goodness it is time to just turn around and leave.

I like the  alien teacher one you know the one that is yellow with a little black hat
As a kid with afterschool on Wednesday and thursday is fun because i bring sonic playing cards in a minecraft playing cards tin and i call the game "Bring out your beast!"
Ehem at the start GON in the left corner caught my eye real fast
We have a kid who likes to play that the animals were hurt/dead and bloody so we have to fix them. Then another kid likes to play that a big monster eats everyone, destroy the town, arrest people, etc. It’s kinda funny/odd what some want to play
I wish my bro was like davin

Illy: boe likes to pretend blocks are guns and pretend he is killing his friends)Karen:what is wrong it is just pretend?!
I wish I could go to that school! It sounds so fun!
No bc me and my neighbour, lets call him door, sonce thats his name in a game, we were at church abd played gun fight with chicken nuggets, aka holding them like guns and going "pew pew" and pretending to dodge. His brother, lsts call him wall, since thats his name in the game just watched. We then ate our pretend guns.
0:03 why do I hear “to suffer”
*I'm playing with guns*
My cousin went to your daycare. After comparing her and Delaney, I figured out it was meant to be her. She watched the video with me and said she misses you.
Was that a Hunter X Hunter Reference
“My summer as a after school teacher”  Me: you have school in summer?!?!?!
*Plays with pretend guns*Illyssa looks at me. "TIME FOR TIMEOUUUT...... >:) OH no I'm in timeout gosh darn it-
Imagine if one of these kids commented on this video and remembered you illy.
My brother always pretends to shoot people and he always got in trouble.
I just noticed in the background is Gon and canary from HxH! Also, I noticed the other Anime references!
Pew pew
I hope the kids that u watched at the place watch this vid and Learn sooooo many thing! Ur great illymations!!!
Wait! 1st grade learns pollution? Please don’t judge, but, I’m in 3rd grade, and I use to be learning pollution in this grade!
My brother is beau and he is 6 but he doesn’t like guns, he likes zombies and stuff but he’s rlly sweet
I honestly was bo for the most part 😂 at least my mom saw an issue with it (after a while) bc I had a very extensive knowledge of weapons for like a 2 or 3, maybe 4th grader?
Korosensei on the calendar, well played Illysa
why dose Boe sound exactly like my brother Barrett and look exactly like my brother Barrett who is in 1st grade and is 6 years old and that's how my step mother would act...
WHAT'S WRONG WITH GUNS??????  WHAT KIND OF MOTHER IS THIS?????
I was just I was just made a pure water I was just crying in the corner

Google flashbacks man I would literally have to when for my brothers because they will be joining shooting old enough concepts fun dog to it. Is a bowl with so that's impossible
I really want to get experience working with kids. And this just made me decide that yes I definitely want to try it. But I have been told I suck at explaining stuff so I’d be a pretty bad teacher…😂🤣😂
Mammy can I have the gun
Delaney: the literal sun Devon: concern cinnamon roll Bo: Kraken- I mean Karen’s horrid son
My name is delaney
Hidden leaf attack on Titan : 1:15

"R2d247" I am dying of laughter 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
1:59. The S M I L E.
Illy I’ll delete COD off my Xbox just please put down the detention slip

0:30 1:22
I don't wanna play guns. But I'll go to time.out. to look after the other kids.
Illy: how do you know about guns?? Bo: Let me teach about a game called "Call of Duty Black ops II." Enough said.
1:44
I play with a lot of guns @illymation
You Don't Own Me
“Illy talking about something serious “  Luigi dancing
Hey Miss Alyssa it’s me “Delaney quote I didn’t know you made animations until now🤩
illy: don’t play guns or I will send you to time out.  Me a bisexual: *looks at finger guns* …. Oh no
*Pew Pew*
GUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i just realised i have a dog named mario and i named it when i was little as fuck holy this relatability is too high
I think that kids act like some things because of trama or something.
Soo much anime things- I love it
Fun Fact: Kids care about the earth more then adults.
The fact I can actually lip-read this animation shows how well done it is.
koro sensi hawks all might
I love the small Amir references in every single illy vid
Yeah... my six year old brother also loves guns... We didn't encourage this, or even expose him to it willingly. I don't know what happened. We also live in Canada in a gun-free house.
I wake up at 6:08 for Elementary school
Bo's play "pretend" is hilarious
I love these videos so much!
gonna name references, Naruto, Koro-sensei, hawks, Pikachu, Rowlett, Kirishima, mew, and all might. this isn't all of them but they were the ones I noticed Edit: forgot Demon Slayer and Attack On Titan
4:20 ik this is an old vid but just the Dabi(Toya/touya) in the background with hawks is just magnificent 👁👄👁✨
not me who just finished assassination classroom and then watched this video. (the world is in good hands)
POV:you looked in the background and saw your favorite anime’s
When I was younger in kindergarten my friend told me let’s play with these legos and make a gun out of them I knew that wasn’t ok but I was 4-5i didn’t know any better and after like 5 minutes our teacher cought us and we got in trouble side note when we got caught and our teacher  pointed at the no guns sines
The issue isn't even that hes pretending to play with guns, the problem is that he was pretending to use those guns to be the bad guy and shoot innocent people or just be the doom bringer in general
Omg I had a kid just like Bo. So I was getting paid to watch a group of kids ages 3-10 for a couple of hours on Tuesday nights while there parents were meeting with each other. And this Kid I’ll call himmm Micah. Micah loved pretending everything was a weapon. EVERYTHING. His goldfish were missals, his brothers diapers were bombs, his animals were constantly dying, and he was describing every bloody gun shot bullet gore moment. He was 7. When he went as far as killing his 3 year old brother, I shut it down for good and told his mom.
Ma'am, I am a fully grown man child why can't i play guns?
no
4:20 THE LITTLE DRAWINGS ON THE WALL ARE SO CUTE DYJTRDRSRXTRT
Next year I’m going to volunteer at an after school place and I kind of already help out there now and there some… interesting kids there. So I really hope something like that doesn’t happen to me💀
º º º 🔫  pew Pew
I also have a cat named luigi lol
The little boy 👦🏻 is right
Groovy.
Fat cat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Karen’s name is prob Victoria lmao
Kid: uses blocks for guns mom: what’s wrong with guns? illy: …… 😐
...* pew pew *
Assassination classroom
As an after school instructor as my job I totally relate, especially with the kids talking about inappropriate things… like 1st graders talking about squid games at its peak of popularity… same with anime like demon slayer being their favorite…. Parents… PLEASE look at what your kids watch and play! And if they did watch it talk with them and make sure they understand why it was inappropriate.
that kid that hated plastic probably donatied 10000+ money to teamseas  (sorry im late)
even tho i dont know who you are have a wonderful and blessed day
*finger gun points at you*
Global warming is a myth or at the very least EXTREMELY WAY OVER EXAGGERATED to a point where people think it's so bad it will end the world if we don't do something about it, which it is not. It is melting on some parts of it but it's also freezing over on the other parts, it's at a balance that it's no big deal. Wake up people.
NAGISA 1:09
As a southerner I can confirm we are extremely interested in guns, when I was a kid I asked for an antique revolver for Christmas. What did I get? Just that. I was always responsible with it and kept it on a HIGH SHELF to make sure that I'd never touch it. It's still on that shelf.    Also my mother is a Karen except she's extremely positive, overprotective and does the right things with her authority and overtime got me HYPED THROUGHOUT CHILDHOOD TO GET A VACCINE ANYTIME I NEEDED ONE AS A KID. She is literally the best Karen out of all.
WHY IS THE CAT ALWAYS DANCING T-T
Wow a video on Christmas eve
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA SAY DO U KNOw THE MUFFIN MAN😭🤣
At first when that lil red head kid said “do u know what the most evil thing in the world is?”
Did anyone else see  Koro sensei in the background
Illy:😶 Karen 🤬 🔫
Bow: GiVe Me ThE MoNeY oR ThE DoG GeTs It Illymation: what the f-
That last story reminds me of when I worked in daycare. We had this kid, we'll call him Kevin, and Kevin one day decided that he didn't want to share any of the toys. Kevin would walk up to another kid, take whatever toy they were playing with, play with it for like a minute, then abandon it to go steal a toy from another kid. I put him into timeout for not sharing, and after he got out, everything was fine. Or, so we thought. Kevin's mom comes in to pick him up at the end of the day, and she found out her precious angel was put into timeout. She then goes on a rampage, yelling at all the teachers because how dare we discipline her child, and only she is allowed to do so. From then on, Kevin wasn't allowed to be put into time out, for fear of his mother's wrath.
Pew pew you are now dead
even the karen is having the classic karen haircut i mean even her face is lookin like a karen xD
Are they the only ones that can say illyssa right .o.
Pew pew
Pew pew
Uh oh Im playing pretend guns somone stop me
I can’t be the only one who saw The assassination classroom calendar in the back 🔥🤪
Bro Karen really said “Come and take it!” Like this was the very southwestest of southwest of Texas😂
*shoots gun fingers*
You have to be 18 to be an adult
I love when a cat dances
koro-senseeeeeeeeeiiiiiii😭 may he rest in peace
Okay as someone who is against full on gun control that Karen is CRAZY
Pew pew🔫🔫
Describing Delaney as Fun Dip reminds me of Space Boy.  It’s a really great webcomic with gorgeously written characters and a beautiful balance between great art and great writing.
Totally not me remembering that time I sold “drugs” in 2nd grade-   (The drugs were little plastic dice or gems or something-)
I love ow Luigi is just dancing in the background

And as always stay safe byeeeee.
i like that u put koro sensi on the date bord
As a childcare educator, the kids are never the problem, it’s always the parents/guardians. I’ve met some unbelievable parents and the hardest part of the job is trying to respect the guardian’s rights while also just trying to help raise a good kid.
in every video she has a Koro Sensei plush in the background.does anybody even know what that is?
Ummm so when I’m older I wanna be a full time teacher and I wanna ask. Is it worth it?
Ms. Sherif seems so cool though
Oh lord- I accidentally clicked the dislike button.
Never said real guns
'don't play pretend guns or I will send you to time out!' Jaiden Animations's finger gun idea:
I guess I go to time out wait I have nerf guns ha
1:21 man has some moves
"DONT PLAY GUNS OR ILL SEND YOU TO TI E OUT!!" **immediately changes subject** "and as always" XD

I USED TO BE A CHILD!!!!
No yeah no yeah that has to be my favorite part
Not Luigi dancing 💃 in the bg cry 😭
does it count if i play gun games? lol!
7:24 Jokes on you, I got real guns to play with 🔫🤠
Fun fact:in my house hold,playing with pretend guns are kinda normal(I personally don't like it tho)So my parents would buy my little brother blocks so he could make the 345 sup or something.Or they would buy him toy guns.Yeah...
I used to be a teacher aid for a second grade classroom. It was great. One time  when the teacher left to use the bathroom  I taught a couple kids a favorite prank of mine. Get a peice of clear tape and staple it, then get a red marker and color the tape around the staple. Wrap it around your finger and it looks like you stapled your finger and are using a peice of tape as a temp band aid.  When the teacher came back they were all like "!!!! Miss teacher!!!! I stapled my finger!!!!" And it was great until I got ratted out by the kids for teaching them that. Good times, I might go back again
So ur almost an adult   What gurl she is basically 20
I love that you drew a Noctowl in the background. Not a more iconic pokemon like Charmander or something no no, Noctowl. And I freaking love it
Lily: I hope Delaney wouldn’t change Reality : yeah, nah, definitely not, cause I’m about to ruin this kid’s head

I am want some topic make my animation video
Karen really looks like a karen
You remind me of my baby sitter from a long time ago
YOULL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE *angry imaginary pew pew gun noises intensifies*
Im 4 I pla read dedredempton
I mean, agree with Illy’s reaction. But stick guns and such are perfectly fine. I mean kids are playing online games screaming at each other with gore and all. It really is only pretend, and studies have shown that kids once they encounter a real gun after having played with toy ones, are more apprehensive. Kids are smarter than they seem. In all it’s just pretend, I remember being yelled at for playing Star Wars stick guns with friends, and riding a traffic cone as a “speeder bike”. Or throwing snowballs at each other and being told there may be ice. It’s weird. The school system will end up teaching a softer generation.
*Proceeds to do finger guns as I leave for my next video*
I DONT WANNA GO TO TIME OUT
19=almost an adult
Oh kiddo you dont know that in 10 billion year the sun would explode and all life would Vanished
Trust me when I was a little kid around that age I was far worse
Anyone notice how Luigi is doing the Toontown Victory Dance?
a hunter watching the end of the vide be like dont worry ill play real guns
ok i'll play with real guns
I am so sleepy. I need that dancing luigi energy...
*chokes in supprise* Is that………. My name?????? I am happy bc you don’t see my name literally everywhere- And no ❤️ you don’t get to know my name, so you have to guess >:)
Can you make a Chanel for day care stories like this one cause this was like my favorite breakfast lunch dinner and desert in a video
“Here are the anime references you ordered. Where do you want ‘em?”  Illy: Y E S
it’s a block shaped as a gun i do not care about somebody playing guns at my school bc all u gotta so is make friends with em and ur not under any stress about being shot during a school shoot out
The odds of @illymarion seeing this..  turn I’m trying to work on my digital art and was wondering any chance you’d be interested in letting me try to do a  simple art for you I’m not that good but I love your videos
ahem i see assentation classroom reference ty
Sounds like a great boss
I refuse to accept that the signs say “here for the chaos” I know that they do, but I wanna believe they say “I’m here for the chads”
OMG
Get tu cats en naimet
I'm like 90% sure that the Bo kid had unrestricted access to the internet and somehow came across something like Madness Combat, and loved the shit out of it.
the devin kid seems fun
That revealing of a person's true nature to fellow coworkers was something lived for when I was working in childcare. I cared for the kids more than anything else, so parents not giving a damn how they damaged their children made me so mad
I worked with kids back when I attempted university. It was the best time of my life
I feel like i would like your supervisor xD
Reminds me of when I was 4-6 and my dad would give me a gun every other day and teach me how to shoot it ,  a real gun ,  actually loaded ,  until my mom found out after work and got mad   Tbh why would you give a 4 ,  5 or 6 year old a gun though
Bou playing Fortnite
I have a classmate That’s name is bo
0.05 WAS THAT CANARY-
Man i remember using the huge  toy shovel as an ak and the teacher used to stop me lol   My mom wasn't happy

P.E.W P.E.W 👈🏻😈✌️
I play BB guns
Bow is like my brother
4:34 that dude from assination classroom on the wall
7:24 no not the time out
Which age do those kids think is the beginning of adulthood? They could be just hearing the word “teen” and assuming all teenagers are minors, but part of me is wondering if they actually have a specific age they consider “grown up”. I’ve never seen a kid underestimate someone’s age or maturity before. Usually if ur a lot bigger than them then you are indistinguishable from other adults (unless they have a teenage older sibling).
I can’t ever find and animator that doesn’t cuss ;-;
Ms Allisa dont send me to time out!!!!1
I love dancing Luigi 😂
I hope she never loses happiness Me who lost my happiness at 7: ok
“So you’re almost an adult”    That made me laugh so hard 😂😂😂🤣🤣
1:44 "HimynameisDelaneyIhave2LooseTeethmyfavoritecolorisyellowcauseitsbrightandhappyIwannaflylikethesun"
What is the most evil thing in the world.  Democracy
imagine being someone in this video, watching it, and listening to all the nice things your teacher has to say about you.
"What's wrong with guns?", she asks. Do you want the chronological list or alphabetical?
The girl in yellow I don’t remember her name but she’s basically me but girl because I am basically a hyper energy ball and 100% made of sugar I don’t even think I have water in my blood it’s just sugar can’t even sleep at night
Can I play pretend slingshots then?
Someone answer me He hasn’t posted a video on a long time I’m worried

I don’t know if your second amendment right because it’s not my right to and I believe you have that right to have guns but allowing him to get away with that is not gonna end good. I hope it doesn’t happen
My…my name is Delaney 😧 my…my favorite color is yellow….Im chaotic. I’ve NEVER heard my name in a YouTube video before, it’s VERRYY weird

If my brother and I went to this daycare, he would live in timeout

It’s not a mistake ✨ITS A MASTERPIECE✨
I’ve always thought it was really  cool that I could tell what anime you had been watching by paying attention to your animations!, your a great artist
Holy shit about that watergun kid that’s terrifying…
I like how the kids are using her first name instead of last name
I played cod at 5 or 6🤣🤣🤣
“Ma'am, it's a gun.”, had the exact same energy as “Sir, this is a Wendy's.”  Okay now. There is a giant debate going on in the comments. THIS COMMENT IS A JOKE. It is meant yo be FUNNY.
I swear your videos make me so happy😭🖤
My name is Delaney!!
Did yo guys notice how Devon’s ears look like fives if you look inside them
Look, I've worked in childcare an this is all very correct. I do have to say that even in the South, we need to discourage kids from playing guns not because of any anti-gun mentality, but merely because kids don't understand context and need to learn that anything qualifying as "school," including childcare facilities, are a no-gun zone. This is because if a kid play guns in a school environment in the United States, there is an actual danger of that child being expelled. Hence why, in some states, this is a mandated policy.  I don't care if you have a gun at home. We just gotta teach them young so you're child isn't screwed out of an education because they picked up a stick on the playground and went "Bang!"
Omg illy! I saw that Star of David behind yo computer!!!! I love hat there are Jewish Animators here on YouTube!
Did not collect the cheez-it’s  Me, a former aftercare kid: *le gasp*
Thank you for sharing this
The mom wasn’t wrong her kid should be aloud to play guns because she knows he’s a kid and most of the time kids aren’t really serious about what the make believe I mean when you said that “we don’t allow that kind of play here” that blew my mind what do you mean. their is no boundary’s to imagination.
If Karen acts like that she should NEVER get a gun
For 8 - everybody else  it’s okay to play guns but children 6 and under is not good
🔫🔫 pew pew
1:16 did u notice the naruto demon slayer attack on titan and zelda refrence on the computer
My little brother is boe    *he's 5*
Pretending you have a gun isn't necessarily bad. Pretending to threaten, rob, or murder people however is a problem and that kid probably needs therapy! people like that mother who was chewing you out are what's wrong with the world these days.
Can we appreciate the fact the cats name is Luigi
Koro Sensei
I don't  want  time out^^
Her Kerin drawing I’d sooooo good
When I was that age like 15 years ago we all played guns and "shot" eachother and continously screamed out "YOURE DEAD" I know there's more buzz about it because of actual school shooters but man there's nothing wrong with little boys playing guns
I was so happy when I saw Hunter X Hunter are there in soul eater Because HUNTERxHUNTER is my favorite anime and I also like soul eater a lot
My 5 year old cousin walks around with like 8 guns / plastic guns comes to pretending to rob us  says : i will summon the minecraft wither storm on you and got to the internet before toy cars and he became messed up  and his 3 year old sister follows him like the horse and its tail  i just i’am trying to keep him on offline games cuz reaching to YouTube is it APPROPRIATE for a 5 year old as he CURSED as his sister he watches inappropriate mc animators i’am trying to make him a kid even tho its hard to be one in covid , a KID SHOULD NOT BE ON YouTube what happened to YouTube kids man..
Lungi  dancing  in the background:

That’s very relatable don’t you think but I do love the story
The police can't do anything to me, but as soon as Ms. Sheriff enters the room I go right back into the crib cuz I ain't gonna do shit that angers her

Man, western civilization is getting weirder and weirder. Not allowing kids to play guns is wrong. It may give the opposite results. Somehow this is the only part of the world to have school shootings for breakfast
I just realized this was uploaded on Christmas Eve.

Interesting that kid thought 19 is almost an adult. Back in the 90s, kids use to think 19 years old was "old". Times have changed.
Just in the 26 sec i think i counted 7 anime refs😭
Good luck with that I am 12
Pew pew look at my new MKseven 😈🔫
Karen: what’s wrong with guns? Me: …… women….. THIS IS A 6 YEAR OLD!!
Little Beau shouldn’t look up to Karen’s at this point

Bow’s answer to violence is yes
Bo is like me in 1st grade 🤣
5:49  she was the definition of “America”  *karen was*

Illy’s Mind: How Much Anime References Do You Want? Illy: Anime.
7:25 im your mom now
Your supervisor is chill as ice
I thought the kid was gonna say “do you know... THE MUFFIN MAN”
Sorry I'm a bit late to the party, but it's funny how the child in the opening said you weren't an adult at 19 which social work theorists like Erikson and Piaget would say is true as they theorized that adulthood starts at 21 years of age. So, there's an interesting tip for anyone! Also, I wouldn't mind being called "not an adult" as I would be like "yeah, I'm so rad and young, not feeling old at all! HE🏒🏒 yeah!"
yoooooo i have a cat named Luigi ❤️
1:48  The suns literally killing us in 5 billion earth years.

Oh jeez, well she would have had a field day with me. I played a lot of really violent pretend in my youth.
3:55 hey, its a little version of me!...  i can explain
Bang :3
I bet blond woman is called karen (just clicked on this, )
I wish you made a movie or movies , love your work
As a kid I played Cowboys and Indians with my brother so I mean there’s nothing wrong with playing just make sure the parents are aware so they can teach their kids appropriate gun safety. My kid is 12 and I let her hold my completely empty gun just so she can feel the weight and so I can teach her how to check the gun to make sure its unloaded.  She doesn’t like loud noises so I don’t teach her how to shoot yet she’s not mature enough for that yet. I always make sure that my weapons/Ammo are locked up when not on my hip or at my job I live in a open carry state and work armed security. Though you could have not called it time out and called it jail time cause if he’s gonna do the pretend crime he can do the pretend time xD
I like missus sheriff

Cool
I’ve also worked with kids and they’re crazy. One time a kid went poop and started throwing his poop around. He said he did it because he didn’t want it anymore…
Hey that’s deli!

did anyone else see the mha characters?
The person that you named Karen is a real Karen🧐🤨🧐🤨
I don't think there's anything wrong with kids playing with PRETEND guns. Like his mother said, it's playing pretend, big deal - that's where you can get your wilder fantasies out of your system. I know I played a lot of violent games in elementary school, and no one got hurt for real.  Her flip-flopping attitude though, there's no reason for that, she should pick where she stands and stick to it.
my mom let me use actual guns ( mine was a sniper more like a rifle ) when I was 12 with bullets
omg i love all the koro-sensei refferences XD
My school: No guns  Also my school with cnn 10: Oh yeah some russian people with guns and tanks are invading some where oh yeah “t h i s  i s  t o t t a l l y  a l l o w e d”
Crap i cant play valorant anymore, ill be sent to timeout.

Pardon me, Illymation, I have news for you; You are a sinner, and you are doomed, yet there's also a good side of this; There's someone who can help you and his name is Jesus, he can help you, just come to him and believe that he died on the cross for you and then live a holy life for him, Amen.

nope
true true
I support guns, but no 6 yeat old should be playing guns, at least not where they're killing their friends/other kids....
So, i go to golf class, and there's this kid, he looks like 5, and he is always playing guns with the golf club (the teachers don't do anything) as soon i saw that kid i instantly thought about this video

Honestly devin is mr beast jr i swear
I would say ma’am do you want your child to become a suicide person when they’re a grown woman or man or man do you want your child to kill other people and kill and then eventually have no other people to kill but you and him that what I would say because I might be seven I know how to be your mother I don’t know how to be a mother that’s no way of being a mother because my mama because my mama are used to be a cop a cop I tell you
Who’s use any cards why don’t you just in the video because in the cards with waste peoples time you know I’m not trying to be rude but I don’t really like in cards so I’m really sorry about that I’m not trying to hurt your feelings or anything but still no not really cooperating with people and why are you do in cards
.

WHERE IS ABNORMAL CHAOS PLUSH
pew pew
I like pretend play with real machinegun.
Pew pew
Beau:MUM! WHY DID YOU DO THAT 7 YEARS AGO???
I like kids, but I don't want any of my own. I used to have these neighbors and their kids fucking LOVED me! Mostly because I consistently validated their opinions instead of just brushing them off 'cause they're kids! Their parents stopped letting them talk to me after they went off the deep end. They're now anti-vax flat-earthers who homeschool their kids and believe that anyone who isn't a cishet christian is inherently evil... I may be cis, but I'm an ace wiccan Neither of their kids are older than 10 years as of right now, but the last time I talked to them, they both had already sniffed out their parents' bullshit and were just waiting for their chance to grow up and get away. At one point, they tried to convince me to pretend to be their mom and take them to get a covid vax. I had to explain to them how illegal it was and the heartbreak I saw in them broke my own heart! I know that they still live in the same location, so I'll be giving them Christmas presents this year just to show them that I'm still rooting for them and to troll their awful parents! The presents just contain a pair of hand-knitted pj's each in the respective kids' favourite colours, which the parents can't even be mad about 'cause it's just wholesome. I hope those specific kids are gonna be okay!
Makes me wanna do this when im old enough
There is like 100  Red heads in one part of the school like-
i saw koro sensei and nagisa
The animations are awesome and hilarious
*pew pew*

How much for the cat 😶
I was like boa when I was little but my mom was way better
I think I saw koro sense a
every single gun game in the world after seeing this video: welp were doomed
i’m sorry but i couldn’t stop laughing when she says “karen saunters into the room, *bo in toe* “
There is a stigma around guns that should be dropped. Instilling respect for them isn’t a bad thing. Having toy guns isn’t a bad thing. ‘Bo’ should be able to play ‘guns’ but if he’s annoying the other kids or he doesn’t do ANYTHING else, at that point encourage other kinds of playing.
Koro sensei is in the background
Okay so, I've always been good with little kids. After my little sister was born when I was six, I learnt really quickly how to take care of my sister. My mom stayed home from work to take care of her and when she would get home her and my grandparents would go to the store and since I never liked going and my sister hated carseats (she'd scream the entire time to the point we got pulled over once) it was clear that I would be helping watch her with my dad. Now my dad is almost always baked or stoned or drugged up put of his mind during this time so he says not even 5 minutes after they all left "I need to go get something from the trailer" (we all live in two separate trailers in a trailer park and still do, one for my grandparents, my mom and I and the other for my dad all to himself) so i kept an eye on my sister. He then never came back that day. I told my mom and she cussed him out when she got back. This happened a lot when I was Kid. And because of that I was always great with you younger kids. Once they hit 3rd grade though, that's more hard to control them and keep them from tearing everything up. But I hope one day to get a part time job as a teachers aid because it warms my heart when my sisters friends (my friends little siblings) come up and give me hug at the end of the day when I pick her up. And I'm pretty good at calming kids down and helping with work and basic stuff. I think it'd be fun.
My friend played with guns well water guns and pretend they were real   Me: hey that kid and my friend have some similarities
Is it fine if I play Call of Duty

Yes miss Illisa. (I hope I'm saying that right)
0:30 Luigi dancing made me burst out laughing
I played pretend guns as a young’n, maybe not as young as 6, but I did. However, i also learned a lot about military history, and figured out from a pretty early age that real violence isn’t exactly a bundle of laughs

I love the anime refrences
Did I just see koro sensei 😂
lol i love how almost every animator worked at disney land/world before
Oh my god this reminds me of when I used to teach a cooking class. Eventually I laid down a few hard and fast rules. One, we do not bring up politics nor religion unless in the context of the class itself and even then we do not make fun of any of them. This is largely because I would get fights that go more like “but my parents’ said”  type and I am not going to argue with a kid that has had no time to actually think for themselves and is repeating their parents’ beliefs only. So yeah, that got banned.   Also another rule was about playing with sharp objects or other dangerous things. Guys I think this is obvious. I’m there to not only teach but minimize accidents. I would like the kids to make my job less difficult. Not only that, they risk injuring their classmates, myself, themselves, and also traumatizing already traumatized kids into not working in the kitchen. I can not tell you the number of kids I had to reassure when it came to working with knives and oil in a safe manner that wasn’t just “don’t touch that!” type of training. So yeah.   Then we had the bullying. While I would try to work with finding out if a kid was acting out for a reason, if they made a habit of it, we made a point of kicking the kid out of class to wait for their parents to pick them up and then explain it. One time we had a kid that would do it so often that her parents eventually took her out of class for an entire year as punishment, after making her apologize to the other kid of course. She did return to class eventually and the parents still insisted on paying us the entire year, but yeah, it apparently was an effective punishment as I never had a problem with her in class ever again. Honestly illymation is correct. The hardest thing is less dealing with the children (who make the job worthwhile) but with the adults, especially the parents. My hardest conversations where with dads who would ask me “so when can my daughter take over making dinner?” like it was a forgone conclusion and that he could leave a 9 year old unsupervised in a kitchen….yeah. We would always have to repeat that “we encouraged supervised practice for all our students as it is a lifelong learning process that requires experimenting, learning, and practicing recipes.” These weren’t the only conversations but they probably were the ones that made me bite my tongue the most.  Also I may have banned graphic descriptions of some kids about their hunting. I mean, sure, we teach the kids how to break down a chicken but that’s different from attempting to be as graphic as possible about your families latest deer hunt for the sole purpose of making your classmates uncomfortable. My students did eventually learn to try to be empathetic and respectful of their classmates boundaries but it was a major stretch to say their parents would ever learn it.  And while this wasn’t a hard rule, I did try to encourage everyone to participate. I made it a rule that one didn’t have to eat what was made in class, especially if they had an allergy or religious reasons, but I expected reasonable levels of participation, and for them to at least consider trying the food, even if it wasn’t a food they liked. I would follow this up with a reminder that cooking wasn’t just about eating what one likes but also making it for those we like too and sometimes that means making food we can’t eat or don’t like. Also, for the older ones, I would point out that if they decided to get a job in the food industry, they also would not get much choice in what they were allowed to cook so they needed to learn the right way to cook something and the only way to know that is by trying the food. Basically also telling them they didn’t have to like it or even swallow the food. I provided amble napkins for a reason if I suspected but these kids are adaptable. Most learned to try bits of the food, give their opinion and discuss it, but no longer pretend gag if they didn’t like something. If anything they discussed among each other how to improve the recipe in a way they might like which I loved and ask me if it might work. Their parents were often ecstatic about this part as it would make the kids less picky over time. Can they still be? Sure. But a kid willing to be open about trying foods every now and again, or at least able to make themselves something they do like, is better than one who doesn’t do either.
So.. How Much Anime Do You Want? Ily: YES
aaa ,      Mmm,mmmmmmmm

Bo is actually protected by the second amendment, and that constitutional amendment protects the right for people to own (not use, that’s murder) firearms. Joe Biden is signin the anti-gun bill soon, but okay.
7:24 Everyone (including me) who plays with Nerf blasters: *nervous sweating*
delaney is my name
I love Luigi showing off his dance moves like no one's watching.  He's a funny little bobtail cat with a mustache.
Guns? I think he's been watching 90s tv shows
The mother in this animation did look a bit trashy...
I love that there is a lot of anime in the back round!
I work at an after school program with my mom and all of the kids get confused on whether or not I'm a girl or a boy and it's kinda hilarious.
don't send me to time out in the big kid room 😰
;-: but….but….guns…….
Ay remember that time, playing pretend with gun was a big no no  But thankfully beating the living hell out of each other was accepted
3:21 Isn't that get out face in Italian
When you have a cousin named boe 👁👄👁
NGL I was a 18 year old that decided to go to 1st grade as a teacher and dang was this very relatable lol, kid pretending to play gun is a big no no, and then her mother came over to the school and chewed me out about  "it is just pretend, don't worry about it too much" Me: "but he is pretending to kill his classmates and it is annoying the entire classroom, by running up to them with a block and going *BOP* to them"
I go to school at 9:00
OK I am a kid so you better follow her
R2d2 47 the best gun ever
Please login the dancing cat 😭😭

I don't think I was ever a kid lol mom would tell me how I would let my cousins play and I would join adults to listen to their conversations(parents encouraged me to weigh in, but would want me to defend my opinions)
But you say safe

fun fact before the nasty democrats made guns are scary schools would actually have their own skeet club target shooting clubs and hunting clubs ah those were the times and people were actually LEGALY allowed to bring their gun to school. ah those were the times.
6:52 that must be so confusing for a little boy..
I grew up in a family that goes shooting and makes knifes.
luigi dancing is amazing
But I don’t want to go in time out :c
Other kids: Dinesau! Shwek! Kid 3: GUNNNNNN I imagine that karen with her shotgun collection.
“Like, if you enjoyed this video” “Subscribe, if you wanna see more stuff like this” *”DO NOT PLAY GUNS UNLESS YOU WANNA BE SENT TO TIME OUT”* “And I’ll see you next video”
So are you a homosexual because I am
Noo.    Yeaaaa.    Noooooo YEAAAAA!
Imagine Karen was that woman’s real name tho lol
1:09 IS THAT KORO SENSEI AND NAGISA?
7:24 I just noticed you have a death note on your book shelf … Should I be concerned
0:35 guy from Food Wars! :0
"Don't play gun or I'll send you to the timeout"  Come and take it, girl I dear you!!  I'm a 2nd Amendment supporter guns owner, and I teach my brother to handle firearms since he's was 7 years old and I don't see anything wrong with that. However, I can see why that is inappropriate. Guns can save your life in a lot of situations and can be used for good. But if you don't teach them how to handle it properly it's can be another way around.
Karen doesn't realize that "just pretend" can cause the kid to associate killing his friends with guns to "oh that makes me happy!" He could end up shooting a school when he's in high school
Miss Sheiff seems rly cool
She really Earns the name KAREN
Darn heretics
6:05 is when me and Karen double up on u
2:59 and to these people we say "eat shit and die"
"don't play pretend guns"  *Slowly puts away nerf gun*

I love your videos ❤️
We have a Delaney- everyone calls her Delane the rock Johnson
Some parent are like that
I myself worked at kindergarden and boy it has been the Best job. You understand how clever kids actually are and boy i was jealous. Their biggest problem was that they didn't remember what they ate at breakfast. 10/10 would recomend working with kids
See, boys are boys, and yes it’s normal for them to… to an extent… play guns? But the extent Beau was going to, that’s not normal. See, it’s okay if once in a while they’re role playing Star Wars or something and saying “pew pew!” to one another while running around and laughing, but what Beau was doing was actually inappropriate. It’s not normal to all day every day “play guns” when no one else is. Like that’s actually concerning if as a young child that’s his ONLY interest, most kids are like… play doh, they’re growing up and are being “molded”, they’re all trying new things and playing different games and learning what they enjoy, a six year old should still be wanting to try playing different games all the time, and as I said earlier, it’s concerning that’s the only game he wants to play. I pray he doesn’t carry that interest into teen hood and adult hood, because if he does it’s gonna be more than just using a block and pretending to… “pew pew” at his friends… it’s going to transform into a serious obsession and problem.
devin is me hehe
1:43 How did the captions get that-

I feel sorry for you, the state of the world today, and most of all the kids. My son was subscribed to you but after over hearing this that’s going to change. Peace and love. Peace and love.

This being in the south makes total sense
2:41 YES! YES I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU! Plastic is evil, it ruins the environment. So do landfills, fossil fuels, and CO2 emissions! And global warming really harms the environment.
Are you a pokemon fan!?!?
Delaney is my favorite
1:15 what if I am still a kid

Can anyone else appreciate the Assassination Classroom reference besides me?
global warming IS a myth :/ it’s not real! And I’m not being sarcastic, also if you don’t like what I’m saying screw you,   Also before you start calling me a bad person, I care about about the plastic part and the tree cutting, but not the whole OH the earth is getting warmer because of us and bla bla bla NO,
0:42 ARE WE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THE LITTLE ASSASSINATION CLASSROOM SMILEY IN THE BACKROUND? 1:09 THERES ANOTHER REFERENCE HERE TOO!
I agree with second amendment rights blablabla, but damn the kid is in first grade. His mom Should wait until he’s older to teach him about that
Kids are getting worse tho, a friend held an art class for 7th graders and there was a kid who always was trying to bring guns drawings and robots/armours with tiddies (my guess is on free fire / fortnite skins) because "Thats all he knew cuz thats all whats around his house..." so my friend always took him to the counselor, he got him reported, parents just went 2 or 3 times to talk with her and he ditched few months in, because "his right of free speach was violated"  Guns are very ilegal in my country :u
Use gun 💥🔫
bow sounds like me
the 2nd amendment allow you to carry a fire arm but you need a license with out a license you will get arrested
##
Why does boa sounds like me when I was younger

Me and my friends always got in trouble for pretending to use guns, so we figured out a solution to have fun like that and not get in trouble. And my parents had just shown me a bit of a Star Wars movie. So I told my friends about lightsabers, and we pretending to light saber fight, and we never got in trouble. The end.

Delaney and Devin are adorable
I've worked with kids not as a job but as an extra thing some people could do one year and just helping my mother out with her preschooler. I enjoyed the first a lot but the second was amazing until the panoramic happened because all the kids who adored me where all gone before they'd swarm me and hug me it was really fun now I'm sad and lonely.
ANIMEEEE
*Plays pretend guns* HAHAH I AM ABOVE THE LAW                 *Gets sent to time-out*   ...Shoot.
Okay so the moment I heard how Delaney introduced herself I was like: this kiddo is a cinnamon roll who is adorable and I support her wholeheartedly.
Literally my grade 1teacher was mrs sheriff and she WAS blonde
I was at a park on my phone, and this kid (he looked 7) came up to me and talked about arson. I was *terrifyed*
In the last story, I'm all for 2nd amendment rights but like, its a child? And just because it's pretend doesn't mean it's okay?
Pokémon gotta catch em all gotta catch em all

Guns shouldn’t be taken away cause they are meant for defense even if they were illegal criminals will somehow get them THERE FUCKING CRIMINALS and someone’s gonna rob someones house knowing the probably don’t have gun cause it’s ilegal and there but Biden dosent give a shit cause he want that cause he an asshole and everyone kissing his ass not knowing he’s fucking up the country
DIDN'T YOU SAY IN THE BEGINNING THAT THE BOY HAD A " WATER GUN"  AND THEN A FEW MINUTES LATER YOU SAY ITS A REAL GUN AND NOT A WATER GUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Thank you Devin I love that kid.
Just watched this one.  I'm not a "Karen" about guns and stuff.  But I AM a gun owner, multiple actually. I've gone hunting twice and we used everything we could (I hate ppl that shoot animals just for fun for like trophies or some shet).  I don't have kids, i don't my fiance and I will ever, but I DO believe that if someone has kids and has guns in the same house...well... TEACH THEM GUN SAFETY!!!  Besides, all weapons should be put in a legit safe!!!!!!!  I am pro 2nd amendment, but to an extent...sorry if that irks ppl.  I'm pro weapon, but shet.... BE RESPONSIBLE ABOUT IT!  My nieces and nephews don't even know I have guns, Thier parents do obviously cuz they My fam. But they trust me to watch them cuz they know all the kids will see at my house is kitties, games (suitable for Thier age) a pool table (they still too smol to use) and a pool.
When I was little I watched a lot of star wars and action movies and I played pretend guns😂😂😂

“Some of my friends my age think it’s a myth”  *no more mister nice jesus*
Guys see the Naruto reference at 0:47 on the left shelf top row
You might have taught me
I meyd you in the mii meikar
The rules at my house were that if we're playing with toy guns or imaginary finger guns, we weren't allowed to point them towards real people, only at toys and imaginary people. I know it kinda sounds like a silly rule, but I feel that it taught me more cautious around real weapons. I think it's really important to teach kids to be careful with guns, especially if you have real guns in your household.
sooooooo when i was in 2nd grade we had an assignment to make a form of transportation and put a price on it. I made a... death helicopter... it killed anyone who stepped inside.. uh so thats my violent story.😅 my parents weren't too concerned bc i grew up in a military family and stuff like that :p
“DONT DO IT!” “Ok ok” *Takes out a REAL gun*
"I AM HEREEEE"
1:14 I'm 15 and feel that already
Am I the only one who thot "is Karen bipolar " XD
Don't play pretend guns huh? What if  I play real guns?
I want to do this now
karen is a better name
How you said plastic 🤣
Unmmmmm I think that Devon was me cause I remember talking about that with my counselor 😂
Not tall enough to be anything but a chipmunk.  Vanillope, maybe.
I swear to butts if it was called Adventure Club I would be freaking CRAZY because I go there. I think this year is my last year there it was K-5
She actually hashtagged @almost an adult
When your 18 your considered an adult
I lived in Maine for 9-10 years of my life and got to wield a GUN at 8 FRICKEN YEARS OLD!
So THATS where my Nerf guns went.
Imagine if a kid recognized you tho
I'm going to play pretend gun's
Your teacher was the best ever.
Lol if I was there I will be at the big kid time out place like a 100 or more times bcz I love guns
PollOuTi0N IsINt ReaL
Okay illy
I miss when I worked with kids at this volunteer art center place. I was just an assistant so I didn’t get to teach much but it was fun interacting with all the kids and getting to know a bit about them. I got to work with multiple age groups too so I thought that was really interesting.
pew pew
ok so I play military with my friends ( like the Cold War and stuff) and our teachers are ok with that is that ok?
1:13 scout logo of attack on titan on the pc lookin kinda good tho
Pokémon!!
This reminded me of when I was in elementary school and me and my group of friends were playing zombies ( like imaginary zombies were running after us and the play set things were are bases ) and we were running around pretending to shoot the zombies and sometimes each other ( you know bc we got infected sometimes and turned into zombies ) and then I climbed up ON TOP of the monkey bars to get away from a zombie and BAM, fell off and hit my head hard on the ground. I honestly totally forget what I hurt when I did that, but I ended up going to the doctor and then staying home. KIDS IF UR GUNNA PLAY ZOMBIES DO NOT GET UP ON TOP OF HIGH THINGS, u will fall, and get ate by zombies. Also bc the teacher will run over and walk u inside to the nurse while also telling u why u shouldn’t have been playing zombies again bc stuff like falling and hitting ur head happens
Lol as a teacher I respect this video.
Omg i saw so many my hero acedemia and other anime things i love it
BRO I CANT PLAY WITH NERF GUNS THIS AN OUTRAGE

I do understand why "Karen" berated you. She was using her "power" of age to intimidate someone she saw as "not even a real adult yet." I used to get this as a beginning teacher, and by then I was 23!
*oH, sO yoUr AlMosT aN aDuLt*
I thought  she was about yo say at 2:11 was gonna say "did  not collect $200 on go
Reminder: you should make it here for the Chaos shirt

As someone who’s doing Early Childhood Studies, I could slap an essay on Karen’s face as to why kids shouldn’t partake in violent pretend play.
I bet Devin would love Wolfwalkers. It’s a fantastic environmental movie!
Ms.illy what if I play swords tho
Kids have big imagination and will copy whatever they see  Also just bc it pretended  dont mean it will stop as they grow  up

*does gun hand sign and pretend to shoot my teddy bear* illy: *travels to 6 states and come into my room* Time Out for you missy
“People like you are the reason guns are being taken away from people like me.” First off, I doubt your guns were taken away. Second off, based on your behavior and volatile temper, I kinda think they should be.
I don't think guns are bad thing just how kid was using it it was using it like it was okay to shoot people it's not the gun it's how he is acting like it's a gun that is irresponsible
That cat got sum moves
Karen must be a Gemini

None of my preschools had anime plushies!?

Now that I think about it, I made a pretty good gun model with Mega Bloks around my early elementary years... Or was it daycare idk
Should've just said lasers. They never suspect the lasers.

I got 2 work with kindergartners for a bit in my old school, and monitor their lunch. I knew all the lunch monitors and teachers and it was nice catching up again. What I noticed was that each kid was so pure, nothing like dark humor just kindergartners saying dumb hilarious stuff. I agree, I really like working with the little ones.

Hi misilisa..😂😂
Thats a lot of assassination class room references

You are an adult.... by over 18 you're an adult....................
4:21 top right mha
in my family we get a 22shot gun when they turn ten because my grandpa likes cooking dear meat but he also likes hunting so I guess he want us to go hunting to ?? I personally spas out when I see blood so that isn’t happening but he has 6 other grandchildren so it’s fine.
7:24 oh no how much time do I have to serve now
“Oh, so you’re almost an adult.”
warning, massive warning. (D34th, M4f14, Guns, that kind of stuff)          Guns are related to: • Mafia • Murder • Death • Assassination • Hitmen • Illegal activity • Russian Roulette • Bad habits later in life • Robberies • Threats HHHMMMMMM GEE WONDER WHY GUNS ARE NOT ALLOWED FOR A FIRST GRADER.
As a kid, I had _two_ toy swords and [water] guns, and I thought fighting was cool. So yeah. Interesting. I probably wouldn't even think that it wasn't ok for a kid to play pretend like that - not all the time though, that's alarming...
I like the anime faces in the background
Karens make me want to die
Nooooo! Yeaaaah!
Illy:DONT PLAY PERTEND GUNS OR ILL PUT YOU IN TIME OUT Me:Pew Pew
Did anyone else die at at the fact that the kid said '' oh so your almost an adult''
Wait I was Devin a YouTuber teached me
"I'm going to name her.." I hope she doesn't say karen since that is my name hahahah "Karen" Oh welp....time to get my name changed
Don't play pretend with guns, or I'l send you to time out.   Me, who plays gun games 24/7: IM NOT GOING BACK!
I love how Luigi is just dancing
I saw Assasination classroom references
“What is the most evil thing about the world?” “PLASTIC”
So the bo story I understand about u know the Karen thing and what not I’m gonna be honest wanting to play guns is completely normal for a boy . I would know because I am one. Me and my friends would run around in the backyard with our nerf guns and mock Star Wars blasters “shooting” each other. I only made the conclusion that you didn’t think this was normal because you said he was being very graphic and didn’t give much detail. I would agree with you if he was being graphic(killing children torture etc.) or killing his friends without his friends role playing back just being themselves. But to me it just sounds like a boy being a boy. That Karen girl was stupid tho.
He nice assassination classroom bit
I played with a big block and acted like it was a r2 d2 47
Wheres my time out
1:15 I see Tanjiro, Zenitsu and Nezukos kimono
My favorite line illy ever said   *Maam this is a child...*

So many anime references
I’m sorry but Luigi dancing in the background 😩
The place where I live is full of people like Karen. They rev the engine on their huge trucks and talk about how their rights are being violated. I’ve seen people walking around the grocery store with firearms on their hip and a backpack full of ammo. Is the produce section going to revolt or something?
is it just me or does @AbnormalChaos look like @Jaiden Animations
5 year old me who has 200 IQ: swords it is...

I'm scared of this kid when he goes to high school
The toys were PURE anime
the boy in the last story is literally pico ._.
Love the anime references, you were right to not let that kid violently play pretend with "water guns"
If Devin stomped into the room and did not even grab a Cheez-It and that's how you know that he's mad
if your an 8 year old youll know its horrible to work with babys
You like My hero academia right?
People like Karen created COVID  to make the world worse

Hi
An r2d247 I think you your looking for an ak47
Lol i despise karens who use second amendments as an excuse. At this point i would say “so it’s ok for me to point a gun at u cuz u’re threatening me and according to what u said about second amendments i’m allowed to do so. We can take care of your son and treat as if gun is a child’s play and he grows up in a world where BLM made police reform and stuff, your son would go straight to jail. But since the second amendment still in place i can shoot u for “self defence” 😀”
Bang Bang
i saw myself in the video
What's watch a lot of new ground games and it has guns and now I'm addicted so now I'm playing toy Guns... can I go to a therapist now        JK lol I don't need a therapist

Oh my god Assasination Classroom
Illy: don't play guns or i will send you to time out me: *proceeds to play guns*

How did she not come across the kid that will chug glue like he is dying of dehydration?
I saw the vaporeon
The backgrounds are so cute! Also I love the cute little anime references
Why was there korosensai and Nagasa
I'm pro 2A but if your child has fantasies of killing everyone indiscriminately, we got a more pressing problem.  Also it makes gun owner parents look bad.
I does play pubg mobile and does that count as pretend
I. saw. Mha Plushies. AND. NARUTO TOOO THEY WERE HAWKS AND NARUTO AND ALL MIGHT OH AND I SAW HAWKS HUGGING TOUYA? Maybe? And Deku and bakugo HUGGING
lol is playing a game that is like fortnight or a game with guns count

One day, when i was in kindergarten, the teacher asked us where we wanted to work when we grow up. Of course most of us said doctor, football player, and stuff like that. BUT ONE KID SAID: "I want to be a robber! :D" After the kindergarten, i never knew about that guy. I hope he's not doing a robbery, lol.

Delanie: SUGAR SUGAR  S  U  G    A   R
There are anime children and they are cute
Can't wait to play with toy guns
What about new grounds of shooting games like pico school
No pretend guns? *loads my rifle I use for exclusively for target shooting and points it a my paper target in a safe properly setup gun range* real guns it is then!
I am going to play with pretend guns because *_I ' m  A m  S h e r r i f f  O f  T h i s  H e r e  T h e r e  A r e  T o w n_*
When she said customer service I imagined some kid being LIVID about not having their favourite flavour of juice box 😂
I was five and I already knew wut guns r but I also know that guns r bad so I never played guns
"do you know what the most evil thing in the world is?" Me: taxes , government corruption,hitler  "POLLUTION" Me: ... You right
4:37 “call bakugo’s mom” 😔🤚🏽 rip to the kid
Illy: plastic   ME:AHH PLASTIC.

4:20 top right corner MHA FOR LIFE!
YOU KNOW MY HERO ACDMIA
Bo is exactly like my brother.
I love this video! Kids should not play pretend killing. And guns should not be for everyone. Great story Illy 🙂
I love the koro plush in the background
Why is no one talking about the assassination classroom reference?!? 1:09
I am 100% like Delaney
IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE FACT GON AND CANNARY R THEIR
All the anime hints in the back
0:06 did anyone else see hunterxhunter characters,jujitsu kaisen character?
When the parents are worse than the kids ;-;
That lady was probably a Gemini-
0:09 can We just acknowledge Lori sensai on the laptop
I've gotta be honest, a kid pretending to have a gun doesn't seem that bad.
EEEEE ILLY I LOVE CHU!
P0pppp
i used to have a daycare teacher that looks just like you she was my favorite lol
the  man who was buying the teddies for the kids ( they are on the shelves ) Be like: "ok so we got Naruto ,  koro-sensei , more pokemon then any child needs and all might!"
My art teacher watch your videos 💗😂
I mean- letting a child pretend to have guns and other stuff without getting punishment could make them think that using guns in the future is a good thing? Every once in a while its okay but when a 6 year old child is pretending to be a ROBBER AND SOMEBODY WHO KILLS PEOPLE FOR FUN ITS NOT A GOOD SIGN
I remember I once had to catch the elementary bus to get to school because I overslept. I believe I was about 16, and a young child asks how old I am. I told them I was 16, and they also said I was almost an adult... Basically had thr same reaction. Great video as always c:
I did this face :D  the whole video :D
Ulullllllllllluuululuulllluul
I worked in a kindergarden once for like the smallest kids and I never say that babies are ugly...but this one baby WAS NOT A BEAUTY
Yo you spelled my name right
Plot twist: they actually look like that IRL
we love devin
I wanna meet you in the world :3
ジャパン　Japan. Japanese
Don't worry I'm not playing pretend guns I'm just playing guns
Is it ok to eat guns is that ok
why is this daycare full if anime? lol
IS THAT A HAWKS TOY
WOW
I thought being 18, makes you a legal adult.
Okay Ily I won’t play *pretend* guns
Is it scary that “bo” is super similar to my little brother… he has a bunch of nerf gun, he was in love with gun related stuff…
Anyone notices the walls have Pokemon?
"what's wrong with guns" they kill people? and your son is pretending to kill people???
I will say, living here in Texas most of my life, I really do not get the gun fetish that Texans have.
I love acting like im killing people to
He’s put on course and say
No one:  Luigi: *GET DOWN ON IT*
Play guns u r in time out
I did!
0:29 he groove
Every background well most has anime in them and I love that
Is anyone going to talk about how many anime REFERENCES ARE IN THIS  VIDEO.
I've had a child's aunt berate me for taking the pullups out of the child's bag because she had none in her house to use. I found out later that she did have pull-ups in her house, she just wanted to yell at me. Meanwhile, I was just trying to make sure the 2-year-old child did not sit in a messy pull-up and was out of pullups in her cubby.
Me seeing hawks in the background me:SMSJDHHDNDJSJS
Those kids watching now:wow I was U G L Y                              (Nutshell)
6:00 you: my teacher my mom :  karen me: the child
illy: “DONT play pretend guns or i will send you to time out!!” me: *plays pretend guns* hehehe
Kid: how old r u  illy: 19  Kid: oh, so ur almost an adult  Literally every 19 year old: *destroyed*
House was the only thing anyone did at my school
I don’t get what’s wrong with the gun thing honestly
7:24 Actors in action movies: *sweating intensifies*
HMMMMMM KAREN I WONDER WHY SHE CALLED HER THAT?! HMmMmMmMmMm
Aren't you an legal adult when you turn 18 not 20?
all kids needs gun!! JK
"if you play guns I will send you to time-out"
I play airsoft  do i have to go to timeout
I thought he was gonna say spiders debit
4:39 bakugo and deku and the computer ✨✨👁️👄👁️
5:17 wait, a mother named Karen was actually being a Karen. GASP! What a twist
I don't know, but playing guns seems pretty standard to me. I can understand the behavioral aspect of him being overbearing to his friends and limiting the type of play pretend kids can play, but it seems a bit to much about the guns aspect I'm this video I am getting the impression they might be suggesting that could turn the kid into a skūll-shuttęr which doesn't seem right. I might be wrong or just got weird vibes from this.
Anyone notice that in 00:17 theres an assassination classroom calendar?
You watch my hero acadamya too i saw the pictures 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳!!!!!!!!!!!
DANCING LUIGI   DANCING LUIGI
Future bow: HANDS UP I HAVE A GUN!       Lily: sorry bow, timeout.                    Bow :*aawwwwwwww*

“ How many anime references do you want?” Ilyssa:”yes”
I've been a teacher for 21 years and yep, I've seen many a "Karen" (female and male) in my time. I haven't had a gun one like this but so many others about stupid things.  One particular standout was the dad I had to call about his son throwing a violent tantrum:  Dad: "well, what did you do to set him off?" Me: (already dumbfounded) "I asked him to do his classwork."  Dad: (furious) "you know that makes him mad. Why would you ask him to do that?" Me: (at a loss and trying to refrain from screaming "because this is a school and not Disneyland!")
THE MHA DOLL EASTER EGGS THERE-😭✨
I Hope Karen got banned from the kindergarten
Oh no I'm going to time out
WHAT DID MS. SHERIF DO AFTER?? Thats not just a "no i know this bs" thats almost a "no she's in hot water now"
I LOVE ALL THE REFERENCES IN THIS VIDEO
I love koro sensi
1:09 KORO SENSEI!!!!!
4:39 see those photos ✨MHA✨
I think I would be okay with kids, but I personally don't think pretend guns would be that big of a deal. But then again I'm not a teacher nor do I put up with this. Though the kid needs more variety with his pretend playlist dude. There's more to pretend then guns xD
"dont play pretend guns or i will send you to timeout"  *HAHA YOU CANT STOP ME WITH MY PRETEND KNIFE*
Dalaney is Kelly Kapour from the office.
bro bro bro mah dudes if you went to 1:48 and paused it you can see anime plushes in the shelf
this might be a cultural thing, but to me it's absolutely ridiculous that a way kid plays (while not hurting anyone) is policed so much that he is punished if he doesn't comply. I get talking to the kid and trying to engage interest in other ways, but it seems it's real easy to overreact on this subject in some countries... on both sides of the argument, too.
4:52 lucky him
I grew up with guns and i turned out completely fine. I didnt pretend guns when i was six i shot shot guns when i was 5. I killed my first deer when i was six with a 50 caliber muzzle loader. Growing up around guns is a good thing because i was trained how to use them and i was disciplined. Great video that part just bothered me.
I love the mha Photos on ms sheriffs wall
I love the anime Easter eggs :>
How about N3RF guns
I love you sooo much
I work day care for a living. This is 10000000% accurate.
Her: says DONT PLAY TOY GUNS OR YOUR GOING TO TIMEOUT at the end  me: proceeds to burn all my nurf guns so i dont go to timeout.
"what's wrong with guns?" Oh boy, where do I begin?
3:09 uwah hawks and koro senseiii

I was an assistant drama worker before covid. There was this kid. When we tried to get puppets to covey emotions, he started smashing the puppet into the floor and saying he was trying to kill himself. Me and the other worker in that group (she was 12 I was 16) we're horrified that this 5 year was doing something so dark.
*P L A S T I C*

IS NO ONE GONNA TALK ABT THE ANIME STUFF THAT SHE PUTS IN THE BACKGROUNDS???? SHES A WEEB TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-
Pre-k kids now like to play " bae" which is them trying to make out and touch each other's business and as a prek teacher its very hard to deal with. Also they fist fight constantly because somehow they made it to 5yrs old without understanding empathy or the fact that hurting your friends by whipping them with a plastic snake for a laugh is wrong. Preschool is damn near a war zone.
MHA EVERYWHERE
3:55 i am worse when i was 2nd grade i started watching mortal kombat....................................................................................................

hello 😊
And I saw beau pick up an R2 D247 man that was hilarious
i went to this thing called canpagna and istg it was a 4 hr time out all i could do was read like it was do boring
This reminds me of the time when I was 6 and one of the younger kids swore to me their uncle killed someone with a finger gun....like, they were convinced that they just did the finger gun thing and killed someone with their bare hands by shooting them with their bare hands. Even at the age of 6 I knew that wasn't possible. That a real gun had to be involved or some other weapon or no one actually even died, one of those, cause you can't shoot someone with your hand. Humans can't do that. You can strangle them, you can punch them, but you can't shoot them. Do I agree that pretend guns are bad? No. But be responsible. Teach your children reality from fiction. And definitely teach them to use their brains to know when it is ok and when it is not. At home with your sibling or parent who enjoys it too? Sure. At a public place where you disrupting others who are not into it? No. As long as you aren't disrupting or hurting anyone, I don't care. But if you've been told repeatedly that it is not ok somewhere, then follow that. You won't die from not getting to pretend to shoot things.  That all said, I much preferred pretend swords over guns as a kid and I got a scar to prove it. (Moral of that is, don't use metal poles as swords. Something I will surely tell my future children that if they wanna have a sword fight, they better be smarter than I was about it.)
Did anyone see the corosensei pic
Omg I almost had a panic attack while watching this I kid you not only 6 seconds in I  paused the video and saw all of my fav animes like HxH Soul Eater and also fairytale (I think) like soo cute🥲☺
Theres a kid and he pretends kifes,killers,and gettting hurt hes in time out forever 😏
I watch this video 4 times and I just noticed that Soul is in the background at the beginning of the video
What a little psychopath playing pretend guns at six I was playing real guns at 3
6:25 "and then Miss Sherif comes in...and shot her!" Would be a hell of an ending
Okay I’m scared my character which is literally in my profile picture looks almost identical to ms sheriff
The dancing cat!😹😸

as somebody who was in the after school program through 1st-5th grade i just wanna apologize for all the really weird things we did, ( one time me and my friends snuck into the boys bathroom and took pictures inside and we i kid you not played uno for like 30 mins and then ended just leaving like nothing, keep in mind we did this like once a week) again im so sorry
What kind of person doesn't let kids play with guns when I was 6 I was building lego tanks and driving people over. And I turned out fine like sheesh it's just a purple block calm down!🙄

ok so when my sister was about 8 she asked about dresses and skirts and why only girls wear them and i explained the history of girls not being allowed to wear anything else and she got SO MAD 1. that's DUMB 2. whoever says that is STUPID same thing with racism, she shouted an enraged WHY  and it warmed my heart to know that  she thought it fundamentally wrong despite not being in a very progressive community  she also cried about polar bears dying and she hot so scared ice is melting and she thinks the lgbt is so okay, i wanted to talk to her and she was like yea my fav youtuber is gay i know what that is i'm proud of her

Oh my god the references 😭
what if illy made the kids look like they do irl and gave the same names so its kinda like reverse psychology?
The Karen story reminded me of a time when I was at a indoor pool 2-3 years ago so me my brother and my friend who we found out was also there, from where the entrance is to the pool we were at the back of it and we had been jumping in the water and swimming there for like 20 minutes and once I jumped and I made sure no one was in my way no one was so I jumped all of a sudden this lady and her 3 year old came over in the area I was jumping into and when I came up out of the water she started scolding me saying I should've looked first and how irresponsible I was for almost "stomp jumping" on her child when technically she brought her child over to the area right when I jumped and had already been over there for 20 minutes and looked before I jumped she basically said its my fault she brought her child to where I was jumping and a year later I thought this lady was pretty much yelling at me as if I could have just froze time and stopped my jump >:/  Also the staff once yelled at me and my friends for going in the hot tub since we weren't 18 or adults like bruh its just a heated mini pool what's the problem (no one was in the hot tub either)
me looks over at my brother TO TIME OUT!
I hope the kids see this lol 😂
SINCE WHEN DID YOU BECOME A WEEB??!!!
Me who used to play pretend death star:I am 4 parallel universes ahead of you

Is nobody gonna talk that assassination classroom reference?
I'm 8 and in year (grade) 4
I worked in a daycare for six months, and I can say that even though it could be crazy a lot of times. It was always great when the pre-school kids woke up from nap time and ran right over to give me the biggest hugs. And would always tell me that they loved me before leaving each day. That always made the crazy days a little easier!
hi just hi ellisa love ur vids
I think the reason Ms. Sheriff didn't tell you about Bo's gun obsession in advance was because she thought he learned his lesson. But yeah, that was pretty sneaky of him.
sooo there was a lot of assassination classroom in this one.
I love the little anime easter eggs
I saw a hawk's toy in the background I'm crying of happiness
I saw the anime calendar lolzzzz
I have four kids who believe in the flat earth

I can relate to the swimming thing. My family had to move a lot after they divorced, so I never learned to swim, until I turned 10. I was also extremely petrified of the water. Yup, I was wearing floaties for 10 years. Then, after I learned to swim and I overcame my fear, I realized that I loved to swim, even if I sucked at it. So I try’s out for the swim team, and barley managed to do a 25 freestyle without drowning.  Somehow, I got in. And it sucked. People would brag about how “swimming was in their blood” blah blah blah, while I had just started not being scared of the water literally a week before.  Also, I was slow. Like, really slow.  But, even though it sucked and I was slow, I pushed on.  Now, 3 years later, I am one of the best back strokers in my team.  Not because I was “a natural” but because I worked hard. I never think it’s too late to start swimming, as I now LOVE going to meets.
Pew pew😏😏😏
Ive been a fan of your YouTube for a while now but can you pls make a thumbnail for my videos I love yours btw
My class mates ib 1rst grade where more violent
the part where she was talking about boe and- dolls. There was one kid playing with an aMAAZing doll in a witch costume 🗿
“Why what’s wrong with guns?” “Ma’am this is a child”
At daycare, my teacher would let me sit at her table during recess and show me the parts of various different pieces of software. She was the best.
Luigi is mario's brother
Trust me working at Disney land is not as fun as it seems it constantly feels like your suffocating in those costumes.
The anime references-
PART 2 PLS! Tysm!
See the allmight doll in the daycare , nice reference 👌
4:53 you can see so much anime reference plushies 4:19 there is stickers of mha on her wall
I'm a 16 year old, most people think I'm a 19 year old, I work as a volunteer martial arts coach for children. I have seen the jaws of many parents hit the floor when they find out how old I really am. Also students who find out I'm younger than their older siblings. Luckily, I've only ever dealt with two "Karens". One was a lady who didn't like that their kid wasn't having as much success as the other kids (even though the kid was clearly only there because he was forced to, and didn't put any effort in whatsoever despite all the extra attention we gave him). The other was a former boxer who insisted his daughter be taught traditional boxing even though we teach muy thai (Why not just teach her yourself at home???). There's a local tradition of giving third graders dictionaries where I live, and I went to one of the schools to help out with that and all the kids were gathered in the assembly room and I when I walk in I hear four separate kids all at once say "COACH!"
Because kids aren’t allowed to play with them miss
*me playing warthudner in armored war vehicles. d-does this count?

0:07 look in the background you see gon :0
When you said that a young boy liked to play with water...guns... I thought you meant he liked to play with his, uhm... homemade lemonade...
I worked with kids and yes we did have kids mostly boys who liked to pretend they were playing with guns, I told them to turn it into a water gun, because seriously little boys are going to play guns and telling them not to won’t work even if you put them in timeout, so compromise, make it less deadly and tell them they can’t pretend shoot their friends or other kids.
Yo, dude like every boy was playing army and guns and stuff, and we weren’t allowed to because commiefornia and stuff but it’s like, it does nothing wrong but we played anyway we had so much fun don’t think we are trying to kill people as little kids it’s just being stupid.
Oopsy Daisy I already played pretend gun oops.......🤣🤣🤣🤣

Hi

Plot twist: karen was her real name
R2D2 47 mac 11 45
I think all might was in the background
“R2D2 47 or somethin” now that’s a gun I wanna see
Pew Pew
And the volley ball looks like the haiku
So how was the ending to Assassination Classroom? i cried- alot-

No Illy pls I’m a Texan and Mexican my great grandpa was a rancher it’s in my nature nooooooo pls no
How do you draw your cat looks weird

"How old are you" "19" "So you're almost an adult" Self Esteem Level: *No*
I really liked the patterns in the background of this video! It looks very good!
That kid is not doing good
Man, no more hand guns I guess
i dont see whats bad in guns, i like guns i am only 9 yrs old i like making paper guns since my parents REFUSE to buy me an airsoft gun
Me just just looking around the screen at all the anime stuff 👁👄👁
This is probably the most perfect class ever
*sees naurto plushie* :0 * internal happy screaming *
I don't understand what's the problem with water guns, they are toys not the real ones. I grew up playing with them and I don't own a gun
Paper suck just reture to metal
The soul eater reference makes me happy
"We forget what it was like to be a kid." Me, a kid: So that's why my mom expects me to have a fully-fledged schedule for school homework.
wait if it was kinder idk maybe it was you cuz that was 5 years ago idk i forgot i was a kid
pew pew pew muhahaha
Who else saw the amaazing and laddi being held at gunpoint by bo?
Ye so everytime I looked at the background I saw all might and kiri and I love it hawks 2 there's me and kacchan and well alot
"I was 19, almost an adult." lucky, you can buy wubble bubble ball >:(
Karen watching this:

I don’t wanna go to time out ;(
NO NOT TIME OUT >:(
But your not my mon
Can I play pretend knives?
So real guns are ok
IM SORRY BUT DID YALL SEE THE HAIKYU REFERENCES I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM SJSBSHGD
Guns aren't bad when you need to protect yourself. And the mom should have understanded that her 6 year old doesn't need to protect himself at school, and he doesn't need to pretend to kill people.
I am 7 yrs old and you are probably wondering how I got my channel
4:59 WAIT IS THAT AN ALLMIGHT TOY? AND NAURTO?????
Ha funny ending lobe it thank you for making that joke
All might on de shelf
0:06 Pokémon >:3

its 2021
Me seeing kirishima hawks and all might in the first 2 minutes 👁👄👁
Luigi dancing is killing me
what about NERF guns?
so nobody is gonna talk abt the anime stuff?
What's the most evilest thing in the world? Me: when you trust someone online and you click the never gonna give you up link after they said it was a cute puppy compilation
0:06 is- is that itadori, gon and canary-  *there was so many little anime details omg-*
have you seen koro sensei
me seeing lots of anime references    food wars  me: hold up-
Had anyone notice that naruto and mha,assassination from the back
Who wants to bet “Karen” voted for Trump  (oh god the amount of Butthurt Trump Supporters replying to this..)
Is that the teacher from assignation class room
Do you know what the worst thing in the world is? Oh honey, I was abu- PLASTIC!
I mean, i was told about the birds and the bees by a child when i was there when i was young, so like ._.
It's funny how her name is karen because she acts like one But Luigi: *CHA CHA REAL SMOOTH*
4:40 Touya and Hawks 🥺🥺
Nagisa tho pttt
Illy: Don't pretend guns or I will send you to time out. Me: how about "Don't pretend guns or I will force you to like the video."
im 1289 and un year 600
Well
1:09 OMG I LOVE THE ASSASSINATION CLASSROOM REFERENCE!!!
I absolutely LOVE this style! Keep up the good work! :D
i have used nerf guns am i safe?
The karen cartoon is on piont lmao
*“We forgot what is was like to be a kid”* My mom who had a very traumatic life: *wah-*
I am southern, so I am very familiar with this type of play. But this type of playing is never that “graphic”. Most of the time it’s just nerf gun play, not a bloodthirsty battle or anything.
Devin is a ginger he's always mad
I think all the personality traits of the kids fit my little sis lol
0:35 I couldn’t help but think is that soma yukihira? In the background
OMG UR MY LITTLE BROTHERS TEACHER?!
Cat dancin- btw some hair colours in this vid is not natural so ya prob not real
Kids wouldn't know if ur an adult if ur 19
Did you play genshin impact
love the anime easter eggs
Karen is American
I just graduated from high school and started working on an academy for elementary students as a tutor and I have a lot of problems because of my age since most of the kids treat me as one of their classmate and some of them don't even respect me and don't listen to me , it is really annoying
Illy: I will put you in time out for playing pretend guns  Me with 4 Nerf guns in behind my room door: I know what I must do, but I don’t know if I have the strength to do it
*TIME OUT ZONE*  Comment below if you ever played guns and take your time out!
NOOOO
A keren in da flesh
“DONT PLAY PRETEND GUNS OR I *WILL* SEND YOU TO TIME OUT” Me playing pretend guns be like: ... but i do play pretend guns.....
🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔🍔
0:23 the jackets !! Ahahah
Why are they’re so many anime references. I just started watching anime and stopped watching my favorite animators. I came back and I see koro sensei. BRO I WOULD HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS WHEN I WAS 6
tbh Bo just sounds like my younger brother
One of the kids names is Delaney. My name is DANELI!
“Don’t play pretend guns or I will send you to time out” Lol 😂
I had an interesting talk about toy guns with my boyfriend. There’s been research on violent video games, and found that they don’t lead to violent behavior; however does playing with a toy gun model it as acceptable behavior to shot someone. I only found one article on google scholar (I miss psychinfo from my college days), and it said physical punishment and toy gun play (separately) were correlated with aggressive behavior (the physical punishment part is pretty predictable as every study on it says the same thing). However does banning toy guns do what the war on drugs did, essentially backfire. There’s also confounding variables like do the kids who are gifted toy guns have a different home life than kids who aren’t? One things for sure, this kid was harassing his classmates, which isn’t okay. The situation becomes more complicated when two kids agree to play pretend guns together.
Don't play pretend with guns. Hmm what about nerf blasters
4:39 I like how Ms.Sheriff has MHA pictures in her office 🤣
I knew you were a weeb!!!
Easter eggs that I found:  0:06 gon kid in back   0:40 teacher from association classroom   0:50 anime plushies  1:09 YOU KNOW HIM also he’s taking a pic Of (Nagisa and Goofy)  1:23 Jaiden animations in the back  2:04 the guy from Food Wars by the Shelf  2:13 Jaiden Animation is there A G A I N   3:45 shrek my dude
Don't play pretend guns.....       Play nerf guns instead!
Ok Elissa all thing aside I just wanna know do you ship deku with todoroki or bakougo
Isn't it just fun living in a place where 18 years old is old enough to be an adult
I like the luigi dance      Go go luigi go go
1:10 ASSASSINATION CLASSROOM
I promise I won't play pretend guns Miss Illymation
When the guy called boa went into a room there was MHA CHARACTERS SIEHEGEVYDYSHEh >:3
When I was 6 I was arguing with the teachers about random topics that they got wrong
What what's wrong with guns she will learn how dangerous they are
While that kid was gun obsessed while I was fire obsessed I actually wanted to make a flamethrower out of my deodorant but apparently 6 year olds + lighter+ deodorant = angry parents
Say this 6 years old to me and my friend. We literally couldn't stop anything so we didn't throw blocks.
Am I the only one that noticed the association classroom reference
Me: “Do u like mac sticks????”      Illy: “.......................yes”
Wa-Was that Nagisa with Goofy??
Did I just see itadori
am i the only one who saw the anime easter eggs
Can I like play with my real guns since I'm in the military
Legend says that bo is still In Time out
Honestly I love Pokemon weapons and anime I saw an R2 plushie and I'm sitting with you on all the levels
is anyone gonna ignore the drawing of Illyssa and her friend in the background wearing Karasuno's Volleyball club jackets?
Wait is that soul and gon
I don’t exactly think that kids playing guns is a bad thing when I see the little kids I teach playing a game like cops and robbers or playing war I don’t yell at them or send them to time out I join in and it’s actually fun and that’s all kids think about they don’t think about it as hurting people cause they aren’t hurting them it’s just playing with their friends I’ll in courage them to play different games but in my cute little buddy has his perfect little heart on playing cops and robbers so he can shoot the bad guy and save the world I’m gonna let him and I’m gonna pretend to die and put on the biggest most dramatic show for them it really is just a game they really don’t think of it has hurting people that’s just my opinion about that i wouldn’t personally handle it like u guys did
Kids should be allowed to play guns, guns don’t kill people do
The mother is right you are a pc fun police
Am I the only one how saw all might and hawks in my hero academia on the shelf 😂😂😂
I SAW The koro sensei’s
All of the My Hero Academia stuff in the background makes me happy
That's not Luigi that's mafia luigi
0:52 AYO WHO ELSE CAUGHT THOSE ANIME REFERENCES
THE ANIME THINGS IN THE BG JGKDBDISBSISBDI 💖💖
tbh i was obsessed with guns for a while when i was like 6-8
There’s always that one kid obsessed with guns in the first grade
My name is Delaney
Do the students now you have a YouTube channel?
5:41 because if he play with guns it can efect his future ma'am
2:18 I thought he was going to say "do you know the muffin man"
̿̿ ̿̿ ̿̿ ̿'̿'\̵͇̿̿\з= ( ▀ ͜͞ʖ▀) =ε/̵͇̿̿/’̿’̿ ̿ ̿̿ ̿̿ ̿̿
A month after watching this i finally realized that canary and gon where there
0:41 in the calendar is that from assassination classroom or am I going crazzy ?
You do the perfect way to draw I Karen
yes, 6 year olds who are dreaming about being a hit man and an assassin is soooo fine
3:24 I played call of duty at 5 and I’m still playing it ;-;
ayy i saw that hawks stuffie :)))
♪Luigi doing the club penguin dance♪
Bears have the right to have arms too. iily’s bearsist!
noo illy: yea noo illy: yeaaaa
Pew pew pew pew im killing people with guns
I love seeing the teacher from assassination Classroom
Imagine if you became a tv show.
You have the best backgrounds I swear
When I was a small kid I learned to animate. One day my teacher showed a small movie about pollution and animals mutating due to nuclear waste. It left a mark and I was motivated to make a cartoon about pollution and how horrible it is. I couldn’t tell finish the movie because I graduated kindergarten but what I definitely want to solve is GLOBAL WARMING so our next generation would have an amazing life.
PLASTIC
I mean when i was a kid everyone in class would team up and play cops and robbers and use mulch lol but we didnt do it all the time we would play tag and other more friendly ig games. Kids are curious and thats how playground games happen. But the fact that the kid ONLY wanted to play with guns is concerning and i feel for him. Also the moms 2nd amendment right doesnt apply to children because KIDS should not have guns so that karen is absolutely wrong.
My brother is called bo and he was also really into guns when he was little.......
but miss illy my friend said he would be the bad guy and i would be the good guy and make him... uhhhh go to ground
What was the Karen using guns for though o.0
Omg at 0:49 in the back there’s an Assassin classroom plush, a Naruto plush, and a haws plush!!!!!
I love all the anime references like assassination classroom, MHA, Naruto, and SO much more
🔫👶🏻 pew pew
deivn is cool and you
OMAHGAUSH, my english teacher was called Mellisa/Miss Melissa too
What if i play with real guns
[ *🔫* ]
Enjoyed the vid :D,, good to know that the future’s in good hands. Let’s hope that these kids keep up the good work ^-^  also,,,: Haikyuu, Assassination Classroom, BNHA, Shokugeki no Souma, and more! I love the references XD the fly banner, the volleyball, the pic of touya and keigo,, the little souma plush,, aaaa
Miss Illyssa or Misilyssa
*plays guns* hehehe illy wouldn't know >:)
So much mha references......I'm here for it! My inner weeb is screaming of joy!  All might figure!! Yessssss
“What’s wrong with guns?” -Karen 2021
These kids are assets god bless
Delaney my middle name
Jesus Christ loves everyone including you ❤️❤️❤️✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️
illy everyone played with pretend guns and we didn’t even know what a gun was
“Do you know what the most evil thing in the world is?” Illy:*takes deep breath*
For HS, they made us do internships and I got one at a Metropolitan Family Services | North Children's Center and I got surprised when this little girl low key got attached to me, she would hold my hand and talk to me. Other kids would talk to me to which I Got shook. Low key miss it
I want to be this
I love how you put anime characters as the kids
7:24 ok ok no no pls dont
IM IN A ILLY VIDEO AYEEEE
I will note that imaginary war/gun play is normal young boy behavior and any outright ban on such play is symbolic of poor trends that exist  in the contemporary education of young boys.  There is such a thing as too much obsession and I wasn’t there to judge for myself, and I understand policies (what I would criticize) were over your head. This is not criticism of you, just a general note.
1:09 OMFG OMFG OMFG I LOVE IT
Your avatar is an overachiever. A teacher at 13 wow
*Plays pretend guns*
used to be in school for kindergarden teacher and one of the teachers litereally told me how they allow gun pLaying as theres nothing wrong with it and good for their creatvity :;)
Heh Luigi was busting out those moves
I would have liked to play guns at that age if there wasn’t something wrong with my brain at the time because I’m not going to ever feel happy unless someone else is suffering
I play air soft, does that count as playing pretend guns?
* FANGIRLS *   ITS HAWKS AND ALMIGHT
No one: Literally no one: *that cat dancing like a god*
You not My Mom 😎
Why is there The teacher from Assistant Classroom and Hawks and All might😤😤I LOVE IT😍
why is AbnormalChaos in most of you vids is it your secret identity
*plays pretend guns*
Ya see, we can’t get mad at Bow for playing guns. He only did it because he couldn’t do that with swords. **screaming** SWORD SAFETY!!!     **that’s a She-Ra reference, I don’t condone playing with guns**
I'm never going to time out
I was thinking way worse things
I was rewatching this and we can call that mother miss karen :)
"How old are you?" "19" "So you're almost an adult" *why are we still here. Just to suffer*
pew pew d** timeout!!!!
Bro I love all the anime stuff The my hero pictures in miss sherif’s office The assassination classroom calendar  The assassination stuffed animal The food wars stuffed animal The my hero stuffed animals The Haikyuu volleyballs
Woah, I Didn't Know This Was An r/Entitledparents Video
I wanna be Ms. Sherriff
Her animated stories always put a smile on my face, I couldn't help but see the MHA refs she put in either, I nearly freaked. Awesome! <3
At least your kids were not emos when I was at a after school it was just sports kids and emos rip
When i was in kindergarten there was this kid who also always pretend to have guns and we had this "weapon free play zone" and he always played guns there. We told an adult and then he said "it's a gun that can take people back to life" and he always got away with that
Yeah just play real guns
XD OH GOD! Illy met an Entitled Karen in this story! I feel bad for you, girl, I really do! But as a volunteer worker, I want to say that you did an amazing job with "Bo" and how you put up against the EM! I think half of the people who had to face an entitled parent like that would've just talked back against them, make sarcastic responses or just told them to "F" off!  You were mature enough to not be a Karen to a Karen! Here's hoping that "Bo" will grow up unentitled and more mature than his mom! Ugh!
What I like is that your supervisor/former teacher believed you. I thought she wouldn’t. I also loved how you too shared a moment when you told her about it  “NoOoOoOO” “Yessss” “NOOOOOOO” “YESSSSSS”
“Don’t play pretend guns” Me: so I can play real guns?
Oh you like anime
pew pew
Boe is normal to me i was a toy gun weilding boy but i never took it to far
Anyone sees all might every where 🤔 👁👄👁
this is what happens when a trump supporter is ur parent u get timeout
Roses are red  Blues can give you a flu Now shut up And enjoy the video
pew pew
“What’s wrong with guns?” A Karen is a Karen 🤷🏼‍♂️
YOULL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE *trumpet noise*
Why pretend play guns.
i play gun games so plz no time out :(
Im happy this story is here and not in VoicyHere(channel that usually records entitled parents stuff)
this is what I would say: Some kids don't like playing with guns. (maybe its a lie)
3:08 little naruto awwwww  Edit: 5:07 is that all might?
Kid was like: *MURICA*
DON'T PLAY PRETEND GUUUUUUUUN
Wth
At 0:06 I see, 3 kids in the background in cosplay, Pokémon Wall, and 2 Anime Plushies, so ye.
My mom did before and after school daycare (before the pandemic) and omg, did she have STORIES. There was this kid who was kicked out over and over for his behavior until he was banned from all sites. (From the little my mom knew, it sounds like he had some serious issues and needed medication. He was 8.) But his mom needed childcare, so she MADE UP A NAME, MADE A NEW EMAIL, CHANGED HER PHONE NUMBER, and put down a new address to get him onto the books. Eventually, kid blows up, crawls into the dumpster threatening to kill himself, and he gets kicked out again. But when he did, the site manager found out exactly who he was and who his mom was and the lengths she'd gone to to get him registered despite his permanent ban. Childcare is wild, y'all.
5:07 ALL MIGHT PLUSHIE
2:04 KIRISHIMA PLUSHIEEEE- I WANT
Illy: I’ll call her Karen (I never really got her name) but I think this one fits illy’s quote of 2021 (technically 2020 but it’s 2021 one now
3:45 the shrek doll 🥺
3:21 fuck...     i hate guns, and waterguns
So if you’re 20,you turn into an adult?
I love her little itty bitty fingers poking out of her sleeves.
Pew pew 🙁🔫🙂
I was randomly wondering, what was the people watching this favorite anime reference in this video?(Mine was a picture of Touya and Hawks from bnha)
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the anime plushies 3:08 Also the cute anime pictures in the background 4:20
What a karen
this story is super r/entitled parents
0:06 I see soul eater, Naruto, All might, and many Pokémon plus the other anime looking one.  korosensei and hawks at 1:55.  Karashima at 2:05 Pictures with mirko, Touya, Hawks, Deku, and Bakugo I think I might’ve missed some.  Also she legit met an entitledparant. Wow
These anime references are making me happy-
Gon in the background was the cutest part for me
She’s probably a Trump supporter
If a soma plush was in a school like the one in the animation then these would be some f**ked up kids
If I get 1like I’ll dox the location cause I think I might have been their
Hi C assassination classroom my hero academia and even Naruto
I see Hunter Hunter soul eater and jujitsu kaiser
OK I see that you watch anime now
Oh my God I have to burn my airsoft guns I don’t want to go to time out
Iumba__ and you are literally Nishinoya and Hinata
Illymation:*talking* Luigi in the background:*doing his little dancey dance*
Me: owns a actual gun  Illy: you screwed up buster *jumps out from under my bed* Me: *confused screaming*
You think that kid was bad. When I was a TODDLER I would always have to add a drowning part to whatever i'm playing. I don't know why but I would love to play at the pool for this reason only. I just loved to pretend i'm drowning.
Mmmmm i like the calendar picture  ovo
0:46 naruto and deathnote in background
Luigi dancing in the back lol 1:22
0:48 she put a Naruto, Hawks and All Might pillow in the back. (and the wall with Pokemon)  1:12 look at the stickers on the computer  4:19 look at the pictures in the back                                     (I am a WEEB )
Me noticing the death note in the background 👁👄👁
Lol this sounds more like working with Parents
I love the anime reference. It sooooooo cool.
I don’t like timeout
why did i fell real fear when she said she is gonna send me to time out
Beau will become a gangster in the future
I thought Devin was gonna ask if she knew the Muffin man
In other countries, when you reach 18, you are an adult...
am i the only one who noticed the small anime characters  👁👄👁
Me seeing the touya and hawks,  Bakugo and deku and mirko pics: loud happy screaming*
I keep stoping the video to see all the anime references, love your stuff!
Therapist: dancing Luigi is not real, he cannot hurt you     Dancing Luigi: 💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺 💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃🕺💃    Me: 😵
I played pretend gun pls don’t tell ms sherif
4:20 LITTLE MIRKO LITTLE BAKUGOU AND DEKU LITTLE HAWKS AND DABI AHHHHHH-
The most evil thing in the world is school
Illy: Don’t play Guns or I will send you to timeout  Me: how will you figure out that I was playing that anyway
I saw the haikyuu reference on ms. sherrifs computer!
I just love that there is anime themes in every video, it makes me shed a tear of happiness OvO
I worked with kids over last summer and damn while it's hard it's one of the most rewarding jobs you can have. As we grow up we kinda forget the magic of being small and being able to work with young people of all backgrounds, seeing how they evolve, learning their fears, seeing how much they care. I wouldn't trade my after care hours for anything.
I like how you say karen lol
I WAS A DEMON CHILD AT MY OLD KIDS CLUB!!!! i destroyed everything
This is hilarious 😂
I wonder how many people call illy Futaba...
Me seeing the assignation classroom plush >:))))))))))))))))))))))))
Why kids cant use toys as weapons at school: *E V O L U T I O N*
Yass anime

I love how hawks and Pikachu and all these other anime characters are in the background
Dude, your personality is so bubbly and nice, it makes me feel really happy :) subscribed
As kids, my older brother and i were obsessed with Assassin's Creed, when i was like 6 and he was 10 we'd play assassin's for hours on end...  ...am i a delinquent?
L U G I
What if I play real guns
It's a southern thing. I should know. I live in Alabama.
Adults think they have some power over anyone younger than them
Then beau comes the next day with a real gun: 🔫😀 hi miss illisa
I also worked at a school for a summer job and oh boy. I didn't hate the Kids but working with a large group of kindergarten students  just wasn't for me. The Kids would argue over toys, touch things they weren't suppose to, and throw fits when we told them no. Many would stay awake and make too much noise during nap time which made it all the more difficult. Not to mention dealing with parents. Lets just say I'm not going back to that job. I'll stick to watching my nephew instead
did u ever had a lucid dream
I’m almost an adult this year I’m going to be a real adult
Cat dance.
He likes to play with..... water.        Guns
What about pretend swords?
She lost the opportunity to make the kids the Promised Neverland Kids.

0:47 OMG IS THAT *ALL MIGHT* BACK THERE OMG
Another kid... I'll call *Devon* Me: *bruh*
Looks like the most evil thing in this video is shitty parents.  I feel so bad for the kid, huge school shooter red flags there.  The sense of entitlement is extremely familiar.
That ginger with freckles looks like me....
I'm sorry, but.        *i love the My Hero Academia plushies in the backround*
“NO” “YEAH” “NO” *YEAH*
I feel like the whole pretend guns situation should've been handled differently. Like just make the kid ask the other kids if he could play pretend guns and make him shoot only at the toys they were playing with. You should teach kids HOW to play pretend guns and NOT just take them away entirely because guns might play a part in people's lives one way or the other.

I hate guns with a burning passion but not allowing kids to play PRETEND with things they're pretending are guns is one of the most batshit things I've ever seen. Not even toy guns although that would be fine too. Amazing.
My cousin is exactly like bow
🤢
Illy:*talks*       Luiji:*having the time of his life*
Am I also seeing those anime Easter eggs 😏😏

Devon has finds out about one pollution. Illy: LOVE THAT FOR YOU
nagisa and koro sensei though
I see Hawks Koro Sensei and Alll might and Naruto
The guns aren’t the problem, the whole murdering people and wanting to reenact violent crimes as a six year old child is definitely the problem.  Most of my family (we live in texas) have been raised to both understand how to use a gun and what the consequences of using that kind of weapon can truly be emotionally and psychologically. No person should want to use a gun, a gun should be a last resort that’s being used to protect your own life or the lives of those around you. This child is dangerously misinformed about the emotional, mental, psychological, and legal weight that will come with killing another person. The child sees those sorts of actions as more of a game which means that this child was not brought up to safely handle a weapon. Even if he was taught how to wield a weapon he was not taught under which circumstances it is appropriate to use that level of force.
4:54  am i the only one seeing a bunch of anime references in this scene?  Naruto, assasination classroom, my hero academia, pokemon. Theres probably more that im missing. Im disappointed in myself for not noticing this sooner...
Fun Fact: If you search ilyssa then you will see ilymation
Yes  the Karen has been animated
Luigi means Similar in Jappaneese. And it reminds me of Mario And Luigi.
0:48 Yo, is that Noctowl and Pikachu? From that Noctowl's color, I'd say that's one of Ash's pokemon     from season 3. (  So I'm a nerd. So sue me.)
ive worked with kids too as a circus instructure and it was a roller coaster too with overly hyperactive kids too. and i got the occasional kid telling me i was not a good teature and if i was a boy or a girl but i just let it slide.
i wont play fake guns ok i will just play real gun at school
“Sarge, we can’t hold them.”  “Break out the big weapons.” “Sir we can’t.” “Bring out the R2D247.” “Aye aye sir.”
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaæ
The adult side of the taking care of kids is one interesting place.
Bo and his Karen mom watching this be like : 👁👄👁                     🗿
If that place has Pokemon on the wall IRL Nintendo should legit sue them.
Ya hear dat?  No playing (water) guns or illy WILL send you to time out!!

if i were to be dealing with Ms.Karen i would be like "Ahem just because your child is playing pretend with a block as a GUN, and you let that slide, over, and over, and over again, and you DON'T tell them that it is wrong to use guns, when they grow up, they might grow up to be a killer. *guess who is going to be blamed for it* AH! yes YOU!! why? you may ask because you didn't teach your child that it is wrong to use guns (unless if its in self defence of course) but its not likely for him to not kill for the fun of it!"
6 days.

2:05 PEEP THE KIRI PLUSH
0:30 1:21 *that moment when an animated cat can dance better than you*
Imagine growing up only to find your old After-School teacher made so-so animations on a dying platform.
If I was a child in the school I would just sit next to a wall
I actually had a dream last night where I was in 2nd grade, playing with Zelda action figures, along with other show and game character action figures, in this MCU-styled story, and I kept noticing my teacher was just staring at it from afar.  I paid it no mind until suddenly the room got all quiet during the final battle. I noticed all the kids were just watching the show, right as Link was about to finish off Thanos. I just stared awkwardly. They stared back. The kids even had popcorn. I knew what they wanted, but muscling through the embarrassment, I gave them the epic finale they were hoping for, and I heard a cheer and applause erupt from the crowd.   Later that day, I find a video on Youtube basically explaining their day in your art style, and explaining how originally they were going to shut it all down, but it was just so intriguing, it was like watching a movie, and soon enough, other kids piled up around the little corner I was playing in, and how it was so odd that I didn't notice until the climax of the plot, and how it was awkward even for her.  But this was a dream. (If you see this, please like so Illy can see)
my personality is still like this
I WAS IN THIS HAHAHA
THERE WAS NO WAY I WAS IN THIS IM ANDREW FRITSCHE AKA AS BO AND MY PERSONALITY IS JUST LIKE HIM AND I ALWAYS USED THOSE BLOCKS AS GUNS AND MY MOM HAS CHANGED HER PERSONALITY BUT SHE WAS JUST LIKE THAT 😅
To be a grown-up you legally have to be 18
what app \software do you use to animate . I want to make an animation but I don't know what app to use @ilymation

Ok how much anime is in this video
I found koro sensei in the background lol

The assassination classroom calendar makes this video a whole new level of amazing.  (( I genuinely love your content a ton, keep it up ❤️❤️
I love how there is an all might plushie XD
Im afraid to say this i think she teached me no cap
The hawk plushie in the back is calling me-
this for a cat named Lᴜɪɢɪ huh? nice, im glad you did that because i got to type this
Manipulative brat. Yes I'm calling Karen a brat. What her kid is going is wrong. Needs to be corrected IMMEDIATELY. But for those who will defend her. Her child can play guns differently. Maybe not kill them but just go bam bam then run off giggling. I hate parents like Karen.
Your team is hekin awesome! Also when you did Delaney's voice, that speed and how you were so fluent was awesome.
Zigzagzoon mew Pikachu vaporion and three pokeballs And noctowl

The Promised never land season 2 is out!!
🥰😘
good thing you did not get "karen's " name cause last time i checked I saw you got the death note book in your room so... heart attack
Ms. Sheriff’s art style reminds me of the kid from the “cursed childhood memories” video 🤔
I worked at a before/after school childcare corporation for about a year and I loved the work 💖 childcare can be super rewarding. 💖 But also Oh God, idk how representative my branch was of KinderCare® as a whole, but the back end of things was nightmare. We were always maxed out on kids and understaffed to take care of them. The only direction you could take if you wanted a pay increase (and full time hours) was administrative (aka jumping headfirst into taking responsibility for that back end dumpster fire) 💔 Mostly it sucked to feel so replaceable. Watching all the people come and go from my position wears on the psyche, and the kids too. I finally ended up following suit and leaving for a much better job to start a career in ABA therapy. 💖 It also, just so happens, that I got out just in time with the pandemic, so the kiddos didn't have to adjust to life without me for long. And I didn't get stranded without a paycheck like many of my co-workers.
4:58 naruto, all might and koro :D
I subscribed
can i just jump in the screen and steal that pokemon wallpaper?  Please?
That’s cool she hid some assassination class room character around the video.
*Plays pretend guns*
Thank goodness I still get time out I wouldn't want to get smacked with a belt thank goodness I still get timeout
I agree with the gun thing how is how can a parent say that
Global warming always existed how did you not know that not trying to be a hater but global warming always existed
I love how there are so mine anime references!
Me pew pew illymation time out me pew pew illymation man down man down
W a t e rrrrrrr                          G u n ssssss
Bruh my name is Bo sooo..😅😅
I see your point about the gun thing, but I would say that it is pretty harmless for kids to play like that. I remember me and my friends pretend shooting each other with sticks as rifles when I was little, and that was just for fun. He is a young boy, who maybe played fortnite, and thought it was cool. By the way, I'm from Denmark, and we have had one school shooting in the history of our country, so that could be a reason for my perspective.
pew pew
The anime references are so cute
7:20 there is a death note on the self illy, who are you killing? Also I best writing that “飛べ” took a really long time so good job on that 👍👍
I was Karen
nah you dont wanna work at disney mickey will steal your soul

when i was first grade i played guns with my friends b4 class and itd be always fun cause we only use paper lewl, it was really fun, also sorry for my grammar, english isnt my first language kek

Who else saw my hero academia characters in this and some haikyuu stuff as well
4:19 the mha pictures expressly baby miriko and toya and hawks. Love deku and baku too

How can i get a god animation
Hi
it would be nice if they taught the children what real guns are, and the value of a life. nothing comes close to playing with toy guns, and real guns.  Los niños no entienden varias cosas, espero y ustedes hayan podido explicarle al niño (no a la madre, esa señora ya la perdimos hace mucho)
illy: no gun pretending cleetus kid: i dont understand you

When I was 6 years old I used to play pretend and pretend to kill my classmates and using ketchup as blood 😛
What is the most evil thing in the world?  Adult: "Money, society, corporations, government, Hitler, Satan......." Kid: "Plastic!"
That last story is an EP story
I'm all for gun rights but I agree with you about that kid, just handle it the Caddicarus way.

ASSASSINATION CLASSROOM OMGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!! I love that anime!!!!!
This was filmed on the week of Christmas so      MERRY LATE KRIMAAAAA
I had an after school program thing I went to for “smart” kids called “project create” were we messed with robots and stuff. All I remember was playing with magnets and some kid chugging Mountain Dew when we were making these gummy things. I also met some of my friends there too. I was also that chatty kid who tried to make jokes all the time, I even had a fake standup routine for show and tell, and now I’m preforming it for a community theater thing online next week....so that was a very fun experience and totally recommend for your kids, 11/10
is that a jaiden animations doll?
"I'll call her.. Karen" me: 😏😏
Hi im an old fan
ah yes, the ics jackets :D
Video: kid goes to time out for pretending to kill everyone 7 year old me: hides bloody cat drawings
In my household growing up, playing with pretend guns was alright. That said, we were never under any circumstances permitted to point a "gun" at anyone. This rule was so deeply ingrained that when I started gun training as an adult, I shook when pointing a "gun" at a mock assailant. Not the best way to start in that situation, but certainly better than taking to it naturally~ I am grateful our mother taught us gun safety and impressed upon us the severity of using a gun.
Dang your art style improved
I saw so many anime things
Who else was gon
Quick hide the nerf gun
me: looks at captions  captions: “alright everyone! this is ALYSSA”  me: NO ITS WORDED AS ILYSSA

Let me tell you a small story. I was with my friends house he said that I could try out the BB gun. With targets and I try it out and my aim suck so yeah and I tried it out at the age of 12 or 13 I don't know I can remember lol
4:20 pause The hawks photo is a major manga spoiler for Mha anime onlys
Anime references are cool!
Pew Pew
Lol at the end she said don't play with guns or I well send you to time out am sorry it was funny
Moral of the story: kids are ok. Parents are GOSHDARN STUPID POOPYHEADS WITH A ROTTON INSIDE OUT BRAIN!!!!
Little man pissed  Yeah he sees you dropping that candy wrapper on the ground
Pumped up kicks intensity’s
😃
3:02....        HAWKS PLUSHIE!!!!
I guess I’m going on timeout ;-;
So what ur saying is I won't go to time out for a real gun ..... mk
Well, I'm just gonna leave this story here even if nobody sees it. When I was in 4th grade, we had a "free day" on Christmas. There were these little blocks that you could stick together/attach together. The teacher really didn't care what we did, so we all made a little fort with the chairs and tables, and made 2 sides. Then we made "swords" with the blocks and stuff, and just played boys against girls with sword fighting. Lol
anyone else immediately see the abnormal chaos plushie? no?
In Britain, where I come from, 19 is an adult.
Ayyy Naruto
alright cool vid and all but im gunna go watch the one about the boyfriend
nuuu,  i don't want time out!!  also... whats a gun??
How do you know my address because if you say I’m going to put you in timeout that we didn’t know my address how do you know it tell me if you actually reply to this comment I will get a really big laugh
Ehem-  I saw Hawks, All Might, Deku, Bakugou-  Are you supposedly an MHA fan, Ilyssa?
Did you quit working at this ,@+3 after this story
We did it everyone  1.69M subscribers!

I NOTED THAT JUJUTSU KAISEN REFERENCE. I AINT BLIND.
anyone : Play's pretend guns  illy :YOU PICKED THE WRONG HOUSE FOOL
My friends and I: used to play with nerf guns  Illy: Time out time us:  :c
4:19 omg ok i see kacchan and deku, miriko but whats this.... my boi touya and keigo awwww
''no play pretendo gunno'' me: what if there NERF GUNSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
thats not fair! you get to teach gon????
Don’t worry I only play real guns
So no one sees the all might figure in the place where the kids play And the calendar
Why do people dislike videos for no reason? Seriously there is nothing wrong with this video. (Not including the fact that *KAREN* thinks that playing guns is ok)
is it only me or did i see hawks and all might from mha
I support the second amendment, but I agree letting a kid pretend to murder everyone and everything with a gun might not be the best idea.
Whaen i was in pre k i would play as a murderer who had a gang called spearows and i actually got alot of people to join and my teacher one day came up to me and said "jennie why are you murdering john?" (these are fake names) and i said BECAUSE IM A SPEAROW and procceded to flip her off and she called my mom and my mom legit killed me like spanks lecture pain tried to backhand my face but i got lut juat in time and locked my door
You heard what she said. Bois It is time to stop playing Cod LMAO
My brother name is devin and he almost looks like that kinda? -
3:41 Is that Laddi?
anime
There are so many anime things, like a  naruto and All might plush. Then the picture of Bakugou and Deku 😤👌🏻 like I was just trying to find those types of things the whole time. 😂
This is off topic and all.... but chill out with hawk he's only been in 3 episodes  omg lmao
i know how to use real gun but i  dont have my licence yet so i dont have gun and that good because am really clumsy
Canary, gon, soul eater, sangwoo?
You know somethings up when someone doesn’t collect the cheese itzs
Okay but not teaching kids about good gun safety and telling them why shooting their friends is not okay is a much better option than “you can’t do that” it annoys the everliving fuck out of me that anybody thinks it’s okay to just not teach kids about guns because those people who don’t are more likely going to be serial killers than the ones that do
Welp I'm going in timeout
You like anime',,,,'
I once get sent to time out for throwing rocks over the school
So no pretend guns but i got 2 pistols a grenade and 22. Calliber sniper may i play with that

In my opinion fossil fuels are pretty good, but we need to find another way to for fuel, I don't think global warming is real. But littering is a big problem. I was born in North Carolina, so lots of support in the south for you!

Illy: talks about a nice story and heart warming  Luigi:*Grooving*
I went to the local guitar store a few months ago, and some mother had brought her son in for lessons. They were not wearing masks, and she made a big spectacle about how wearing masks was stupid in front of me (wearing a mask) and the store owner. I wanted to tell her son, in front of her, to make sure to not grow up to be as stupid as her.  Don't know if her name was Karen though.
is that canary from hunterxhunter
I just love looking at the backgrounds cuz there are anime characters and themes it's just fun to see
I Shoot My Brother With A Giant Nerf Gun lol

I see an Haikyuu and Assassination Classroom and My Hero Academia  and Naruto and Pokémon and Demon Slayer and Death Note and Food Wars reference

What about pretend knives?
If you see in the back where the calendar is you can see Korosensei From assassination classroom
*Ilyssa talking about how adults are always stressed out*      But you’re ALMOST an adult.
Holy God a gun and graphiced by words not included   Edit. Karen is horrible

Only a karen would say 'what's wrong with guns'
Sry to say this but.......I don't celebrate Christmas
Dont pretend to play guns      OR ILL SEND YOU TO            T I M E O U T   Make that a t-shirt and ill buy 10 of them
Dalainie represents me but I like purple
I love how much your art style and animation is evolving ❤️
teachers : our job is hard  ilyssa : i love this job  teachers: we were caught lying  me : ahhhahhhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  they were flipping lying
I really don’t fit with happy people. I just look at them and wonder how somebody can be so happy all the time. There is this girl in my class that’s always happy. One time she tried going the main character in a play and school president and lost both and was still happy. Maybe it’s because I’m just depressing to be around and a pessimist but I don’t understand how someone can be so happy all the time.     Oh this was about illy’s kindergarten experience
1:09 nagisa be like
Delaney... Like Dalaina? Btw Dalaina is my cousin
So many anime references
1:09 Wait- Is that Nagisa and Koro-sensei?-
my favorite part was when she said internally "oh Devan. I know a million horrible things about the world. so what on God's Green earth did you find out today?" I can only imagine she was holding back a laugh while she was thinking that
0:06 did yall notice Itadori and Gon??
i worked with kids as well, and guns were a BIIIIG nono for them. one of my biggest rules was "if you make a gun out of the legos then no more legos for you!" and the kiddo wouldn't be able to play with legos until the next time legos get brought out
I´m just happily sitting watching the video and seeing all the anime stuff :D
Wha- I bu- bu- but. I don’t really mess with (toy) guns with intention to think of hurting (or actually hurting) other people. I’m told I’m quite empathetic and I only like guns because I’ve grown up with things like Halo. So... no timeout? Please?
Me seeing small anime references in the background  👁👄👁
7:26 yeah well I’d love to see you try
Ummm, I played pretend guns...        We’re planning a jailbreak boys.
for someone who said they don't watch much anime, you sure make a lot of anime references in your videos
0:06 I never knew you watched anime nice and as always nice video 🥰🥰✨✨
I heard my name in this video and I immediately looked around to see who called my name and then I realized how dumb I was

Okay Karen, but even me and my southern spirit, know that guns and six-year-olds aren't a good mix. Second Amendment rights, sure. BUT MA'AM THIS IS A CHILD.

*plays pretend guns*
Atm this video is at 69k
I WNAT TO PLAY GUNS AND FRICK YOU >:(
The anime toys In the background be like:👁👄👁
1:50 ANIME DETECTED you can see hawks naruto and all might on the shelves in the backround
I don't know, playing pretend guns was not much of a big deal in my house especially when there's nerf or water guns involved. It's like that one story where one child got in serious trouble for making a gun...out of a pop tart. At the end of the day it's just pretend as long as no one gets hurt for real. That being said if Karen had a problem she should've took it to the principle and not be so two faced with you and the teacher.
I saw AllMight Naruto hawks soma yukihira pokemon  and Koro sensei so much anime in kindergarten
My first day at preschool & probably the reason why I have abandonment issues: So I walk in and I ask my mum if she would like to play dress up, she says “okay but I’ll have to go to the bathroom”, I saw my mum drive off. I thought she was going to the one at back home. I waited at that window the whole day 🥲
I don’t pretend playing with guns.... I just grab a nerf gun
Koro-sensei really like to take pictures didn't he.
no one:    Izuku: *why am i not in the background with all might and hawks?* *sad izuku noises*
2:04 kirishima?
1:00 7am? I thought it was a after school program

Are finger guns allowed?
Illy: Nothing scares me. But those things: (Karens and kids saying: so your almost an adult because your 19.) It scares me.

whats that ph beat in the background          im a big fan this is not a hate comment dont hurt me
🔫🙂 pew pew
Omg koro sensei and nagisaaaa 1:09
Honestly, karens like these are probably the reason so many people hate guns.
Besides hitting the dislike button if you don’t like the video just go to a difficult video and dont press anything
Who all saw the anime 🥺
Me:omg this dude
5:05 can we just admire that all might figurine? which one of these kids is the future deku?
Pew pew (the R2D2 rifle
Pew pew pew i am not going to TiMe ouT
I think I had he same problem, I'm not american and having guns is illegal here. My grandpa loves action movies, so unlike my parents who were superrr strict about violent movies and my grandpa's like "Yo, let's watch machete".   So unlike alot of parents who are like " AniME iS FoR KiDS" my parents didn't let me watch pokemon because it was violent a while my grandpa is like "Yo this movie is like super action packed an violent lezz go".  He took care of me more than my parents did tbh and not because they didnt care o anything but the both worked from morning till the night.
Why is Luigi dancing in your house!?
I love how alyssa doesnt know how who R2-D2 is.
I used to take care of 1st grades and I would walk I to school as a 5th grader and then being the only reason why I kept going, I would wait everyday to walk into their class and hear them yell “mom” because they called me that and that was was kept me going until I moved school, it really hurt not having to take care of them and i really miss them so much..
as a gen 3 fan, seeing that zigzagoon made me happy
I saw a attack on Titan sticker on the mirrror
is that girl TRYING to make her kid a potential serial killer? :0
ayyyy you used my name delaney
And if you play with the guns that aren't pretend you will go to really big kid time out where you have to wear orange all the time
her talking   luigi in the back be like:cat jamming                                                                                                if you get the meme you get the meme ok                                                                    ok good
I was an after school teacher also!!!! I loved it so much (I had 20 6-8 year olds to myself it was insanity) Edit (story): one time one of my kids got frustrated trying to read (troubled household was in 2nd grade couldn’t read but amazing at math) so he busted out of the front door (don’t ask me why it wasn’t locked I was just the teacher we had site leads and also it was hw time and I had 19 other kids yelling my name to help them with HW so the second I turned my back he bolted) I used the walkie and my supervisor went to chase after him. 30 minutes passed and he ran into the nearby neighborhood and started throwing rocks at people and running into yards. Cops had to be called lmfao
If I was that teacher speaking to karen would've said it could lead to gun violence when they get older
Is it true Sebastian Stan ate nine cans of ravioli??
The Touya and Keigo drawing 😔💔 4:20 (haha lol so funne)
gon in the background in the begging when the children say hi
It can’t be only me, but I feel like Luigi looks like John Watson from Sherlock Holmes, and yes I mean the series that has 1 hour long episodes.
Korosensi go brrrrrr
I'm sad To
Illy: Playing pretend with... how do I say this.... *WAAAAATEEERRRRRRRRR*
4:19 look at the Bolton board in the background 4:55 More anime references in the background
What devin thinks world war 3 will be like  Humans: We fighting animals this will be easy   Dogs: Hey snakes got a plan  Snakes:  Well all animals team up And fight the humans   Presidents: Send In the nukes   Sea animals: We will destroy the Submarines  Snakes: I Will bite them  Crocodiles and alligators: Well we will bite limb by limb   Milatary: Send in the plastic  Sea turtles: Oh no Dogs: Racoon press the nuke button and nuke North america, South america, And make anartica SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Cold And Nuke europe, Asia, Africa, And Australia  Racoon: did it  One soldier left  Soldier: oh no A CROCODILE    Soldiers dies  Animals: WE WON
My Sister-in-law is a kindergarten teacher and I love hearing stories about some of her students. But by God everytime a parent enters the picture, they are sometimes the most entitled people ever. like the parents of good kids, are like the nicest people. but naughty kids' parents, they are in denial so often.
At the time of my typing this she has 1 mil.69 noice
Watch her name be Karen. Lol
You just earned yourself a subscribe. From me. Congrats! You now have 1 more sub!
I love seeing so many anime characters / references in this video, my favourite was the beginning where i saw 4 anime characters.
Yea Karen is the perfect namw
He's like younger me with that water gun though he may not be gay when he gets older
assasination classroom reference omg ( 1:09)
1:17 Kid: Oh, so you're almost an adult Me: Wait, but, that IS ONE YEAR AFTER YOU TURN INTO AN ADULT!
you didnt warn beau that you knew about the gun rule?  you just waited for him to mess up and dunked him in the big kid jail?  thats kinda jacked.  im guessing beau wasnt so good all around.
You have so many anime references in this video and my goodness it’s killing me- THE LITTLE NAGISA 😭
Did you guys notice all the anime references scattered throughout the video by illy. Lol ^_^   0:06 there is Pokemon things in the back a child animated after soul from soul eater with a Naruto plush in the back followed by a kid animated after gon from Hunter x hunter  0:17 there is a calender with the assassination classroom teacher on it  0:23 there is a picture behind illy with her and her friend posing in haikyuu volleyball club jackets.  0:34 in the right corner there is a food wars plush  0:48 *inhales* Pokemon wall, Naruto plush, hawks plush, all might plush, assianation classroom teacher plush, and two haikyuu volleyballs:)  1:09 assianation classroom teacher and maybe anime kid posing with goofy  1:12 on illy's computer there is wings of freedom symbol Naruto leaf village symbol and the different patterns of tanjiro, zenitsu, and nezuko's cloths. Also one symbol I don't know  1:24 karasuno fly banner behind illy  3:43 I know this isn't an anime reference but the kid on the right in her right hand is holding the God the man himself shrek  4:21 on the bulletin board behind me. Sheriff there are pictures of my hero academia characters. Also she is emailing illy on her computer  4:37 there are two haikyuu balls on the back of ms. Sheriff's computer  Those are all the ones I found. I missed a lot I'm writing this at 1 in the morning. Also the reason I ddint include too much is because most of the back drops are re-used so they have most of the same details.
Kirishima!!
I play with real guns! (and adult supervision) xD
When you started talking about what he likes to pretend with, I thought at first he just played with water and I died on my floor laughing at that 😂
When she introduced Devin I just awwed
2:27 the most evil thing is covid 19
Glad to see you back in the game 😊
I used to play pretending I was a dinosaur who had to eat all of his classmates and teachers. One time it got to far and I ended up biting one of my friends arm... shes fine dont worry xd

Your almost at 2M subscribers!
Plot twist : Luigi was dancing the whole time that’s why illy animated Luigi dancing
I love how she has a lot of anime toys in there 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who else noticed the koro sensei in the background
🤔  💀 🔫😉
2:38 the words of legend in the making  Edit: To explain this he was going off  about pollution and if he works hard enough he can save us
4:19 is that hawks and dabi in the back if so very nice easter egg
Nobody   There is my hero academic stuff animals in the background. Also when the child went to time out there was a photo of kaccaha and deku hugging. There was also a person from food wars. CAN WE APPRECIATE THE TINY DETAILS FROM THE VIDEO.  THERE SO CUTE🙂
Illy I love you your my fav youtuber
there is a korro sensei beach ball in the background
Stop making me like kids they are annoying
Yeah....the parents are always the problem. I know I don't work at a childcare centre but I do work at a small art school ( kindergarten to year 12 but in this story I was workingwith kindy kids)  where some kids do like 50 things before going to art so there tried and don't want to do anything then the parents complain that there kid isn't doing anything but do they think of giving there 5 year old some break in the day to relax or to be a kid and not doing 50 other activities when there 5!!!
Was I the only one who would pretend that there was a zombie invasion with my sister and we would get a bubble gun that shoots bubble and pretend to kill the zombies and my sister would dramatically die near the end to some fake zombie and we did this every Halloween it was so fun
Did anyone see Naruto in the background
Wow that Job sounds entertaining! I would love if kids hugged me and screamed my name. I hope your lockdown goes good. Happy New Year! And to you fellow internet citizens, Have a great life!
Devin is my favorite character in the illy universe
The anime stuff everywhere was 👌
Yo, I see everyone talking about the Karen, but is no one gonna talk about Luigi's little dance and all the anime references??
Lol i just realised that you put a character from hunter x hunter in this vid lmao
THE ANIME REFRENCES I STILL CANT-
Is that Naruto and hocks and Coral sensei
Stay home parenting, babysitting, daycare
illy how about Juny
What about real guns😏
SO if I can't play pretend guns, can I use a real gun instead?
🔫 bet you won’t take me to timeout muahahahahha
being in timeout in 1st grade was like being yeeted to Brazil back then
Claim your:I’m here before a mil views ticket here.
4:20 I just realized the pics on the wall

NO GUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!😡
P L A S T I C
The bow kids mom really sticks up to her name🙄
Koro sensi in back round

UwU
Illy: DONT PLAY WITH PRETEND GUNS Me: cowabunga it is
4:20  There’s MHA photos hang up on the wall
Hold up Koro sensei and Nagasaki are at Disneyland and to anyone reading this that doesn't watch assassination classroom Nagasaki is trying to kill Koro senses on an hourly basis
I spot toya, keigo,mirko, bakugo, and deku at 4:39!!! 😄
Pls don't put me in time out
Im all for second amendment rights. I also dont mind a kid playing war, or cops and robbers. But those games are with other kids playing WITH each other.  But it is a bit disturbing that a 6 year old is THAT OBSESSED with disturbing everyone else's peaceful games with death and violence.
So many anime reference!!!
So, who wants to play pretend guns?
🔪🔪how about pretend knives mwha ha ha ha!
Don't pretend I didn't see that Haikyuu poster in the background.
Dissatisfied parents  *karen?*
Wtf why your cat dance like a alien
I’m also high on sugar   *I love eating candy way to much*
3:36 hawk and that guy from an assasin school and naruto cat ^^
Well if Illy never got her real name, there is a very real chance her real name is indeed, Karen
The plastic kid looks like you illy
My mum works in a nursery so I go there sometimes AND I'M 11 AND EXPERIENCED THE SAME THING   I would talk to the parents because I knew most of them either from the kids or my mum, and this EXACT THING  happened.
i stole the name luigi for my cat i’m so sorry illy💔💔
I saw corro scencie take the picture in disney Correct me on the name And on the calendar in the daycare
5:17 Oh boy, another Karen Moment. Been there Illy, been there.
You probably did not know but on 4:20 there’s MHA pictures up there-
Pew pew 💣💥
Can you pin this
As a person who works with children, even I would say the most exhausting part of the job has nothing to do with the kids. It's the parents who act like kids
Me=pew Kid=oof
1:10 think on the bright side you don’t have to deal with annoying kids wanting picture and screaming
Ily illy haha ❤️
Woo 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 5 stars I love your channel! Wo woo!

t h e   a s s a s i n a t i o n    c l a s s r o o m     r e f e r e n c e s
assassination classroom
Holy hell, she raised the future

all the anime easter eggs: naruto, food wars, assassination classroom, pokemon, and my hero achademia
I see all the anime references
*Mrs.sherrif*
Pretty sure "Karen" is the reason guns can make people particularly nervous.
Do I see hawks?!(from Mha if you know) :0 and narato( I know I spelled his name wrong probs)
Illy: don’t play pretend with guns   Me: no Because I’m 14 and I can do whatever the heck I want
Aha bo is a future communist i see, sovyak bluat comrade

this video gave me deja vu
Who did the voices
I am here for aot
0: I SAW KORO SENSEI
4:20 DID ANYONE NOTICE THE MHA ART
I remember when alot of my classmates would always get into trouble by making toy-shaped guns out of blocks or even color markers (the ones where the can clock on to each other) and would be instantly in trouble. We had a behavior system ranging from Green, Yellow, Red and Blue (the worst of them all) where if you tried to make a toy gun in any way, your name would be placed from Green to Red and that was considered to be big kid trouble.
4:21 peep the toya and hawks drawing on the board 👀
I would walk in and say "hey, you guys know how babies are made." Well you'll know in a few years and be good kids ok go drink your juice boxes  Imma go drink my spiked box
Is pretend knife ok?
I'm just like Bo
lol pause at 3:48 and you can see bo stretching across the room
I knew her name was gonna be Karen the second I saw her and I laughed when that was her pretend name 😂
is illy korro sensei???????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Wait. If I can’t play pretend guns, I’ll just have to play...
I’m going to play pretend guns
This has more than three assassination classroom references    For a video about preschool, that’s a bit concerning o-o
I DIED WHEN I SAW THE HAWKS PLUSHIE💙❤
Ngl I kind of agree with Karen, up until the ranting part.  It IS pretend.  I mean as long as he knows the difference between pretend and real life, it's fine to me.
Bow be like:    PEW PEW SHOTS FIRED
is weird when you upload your real name and every kid would say your name right instead say your name wrong
Thank you. You inspired me to make my own channel.
Do more Soul Eater refersens plss
Wow
you seem to be a bit upcessed with assassination classroom
Hey who want to play guns? :3.                It is just a joke please don't put me in big kid jail

This is your 40th  video cool
I love this. I have an afterschool care teacher I have some crazy kids too
I like how many anime easter eggs you have in your videos cuz like I'm an Anime fan and I casually notice every easter egg😂
At 6:05-6:30 we see how a mob handles a level 12 teacher. At 6:30 we see what happens when a lvl 70 teacher shows up.
I love the way you put in little characters from the karasuno school (I cant remember how to spell the name like hiukui? Idk) but I love the way you just pop them in the background of your videos
I spot all of the anime characters  >:D
1:17 attack on titan logo on the back of the pc❤
Ok, I would literally DIE for Delaney ( I'm not being dramatic, I would)
me kid and 8 yers old
I feel that the moon was not qualified to lecture about guns if her son didn’t know the responsibilities that come even with a fake pretend gun
4:59 snitch
I don’t play pretend guns, I play *real guns*
Oh man as an afterschool teacher myself, I can 100% relate to the parents being like that. I stand my ground though, I've been working there for 5 years and everyone knows me and knows how I am.
666k
0:17 i have a question for god WHYYYY
🔫
Part 2 I would like a part 2

i have a small feeling...just a isty bitsy tiny feeling that you like anime
This brings back nostalgia of when me and my friends used to build guns out of legos lol.
yo kotosence
As adults we forget what that we where a kid. The beginning of the video: so your almost an adult
Kid : how old are you Illy: 19 Kid : oh so your almost an adult  Illy crying in the Conner of the room while kid are still watching are judging her
I whould said to her na stop over here looking like billy eyelashe oh and I see you look as pale as Harley Quinn go play with joker
Kids playing: lalalalalala. the kid with the shrek toy:WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?!?!?!?!?!!!!!!
He picked up a block and he pretended it was an R2-D2      Star Wars fans: (:/
Was that nagisa and koro sensei ? 😂
My brother played pretend guns....           He’s in the army now.
Bo ( that's is name ) reminds me of my little cousin because my little cousin is obsessed with guns.
Fat cat money
The Bow kid is like my big brother, except my brother pretended he was the victim and lied because me and our friends didn’t wanna play that way
Am I the only one who noticed her call the gun an R2-D2 47?
My lil Bro was IN THAT SCHOOL    NO JOKE
Can you play real gun
1:08 theres nagisa and koro sensei
😐(sigh)
I Find illy,s videos so amazing
I can agree with illy about guns, like i mean a 6 year old pretending to use blocks as guns and pretending to kill his friends is bad because he might grow up to be a bad person, but really, that is just my opinion and you can hate or accept, and for the people who hate, I am really sorry that you disagree with me but we all have different opinions, but we should still disagree on a friendly matter 😊
pokemon !
There is A LOT of assassination Classroom  references In This Video
IM NOT GOING BACK TO TIME OUT!!!!

Illy: DONT PLAY GUNS OR I WILL PUT YOU IN TIME OUT Me: *runs nervously away*
how youtube captiosn got all delayney introduction perfectly but cant get slow words of other videos XD
Illy: dont play with guns or i'll send you timeout  Me who was just playing spin the glock: hhmm yes
Why is nobody talking about the anime stuff hidden in this video
Don’t play pretend guns play REAL GUNS
“And he was fuming” Was that a pun?
Illy: let’s call her... my brain: fuck, it’s gonna be Karen isn’t it? That haircut says it all Illy:  Karen My brain: oh lord, this isn’t gonna be good
Did I seeeeeeee korosensei on them calendars lol
2:47 the only thing that differentiates this  kid from I is the red hair and freckles, good lord...
“How old are you” Illy: 19 “Oh, so you’re *almost* an adult”   *listen here you little shi-*
I'm gonna go play guns brb
_pew pew_
New nose!!!
Omg yasss I see a lot of anime characters there!!
Someone called the Child services and the FBI on this woman for thinking murder with guns is acceptable I’m calling the FBI and child services AND YOU CAN,T STOP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Its crazy adults change around young adults versus around equal age or even older adults. Is it like a hazing ritual or something?
You 20? Still a kid.
*Picks up blocks* Pew pew.....my aim is like that of a storm trooper...
you got lucky
Is it me or did anyone else see maaz as a toy on 3:42
That kid is going to kill someone one day and that stupid Mom is still going to defend him
Og's will remember when a stick could be a gun or a magic wand, maybe even a bo staff
So um anyone forgot about all might?
Watched this three times and this came out three days ago
Dang, I'm so glad you got like the ideal experience with working in a daycare environment at 19 (almost an adult). I also had this as my first real job, but I was at first put in-charge as a one-on-one para to a boy with special needs and was given zero training. Then when he went to Dallas for the summer to live with his dad, they pretty much just let me go, even though I had asked to stay on and work with the younger half of the after school kids in the summer... So I went to a different daycare bc my friend had gotten me the job at the old one and she felt bad ig, but all I was delegated to was being the break giver to all of the teachers. And essentially a janitor too... I hated it lmao and basically said at the end of the summer "Hey school is about to start again and I'm not coming back so.... bye"
I played with guns
I'm 19....oh no
Who saw the all might plush
i wanna play pretend with guns > :(  you will never catch me alive!
I love your videos!!!! UWU!!!! YAYY!!!!
NOOHHH  YEHHHHH  NOOHHH  YEHHHHH
3:12 Naruto ( very sorry if I spelt it wrong. If I did please  correct me) and Hawks from my hero academia are in the background. You can see them earlier to but I just noticed them now. 4:19 there's also more my hero academia pictures!!!! 5:06 I keep finding my hero academia! Its all might now.
don't smoke guns or shoot drugs
If this kid's family has a history in the military, or his parents are obsessed with guns in any way shape or form, I can understand, but I don't think it was right for y'all to completely discourage the behavior. Y'all could of talked about hunting, video games he likes to play, paint ball, laser tag, he's a little boy and that sort of behavior needs to be channeled better, not treated like he's a special case.
I was said to Karen that something at home or what you're doing or if you're teaching him we might have to call CPS and even though it's pretend the thought that he's killing pretend is not something a  6-year-old should be doing
No joke I was holding a nerf gun whilst watching this 😳
1:49 seconds that is when we see the all might, hawks, koro sensei and naruto plushies
"DONT PLAY PRETEND GUNS OR YOU WILL BESENT TO TIME OUT"  Me: *pulls out real gun* what about this?
Doctor strange : I have 10,000 anime references,how many do you want  Illy:all of them
Well I played gun games😂 jk The only one I play is shooting zombies Because my friend Danica forces me to
OK I SEE YOU HAIKYUU STAN👁👁
Wait they a more then one ball of sugar in Zaraldo
I work with kids aged 2-5 and the playing guns is a huge problem with the group. They don't even get what they're doing but we tell them no and try to explain it which just makes them want to do it more.
1:09 Assasination Classroom??? 4:59 Naruto? All Might?? Meliodas?? Koro-sensei??
who else noticed koro sensei throughout the animation
“Do YoU kNoW whAt tHe mOst EVIL tHiNg iN tHe wOrlD iS?” Illy: “what?..” “pLaStic.”     *PERIODT*
why do I wanna be a teacher now?

I love all of my hero anime references I don’t know when you started doing this I think it was the swimming video but I love it please don’t stop putting Anime references
I remember when I was in kindergarten when it was someones birthday everyone needed to draw something for them and when it was my birthday everyone knew I loved animals so they drew some animals, except for one kid who drew me tanks and guns and war stuff
I have a confession...     WHEN I WAS 5 I DID FINGER GUNS AT MY FRIENDS WHEN I SAID HELLO TO SHOW THE HOW COOL I THOUGHT THEY WERE I’m sorry please don’t send me to time out

Man I’m all for second amendment rights, but that kid’s behavior wasn’t right.
Everybody here talking about Bo and his Karen mom, and I'm over here hoping Devin is okay. He's such a sweet, passionate, and incredibly smart little guy, and I hope he grows up to do some significant good in the world. With luck, he may very well be the savior of Gen Alpha.
•grabs a block• b a m ✨ b a m ✨
It's not global warming, the earth is just getting closer to the sun.

Omg- koro (idk how to spell it-) SENSI ON THE CALENDAR? IS THAT NAGISA OMG-
I once worked in an after school care too! My mum used to be their only supervisor for years so I knew the ropes way before I was asked to come in to replace somebody who couldn't make it in! That was a really interesting time when I first started, but hoo boy did I think it was worth it :)
I love all the anime stuff in the background😂
WAIT. DO YOU HAVE A JAIDEN ANIMATIONS DOLL ON THE SHELF OF THE LAST BACKGROUND?
i saw that hidden leaf symbol
I remember in 1st grade my teacher set a rule that we couldn't stand on the benches. And one day I stood on a bench and my friend told my teacher that I did that. Of course my teacher was mad that I stood on the bench and made me "clip down to yellow" which means that I had to put the clip with my name to yellow.(If you got red you had to send a letter home and have your parents sign it). I told my mom and she said "What why? That doesn't make sense."
I like the Gon and Canary reference in the beginning
Someone on the other side of the world: Plays pretend gun  Illymation: My name is Inigo Mongoya. you played guns. prepare to die.
i found an Easter egg at 1:17 on the computer the sticker has Tanjero,Nesiko,and Zenizue from Demon slayer
I HOUND KORO SENSEI IN THE BACKROUND
I LOVE all the anime references in this video
I saw though anime references YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME.
I think the name Karen is ok but you should of used a worse name
6:19. Karen: you are the reason why guns are taken away.  Me: umm that's not her fault it's Joe bidens.
some one let bow watch john wick to erly
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE ANIME REFERENCES 😃✋
6:07 broke me...
Do not read the channel name.
Awww man but I'm 24 I don't want to go to timeout I guess I can't play pretend guns      (Q ^ Q)
WEEGEE
Did anyone else notice the toya/dabi x hawks picture at 4:22
😂😂🤗
I'm 10
I thought this was just another Illymation video, then she threatened me at the end, I'm scared for my life to say the least
I aspire to be devon
I'M SORRY DID YOU SAY KAREN
Ooooh gonnn
Is anyone else not even paying attention to the video, but to the MANY anime Easter eggs?
I don't say this often however acted very Karen narcissistic. I grew up around three narcissists and that switch from toxic ranting to friendly chit chat around Sherrif reminds me too much of how they acted throughout my life :(  I realize this was only one interaction involving her,  but that's a huge red flag in my book even if she isn't a narcissist.
The heck is wrong with play guns? Every single kid has played it before
I loved when Ms Sheriff grabbed the mustache
Miss Alyssa she took my crayon MY FAV CRAYON
Yes
Illy does it count if you use toy guns pls say no
The lady at the begining reminds me of the second host from the british baking show. 0:03
*Devon is so me...*
The most worse evil thing in the world: PLASTIC
*"what's wrong with guns?"*
This animation style is my favorite that she has done😊
Illy: DONT PLAY GUNS OR ILL SENT U TO TIME OUT me: *plays guns*
10 yr old me: so you think I am stupid? Adult: yes 10 yr old me : okay so did you know the best wepon is words because they can be used to manipulate people? Also quantum physics is cool so is science Adult:okay uh I will just walk away

Me: chilling and watching with my popcorn, and soda, Me: *Sees the picture at 4:21 Me:*INHALE* SQUEEEEEEE BNHA FO LIFE!!!
One doesn't own emotion, and when one is owned by emotion, it's a reflection of one's belief that one owns them 🔺
Did anyone else notice that some of the kids in the first picture were anime characters. Like the nanny from the promised neverland, spike hair child, and what I think is a naruto character.(haven’t seen lots of anime) Good job with the anime references Illy.
Right after this video I played guns.
People who where glasses look like they had a full transformation into another human being when they take them off...
So many anime references
Uhh... *slowly puts down airsoft gun*
Well since he wanted to play pretend so much now he can pretend like he got caught and sent to jail for his action

i play with nerf guns that means i play ``GUNS`` but you cant send me to timeout bc i live in denmark also i love your vidioes so please make more and continue the great work
R2D2-47? Ya, try the C3PO Automatic Rifle
I grew up in a house-hold where we were taught to use a gun at a young age. It was pretty normal for me, considering the fact I did other chores and what-not that involved weapons of the sort. I also worked in a pasture with my dad so we had a plentiful amount of doe and bucks that we'd shoot. My dad's big on hunting so me learning how to properly use a gun and learn self-defense was one of his top priorities. I'd also have to chop wood with my siblings and I don't want to seem full of myself..- or anything, but I was pretty good with an axe. Basically, by only age ten I knew the kill-points of where to shoot a deer, how to start a fire and to put it out (a skill I'm sure everyone knows-) how to use throwing knives such as a Tomahawk- the best places to camp out and how to survive on some insects and some 'food' I would NEVER consider food, (I went to a survival camp where we were supplied with a few items and we'd have to live off bugs and some certain slugs- no lie, my dad was literally wanting to test out my knowledge). I will just say that my life way strange, and it seemed as if I was living in the 1980's.. or something- and I have no idea how I'm typing this out on an animation about school based off a little gun from a block, but hey... (I dunno). Anyways, I hope those who're actually taking the time to read this that you have an amazing day!
Pew pew I like cookies       Sik I live gun 🔫 ak 47 on my mind

Illy: "With water..." So he's the loser? "...guns." Ah. The video-game loser.
I can only imagine how much joy you've felt after some 6 year olds pronounced your name right.
Anyone else realised how much anime she’s been watching
Hi illisa it’s ilisa

Omg I stared crying because of how pure is Devin
I was helping out in a first grade class once and two kids got into a heated argument about whether or not sharks were real.
I DARE. YOU TO FIND ALL THE ANIME REFERENCES.

Devan reminds me of me
When I was in elementary school we weren't even aloud to do the gun thing with our hands.We were in Britain and most of us didn't even know school shootings were a thing-

So many anime references I love it

Oh I see it's the same no matter where you live... xD Allow me to agree, most of the time the worst part of working with kids is dealing with some of their parents

Imagine being a dinosaur, chilling with your friends, unaware that Ricky raptor would be forced into a red-headed, white feathered farm animal and that Barry brontosaurus was about to be disintegrated, as your lord and savior Abby Anderson was playing god with you, when all of a sudden Micheal Malone pops out with a full auto M4A1, skipping to the finale of the Cretaceous and making his own lead meteor shower, impounding your face with a solid ton of metal, most likely bigger than your entire truck sized body, without any hesitation from the new supreme ruler of the realm. As you, Terrance T. Rex, crawl away wounded, finding the rest of your plastic pals gone and turned red, you see your two overlords fight and push, the gun dropping down near you. Before long, time stops, as a bigger might approaches, this one now putting them to rest. As you watch, your eyes fall heavy. You drift away... Why did Micheal pick up the purple block, on this cursed day?  ~Fin

That football boy is me, i hate plastic in nathure
We once had turf wars with kids from various parts of our town, except nobody tries to take over a turf. They were more like skirmishes.   First it was pretend war.  Then we went with water guns.  Then water guns with squeezed chili in em.  Then pipe-guns with small seeds as munition and balloons as the trigger.  Then BB/Pellet guns.    The one thing I could still clearly remember was every succeeding "war", we would forge an alliance to our former enemies and take on other kids from other towns. Our "army" would essentially grow after every fight lol.
1:09 im sorry. is that- korosensei, and n a g i s a ?
I will never forget my first day of sub teaching. It was a kindergarten and the kids were finishing breakfast. I came up to this one boy who had been eating cereal and noticed an enormous puddle on the table. And I went "Oh no! Did you spill your milk?" And he looked up at me with the biggest shit-eating grin and said "I made it. With my tongue!"   Also legit got the "how old are you" and "do you have kids" question all the time. The worst is when they would respond "that's older or as old as my mom!" The kids question- my answer was just never satisfactory. I would say no, and they'd be like "but you like kids right? why don't you have kids?" Like you can't say "I work with children so much that I realize how much work they are and I would never ever have one."
*Is anyone gonnna tell kids that your technically an adult at 18* oh yeah and Karen saying children can have guns wellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll GUNS CAN KILL PEOPLE hey little Timmy let that gun g-
5:05    Is that you all might? *(In the bg)* XD

0:34 not me thinking that kiri was in the bottom right-
Do nerf guns count as ( pretending )
Um I don’t really need guns because I like to chew on peoples legs and sometimes take a little bit of the toenail and toe
I’ve had a similar job like this! Also went there as a kid myself, I loved my kids and they loved me k-5 and then they go to a teen program 6-12 I saw the middle schoolers whenever they stopped to say hi to me and my boss. Due to covid it cost me my job a lot more earlier than supposed to be. I do plan to stop by and volunteer more often when I can after covid. Though I’ve never had Karen parents they where the strict ones so they’ll listen to us and talk to their kid if they misbehaved or listen to our concerns about them.
So. Many. References. I love it-
4:20 I would like to thank u for all the anime references and especially this one cuz it literally has Dabi and hawks as kids when they were happy and well crap now ima cry  And also mirko and it’s so darn cute ouo  AND DEKU AND BAKUGO AWWWWWW 4:49 THE NARUTO ASSASSINATION CLASS ROOM TEACHER AND HAWKS AHHHH <<333 5:06 ALL MIGHTTTT 5:17 THE POKIMON WALL 7:22 THE VOLLEYBALL UNIFORM SWEATERSSSSS 7:22 miss girl why do u have a death note 😀

Having guns is fine but if your 6-year-old likes to pretend kill people (without it being a mutually agreed game) you aren’t teaching them right
illymation:We always get wrapped in adult life Also illymation:gets to draw as a job
SO MANY ANIME REFERENCES

HAWKS HUNNY GIVE ME HIM
Children should always be be taught how to shoot at the youngest age possible.
I love how you placed a lot of anime references, I was able to recognize them all
this story makes me grateful that the facilities I worked in always had separation of duties. As a counselor, customer service was not my job. All issues involving parents were run through a supervisor whose job it was to mediate. 'my kid has told me lots about you'. no problem? discussing homework goals? no problem. my kid told me you said "xyz...and i wanna"... ok lets have a meeting with the counselor, the supervisor the parent and child to coordinate our stories.  Also in my organization it's almost a unspoken rule that you don't give the kids your actual age. your age is irrelevant to the level of respect that should be given to the position
i love how im just spotting anime figures left and right XD
The anime references tho 😌👍

Karen’s out here making the south worse than it already is.
I worked at Disneyland (Covid lay off casualty) and yeah, we don't have children scream our names and hug us in the morning. Every so often you'll get a really sweet kid who you can do something special for and maybe they'll high five you or give a very unexpected hug, but the "Karens" are far more common than that.
*"What's wrong with guns?"*
I love the little anime references in the background :D

Ugh! Fine ill use a real gun.
I grew up in a violent household, not guns though, and I was a.... verbally violent child. I saw violent things happen and knew that violence hurts people. I didn't want to hurt people. But boy did I not care about hurting others emotionally. Talking about hurting or killing others was just normal in my mind. It also didn't help that my grandpa didn't care about the movies I watched. Being a kid and talking about taking out my friend's babysitter's organs was just how I verbalized that I didn't like her. And from when I asked my mom, she never found my graphic pictures. My point in saying all this is: This kid will grow up confused and possibly really violent. I hated hurting others physically, but thats only because I saw and knew how that ended up. If he doesn't see that, he might not learn until he hurts someone. I feel really sad for this kid.
4:19 yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes 4:54 even more yes
Plastic itself isn't bad, it's the way people are wasteful with it along with other materials. Luckily there are products that are made from recycled materials to help  reduce waste for the sake of sustainability.

Nothing shall stop my list for blood
Omg. I'm working as an after school art teacher right now (just got home from my shift) and while i can't say the hugs resonate (social distancing and all - the kids are really good about it though!!), walking into a room of 2nd graders and hearing them call me Mx. X IS SO CUTE. Also - totally been there w the parents spewing one crock of shit to me and then buttering up the more experienced teachers... not fun
heheh i was a CIT (Counselor in Training) for a single-day Girl Scout camp. Now, on the paperwork to get into this camp, was a statement that kids WERE NOT TO HAVE ANY KIND OF PEANUT ANYTHING ON THE CAMPGROUND, due to them being kids and less likely to advocate for their allergies (i was working with preschool-1st graders here.) So im sitting with my group. Beforehand, one of the girls, had asked me about kunch, because she was allergic to peanuts. Props to her parents for teaching her to tell people. And i assured her that peanuts weren't allowed, that everyone's parents knew that, and that she was perfectly safe. She also has told everyone in the group. And during lunch, one of the other kids pulls out, what looked to be peanut butter sandwich. I asked her what she had and she said 'a peanut butter sammie'. I immediately pulled her aside while i got my supervising counselor. Thankfully, no reactions occurred. I was talking to PB Girl, and i asked her, 'you know that you weren)t supposed to bring that?' and she just GRINNED and nodded. I said 'it could hurt one of the other girls really bad.'. This kid- she grinned wider, and nodded. "i know :)". I can only imagine what her parents must be like (there was no way that that lunch was packed by a 6 y/o.)

I love all the assassination classroom references (it’s my favourite anime)
I like the anime plushies 😅
When i was in 1st grade i used to pretend  power rangers which didn't had guns but people thought it's violent like we were seriously saving soft toys from giant pollow monsters

I could never work with kids. You see I have an urge to slap little snot faced children who think it’s okay to do anything they want.
It was seen as a threat, my school principle called the cops on a kid for making a gun gesture with their hand. I’m sure it was all just staged but as a little kid I was shitting bricks.
The real problem with Bo was that he was playing the *bad guy* whenever he played guns. That's not good. That just sets him up to become a bad person.
Yay Hawk and All Might plushies(?) so much anime references and pokemon
5:14 U know that your mom/lil’ dude’s mom is a Karen when she be lookin’ like dat or somethin
I’m 9 years old and I have a bb gun
Gotta admit, the whole gun situation seems confusing from both sides. I don't get why it would be against the rules but annoying others into playing it and jacking any other game into is would be annoying for the other kids. Also screw that two faced parent.

*pretends guns*
Hey! So I'm actually an Early Childhood Educator, and all I have to say is that I have been put on that situation before. There is a rule in my classroom that we do not have guns at school, and if a students refuses to listen and follow that rule, they sit in the peace corner. Time out is not much of a thing anymore, at least in my state. But parents are the worst to deal with. I'm lucky that in my classroom we have understanding and sweet parents. But in other classrooms i have had parents angrily calling me at midnight because something happened. But I love my job! And I'm glad to see teachers or used to be teachers sharing their stories on youtube!
My name is Delaney and I never thought that someone will use the name Delaney
the title doesn't make sense, just read it over and over again and you'll get what I mean.
I love working with kids, but yeah, the parents are always the worst parts of the job. It's like "ah, I see where he gets it from"😅.

My name is Lilly and I like the name illy so I’ve been using it as a nick name and my sister said I was copying you. I’m not. I just like the name. Do you think it’s copying?
For what i received i passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the scriptures  1 Corinthians 15 3   PS: "according to the Scriptures" - what the Apostle means is that Lord Jesus fulfilled prophecy's of the Prophets of God in Old Testament. There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up dear ones. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of Fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and  pray my friends. Wish you all well🙏amen🙏
To be honest, I was beau when I was six but I didn’t express as much, I just kept talking about Black Ops 2 and was super god damn annoying
amazing video !! Can we get a part 2  ?
I literally have a friend called devon and he is all those things
Uum, I used to play pretend with guns. Like me and all my friends would split up in teams and "battle" eachother. We used to call it the "War Game". It's not what we did every time, but we did it very often. We would use sticks as guns mostly. Sometime we had toy guns. Ain't nothing wrong with that. We were kinda larping before larping was even a thing. Everyone was pretty much ok with that. Well we didn't ruin other kids' fun or anything, all "soldiers" participated willingly. We basically larped counter strike :D :D
How old is she today?
Ah yes. After school care... **flashbacks of being a 3rd grader intensify**
devin really said _"aah! plastic!_

Pretend guns? 🔫 apple took them away but they left 🔪🗡🪦these all next to each other almost like they they these emoji were also use to represent killing and might be used death threats I’m not saying these emoji should be taken either but apple is inconsistent
I have worked in daycare for 15 years, and 5 years ago I switched to the afterschool classroom. I have the 2nd-7th grade but also work closely with the k-2 class. I can attest that this video is 100% accurate! I adore my kids, they are thoughtful, funny, insightful, and full of energy! You always have one that will drive you crazy, and parents are the absolute hardest part of the job!!! I love love love this video illy, I could already relate to you and some of the things you went through as a kid, now this video just made me love you even more! Keep doing what you're doing, these videos are the highlight of my day!

Guess I'm a Bo then. Back in my day though gi-joes weren't frowned upon🤷‍♂️ *there was a karen in this story, but not the one you think...*
This was the greatest quality video I have seen so far but the effort and time and patience this took is so much yet you make so many things like this ^ w ^
I’m 23 with a job, apartment, bills, a partner, and a two-year old son... *I still don’t feel like an adult* .
my brother is eight and he watches historical movies / shows, so he always plays fighting / gun pretend
1rst grade kid: uses blocks as pretend gun everyone in my 3rd-grade class: uses their water bottle and pencil case as guns   illy: you weren't supposed to do that
All these children sound like anime characters
"How many Hawks references?" Illy: *yes*
Iiiiiim here for chaos!
I know this is most likely gonna get lost in the sea of comments bu my therapist tells me I have to speak more even if it's just screaming into the void so here goes...  I noticed some people bringing up nerf guns, and I'm aware (or rather hope) that they are doing it in jest, but there is a difference between pretend k*ll when you're 6 and when you're 12 (and further when you are 18+).  Child imagination is incredible and at such a young age normalizing death and the idea of k*lling others is not ok. You're supposed to develop empathy at this age so that when you're 12 you can have fun playing out a Shakespearean death scene when a nerf dart hits you square in the face.  I'm not a psych anything but most of my family works on education and I've been surrounded by pedagogical material since young.
IM 19 ALLMOST AN ADULT AND I WILL PLAY PRETEND GUN AND U CANT  SEND ME TO TIME OUT *LAUGH IN SITHLORD*
This poor boiyo......his ma will pollute him
When I Was wee I loved family guy and sweeny Todd, blood, sex and knifes... so Guns... 😅 Lol we love some *Fake* guns
When my name is Devin:
Me I shot a gun at 2 years old
Okay I won't play pretend guns I'll play real guns
I'm just surprised Karen pronounced your name right.
0:06: POKÈMON IN DA BACKGROUND YESSSSSSS Edit: Karen makes a point about it just being pretend but he still shouldn't do that tho Edit 2: lol I'm so much like devon
since illyssa's not an adult yet, someone should probably tell her about big boy jail
me watching my little brother play with plastic guns ... just saying I slapt him took his gun and sat him down in the corner and said: dont play with guns ever again
Good luck illy on your job
illy kindergarden teacher:ok class lets take some nap Everybody:yaaaaaayyyy

The early riddle opportunely trick because slave bodily entertain abaft a succinct taxicab. zany, rare cross
My 4 yo. Nephew likes to play with toy guns 😂
Imagine if that room was made of deers. *Wait I’m just explaining Specimen 8 from Spooky’s Jumpscare Mansion*
At my after school, we had like these building blocks you vold put together. And it was super easy to make «a gun» with it. My mum was allways very trict with me not beeing around stuff like that, but I still made guns with the blocks. Guess What? That was banned at afterschool because everybody did exacly as me!
Not everyone should be allowed to have kids. Like we need a license that testifyes your mental health and your ability to look out for another human being
i am about to commit pretend gun
Can i use nerf gun...?        Pwease :3
This is a hidden political message

AHHHHH THE KARASUNO BANNER "飛べ"
Now that i think about even when i was a kid you weren't allowed to play pretend guns in elementary school. If you made your fingers look like a gun you'd get a warning form the playground supervisor. I remember some kids tried to do it in secret but that didn't last long.  I guess when you think about it playing pretend might begin to desensitize kids to the idea of real guns.
Koro sensei!!!!!!!
The anime references just make me so happy
Pew pew 💦🔫
Kids are the greatest! When I got to teach an elective class for all the grades, when I had to teach the younger ones, it was so adorable. They would always call my name and hug me, so sweet. I feel bad for all of them having to live through a period like this, especially in the US.
The haikyuu poster adghshsgsg
Romans 10: 9 [9] If thou therefore confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved
illysa: its weird this kid likes playing with guns so much me:this is america
When I tell you I RAN TO THE COMMENTS when I saw the Food war guy well I didn’t even try to google his name lol
nobody:    me: trying to say delaney's part in that speed
Illy: I'll call her Karen me: hm, interesting choice of name and desing that is definetly not referencing anything in particular
I remember when I used to volunteer as a helper at my college child care center. And at that time I had acne and one day when it was lunch time, one of the girls ask me what was on my face. I turned to my get an approval nod from on of the instructors. She gave me a nod of approval and I explained that sometimes when growing up you can get pimples. And the girl was like," I'm never going to get pimples" I wanted to laugh so hard 🤣
I wish u were my teacher so badly rn
Holy crap Luigi is doing the Toontown victory dance
*_i thought the title said "My summer as a school teacher in an affair" 💀_*
"Kids Are All Right" is the name of a webtoon... I wonder if Illy was referencing it?
3:38 was that a hawks plushy?!? I have found another simp in the wild.
2:28 me who loves nature: GIVE. ME. THAT. ADORABLE. CHILD.
Cod Mobile check my channel 🙏🏾‼️‼️‼️
Illy: I used to be a teacher  Me: how the frock did I not know dat
At first when she said "To protect names, identities and privacy" I thought she got spornored by NordVPN. lol
One time we went to Vietnam and my dad got to use a R2D2 47.
I'm playing pretend guns my right toooo 😝😛
There’s so much naruto references  hunter x hunter  naruto soul eater
-silently plays guns-
Will I go to the big-kid time-out if I play gun-videogames?
Hate to say it but little kids tend not to genuinely hate things. They have things they dislikes, but they don't hate. If Devon was genuinely bothered by pollution, he got that from his parent...
Okay, I only discovered illy a few days ago. BUT I DIDNT KNOW SHE LIKED HAIKYUU?! LIKE NOW SHE IS MY NEW FAV YOUTUBER :D
Kid: Miss Illyssa? Illy: Hm? Kid: How old are you? Illy: I'm 19! Me: wait...what?...whAT? HOW ARE YOU 19??????
Karen 😂
My aunt used to work at a daycare, she quite enjoyed all the little kids and their energy.
*plays pretend guns*
All the anime references  🙂🙂🙂😁😁😁
Not Ms. Sheriff, with BakuDeku and Dabi (Touya) x Hawks pics on her bulletin board.That I wish I had.
The amount of anime references I found
Good job on #21 on trending
I SAW ANIME STUFF I SAW HAWKS ALL MIGHT AND KURO SENSEI!!
The name of the first kid was so triggering to me I didn’t watch the video till today and I turned the volume down :\ love your art and story’s fellow red head
As a 19 year old that works in an after school program I feel the beginning and Karen part in my bones
claim your here before a million views ticket here 👉

5:10 No good things last forever
*pew pew*
im finding out that im older than like every freaken youtuber i watch lately
kids are the best bc they have no filter and come on so strong... but that also makes them the worst.... love you illy <3 <3
Merry Christmas
When you're homeschooled and you get to miss out on this
As a person who worked in a day care for 3 years now I feel all of her pain   Also instead of "Time out " I would just say " ok you really like guns but other children are upset so we should set some rules and consequences when you break them" so at least you will teach them responsibilities
0:41 i see fuckin koro sensei, i just finished all 21 books, highly recommend
Merry Christmas!!!!
the kid must have been so confused seeing the mom's behaviour. damn, i hope he won't grow up being exactly that type of person :/
1:22 Luigi is just vibing over there
plays pretend guns : pu🔫pu🔫pu 🔫
Merry Christmas
Funny... My brother and I played guns as kids. We haven't killed anybody. Definitely think you guys over reacted. There are lots of dangerous things kids play pretend with  I guess we should get rid of lazer tag, nerf guns, water guns, and paintball 🤷🏻‍♀️
Anybody else realize all the anime references
Me: instinctively does finger guns to indicate my approval Illymation: BIG BOY TIME OUT
I kinda want to work with kids when I’m older mainly because I know how much an adult can affect their lives, and shape them into who they become. And some kids really do need a stable adult, an adult that is kind to them and teaches them right from wrong. I really do appreciate the people who work with kids because they’re the future. I feel that is why things like racism continued, because the parents of the child tell them that people who are this certain way are evil, or people who look like this should be frowned upon.  This is another reason why it’s so important for a kid to have an adult that is stable, and make sense. Because if they’re not the kid will turn out just like them and think it’s okay to call people certain names based on what they look like.   Once I had a foster sister and she was like 6 or 7 and she told us something that really broke my heart, she said “I thought every adult goes to jail” and I realized how much she has went though, how much the adults in her life have changed the way she things, effected her daily life. No child deserves that.
Bro if anyone made or did anything that resembled or referenced to a gun during school, you would get suspended on the spot. Shit was insane,, like one time a kid got suspended for POINTING, NOT EVEN MAKING A FINGER GUN, BUT _POINTING_
That child at the beginning just made me awww.😊😄
I just saw canary gon and soul at the backround XD
<3
"But why are guns bad?" MA'M ARE YOU JUST NOT GONNA CARE THAT YOUR CHILD PLAYED AND ENJOYED THESE FANTASY GAMES ABOUT MURDERING HIS FRIENDS! BC THATS WHAT WRONG WITH GUNS. THAT, IN THE WRONG HANDS, THEY END PEOPLES LIVES. THAT'S BAD.
Gun owner here. We don’t claim Karen. Kid shouldn’t be pretending to *kill his friends everyday*. I mean, we’d play cowboys and Indians sometimes but only when everyone was on the same page. Not just randomly double tapping some poor unsuspecting kid 😂😂 and definitely not every day
I pretended guns but I hat toy guys in hand not blocks
He was just learning how to be American
0:06 wait is that soul in the background
Anime references in the video: 0:37 On the board theres koro sensei-0:51 on the shelfs theres naruto all might and hawks and pokemon on the walls-1:15 on the back of the computer you can see tanjiros zenitsu’s and nezukos cloak patterns-4:40 on the pictures theres heroes from my hero academia

Who else noticed at 3:18 that there was a Hawks/Keigo Takami plushie and Naruto in the background.
Tbh this sounds really fun job.
Pew Pew
I do this but with HS students and man I feel you!
I’m a teenager and I feel Devon. WE’RE expected to clean up the economical and environmental messes when we had absolutely nothing to do with them? Boomers ask, “Oh, you kids are so depressed. Go outside, play!” Maybe we wouldn’t be as depressed if we knew that we wouldn’t have to fix all of these screw-ups in a few years.
I love all the hidden anime's in the animation and I really like your vids
3:42 I like the shrek doll
AYE I SEE ALL THOSE ANIME LITTLE HINTS IN YOUR NEW VIDEOS AND I LOVE IT 🥺💞✨

Was that a Hawks plushie I saw 👀 0:48
0:07 is that Jean from attack on Titan and that dude from hunter X hunter? Poor jean he looks horrified
It’s funny how to background plushies are all from anime I don’t think kids should even know what they are
The kid with the gun is awfully familiar to my friend...
What if he played real guns

Dancing Luigi gives me life!  Phat cat money indeed.
*inhales dramatically*  Was that Nagisa from Assassination Classroom!? You have my respect.
I am just going to say kids are more willing to use violence against who they perceive to be a man.
Illy: “Don’t play with pretend guns or I’ll send you to time out!”  Me: *Hiding all my nerf guns*
pls can u start uploading more often? only if u can and want to! I really enjoy your vids and I'd like it see more!!

Kirishima
I used to babysit my siblings and also some of my neighbors' kids and it was hard at first but I got used to it and sometimes their behavior didn't match from when their parents told me.
is nobody gonna talk about the mha/assasination classroom/naruto refrences?
can we hear more stories from this? I found it very entertaining
🔫heh
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
i did this but lifeguarded
The National Review magazine published the article “China Accused of Harvesting Organs of Uighurs, Falun Gong Religious Group” by reporter Zachary Evans on September 26, 2019.  The article reported that a human rights lawyer has accused the Chinese government of murdering members of the Uighur Muslim minority and the Falun Gong religious group to harvest their organs, and has urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the allegations.   Hamid Sabi, Lawyer and Counsel to the China Tribunal  Hamid Sabi is a China Tribunal lawyer. The China Tribunal is an independent panel founded to examine the issue of Chinese organ harvesting, headed by British Lawyer Sir Geoffery Nice, who previously led the prosecution against Serbian president Slobodan Milošević.  “Forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience, including the religious minorities of Falun Gong and Uighurs, has been committed for years throughout China on a significant scale,” Sabi told the U.N.H.R.C. on Tuesday.  The tribunal’s final report on the matter details abuses committed by the Chinese government, and asserts that the government-sanctioned doctors to “cut open [victims’ bodies] while still alive for their kidneys, livers, hearts, lungs, cornea, and skin to be removed and turned into commodities for sale.”  Falun Gong, a religious practice based on meditation, has long been banned in China. Its practitioners are often imprisoned.  The article points out that organ transplant waiting times in China are extremely short. This prompts overseas patients to come to China for treatment. The tribunal concluded that based on Chinese organ donation laws, the organ supply should be much lower than it currently is, if the donations were truly voluntarily.  Reuters also reported on September 24 that Hamid Sabi, Counsel to the China Tribunal, told the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) that the harvesting has involved “hundreds of thousands of victims,” mainly practitioners of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement. He added that detainees from China’s ethnic Uighur minority were also targeted.  Sabi said, “Victim for victim and death for death, cutting out the hearts and other organs from living, blameless, harmless, peaceable people constitutes one of the worst mass atrocities of this century.”  Geoffrey Nice, the tribunal’s chairman, told a separate U.N. event on the issue that governments, U.N. bodies, and those involved in transplant surgery, could no longer turn a blind eye to the “inconvenient” evidence.
7:14 As a pre school teacher I can tell you for a 100% fact this is how teachers gossip

Sounds like the main problem of you working there was dealing with the parents not the kids 😂😂😂
This has been my job for the last 4 years while I finish my teaching degree...and these kind of talks are a weekly if not daily thing. Not usually about guns since that’s not really a controversial issue in Australia to say it’s a big Nono...but there’s always something
"i will call her ✨karen✨" at that moment i knew exactly what type of person she is
I work in childcare and the worst part is dealing with ignorant parents
I just found tanjiro zenitsu and nezuko's clothes on a sticker on the computer to the bottom right of the fma humunculi symbol
Nobody:                      Luigi in the begining: *Danceing like a god*

Oof. What a Karen.
I feel like the kids pretend violence was more the issue than him pretending to have a gun. That mother was spouting nonsense.
Who else sal all might at 1:49. If you need help look at the background

I love this video that you made I think you should make more of your teacher abilities there
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Romans 6:23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. Amen. Repent and turn from sin! Follow God's sacred 10 Commandments! Time is running out!

I love all the anime references like for Naruto and My Hero Academia!
So we aren’t gonna talk about how basically all the kids in the opening are anime characters-
ILL NEVER BE IN TIMEOUT YEAH 😝🤪

The level comfort simulteneously hand because giant explicitly sip by a exotic balance. tiresome, highfalutin floor
Anyone see all these anime Easter eggs?

Always love looking in the background of your videos and finding so many anime references and stuff and it's amazing thank you so much for making my day just by the background
Those kids watching this video: 🥲
5:00 ah, I see you are a woman of culture too. (Referencing the anime plushies)
Pew pew 🌝
hey illy! i see you watch assassination classroom!!! i love assassination classroom!! its my favorite!!!
Pew Pew
Honestly I think that little dude who was taking abt pollution with become a humanitarian when he gets older and you know what........     I’m not angry about that I would actually like if he did so if that kid is seeing this good on you little keep going and hopefully you’ll be the next Greta thunberg
I worked at a kindergarten for a little over half a year when I was 21 and this speaks to me, especially the part about coming in at 7am to a dozen smiling faces who all run at you and hug you yelling your name. Never had any issues with the kids or parents thankfully.
A lot of people are commenting that they played "guns," "war," etc as kids and that it's a perfectly fine game to play, and I agree. My brother and I had pretend battles and played with toy guns and swords and all kinds of things as children also.  But there's a difference between "playing war with your friends who also want to play war" and "violently intruding on other children's peaceful games and making it about murder and death which then makes everyone else uncomfortable." So I'm definitely with Ily and the Sheriff on this one. 😛
1:57 was hella confused as to how she knew my name asfghjhdf
WTF is she crazy
Guns are a-ok for protection,, 2nd amendment ya know?  But the way the way Beau played guns was...
Truly terrible example of a gun owner, there is a set of five basic gun rules and one of them is know what your target is and what your willing to destroy. There is a stigma about guns but the problem is dramatizing firearms when they are a very important tool for protection daily, be that dangerous wild life or criminals that mean harm. The point is stop letting your kid watch dramatic violent tv and let them play outside. And if you take a kid shooting teach them safety at all times and the 5 basic gun safety rules.
Your videos always make me happy,smile,laugh so I wanted  to say thank you 😀
I'm honestly conflicted as to whether or not "violent" pretend is okay. When I was a kid, we did it all the time, but I can also see how instructing kids on what is and isn't inappropriate behavior is necessary.
0:06 *SOUL EATER INTENSIFIES
The anime references are immaculate illy
Me watching the day after my six year old cousin got fake guns for Christmas: 👁👄👁   So I’m not the only one who thinks this is kinda wrong-

One doesn't own emotion, and when one is owned by emotion, it's a reflection of one's belief that one owns them ❤️
Hey I just wanted to say that not all 2A people are like that mom. I have a number of real guns and if I ever see my kids (If I have any) doing that anywhere in public especially with other kids that I don’t know.Time out is the least there going to get.
We get it you watch anime!! Can go back to the old character design and stop putting so many anime references
Is that Koro Sensei
I went to a monisorri, and I always got to play with the dollhouse (by ma  SELF) because I "did the most learning activities".   I did nothing besides be adorable and feed pretzels to the schools cats and birds.  I miss those days.
R2-D2 47. That is golden
Am I the only one who sees the the  assassination classroom characters in the back😂
that lady kind of scares me haha. Like, a gun is a weapon it should be handled with respect. I’m very concerned she’s not going to teach her kid that respect, yikes.
I just realize the picture that she has in the back has her and her friend wearing haikyuu. Jackets That made my day
OMG IN THE CUPBOARD I SEE AN ALL MIGHT PLUSHIEEE!  Illyssa- you have T a s t e
I’m gonna do it >:)             *plays pretend guns*     Lol
You know it's been a hard day when a kid walks past the snack table
UR TRENDING!
Hey am player pretend while watching i dare give me time out
✨🔫🔫👌✨
Lol, I actually lived in a house where pretending to use a gun on a person wasn't ok, but on Imaginary animals was fine. Yes this was my childhood
1:21 i thought little illy was supposed to be satan
Huge 2A advocate here, I grew up around them and still to this day hunt and shoot as a hobby. Guns are NOT a toy they are a tool and should be treated as such. So a 6 year old playing guns and always wanting to "shoot" the other kids is a big no from me. Nerf or airsoft or even paintball are fine but the kid should wait a bit till they are at least old enough to understand why they shouldn't want to shoot someone.
Me:*makes finger guns* Illy: FBI OPEN UP
I’m sorry to say this but your profile pic looks like you uhm never mind 😄 🙈
Don’t play pretend guns
Karen: WHY Can’t he Pertend to Kill his Friends  illy:  ma’am This is A Child O.O

Yayayayyayayyayayaaayaaya
Beau: 🔫👁👄👁
I promise I won't play pretend guns, cross my heart and hope to die. I just really don't want Illy to send me to time out.  :P
R2-D2 47
I love all the anime references
I don't agree with punishing the kid but I understand you have a job to do. I thought the mom was out of line as well. I have a parent like that and let me tell you how infuriating it is when your parent start getting into a political debate with your teachers. It ends up making the kid have a harder time at school making them feel more isolated and it's the worst feeling in the world.
7:26 “Don’t play pretend gun or I will send you to timeout”.. ight let me play with real gun
Its nerf or nothin
5:05 okay this ones for my fellow anime fans but I’m pretty sure that an all might plush right 😂
This is just so good

Me: *looks at Mom character*  Me: definitely a Karen Ilyssa: Let’s call her.... Karen Me: I FUCKING KNEW IT
The amount of anime references and easter egs makes me so happy🥺
*P L A S T I C*
*starts playing guns*
Ok all the anime things in the background made me so happy
Ahh, the 'She is new so lets push her around and see how far we can get" approach.
5:06 oh hi allmight
I mean, I used play pretend guns, I turned out fine, the mom was the real problem, she was defending 'real' guns.
So glad I work on a closed campus this year so I don't have to deal with Karen parents in person. (they still get into your work email tho)
Missulissah
She was 19 and this is 19 on trending
illy i worked in childcare for a decade. this brought  me  back.  and i have a couple funny stories i wanted to share with you.   one time after the kids saw tangled for the first time  they started smacking each other with the frying pans from the play kitchen and  hurting each other, when i threatened  to take it away from one particular  kid  and put them in timeout.  they pointed it at me like a sword and yelled "i will use this" i let it go after that too hilarious. i didn't  have the heart to punish or (correct) her. i told my boss that i dealt with it.   another time we served dinosaur shaped chicken  nuggets for lunch (if youve never had these they were beyond delicious  i always snuck a few) when a little girl who was the daughter of my dads work buddy asked for more chicken nuggets after i served the last two. i said i was sorry but  we're out and offered her something  else. her face falls and she slams her fists on the table and yells "GODDAMMIT"  my super was pissed but im in the kitchen laughing  my ass off. later when her dad picked her up my super told her what happened and he also laughed his ass off. as far as i know she diddnt get in trouble  i probably  wouldnt have punished her either.
i love how you make cameos about anime
How am I not subscribed??       Edit: I subbed
Jeremiah 29:13 You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart ❤️
4:20 when it flashed by I was like "wait did I just see hawks on the board or am I going crazy" I can confirm I am not going crazy
Wow! I had no idea you were working with Abnormal Chaos!
"why not play with guns?" CAUSE KIDS WILL REMEMBER THAT MOMENT THEY GOT IN A FIGHT WITH THEIR BEST FRIEND AND 'pretended' TO SHOOT THEM DEAD.
hey illy will you ever work with kids again?
*Pauses call of duty*
So only if I play pretend I get time out..so I'm that case.
I will never stop playing with guns
wait you were a teacher?
I played pretend guns all the time as a kid, all of the kids in my school did. Now im 21 and i own real guns. I don’t see a problem with playing pertend, the problem starts with bad parenting and a lack of knowledge and respect for guns.
God I’d love that but I get over stimulated by a lot of noises and loudness... reason for me not wanting kids, but kids love me and always want to be near me and see what I’m doing or drawing XD
Im lovin these anime references
Did I see Nagisa Shota? I love assasination classroom
Those two kids in the beginning got more personality than me...dang it...im jealous
1:09 hi nagisa and korosensei
Funny is very funny 😂
the amount of anime references in this video is immaculate
“Ma’am this is a child-“  The way she said that, I CaNt EvEn...
I SEE GONNNN
My favorite thing about watching her videos is finding all the anime easter eggs, I got soo excited when I saw Keigo from MHA lol. There is also Naruto, Haikyu, AOT, Pokemon (Sorta an anime idk lol), Hunter x Hunter, Jujustu Kaisen, Assassination Classroom, Food Wars,  Death Note and Demon Slayer. Girrrllll you have taste, we would be such good friends lol. Oh I think there was Harry Potter too, bc of the doll the kid was holding but not too much to go off there lol.
Oh my God, that is a Karen.
anyone else notice the all mite plush
I didn't know that I needed Nagisa posing with Goofy but hooo boy...DID I NEED THAT IN MY LIFE <3
What in the heckity? When I was a 3rd grader, I played pretend with two other 3rd graders and pretend guns were involved. (I think it was some sort of a duel situation?) We all got told not to do it even though that is arguably less problematic than what the kid in the video was doing, and no parent got involved. Is this an usa thing again?
I think I have spotted an  assassination classroom reference EDIT: that's a lot of anime holy shit
can i call you mom ouo
Check out my book on my channel
Hay kid you can’t play with pretend guns, this is America, here you can borrow mine.
These videos are always so pure. I love them!
2:12 IS THAT ABNORMALLY CHAOS
I saw Nagisa from assassination classroom
Tbh kids playing pretend guns isn't really a red flag for me... Buuuuuut ONLY ever playing pretend guns is. Maybe we spend half of playtime pretending we're growing the dinosaurs THEN we play idk save the students from rampaging dinosaurs? Mix it up a little? Some Jurassic Park action?
Looks like Karen has 2 personalities😂
*Whispers* hey guys want to play 🔫  pretend guns
THE QUOTE IN THE DISCRIPTION🤣
Yes a video!!!
I think
Omg I was in your class
* plays pretend with finger guns * bet
Ms. Sherif: no! Illy: yeah Ms. Sherif: no!! Illu: yeah!
NAGISA???????
Is no one going to point out the hawks plushie in the background OvO    (Not just hawks but an all might and I think kirishima one too)
NO NO!!!! I WANT TO SEE MS SHERRIF DESTROY KAREN
Did you have a kid named Chris because I had a teacher named Alyssa
I still love how illy adds anime characters like my hero academia
I guess I'll stick to swords
YoU cAn'T sTop ME! *pew pew*
You got karen spot on
Does she know that video games with guns exist 😅
It’s funny because guns kill more people than terrorism every year and it’s these people that cause it
Am I the only one who saw hawks and all might lol
I mean I believe in the second amendment, I’m even fine with kids pretending to play guns but we use those experience to teach gun responsibility not to kill people but to protect 🤷‍♀️ personal opinion though
this video screams secret weeb nation lmao
The worst part about working with kids is their parents by a mile. My mom says it as a teacher, and I can attest by having worked at an amusement park. Parents fucking suck
I think I’m Devon I was 6 so I can barely remember you
I remember playing with nerf guns and squirt guns, but never at daycare/summer school. Altho we had really aggressive water balloon fights and played dodge ball, which is more dangerous at that age? Lol
i seen four anime kids
🔫 pew pew 🔫
My sisters used to say I was an adult in training
My sister got a fat cat purse for Christmas, so now she too can that fat cat money
And Zigzagoon...
Why is there Mew, Vaprion, Pikachu, and Naruto
0:51 narutooooo
pew pew pew 🔫
This Christmas I got a Koro sensei Mug + book, after I that i go on YT and see this on my recommended list, so I click on it. 0:40 seconds in I see Koro sensei in the background.       WHAT IS HAPPENING
*Pretends to play guns*
Merry Christmas everyone
Lol! So reletable i was a swimming instructor and its was so?fun
Well kids nowadays are more knowledgeable than normal but not GUNS (also I’m surprised that only one kid talked about climate change cause for me everyone knew)
The amount of anime references in this video amazes me
ALMOST THERE, ALMOST AN ADULT
I love the assanation classroom reference
Was that All Might five minutes in
naruto and Kuro sensei in backround
This is so relatable! I am an RECE (Registered Early Childhood Educator) so I have seen a thing or two. I’ve had the same kind of issue with whole inappropriate pretend play thing. I’ve have three boys (between 4-6) who would play a game about a monster with sirens on its head and that eats people. It was getting so out of hand that I had to talk to their parents and keep on reminding the children that this kind of monster isn’t allowed in school. I redirected them with more positive roles like police officers, doctors, superheroes, etc. It has helped but sometimes I still do have to remind them about games that involve hurting people and redirect them.
0:06 Gon and canary
*has raygun and slowly puts it away* uhhh, yes ma’am. Btw love the content I’ve been here for a long time
Ily why do you have a death note who are you killing

I love the amount of anime references.
*sees koro sensai at the Disney land* Weeb mode*activated*
I have to play guns because I got a nerf gun for Christmas eve
For a short time I helped out in my schools After school program too. I didn't really like the job as I was kinda board and when I was helping a kid it was usually with spelling, which was probably my worse subject.
Some kids are smarter than you think. While others ... aren’t the sharpest tool in the shed.
My summer as a babysitter was great-
OoOOO HAPpy CrIsMaS
pew pew ajajcrf gggx     hi mrs sharif
Don’t worry, I’m not fully American
me: sees this: WELL OH HO HO!
Is it bad that I thought of something completely different when she said "Water Guns?"
Damn Luigi can really dance
Yup this is what working with kids is like, as a daycare teacher, can confirm😂
*proceeds to play guns*
Illy: "Let's call her......Karen." Me: *listened to way to many Entitled Parent/People stories* "Oohh nooo"
Theres a all might and a assanation Classroom plush
some parents are insane. once, when i was volunteering at my local daycare, there was this girl who was constantly causing problems for absolutely everyone. of course, one of the teachers told her mom, hoping that the ADULT WOMAN would PARENT her child.  instead, we heard the mom tell her child that she was in the right and that she absolutely did nothing wrong (which is incorrect). that child is going to grow up to be a massive brat and my heart goes out to her.
4:20 :0 MHA ART
But I play airsoft with THE BOYS
I spotted the hawks reference and screamed cuz i am a fellow hawk simp also the hawks and touya and mirko
I always played pretend where I would kill a bunch of shit with guns and swords

Guys- FOOD WARS PLUSH IN THE BACK WHO JUST NOTICED IT-
Is pretend dinosaur OK?
I LOVE how you put anime characters in the background
DUDE?! Big kid timeout?!!? 😧😧😧
1:09 ASSASINATION CLASSROOM VIBES
Lisa: Play guns and you get time out.  No MERCY!!!! Me (with a huge Mass Effect obsession): *sadly walks to the Sheriff's office and sits on a stool while Ms. Sheriff works. *
The kids watching this be like 🤩😇😳
Pew pew
imagine being vegan, now your a vegan art teacher
I just noticed that Naruto was in the background😅😅
I was serving at my church and a kid said that Santa is fake and he was 4
does playing pretend guns mean i cant play fortnite anymore
When I was working as an after school art teacher some years ago I was told I was old and unmarried..... I was 21
Well there is nothing wrong with liking guns it you are thought how to use and taking about guns
Merry 🎄
Anime Anime everywere
Tiny children hugging you in 7 in the morning ok just from saying that I wanna work at that place soon I mean TINY CHILDREN HUGGING YOU
🔫
I never Played anything With guns, Only weird Fantasy powers And fake Sword like Things, instead I played House..but I was The dog. Don't worry It was By choice, I feel like I should've Seen the Furry thing Coming tho..
i’m honestly terrified of kids  THEY ARE DEMONS
why was there no whose here for the chaos.   I mean I’m sure here for the chaos
Merry Christmas
I saw Koro-Sensei at one point and like—😌✋
I get that it’s not great for there to be super graphic things in kids’ pretend games (like really gory descriptions of gun wounds and stuff) if it’s upsetting for the other kids. But some schools do go overboard with the rules. My little cousin loved to pretend things about soldiers, pirates, superheroes, Star Wars, etc., and just about ALL of those games were banned at his school. I don’t know if all schools are like that these days, but that’s overkill, right?
Just me or do you all think devin locke like Ron from Harry potter
I once shot a gun........pls don’t come for me
Anime references so far:        pokemon, soul eater, Jujutsu Kasien, Assassination classroom, hunter x hunter, Sherrif Callie ( the sheriff reference counts), Micky mouse clubhouse/ Disney land, Mario, Naruto, My Hero Academia ( tell me any that I missed) HOW COULD I FORGET, the last  anime reference Is Jaden Animations
0:45 can we talk about the asasanation classroom tjing ?
Did anyone else notice the all might plush
but what if its actually guns
my brother and I used to have nerf guns we would play with and every time it was dinner time my mum would have to say "no guns at the table" and I find it really funny to look back on. Pls no timeout
Fun Fact: Not at all like Disney parks @_@   9/10 times I get "WHERE GET FASTPASS? WHERE GET SPACE MOUNTAIN!"  But to be fair, I work in TL and it's a mad man's rush to get those fast passes for a decent hr. I also worked at an after school program but for 7th-grade kids who had zero interest in kiddie arts and crafts so when I let them design haunted houses and some kids did their favorite scary movies like Freddy Vs Jason (Not even joking) parents loved it while I got written up by my supervisors for not curbing their designs early on... I ended up quitting, I was not suited for that role.
Thank you. I needed this. A reminder that the internet has some incredible, wholesome things.
This whole time I just looked at the Zigzagoon on the wall 😂
Oh! so many references. love the Assassination Classroom and everything else!
Oh boy, I did one of these for Illy’s last video and I’m gonna do it again.  All the references I noticed! Tell me if I miss any.  0:07 Pokémon on the wall in the background (left to right- Zigzagoon, Mew, Vaporeon, Noctowl, Pikachu). Canary (wearing a suit) and Gon Freecs (green spiky hair) from Hunter x Hunter. Itadori Yuuji from Jujutsu Kaizen (pink hair). Soul Evans from Soul Eater (white hair). Naruto plushie in the left shelf, All Might plushie and a volleyball resembling those used in Haikyuu on the right shelf. 0:09 Plushie of Soma Yukihara from Food Wars and Korosensei from Assassination Classroom on the bulletin board 0:22 I don’t know who the other person is in the image in the background, but in it Illy and them are wearing the brand of clothing from the anime Haikyuu 0:30 the books in the back read as follows, from left to right: Nen 101, Justu Guide, Mayhem, Death Note. I don’t know where the other book is from, but the Death Note is a reference to- well, Death Note, the “nen 101” book is yet another Hunter x Hunter reference, and the jutsu guide is a naruto reference 0:48 Korosensei plushie and Hawks plushie on the right shelf. Another volleyball from Haikyuu on the left, I think? 0:53 the banner from Karasuno High (Haikyuu) above the picture in the background 1:09 Korosensei taking a picture of Shiota Nagisa (also assassination classroom) posing with Goofy 1:13 Stickers on Illy’s laptop: Survey Corps coat of arms (Attack On Titan), symbol of the Hidden Leaf Village (Naruto), the pattern on Tanjiro, Nezuko, and Zenitsu’s kimonos (Demon Slayer), and the Hommonculus symbol (Fullmetal Alchemist). A poster for Cats is in the background 4:20 Images of My Hero Academia characters (top left, Rumi Usagiyama. Top right, Katsuki Bakugou and Izuku Midoriya. Bottom middle, Hawks and someone that I don’t know lmao) 4:37 Ms. Sheriff has stickers of Haikyuu volleyballs on her laptop and a sticky note on her desk that reads “Call Bakugou’s mom!”
I remember when I was 6 I used to play The Ten knives and guns with people and they used to gently pretend I was killing Them brutally and talking about how violently I would snap their necks like like twigs guard now looking back Jesus I was a mess up 6-year old
4:39 the photos 👁👄👁💕
Kid: "ma'am are you a teen or an adult" Illy: "yes"
0:11  Okay something similar happened to me:   Okay so I was at Walmart once and I was looking through some clothes with my friend and some little kid came out of nowhere and asked how old I was so I told him I was 18 (at the time I was 18 but now I’m 19) and then the kid said “you don’t look 18 you look younger” (the reason why he might say this is cause I’m short for my age lmao)
Cool kids
Pew pew no timeout for me  😂😂😂😂
When I saw Nagisa taking a picture with goofy I was like  Yasss!
This girl is a literal closet weeb
Hi
4:35 That's what they did at my kindergarten too😂
Pretend guns pfffffffft, I've shot a real one, and HATED IT..... Soooooo, no guns for me🤣🤣
7:24 do i see the karasuno motto in the background...?
Merry christler
Ummm, Mrs Karen? The guns aren’t the issue here, it’s the violent pretend and descriptions that follow that’s the issue..
'I can't play with pretend guns,,,, but would she let me play with real guns?' I think to myself, in my childhood bedroom in Europe, far away from the US and their weird weapon rights
illymation: Don't play with guns, or I will give you time out Me: *gEtS tHe KnIfE*
koro sensei in the background
All of the my hero academia stuff in the background made me laugh so hard😂😂😂
Wonderful video Illy  I hope you have the best holiday ever and thank you for all you do discovering your content this year was such a wonderful thing as I laughed and learned so once again thank you
I remember when I was in first grade, I think, We had to make a story about a turkey. I live in the kind of household that has a strong knowledge of guns and such. Anyway, I had to do this project not long after the second Despicable me movie came out, and I drew my turkey with a lipstick taser. My teacher knew about my father's occupational status and our family so I think she let it slide. Thinking about it If I had any other teacher that could have gone bad
I think that at least one of us has played with guns in a after school and/or place for little kids
Bo’s mom haircut got me on my knees and laughing 😂
pew pew, extinction part 2
Oki no guns i like playing pretend knifes thats not allowed ether? How about REAL KNIFES HAHAHAHAH
*pretends guns* pew pew🔫🔫🤠🤠
I would love to see more videos of your time in this job!
Nobody: Me: *Notices Illysa’s feet*
The misogynistic Karen stereotype you are pushing with this video is just dumb and harmful.
I honestly love this video, keep up the good work! I am having a stomach ache and landed upon your video! *plays pretend guns*
There is nothing wrong with guns... it’s just how you use them and who you use them against 🤦🏻‍♀️ Get this Karen out of here. (Talking about the mom)
oh no
KAREN WHHHHHHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH ........but yeah you do have a point thats accurate
I have a nerf gun-    Does that count-
oK OK i not be  a bad kid uwu
My youngest brother is 6. He enjoys indie horror games, creepypasta, and various other inappropriate things for his age. I have to keep my parents from hitting play on certain things because I know they're too graphic, even for him. I just- I don't even know how he found out about it when he can't even read! I tried to relate to the little dude, by turning his favorite game BATIM into something educational, which is hard but not impossible. Apparently, I'm his favorite sister, but I just- HE'S SIX
Nervously laughs*
4:55 all might in the background got me realizing in not the only anime freak
If you’re 19 you’re a kid , you’re not an adult  You shouldn’t have thought " remember when we were kids " because you still haven’t left that phase , you’re just at the end part of it.  Living alone doesn’t make you an adult  Working doesn’t make you an adult Being an adult means you have to take FULL responsibility for your self and others and still manage  And how you know you have full responsibility is when you fuck up bad and you’re the only one who can take you out of it , you don’t have to fuck up to be an adult, you just know.  At 19 you couldn’t be further. Maybe number doesn’t decide it but 19 definitely does
At 5:07 there's an almighty plush
Merry Christmas!! It’s Christmas morning here at 5:15 !! Haha 😂 It’s Connecticut here lol
So all the Anime reference: 0:07 pokémon 0:23 k-on (0:23 abnormal cahos) 0:35 food Wars(soma) 0:39 assasination classroom (koro-sensei) 1:09 assasination classroom 1:15 nartuo sticker on the pc 1:50 nartuo plushie koro sensei plushie ol-might plushie

Koro-sensei!
Lol there are HunterxHunter in there.😂
Honestly, next time that happens I feel you should record it and send it to child protective services. I'm sorry but that women should not be a mom.
Assassination classroom in da back 0:10
“How old are you?” Illy: “im 19” “So your almost an adult” Illy: that hit hard
I FRIKING LOVE ALL THESE ANIME REFRENCE THINGJSJDKDKDKDMMDNSMSKSKWKKWW
Lol im like Kevin I HATE POLLUTION AND EVERYTHING THAT HURSTS THE EARTH.
Gun kid is going places
Not that you’ll see this but, both my sister and my mother are early elementary school teachers and I get allll the stories about parents lol and the fact that I’m probably going to education as well scares me in that regard😂
Im in middle school now and one time when i was in 6th grade, me and a bunch of my friends were being told to take care of the lower grades in a sort of story time sesion were the actuall teachers take a break and let the 6th graders watch them, so i got sent to handle 4th grade kids and lemme tell ya it was so much fun, despite being 2 years younger then me at the time they were so kind and fun, they would listen to my story for a whole hour and keep beging for more the next week (ooh and by the way this was a 1 time a week thing and it was only for an hour), even when i got moved shifts to another grade they refused to let me go, and said something on the lines of "no, she is our story teller and she isn't going anywhere but here" and honestly that was so sweet of em, i miss them TwT
I hope illymations doesn't catch me with my water gun👀
Yow mayo man that is theamazing is here
So, my family had guns. I was raised around guns. About 10 I was being taught gun safety with a tiny little BB gun that was kept under lock and key whenever my dad wasn't around. However ... My dad didn't even allow us to point a actual water gun at each other because, in his words, "He never wanted us to get it in our heads a gun was a toy". Heck, my brother had one of those one guns that just made a pop sound and when he pointed it at me, my dad took it away and stood him in a corner, lecturing both of us about how we shouldn't great a gun like a toy. Ever.
for some reason i ship illy and cavetown
Noooo not time out
Pew pew pew I love my new   Nerf gun
im going to be a teacher when i grown up just like you
Im dumb as a kid i eated sand i thought it was sugar :V
Uhhh I’m 10 and I pretend to kill mutants who take over humans and the whole earth is a wasteland and I have mutant powers bu isn’t evil and and lol
Sounds like Ms. Sheriff was an awesome boss. Right at the end when you told her what Karen did and she totally trusted in you was amazing.
I've been in time out for 12 years now.
i really loved this one :)
me watching: me seeing the All Might figure: :00
Bro this 4 year old that I babysit brings to my home a toy gun and plays with it all day  :0
E
Lets start with.. “Delaney  Me: Nervously giggles in holy hecc that’s my dead name-
OMG SHE USED MY NAME AND NOBODY USES IT FOR ANYTHING! NOT EVEN RANDOM GIFT SHOP STUFF!  Sorry had to freak out for a bit..
But... I love to play with my gun.... 🥺😳
Pew pew runs-
3:30 :0 HAWKS AND ALL MIGHT IS THAT YOU!!!???
To me, the disturbing thing wasn't that Bo played pretend guns -- it's that pretend guns was _all_ Bo wanted to play. Normal kids bounce from topic to topic like a squirrel on crack. Being super-focused on something like warfare or killing is a cry for help.  Plus, all kids should be taught firearm safety. Even if you abhor guns, it doesn't mean your precious pacifist child's friends' parents don't have them where a kid can find them.
Little guy took nerf of nothing a little too seriously-
I saw my hero academia and it was all might
Ha ha gun go brrr
once i heard about devin in this video i just know it is me he is a a lot like me
Pew pew 🔫
you're almost an adult lol
Merry Christmas, Illysa!
Me hears keren Also me: r/entitled parents
Bo likes guns  Me: this is American In my head though: we will watch your career with grate interest
Not blaming you specifically because you just worked there and didn't make the rulea but sending a kid to "time-out" when they do something like that seems like a really stupid solution to me, ngl it kinda feels like it's putting a band-aid on an inch deep cut with blunt scissors  At the very least you should try talking to the kid, I wouldn't suggest talking to the parents right away because that sorta situation sounds like problems at home but I do y know much about the law so that might be illegal idk
Damn Luigi has dem moves
my almost-29-year-old brain: I-I don't have to go to time out! because I don't play you-know-what! Honest!
wow I must say that I didn't expect it, beyond the story itself, I never thought about how other countries would react to those who play with guns and pretend to make war when they are play. I remember that every summer camp the animators organized a war with water guns xD
The entire company of nerf  ●_●
Literally i saw all the anime references in the background AND I LOVED IT
illymation: NO PRETEND GUNS FOR LITTLE KIDS >:( me who's been playing nerf guns with my brother since i was 7: oh no,  i m  i n  t r o u b l e
I have a 6 year old brother playing call of duty and I have been playing halo since I was like 5
R awkward finger guns that sixth grade boys do all the time allowed?
"almost an adult" needs to be on a mug...or something.
When I was a kid, I got suspended for playing cops and robbers. With 12 other kids. AND I WAS THE ONLY ONE! IMAGINE HOW CONFUSING THAT WAS TO A 6 YEAR OLD TOO!
Pretend play opens up a nice window into a child's psyche. There's a reason that's observed by therapists and psychiatrists to determine behavioral issues and so on. And it's a shame that parents like "Karen" have such a profound influence on their children's behavior. I hope the kid grows up and becomes better than his mom or, at the very least, his mom grows.
Why are 90% of these comments about Bo? It happened like, 4 years ago (I looked her age up and did the math it was 4 years ago). So just calm down, OK? Just, hold your horses. Worst case senario: Bo's parents got arrested but that's worst case. Also, don't reply to me saying, "UHuhuUuhuUHuUHU THIs wAS 4 YeaRS Ago aND tHats NoT A LoNg Time UuUUhuUHuUHuhuHuHhh."

Plays with guns 🔫 :)
*pew pew pew* *KRAKAKAKAKAKAKAKA* *BEEEEEOOooooo..BRAAAAAAAAH!*
Also grew up in the south. While I wasn't big on playing guns as a kid, my mom made it very clear to us that when our play involved guns (toy ones) we were to never EVER point a gun at anyone, human or animal. It didn't matter if we were pretending. I also remember one time my oldest brother went paint balling with a friend of his. They were doing this in our yard, at night. I remember my mom fussing at them to NOT point the paintball guns at one another, and then roughly 20 mins later they come back in because one of them got hit by the other's paintball and it hurt like the dickens. They got fussed at again and my child brain just thought "That's what you get for pointing your guns at each other!"
Oh my God the Animation is immaculate 😻
Umm..I used to play pretend with gun too and...well this is awkward
I have been commenting on this channel for days
Pew pew (Ima reble XD)
sometimes you nust forget how honest kids are
Can we talk about how all might is in the backround
Who the heck plays pretend guns? Is that what kids do nowadays? Now, that's what I call "America"... But seriously, who allows their kid to do stuff like that...?
luigi dancing gives me *l i f e*
What if the kid had an actual gun
Dude I am a delivery driver and I have gotten told by multiple people about how covid isn't real or because I look Mexican I shouldn't be delivering their shit. So I don't say anything but I am like why does what I look like matter and also really with the covid.

Koro Sensi is behind Illy on the self! Koro Sensi is the Squid mutant from  Assiantion Classroom!!
When I was a kid I loved grasshoppers. A lot. Like a lot a lot. According to my parents I used to kiss grasshoppers heads and send them off after "rescuing" them.   In kindergarten I used to play with only the lizard and grasshopper toy. One time a kid took that toy. And I sobbed and sobbed until I... Got put into timeout.
First you responded to that kid you are 18, but at the end of the video you said you are 19, I know it's not really important but I'm just confused
All i see is anime
Ah yes the anime references were everything
Does anyone saw nagisa from assasination classroom?
I dare for someone to name all the anime references in this video
Loved the video as usual
Yes! OMG long time childcare worker here. What is it about the guns and using blocks as guns?! We had a block in an afterschool program I worked at that was like a slide shape, like almost an L shape but curved underneath. Someone would ALWAYS call it a gun and play with it like one. I started hiding that block in my supply closet. I never had much problem with the kids but the PARENTS are the worst in a group setting. If one kids parents don’t like another kid around theirs, SORRY CAN’T HELP YOU. I have 30 children here. It was very stressful so I switched to working with families just one on one instead of in a group setting and it’s SO much better and you are SO much more appreciated.
But what about my finger guns?  *walks backwards finger gunning as he goes*
Delahni (I dont know how to spell) is on speed, not fun dip.
that kid that cares about pollution.. :'(  he's special.
All she had to say was “I think this one fits” and we already knew what was happening with Karen and Illy
Illy actually uploaded in 3 weeks? That's crazy
Can I play pretend knifes?

Can we talk about how that one girl was playing with Laddi and Shrek toys at 3:43?
Luigi dancing should be a meme
I love all the anime in the back
🔫🔫🔫
Love your many anime references! 😁
I remember  when  we were starting to get rid of pretend gun play at school back then I didnt see most parents throw fits like today. I feel like people are just starting to  learn rights as an adult and try to use it as an excuse for everything. Its great to learn your rights but remember freedom of speech only gets you so far as the rights to bear arms.
ik i did not just see sister krone
why does devin look like mac sticks
She would be called Karen
my mom has a day care at are house and some times theres seven kids at once and its chaos witch gets amplifyed buy my yellow cheeked conure fred being a fire alarm.
Good for her to chew you out liberal
I cant help but ask in the picture frame with you and another person is that the karasuno volleyball team jacket that your wearing?
I don't really see an issue with playing guns as long as the kid knows he can't play with the real thing and at least learns to participate in different forms of play so he begins to understand compromise. Also make sure he isn't taking on the "bad guy" role because he's been made to feel as if that is the role he has to play. Since kids sometimes determine what role someone can play as a form of social hierarchy. Also make sure it isn't metaphor for a bad home life. Granted I live in Australia where the chance of a child getting their hands on a legitimate firearm outside very very controlled conditions is basically nil. I guess it's different when dad keeps it in the bedside drawer.   As for Karen I think she knew that the other teacher was the one setting the rule, but she also knew that the other teacher would kick her butt if she tried that rant on her. You were young and new and juicy and she needed someone to sink her fangs into to feel better about herself.
Oh boi, the switch up was insane.
I liked and subscribe please dont send me to time out
The animation is diferent??
Why dont people ever think others talk to their coworkers or supervisors? If you treat one of us like garbage the others WILL hear about it
Pew pew

I can’t take care of kids cause I’m too easy for them to manipulate me into letting them do stuff lol
That was a terrible pun pun intended
It’s always leads back to the parents when a kid acts up that bad repeatedly and isn’t learning it’s not ok huh? Anyway great video; also love the fact you had the kids play with a toy Maz figure in the dollhouse it was awesome

Can I play pretend swords?
Pew Pew
Lmao i used to pretend to do some fucked up shit, when i was 10 i wanted to play "cannibals". My friends and i would kinda play zombie tag but when tou were tagged you had to lay down and let us "eat" you. Cps got involved and they threatened to take me away from my dad for letting me watch the walking dead. (zombie show where people kill and eat each other)
Uhh no no I no was not shooting my friend to death uh no no that was uhhh
Me: Here's the name Delaney in the video Also me: My name is apart of something that will go down in HISTORY. YES.
I can’t play pretend gun... When I have a pretend gun!
90% of childrens problems at that young age stem from home issues sadly
Great video it was hilarious 😂
Ily:kids are ok R/kidsarestupid: I beg to differ

*Proceeds to play guns*
Support the rainforest!
Illy: don’t play pretend guns or I’ll put u in time out Me and the boys with our nerf guns: war war never changes
I had a really horrible kindergarten year, all because of one teacher, who's name I don't even know.    For the sake of understanding any thing I'll call her Mrs. Smith. So, In Kindergarten I had my teacher, and the assistant teacher and my teacher was pregnant so most thing were done by the assistant teacher, Mrs. Smith. After the first month my real teacher left to give birth and took the rest of the year off, so we got a sub who was really sweet. But still Mrs. Smith did everything. Now, little kids do bad things because they are dumb and instead of asking why we did something or telling us not to, Mrs. Smith would just grab your arm and drag you to the principle's office. So I didn't learn better than to do bad stuff, but there are some things that I remember and even now that I know better they still don't make scene. I am going to point out three of these things. The first one that I'm still pissed about is that one day during lunch I rubbed my eyes, then the lunch lady says "don't make faces at me" I was really confused but just said okay. So, then I continued to rub my eyes and the lunch lady yells "DON'T MAKE FACES AT ME" I said sorry then ate my lunch. When lunch was over she told Mrs. Smith that I was making fun of her. Then Mrs. Smith goes to the office and checks the cameras and comes back and says why would you be so mean to her?!?! Then grabs my arm and takes me to the office, nobody be leaved me when I said I was just rubbing my eyes. As punishment I didn't get to eat lunch the next day, thinking back I should have told my parents. The second thing with Mrs. Smith is most likely the stupidest thing. So, they used to have "book time" in this time we would draw pictures and wright stories to go along with them. I wanted to make a comic so I drew a picture and a speech bubble, I wrote "NOOOO!!!" inside it, I forgot why, but I did. Mrs. Smith came over and yanked the piece of paper and yelled at me for writing only one word. She then took the paper to her desk, I was really upset because I had drawn a really pretty picture on the other side. At the end of the day I saw the paper crumbled up and in the trash can. Here's the last story: So, as I said Mrs. Smith would grab our arms. Well, one day I did something (I don't remember what) and Mrs. Smith grabbed my arm, But I hate it when people who are not my family touch me so I yanked my arm back, She thought I was trying to hurt her and called my mom and dad.
I love iumba on insta and I adore how she put Haikyu and anime references in the backgrounds! I hope to see more if that ever happens!
all these kids are now either popular or depressed
Do you watch demon slayer and my hero academia cuz i saw allmight- :c
I’m scared she made me throw away all my nerf fins away and I’m. 14
Can I just say that I do shooting as a hobby ( just paper targets don’t worry lol ) and before everyone slams guns and gun owners in the comments I just want to say that there is a way for younger audiences to participate in the hobby responsibly but you just have be VERY strict about the dos and donts of shooting and it’s safety precautions   And before there’s a ton of hate comments on this I just want to say that don’t disagree with the decisions in this video (even as a shooting enthusiast). The fact that the child was pretending to aim a gun at his classmates and shoot is DEFINITELY something that would need to be addressed ASAP. Pointing any gun at someone even unintentionally while moving and  unloaded is actually an instant permanent ban at my club.   ANYWAY,  I know I’m not the best writer but I basically wanted to say don’t judge all gun owners by this one situation (because the internet has a habit of doing this)
Littering is evil. Yes.
Illy: and I’ll call her...  everyone:Karen. Illy:Karen!
Me (being the mha lover I am) thinking Devin is alot like kirishima then seeing the kirishima stuffedy and...    *fangirling*
Why do none of these kids have hands? Does no one in her videos have hands and I'm just now noticing? I'm so confused!
3:43 look At the boys toy 👀
I love how anime references were added XD I saw you all P.S. I was most connected to the Assassination Classroom things lol. We cry for Koro Sensei

:gun: you can't stop me
anyone else notice the slight art style change? its very slight, but i'm loving it. everything Illy draws is amazing.
There were so many anime references and at 4:23 when I saw the board behind Mrs.Sheif woth young Touya and Keigo and then another picture of young Bakugou and Midoriya that made me so happy for some reason. Thank you Illy for the free serotonin.
YOU CAN’T TELL ME WHAT TO DO
I’m so exited for the demon slayer movie
My older brother actually got a toy gun or like an airsoft gun when he was a kid and when they traveled the guards asked my mother if it was real, ofc it wasn't and then they rly interviewed my mother and brother thankfully there were one of those guards or like police that said that that's absolutely just a toy...but I do understand it bc it's for safety smthin and it's pretty weird tho that a kid will be bringing a toy gun 😂
Oof poor chip n dale
HAPPY HOLIDAYS
KORO SENSEI AHHH
Okay i'm in love (platonically) with Devon

That kid Devin is one passionate kid. I gotta say, he’s smarter at that age then most people I know-
I LOVE ALL THE ANIME REFERENCES
I love yellow lover
I like how you can tell what shows or games she's into rn by looking at the designs for backgrounds and background characters
please don't send me to time out. I have a family, PLEASE
“What’s wrong with guns?”  Americans be like
I hope our after school teachers thought we were as amazing as you talk about these kids cause like we were terrible, our friend group broke up every other day, there was a lot of crying involved.
merry christmas illy i hope you have a wonderful holiday
I play guns
I was that Bo kid in 1st grade, but instead of a gun, I built a lego shaped sword. The kid I played with told the teacher on me and I got scolded for playing pretend with weapons of any kind. I didn't know playing pretend weapons were not allowed in school. And that's the last time I played with that kid. We were playing power rangers for crying out loud LOL At least I didn't get time out from my teacher though. She's nice :)
I absolutely love all these anime references and definitely the toya one with hawks I loved that one
Well she didn't say anything about real guns soooooo
Pew pew
*pew pew pew*
R2D2-47, one of the most deadly star wars characters ever created 😲
You cant just threaten time outs, that just 'backs me up in a corner'... It was funny shut up
Me: you can't take away my finger guns! Pew pew pew pew!! Boss Fight music starts Mrs Sheriff appears Me: cheese it, it's the fuzz  ... I fought tooth and nail, high tailed it as far as I could go, almost thought I could make it out. but when I hit the invisible wall, I realized this was the end... A scripted insta-kill
okay I have a story hold on.  I have 5 little cousins that could beat me up at the age of 13 and they were like 7 or 8 so I really hate kids so when I went to a ""daycare because I was still too young to be alone at home at night I was picked on by kids and I built a  Fort Out of a really big blocks like these blocks were bigger than me and I am still 5' tall at 18 so I'm when the teacher like went behind the counter and other kids would come in I would push the blocks on top of the kids and buried Them alive basically and the kids would cry in scream and because these were plastic blocks that fell on someone's head. it hurt when you got hit with these.  I never got in trouble but no one messed with me after that OK bye (ps I was like 12
Welp. I’m going to Timeout. See y’all.
Lets be honest Illy would be an amazing teacher
Did anyone also think that once the background music started it sounded very similar to the intro song of a infamous website? I was shocked at first thinking she put that intro song lmao. Love the video!
I’m not gonna lie I used to be like Bo XD
Why use a pretend gun when u can use a homemade gun but seriously my dad let me play a homemade gun(almost close to a bazooka i think)
can ms. karen be put in timeout?
“Why? What’s wrong with guns?” Me: world war 3 has started.
4:19 AHHH TOUYA AND BBY HAWKS OH MY LORD. THAT SENT ME. also merry Christmas
🍭🍬
koro sensei on da calendar 😎
Karen made me so angry! How can people be so two faced
A reason why the kid shouldn't behave like that is because if the behavior keeps up with it, it will stay within him and turnout for the worst in the future.
As someone who also started outside school hours care at 19 I relate so hard to the "you're almost an adult".
i love how canary and gon are there in the beginning AND the hawks plushie and the kiri plushie  and the volleyballs lol i honestly had no idea you watched anime before hieurjoritjhfe
Illy: *tells an interesting story*  Me: Her cat do be vibing tho

I need to confess. I LOVED PLAYING PRETEND GUNS AS A KID
In 0:06 i I found two Hunter x Hunter reference and the Soul Eater One
Illy: image coming to work everyday and having people come and hug you and cheer you Me:...Can i have that?
That "lady" is the type of person to roast the kid when they reach for the light while she is driving...             I hope the kid learns gun edicate like always treat a gun as if it is loaded, don't point the gun at people at all cost, keep finger off the trigger unless ready and prepared to, etc.
I remember In my 8th grade year I had to help some 1st graders because I was failing my classes That year and they had a special program to help elementary kids so I had to help them with there homework and Help them learn and hang out with them  so watching this video really gave me so much happy memories from that year thank you so much for making my day better❤️
5:17 LMAO. I knew it!
XD There was this boy in my class (like in 4th grade or idk really long ago) that was playing gun and my lil old angry self just got up and hit him and he never played gun again and we became bff.  Little kid logic makes no sense lol
Pew pew
Did anyone else think this kid was playing “fireman” when Illy said “water guns?”
You should make a video abt anime

As somebody named Bo, every time I hear my name in this video I get a mini heart attack and get sent to time out for playing pretend guns!
What about "Pretend Sword"? :3
I very much want a sequel, and then a sequel to that sequel.
So many my hero academia references I wonder if she likes my hero academia this is the second episode where she’s put my hero academia characters in it

Yay a new video
Hey ill! I used to worked for a daycare center for 6 years and delt with "those" type of parents. There was a child that was doing the same thing.  We had warn the parents and they said it's harmless fun. Girl! This kid told me he was going to bring his father's gun and shot me because I told him "no". And because of his odd behavior, he stabbed his older brother with a pair of scissors and his brother had to be admitted to the hospital for lost of blood.  Love working with children but these parents need stop thinking that their child is an angel.
Where I’m from kids often play pretend guns, and gun fights, but people are not just allowed to own guns, you have to have a license, And compared to what kind of license you have you can only have specific guns, oh yeah and guns not allowed in public places, if you wanna bring your gun out do you have to go to a restricted area, like a forest where are hunting is allowed.
Happy holidays everyone! This is how many people are glad 2020 is almost over! 😁🤗 👇👇💕
Holy Sh*t a mother that always talks gun are good
Aye You’ve seen soul eater cool
Time out is the version of Brazil to the kids

Global warming is no myth, and I swear to God it'll take faces melting off their skin for some people to see it
Is there any jojo references
Reminds me of the time when I was 17 working at a summer camp as a life guard . The place has two pools that’s important for later .I live in a place that happens to have very bad weather aka thunder storms often in the summer . One day a kid decided to go to the bathroom in the pool . So we had to clear the pool . Someone who was there with there kid at the time was a little mad from the look on her face but she didn’t say anything . So everyone had to go the other pool which I would say had about 60 something kids in it . Then I saw lighting right outside the pool fence . So I had to close the pool for weather . So I told everyone that they had to leave the pool deck . Keep in mind I was on the lifeguard stand still has people were still leaving the pool. The girl from earlier starts to scream at me for closing the pool and she had a right to be in it . When lighting was right outside the pool area . My coworker had to get my boss who had to get his boss . Then they came out and we had to spend 20 minutes of her cursing and screaming at me and my boss . Till she finally left it was the first time I meet a Karen .

Illy : Because ITS A CHILD.                                                                                                                                                      *Devin : Getting ready to call the SWAT*
What if I shoot my friends with a  nerf gun? Will I still be in Time out I need to know??
Ha, almost an adult
Please don’t send me to time out!
1:36 Delaney is so adorable
The queen is back ❤️
yesss anime easter eggs
I wish all adults could be like those kids except for boe
Omg this reminds me of something I saw on a group I'm in recently... someone asked how old her child should be before she allowed them to learn how to use a gun. There were MANY people in the comments saying 4 years old and look... I'm from the south, I'm OK with having a gun for protection and hunting, but I'm not OK with a 4-year-old having a gun or being anywhere near one. It bothers me. Such a young kid doesn't understand the responsibility of a gun. But I guess I'm just a stupid liberal or whatever they call people like me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3:51 anaknya aktif ya bund
My name is bo and I have the same haircut :0
You aren't as strict as my elementary school.   When I was in first grade, I made a pointing motion to tell a kid to stop picking on me that kinda looked like a finger gun and I got sent to the principles office.  They did not mess around!
🔫 >:)
Dude I’m just sitting here like I’ve seen Koror-sensei like 5 times and I had to do a double take when I saw Nagisa so yo needles to say watch Assassination Classroom.
I’m not so early =>
dang I wish I grew up with MHA plushies on every shelf even though I know Momo's... 'luggage' is the opposite of kid friendly
All the anime references 🥰
I noiced in the back round that there is naruto hawks and i think all might
*makes a sword*
Delaney is like hinata. But a lemon instead of a tangerine
Omg, send my love to your background artist, she made my day.
pew pew
Lovess your viedo
I went to an after school, and we had to call the teachers auntie. It was weird...
1:08 Is this a double reference to both Chip n' Dale and also the fact that you dress like Simon from Alvin and the Chipmunks?
The dolls the kids were playing with are animators 👀 I also noticed lots of anime references
I had a feeling there was going to be a Karen in this xD
the funny thing is that Karen thought you guys would not talk about her out burst. like, dude, have you ever worked with someone anyone that is not you? :D coworker stalk to each other about crap like that :DD
That almight plushie reminds me of dekus bedroom (And there’s a hawk plushie but that’s not like deku but he does know a lot about hero’s so I don’t know)
the way luigi just dances is perfection
Soon as I saw that hair cut *slaps hands* shit is going to go down hill.
I like bo he sounds nice :)
In the background was that her and kendo I think his name is from haiku as a girl or not Idk I’m probably wrong
GHEDGHCXHJ the korisensei in the background is :)  edit: actually all the assassination classroom references
I think illy taking the "tell me you love anime, without telling you love anime" challenge to far
Am a big boy I well play with gun's you can't do noting
"I'll call her...Karen!"  Me: Ah sh*t, here we go again.
As someone who helped with kindergarteners for about a semester in my high school year, I will say, they can have a lot more personality than you think for just 5 year olds. Like this one little girl (I'll just call her Lily), who apparently had an older teenage sister, had some SPUNK to her. Like one day during lunch I told them: "Okay guys I'm gonna go get myself lunch, but I'll be back to eat with you" And Lily pointed at me like: "Okay but you BETTER be back before the end of lunch or I'm gonna be MAD at you!" And I was just so taken aback by that. But another interesting thing is that- kids are??? Really nice??? Like they're often portrayed as screaming, loud, messy, temper-tantrum having brats, but they're really generous and help each other and usually try their best and get excited over learning sometimes. Are there some kids who struggle a bit more? Yes. Are there accidents or times they didn't know better or got too excited? Yes. But they're surprisingly sweet. And last thing- can confirm they would run over and hug you or want to hold your hand everyday.
Pew pew
Hey don't sue the fossil fuels industry because without it the economy of my home state of Wyoming relies on w things fossil fuels and rodeo
3:14 THERES A HAWKS DOLL ON THE SHELF OMG YAZZZZZZZ I LOVE HIMMM!!!! He is my husband    Edit: I have noticed all the reference not just him lol
. . . **SLOWLY PULLS OUT PRETEND GUN**
Flamingos child hood: I LiKe GuNs
0:30 its a abnormal chaos plushie
Ilyssa:Don't play pretend guns or I will send you to time out! Me, who has accidentally broken more toy guns than I can count: ._. ok
“Why? What’s wrong with guns?”  Lmafo I- 👁👄👁
I swear some kids are more mature than adults that's why I'm going to talk to my kid like a person and not like a child
Illy saying she can’t be anything but a chipmunk 🐿 Me:You could be Merida from brave. Edit : I’m just imagining the kids in the class being like shut the f up
.+*Plays pretend guns*+.
this global warming kid is my favourite human being on this earth 100/10 faith in humanity restored for a couple seconds
I’m the fun dip girl lol
7:24 is that a threat!! Ooohhh i will play pretend guns just watch me
I love the all might plush
I shoot guns
I needed this!
👀👀🌚🌚..... ok y’all she’s not looking  *plays pretends guns*
This reminded me a lot of conversations I've had with my therapist.  She works a bit with adolescents and teens, and she's made her own unofficial "DSM" for some of the issues she sees in the kids she treats, because 9 times out of 10 those issues are that their parents are crap.  Things like "VPM" for "Vicarious Pageant Mom," "DSD" for "Daughter-Shaming Dad," "EPE" for "Expected Parenting to be Easy," to name a few.  She actually used to work with kids as young as you describe, but she had to stop because she couldn't handle dealing with their parents.  It broke her heart to know what a kid needed to be happy but have the parents take no time or effort to do their part, and it was affecting her quality of care so she moved to working with adults and teens.  It's really sad.
Illy: don’t play pretend guns Quiet kid: don’t worry, this isn’t pretend
What is the worst thing in the world... Herricks
Illy: let’s call her Karen  Me: KAREN ALERT BATTLE STATIONS PEOPLE
This video is freaking hilarious. Little kids are hilarious! You’ll never know what they’ll do next! I work at a daycare, and this video is very relatable. 2 weeks ago, a kid I was watching said to me, “I dare you to run a mile in your underwear.” I respond by saying, “No, I will get arrested..” 😂😂😂 Happy Holidays everyone!
Merry Christmas Illy
But pretend guns is so much fun :(
The nen 101
Bang Bang🔫
Merry Christmas Illy!
Almost an adult, in canada 18 is an adult

Omg I love the hidden Anime things 😆😌✌️😃 This was a good video! ✌️😆😎😃 Merry Christmas Eve and Merry Christmas to everyone!  ⛄🦌🤶🎅
I can't be the only one who cant get over the fact that she puts millions of anime easter eggs in her videos!
Replace of the  5 with a 12
Is there any more stories of you working at school? Cause it seems very funny and intresting! Please do a part two! 😊

Livin in the geto rat tatatat
Hi illy my birthday was 4 days ago
Did anyone spot the Midoriya and Bakugo picture in Ms Sheriffs room
Oof ilyssa got called out
3:04 not according to the offspring
“Oh, so you’re almost an adult” is the worst insult ever
I see you lily with these anime references, I see you 😏
There’s a stuffed toy of all might
Devon looks like me
The teacher has a picture of bakugo and deku
The irony of assassination classroom calendar 🤣
One of the funniest animations I have watched in a long time. I don’t know why!
Girl I play with real pew pews
the girl from hunterxhunter rly do be there tho starting with the anime references off the bat  so im in
I love the anime references!
lmao I never thought that playing guns was bad until you said that..  it's such a normal thing nowadays
DOES ANYONE SEE THE ANIME CHILDREN'
0:06 is that naruto, h x h, soul eater, my hero academia, and jujutsu kaisen? i think i got these all right (i’m not sure if pokémon is classified as an anime. also, i think haikyuu is there.)
HOLY CRAP IS THAT A HAWKS PLUSHIE AND A NARUTO PLUSHIE 0:50 AND ALL MIGHT?!
Sorry miss but it's nerf or nothin
I saw that hawks plushie..
6:06 Me: *cough* columbine *cough*
I saw the haircut with Karen and I already know what was about to happened.
I seen an Allmight plushy in the bake ground
🔫 you can't stop me!
Next vid, these kids found my YouTube channel
This video is such a culture shock to me because where I'm from (the Balkans) "playing war" is a common childrens game almost as popular as hide and seek
Boe be like: *Meet the Spy*
*So Guns = time-out*
An R2D2 47 lol
So I use guns like every day. So I’m I going to timeout
I found naruto and all might
On the supervisors computer you can see a picture of Deku and Bakugo as kids that is adorable I love my hero academia
When I was 9 my friend made me an origami of a gun and I thought it was really nice. Since I was an exchange student at the time I didn't really know it was such a bad behaviour so I just casually walked around the school with it and got us both in trouble
i have been an after school care teacher for 3 years and i love this job i work with 3-5 year olds and it is an interesting job to say the least
Devon suspiciously looks like me...
Hmm, you know... Pretending to "play with guns" is ok actually. They're just kids. BUT at the same time, that kid could have an affection towards guns... That won't end up pretty good. AND like Illy said, ONLY pretending to "play with guns" is pretty suspicous.        Oh, and there's Karen
My nephew is just like him he’s very violent and my sister gets really upset if anyone gets mad at him for it 😅 and he’s only 5…
5:06 all might is in the background!!!!
i was a childcare worker for three and a half years and you very perfectly encapsulated what it’s like lmao, especially the emphasis on looking at the “problem child’s” point of view. that is in quotations bcs that’s a term we have to stop using as it creates an internal bias without even meeting the kid. the situation at home has such a big effect on kids, there’s only so much that can be done outside of it but that’s where school/after school staff can really help create a stable and predictable environment that kids can latch onto. so much patience is needed with jobs like this, which is why my heart goes out to everybody in the school system affected by this year, so many are still able to find it and it’s amazing to see. thank somebody you know who works in the school system y’all
I have been working at an aftercare program for over 8 years and I love telling all the stories that kids do or say at program!  Honestly, my favorite job I have ever worked because it's so rewarding when the kids come up to you and tell you how much they love you or that they want to be like you when they grow up!
0:15 how to start on hateing on kids in 7 seconds
Ok I will use real guns instead
All the anime references? I can appreciate
God I love ms.sherrif
The amount of anime references in the backgrounds always makes me overwhelmingly happy
1:17 leaf village and I believe assume ems
What if I don’t pretend to play guns? Also why is the kid not waking up?
Time out D:
Wait I see MORE (MHA people)
what does that say for finger guns??,,
Do I see someone from MHA ( I don’t know how to spell the little bird guys name)
Hahaha YOU WILL NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE
He played you like a fiddle heh i got that reference
5:25 on the calendar you can see koro Sensei from assassination classroom my favorite anime so I was really happy when I saw this and that illy appreciates koro Sensei that’s awesome I love that little Easter egg
I really enjoyed all of the anime references. My favorite was Nagisa at Disney Land.
i love shooting guns, i think its a nice fun activity to try to see who got the best score, but this lady was fuckin wacko
Miss sherif seems like the best
I am 37 and way more adult than you Mrs illymation and if you send to timeout i will hold my breath until i die and you will go to prison forever. *storms off to play pretend guns*
Now I'm tempted to try and fail at drawing and voicing my own adventures in being a yard duty for 10 years. I kept notes. The notes were partly so I could get info before filling out any paperwork - those things were in triplicate and I only had so many so best to not need to rewrite them. Also my memory has always been poor so writing stuff down helped a lot with me being a different schools with different schedules and rules at a moment's notice. Stopped that job due to my too much stress on my then undiagnosed autistic brain and said brain blue screening horribly one of the last days I worked.
i freaked when i saw korosensei
Merry Christmas everyone! Or happy holidays ! ☃️🎄😊
i always pretend as an ice wizard now im a meth head
WhO tOoK MY CrAyOn
ok no gun play.  but what about earthquake.
*Kids are real savages nowadays! 😂*
Man u a snich! You just lost your top 4 spot of people I would want for a heist
Loved it ! My mom used to work at one of those places as a teacher's "helper"ish and those kid were so sweet aswell
what if.. i play guns.. at a shooting range? with my older brother? with protective things? haha no timeout for me
Luigi do be moving doe
1:10 HMM EXCUSE ME, ILLYSA....   DALE’S NOSE IS BLACK NOT RED SMH👮
Aww i saw koro sensei from assassination classroom        Spoiler: PLS DONT READ IF YOURE STILL WATCHING IT AND HAVEN'T FINISHED IT      His death made me cry 😭😭😭😭😭😭
i have a death note that i bring to school and my friends r scared i might write their name on it. yall got any tips on making them less scared?  Edit: ive told them it doesnt actually kill them but they r scared anyway
7:25 how dare u >:(
Cool! grade school replacement might not be so bad afterall but I'm keeping my highschool job
* sniff * * sniff * Do I smell a slight art style change?
*plays pretend guns* HAHA >:D
KORO SENSEI IN THE BACKGROUND!
3.000th comment aha
Drinking game: go through this video and if you see an anime reference you take a shot
Heyo, gun guy here, if your kids do nothing but pretend to shoot their friends you’re really missing the urinal with your stream
Never Ever Rally your friends to Fricking shoot each other
At the end: Me:But illy your not my mum and you have no idea where I live  illymations: *finds out where I live* Me: sh#!
* me babysitting a toddler while her parents were out *  her: .... me: so what do you want to do? her: idk we could watch frozen me:                                     *imploding inside*
Will that third part ever come out? Or was the filmed one it?
No you will not take my nerf gun away
"Why? What's wrong with guns?" "Ma'am, this is a Wendy's."
Not me looking in the background at all the anime references
Cool
My names "Alyssa" as well so it was funny to me every time the children said Alyssa😂😂😂
Hey I have a block = gun put my in  time out
7:24   Me: points finger guns at Illy
omg this is cute video
Damn I feel bad for Bo
Merry Christmas.
00:12 kinda reminds me of a story a friend of mine told me from when she volunteered at her church’s children’s play group (right after our confirmation): Little girl: “How old are you?” My friend: “Fourteen.” L.G.: “… Do you have a husband yet?” Friend: 😬😰
Luigi's dancing killed me-
I still processing that Devon a 6 year old kid has a genuine concern for Global Warming, and sincerity hope he’s making a great impact on the world and the environment.
Me: *chilling and watching this thinking my name won’t show up* Illy: so we will call her... Delaney! Me, who’s last name is Delaney: IM SORRY *WHAT*?!
Thank for the videos!!!!
No one:  The All Might plushie in the background: I AM HERE ON A SHELF
I was so happy whenever I saw all the anime references. ESPECIALLY HAIKYUU AND MY HERO ACADEMIA
4:39 LOOK AT KACCHAN AND DEKU :3 0:06 A Naruto character Gon, and someone else. Noice
I love all the MHA stuff hidden in your videos!
What's wrong with Guns....instead of "what's wrong with killing your friends"
For some reason this video felt like a more OG video than the last few
I’ve got a gun! 🔫
What if I use airsoft?
Miss.sherrif sounds like a pretty cool lady 😎
OMFL THE REFERENCES WITH ASSASSINATION CLASSROOM IS GIVING ME SO MUCH NOSTALGIA I LOVE IT SO MUCH. I MISS NAGISA AND KORO SENSEI.
We need to protect these kids at all its cost, I don't care if we loose boomers or Karens cause of it
Did yall see the koro sensei calendar
Misalisa is what i keep hearing
Who here also wants more stories of ms. Sheriff?
My mom is a child care worker and she had. A time when she was playing guns not like bow like shooting bad guys (not friends more like zombies) but the other teachers said gun are bad and the 2-3 year old just looks up at my mom and said " my dad has lots of guns....is my dad bad" she told him no ( guns are ok in my town deer hunting is in our culture)
And the lesson today is to never use finger guns around Ilyssa or you go to big kid time out
You used my name Delaney in a video and I feel honored 🥺❤️
Me, someone who plays the Cyberpunk TTRPG: does this mean I have to go on time out now? o~o"
Ok you now what the second amendment is  You are allowed to amass weapons to overthrow the government.
misalisa
the amount of anime character in the background tho-
I spy a Deku cameo
I just wanted to say, Merry Christmas to everybody and if you don’t celebrate Christmas than I hope you have a wonderful day/night!! If you’re reading this, you are important to at least one person!!!! 🎄🎄🎄🎄🎄
"What is the most evil thing in the world?"  and he says: "trump lol"
3:41 theamaaazing as a toy, 3:52 and jaiden animation as a toy
I love your thumb nails!
4:20 look, it the mha kids  But honestly I feel really bad for Bo, he must have encountered that behavior from home because WHERE ELSE WOULD HE LEARN IT. Its sad to see him with that kind of parent who thinks it’s okay to have their 6 YEAR OLD CHILD play “guns”
WOW new video AND also near chrismas
@illymation 🔫 what are you gonna do bout it?
All of the anime Easter eggs :0 you are my favorite animator now 🧑‍🦲🏃‍♀️
Unless you live in Detroit, you don't need  gun
7:24 🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫🔫
what a nerd imagine b eing a teaching lol nerd lol
As someone who was a volunteer TA at an elementary school for a few years, I can confirm working with kids is a trip!
Karen was just another child with really long legs XD
Illy: Don't play pretend guns 🔫 or I will send you to timeout!  Me: Really?? Hmmm *Looks at water gun*  Me: *Plays Pretend Guns* !  Nah,I'm just kidding!
Thank you for this Christmas video! Loved the ending. Please no time out 9 have nerf guns so technically they are not pretend
i just love how they add anime references 💀
6:04 Oh my FREAKING God.
1:09 its nagisa and koro sensei    Sorry if spelt there names wrong
"and do t play pretend guns" some dude with a real gun shooting his phone
By second grade i had already bit 27 PEOPLE oh and i gave them all scars! They all attacked me at recess, THE TEACHERS WERE WATCHING ME BE OBLITERATED!! And i was screaming their name but they just stared at me. I couldn't get up, everytime i did, i was beat to the ground. So i grabbed onto a metal bar on the monkey bars, opened my mouth, and swung my head back and forth. They all ran away... AND TOLD ON ME!!!!!!!! I WAS PUNISHED!!!!! lhsvsuzbahgzihl
I love the Karen's textbook two-face suckup behavior.  It was almost like she knew she could get away with taking out her inner response to what she assumed was a "guns are bad and so are the people who use them" attitude.  I think the kid was probably in need of some responsible gun training (don't aim at anything you don't intend to kill) and some attention that feeds his need to be the center of attention and power in the play situations with his peers. He probably feels quite powerless at home with the horrible mom.
Easy, the answer is that he becomes Jack O'Neil son and does what happens to him before Stargate SG1 even starts. That or he does it to his parents or some else. That is why I don't think kids should be playing with guns, they don't have the mental capacity yet to distinguish between the two, and I would very much like that they do get to that age.
Illy u need to take a break u have uploaded 3 or 4 vids in like 3 months relax we can wait
I'M GOING TO PLAY PRETEND GUNS AND NOBODY CAN STOP ME!!!!
Every time you upload a new video, I get so amazingly happy. The fact that you did a new video on Christmas Eve when I really needed some cheer just made me ecstatic. Thank you so much. 😊
I used to be kind and caring like Devon. Now I'm a teenager
A year ago when I was 18 i went to summer camp on three separate occasions to help with high school credits. I volunteered as a cabin leader for a group of girls each time, and that was the most fun thing ever. None of them were huge problems at all, though I did favor my second group. I really want to become a naturalist, but I don't think they'll be open anytime soon because of the pandemic and all.
I really like your backroung.
4:59 koro sensi how fitting also naruto and other anime characters
Is it a bit concerning that I was 3 and playing games with kindergartners that played some Star Wars game but including guns and death?-
Me at the beginning: Nuuu! 🤣  Me about a minute in: Awww!!!  Me 2 minutes in: Aww nooo this poor little dude TvT
I think illy is a weeb
Me: *sees Korosensei in the background* Also Me: *sobs*
It’s the tiny hawks in the cubby for me
So glad you had fun with your childcare experience! I was not as fortunate as you lol - a child bit me on my first day and I cried 😂 Needless to say, childcare is not for me!
You not my mommy
Let's be real, we all knew what Bo's mother's name was gonna be.
I want to be a teacher
NOT TIME OUT!!!!!!!
Anime references-  Illy: yEs
Anime references!!!!!!!
I feel so bad for my preschool teacher. When I was 3 my brother accidentally knocked out my 2 front teeth. So they were hanging out of my mouth and it really hurt. Then my dad SENT ME TO PRESCHOOL and didn’t even notice. So they had to call my mom to pick me up and thought I was abused. I still don’t know why he did that.
This is such a good topic yet we only got like 2 stories, imma NEED a part 2 lol
Ok I’m back with anime references so if I missed any please tell me in the replies   HunterxHunter: 0:06 0:30 (Canary and Gon is the background)(there is book that says “Nen 101” with Hisoka’s classic tear and star mark on it)   Jujitsu Kaisen: 0:06 (Itadori is in the background)  Soul Eater: 0:06 (Soul is in the background)   Pokémon: 0:06 (Pokémon walls)   My Hero Academia: 0:06 0:30 4:20 4:38 (All Might plushie) (Hawks plushie) (there is a feather in the ground that matches Hawks feather)?

Devon is my FAVORITE oh my god 😂😂
Yay! Reping assassination classroom with nagisa and koro sensei
**Plays Pretend Guns**  Illy; Ima 'bout to end this man's whole career
i like yellow too
In my old pre school we played cops and robbers and the robbers killed the cops we never got in trouble
I only now realised what K-12 means..  Comment if u know what I mean :’)
Wear a mask or I WILL send you to time out! With Mrs. Sherif.
I love the Hunter X Hunter reference at the beginning
Merry Christmas illy 🎅🤶🦌
4:39 Is no one gonna talk about the photos of Mirko, Bakugou, Deku, and Hawks and Touya?
I'm a full-time teacher for a twos and threes classroom and I SO relate to these! SO MANY of the kids at my center like to play guns. They build them out of legos and chase each other around the room. I have come back from my lunch break or even from going to the restroom and they're doing it. And then I walk in and the kids take one look at me and dismantle their "guns." Also, yes, they do cheer and run over for hugs when I come in and it's ADORABLE.
Epic
Bless all of those kids! Oh my god Devon 😂 the world needs more kids furious about pollution
1:09  *Assassination Classroom Fan?* You have earned my respect.
Has anyone noticed that there was many anime easter eggs?
Is that-  IS THAT ALL MIGHT MERCH
I just love the background and references
I have a reason why playing guns is bad BECAUSE THE CHILD MAY GROW UP TO USE REAL GUNS IN ILLEGAL WAYS (I've used a gun myself and I'm not a Adult and you may say that's bad but we were in a area far away from any houses just doing target practice and it had a silencer so it wouldnt scare any nearby animals)
4:14 he go pew pew pew
“Cuz boy does she run a strict town!”
Illy: DON'T PLAY WITH GUNS OR I'LL SEND YOU TOO TIME OUT! Me: Whoa calm down, don't pull out the 9
WOW IM ACTUALLY EARLY
I'm 32 and I still feel like I'm a l m o s t an adult...
I'M NOT GOING BACK IN TIME OUT*runs in wall*
MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM AUSTRALIA!!! LOVE YOU ILLY HAVE A WONDERFUL HOLIDAYS!
Luigi tho-
Kids can be weirdly obsessed with blood and gore. I was an instructor for a summer day camp and I had a 7 year old draw a vey gory picture inspired by 5 Nights at Freddie's.  Also once when we were making structures out of popsicle sticks, one of the 5th graders created a diorama of the camp from Friday the 13th complete with blood stains while me and the other counselor were distracted helping the other kids.
Do... do finger guns count?
KEJRFOIEWN THE HAIKYUU TRAINING PACKS EIN
This was so sweet. Due to covid I can't work at my daycare any more and I miss the children SO much. Coming in every day having excited children cheering your name just warms your heart.
We all have a boe in our class no matter what grade and where you are
Jokes on you I’m already in timeout
I used to play pretend army with guns *toys* but not play pretend MURDER
Oooh I spotted a lot of MHA easter eggs 😍
All might
That kid's going to grow up to shoot guns and I like it that way that was a joke BTW
I want a classroom like that  OMG
Illy and that Karen's conversation is like mine and my sister's conversations. Ridiculous and illogical.
Hi
I saw Nagisa :)
THE ONLY CONSISTENT ANIMATOR LEFT
I SAW THAT ABNORMAL CHAOS PLUSH AT THE START.
Hope you have an amazing Holiday! Love the video!
1:09 KORO-SENSEI
I've met a kid like bo I was so annoyed by it (I took care a little kids before corona)
The animation has gotten so much better illy has improved so much
As a 2nd amendment lover, that's not ok. Kids shouldn't want to shoot their friend, and Karens shouldn't have a firearm of any sort. Kids (of a certain age which can depend on the area you live in) should be taught about how one can be safely used, AND NOT TO POINT IT AT SOMEONE UNLESS IT'S IN A LIFE OR DEATH SITUATION. Especially for someone his age who likely doesn't understand the concept of death. Because this is how you can get an idiot with a weapon and lack of empathy, and since the mom is already confusing the child he's going to have a difficult time learning right from wrong.
1:21 Luigi do be vibin tho
in morocco i likef guns as uh a 4 yaer old and i have alot of toy guns so for 6 yaer old it wase kind late bc at age 5 i laernd how to play gta3
I’m gon play pretend gun stealer
Me with my nerf war be like 0-0
I grew up near columbine in the early 2000s  That shit would have gotten me expelled
You're already an adult, Stop the cap once you are past 18 you're an adult
i’m coming to get this kids 🔫
Excuse me Ilyssa, finger guns are my second amendment right 👈👈
This miss Sheriff sounds like a real MVP 👌
What about finger guns?
"NO!" "YEAH!" "NO!" "YEAH!" 👌
So we not gonna talk how gon ryu evans and naruto were in the back?
I legit don’t know what’s wrong with pretend guns I played first person shooter games when I was six and even played with cardboard guns
Why is no one talking about Luigi's dance at 1:22?   It's beautiful
When I saw the gun kids parent I was like it’s the KAREN cut
Everbody doing what they doing                        Me: See likes anime 🥺 yay
Ok i will not play guns
noob
Merry Christmas, Ilyssa!
Oh goodness, last time I watched your videos I broke my phone
I saw a Kirishima in the background! and a hawks and everyone I've ever loved from My Hero Academia!!!
4:57 ANIME
I play real guns but they man at the bank doesn't seem to like it to much and he called his sheriff and I got sent to Tim out for 4-6 years >:(
haha u cant time out me im in texas and u not haha
The CAT DANCING IS FLOORING ME
happi chrimus
Luigi Dance. Make that a shirt.
When I literally heard my name as a fake name for one of the kids I freaked out
Nice
3:42 IS THAT SHREK
i'm only 0:39 seconds in but i just started crying because of course she added a koro-sensei reference
I litteraly just noticed when the teacher said [o he knows better] I SAW MHA
So no one’s gonna talk about that very nice anime drawings in the background
Pew pew  I'm playing pretend guns
Illy: let’s call her... K- Me: oh no...
i love your videos so much!! your voice is so calming and pretty (that’s probably weird to say lol) 😂♥️
6:09 because that behavior can be also used when they grow up yeah idiot
And people thought I was a weird kid for writing and performing plays on the playground. This kid was playing with boxes as if they were guns. 😬
A gun carrying household should be more concerned about that. I mean, you wouldn't want your kid getting hurt cause they thought a gun was a toy.
I think when you turn 18 you are an Adult
ur cute and i love ur vids
Wow, i'm the same age and I'm still at school even though I want to work...  I feel old and childish at the same time xD
that kid really called her out 😂😂
Good for that little kid(the one mad about pollution)
Ah yes the anime Easter eggs
what is its not pertend
Honestly, I’m a Texan and let me tell you, I don’t pretend to shoot guns, I do shoot guns.
This vidoe is now a personal favorite for me now ❤❤❤
A certain type of Learning block was banned at my school because at afterschool and free time People would always make and play pretend Guns
Also, lucky you. You got to enjoy teaching. You surely were a great teacher. My teachers in my juniorhigh mostly hated teaching so there was a lot of conflict between the students and teachers and it was just hell in the classroom.
At 0:35 - is that a food wars plushie- and KOROSENSEI? 😩💅🏻
I DIED AT R2D2 DHBWFJENKDNREKDKRN
You can't tell me what to do *Pew* *Pew*
Our Christmas gift was a new illy video. Happi Christmas
The way you drew Karen lol. Nice one
those backgrounds look great.
I don’t really think of it as global warming, it’s just climate change in my opinion since a lot of places get colder now rather than hotter. Nice kids you got to teach though.
I work at a daycare and I will say it's kinda like this but it's very annoying
The photographer is korosensei
Plays pretend guns in comments
Kid: *plays guns after illy founds out the rules*  Illy: It was a short-lived victory for you
all the anime references are amazing
3:41 thats laddi btw in her hand
It's funny how he wanted to kill dinosaurs and rob people and not... I don't know, fight alien spaceships, shoot zombies, hunt monsters. This IS pretty disturbing. (Or maybe he did and it's just not shown in the video.) Poor kid.
I kinda wanna imagine what these kids jobs will be like in the future  like i feel like Delaney will keep a lot of her energy and definitely do something ecclectic Devin has a good chance of doing sports or whatever outdoor activity he could love, though he WAS just turned into a political activist by taking a class on global warming  and Bo........... I do not wanna guess what could happen with Bo
CANARY
i’m loving these Assassination Classroom cameos 😍😍😍
0:22 ....I NEED those haikyuu jackets
Oh my god. I so relate to the "WATER"gun problem. The boys in my first grade always play guns and shoot at each other. If they get confronted not to play pretend real weapons, they just say:"It's not real guns, it's waterguns!" well yeah obviously if they would shoot water they would go pew pew boom pampampampam and not like ffffffsch
I’m calling the care taker Mom...
Devin is gonna be a star activist one day
Bow Is Like My Lil’ Bro
omg I love the little anime details, especially the little photos of Midorya, Bakugou, Keigo, Touya, and Mirko on the computer i screeeeemed
The 114 dislikes are stupid 2nd amendment republicans
So what I'm hearing is: play REAL guns not pretend guns. Gotcha :)
I will never forget when I was a kid
Ok the fact that the kid is being punished for playing "guns" is stupid and small brain thinking plain and simple. Kids have been playing cops and robbers for years. And yes obviously guns are a tool and parents should teach their children to handle guns with respect and care, but let me ask you this, if this boy has say pretended it was say a sword, playing knights would you have reacted the same? If it had been a hammer or been playing martial arts would you have taken the same procedures? These are all things that can hurt people and in the wrong persons hands are just as dangerous as a gun. And yet, children play star wars without being  stopped, why? Because they are being imaginative. Guns aren't some dangerous topics that must never be spoke of, actually preparing your kids and teaching them will probably help them in the long run. Not only will they know how to use this tool because that is exactly what it is a tool. To do what they need to, but also understand the responsibility that comes with it.
Illymation: dont play pretend guns  Kid: plays real guns
I am Delaney this Delaney sounds a lil like how I was when I was littke .
No Yeah No  *YEAH*
Is- is that Soul from Soul Eater?!?!?
I saw the kirishima play and got very happy 🥰🥰🥰
I love all the hidden anime references 😂
PLEASE, ANYTHING BUT TIME OUT
Another video already?! Boy what a good christmas gift from Ilyssa to us all!
Sweet video.
Bo *sings pumped up kicks*
All of this is true
Um one of thos kids was me and he killed me so many times 🥺
Merry Christmas to all and to a good Animation!
Alright I work at an afterschool program during the school year and I have so many stories. I also worked at preschool too. I am 100% starting a youtube channel now. This really inspired me to actually tell my stories because boy do I have some
Let’s be real here, guns are related to... a lot of negative stuff... and most people do use them for negative stuff... I am not dumb I know that... but there is generally less crime in places where guns are legal to use and have with government control and tuition over them than where there isn’t, idk why, maybe because people fear someone will shoot them down if they try to shoot someone down without a reason... I don’t know the ins and outs I am not in a place like that. But I do understand why people want there to be no guns in the first place, cause you know it is way better if guns weren’t use in the absolute than to need gun control and common use and tuition of their use for there to be less crimes but facts are facts, I do understand also why people want guns... you know, for self defense and protecting their family... but guns should not be treated as toys and the tuition about them is needed to be taken seriously cause people without proper education might end up shooting themselves. It is a controversial topic but both parties are understandable and in my opinion, I would do whatever assures me there will be less crime for the well being of my people and country, banning guns only provokes people to buy them illegally and use them illegally while in countries where there is control of the gun usage and education has less crime, It may be scary but things are how they are for a reason, not saying you should let your kid play with that topic like it was nothing, but maybe when they are old enough you should talk about the topic for them to understand deeply what it means and make responsible decisions whether those may be staying away from guns or if they get one to learn what it means to have one, use one, and the situations it is legal to use one and even more so if it’s against people as a means of saving their or others’ lives
Everyone let’s make a line of pew pews in the comments and try not to get to time out 🤣🤣🤣
Uroborus Fullmetal Alchemist tattoo on your computer? Mad respect. 👌
Merry Xmas :D Tomorrow......
Why Devin look like illy's brother OwO
Pew pew OH SHOOT THE PO PO
“Karen” is definitely an appropriate name for that lady lol
My sister and I also went to a daycare/school when we were younger and my sister works there now because our old teacher offered her a job. She had a story about a kid we’ll call Joe. My sister works usually with 3-5 year olds and most of them are potty trained but not...always. So basically Joe had a bad accident and apparently it smelled horrible so my sister not wanting to have to clean him up, sent Joe to go play by a different teacher so they would notice it and clean it up for her.   That only happened once, my sister is a good employee.
*plays pretend guns*
I bet Karen was a Gemini
hi this is not hate but did you change the way you draw your nose
I think we can all agree Karen was by far the most childish in the story
Illy:  *Don't pretend to play guns or I will send you to timeout!* Me:  OH NO MY PIGGY
I would okay pretend guns when I was a kid, but it was only because I had seen the resident evil movies and I thought killing zombies was cool. We would pretend to be like cornered and would pretend to fight our way to a safe room
WERE YOU GUARDING CANARY ?
Illy:...I'll call her... Me:  Idiot- Illy:  *Karen* Me:  Fair enough.
The amount of anime references in this video is amazing
I SAW THE ALL MIGHT PLUSHIE OMG
3:18 I see Soma Yukihira in the background
I’ve never seen a picture of Natsuo and Hawks drawn until now
It would be funny if someone did a parody story-time channel where absolutely nothing happens. Like the story of going to school, going home and sleeping.
pew pew
can We just give a shout out to Ms. Sheriff for being cool
Me in the corner with a large collection of nerf guns...
Ahhh alot more anime references good job ingrid 👌 this is        *PERFECTO*
I wanna part 2 pls I won't play guns
When me and my siblings would play pretend we played guns all the time. But it wasn’t every time, we knew about gun violence because we had a lot of violence in our neighborhood and love movies. Also I had older brothers and cousins (around 19 and we were 6-10) who played graphic video games. It’s nice to see a different perspective on how others were brought up.   And don’t worry my family isnt the type to defend the second amendment
* bang bang* I'M NOT GOING BACK TO JAILLL
dumd
A "previous job" story that ISN'T a tale of total agony?! It's a Christmas Miracle!
Devin....I just love him
I keep seeing anime references
OMG I SOMA I LOVE U ILLYYYYYY
Illy: “I really don’t watch any anime..”  *literally has an anime character in the background of every scene*
The amount of anime references mostly assassination classroom is amazing.
As a kid i never got into pretend guns. I was the swords and magic kid. Guns were boring unless they had lasers and even that, being a ferromancer or pryomancer was more fun that pretend super solider.
5:15 dear lord that hairstyle should have a trigger warning, I've never had to deal with a Karen first hand but boy oh boy I live in fear of that day
Merry Christmas and a Happy New year
Me and my friends who pretended to load finger guns as if they were different firearms: *Shakes nervously*
I love all the anime references in her videos
"DON'T PLAY PRETEND GUNS OR I WILL SEND YOU TO TIME OUT!!"      me: *casually plays real guns*
The amount of different anime characters being displayed around the daycare makes me happy, there was like 1 Koro-sensei in every scene. I saw Haikyuu!, Naruto, Assassination classroom, Pokemon, BNHA,  Hunter x Hunter, Soul eater, Food wars,  Demon slayer and AOT. Truly beautiful!
yummy
I’m personally pro-second amendment but I also think that there should be certain safety restrictions. It’s also royally fucked up that someone did not see a problem with their SIX year old son SHOOTING his friends.
Is that doll one of the food wars characters
It's almost 2021...         And I'm still here for the chaos
Merry Christmas
Bo has issues
I love how you added gon in the first scene!
My elementary school didn’t allow us to do finger guns and every art lesson I did my art teacher would say and I quote “No words, no blood, guts and gore” so I am questioning is this just them not wanting us to ave bad behavior or did students before us really screw up
"NOOOOO" "YEAHHHHHHH" "Noooooooo" "Yeahhhhhhhh" "NoOoOoOoO" "YeAaHhHhH"
Slowly puts pretend gun away
Stan Devin
So wait, did Illy send the cast of Persona 3 and Persona 5 to timeout?
Heheheh. Pew pew.  U ded
So why is there assassination classroom in the class that’s SUS
I am sorry but global warming is a myth
I love your glasses
My Evil Annoying Sister : *hears me watching this video and hears Illy saying the word guns* My Evil Annoying Sister : *Shoots with nerf gun and nerf gun bullets every time She hears ILLy say guns*\ Me : *cries* ;--;
I love the All Might plush in the back at 1:49
AHHHH SHE POSTED
I love seeing, the little anime and video game Characters in the background
4:54 did u guys notice all the anime character toys on the shelf 😂
"Dont play pretend with guns or I'll send you to time out"  Me who is watching this on the way to the shooting range: ummm
OMG BABY DEKU,KACHAN, HAWKS AND NATSO, AND MIRIKO I WISH I WENT TO THAT AFTER SCHOOL
1:21 Luigi's here for the chaos!
Daaaaang. As someone who works with kids during the summer in the south and knows people with parents like the Karen you described, I hope I don’t have to deal with that crap.
I saw this 3 hours after it was uploaded
Pew pew
.
I don’t think an after school program should have a food wars toy.
*plays guns*  Hehe what ya gonna do ÒwÓ
3:43 where is rushlightinvader 😭
*sees all the Koro-sensei dolls* This isn't an assassination classroom is it?
EY GUYS LET'S PLAY PRETEND GUNS IN HER  COMMENT SECTION

1:18 so your a fen of fullmetal alchemist ans attack on Titans and naruto
Happy holiday
R2-D2 47 is my favorite gun
I thought the supervisor wasn't gonna believe you when you told her that the mom was two-faced and I was gonna throw hands
Best quote of 2020: don't play pretend guns or I will send you to timeout!                           -ilymation 2020 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Happy holidays

this is the most I have laughed at your videos ever. And that's saying something.
Hi iliy  I love ur vids and when you see this you're amazing
Okay can I just say  I loved all those anime references!
Am I the only one who noticed the Mha photos on Mrs. Sheriffs office board??
I love how there’s just mha references everywhere
ı like how her videos just keep getting more anime references
You think that kid was young to play with pretend guns!?  I have a nephew that is 3 and he likes to play Call of Duty and zombie games and likes to have toy guns and pretends to shoot us.  I really don't like how his parents are raising him.
I love the pictures and plushies in the background of different anime characters, and just loved the hole video in general!!! Amazing work!😁❤
0:30 damn Luigi, you got some ✨ M O V E S ✨
😵👈 im playing guns
I love how you explain all the character with love.
I’ll play pretend guns anyway and recreate  9/11 with the two big blocks.
I literally have a cousin named Devin and he looks like that
Happy Holidays Ily! :D
Pew pew!🔫🔫🔫 Bang! Bang! I play guns!🔫
Petition to stop the existence of Karens
Pew pew 🔫
Bro when I was a kid I just played pretend nothing because I had no friends
"How many anime references do you want?" Illy: "Yes."
Merry Christmas! This video was funny
R2-D2 47 😂
4:40 KACHAN AND IZUKU
Ya I believe some ppl have the right to own guns...her and family lost it big time.  Oh edit: happy holidays everyone!

So you’re saying we shouldn’t PRETEND guns, I see. Thank you for this fact and if you excuse me I need to find that glock.
I love all the anime references 🙌🙌🙌
Pew pew
IM NOT GOING BACK TO TIME OUT!
Jail for a kid ha the real jail for a kid is not being able to go to your uncle's on Christmas Eve when you've done at your whole life and the only reason you can't go is because virus
"Pretend it was an R2D2 47 or something" IM DEADDDD
The kids are alright? The offspring would like to have a word
The whole thing of the gun part let me guess America?
"Ma'am, have you ever heard of a shooting range? There are other places in America where you can use guns freely, other than schools and malls."
Omg hawks,Naruto plushies
Imagining a R2D2 gun is probably the most fun I had watching this video  4:55
As someone that have a mother that work with children (i think The equivalent would be an elementary school teacher) and hear a mot of stories about misbehsving children and overreacting parents.... You got off easy xD
Fun fact about my days in elementary school: One time, my dad was into call of duty and lil ol' me watched him play it whenever I would see him. So one day at school I pretended to shoot a gun that wasnt life-like, so one of the teachers caught me doing it a recess. And this teacher was mad, she grabbed me by the arm and said "we are going to the principal" in a rude manner. We arrive in the principal's office and the principal, was not a nice principal. He was so mad he called my grandmother and told her that I was playing pretend guns, even tho to me it was not a graphic way, it didnt make anyone cry, or even hurt anyone. So my grandmother gets mad at them and takes me home early. So that's what happened in elementary school. Also, illymations, please dont send me to timeout
We should get more of this type of story stupid funny please
:D
Haha I’m playing pretend guns with blocks what you gonna do about it
Spicy nuggets are best nuggets
was that a kirishima :o
Dang she got better at animating 🤠💕
illy do you like demon slayer?
I wont play pretend guns, i promise.... ill play real guns
Technically you could also be one of the Disney fairies :D
Koro Sensei
Illy she's  an entitled single mother
Time out......        Crime out
Those 100 dislikes are all the Karen’s.
silly republicans
I'm going into this for a career. Kids can be a joy to work with. I am also welcomed with a hoarde of midgets when I enter the room.
the infamous russian r2d2-47 known for mowing down enemies like grass a weapon that is banned by the Geneva Convention it’s a good thing you stepped in when you did, that kid could have committed genocide.
Bo ok guns bad but nife ok
When your six years old and want to commit arson.
Happy holidays!🤶🎄🎁🎅❄☃️
Pew pew littel jemie
I luv this.. 💖
The first name you used 'Delaney' is my name and she is the opposite of me.
But I got hunting
Illy Who's your favorite mha character
You know things are about to go down when you see that haircut-
I love all the anime I guess easter eggs
Kore sensai  assassination classroom  ending  Literally everyone  Why must you hurt me in this way   See how the heart is all chopped up
Never stop animating you bring me so much happiness and joy and you are just the funniest person
Good moral.:)
4:55  I see you All Might and Hawks 👀
illy: hit like if you liked it. hit subscribe to see more. illy: don't play pretend guns or i will send you to time out!!! me:"plays pretend guns because i can and i want to be on r/madlads"
This is a job Id kill to have.
Am I the only one who got so happy when illy said that Devin was so upset about pollution?
I know I’m supposed to focus on the video but all I can focus on  are the small anime references
i love how when illy was talking about the first kid all might hawks and naruto were just smiling her way :)
2:20 George soros  2:40 i see we got a lolcow future  greta thunberg  also climate change is a myth just like the flat earth. 4:10 na just give him a BB gun he should be fine wow they really went down hill when you can't even pretend with guns anymore  have  they  even heard of cap guns before wonder what's the results if he pretend he had a bow and arrows 7:25 bang bang good luck with that
Kind of early :D
I wonder how bad Karen's husband is
I have a similar job and this 5 grader asked if trump was coming because she didn’t want to marry her and said she would marry Biden
TimTom and illy upload on the same day   Me:which one first
You and your team did such a great job on this one!
*grabs the big block* It's show time
Your video was awesome
OH MY GOSH YESSS MORE ANIME REFERENCES!!!!!
Here's how you explain that to this women. Mam you would not let your kid watch a rusted R movie with guns but even thought that's fake you round do it
The Second Amendment stupid
As a daycare teacher in a big kid room some parents are shit people. One of my kids got in trouble so their punishment was that I would take their choices away, this means I choose their next center. So I choose their center as table toys and all our toys there are in themes boxes that are mixed up with different toys. Well I gave this child a random ass box that later turned out to be fantasy. So knights, dragons, princesses. After a while their mom comes in and then I get a complaint about how I’m trying to bully her son and try to turn him gay because the box had princesses in them, like what the fuck.
Happy Christmas Tomorrow everyone
HAWKS ON DA BOOKSHELF WHAT WILL HE DO
Naruto you made a NARUTO Toy on the back round
“Don’t play with guns or I will put you in time out.”   6 year old me: :0
As someone who works with kids for a living, I can so totally relate. I've had kids like yours and I loved them all dearly, but also couldn't stand them, but it was so worth it. Happy Holidays!
Being told “you’re almost an adult” by a child when you’re still a teenager is the most saddest thing ever
Pew
I love the kirishima and hawks and all might plushies
:0 koro sensei
I love all the anime references in the video.
I mean what the mother did was like wow. I don't think playing guns in on itself is that bad depending on the context. Like if the kid pretends to shoot a evil monster or I don't know Hitler. I mean a really little kid probably doesn't understand the real weight of what shooting or killing someone is. I'm not a parent but I'd definitely not do or say what the mom said ever. Loved the video really brightened up my day have a happy holiday and be safe.
Merry Chrismas!!!!
i like these anime dolls in the background and the boku no hero pics and the food wars doll and  the pic did i miss any more anime easter eggs?
Being a preschool teacher is honestly so rewarding for me 🥺

"DON'T PLAY PRETEND GUNS OR I WILL SEND YOU TO TIME OUT!!!"  Me: aight' *Proceeds to pull out real AK-47*
sick new vid
I love how Karen has illys teenage makeup 😂❤️
"It's just pretend"  If the mother understood anything about the human brain and human development, she probably wouldn't say that. But also, if the child was pretending to do something else, she would probably be freaking out. Like, given that it's the south which is traditionally very religious, what if the child was pretending to summon satan? That mother would probably start freaking out, but hey, "it's just pretend."  *Edited for grammar*
Sorry, but getting punished for "playing Guns" is wrong. I agree with the mother on this and wouldn't have let up just because Ms Sherriff walked in.
4:21 ILLY DREW TOUYA AND HAWKS AND MIRUKO AND DEKU AND BAKUGOU AND IM SO HAPPY-
MAAM WHY ARE THERE ANIEM CARACETRS
3:17: well, guess now we know how bakugo grew up

5:25 koro on the calendar
*too bad i already pretend to use air guns like an ak-47, an Rpg, a glock-17, an ar-19*
1:13 WOAH there illy, i see that survey corps sticker..  SHINZOU WO SASAGEYO
I love the HxH reference
Aww man i wanted to play guns too
Great video as always illy  Also I think bow likes to play guns because his mom lets him play cod witch he shouldn’t play because it’s rated M  Also sometime I would love to just chat with you and hang out because I like you you’re pretty chill my friend
The fact the kid only liked playing guns and pretending to kill his friends and his mom being a Karen. That kid must be suffering so much at home. Just imagine when he’s on the car home he gets chewed out on dumb reasons like “You wasted my time.” Or something like that. When that kid is in middle school things might get pretty bad.
I know a lot of Karen’s and Ken’s out there and this was adorable I used to work with children myself so XD
Thats a girl?
what if people play real guns? Also that was in America what do you expect?
0:42 don't think I didn't see that Korosensei in the backround
Hey,, hey guys Don't tell miss illy  🔫🔫🔫
i love all of the anime references i had to pause just to make sure i didn’t miss any :D

IIy: "DON'T PLAY WITH GUNS OR I'LL PUT YOU IN TIME OUT!!!" Me:  Phew! Phew! >:3
Ily:Don’t play pretend guns or I will put you in super timeout Me:slowly puts down fake gun
I cannot tell you how relatable this is!! I work in a daycare as well, the kids are quite the colorful bunch! ^_^ but the parents...ugh!!
Sorry if this is weird but the new end-card is so cool!
I hope that kid never gets a real gun!
IM NOT GOING BACK TO TIMEOUT ALYSSA

Gun go brrrr
I love all the little anime things in the background that make me so happy
I love the little anime easter eggs
delaney sounds like ruby from rwby
*me realising all of the Assasination Classroom and MHA, also all of the other anime refrences*  :0 Anime buddie?
Psh, R2-D2-47... Please! The proper name you're looking for is TK-421.  It's okay. I know you're doing your Beskar.
This was legendary 🤪
Who else saw the picture of her and her friend in haikyuu jackets in the background
The kid does seem like a Delaney type though.  All Delaneys are like that.  I say this AS one.  We have a secret society. 😐
And this is why I’m in university to become an elementary school teacher 💓 they know what’s up... most of the time
I don't remember much when I was in kindergarten. Just that I always got in trouble.  I always hated playing with dolls and the color pink so I played with the boys instead, since they seem cooler.   Pretty much I got into lots of timeouts because my behavior was not aloud. I liked to play in the dirt and jump in puddles with the boys. ... And got into playful wrestlings that I kind of started and always almost played a bit to rough on them...  So yeah... I was always a tomboy, even since then.   (Does anyone else have a kindergarten story to tell?)
I SAW A KORO SENSEI IN THE BACKGROUND!!
she was def a trump supporter-
Bu the anime plushies in the background tho-
I'm a Kindergardener and I know kids that could act just Like this XD
I plays probably 200 games that have guns and gore so you better come to California. Just kidding this was a joke, most of it except for the games
i see that haikyuu reference
Aweee I loved this!
Yeah Luigi dance
I am bo
The dislikes are from Karen and her friends :))
Merry Christmas to all hope you have the best Christmas
My favorite game with kids is "guess how old I am"
The anime Easter eggs!
1:07 um..excuse me did I see that right?      Is that NARUTO?!?
I worked for 10 years in childcare here and stories like this hit home. I don’t know how many times we had to deal with behavioural issues with kids who were given GTA And other games like that at a young age, and proceed to do just that with their friends. The conversations that ensued were exactly like what you described. Parents who had no problem cussing you out, and as soon as a supervisor walked in you’re doing great. One of the main reasons why I left the toxic environment that was that job (plus horrible management and favouritism between them and other staff). The kids were great though and they are the only thing I miss
there aare 3 anime rafrences and the animes are my hero acadamia, asasnination classroom and naruto
Nooo not time OUT!!!!!!!
this made me so happy, thank you :)
i would be delaney im always happy :D
I can relate the gun child hahaha
the "don't play pretend gins or I will send you to time out" was hilarious an I didn't see it coming
Hey, I love Dale
R2D2 47 BAHA
I’m just one our late
awww time out for me i like to pew pew
Honestly we all had a bow in kindergarten I know i did they are just all insane and like guns
1:09 assassination class room
Someone probably already said this but I saw the Hawks and All Might Plushies and my heart is just *happy opossum noises* + all of the other anime references
Karen lady is my dad I a nutshell.
Pew pew (gun noises)
*finger guns*  illy: NO. TIME OUT YOU GO
I believe that guns ( rifles, pistols, etc ) should not be confiscated but because they are used for hunting and range competitions. Pointing a gun at someone is inappropriate and I agree should not be tolerated.
So many anime references. And I'm here for it!
Where did u work at?
Hey maybe you can play games like people say the number of the animes you put in the video and if you so they get a shout out
Honestly, Bo should be able to play pretend guns. After all, he's just pretending to kill all his friends.                                                     Obvious  J O K E .
*NO! NOT IN TIME OUT!!!* *I WAS JUST PLAYING THIS GTA GAME!*
*pew pew.*
i saw all the anime refrences nice
I never noticed the stylized background designs in your vids before. Stripes and dots and stuff.   Oh so you have a team! AWESOME!!
Karen: why can't he pretend to kill things it's just pretend !!!  illy : 👁️👄👁️.........these are kids
Am I the only one that notice at the start the one of the  kids looked like gon from hxh
Kieran: what’s wrong with guns  George Washington: am I a joke to you Call of duty: guns are awesome
You were 19 at the time so. Technically you were already an adult. Just a very young one. That’s all I can say In my honesty.
love the anime plushies in the background and the teacher has pictures of my hero academia characters
Hiii Illy ur soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo amazing and im a big fan of u and je the best. Stay safe!!!💖💖✨✨✨✨✨✨✨✨🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋
i wish i went there....it'd be so dope to see this vid and be like......      *OMG MS ILYSSA* (sorry if i spelled her name wrong)
Also being a Miss Alyssa, it was a trip watching this.
yes, this is a karen
Is no one gonna talk about all the assassination classroom references??? 😂
Merry Christmas Illy!!!!
4:20 The anime posters... (人*´∀｀)｡*ﾟ+
EALRY!!! Heeeyy
What’s wrong with guns ? Nothing if the person using it knows it can hurt people in painful ways and follows every gun safety there is it’s not a toy it’s a powerful weapon
Koro-sensei in the background!!!!!
That little boy reminds me of my cousin hahaha
4:55 HE SHOT HAWKS😭😭😭😔😔🖤🖤🖤💔🥀🥀💔💔🥀🥀🥀 (joke)
Was anyone else trying to see all the anime stuff in the back round
1:08 ASSASSINATION CLASSROOM >:]
how i play not-pretend guns?     this is a joke mr fbi. this is a god damn joke.
Playing guns is just a boy thing to do.
*Hi my name is Delaney I have two lucy my favorite color is yellow because it's bright and happy wonderful like the sun!*
hawks in the background tho
2:05 Is that Soma in the corner?

Cringe
Early pog
Pew pew! I sure hope I don’t get thrown in jail
2:05 Kirirshima chilling in the background
Can we PLEASE get more stories from this job??!?!?!!
hehe  PEW PEW
When I was a kid people in my class littered in the yard and I was pissed
I love all of the Hidden anime stuff
We should really call that dance the Luigi boogie
ABNORMAL CHAOS!!! I LOVE HER SO MUCH
That intro was absolutely golden
SHES A NISHINOYA KIN I REPEAT SHES A NISHINOYA KIN (or a hinata one)
I'm sorry but whenever I see Koro sensei I cry
YAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Oh boy this takes me back to when I worked at a place that a lot of kids and their parents would come. Loved the kids, it was very very rare any of them were bratty or mean or rude. And even if they were, usually the parents were at fault for being neglectful or not setting proper boundaries or being nasty themselves. I'd actually say the vast majority of the parents were either highly irresponsible or just plain nasty whereas the vast majority of the children were very sweet and I really loved interacting with them. I miss that aspect of the job but I would never go back cus dealing with the parents was a nightmare at times.
Happy holidays to you illy
*picks up rifle with a scope*
I went to a day center for kids and there was an area up some stairs where there were dress up items, blocks, and those big foam shapes.  Whoever was up there was always the coolest kid there
Am 19 to am still have nerf guns 😂
Here’s the thing, playing guns is fine IF you teach them how to do it well. For example, I played cops and robbers a lot and every time we “shot” someone, it went they were in prison. But there are other examples where it’s not okay. I have a cousin who’s dad taught him about guns at the age of 3 so he could be a macho. Now, when he gets mad, he does finger guns and says he’ll kill you. It’s pretty obvious what the right and wrong examples are.
Illisa! i love your vids :)
I got so distracted by how many anime references were in the video, and I love it
Omg , my mom was elementary school teacher and I used to go volunteer in her classroom every once in a while,  The kids used to call me young- old
pls dont send me to time out i played pretend heist with water guns alot when i was younger
4:38 I love all the references I see you illy 😆👌❤
0:52 Haikyuu!! Reference
The little anime dolls in the background 🥺 I love it
And don’t play real guns or else you’ll go to adult time out
I mean Devin isn’t wrong... plastic is a pretty big issue and it does contribute to climate change (an even bigger issue).
Its funny how there was a food war plushie in a very young school....... 2:06
me: sees even more anime references me: GREAT!!!!!! NOW I NEED EVEN MORE ANSWERS!!!!!!
Karen: "WHY CAN'T MY CHILD PLAY PRETEND WITH GUNS?!"   Karen the next day: "my child will not be at the daycare today because he lost a finger...all because SOMEONE let him play with PRETEND GUNS and he found our REAL ONE WITH NO SAFETY LOCK!!! #$%%+#"
I'M HERE FOR THE CHAOS!!!!
One of my favorite things when watching your videos is to try to find all of the anime references
is that a korosensei plush i see in the backrounf.....hell yeas.
The amount of anume references in this amazing
0:23 u went to KARASUNO?!?!?!?!?!
illy: How do I say this? Water....guns Youtube: aight ill allow it
As someone who volunteered for a summer camp/after-school camp for 5 years, literally everything here is 100% accurate. I have stories to about different kids, staff members and even parents from over the years.
I love the assassination classroom references
Okay but the r2d2-47 is the best fake gun name ive heard
How much you want to bet Karen is a trump supporter
I thinks Karen scared of mrs. sheriff
I don’t see a problem he’s just your average American in training
Karen: What's wrong with guns?   *silence*   Illy: 0_0     Illy: M-mam this is a ChiLD?
Pew pew, it’s not a gun, it’s a laser!
those kids watching this video now  calm, calm, *realization*
Ok so, there were My Hero, Haikyuu and Pokémon and          *do my eyes deceive me? Was there a Food Wars toy thing?*
Illumumiti
So did anyone noticed the Mha  pictures in the background or was that just me
Merry Christmas
3:16 man I wish there were classroom that looked this pretty- just look at the walllll Lmao it’s prolly cuz I like the colour purple and blue but damnnn I live for these backgrounds
Wow, 😂 that lady really is a Karen *it suits best*
I’m loving all the anime cameos
Is anyone going to mention the hawks plushie?
So uhh, can’t be only me who rewatched the video JUST to find all the anime references?
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
Hi Illy,   I don't know if you are really ever going to read this, but I wanted to thank you for something... You see, last month, when you upload your video about you joining your swimming team at school, something got stock with me that really helped me to pass a very VERY difficult exam that, at the time, I was really afraid of. In that last race you talked about, you got second because you concentrated just in what YOU were doing, instead of paying attention to the adversities you were facing. This really inspired me, and I applied that to my way of studying, one step at the time, and just focusing on that, not the odds of me failing. With that, I passed flawlessly, literally I got the best mark possible. And it's partially because of you.  Thank you Illy, and happy holidays.
Pew pew
im obsessed with all the anime references snuck in your videos
Why do so many animators used to be teachers
This lady wasn’t a karen...  She was a mega karen
My brother was a gun person, and he played gun games- and he’s like 9
Bow reminds me of my friend tyrecess
Hi Illy 🙂
1:09 why you gotta do my boy Nagisa like that
Me and my friends played guns growing up and we are all well adjusted people
You can see a Naruto doll in the background
illymation is a motivational speaker just do what she says and you won't get put into time out its that simple.
Can I have a shoutout
1:22 Luigi do be shmoovin
Im watching this in 1:20
YESSSSS, ANOTHER VIDEO . Also have a good christmas or holiday!!
I love all the anime references you scatter throughout your video! The haikyuu one at the end was my favorite. XD
what if you break to time out chair
I recently watched a news video about a 9 year old who shot a 6 year old 😔
Welp I'm 14 so u cant put me In timeout
Yep, we are absolutely off our rockers!! There's a kid in our class who is constantly : *racist (my best friend is Jewish and he (and his friends) always say wayyyyyy inappropriate stuff to her ,  homophobic (same friend tells me that it's better I don't know what they said to make her soooooo mad and talks about guns and sexual things a under 16 year-old should not know!!!!!*
But but my nerf guns
Hi
I have a feeling that bo is gonna help paint his new school, I hope they like red
The assassination classroom THAT ONES NEW! :D
Ahhh I love all of the amazing anime references!!!
Karen: what’s wrong with guns? Me: what’s wrong with you?
Ok but Ms.Alyssa is really fun to say and idk why
“And I’ll call her ... Karen!”  Oh.  _oh no_
1:09 Korosensei and Nagisa from Assasination Classroom
Hi I didn't know what to comment
Karen: its just pReTEnD  Illy: ma'am this is a daycare
I am thriving with all the hxh references
Who else notice Abnormal Chaos :D
Well I do agree with the 2nd amendment but 6 year olds don’t need to be pretending to kill people
Pew Pew
Definition for "a Karen" - Often a middle aged or elder woman - Known for causing unnecessary drama - Manipulates others around you to make you out to be bad person or to make her seem like a victim. - Yelling everything she says Fun facts: My kindergarten teacher was a Karen. I have a grandma named Karen.. she's actually nice
Love the Koro Sensei on the calendar in the background
The 2nd amendment gives " Bo " a CONSTITUTIONAl right to " bear and keep arms. "  As quoted from Amendment 2 of the United States Constitution ( Bill Of Rights ), " A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. " In this instance, the " Militia " is composed of one person ( " Bo " ) and even though it was a PRETEND GUN, he still has a Constitutional right to keep it, and so taking it away from him would Technically be K I N D A breaking a Constitutional law.  You better have a good Lawyer, this could get messy.....
I'm confused, did I just watch a reenactment of a lady with dissociative identity disorder, a Texan mother or a person who really needs some parenting books?
Yep been there done that’s 😭😄😆☺️😹😹🤣😁😁🤦🏼🤦🏼😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😃😃😃😀😀😆🤣🤦🏼🤦🏼😁🤣🤣😆😆😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😆🤣😅😅😂😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤦🏼🤦🏼🤦🏼🤪🤪😁😁😹😹😹😹😄😄😄😄😹😀😃😄😄😁😁😆😆😁😁😁😅😂😂😂🤣😂😂😀😀😃😃😃😄😄😁😆😆😁🤦🏼🤪😃😀😅😹🤣😆😆😂😄😄😁😁😁😁😄😂😭😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😃😹🤣🤣🤣😹😅😀😀😀😀😀😀🤦🏼🤪🤪🤦🏼🤦🏼😃😃😃😃😀😀😀😀😀😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😭😆😆🤣🤣😹😹😹😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😃😀😀😀😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😁😁😄😂😂😭😭😭😭😆🤣🤣🤣😹😹😅😅😅😅😅🤦🏼🤦🏼🤪😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😃😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😃😃😃😃

Ms Sheriff was like: spill the tea sis 🥱💅
Now I want to be a after school teacher
I have horror stories from my time in childcare, all related to the parents. Rip
Alternative title: How I made world peace
This video makes me wanna pretend guns
I got a job as an assistant teacher at a preschool a few months ago and have been overjoyed ever since. Playing with guns is also a problem for our older kids, but thankfully none of our parents are upset about it.
Yay a video thank you so much Illy!!!
i liked the video before skipping the original ad
Apparentlyyyyy
Your uploading very consistently good job!
hi
Karen had the SMOOTHEST subject change transition EVER
As one who was a lead camp counselor for 3 years and had this exact experience, I want to know more about what happened to Karen.
Working with kids is easy, they follow rules and behave when needed... . . . . . . The parents tho... God help us
ok i will never play guns after this, i will play WORLD WAR THREEEEEEEEEEEEEE. lol
Thank you. I really needed this. The holidays are really rambunctious
I could pretend playing Guns whenever I want because I'm American
5:12 the SECOND I saw that mom I knew what was going to happen lmfao
*Finger guns.* Pew peeew.
This is sounds exactly like preschool teacher job
I mean, I’m personally fine with guns, but ya 6 years old is waaay too young for that.
Take a drink everytime Alyssa makes an anime reference
R2D2-47... 😂😂😂😂
i played pretend guns with my friends... a lot... *oh no*
I remember i got a heart from illy,then i cried
I worked with kids too. I use to teach them how to ski. But working with random rich kids can be way trickier. Not saying that your job couldn't be tough too. Any job involving kids will be. But rich kids suck. Not to mention your putting small children out in the cold to do something very physical and foreign to these kids because they're all from Texas. Not to mention these people do not know the most basic parts of ski safety and when you call them out on something dangerous they snap at you. So your keeping dumb adults away from equally dumb kids and trying to make sure that in the process you also don't get ran over by an idiot who can't stop. And they can't stop cause they saw it on TV and it looked easy to them, so they didn't get a lesson. Sorry for the rant, but it was also fun and some of those kids were really sweet.
Karen: “what’s wrong with guns?”   Excuse me madam
Oh yes the mixed signal parents. I've seen them all too often. Usually it's the ones who scold their kids for swearing and then turn around and unload a string of expletives at you right in front of them, but looks like you got an extreme case. Hope this wasn't a constant for Bo, that's got to be confusing for him. Also agree that morning kid hugs are the best.
Illy mation will you make a Chrismas video or live stream
Good thing I don't play with guns instead I play with swords the are made of wood which is wayyyyyyyyyyyyy safer.
THE BABY TOUYA AND BABY KEIGO PICTURE ALONG WITH THE BABY BAKUGOU AND BABY DEKU ONE 😭💖😭💖😭💖😭💖
Who else realized the pokemon in the background. Like if you realized 😏. (I'm kidding, you don't have to)
E
I STILL CANT GET OVER ALL THE ANIME REFRENCES!!! MY WEEB BRAIN IS SO HAPPYYYY
Am I the only one who saw some anime related objects ?
Pew pew
Did anyone catch any assasination classroom references? :)
i volunteered at my old summer camp and children can be the kindest people or they can be little hellions who ask you why they're not allowed to throw freshwater seaweed at that kid because they stuck their tongue out at them. i'd never want a long-term job there or with any children, but there's never a dull moment :D
Devin is such a Deku, look at that cute grin! Also: “POLLUTION.” Had me rolling 🤣
I like all the anime characters
I love that you have put koro-sensei ; hawks and naruto in the background :)
We need more of this
Why is there 69 likes
Pssst anyone wanna play guns when Illy isnt looking.  ̿̿ ̿'̿'\̵͇̿̿\з= ( ▀ ͜͞ʖ▀) =ε/̵͇̿̿/’̿’̿ ̿ ̿̿ ̿̿ ̿̿
Devin is an angel. No other words for him.
She didnt say anything about playing real guns   Cue: pumped up kicks
Hey Ily how is your day going so far?
illymation banning nerfguns 😲🙁
“What’s wrong with guns?” “Not much, it’s just something used for murder, robbery, kidnapping, threatening, and warfare”
mery mas great presents and stay healthy (i got mk live homecircut for xmas)
I kinda wished he said taxs
Omg I have a koro-senado calendar just like the  one in your video!! I also have some scout (attack on Titan) earrings like the sticker on your computer!
Yay
I love all the anime references
More stories on this topic pls
merry christmas
1:18 "What group of people remind me of this...?" *8th graders* "Yup, there they are."
We stan abnormal chaos
Man I majorly feel what the child was feeling when he found out about pollution 😔
Your ALMOST an adult..... That sentence crumbled her for the rest of her life.
Murderous kids are a bit more common than I like to admit. One girl used to torment neighbouring cats, kill the tadpoles and frogs in the community pond...and just raise alarm bells. Her parents even got investigated, but nothing untoward was found. She once brought a snail into class only to smash it dead for attention. My teacher's assistant then demanded she restore it to life. My GAWD,was that effective. The class stared, the girl broke down...She couldn't restore it! The class started to boo her. It all took mere seconds. I wasn't sure what to do except give the kid detention. Interestingly she is now running a wild bird sanctuary.
I am Southerner and live in sc that is not a normal child behavior but lol that is funny!  .P.S. I'am 12
Your videos are always so smoothly animated and enjoyable! Happy holidays! Also I see deku and bakugo
Boy she does run a strict  T O W N I hope you have a great Christmas illymations.
CAN I HAVE THAT KORO SENSEI CALENDAR PLEASE?!!!!!!!
Don’t mess with Illy. Timeout is a cold, dark place *shivers*
People like Illysa are not the reason you got your precious guns taken away. It's because you keep your finger on the trigger, definitely didn't take a class on how to use a gun, and probably hurt someone with your irresponsibility. Because of this and many more reasons, the police probably don't trust you with a butter knife. Let alone a 1911 handgun
Sir this is Wendy's
So much koro sensai
illy: Teaching was my favorite job   YouTube: ...Bish wuttt
This proves that not all children are evil,there’s *some* gems in there... :)
Man, you met some awesome kids...sorta aside from Bo. Every time I meet kids, they act like they’re 16 years old including my 11 year old sister lol.
Merry Christmas and holidays have a good new years
OMG ı love ur vids! Plz ı want a shoutout!
I promise I won’t play with fake guns because I personally don’t like time out I can’t even have my juice boxing that’s torture
4:56 ALLLLLL MIGHTTTTOOO
4:58 An AK-47
**Grabs Gun**  *Pew! Pew*
5 seconds in and I see at least 6 anime references, gotta love the culture.
We had a lunch lady named Mrs. Alyssa and I misheard it as Missa Alyssa so for  four years I never called her by her real name
Illy in my old school a punishment would be going to the little kids room instead of the big kids room
*starts playing guns*
Oh sweet an early Christmas present!
There are so many anime references dear god- Haikyuu, Assassination Classroom, Food Wars, etc
As a kumon tutor part time, I feel the struggles too
My name is Devin and I’m the opposite
Oh no Illy
Is it me or did the animation quality go up?😍
What if I play real guns?
Can I play real guns? I promise I'll be safe!
Merry Christmas
Oml I love and saw all of the anime references  Like haikyuu,  pokemon, assassination classroom, food wars, mha  demon slayer  and others, I  love it, good job illymation, your a real one👌
The Karen is a trump supporter. I bet all of my money that she’s a trump supporter
Im not even a minute into the video, and i already saw pokemon, Koro Sensei, and Haikyuu banner
Merry Christmas!! 🥳 TO YOU AND YOUR CAT ❤️
this Karen you speak of reminds me of a lot of my elementary school teacher assistant who once sent me home crying in fear to my mother...must have been a really bad time for her since she was also our next-door neighbor.
Karen's this days I love them the way that they talk the way that they are breaking laws aka not wearing a mask and more
I just love Illy’s channel ,she is so creative and funny.Also I love all the references in the background.If you see this Illy I just want to tell you that your amazing and keep doing the great work.💕
Pew pew
w e e g e e
Korosenseiiiiii
I can remember being in kindergarten... I probably could have had a better experience. But these children are so lucky to have you has there teacher! I really love little children as well.
Nobody: Karen : 6:05 what's wrong with gunz ?
For his neutral special, he wields a GUN
Ilissa : if she could be a food she would be Fun Dip Dalaini: himynameisDalainimyfavoritecolorisyellowbecauseitsbrightandhappylikethesuuun
Don’t play pretend guns or I will sent u to time out 😂
On 0:41 you can see koro sensei for a few clips :D
0:05 I forgot about soul eater
If only she was my teacher...
I love the anime references!!! Especially the my hero academia ones!!
Pew
Assassination classroom...
I just woke up to watch this video
* with wooden toy musket *   dOnT tElL mE wHaT tO dO-!
I like the calinder aka Assasstion classroom
So no fps games. Got it XD
0:37 ahhh yes, the family friendly assassination classroom calender.
NOT SPEAK ENGLISH ;-;-;-;-;-;;-;--;;-; PERO ME ENCANTAN TUS VIDEOS ♡♡♡♡
I fear the day that kid that likes to play gun pretend would step up his pretend game and become the quiet kid in high school.    /s
Illy call s her karen bec she had a child
the deku
2:20 honestly thought he was gonna say “do you know the muffin man”
Ooh we have spotted a weeb  1:09 assasination classroom prefrence And more oof     You cant hide anything from a weeb ¯\_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯
I DONT WANNA GO TO TIME OUT NO NO NO
This was “cringe, bad friend”
Dude Devon is just my brother, he always uses objects as guns 😐   *Please send my brother to time out*
"Don't play pretend guns OR I'M PUTTING YOU IN TIME OUT!"  OK. I'll play real guns! 😙
Is that pickle the dinosaur?
I don't know what year Illy was working here but the sad thing is, certain pretending can't be taken as simple pretend any more. When I was in high school there were very serious reports of shootings and or school bombings. (This was not at my school) So one day, my school had to evacuate and no one knew why until everyone learned someone wrote I am going to blow up the school on the bathroom wall. It was crazy, there was an intense investigation for bombs, the swat team was all over. I think we were outside there for about 4 hours. Thankfully the writing on the wall did not happen but still. I think the kid was found and expelled for writing that on the wall.
heheh.. Luigi dance
*Cocks Finger Gun* You Cant tell me what to do.
I use to work at Boys and Girls Brigade when I was 18-19. So the "almost an adult" comments was really common for me and it took them a while to respect me because in their eyes I was just a big kid. 😅
OMG YES. Some parents are ridiculous when it comes to their kids. Some think they know everything just because they pushed a child out of them but man oh man are they about 99% WRONG! Mind boggling how some people are allowed to have children still.
i always become more happy when i start watching your vids
Noooo!
Yeah so uh when I saw this video I was hiding from my brother and sister since they had those nerf guns
:O Assasination classroom calendar! 0:17
I did a lot of childcare too, and we had a kid pretty similar to "Beau". My Supervisor had the same policy, but I think that a perfectly healthy way to encourage good behavior about guns is to tell kids that they're never allowed to use guns to hurt good people, and they're only allowed to shoot bad guys. My parents did this with my family as kids and we all grew up learning gun safety. Guns are just tools, and as long as you encourage healthy ideas about the tools, there should be nothing wrong with them playing that way.   That being said, Illy totally acted the correct way, and was kind and polite about it.
Assassination classroom references!
HAWKS!!!! Me trying to spot all the anime references 🤣
Karens..... send them all to an abandoned island for time out
I want to go to a classroom with pokemon wallpaper and anime plushies!
When I was a kid I always played with imaginary guns with friends but we killed imaginary monsters bc my dad always told me to never point a gun to someone even if it's an imaginary guns 👌🏼
I was playing Halo earlier. Please don't send me to the out
I'm seeing more anime references
Am I the only one who noticed that there were anime characters hidden in the background?  Yeah it might be just me
As someone who works in retail, that Karen is drawn perfectly and closely resembles someone I served the other day. I've never wanted to punch someone so hard in my life up until the moment she slapped me with: *If it doesn't ring up right, it's free.*  No bich. That's not how this works anymore.
Make me go to time out, I dare you.  Pew pew 💥 🔫
I was just WAITING for an entitled parent story in this video, I swear--if there's ONE thing I hate more than internet trolls, its Entitled parents...😡
HAPPY CHRISTMAS EVE (at least with me it’s Christmas Eve)
WHat about nerf guns
ME: pulling up a handgun. illymations: STOP me: Fu...
OUT I love the assassanation classroom refrences
I'm 19 and that hurt
Beau is that kind of kid that thinjs he’s doing nice but he’s doing wrong
I’m just gonna point out THERE WAS A HAWKS PLUSHIE IN THE BACKGROUND
Geeze, that Karen lady REALLY wanted an excuse to get political for no reason. XD
"Alright, everyone, this is Miss Ilyssa!" -So "Ilyssa Illymation" isn't canon anymore?-
OMG there is  gon in the back ground and naruto plush and another from hunterxhunter but i forgot her name :( 0:06
I’ve never related more to a video in my entire life😂 still plan on going to college to teach little kids though
Has anyone talked ab all the anime Easter eggs like- illy’s got 110% respect from me
What about nerf gun
Parents are generally the problem. Good kids .. shit parents.. and I'm from the South.. played guns and have managed to not shoot anyone in the last 45 years.. soooooo pew pew
Min-Seo would be in time out all the time. (Look up butterfly soup if you're confused)
the anime references tho
thanks and I hope you stay safe and have a Merry Christmas
When I was little I stacked up legos and acted like they were guns, my parents told me not do to that (ofc) so instead it was turned  into a "tickle gun".
0:06  IS THAT SOUL IN THE BACKGROUND
Illy luv ya frm India
I love pokemon  Edit: on 5:00 I see MHA
Question can we play Pretend with real guns
飛べ
Who else saw the naruto plushie in the background at 3:09
The name karen fits the character very well...
I admire anyone who has the patience to work with kids. I mean I love kids, I just don’t have the mentality to work with them.
Yasss!
Just by the backrounds alone, I can tell EXACTLY what the room looked like lol.
I see hawks in the backround
Here not so late
If you look at the stuffies on the shelves you'll find Naruto, Hawks, and a smiley face. And the walls have pokemon and shukaku on them
I’m stressing trying to catch all those references
Who wants to play guns
SHE SAID DEVON SAID PLASTIC AND I GASPED- HE WAS MY FAVORITE CHARACTER BY FAR, AND WE ARE FRIENDS BECAUSE WE CAN TALK ABOUT GLOBAL WARMING TOGETHER :D
Maybe a dog shelter and you just get hugged by 7 year old dog
I fear for Beau's future. That's not a healthy environment for him...
I'm playing pretend guns
I kid play gun
Look at the dislike button its like a Pdw-57 smg i want to shove it in my friends skull while the like button is a upside down Pdw-57
Me Totally paying attention and not looking at the anime refs
As someone who has worked in childcare for the past 9 years... THIS VIDEO SAYS EVERYTHING!!! I once had a "Karen" chew me out cause her child had a sweaty back... "Ma'am we're a program that travels around the city in the middle of summer cause we don't have an actual facility, you also chose to dress your child in 100% cotton rather than breathable fabrics." Is what I would have liked to say, thankfully the coordinator was there to step in and back me up.
Name an animator that didn’t teach or work with kids for a period of their life... I’ll wait...   Ok obviously, Rebecca, Alex, and SomethingelseYT but I mean... COME ON!!! .Wolfychu  .Emirichu .theoddonesout .jaidenanimations .illymations THEY ALL WORKED WITH KIDS SOMEHOW!!!
I actually saw a Karen in the while-   Edit:it was amazing✨
1:15 anime stickers. Mood Fullmetal Alchemist Naruto Attack on Titan
What if I have a Bibi Gun?
YEAH KORO SENSEI!!!!!
1:09 .... My anime friends... you should know... or else I will assassinate you
*When you realize you where that one kid who was always super upbeat and happy*   What happened to me o-o
Damn 1 hour ago? I thouhht it was 1 month ago lol
Can I just say that there is nothing better than taking care of tiny children, cause they're perfect
1:09 hey its Nagisai and Korosensai!  Edit: yes I did see the other anime renferances
The Karen was drawn so perfect
My dad is someone who believes that global warming doesn't exist
the kid that played guns.... I swear to god I know him....  he sits next to me and pretends to shoot the class with his hands on his water bottle, he also pretends to be in GTA and when I ask him to stop he gets so defensive and says 'omg it's not my fault you don't understand my imagination!!!!!' and it's really annoying and concerning but I'm always kind to him :).
Love all of the easter eggs :3
Next vidcon everyone bring a toy gun
;-; Delaney is so precious
When i was a kid i was playing in the Park a whille my mom was taking a coffe in the pub and this girls comes at and she asks"can i paly whit you?" and accept so we played and out of nowere she ask me so she can paly whit my toys but i don't like to share toys beacause i know that the person will broke it so i said no, and she starts to trow a tantrum and she starts to ask for my mother and i say were she at and a whillie she goes to get my mom i climb a tree and when they were close i felled from the tree and said that she hurted me and blá blá......my mom get us along but i still didn't wanted to give her my toy so when my mom turned her back i claped my hands and telled my mom that the girl hitted me so we got away from the kid and that's my storie hehe

Did anyone else notice the anime references?
NOT TIME OUT ANYTHING BUT THAT PLEASSSSE I WILL STOP PLAYING WITH NURF GUNS
6:04 WHY!? WHATS WRONG WITH GUNS!?😳😂🤣
Considering what schools have become, I’m surprised they picked U and not a Sargent directly from the Marine Corps.
Kindergarten kids are mean, I remember that I was just chilling on the floor pondering about my 5 year old life when all of a sudden a kid comes and puts a chair on top of me, sitting on said chair trapping me, and then a 5-year-old gang (yeah three more kids) start kicking the sh*t out of me. Why , how don't really know XD
Anyone saw the assassination classroom teache on the calendar
*A N I M E   R E F E R E N C E S*
'lol, love that ending!
Crack cocain
Bro that cat was vibing.
Whan I saw the mom I was like oh no a Karen than she says her name is Karen I was like wait what
If you can't answer a question, just fire back with "that's above my pay grade".
Ima get you pew pew  💥🔫
No not time out 😮😦
1:43 rappers eminem was too scared to diss
wOW! IM PRETTY EARLY! I just want to say thank u for making me smile even on some of my worst days. I really enjoyed jumping up and down every time you posted and all those late nights watching your videos for probably the 6th time with my mom. You inspired me to start making my own animations and get better. i hope to be as good as you one day! Thank you for such a great year :)
Illy: don’t play with pretend guns Actors: what do I do then
Love how she blames u for guns being taken away and then her child shoots someone on accident "playing guns"  hmmmm I wonder why guns are being taken away.🤔🤔🤔
"What's wrong with Guns?" *HOLY SH*T* *THATS AMERICA AS* *F * * K*
(This waa before covid) but a while back I was skating in a skate park, and this Karen pushed me off my board told me how I was making her son jealous that I could skate- then told me to get off "her property" and proceeded to argue on everything I did- then I finally left because she was in the way of everything I was trying to do.
illy what's  you fav soul eater character mines crona :3
Canary in the introduction like: 👁👄👁
I actually work with kids too at my tae kwon do studio and we usually have a week long day camp for the kids. Two years ago there was a child that was running around with their friend when he accidently pooped on the carpet. That was not a fun time for any of us
I absolutely LOVE Ms. Sheriff!!
me: plays call of duty  her: DONT PLAY GUNS OR I WILL SEND YOU TO TIME OUT
Merry Christmas illy! I love u 😁
I loved all those WEEB references!!!
ken i pley vih wotor gans
Nobody: Me: **in the corner searching the comments for somebody else who thinks miss sheriff's design was based off of the cop character in epithet erased**
Who else knew Karen's name before illy told us
is nobody gonna talk about all the mha pics on her board at 4:39-
Dang a hxh and an assassins classroom ref in the first 19 sec And also 0:48 my hero Naruto and assassins classroom ref and Pokemon I guess
I'm honestly curious, how old is she now 😐
Can I just say that as an environmentalist I stan Devin and wish only the best for him in his future endeavors
I love it when you put the anime references! And you had Haikyuu!! and Food Wars this time!!
All the anime reference I can see: Haikyuu  Assassination classroom Naruto My hero academic  Pokemon And Food war This is all I see. Love your video illymation
If some person was renting about me putting their kid in time out for playing guns and pretending to kill someone right as someone else walked in and they acted nice I would rather them out like you cannot do that and right before they leave I would shout at them hey get back here and then in front of her tell the other person hey she actually was renting off about how her kid could play guns whenever he wants and that he shouldn't be in trouble for pretending to kill then I'll bend down and ask the little kid what's going on at home and if the kids mother tried to leave I would snatch the back of her weave and say her in the face what is going at home and if she tried to call the police I would grab the phone and hold it out then ask to put me on speakerphone to the police and say sorry for wasting your time but this person wants to call the police cuz I can't allow her son to play guns and play pretend kill and she was just renting on about how I shouldn't put her kid in trouble for pretending to kill all his friends
2:43 and he goes off about LITTERING, LANDFILLS, ACID RAIN, FOSSIL FUELS, ACID RAIN, CO2 EMISSIONS, OUR CABON FOOTPRINT!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥
Lol
These kids sound like animal crossing villagers
I'm kinda with the mum on this one ngl. when I was a 6 year old boy there was nothing I loved more then playing guns and playfighting   Now I'm a teenager who's gets made fun of for being the token Liberal in my friendship group. I'm an anti gun, pro lgbt+ feminist teenage boy, who still loves "playing gun" (airsoft) "playfighting" (martial arts) as well as stupid yet fun violent action movies like John wick and extraction. its just fun fantasy that doesn't reflect our actual attitudes toward violence
I used to make Lego guns so its to late for me.😥😓
Alisa:DONT PLAY GUNS OR I WILL SEND U TO TIME OUT!! Me:but can I play war zone?
An idea can turn into a habit and a habit can become a behavior.  -Mat1bat 2020   Without Karen's our society can't grow  -Mat1bat 2020
“DONT PLAY GUNS OR ILL SEND YOU TO TIME OUT”   **slowly drops nerf gun**
I've never worked with kids but I have a lot of friends who do, they never have any complaints about the children, it's always the parents!
Me who’s a kid “ha ha I know what it’s like to be a kid cause I am one ha ha”
STOP PUTTING ANIME REFERENCES IN YOUR BACKROUNDS I CANT PAY ATTENTION TO THE VIDEO BECAUSE NARUTO COULD JUST POP OUT OF NO WHERE
Hi Ms. Illysa...
Not related to the video but Happy Holidays to anyone reading this!
Listen, I love guns, they are pretty cool. But 6 year olds shouldn’t go around and pretend to shoot to other kids...
SO. MANY. ANIME. REFERENCES.  and i love it
*looks both sides and goes behind a couch pulls out big block.*  Hehehehe!  *Plays pretend gun.*

Uhhhhhhh yeah I’ve played call of duty and mortal combat since I was 6 and that’s the reason I drew guns in school
Hey illy what happens if i play game guns...........
Fun dip, smile dip. Smile dip...                                 THE FUTURE IS IN THE PAST! ONWARD, AOSHIMA!!!
Lol I played pretend guns all the time as a kid.
Let’s play pretend guns
*Picks up gun* Pew pew pew
This story reminded me of my days when I worked at Christian VBS and Summer Camp for three years. (Age 2-6) I love working with kids, I always have an interesting kid or kids. Unfortunately, the church moved away so I couldn’t get to the camp anymore. I did help my mother with an orchestra camp for young children this past summer and again met some interesting kids there. I hope next year I can help with another summer camp. As much as sometimes kids annoy people they’re the next generation we need to guide them as much as we can.
Happy Christmas to all who celebrate  !!!!!
You’re Empire is impresive
Hmm, this didn’t take long to come out.
As soon as I saw the Karen cut I just immediately thought that illy was going to name this woman Karen
3:44  Hey Laddi!
PEW PEW-- PEWWW!!!!!! Ilisa : NANI!??!? OMAE WA SHEINDERU TIME OUT!!
Description: ...Who eat off the floor. Me: Was I the only child who didn't?!
Karen: WHY Can’t he Pertend to Kill his Friends   illy:  ma’am This is A Child O.O
The kid that learnt about pollution looks a lot like me and it's hallirious
Marry Christmas.
"So you are almost an adult." Well, she wasn't wrong
At my aftercare, I played the magic kidnapping bus which was a Barbie bus that I would use to kidnap shopkins and other little toys that would fit inside it. I would then take them to a prison camp made out of Lincoln logs and make them my slaves.
“Don’t play pretend guns or I’ll send you to time out” Me: can I use a water gun?.... 🔫
You wanna know what's the worst thing in the world?  *P L A S T I C*
Hey don’t here on dale like that
im pro second amendment and all, but goodness i dislike this "karen" person. gives us legal gun owners a bad rep.
*These are some fine specimens*

My mom is school teacher and she says on the school is hell to be a teacher
Ummm.. I was playing guns while watching this can I have a pass??.         Me *PEW POW POW POP PEW PEW

This is my new favorite video of yours. :D
Sorry but soma doesn’t belong in school
Im eleven i play around with real guns
✨ASSASSINATION CLASSROOM✨ and my baby ✨Nagisa✨
Devin looks like my cousin
OMG. I'm a teacher and I relate so hard to this video. ‏ ‏Meeting parents sometimes explains so much. ‏
Lol
man i love how you show your otaku side in the entire video. i was spotting so many otaku references the entire time. just loved it. keep up the great work!
Illy is best babysitter (someone had to say it)
Tag yourself, I’m dancing Luigi

But, but.......             I wanted to play guns

The koro senseis in this video made me cry

We need guns there's so wild cougars out there
*gun noises* 🔫🔫
Just let the kid play with his pretend guns its not too bad 😂😂
Now this is going to be a ride
Is no one going to talk about the anime reference I saw SIX
Devin looks like Callus (Infinite)
Yes, my experience with parents of a-hole children is that they are also a-holes.
1:08 Believe it or not I wanted to perform as Genie in Aladdin a musical spectacular but sadly my chances were doomed😔😞
*Slowly puts away gun
4:20  okay,, i think that's deku and bakugou but if the other 2 are hawks and touya i'M GONNA LOSE IT (or i just woke up and my brain isn't working right now)
This is literally school, not a presidential campaign. WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS HERE?  This is definitely an American School. Let’s just leave it at that…
WHERES GON’S FROGGY IPAD
I would like to be a middle school math teacher
cool
R/EntitledParents
Cool 😎😎😎
Why does every animator uploads like 17 minutes later than the other like TimTom.                                                                          Bruh

My name is Alyssa too. A art teacher keeps getting my name wrong. Love ur vids!

Omg I really wish I could have been you at that moment because I would have said "yes and as someone who supports the second amendment you should KNOW that guns are NOT TOYS"
*Are we just going to ignore the fact that Luigi is just vibing with his belongings*
Karen used Confusion.  It was SUPER EFFECTIVE!
0:35 is that chrono from chrono trigger?
nooooo i dont wanna do time out i pinky promised jessica i would drink apple juice together in the book corner!!!
Illy: “Later his mom enters the story. I’ll call her-“ Me: I wonder if it’s gonna be Karen... Illy: “Karen!”
Hiii
iTs oK iTs jUst a NErF gUn 😀
Lily: " I know a million horrible things about the world. So what on God's green earth did you find out today?!"  How every teacher starts a conversation with their class in 2020
Awww the girl in 1:35 has the same name as me -w-
I hope Bo never finds a GI Joe...
There are still so many anime references and I love it!
When she added koro sensei and nagisa at 1:09 while i’m still watching it
But better
Are nerf guns an exception?
I mean guns are fine. But that is not ok for a child to do that... I am sorry...
Another awesome video! I really love your content!
As soon as I saw the video title I thought of how emirichu worked at a before/after care school thing, if illy and Emmy lived closer or worked at the same program then they would have been best friends and that would have been cool :) also great vid!
イリメイション
She said don't play pretend guns, nothing about real guns, WHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
You draw different
Am I being dumb or is k-5 a reference to k-12 xD, I'm probably just being dumb
When I was four I went to an after school program and would tell all the teachers to call me captain princess
4:55 can we please talk about the hawks plush and the volleyball from haikyuu
Dalaney isn't allowed to meet people on diet.
Merry Christmas eve everyone
I WAS WAITING THIS VIDEO FOR MONTHS (not really it was 3 week or i dunno)

Please I don't play for pretend guns but I have brothers and they have Nerf guns do they count cuz if so can you bring them to third time out thank you
Pee yee
1:09 Korosensei...the GOAT
I just recently finished hunter x hunter and as soon as i saw gon and the butler I was immediately got the reference
Happy holidays ilyssa
Send me to time out then I’m playing fortnite and borderlands 3
Anyone else notice Hawks in the background?
Watch, that kid is going to make a m4 assault rifle, suppresser, iron sight, and standard grip.  With only blocks and tape
NO NOT TIMEOUT!!! 😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🥵😳😳🥵😳🥶🥶🥵🥵🤬😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬 YOU STELL MY DORA PHONE!!!! 😡😡😡😡😭😭😭😭😭😠😡😡😡😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Why are you talking about summer when it’s literally Christmas Eve?😂😂

What's wrong guns well everything
Can I play pretend Halo?
Hi

oooooh can't wait for part 2.... illy... part 2
I WON'T GO BACK TO TIME OUT
Meanwhile, 3rd grade me is over here telling the teacher when someone wears a hat inside (we weren’t allowed to at my elementary school)
I will not be subtle I noticed koro sensei in the background and loved it also made so much sense koro sensei is a teacher.
pewpew
I see a lot of Pokémon
I love the bakugou and midoriya drawing
I BETTER NOT BE THE ALONE ONE WHO REALISES THERE 2 CHARACTERS FROM HUNTER X HUNTER ( gon and the girl wearing a suit) AND SOUL FROM SOUL EATER ( i think the kid that has pink hair is from a anime)
MayI play video game guns? I like video game guns miss Ily!
Im gonna play pretend guns
ok
Why do I relate so hard to Devon
The only toy guns my family ever got me was when I was like, 18, and they knew how I felt about guns (disgusted), yet my sister and my dad got one too. And every so often, we take out toy gun, shoot the person when they don't notice, and run for out lives because if my dad was pulled into it, he would end you
Happy holding and happy new years illymation 🥳🥳
As a preschool teacher this was prefect
Dangggggggg that's the most inthusiastic  class👌
Illy, I'm a child that plays with gun, PLEASE DON'T SEND ME TO TIME-OUT AHHHHH
Happy Holidays everyone! I hope you all have a great day 💖
Koro-Sensei head :)
I wish I got hugged more. Hello? Is anybody there?
Maybe the kid who's concerned about plastic pollution should work at a plastic recycling place when he grows up. I currently work in a Q.C. lab for a recycling factory.
Merry Christmas 🎄
This is the earliest I have ever been
I worked an afterschool program and it was the worst job of my life
I studied to be an elementary teacher and it is the most wholesome job. The kids never get me frustrated or even mad most of the issues you can encounter are more likely to be with coworkers that are really mediocre or inconsiderate towards the children or karen parents.
All the references I could find lol, There was a lot 0:05 Gon (HxH), Canary (HxH), Soul Evans (Soul Eater), that pink haired guy who's name I forgot, and I think Abnormal Chaos  0:13 The Korosensei Calendar in the background (Assassination Classroom)  0:22 Haikyuu Picture in the Background, (With background artist, iumba_) 0:31 Plushie of the Storyboard Artist, Abnormal Chaos 0:36 Soma (Food wars) 0:48 Pokemon Wallpaper 0:51 The Plushies in the background, Naruto, Korosensei, Hawks (Mha), All Might (Mha) 0:53 Books, Nen (HxH), Jutsu  (I think it's Naruto), Death Note (Death Note) 1:09 Korosensei taking a pictire of Nagisa (Assassination Classroom) 1:13 Stickers, Attack on Titan, Demon Slayer, Naruto, and I think Legend of Zelda 1:22 Karasuno Fly (Haikyuu) 3:41 Youtubers and Shrek (The AMaazing and the other person who's name I can't remember [I'm sorry]) 4:19 Pictures posted on the posting thing, Touya and Hawks, Mirko, Bakugou and Deku (All from MHA) 4:38 Volleyball Stickers on the back of the computer (Haikyuu) After this I got lazy and just skimmed through the video lol, couldn't find any more references that I hadn't stated before  Edit: The edits were adding in the People who helped on the video, and correcting more references
One day when I was in preschool I was talking with my friends and I siad "I hate boy's " and from all the way across the room the teacher looked at me and my friends and siad this "no you don't", and in my four year old mind im thinking how did she hear us, and that my rant about preschool.
I love luigi dancing
no pretend guns you say? Ok I won’t pick the mortal kombat characters with guns.
Did nobody notice the all might plushie?
5:17 i knew you were going to call her the K word!
This is my FAVORITE video of yours! :O  The Karen is drawn PERFECTLY! Along with this your art skills in this video are AMAZING! I love this video and it is a MASTERPIECE!   You are EASILY in my top 3 favorite YouTubers! This is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!  You and your content is INCREDIBLY underrated and I hope you go far in your YouTube content.   I hope you go far on YouTube and I really hope you are very successful!
Why does beau mom look like a karen
My mind plays tricks on me every time I see you sometimes but it’s not you i’m always confused😞
“So your almost an adult.”  That was the sickest burn. Children are monsters, yeah?
I wont play pretend guns :(      Ill just have to use real guns and pertend to kill my friends
I don’t have the patience to deal with small children
I love how you just add every anime I love it 😍😆❤️
Another amazing video! I love your videos because they have a great replay factor, you put in so many details, have excellent comedic timing, and your art style is fantastic! Much love and merry Christmas xoxo
The dislikes are Karen and her kids
1:21 he chilling
cool
Looks like I'm going to timeout :'(
I can still go to time out? At age 23? XD OK THEN I won’t play pretend to “water” guns
Im barely early, but, I love your vids! I wish I could meet you in person but my family loves out of the states and i've never gone to vidcon or to the states. I love your humor and your stories. I love your vids so much! - A fellow fan.
Me: * does finger guns * Illy: GET OVER HERE Me: YOU CAN'T CATCH ME!!! Illy: * handcuffs Me *
Aww man. I wanted to hear more! But its okay, I still enjoyed it. But same! i work in a daycare too. Delilah looks exactly like this one child who is super sweet and has a bouncy personality :) Her name is Devyn though
It looks so clean and crisp.
I used to go to an after school thing and there was one time where one of our friends got mad and started to try and stab us with a ball pump and it got into a full on chase. Two of my friends went off to another area of the playground because they were getting targeted, I was by myself. Later they came back, with him to follow, and we ran up the play structure, and my ankle got grassed with the ball pump needle. After that me and one of my friends, who was the closest person to the kid with the ball pump, ran to the school building that we weren't able to get into before because there's a gate that the after school teacher just opened. So we get past the gate but the kid with the ball pump still gets through the gate, with the teacher close to follow, and I yell that we have to hide, I hide behind a bookshelf and cover myself with bean bags, while my friend goes into a corner behind some tables, but then ball pump kid comes in, and then he JUMPS ON THE TABLE to face my friend, then the teacher comes in, grabs the ball pump kid's attention and then we run into the school's cafeteria. For a while me and my friend were just sitting there alone in the seating area, he was crying, I was processing what had happened, then the teacher comes in with the kid, without his ball pump, and then the school secretary comes in to deal with him. Me, my friend, and the teacher sit there, and the teacher calls my fiends mom to talk to him.  After this you might be wondering why this kid was trying to stab us. The answer is that he stole my friends had, and was kicking it around in the dirt, and we successfully stole it back from him because it was our friend's hat. This was in forth grade, and later the ball pump kid acted like everything was normal and fine. We gradually stopped hanging out with him.
1:40 I have no more problems with the help of, *Best Home Jobs Club*
*Pew* * Pew*
I worked with kids at that age too.👩‍🏫  Also interesting fact!!!!!⚠️ It's illegal for a teacher in Florida to give a kid timeout anymore!!!!!!😧 A Karen probably made this law. 😒

I love how Emily, Wolfy, and now Illyssa have all been teachers at one point. (IDK how old Emily or Wolfy were when they had their teaching jobs, but it would kind of funny if they were also 19 at that time).
Later his mom comes in, and ill call himmm......KAREN   me:...oh...no....

Are you going to hide anime characters in every video from now on?😅
Im going to go work at a camp I used to go to for girl scouts and this is going to be fun... yay
This is the earliest I’ve ever been!  Edit: I’d delete this comment but I got a reply from the creator herself so this comment is sacred
oh no 🔫👦🏼.     👮🏼‍♂️
Bro, Is that an almight toy in that toy bin? I wish that was my after school center, Like dang
*"No....."* _"Yeah!"_ *"NO!!!"* _"YEAH!!!"_
Yo watch these kids are going to become leaders especially that Devin kid with that pollution definitely POTUS material  Idk about that Bo kid tho, but he has the same chances as everybody to be great
Bonny is over here going "The south shall rise again!"
Illy, Why did you get Luigi and not a normal cat? Please reply!! :<
Wait why are we talking about summer in winter...?
I’ll only play guns to get my hunting license
I'm a Pre-K teacher (4 and 5 year olds) and I adore my job. I have the best job on earth. There are parents that can make your life miserable, but the hugs at 7am and the joy of working with kids makes it all worth it ♡
Merry Christmas Eve🎄🎀🎁🌠

But like playing pretend guns :(
I worked at a all Mandarin  speaking preschool with my Chinese friends , but I couldn’t talk to the kids since I can’t speak their language, but the kids also knew English! I am 4’11 and the little boys kept calling me short and laughed at me! The boys were very fun to hang out with though, then I heard the girls gossiping. I asked them what they were doing and they just looked at me then started talking in Chinese 😭
Illy, what do you want for Christmas?
She still has all of these anime and other Easter eggs I love it so fricken much

So I see you come to our side
My parents are teachers and deal with difficult parent all the time but they have never had a kid playing with guns problem.
Yes ma’am
I remember that I had a really nice after school teacher when I was in kindergarten.  She was always really sweet and also I think I was her favorite  :). Mostly because I wasn’t crazy like all the other kids,  and I really hope she’s doing well right now

Hi Illy, Merry Christmas from the Philippines. Your an amazing animator and it seems you work really hard. Hopefully you can see your family. -Love SSG
EARLYYY
nagisa getting a photo with goofy
Hi
i dont wanna time outed
An R2-D2 47 or something, lol that is halarious
I had to take a 1and a half month course to actually be able to legally use a gun for hunting. I'm thirteen this was a year ago, so the fact the kid Boe was playing guns is insane because that means that his mom at some point told him about guns and used guns in front of him. His mom probably did not have a license  which is required for the use of a gun plus this also means based on the description of how he played with the "gun" means that the gun the mom used must have been an automatic to semi automatic weapon which are mainly used as assault weapons. Which are illegal in some states. And these guns amuniton are normally lead which are normally illegal to use in most states. Hence forth she can be arrested and have the child taken away from her custody.
Um, you dont have a cat named luigi. You have a cat named luWEEgi

the south yee haw
the upbeat song is really good
I was that kid in the Corner eating Play-do. I didn’t have much friends. I remember a kid throw a wood chip and it hit my eye. He got sent to time out. He gave my that dirty look. He was in time out and I got attention. I felt proud while crying.
Merry almost Christmas hope everyone gets some nice tasty wall chicken
All the little assassination classroom references got me- 😭
“Dont play pretend guns or I WILL send you to timeout”    Oh noes! Not the....TIME OUT! I cant go back there!!! Quick, Billy, hide the blocks!

It’s always the Karens that ruin everything.

Hmm, I wonder how the situation would have gone if the kid was playing Cops and Robbers?
Did you know I graduated top in my nen class and mastered ken by myself. I have defeated Bisky in battle, and have mastered a forbidden power more powerful then gon's.
Hey she called the Karen Karen and I am dying right now
As soon as I saw the mom's hair, I knew she'd be called Karen
If they send we to time out when playing with guns, my friends would be expelled forever
What if I play pretend knife?
happy holidays
Let's make this a game where you can spot all the anime references
*Me playing pretend guns* Uh oh...
I'm 37'738 😂😂😂

Illy: Having food wars in a kids classroom   Me: *the flashbacks are beginning*
Omg the anime references is ✨OUT OF THIS WORLD✨
Do watch Mha?     I saw mha photos   Or do you watch Haikyu!!
@illymation Merry Christmas!! Your animations are getting better with every video. You're so talented and creative and I love all the cute references and details you've been adding in your amazing backgrounds. Thank you so much for putting all this hard work and effort into these!! I hope you get your own tv show one day if that's something you want to do!!
Fine I’ll just hav euro play REAL home invasion
4:39 there is my hero acidemia pictures
As someone who’s worked in childcare for many years, I truly appreciate this video. There’s literally no other job like it... in the best and worst way possible 😂
Cool
Dam usually I was told guns and school mix pretty good lol
Illy: what is the most evil thing in the world? Devin: ...PlAsTic
Ummm Alyssa the boy you said was Devon I am pretty sure I know him in real life and he is way more worse than you think And I know because Well he went to my school
Why the hell was there an assassination classroom reference in this video about a classroom filled with little kids
Im proud of devon
My name is illy and I worked at hell
The Fortnite kids must go to beeg kid time out
one time a kid got arrested for pointing a finger gun at a car. like he got handcuffed and put in jail. he got let out, and apparently he was just pretending to be someone in fortnite.
"How old are you?" "19" "oH" Ily: "... and i took that personally"
Yay a post! I'm early!😹
The mother was definitely out of line there. Even as someone who supports the second amendment. A kid shouldn't be doing stuff like that... people like that just make me cringe smh
e
Ok imma go back to playing pretend guns 🔫
Hes gonna be a theater major
Omg soul w. A cameo as a lil student 😍
Puw puw I have gun
THE AMOUNT OF REFERENCES IN THIS VIDEO IS INSANE
Is it bad playing with Netflix guns

Koro-sensei!!
Illy: don't play pretend guns  Me:*picks up a fake gun* haha rules go dead. pew pew

Have A Safe And Jolly Christmas Everyone. 💚🎄❤
Video: been up for 30 minutes: Comments: HEYYYYYYY HOW YA DOIN
YESSSS SEND ME TO TIME OUT DADDY
why do all the younger children say stuff in unison? "thaank youuu" "hi mrs. ______" it's freaky
I feel bad for Bo for having a mom like that....
she said we shouldn't play with pretend guns at the end, but she never gave me any restriction on real ones >:D
who wants to play pretend guns 🔫😎 ms ilyssa wont know 🔫🔫🔫🔫
This is an old joke but    VECTOR
"How old are you?" "Im 19" "Oh so your almost an adult" *Ded inside*
Karen aleart
The all might and Naruto teddies in the background got me XD (≧▽≦)
There should be a documentary about wildlife, but instead of animals there are a bunch of Karens
Devan is an amazing kid for caring so much about his earth. He should be an activist when he grows up-he's one smart kid. Also, this is the best Christmas present, an animation/
I don't pretend play guns i do
Yeyy I’m early for once!!
kids can be adorable and terrifying at th same time Same goes with their parents
Is that a koro-sensei i see?
Merry Xmas illy
I love the little assassination classroom easter eggs
nobody: Teacher: why do you Eat from the floor? Everyone in the classroom: 5 SECOND RULEEEE
i play factorio and pollution is a problem. i'm 11 (and i want the right to not lie about my age to still have a google account, my first one was deleted because i changed my registered birthdate to my actual birth date) (maybe at least include a "welcome to google, we saw your registered birth date shows you're a kid, so we're going to show you some (not all, as some rules can't be shown to kids) of the rules of the internet!" (maybe also not target their ads from data too because coppa (i mean, i don't care if my data is shown to people, but other kids (or their parents) might not)) "happy searching!" thing, google? ok.)
Someone recently watched my hero academia.

That Mother of the child is also the mother of Karen’s
me:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
7:24 too Late sorry
As much as I would like to roll my eyes over the notion of the whole toy gun issue and throw my 2 cents in explaining how I played with toy guns as a child and be a complete fool, I completely agree 100% that a child having the imagination of pretending to shoot a gun is worrying. After all the terrible things that have transpired in our school systems and outside of them, your action in informing your supervisor was so responsible. And the way you dealt with Karen was amazing, keep up the awesome work and thank you!
The level of maturity between an adult and a child isn't that big when you see things like what happened with Karen.
my favourite experience was working at a summer camp and having to send away a mother because she was basicly stalking her child en disrupting class XD (had to get my supervisor for this one haha)
Thanks for reminding me i'm old as dirt and i'll never get the childhood i stupidly thought would last forever XD
“Maybe Disneyland”...  Me: *Laughs in Cast Member*
bro i woulda drop kicked the kids if they annoying bro i have  such a low tolerance
3:28 so he's a gamer POG!!!

This comment is of topic but              I love the drumming sounds in the background

Merry Christmas eve to all who is watching this video
6:33 Yelling at your younger siblings for doing something annoying then your mom walks in

Illy: "just talking" Luigi: yeeeeeeeeeah babyyy welcome to the funk town
Marry Christmas
Pew pew
Yo these kids were blessed by the Holy Spirit
*plays with fake guns*
KOROSENSEI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love how "Mrs. Sheriff" and you would gossip, idk I just found that really funny
One time, I was dealing with a Karen on the phone and after arguing some time I put her  on hold to talk to my manager. They answered my question but were busy so I went back to the phone. The Karen assumed I was the manager. I didn't bother correcting her and altered the pitch of my voice slightly. her entire attitude changed to more positive and listened to what I had to say(the same thing i was telling her earlier). It's crazy how they flip the switch like that. Like I was somehow so much better and important and intelligent because I was a "manager". Dont get me wrong, managers have a hard job and special training and more experience usually but that doesn't mean the average employee is too dumb to help you with your problem, Karen. We certainly know more about how the store works than you do, Karen.
* notices koro-sensie and all might on the shelfs *  I HAVE BEN SUMMONED!
Hello, im *early*.
You think being a summer school teachers bed when I went to a summer school in 6th grade I have to go to a kid academy full of 4 year old kids I wasn't oldest kid in the class. It was me, my younger sister, and a whole bunch of reckless kids. I was 12 years old in that hell hole, you have  NO IDEA how terrible it was. My Mom forced me to go, but my Dad thought otherwise and I don't blame him, like I said I was the oldest kid at the time and those little kids were mean. I usually sleep whenever I'm in the place and it often works. The teachers there were nice thought they made me watch over the kids and made me a teacher it was okay I guess. Like or Comment if you felt the same way I felt when I dealt with that hell hole
I am also 19....almost an adult...damn.
When you introduced no I got scared because I used to be obsessed with the clone wars.
You know I love the new art style but I liked the old nose more but it’s fine if illy doesn’t change it  happy holidays
wow  the amount anime references
Hi! I love your videos!
When I was a kid, 50% of children made guns out of Duplo at my primary school (UK kindergarten) all the time and the teachers never said a word about it and this was in 2006
Good thing my guns are in kill animations.
The kids seem really good. Even Bo, since he’s clearly just a victim of his circumstances, judging from his mother.
I remember being taunted in preschool by others saying i liked the color pink. The fact is, i actually liked pink... It's my 4th favorite (after Green, Purple and Blue). But man, they made me think i disliked it during those days.
Why does Devin look like he would be Illy's little brother?
I loved this.
New challenge: find every anime easter egg thing in this video.
“ _What’s wrong with guns_ “  *every frickin thing*
Oof
I love your videos. You are so beautiful. Keep up the good work. 😄
*Plays pretend guns*  You shall never send me to timeout
*Vibes with cat*
Animation teacher and drawing teacher
Okay. Like on one hand Karen can go step on a LEGO and the extent of how the kid was acting was extreme, at the same time (In my experience) young boys in school often are told to be themselves, but are then punished for being themselves because who they are and the kind of person they want to be doesn't align with the ideals of the almost entirely female staff. Yeah him constantly wanting to play guns was probably influenced by Karen, but also just him being a boy. I'm not trying to say that his or his mother's behavior is acceptable, but just that there are always 2 sides to the story. I wanted to shed some light on the other side, having been a 6 year old boy myself.
4:47 KORO SENSEI IN THE BACK!!!!
Her : “I’m not tall enough to be other than a chipmunk”   Me : I feel ya
love ur videos :D
Don’t send me to time out!!
"Don't play pretend guns or I will send you to timeout!"  MEANWHILE 6/7 year olds be playing Fortnite on their dads iPad....

Merry Christmas everyone!

1:09 NAGISA, KORO-SENSEI 4:58 NARUTO ALL MIGHT KORO-SENEI HAWKS
🔫😏 *bang*
I also volunteered with kids when I was 19. My experience however... did not go so well. Mostly because I was A: Dyspraxic and still learning alot of social cues. B: Was constantly undermined by the teachers every time I tried to see what kids might be bickering about. I'm glad it worked out for you, Ily! But for me, I'm sticking to animals. Many fewer worries about customer service there :P.
I just finished my rewatch of Assassination classroom so seeing everyone from it on this video from on of my favorite youtubers warmed my heart more then I can describe :D
I wanna join that class bc u literally have Pokemon and Naruto in the same classroom

so sad she isn't tall enough to be nagisa from assassination classroom
Illy: And we'll call her- Me: Omgshelookslikeakarencallherkaren!!!! Illy: *K A R E N.* Me: **surprised pikachu face**
Me sees Karen my black ness go: reeeeeeeerahhhhhhhhh
I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF THIS QWQ✨✨✨💖💖💖
We all need to be more like devin
As someone who helps at a daycare, this is accurate.
**anime characters just vibing in the patch of kids**
NOOOO DON'T SEND ME TO TIMEOUT!
Why is Bo 100% my grandma-  Like, I kid you not, I posted one of my drawings on Facebook and all she had to say was “where’s her gun”
Luigi would make an excellent teacher.

If you have to teach my class it would be actual hell
Amazing video I loved it tysm
Merry christmas!!
This right here is why I don't want to become a teacher, even though I'm pretty sure I'd be good at it otherwise.
Merry Christmas illy we love you ❤️❤️❤️❤️

Merry Christmas eve
Merry chrismahanakwanza everyone!
My mom works as a teacher and this is legit

I freaking can’t with the anime references/drawings they are my new favorite things
Dude you are awesome I love you and you love me

You have so many crazy adventures 😅
illymation illymation illymation lets see if it works!
"I'm not first" "I'm not last" "But most importantly..." NOBODY ASKED
Soul, Gon, Naruto, All Might, Yuji, Sōma and Koro-sensei in the first 20 seconds nice. Nagisa and Hawks too.
Kid: How old are you? Illy: 19 Kid: Oh so your almost an adult Destruction 100
My cousin (he is about 7/8)makes my other cousins (they are like 5) play "poor" and when they play pretend he pretends to be drunk or high or a robber.I think he needs a therapist.
When I was 5, me, my brother and friends always used to play war. And we got waaaayyyy into character, I remember my friends putting a rag on my face and pouring water on it (water boarding) to get me to tell them info
✨ So many anime references ✨
I’m all for 2A🇺🇸 BUT as a parent you should teach your child to do that stuff in public it is intolerable.
7:25 try me!!!!!!!!!!! * grabs pretend gun* aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!
my notification just 'had' to be 4 minutes late when its my favorite youtuber
Merry Christmas Eve guys!! 🎅🎅🎄🎄
Subtle abnormal chaos plush
I think the mother is an idiot and obviously only yelled at you because she probably knew she could get away with it.
WAIT IM LITERALLY FREAKED OUT YOUR NAME AND DESCRIPTION OF THE TEACHERS FIT MY OLD DAYCARE SO MUCH BACK IN TEXAS. AAAA
Time out, aka the afterlife
Kids who play with pretend guns go to time out me and my friends with are M1 Garands lookin to storm Iwo Jima
At 2:21, I swear I thought he was gonna say "do you know the muffin man?" 🤣
Illy: the first one I'll talk about is Delaney! Me: how does she know me?!?!
Mental note: do not play guns when illymation is close
I would make a joke about being early, but i'm not creative

NEW VID
Fat Cat Money
Happy holidays and/or happy new years :)
Yay Illy is back <3!
Hope you all have a merry Christmas
Haha I have a gun pew pew haha
Hello.
Cool
Danggggg Devin was woke af
I always tell my family I can’t imagine being a teacher. 😅 I always say this because I’m an impatient person and I saw how my class acts with subs🤣😂
I feel sorry for beau.
What happens if I play with nerf guns ?
Happy Christmas, Merry Hanukkah, Merry Holidays.
I can't with the amount of anime references, I love them sm
But can I play pretend lightsabers?
I sooo wish u were my after school teacher
Luigi’s dance though
The kids in the beginning sound so sad
Illy you won’t send me to time out nah not 🔫👦🏻
Yeah..gun pretend should rlly wait until you're old enough to ride a bike lmao
I am HERE for all the anime references
I don’t like time out. ;-;
TO THIS IS FRESH ONLY 11 MINS?!   That's the earliest I've ever been
Kids repeat what they see at home. There should be a test to pass before having children, like "failed exam, guns are not toys, you are not allowed to have a kid".
Happy holidays to everyone and a happy new year
Me: plays pretend gun Any Illy in a 500,000 mile radius: *t i m e o u t f o r y o u l i t t l e b o y*
People like Karen are why people like Kyle Rittenhouse are created.
Early merry Christmas
At 5:40 omg that remained me a case when one of my kid that work was allergic to nuts, so come a birthday of one of his classmates and she give everyone a chocolate coins me and the person check if it is Okey (like size wise) but also ask her if nuts in it she said they have chaked with the kid mom (that aglic to nuts) that she aprrove. But come luch time and the kid (that aglic to nuts) his belly start hurting him so bad he started to cry, and I sit by him and was like maybe go to the restroom (it talk him five min) mainwhlie the person ask what you think is happening to him, we call his mom (just let her know)  and  than sandly I rember that it all started after he eat the chocolate coin so I googled the company and would believe it says that it might be having nuts there. So I told person with me and we call his mom immediate she say: "oh yay but you see he eats them everyday in Hanukkah (holiday) and *there's nothing worng*" well the person who work me and I like freaking out (turn out that person, her sister have really bad  nuts algic as well) so I am like why we should need to tell that her child maybe need to eat like 100% nuts free food
So.. as long as it's not a pretend, I'm good right? Right??
Dont worry I wont play guns 👍🏿
you cant tell me what to do (Plays pretend guns)
All of the assassination classroom references is making me melt omg I live for this
I used to go to a daycare when i was 10 i think and boy did things get weird i was the helper of the techer and the daycare for the toddlers,afterschoolers, and baby room so i was mostly in the after schoolers and boy the freaking students used to asked disgusting things

Sup early squad
OH MY GOSH GURL,  I FEEL YOU.  I worked at a daycare for 3 years, and there were kids I adored, and others... Not so much.  But the parents were definitely the worst part of it, because you know that they're the ones responsible for how their kids are acting. There was one child I didn't exactly care for, but looking at how his father acted,  I felt for bad him :/ It's definitely not an easy job!
Drinking game: take a shot every time you see an anime reference
Imagine kids playing Dungeons & Dragons
Like if it’s Christmas Eve for you! Merry Christmas!
Hell yeah! Fuck Plastic littering! Less straws and plastic ware.

"Let's call her Karen."   Oh we know where this going.
Parents: dont looks at the comments The comments: Happy Holidays! 00:00 [joke]. Hey thats relatable!
Turtle.
I love all the anime references lol also I love ur vids
She is right Karen is a good fit for that kids moms name. Also how did people her age think globe warming was a MYTHE!
Sooooo many my hero academia Easter eggs!
The south and guns man. They go hand and hand. I’m from the south so I can say this. 😂
This got me thinking of how I wanted the job of being a camp counselor at my old summer camp. It was a Christian summer camp where we talked about god at times, but it was fun. It’s split up into four programs, ranging from the youngest kids, to the oldest teenagers, so if I were to be a camp counselor there it could teach me whether or not I’m better with kids or teenagers around my age. I went there in the two oldest programs, and after I was done I thought ‘maybe I should give it a try’ but COVID hit and the camp was canceled. If I were to get the chance again, I would try to have a job here just for one summer just so I can get the feel for it
me encantan tus animaciones
dont play guns kids ;3 bc if you do, you better watch out illy be commin to put u in timeout o-o
0:26 if Illy says she was on a volley ball team I swear-    (For those who don't understand, look at the background. They're wearing the volleyball uniform from Haikyuu in the picture frame)

This is fun :3 I am early    I wish I was a 6 years old with illy because she is the coolest   Edit: I Devin but traumatized lol
I used to play pretend Gun and look how I turned out. A nervous wreck, anxiety ridden, Middle school child.
Bigggggg off QwQ And in Isreal we have a game that literally it’s with your fingers and you basically go in sink with everyone and you point behind you as “reload” put you arms in an X position on your chest as “shield” and the do gun fingers as in “shoot” and you need to get the person while they are reloading or something.. I’m gonna guess I’m going to time out for playing a gun game.. Oof-
"Later,his mom enters the story and i'll call her..." KAREN! KAREN! KAREN! "Karen" YEAHHHHH
I don’t want to go to time out
What about my bi finger guns?
But what if we use nerf guns
I love the vid when she was talking about Luigi

Hi, I love your videos. They always make me laugh 🧡
That story had my jaw dropped
Me now takes a screenshot of every my hero academia thing there
Jokes on you I'm 13 and ik every thing happening so I'm paranoid
I was bo when I was a kid I loved guns since I played a lot of video games and just was running and shooting zombies. I mean it was great for my imagination and never really did anything in public such as school or Walmart. Just  in my backyard with my cousins
Delaine is soooo wholesome! I wish I was like that in the 1st grade, but I was too busy being an “edgy” and “tough” child.
*what do you want to be when you grow up?*  Delany: I want to be a teacher to make kids happy!!   Devin: I want to be lawyer to stop green house gases!               *Bo:I want to be a murder to play with guns >:3*
These kids sound so sweet <3 good job doing this!
Me watching this when my nerf gun is right next to me
How I became a wobber at the age of six. Pew pew pew 🔫
But my hobby is based around modding nerf blasters.....
Karen alert karen alert
Happy holidays
In preschool I once brought in a toy gun for show a tell and when I brought it up she did not get mad she just told me not to do it again ( also I shot a kid while I was waiting and told on me but the teachers did not hear him)
🔫🔫🔫💪
4:21 I see my hero academia I love it
pew pew gun noises
I really love how you talked about this. I just finished at a preschool and I honestly miss it because of covid but this video made me super happy😊💕
In my old school you couldn’t play or imagine using guns but lazar guns are fine
MERRY CHRISTMAS AND HAPPY HANUKKAH
The is bow and his famliy

My neighbors name is Delaney She’s in my school *but she is not a bundle of sunshine*
Oh this block I will pretend that this is a gun and pretend that I killed my friends with it
So you're almost an adult  Kids are weirdly brutal
Happy holidays and a happy new year

This is an early Christmas present for me...
I remember working with kids it was a fun and terrifying job...

Delaney is what I try to be, but I don't succeed LOL
Why are all the toys în the background from anime like all might, naruto , hawks ,pokemon, deku and bakugo and that guy from food wars,  i don't know his name Edit:Now I watch Food Wars and I know that his name is Soma
Illy: Let's call this woman Karen. Me: **immediately understands why**
Pollution: *exists*  Devin: Peace was never an option.
but my dad said 18 is an adult
You’re animation somehow gets better every video-
Can you make a video about Animal Crossing New Horizons?
Merry early Christmas!
Dude I can named some of the anime stuff included in this assassination classroom, naruto, and my hero academia
Weird I just realize something you and your YouTube friends or at least some of your friends were teachers / worked with little children
Ah yes the R2D2 47 my favorite type of gun

This story is so sweet.
Sees korosensei  me:  depression
It’s wensday
Pew pew 🔫
I have also worked as an after school teacher and one of the most memorable moments of my 'career' was when all the kids started to play this game called 'pizzaria'. Sounds pretty innnocent right? Wrong! The game involved throwing each other as hard as possible on the ground and 'putting toppings on each others heads' AKA throwing dirt and stones
Early and awesome animation! Have a good Christmas
Omg i saw all might in the corner!
I WAS JUST WISHING FOR AN ANIMATED VIDEO TO COME OUT
I loved all of the haikyuu, MHA, and naruto merch in the back XD
It’s only been 11 mins and a lot of views dang

Pew pew pretend guns 🔫🔫🔫
Devin: “Do you what the most evil thing in the world is?” Ilyssa: *thinks of every bad and horrific thing in the world* Devin: “PLASTIC”
