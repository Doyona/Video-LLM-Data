People that dont know the song, its a mix of her style and dutch rap style beats songs made together with dutch rapper U-niq. ANDDD YEAAHHH she is part dutch, her roots is Jamaican and born in Birmingham but when she was 4 yrs old she moved with her sister and brother DUTCHavelli she lived in netherlands Rotterdam for 10 a 12 years like that then got back to london. These beats are more dutch what we use

I love it, it sounds amazing and looks gorgeous, but realize that all these females are constantly offering themselves up to the male gaze and dream of possession, and male stars never do anything even remotely like that. I wish they would, though.
i have listened and sang along to this song soooo many times that i know all the words by heart already 😍😍 what a bop

FIRE
26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:  27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves the recompence of their error which was meet. 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;   -HOLY BIBLE
Big up QUEENIE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If she had minded her business, her career would have fudged ahead, but that's the problem of jumping on every trend you see. BARBS really put her career in a coma (bitter truth).  Lesson:  Mind your business no matter what.

Yo is it just me or did this song completely steal the from the instrumental of Medusa by Jhay Cortez ?!
0,47 min I know she lived in Holland but is she really throwing a Dutch line in this verse “ik weet niet wat je denkt”
But the beat is Medusa from anuel aa and j balvin!
So I see the little sister also in the video. They look so much a like imagine the dude who comes to ask for marriage. People would think him a baffoon bcause his head would be whipping from one girl to the other like which one did I say I want again?????

At this point, a lot of people, traders and investors alike are slipping into despair with the consistent pullback and pull ups in price but all signs actually point to the beginning of a strong uptrend. The only possible drawback may be that the halving cycle is lengthening, nevertheless, the asset is still poised for $16 000 meaning, this may be the lowest price to ever purchase btc again. Emphasis must be placed on accumulation and I have my fair share already not by just buying bitcoins but also trading actively, with help of Aische Adolph through her signals service which saw me making over 8 btc in profit within my first month of meeting her. You all can reach out to her through TELEGRAM and WHATSAPP +14752351338.
Love her 💕🥰💚

The new queen in the game . After the last single, " move "comes to confirm ur place as the queen of the game.
She is not chubby like before ! She Had such beautiful body before 😒😒😔
please stop saying Stefflon Don wants to be like Nicki Minaj, don’t be dense. Stefflon is Jamaican and her music has ALWAYS had a Jamaican vibe to it. Nicki Minaj is Trinidadian, they’re similar but not the same.
"Can't chat to me with those views" Is she talking to Miss Lafamillia🤔🤔
0:48 low key looks like Lola from shark tale
She smashed dis riddim.  🔥🔥🔥

@ michelle  king it said in the article steve and mikaella  are bleaching & lightning their skin .However they deny it saying they have a skin condition .But they dont even look black anymore from using this lotion they look mixed race https://matsuiskinlightening.com/products/1-best-seller-extra-strength-orange-peeling-lotion-100-ml evidently this is the same lotion hollywood celebrities use to lighten their skin like many shades lighter.If they had some skin disorder then why do they look like mixed race now and not black?what skin disorder lightens your skin so much like this ? people should be upfront and honest not pretending that their skin is naturally so light.
This thing of saying Don wanna be Nicki it's crazy to me this girl is doing her own thing and it's 🔥 bruhv🍒
THIS SOUNDS LIKE MEDUSA BY ANUEL 🧐
14sec in its confirmed Banger🔥🔥🔥 don em

Hi everyone I'm Olivia Linda and am here to share the wonderful testimony for the good work Dr vera did for me. After 5 years in marriage with my lover with 2 kids, my lover started acting weird and going out with other ladies and showed me cold love, on several occasions he threatens to divorce me if I dare question him about his affair with other ladies, I was totally devastated and confused until a old friend of mine told me about a spell caster on the internet called Dr. vera who help people with relationship and marriage problem by the powers of love spells, at first I doubted if such thing ever exists but decided to give it a try, when I contact her, she helped me cast a love spell and within 11hours my lover came back to me and started apologizing, now he has stopped going out with other ladies and his with me for good and for real. Contact this great love spell caster for your relationship or marriage problem to be solved today Whats-app him: +2348051759674 OR Email via verasegispells@gmail.com

My herpes is cured and it's miracle healing. Thanks to Dr. Bali who cure my Genital #Herpes I was in trouble when doctor told me that I have been diagnosed with Genital Herpes. I thought about my Family, how they will feel if they knew, i was also felling pains in my Anus and vagina. I lost hope and I wept all day, but one day I was surfing the internet I found about Dr. Bali on how he cured a lady with natural herbs, I decided to contact him through his mobile number, i also wrote him letter through his email address. he guided me. I asked him for solutions and he prepared a herbal remedy and send to me,when i received it, i started taking it as directed. Thank God, now everything is fine, I’m cured by Dr. Bali herbal medicine, I’m very thankful to God and very happy with my wife and family. You can contact him through his email address ondrbalihome@gmail.comTel/Whats-App: +2348120933032  doctor page https://drbalisolutioncenter.jimdofree.com

💎💎💎🔥🔥🔥
Gross.  Dark energy ...
🔥🔥☄️💥🇯🇲🇯🇲
Theres a formula that works for Stefflon Don and she doesn't seem to be following it with each song going further and further away from the formula. The Secure Mixtape was the best songs she's released and she just ignored the project and moved on. "Uber" should of been a single that song sounds so good and makes you feel a mood. It was soul, the song was honest and it wasn't forced it was a terrific theme but she goes from songs like that to this. Although this is an amazing song. Stefflon Don fans were hoping for something much more jaw dropping for her return!
Needed some Steff in my life
💥💥💥💥💥💥
