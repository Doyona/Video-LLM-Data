14:07 the laugh😂😂😂😂😂
You know what King Kenny Should have done. He should have called in Leon Willis to help him train  to beat Ashley Rak su 💯 other wise King Kenny would get the W easy. So it wouldn’t have to be his mistake.
13:22 funny asf😂
walid sharks is on the card
Kenny shouldnt of won any of his fughts not surprised
Kenny pulled a deji vs wassabi
Who does JMX trains with? I hope he gets to perform smoothly
Watching the fight nich deffo landed more but jay hurt him wayyy more and had the bigger moments
Kenny needs to stfu
Kenny fights like the beta squad are the judges - Viddal Riley 🤣😂  That's a violation bro. I'm sure Daley and the team know which adjustments to make for the next one as the brothers have said
Mcbroom isn't confirmed yet tbf
8:58
you can tell leon was that kid who was always smiling and laughing. such a good vibe everytime i click on these videos.
Why are we even talking about true gordie No One should give that racist fuck a platform people just acting like he wasn't racist
Kenny should fight Pineda
Lol
Kenny fought Temperr and Sensei, who both beat him easily and we've seen JJ starch and KO both of them (Sensei was in sparring).  He's not good, like at all. He's just long enough to outbox people who don't commit to taking shots.
I always have to increase the volume when ever I'm watching your guys videos. I think there might be a sound issue with your guy's mics 🎤
His biggest weakness was not throwing any punches in a boxing match
That Ginty fight was horrendous, was in the crowd and everyone was booing and then ginty was walking around the place with his top off all night like he banged the guy. Embarrassing.
Both Kenny and deji are not trained well. Both scared to get hit
He doesn't punch enough or set up combos. Saved yall 30 minz.  Just like jake really.
True Geordie vs Bradley Martin!
I dont think the fights gon be entertaining tho if more rounds, because more fighters will start to fight like kenny did and it will get boring
Why do people think Kenny is good. Technique and stance can be learnt. Heart and fighting attitude cannot be taught. Others seem to have more courage than him in the ring. So Kenny actually has the least boxing potential of everyone.
Jay vs ashley rak su would be fun
Jay vs deji is my dream fight
Wait did they skip the ham and ginty fight or did i blank out 🤣
Halal turkey vs ginty was the worst influencer fight to date turkey man knew he was losing and pussied out
Wills is so wrong and talks like he knows everything LMAO
And kennys fighting in the kingpin 🥲
I wanna see Leon fight Idris Virgo on a misfits card because I don't think Leon has the hand speed to make him piss blood 🤔
It sucks cause kennys skill is there
I wish these fights later up the card became 6 rounds lol
Nich came out SURPRISINGLY outclassed jay whos been boxing for years lol
Kenny disappointed me so much here but big up ashley him and nich cemented their names
First deji now kenny im wondering if its just daleys style to preserve energy and play defensive
Dude fought just like deji vs wassabi
Kenny’s performance was similar to Deji’s fight with wasabi which correct me if I’m wrong, but done his training camp with Daley for that fight. Hopefully not a reoccurring thing out of that gym.
Enough with Jay being main lmao
Misfits is the new big thing now
Swingler vs Kenny make it happen!
Vidals hairline going on trip
Top 10 influencer boxers https://youtu.be/JU5rZi3OEM0
🔥🔥🔥
but when you think about it jake has beaten way better opponents than jj, as much as i dislike saying it even if jj beats fournier  when you compare it to anderson silva or tyron woodley 1 and 2,  jj's opponents aren't on the same level. When it comes to jake there was way more fights where you were like "idk who is gonna win". So i don't think a second loss from jake paul to tommy fury would kill off the fight, it could be a fight for JJ to prove that he is capable of being in that ring with tommy fury, if it is promoted in that sense and not as the end goal it will sell way more and will have a lot of hype regardless of the loss's
truegeordie won't fight cause he scared of what will come up at the press conference
kenny is ass and scared…salt papi KILLS him if that’s what kenny’s brother coaches i feel sorry…until he understands he has to get hit to land a couple he will be lackluster…even deji learned this and looked what happened
*Will Kingpyn rival Misfits?* Jake Paul is the only one who could’ve, but besides that no one can. Only way they would compete is if they are paying the fighters 10x more than misfits. But you can’t buy reputation
We need Leon to smoke idris
I love this keep this up giys
Di bowy shook
I need Misfits to up all the rounds for Championship fights. 4 rounds reaaaally isn't enough
Kenny is rubbish.
ham won his first fight in 2018
He should be 0-3 right?
20:42
Been waiting for thissss
Yeah I’ll save myself 30 mins. His mistake was not throwing punches. You can’t win on all defense with no offense
I love this channel bro. Never stop uploading pls.
I feel like kenny should change coach. Exactly the same problem with deji vs wassabi. Its not really a coincidence
Vidal vs tommy fury should be coming up
Brian loses to the 18yr old first round KO. Hence him not fighting
Kenny’s ass he has been saying he can beat everybody n got smoked by someone not near as good as jj salt etc 🤦🏽‍♂️
Mcbroom was cocky and lost that fight because of inexperience if we being honest i don't think a Rematch is Surefire Gibs win
The way I see it, is that Misfits is like the UFC of the influencer boxing space and then stuff like ur Kingpyn is like ur Bellator
problem is i think both tommy and jake can sleep ksi, he is more comfortable with tin tin cans like swarmz and temper, fournier is another 40 year old troll flat footed who stopped fighting long time ago
The duo is sitting here discussing influencer boxing and not traditional boxing. A year or 2 from now, traditional boxing will be completely shadowed by influencers. The skill is not their just yet for most of the fights but the entertainment is their, THE PERSONALITY is their the self promotion is their. Once skill starts seeping in. They will outclass traditional boxing in views and general interest.
Jay vs Kenny would be too shit it’d be a worse version of Kenny’s last fight jay isn’t explosive but looks like he hits hard Kenny’s just gonna jab his face off
Make video on Misfits new signing Samuel Ericsson - Karate Background
26:43 Leon trying rizz me up
Kenny just needs a quick 1 2 and he'd win that easily. Daley is super careful and he should be it's his brother
Why are these guys not commentating or something on misfits ???
Kenny 1-3(ik he technically beat sensei) but looks the part of top 5 in the scene
Yeah I know ginty vs ham was kinda bad, but I do wish both of them back, especially ginty
Vidal telling Geordie he needs to fight but bro haven’t you heard him say he’s made a way in life to earn money without getting brain damage? Vidal starting to slur words already due to be a cabbage when he older
Ngl I think Kenny is one of the most boring fighters in the scene. Dry promotion and dead fighting style (looks great for a 12 round fight but in a 4 round influencer match he needs to throw hands, you can't just sit behind a jab, we wanna see fireworks). Kenny is realistically 1-3. Best fight of the night was Swingler v NichLMAO, good solid fight, equal level and close call. I had Nich winning on the night but having watched it back, I'd call it a draw. First 2 rounds to Nich, last 2 rounds to Jay. Finally that tag team was pure entertainment. I hope they don't do it too much to take away the novelty of it but I loved it way more than I thought I would. Props to Mams! The only thing I can think left to do in this scene is to introduce open scoring because there are some questionable decisions in Misfits at times and there's no better platform to do something that traditional boxing needs and isn't willing to do.
Funny hearing you guys saying Kenny should lower the level in opponent now knowing he’s singed to fight in this kingpyn tournament, imagine he gets Gib 1st 😂
Yeah... I don't think y'all revealed anything other than stated the obvious 😂
I was waiting for this
Kenny’s jab is so overrated, whenever someone applies the smallest of pressure he can’t cope with it and opponents get inside of him so easily. Problem is he just throws a jab to throw the jab, no follows up or anything
1:23 i disagree tbh ill always watch his and then wades analysis over anyone regardless of if he fights
18:50 hit them with that Ariel Helwani shit😂😂
We need Astrid vs Elle Brooks!!
Also Kenny tried to swagger away round 1 right beside his opponent and got smacked hahaha
I think Deji vs Jay swingler needs to happen ONLY because someone is gonna get exposed! They both have misleading Resumes
Leon we HAVE to see you in the ring!!!
5:22 🤣🤣😭
Your right most of the fights need more rounds not just king Kenny's
You guys are real! I didn’t see much credit to Rak Su though and maybe suggest fights for the winners next not just about your boy Kenny, still loved the videos lads
the goats return
True Geordie is on too much steroids to fight
Ril & Wills need to make a debut in the influencer boxing scene as a tag team. This channel would booooom!! Hahah
For his time, he’s decent, but let’s not pretend he’s good, he’s average, he needs more time to get good, and we was exposed
You guys are just cracking me up 😆 🤣 😂
we need more tag team boxing!
Los Pinedas Colodas vs Jay Swingler & Nichlmao has to be next tag team match
At this point Deen is Walid’s brother in law now so Leon is right in saying push the rematch back a bit more and let the family drama boil lolll
Kenny is clearly fundamentally, technically and skillfully gifted. But he just didn't commit on his punches, He didn't follow up on his jab and didn't throw any combination's or barley let his right hand go which was weird. It reminded me of Tyron Woodley and how Woodley refused to be active, This is sad because Kenny has a lot of potential.
I was waiting for this fam
wait lemme get some food brev
First
