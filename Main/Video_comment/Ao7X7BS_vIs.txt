F1 The Movie has this race.
0:29 He really meant that alonso did he ❤
But red bull tsunoda❌Perez✅
Hoping for a wet race tomorrow
Dutch GP: it was Lawson's F1 debut?
5:49 here comes the rain 😂
Sonny hayes drive>>>>
7:30
For those who dont know this race has the highest overtakes in f1 history 186 and also the highest pits stops 89 and also most overtakes in a single lap 63 in lap 3.
Fernando Alonso is the best driver on the grid.
Anyway I have to go to be a leader
that one bro who got dared to go with intermediates the entire race:
Max could've got Pole, if Russell just didnt crash
Carlos sainz is the best
2:43 how is zhou second 🫨
Epic Alonso start, EPIC
In the words of the racist Helmut Marko "Verstapen would get pole even with a HASS..." what's happening now, has he forgotten how to drive?
Who is here after latifi's win in 2026
Alonso should be true winner, 5 second penalty for Verstappen pushing the alpine off.
Al bon and Russell from twitch streams "Geooorrrge!"
POV: You’re missing F1 during the summer break so you came here

Alonso masterclass again. Could be leading the table in a top car.

mon frère  joyeux anniversaire 🎉
Team Max forever 🎉🎉Red bull
Sargent saying something failed on the front right, he’s right but it only failed after he smashed it into the barrier 😂😂😂
How far the Alpine have fallen in 2024.
4 years later and we finally have a new dutch gp winner. gd job antonelli
In the wet with slick retires, a number of technical advantages of the car are negated and the driver's real skill come out. Alonso is miles ahead of both Verstappen and Hamilton and everyone else.
This track is a real drivers track. I've been lucky enough to race here with a BMW M3. You have no idea how awesome this track is until you've driven here. And tho it's a pretty tight track to overtake for F1 cars (which is to blame to the size of the F1 cars) for me it's a track that should be on the F1 calendar for a long long time.
네덜란드 그랑프리
0:05 why was there a Williams in 4th
Verstappen is a fantastic driver but he literally pushed Gasly off
Its hilarious to me how Max told the team darker clouds are coming in instead of vice versa 😭😂
Super Gasly??? Tu es commentateur ou influinceur,guignol socialopette.
Max’s “yield or we both crash” signature overtake sighting @ 2:39 mark 😂
How did russel go from 2nd to 18th? they didnt show it.
This race really proves that Max Verstappen is one of the greatest driver ever. There is no doubt about that.
Verstapen
🎉🎉
wat een k*t commentaar , pffffff
Faster and smoother I love that
What a race this was so many weather changes
this was the best race of the year, singapore was overrated, just cuz max didnt win doesnt mean it was better
Playing catch up for the 2023 season. And I think I like this track very much.

Alonso’s driving in the first few laps was incredible
13th most watched 2023 highlights.
Albon got a amazing start and got to p5 on the start!! Great drive 👍
f1 what a joke
Where can I watch these races live?
give that crazy hero the super car and enjoy  motor races if you still want to be  one of follower f1 ..sure that crazy man is ALONSO
Netherlands 🇳🇱
royal blood  royal blood , lee jpnes under siege ,comprenda ,
English commentary please..
This has been Alonso's best race since his comeback.Finishing 2nd in the 5th best car in a wet track like Zandvoort, no mistakes, skillful overtakes while being 42 years old.Stuff of legends.
facts: this race now holds the record for the most overtakes in one race in formula one history at 189, 63 of which occurred on lap 3, which is also the most overtakes in one lap in f1 history
red flagging instantly when real race was about to start. They are not even allowed to use wet tyres
Beautiful save of the car for redbull 😮😮😮
Very narrow circuit
Post Senna Verstapen
베르스타펀은 제2의 세나라 할수 있겠다
Monza curse
Alonso and Verstappen should drive the same car. Will be fun to watch..
Let's go #REDBULL
bring me extended highlights ...
lewis hamilton my goat
Man what happened to Lewis? Last time i checked he was winning everything
Leclerc is such a crybaby. He will never be F1 champion. Also George Russell. To soft. Doesnt have that toughness in him.
Hey FIA, wherever you put max on the starting grid, he will win. The best way to stop max is to ban him from a race cuz I wanna see someone else win:(
RedBull Google HONDA F1 racismo contra mexicanos
What a race!
😴
Hey F1 say hi to racist Helmut Marko
Why always 15 secnd ads
So tem carroça na fórmula 1 com velocidade de 320k
Oi
You can tell that the broadcasters are just hyping it up
🤘👍
Al mijn Honda's uitbrengen nieuwe vorm model kan. Ok
Tripple Zandvoort circuit Honda Red Bull racing Verstappen
Perez going from 14th to 1st in 1 lap is just phenomenal
Het Nederlandse commentaar klinkt wel alsof hij een kinderserie aan het inspreken is
Alonso is making F1 race is fun and exciting to watch again. Thanks
1:39 And Fernando Alonso goes past Fernando Alonso
I love this commentator ❤😂

Man... crofty's incessant yelling ruins the whole video. Surely I can't be the only one thinking this is unbearable to listen to. ;_;
Proszę dajcie polskie napisy
They have to change drivers for Ferrari yaa
People truly can’t say it’s all in the car. Watching Max gain almost 2 seconds on Perez every single lap when he was behind was just insane. Curse who??
Maravilhoso Meu ídolo Piloto Péres Ficou em Segundo Beleza pura Buelita Nena Rodrigues 🙌🙏😄🌹🌹💖
stick me in a formula one car with a snake and had beat verstappen ,,,
Redbull dont have a number one driver, but when Max is in P2 they let him undercut his team mate. Make it make sense
Congrats to Alonso, what a fantastic driver. In the right team he's nothing but a star!
How does anybody enjoy listening to a full grand prix with this commentator?  He is like fingernails on a chalkboard.
What country do I have to live in to watch your videos?
❤kirapnusatara
While Hamilton is behind I’m cheering for Alonso ❤
How often has Alonso shown his brilliance in cars that are inferior to the top teams....  Can you imagine Alonso in a Red Bull !!!
Alonso is unmatched
Why are the commentators screaming? Annoying af
mclearn why not change the tyer during rain time
Getting tired of seeing Orange 9 times so far 🤦🏻‍♂️
How many safety cars in this race ?
Skk,,az,sdk,s,x
The race sure was hectic with rain pouring down at the start and extremely in the closing stages! But no one could beat Max Verstappen as always!
Why didn't Verstappen get a penalty for that move on Gasly? He drove him clean out of road.
The editing of this video is just poor. Comms getting covered by not the same announcers as the race.
Osama bin russel strikes again.  Out-breaked trying to defend against Norris and made contact. He defended the inside on a quick right left ultimately choosing the outside on the corner that mattered.  Great race craft by Norris.  Poor judgement by Russell. Also the line he chose was rubbered in so would have been slicker then the line he gave to Norris 🤷‍♂️
In the rain
البقاء لله في سيارة الفيراري
To make it short: Verstappen wins, as always. Alonso is brilliant, as always.
The fitness Alonso brings to the table sets a precedent for a lot of young drivers.
Am I the only one who has to watch F-1 now with the volume on MUTE?
DU DU DU DU MAX VERSTAPPEN DU DU DU DU
Is this the most boring season ever in F1?
Bring back Martin brundle
Wait liam lawson??
Albon is awesome
One of the coolest tracks 👌🔥
This one was enjoyable to watch 😊
We all know max gonna win every race
ALONZOOOOO0
A job well done with alonso you can clearly see his agood ability and determination and ngl i also want him to win this one cause you can clearly see his performance - max fan
Zzzzzz Zzz 💤💤
Shoutouts to Lawson for surviving this rollercoaster. Congratulations Alonso. Returning back to form out of the gate!.
Norris needs to go somewhere else....
Verstappen ruined F1
Where's Hamilton?
Hi my name is aissa and I'm a Ferrari fan, ... therapy needed
Whatever is happening to Mercedes
Aye alpine doing something now
Louis Hamilton...who ???
It would be something if the commentator shut up for a second so we could hear the engines.
With the way he’s driving around corners, Verstappen is long due for a few crashes.
Fernando Alonso!! 🎉
Any footage of Ham-Nor photo finish?
What's the point of wet weather tyres 😡
That commentator needs to calm down, he'd be better suited for horse racing.
il est nul le commentateur
Wankerton-fans be like; F1 is boring... Sure boyzzz 😂
So... at lap 7 Max overtakes Zhou and is 11 seconds behind Perez.. come lap 11 and Max is only 4 seconds behind perez. So over the course of 3 - 4 rounds, Verstappen more than 2 seconds a lap fast than Perez... Perez should really question himself about this. How is this possible.
Wooow
Who's the moronic commentator?
Le dépassement de Russell au premier virage sur Norris c’est une masterclass
Max quebrou de propósito a taça da Hungria  para mim Max vai ser campeão nesse ano mais no ano que vem vamos ter novidades
Perez the New Bottas 😓
Could Alonso have sent it at the restart?
Shoutouts to Lawson for surviving this rollercoaster. Alonso showing some seriously impressive skill as per usual.
Mercedes tem que da um jeito de arrumar esses carros.
Salut  Verstappen Fery bestt and senorita  Alonso back egaint in the podium and  peres perfect congratulation for podim
If Fernando is such a great driver as a lot of these comments seem to be saying,  how come he cant even win the Indy 500. Its just going in circles.
Man I hate MV
Alonso deserves P1, gosh
Why don't they make a longer highlights showing what actually happened atleast.. So much is missing from every official highlight.
f1 max edition

Yess buut Alonso Copy allí Máx Strategy all..😢
Asyik max je menang. Bosan ah
This race could have been the best.  Tire management ruined it.  Too much tire management in between the rain.  Russel on Hard was bad…Yuki on old soft tires was bad.  I mean if you used Inters in lap 2 just keep using softs the whole time.  I like this track because of the banked corners.  I had high expectations.
So sick of watching the same guy win

I genuinely can not listen to Alex Jaques talk, drives me insane
Und wieder der scheiß verstappen
The way Alonso snatched Norris was outstanding....
What a race once again. Always rain can make a race unpredictable and very exciting. Verstappen was once again very quick but Alonso for me was the driver of the Dutch grand prix. P2 with such an amazing performance. Alonso to his greatest. Mercedes and McLaren done very bad decisions to the strategy, Ferrari disappointing once again. I can't wait for the next grand prix.🏁🏆🏁🏆
Alooooo
ferrari is very bad urgent all crew and pilots must change
One of the worst highlight ever… half of the stuff are missing

@2:38 Verstappen runs Gasly off the track when they were side by side. He didn't leave any space, he's lucky Gasly complied and ran off the track.
pov: you are trying to find a comment not about alonso
Rooting for Alonso since I watched him as a kid and now 10 years later he's still proving himself to be consistent.
Why does Pirreli bother to develop rain tyres if every time there are conditions to use them it's a red flag? Adjust speed and braking points, use rain tyres and race... If someone can't judge the situation they'll end on gravel.
Verstappen drinks 3 RedBull before the race.
It's sad that nobody is talking about Ham😢
Who is the commentator surely not Crofty
Os excessos,  os monopólios e os privilégios acabaram com o esporte.
I was super excited for rainy days' dramas but they red flagged the race!!!
Nine. In a row even in the rain where it’s supposed to be Hamiltons forte! Just give them the next race also and just get it over with you me and Mercedes not even going to win one race this year again
ERNESTO S DELA CRUZ JR
🏎🔥alonso✌️👍✨💐
Get alonso in that redbull
Need extended highlights
Bring back Crofty Sky sports
I was here and holy cow was it so cold, windy, and rainy. The videos do not do justice
Mercedes Benz ❤❤❤❤❤❤
when he doesn't say "and its lights out and the way we go!"😕😕
Circo,maroma y teatro de la fórmula uno😅😅😊😊
Who is the new commentator? I don't think I like him. Has he come from horse racing or something similar? If he shouts any louder, aliens in Alpha Centauri will put in a noise complaint.
None of Piastri's overtakes shown.  Some of those were gold.
viaplay donder op! WAARDELOOS!
Verstappen gained 4.2 seconds on lap 7 on Perez
Boring
Bring back Crofty pls!!!!
so Max just needs to win what, 4 more races to win the championship?
I have unscripted a dozen times but still receive emails please stop
Superb driving, Fernando. You're the Man. 💚👍🙂🤍💙
How did Perez end up one lap behind before the restart???
Alonso living legend !
Best race of the year so far !
GIVE ALONZO A REDBULL, GIVE PEREZ A FERRARI
Perez foi sabotado pela própria equipe duas vezes
Alonso: eres el mejor piloto. Sin duda.
I'M JUST SICK AND TIRED WHAT reb bull IS DOING TO CHECO 😣😣😞😞🥺🥺
norris still thinks he can swim on tires
Lamentable lo de las órdenes de equipo de RedBull para perjudicar a Pérez. La esencia de la F1 está decayendo.
The least competitive form of motorsports in history. The team with the biggest bank account wins, basically. Bring back IROC in spec. matched cars and see how they do🤣
trending
They pit so fast mostly because 18 men are doing work of 4 in NASCAR, and they take on NO FUEL.🤣 Just to lift it they have 2 jackers that do not need to go one side to the other, AND the air hoses for the wheel-nut-guns are dropped in from above.
6:35 that was one collision right after he was slipping and sliding and couldn't control the car
Great to see a thrilling race for the most part. Almost up there with motorcycle racing!
hij probeert als Doornbos te klinken
What a race
After these highlitghts i understood how bad i miss old commentery team :(
Jesus loves you.
Indudablemente Alonso todavía tiene la casta de campeón. Solo le falta un mejor auto...
top race ook van Gasly ❤
The GREAT FERNANDO ALONSO everyone!
A minor note, but it's nice to see Williams doing okay again.
Alonso highlights
Kom op max verstappen 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
Es la misma porquería , venden un aparente campeón , y salen con que es incuestionable , es más que eso mucho más …
Blijf het zeggen, de verslaggeving is abominabel
Mercedes => New Ferrari
QUIERO OIRLO AUNQUE SEA EN INGLÉS ANTES QUE EN ESPAÑOL LATINO
There is talk of the "circus" of Formula 1 and that is Red Bull, a true circus, where they manipulate Checo and who is in charge is Max and not to mention the Red Bull brand, every day its image deteriorates more and more, creating mistrust and That is the image they are giving because it seems that they do not realize that they are under the magnifying glass in world sports journalism.
Se habla del “circo” de la Formula 1 y eso es Red Bull un verdadero circo, donde manipulan a Checo y quien manda es Max y no se diga de la marca Red Bull, cada día su imagen se deteriora más y más creando desconfianza y esa es la imagen que están dando porque parece que no se dan cuenta que están bajo la lupa en el periodismo deportivo mundial.
Que raro que no incluyeron en el resumen la falla del equipo RedBull que le costó 10 segundos a Checo en la parada en pits
Wow get brundle & crofty back these commentators are awful
You don't have to like Alonso, but you have to admire his ability and determination.
Williams is improving day by day
Lewis needs a comeback
Not a single person talking about the fact that lando and Hamilton finished only 0.023 apart at the finish... thats literally a few cm difference... and not one shot of it!
Alonso is very nearly the main reason I watch F1 :)
This is fun.
Ferrari nel ❤
Et sinon le résumé original en anglais il est pour quand ? Écouter des Belges parler le français ça me fait mal aux oreilles
Quien es Wan Yuzu? No se pasen, aprendan a pronunciar bien su nombre 🙃
That weather was the perfect recap of this summer in the Netherlands.
Brazilian?
If Lewis or Max would've done what Alonso did at the start it would've been move of the century. With slick cold tires, full tank of the heaviest F1 car ever, on the inside of turn 3. I didn't think that would've been possible. Max made it with Gasly and he should've received a penalty in my view and I really like Max. Alonso has to be the unluckiest driver in F1's history.
How come 🤔
eventfull race,great grand prix
Verstappen as usual😂
Alonso is the story of 2023. The Aston Martin scoring P2 is bigger than Max winning every race and the struggle of Mercedes. See you in Austin.
I only watch these for Lewis Hamilton and tsu only black and brown and Asian in the league
What happened to Leclerc?
Albon needs a better car and a better team.
Wasn't Logans fault. Bro was trying steer hard af but front right was in another dimension.
Y por que no usais la narración de antonio Lobato, Pedro de la rosa y toni cuquerella?
Red bull is unbeatable
Great race. Commentators made it very boring IMO
Jokeonyou
Aqui es donde se ven los auntenticos fans de la f1 todos ingleses admirando a fernando :) y con razon
Wat heeft deze man met kaas van brood en de kaas van de tortilla 😂😂
...mmm Alonzo ganaria con 6 segundos...
Missed highlight: the partying Orange Army during red flag
Everyone so bored of talking about max they talk about Alonso
Ngl redbull and max have ruined f1 and made it boring
Ferrari should sell there team... It's not there race.... Now they don't get photo too
See max up to his old tricks pushing people off the track again. Alonso is on fire this season.
Congrats Alonso the Goat and Gaslyyy did an amazing race too 🎉
Rain is more enteresting than f1 now days since 2020.until 20 was the pit stops. F1 died around 2010
McLaren let down Lando so badly by not calling him in to box. I can't see how any time tried to stay out in that rain
Mum
If alonso had a RedBull , it woulnd't even be a race.
I feel like Alonso finishing second is more exciting than max’s win..
Every time verstappen so boring😂😂😂
The most unfair sport ever, win how have the most expensive machine!
Brilliant circuit.  Festive audience. Unpredictable weather. ... Best  F1 GP of  2023.
How does max never crashes 😂
No way. F1 is still a thing? 🤣
2:39 I thought pushing someone off track was deemed penalty worthy in almost every single race this season, why was this any different? Cuz it's golden boy Max doing the pushing instead of someone like Tsunoda?
It must be very heartbreaking being Haas drivers (and fans) 🥹 watching each car passed Kevin was very frustated 😭
Formula One has become very boring
Hamilton and Vettel ruined the career of Alonso
Everybody here:Alonso Me: Gasly P3 let’s gooooooiio
Max, 25, won his 46th race and 90 poduims and he simply celebrated, but Gasly, 27, won a 4 podium and celebrated as if he had won the world championship
To think bringing Zhou in for mediums and thinking he was gonna keep pace with everyone on softs is ridiculous if he would’ve hopped on the softs he still at least would’ve been fighting in the top 10
Verstappen on Gasly on lap 6 deserves a penalty, He pushed him off the track. What a twit…
Alonso's lap 1 shenanigans are always the greatest thing to expect to see in F1.
They need to have a yellow flag speed button so they can all maintain their position and splits.
F.ALONSQ   SUPER  STAR KLASSIK  RACE .
where tf is crofty??
Alonso returned on the podium...
Why McLaren didnt pit after lap 1 :(
Alonso = LEGEND
F1 is now an overregulated sport which has made  it frustratiing for the drivers and has become boring. so I am losing interest in it.
Buen vídeo
put alonso in a red bull
Netherlands is cheese, flowers and Verstappen.  Only 3 things people in the world will ever remember the useless country
Nn
All those salty mercedes fans are making it even better, the rain was the tears from you, i love it tx
Why is the FIA red flagging the race? They are RACE car drivers. Let them race! Absolutely pathetic.
Did anyone see how max pushed gasly of the road at 2:33 😤
Imagine Alonso and Verstapen on Redbull
Que feo circuito pista Farmer siempre gana ese marica aburre la f1
Race, 2023 Duct Grand Prix, mantap
Gee this commentator is annoying.
Moto GP and F1 are so boring lately. There is no competition but a solo run.
Maxiiieeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!
Nonton F1 gak enak, tidak ada perlawanan dari pembalap lain, Verstappen dan Redbull terlampau dominan, membosankan
I was wondering who was gonna win. BORING. Finally switched to MotoGP.

Great to see Gasly on the podium.  And what can you say about Fernando, driving like the champion he is.
Max, grande maestro. Aplausos
Did anyone else notice Max forced Gasly off the track in turn 3 2:38
zoom zoom zoom
Alonso is the best driver in wet conditions. Proving it one more time.
Great race day...
Yuki was Warwicked
F1 is worse than watching F1 driver's groupies dry their cunnies.
I only saw Dry - wet - wet - dry & wet till finish even when Hockenheim 2019 kicks back in nothing is safe till max get back into lead, Really incredible way to take a Hattrick of records with it at home,  who thought the rain is lightly? If it rain at dunes it's like Nürburgring, Man I'm impressed by this performance Sargent does the latifi while Zhou again save through halo protection a redflag for nearly half an hour they want to get back canada 2011, spa 2021 & Hockenheim 2019, Alonso back on Podium it's a present from heaven, Gasly first podium for alpine in this condition should put him "DofR" Mercedes far off the road as Ferrari again miserable pitstop, Max the king of home gets 3rd home win as it is his first rain win here + equalling sebs record like the grand slam of Senna can he decided the championship at Singapore for their first which give him the redemption win, Lawson debut disturb through the conditions, Albon with an huge effort to set back in the right direction, with monza incoming Checo is back in form to fight Max for the 1-2 championship ❤️🥳🍾🏆👏🤩
F1 needs to never again allow the drivers to race in the rain ever again and I don’t care if they have proper tyres or not!
ALONSO
Guanyu Zhou's Crash Was Horrible
If you put Alonso in that Red Bull he’d be leading the championship.
Pf, leclerc out isnt even an highlight anymore
Crofty & sky sports >
Max has 9 win in a row match for Sebastian
A bit too enthusiastic commentating a single file race; nobody doing much. If not near the front, not gonna win.
Where ferrari genius pitstop?😂
Man. Somethings wrong. The pace of the Redbull (Max) is not normal bru
Nice merc sandwich lol
If you missed the race, this is actually great coverage.  Thank you.
I can’t be the only to dislike the commentators on these highlights.
Congrats Gasly!
lobato mola mas
8 minute highlights, half of which are tyre changes, and I still have no idea what happened to Leclerc...
This has become the most boring sport to watch
yeah so I cancelled my sky sports due to this overhyped comentator I'm not going to pay for this torture and opted out for illigal f1 streaming services. FU
If it wasn't for the rain, it would have been another boring race.
تخيل ان يكون شماخر هنا 😢
Tertolong perlindungan lawson
Esta tendencia en chile ctm 🔥🔥🔥🇨🇱
Awesome! And I liked the water gun fight with the wine bottles at the end.
Verstappen forcing Gasly off track like that in lap 7 is unacceptable. Verstappen fans won't stop whining about Silverstone 2021, but if Gasly didn't move off track to let Verstappen have the lead like a spoilt child, Gasly would be in the hospital right now. But Hamilton giving Verstappen plenty of space in Copse to attempt a fair overtake is "him being in the wrong"? But Verstappen forcing Gasly nearly into the barriers is "fair racing"?  Verstappen fans are the biggest hypocrites in F1. Absolutely unbelievable.
Waiting for ferrari to get it together still
this, cringe, commentator...
The gap between Perez car and Verstappen is way too obvious. I can see why some people are becoming suspicious of the whole situation.
Sabotage Lewis’s car and you all get a tiny semi
YOO!!! Martin Garrix
Alonso is really talented he makes F1 more interesting for me what a driver
This Alonso boy has some talent.  Can’t wait to see him develop his craft over the next 10 years.  😂
Why bother having full wet tires when every time they are needed the race gets red-flagged?
Another predictable mildly boring race… I must top up on my John Wayne Western Box Sets….it’s becoming a real yawn!!!😢😮
F1 is all hype now and no real racing just a fix,make the cars the same and we will have racing take the designers like Newey and Alison etc to fix it
Love how alonso is the bench mark for most teams above their own drivers
Why is the commentary so loud relative to the cars? Kills all immersion, especially when Alex Jacques feels the need to shout at everything in the most asinine way possible.
Ouais, c'est parti!
Verstappen Grand Prix. So boring.
VAMOS ALONSO🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
Another yawn session ... it's so boring that odd makers at Casino's are giving 0.9 to 1 on Max to win ... yeah, you give them $100 for Max to Win, you get $90 back if he does win.  Even the rain didn't impact the outcome.  The problem with F1 is that the season is pretty much over after we get to see the 1st race.  With such strict budget caps that don't allow any team the ability to catchup makes for an incredibly boring F1 season after the first race is run.  At least WITHOUT budget caps we usually had 3 teams that could win a race, now with budget caps we have one 1 team ... how is that better for F1?  No money = no progress.
feel so sorry for Russel, if not for poor strategy he would of definitely got podium
commentaires de Gaetan Vigneron, RTBF
The highlights covered ohhhhh maybe 40% of that insane race that kept shuffling the order of the drivers
If I were Lance Stroll I'd start shopping for a new tennis racket.
Alonso 👍👍
Five laps to go and a gap of 0.7s between P1 and P2, and yet many fans call it "boring" just because their favorite driver isn't in the mix. Ha ha ha!
Awesome race, never been a huge Alonso or Gasly fan, but glad they got a podium. As for Max, well we all knew from the start that all the other drivers were going to be fighting for second place.  But are we just going to ignore that Verstappen forced Gasly off the track on lap 6 ? The commentators on Sky sports talked about it at the time, but nothing from the stewards... Not even a "incident has been noted" message. And there was really no need for Max to do that, too. He would have gotten past Gasly anyway and went on to win the race...
my from brazil
verstappen respect
F1 has become a very boring sport !!
Só Verstapen ganha kkkkk, sem graça igual quando era Hamilton, kkkkk Fórmula 1 perdeu a graça 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
bring crofty's voice baaack 😭
🥱🥱🥱🥱 This Years F-1 And Red Bull not just because I'm A Mr.Lewis Fan the racing and the same tracks or the way everything around just looks so slow.
Alhamdulillah 😎🥰🤩🤲🖤🔥
Why have full wet tires if the race is just going to get red flagged anyway?
This was an exciting race. Thank you for not calling the race and letting them finish under the checkered flag
How aggressive was Vert. 🙀
not that the F1 TV commentators are bad but the sky sports team make the race more enjoyable imo
Norris 2 nd to 7 th
Wat een slechte commentaar
Fernando Alonso is something else..... C'mon, this guy need a championship car.
make them race on the wets
Gasly 👏🏻🇫🇷 !!!
Alonso is carrying Aston Martin all by himself.  Lance Stroll is pretty much useless.
I have always been a die hard Ferrari supporter, however, seeing Alonso's form this year makes me respect him even more than ever.   As far as #1 is concerned it is a foregone conclusion.
Nice job in showing us what happened to Leclerc
These guys are such a better commentary team than Sky
Smh
Had the time of my life here this weekend, amazing place Zandvoort. Hardstyle banging non stop and lots and lots of beer - thanks for having me over Dutchies. 😆😀😀
Why is this in Spanish???!
How boring F1 has become..
🎉🎉🎉
❤
F1 is Max One 🎉🎉🎉❤
Alonso - GOAT
Alonso❤
So bored
his voice is so bad
After 15 years in motorsport as a strategy engineer, I have to say that Ferrari was a pure disaster
Like him or not, but Alonso proofs week by week that he is worth every cent Aston Martin pays for him.
0,023 difference between Norris and Lewis? Where's the footage?
These announcers sound annoying
I really think F1 drivers should receive way more praise and appreciation, I mean these guys are absolutely flying even when it's wet and dangerous with little to no grip and managing to keep it safe at the same time. This sport is just pure art & elegance.
Alonso was something else & there's this thing that happens when someone passes Max, he just goes into a different zone, he was absolutely flying back to the front like I've never seen, even corner, every straight, every gear shift was as precise as it gets😂
Dutch  on holiday in italy thank you
🥱
There were 186 overtakes on track excluding position changes during the first lap and during pit stops or being lapped. This is a new unofficial record in f1 what a race
its not the same without David Croft
Everyone in the comments convincing themselves that this is interesting to watch… 150-point lead, come on 🤦🏻‍♂️ I can’t think of a less intriguing sport than 2022 and 2023 F1 seasons
The commentator sounds like he could single-handedly keep the Ritalin market thriving
So boring season
Why do i keep getting the highlights in my native broadcaster language? (dutch) I dont want that...
Yet another boring race
Does Perez still think he is championship worthy ??? 🤣
Red Flagging the race for a little rain was pathetic.
nice race
long time not watching f1, miss the engine sound
Another fixed race 😂
The FIA is really on mission to favor Max, unbelievable...   Dude forced Gasly off track and squeezed him to the wall and no investigation whatsoever...   Plus, why a rolling start, seriously ? The track was safe... Did they fear Alonzo behind ? I mean of course if it is a rolling start, Max would win easily. But if it was a standing start and Alonzo had overtaken Max at the start, it would have been much harder for Max to overtake him with only 5 laps to go...   FIA, F1...
What a boring competition, what a bore, what a bore...
Probably the best race we'll see this season!
yawn
2:40 where penalty
I don't miss Latifi anymore 🤷
The downfall of Ferrari
Why didn't Max get a penalty for pushing Gasly of line on lap 5.
Alonso Alonso Alonso I am so very very happy he is here and making much of the gear.  Do you see when Russel passes another guy on the inside Russel car twitching .... on the limit ...  so it is why these guys are paid so much.  IMAGINE Alonso in a Red Bull !!!!!  HA !!!
Yay
F1 Don't you think that the 10 seconds on Perez pitstop was a highlight moment in the race?
For F1 fans of racing, this was the best one of the year so far.
Crazy race. Rain to Dry to Heavy Rain. Alonso displayed his experiences over the years. Albon done absolutely well in that Williams.
ALONSOOOOO UR THE KING  40SOMETHING AND PUNISHES THEM WITH A MID FIELD CAR
Fernando Alonso is passing Fernando Alonso😂
Go Alonso go, you are still the King.
What a track! Aesthetically pleasing!
Bring DTM please
did Mercades hire Ferrari's strategists?
Do ppl like or verstappen
Alonso stopped the clock at 1.13.8.   Alonso overtakes Schumacher as the driver with the longest interval between his first and last flying laps.  The first was in Canada 2003, on June 15.  The last one, this weekend in tulip country.  20 years, 2 months and 12 days have passed, a new number to beat for the rest of the pilots...Fernando Alonso is the driver with the longest interval between his first and last podium in Formula 1. The first for the Spaniard was in Malaysia 2003, his second race with Renault, on March 23.  The last one, on the sodden Zandvoort track this weekend, on August 27.  20 years, 5 months and 4 days have passed, which is the new F1 record.  Michael left his mark in 20 years, 3 months and 2 days.
MAD MAX enjoy the HONDA POWER
This highlight is terrible… the race was actually epic
great race. rainy race till end of season please
Alonso stopped the clock at 1.13.8.  just before the coming storm in the Netherlands.

Checo will not be in that red bull next year and everyone knows it. Dudes gonna be dropping off my Deliveroo order next season
Alonso does not know what age is 😮 he is absolutely destroying 👌👌
Alonso is the GOAT no doubt about it
なぜ角田裕毅には不可解なペナルティが出てノリスには出ないのか？ 日本のF1ファンも我慢強いですが流石に差別を感じます。 MAXのエンジンはHONDAですが？ここまで角田に対するあからさまなペナルティの数々は理解し難いです
Race of the year👏👏👏👏👏
Why won’t they just use the wet tires? Why delay the race because they’re using the wrong tire?
Max on pole, Alonso on podium and Garrix waving the chequered flag, couldn't be any better <3 !!!!
what happened to Leclerc? I suddenly find he was out around minute 6:50... nice highlighting!
Forget verstapen!!! Alonso is the real star on this race!!!
The classic 4 seasons in one day. Textbook Netherlands.
Why does Warwick hate Tunoda so much? Why do you appoint Warwick steward who can only make such unfair judgments?
Que poca sangre le ponen los comentaristas mejicanos...
Max could pretty much start one lap behind and still win the race 🙄
Que grande eres magic alonso
Amazing how an active suspension can make one car supreme
Alonso Indy Car experience showing off
Every time Alonso is between Red Bulls, Horner and company sweat bullets and have flashbacks from 2012.

5:01 final feliz supongo , se corrieron los 2 😂😂
Kudos to Lawson for enduring this rollercoaster ride! 👍
Lol, Hamilton
Nobody is talking about gasly 😢
Race of the year?!
We need crofty‘s commentary for the social media stuff
Alonso is a class act since He drove for Minardi. If given a RB, he'd give Max a run for his money, where Max won't stand a chane even now!! And, seriously would love to see RB making Max wait for 10 sec in a pit stop.
Finally an interesting, spectacular and unpredictable race.
Stop shouting. Jesus.
Los highlights debería ser la cámara on board de Magic ALONSO
The whole community hopes that alonso finally gets his deserved race win.
Slechtste commentaar ooit
Well not showing why leclerc went out is very disrespectful to all Ferrari fans.
Great result for Albon. The way he is driving the Williams car should get him a better car. Just look what Russell has done in two years at Mercedes
Im sorry to say it, but the new commentators ruins it for me...
Bien el resumen ...avísenle al comentarista que se llama verstappen y no se llama "Ferstappen"...😂
Russell "I was forecasted for a podium"  The Rain "hold my beer"
Mercedes still sleeping here
Alonso dando clases de manejo, un super campeón. Perez de mal en peor.
F1 na Band está horrível. A tv aberta então, nem se fala... transmição interrompida a todo minuto, tem horas que nem sintoniza. Nunca tinha tido problema de assistit a F1 na tv aberta, antes. Agora é só frustração,,... nota zero!
Why doesn’t Hamilton collides with Alonso at least to take second in racers standings and finish at fifth behind Checo
There are no highlights, It´s just a guy driving in the best car and a team mate who is weak and they don´t dare to hire a better driver because of  him. I guess it´s in his contract.
F1 is getting boring again.  😴 💤 🛏
Bro where is crofty?
.if f1 2023 cars🏎️ can handle the banking of zandvoort, y is f1 never returning to indianapolis?
Lap 6 Verstappen literally ran Zhou Guanyu or the track. Wish someone is brave enough to not be bullied and stick to the track to cause a collision because Verstappen is reckless
max was under a considerable amount of stress to win his home race and bring the 9th straight victory home for its team. Doing that under these conditions is just brilliant. It might look easy but even Alonso says what max is doing is underrated.  Not taking away anything of the other driver performances .  But these days you don’t see many max positive posts anymore.  So let this be the one for max :)
Boring
Muchas gracias por el audio en español!!!
Wow what an exciting season...
Warwick is racist
Better announcers today!
Perez at the start of the season: I'm gonna challenge Max. Perez now: goes off track, speeds in the pits, drives into the pitwall. 138 points behind. And still there are boneheads that think it is because RB favors Max
Am I the only one who watch this on MUTE!? Change commentators.
The race itself is very interesting. One thing that bothers me is the inconsistency in the penalty rulings that some race directors make. I don't want to enlarge the subject by saying 'let the violation go' or 'don't discriminate based on nationality'. However, I think the race directors whose rulings have been questioned for some time need to relearn the regulations.
Why was perez not 3rd?
Why does it show Perez's picture instead of Gasly's When talking about podiums? Not happy with that.
2:37 fia is pro verstappen there is no other way
What has happened to F1😂
Amazing job Leclerc 😂
Alonso never fast in v6 era since ferrari 2014
I am so impressed of Alonso and Gasly on the podium today.
So, not counting the Indy 500, while part of the world championship back in the day, it was not a 'Grand Prix', Ferrari won 14 Grands Prix consecutively in 52 and 53, while Ascari won 9. Red Bull now also have won 14 consecutively and Max is at 9. Would be ironic if Verstappen wins at Monza, taking his 10th and Red Bull's 15th consecutive GP win.
what ! He said; Full Safety but I didn't see any crane there.
Change to Bridgestone
My Prediction for F1 2023- 1. Constructor Champion- Red Bull Honda 2. Driver Champion- Max Verstappen   But at the end of the season Lewis Hamilton reclaim his 2021’s world champion and crown 8th times world champion & in 2024 RedBull & Max start to decline in performance.
F c k   v r t p
il piu bel circuito del mondo
What a race and what a victory for Max Verstappen at his home race 💯
Verstappen is so dominant, that this entire comments section is full of people congratulating the person who came in second, as though it's the greatest achievement of the year.    Hilarious.
Fernando Alonso is a great driver, but still dislike him for his attitude towards Honda, but he his a great driver, but still dislike his attitude he showed towards Honda.
Highlights of every F1 race: Verstappen starts the race....Verstappen wins the race
On to number 10!
As if the result was in any doubt
Wow, Perez is doing everything not to have his contract renew at RB. Every race, another mistake...................
What a great exciting race. And wtg Max
What a fix this is turning into.  Why didn't they pit Perez in front of Verstappen?  Even if they would of double stacked Verstapoen would either come 1st or 2nd anyway.  Its an absolute disgrace!
if, you  really think that Max is winning because of his skills YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT F1.
Grande Alonso
😊🙏  The Dutch F1 GP 2023 turn out to be exciting , full of drama & a happy ending for Max Verstappen , Fernando Alonso & Pierre Gasly!  Thank You So Much everybody for an enjoyable F1 race!  🌷🌿🌍💜🕊
You can't just give the credit to Alonso ahoutout to lawson and Hamilton who moved up a lot of places
Lewis after all these car problems he still up there in the championship too, you don't see much people saying Russel outdrive him now.
Alonso, Verstappen and Hamilton are just the GOATs, what a three drivers. 🐐🐐🐐. Always they tell us with their skills why they're the only champions on the grid
why is no one talking about gasly’s incredible race?
Best GP of The season
Respect to Crofy for naming the corners by their actual tongbreaking names during the weekend.  Well appreciated.
Rain chaos safety cars and still Verstappen wins confidently. This guy is crazy.
Boring!
Carlos defending 5th 🔥 🔥
🌏🤿💃🍋💊👽⌚
Anyone else seriously impressed with albons tyre management once again
What happened to Leclerc?
Amazing video and great race…
Ver hay hay
if things hadnt gone bad at Mclaren back in 07, i have no doubt alonso would now be considered the greatest driver ever.
Ferrari top notch again. Even Perez has alone, exactly the same amount of points as both Ferrari drivers have together.
Verstappe'sn undercut on Pérez is lunar. Never seen this before between teammates.  Shame on Red Bull for this unacceptable behavior.  Shame on Verstappen to agreed.  Shame on FIA for accepting those unsportsmanlike behaviour. And shame on Pérez for not reacting. You're all wasted and because of you all, F1 is becoming a joke.
wat een slechte   f1 commentatoren tegenwoordig.
Am i the only one that doenst like these commentators? Old ones were better
Another predictable winner……boring
Sad to say lost interest in this business
yip you can see Ricardo would have done a lot better than lawso! but he was thrown in at the deep end but he has an opportunity to shine maybe next race???
Who do these three commentate for?
I like this  Commentators enthusiasm ..  But I wish you would stop telling us every time Russell  Norris and albon  get close to each other that they are great friends 😢😢😢
Max you are a BEAUTY!!! man that was a tough race but Max you still came out on top!!! you deserve it great race!!!
English?
Waarom dat nederlandse kut commentaar
Less virtue signalling please 🙏
Max won this race from that first corner. Man he is quick
Please bring back crofty
This race was very unique compare to the rest of the season, especially at the first half
The commentary is extremely boring
The commentary is extremely boring
フェルスタッペンおめでとう🍾 アロンソ強い💪 ガスリー表彰台おめでとう🎉
The commentary is extremely boring
So they called Verstappen dominant in 2022. Wonder what qualification suits Verstappen in 2023😅
Max The Cesar Emperor!!!!!!
What a race by Max and Alonso - the two standout drivers this season. Alonso said he learned the grip was high on the inside during the wet practice and he used that to great effect on Lap 1 - pure genius.  Despite how poor we think Mercedes have been they are actually comfortably 2nd in the Constructors' standings - and Hamilton isn't that far behind Alonso in the Drivers' who also isn't that far away from Perez (severely underperforming - it's like Hamilton vs Bottas in 2020 and how Max nearly finished runner-up)
WAT EEN KUTCOMMENTAAR
Nobody talks about Gasly who get podium.
The commentary and camera direction missed so much of this race. They felt more out of touch than I have seen before.
Amazing that professional race teams with scientists, engineers, computer modelling and up to date weather radar can't work out whether they need to change tyres.   And when they do make the decision, they don't have the tyres ready.  I also think after a few poor wet weather tyre choices, all wet tyre decisions should be removed from lando.
This is sport has changed beyond recognition  If it’s raining heavily then they should put the full wet tyres on and adjust their breaking zone Instead they stick with the inters and keep breaking at the same point and obviously go wide…. With todays stewards races like donnington 93 would never have happened
Verstappen is a talentless driver who just happens to have the best car. For me Perez is the far better driver. Red Bull should replace Verstappen with Bottas or Stroll.
Brilliant drive from Gasly, a well deserved podium. Alonso was phenomenal in this GP. Well done to Albon for scoring points and to Lawson for driving a clean race in these conditions. Verstappen 9 wins in a row, that's also very impressive
What a race ❤
Oh look, the same guy won again. Yawn... LAME
Show de Alonso
Give the Commentators a few cans of RedBull, they seem sleep deprivatd. Wheres the energy in their voice?
This highlight video is honestly quite bad, many, many moments of the race went completely missing (the red flag, Leclerc retiring the car, Lawson respectable debut, Perez issue in the pitlane...)
SOooooooooooo Boring F1 . I hope they change the regs for 25 if it like this in 2024 .
Que aburrido ver a Verstappen ganar. Alonso está en otra dimensión, que fenómeno
Formula 1 is no longer sensational
Why isn't Crofty commentating the races anymore?
CUANDO LA FORMULA 1 DEJARA DE TENER 1 SOLO AUTO OVERPOWERED?
So sad I missed the start of this amazing gp, but very glad to see alonso back on the podium absolutely amazing drive and brilliant overtakes he deserves it.
Can someone explain why he is the commentator for the highlights? Awful
What happened to Leclerc???
And we thought Norris has learnt from Russia 2020.
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
No mamen 10 Segundos en El pit stop de Perez ahi le chingaron El podio de 3er Lugar
Before any of them crashed, I said that Sargeant, Zhou and Tsunoda don't belong in F1, and that Perez doesn't deserve to be in the best car. Let Pourchaire, Vesti and Palou get their seats. Another mighty drive by Alonso though.
You can see half the titles over the last 15 years shouldve gone to alonso if only he had the car
Dull
What an amazing performance by the rookie alonso.
2:40 penalty for max
Fernando show he is better than verstappen!😊
Why does Mr. Warwick penalize only the Japanese? We hope for a more impartial decision. It is really unfortunate.
Verstappen is overtaking not giving space to Gasly
merci pour la version .be  , ca me manquais
Non guardo più la formula 1, solo le sintesi su YouTube ogni tanto. Quando finiranno di regalare alla redbull e a Verstappen gare su gare e tornerà ad essere una vera competizione allora forse tornerò a guardarla. Pessima gara...anche con la pioggia nessuna sorpresa alla fine...😢😢😢😢 Non c'è divertimento se è sempre lo stesso a vincere e per giunta a tavolino😮😮😮
Next Season give the Winner only a Point . Each Race .
F1 is getting so boring 😴😴😴
Give Alonso a Red Bull and Verstappen could end his career
Forza Max Verstappen..👍
I want Max to win all the remaining races of the season and set an unbreakable record because why not😅
Boooring
What Alex Albon is doing in that Williams deserves some accolades. Dude is doing so well
Verstappen gaining on Perez 2+s / lap on inters while driving in traffic is absolute madness
Excelente resumen, Muchas gracias mis amigos de siempre !
Worst highlight ever.
Alonso is making me think of he’s been the fastest driver of the last 20 years. Verstappen is in a different world but I think with the same machinery, Alonso could beat him.
Lol , jokeonyou
im sorry this commentator's voice hurts my ears
F1 loses all its credibility in 2008. The beauty and the spectacle has lost them over time with increasingly absurd regulations. I want the 80s/90s Formula 1 back! Netflix out
Ooooo fernando alonsooo
Zzzzzzzz this sport is getting boring. Same winner everytime zzzzzzzzz
I seriously have to think in the idea to make some kind of video about Alonso in 2023! What an insane rece he did!
1:40 "Fernando Alonso is going past Fernando Alonso."   Great move!
🇹🇭
I have been Fan of Alonso since 2004, and waiting about 10 years to see him racing in competitive car and boy he back on top.. glad to see him on podiums again.... 😍
Albon should get a fast car. Not william
Best race so far!
F1 great race, but why does nothing get done about the low class scammers outside the entrance of the track trying to sell fake tickets to new fans or not so smart fans who will buy it. They were there last year and when approached it gets violent or confrontation.  Its just crazy a big company like you lets your fans get ripped of by touts and you dont do anything about it!!!! Scammers have no place in f1, the prices of food and tickets are already high enough!!!
BORING BORING BORING F1
Now this has made f1 so boring boring
Max 🇳🇱 c'est 2023
I don't like the commentary
Points for Oscar!
Alonso is a gigachad. That pass in turn 3 in the first lap was sublime
can we please have an option without hysteric commentary?
Bring back old f1 please
AWESOME! Alonso shows us a super day. GREAT to see. Could not give a stuff about Max.
Fabulous win for Alonso, after Verstappen's 5 second penalty for forcing Gasly off the track. Vamos!
The Mighty Alonso.
What a great race Alonso!❤❤
I would enjoy this more if we could tone down the hysterical commentary.  Bring back Murray Walker
I would have liked to see Albon score some points :)
This is the most boring season in Formula 1
Gasly ❤
why leclerc out?
F1: why do I need to listen to the ducht comments? I want them in English
Max will score 500 points this season
Alonso showing some seriously impressive skill as per usual
Still Max
P3 = Gasly, Driver shown = Perez 😂😂 @7:40
Verstappen winning every race makes F1 boring.
Πόσο ακόμα θα συνεχιστεί αυτή η ηλιθιότητα? Κανείς δεν βλέπει ότι το αυτοκίνητο του Verstappen είναι εντελώς διαφορετικό από τα υπόλοιπα? Έχει χάσει εντελώς το ενδιαφέρον του.....ολα για τα λεφτά όπως φυσικά συνηθίζουν οι Αμερικάνοι πάντα
What happened to Leclerc?
What happens to Ferarri right now..
What happened to Charles??
Who tells about a Williams is front of the Ferrari?
How much harm to the environment was done??
A light commentary
Rain to perfect conditions to heavy rain... I thought I was watching the Australian GP in Melb
So the race gets Red Flagged because teams are too dumb to put the full wets on. Such a joke
Thats why i support Fernando since Minardi Team. Magic Alonso.
Vaya mierda. Nada más terminar la carrera se puede ver con el audio original en inglés y al rato ya te obligan a verlo con el español latino.
Lawson had a great debut. Surviving this condition is not easy
How are you Mr.Hamilton, is your Merc still there ?
Im the only one who doesn't like these commantator?
¿el peor comentarista de la historia?
Mercedes recruited the whole ferrari strategy team. Poor Lewis
Ferrari 😂😢
Fernando 🐐
Boring mate.
Como diria un latino, que rico Premio de Holanda
Why is the comentating in Dutch 🤧
Nobody is talking about how lewis came from 11th to 6th while his team mate russel fallen down the order
Imagine if Alonso was in a red bull, he would smash everyone!
Early this season many would be hailing Albon for finishing 8th. As much as I admire Alonso’s drive, I am glad no one mentioning Albon. Shows its routine for him to score now.
Just how fast Max went backup to Perez that was 10+ seconds ahead. and then stil ran further out.
Alonso was brilliant. What great racing. Respect to Hamilton for getting 4th (Didn’t see that coming)
Verstappen wins again. Nothing new 🥱
hamilton going off in turn 1 when there is a yellow flag for the crash that caused the redflag means hamilton wasnt going slow enough and ignoring and disrespecting the warning flags people have been punished before for doing that hamilton almost hit track marshals who were on the tyre barrier about to deal with the crashed car a driver died in japan when he didnt slow down in the rain for another crash he hit track marshals recovery vehicle
It looked like yuki is on for another point finish ... but ... did the alpha tauri strategist forgot that they are still racing and went out to party early?  📀🎚🎛🎚📀
Underrated drive from Lewis. Dude made the bad strat, bad pit stop and horrible grid position work. If DRS was on in the final laps, the podium potential was there. Congrats to Pierre tho. Nice seeing somebody else up there
Gasly gave so much space to Ver for that overtake, glad he managed to get 3rd because I thought that move was a litte unfair
This guy is way better than krofty
Verstappen 🇳🇱 🥇 👌
Alonso and Vettel would be a dream team!
I think Ferrari has the worst drivers since Berger Alesi era.
No extended highlights?
What’s going on with Mercedes?
Pierre let’s go !
It's unbelievable how Verstappen flies in wet conditions.
alonso great drive again that banked corner he  made them look silly
Oh Gaëtan Vigneron 🥰🥺
Huge stuff fro lawson just finishing the race but the p13 is a greay result. Let him replace washed up ricciardo already!
that green driver :))))
Fernando is still that guy
The ferrarist disaster has a name: Frederic Vasseur! And one responsible: John Elkann!!!!!
Mercedes pulled a ferrari strat
What a race!
3:29 What is there on Verstappen's right fore tire????
The Dutch fans ❤❤❤❤
So boring when Fish face wins it.. ZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzz
Sigh...if it rains you put on wet weather tires and keep racing.... honestly it's boring to have chaotic races red flagged because teams are unwilling to switch to a slower (but in proper rain) faster tires.
😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
Where is Crofty??😢😢😢
You don't want Alonso behind you 😅 An amazing strategy from Gasly team🎉 Redbull don't take Checco serious 😒
I'm gutted Mclaren didn't box Lando for inters on lap 1
am I blind or did they just miss Leclerc's retirement?  P.S.: great Alonso again 😜 (Alo/Str 168/47 - something strange with "2nd car")
Merc joining Ferrari as clown strategists
Stroll getting bashed by alonso
Gasly driver of the day.
6:37 This got me ptsd of Suzuka 2014😢
Even though Max won, most attention goes to Alonso
やっぱり雨が降るとレースはわからなくなる。 そんな状況でも力を見せるフェルスタッペンはさすが。 個人的にはアルピーヌ贔屓なのでガスリーの表彰台とオコンの入賞が嬉しい。 サージェントは予選から本望じゃない結果が続いて悔しいだろうな。
I can’t believe that Max won again.  🥱 Yawn.  F1 races have become so boring.  Penalties for racing hard.  No chance for anyone to win except 1 driver.  Half of the field fighting to finish 10th for 1 point.  BORING.  Change the rules to actually make the races a competition rather than an obvious conclusion.  So LAME!
can we please bring back David Croft's commentaries for Youtube highlights!!!
Albon is legit this year!
Why is nobody talking about Max closing 4s to perez in one lap, with the same tires? Is this considered normal nowadays?
The commentary is getting cringey and cringey everytime
Race so intresing becauses, rain and red flag and rain again...
ferrari is finished.
so no pen for Russell  not yielding to a car a lap ahead
Alonso on fire in zandavort..
Baby cry (Max Verstappen) win again 9 in row well done cheaters, after robbery last year. I will never watch this game again.
Alonso is the monster.. please give him a proper car instead of those kids
What a race but boring
Very proud of Oscar for slowly creeping his way  to p9 and keeping steady all race in such tough conditions 🇦🇺
Why does Sargeant sound so Canadian. 🤔
The proper diversity winners
Come on show how leclair went out of the race and make sure to show all 20 places in the final results. You guys are slacking.
Commentator sounds like he has a a gun to his head
why Warwick always penalized Yuki ?
Congrats to Alonso. He sure was better than most of the younger drivers.
Kudos to Lawson who had less prep time and still finished the race under bad conditions above Yuki and Bottas
Alonso the legend.
did anyone realise that if Alonso had that pit stop going right the race would be very different? especially if the Alfa Romeo hadnt crashed. we Could have seen Alonso P1
How the heck did Verstapen not get a 5 second penalty for pushing Gasly off?
Boring. Always verstappen
チームがミスしなければ角田はポイント取れるはずのレースだった。
Alonso is a fighter
If i were Haas, i wouldve started in intermediates instead of slicks. They dont have a chance on slicks, they should have just gambled on inters.
Bring back the voice of F1 to commentate
Boring
What on earth was the Mercedes strategy in that race…
What a fantastic performance from Fernando Alonso
why you are not using original audio, but this fake commentary?
do indycar style highlight videos, action under 30 minutes ♥️
This is one of many examples to say that blind numbers don't tell all the truth. What a masterclass from Alonso. He's a legend and one of the best of all time.
Boring
Def top 3 best race season of the season so far.  The race was so chaotic start to finish.
🐷🐷 Max Verstappen🐷🐷  🇲🇽🇲🇽 Sergio Pérez 🇲🇽🇲🇽  Viva México cabrones!!!!
The reason F1 keeps everyone glued to the race is all down to the Magic driving of Alonso.
Pleasee someone tell me where can I listen to these commenters?? Alguien me diga por favor de que canal son estos comentadores?
Gasly and Albon drove superb races today!!
9 wins in a row - historic, impressive, boring
Buen trabajo checo esperemos que llegues para la otra animo
Alonso was on fire today and Hamilton works his way to 5th place after tracing around the back of the pack all day!!  Awesome job by the world champs!!
Did anybody notice how fast max was. From 10sec gap to 3 sec gap from perez on a same tires.
HAARP puttin in that work
9 consecutive wins, I'm so proud of you Max!
GOAT AlONSO!!
Can we just stop with this announcer and his mouth full of marbles and voice that is like nails on a chalkboard? Please?
Why don’t they use the normal commentary for these videos??
This season really showing how Alonso's time was wasted in Mclaren-Honda. What a shame.
I would love to watch it without commentators.
i guess Lando and McLaren still haven't learned from Sochi huh...
This is by far the worst year in F1 history. No competition. This is shameful. FIA needs to fix it.
This is most exciting race this year
Hoy no vi la carrera, y ondeo la bandera de cuadros el amor de mi vida Martín Garrix, que diosito me diga que hice mal para que no me despertara a verlo😭🥹 no me lo perdonó...
So hilarious how max is faster than the cameras and never seen during the race until the end. 😂😂
Great show of fortitude from Lawson.
Ham you should have known about Rain.
Mi chiedo che cosa sia diventata la F1. Senza vera competizione, con eccessiva ricerca della perfezione su telaio motore gomme elettronica che snaturalizza il concetto stesso del pilota. Le macchine volanti non lasciano spazio a fantasie e capacità dei piloti. Tutto il sistema sembra fondato su  una vertiginosa corsa alla perfezione della perfezione. Mi sbaglierò, ma è diventata inguardabile. Mi direte e il business ed è  sempre andata così.... sono prototipi in continua evoluzione. Giusto. Ma i piloti dove sono????
The best driver, Ferando.
Wow Albon in a williams made it to top 10
Albon not pitting for inters the first time baffled me.
For all race fans put alonso in the seat of perez. Can you imagine the battle for championship 😀
Max could win every race this season
Fernandoooooo🔥
Enough redbull and max. It is so boring
I was hoping to see Ferrari's amazing pit stop for Leclerc.  How do they not give that a few seconds?
NO SIRVE LECLER Y SAINZ 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Maxxxxxxx🎉😅🏆👏
Max is sublime.
Take red bull out and this is the best sport to watch
Best race this year!
Just give us the Crofty version…
The only thing more boring than F1 is NASCAR
Give him the best car and see wonders… Fernando Alonso.. you never stop inspiring
F1 is soooooo boring this year
So sad seeing what a joke F1 has become!
great race
It's hard to believe that we are not witnessing one of the greatest to ever do it
Merc and mclaren not pitting lap 1 still boggles my mind
Was a new fan getting into F1 but stopped watching because Max wins literally every race. Just shows me the sport is flawed.
A Red Bull driver securing 9 wins in a row... Truly a repeat of 2013...
Checo OUT
fernando in that red bull, seriously
Present day F1 has nothing to offer anymore!!! Max has the same hights as a Ayrton Senna,... Mmmm Senna drove in every form of rain,. And was the best in it! Today on zandvoort they even go out of their cars and walk around and wait till the rain is gone!!!!  But everytime you here from the reporters, Max is at the same heights as a Ayrton Senna, a Michael Schumacher,. Bleeh Let them first get cars that match each other! And not 1 powerfull car that nobody can get close too!! Its not a driver competition but competition of BIG FIA MONEY,  Matchfixing???????
stewards isn`t fair to Tsunoda.
Q hermoso cuando llueve😊
no matter the conditions, no matter the random events, no matter the pressure, no matter the strategy, mad max finds a way to win. he is the greatest talent to ever do it.
Fire Warwick right away. worst of worst.
7:59 Lance Stroll has 47 points in 9th place while Fernando Alonso has 168 point in 3rd place with THE SAME CAR! Lawrence Stroll really needs to make a business decision here if he wants AMR to be a top team ever
alonso in that car, with that team...probably the best driver in F1 right now.
Albon and the McLarens shafted by team decisions 😔
COST CAP CHAMPIONS!!!
Boring
how tf was that no penalty for Verstappen who completely drove gasly off the track??
Stroll is pathetic they really need to drop him. Alonso gets second while Stroll cant even get a point unbelievable
This sport is so incredibly boring. What an utter joke. Alonso was far and away the best driver. Max winning even when there are drivers far above him really highlights the embarrassing nature of motorsport. Your car is more of an athlete than you are.
Landon is terrible judging grip in rainy conditions. And he hasn’t realized that, his tone is very telling
It just doesn't make sense... intermediates are always faster than wets if it's not too wet.  And if it's too wet, the race is called off anyways.
Driver of the day: Rain
Que carrera del Máquina
Yuki😢
Glad to see Lewis not winning a single race this year... Definitely, not the 8th championship ever!
This season has been disappointing in terms of how leveled are the chances of winning. The teams outside RB are having the most interesting battles on track when we should have a general battle in all stages of the grid.
Legend max !
Lo que hizo Red Bull, es un atraco a Checo Pérez. Son unos sinvergüenzas.
Messiiiiii!
Race of the Season!
Verstappen look like magic likes M.schumacher ✅
Alonso is a legend ❤️. Max is a beast
Anyone who still thinks the Alfa Romeo is not one of the slowest cars by far needs to wake up  Zhou was up in SECOND by like 8 seconds, and still fell all the way down to 13th without a prayer before he crashed
Where’s the other commentator?
Lewis going from P20 to P6 in the rain is Bravado at it's most prestine!
PIEEERRREEEE GAAAAAAAAASSSSSLLYYYYYYY
What happened to Norris?!
Albon very perfect  from thailand 👍👍👍👍👍
Perez throwing his race away once again
Alonso alonso alonso alonso
boringgggg
Alonso tem que ganhar uma corrida essa temporada
ALLEZ PIERRE
HONDA PERFECTO ✊
Alonso and Gasly great drives. Max wins again (yawn) and Checco puts another nail in his coffin at RedBull. Maclaren up to old tricks again in regards to driver "strategy"? when the race was stopped Piastri was well in front of Norris, then on resumption of the race Norris is in front?? What happened there?
Hamilton hiting cars again
it makes me sad that Perez just can't catch verstappen
Verstappen has a superb car but it's Alonso we have to praise more with the Spanish veteran still up there !
why did norris stay out an extra lap…. blud didn’t learn anything from russia
Albon blundered by not coming in for the wets. Perez turned his fate by doing so before the others. That's race craft!
Alonso Forever!!!!
This race in such rainy condition would have been SO much more exciting 2+ years ago…
everyone talking about alonso, but man gasly deserves some appriciation aswell.
This was definitely a race I enjoyed a lot. The changeable conditions were epic.
Gasly ❤
Pirelli need to fix their tires so they can race in the rain. We really missed out this race.
Alonso com um carro bom max  não ia ter moleza
Are full wets no longer a thing? I'm seeing people aquaplaning off on intermediates
Except Max winning as usual, I was like "what is going on?" throughout the entire race
Ngl Red Bull winning 10 in a row is amazing yet boring.
What Hamilton is doing?
pinches narraciones de estos comentaristas, parece que narran un velorio.
this commentator is so annoying
We gonna talk about how Pierre Gasly just stole Perez's podium?
Great race with some great standout drives. But this race was further showing that Ver, Alo, and Ham are in their own league.
Sorry, but the commentators are not up to par. Crofty, Brundle are the greatest. Alonso has been my favorite for a long time, I'm so happy he's doing great. Love that man!
I wanna live everyday like I'm Pierre Gasly making the podium due to an enforced penalty
If this was one of the most exiting races of this year, im still so bored of these ground effect cars, so bored, can't wait for 2026
One of the best races so far this year
Mclaren, come on guys. Lando is amazing on track but its time to overrule him on staying out in the rain.
Alonso giving a masterclass at 42 years of age. This man deserves a win and SOON.
It's hypocrite to say boring when everyone know you will watch next races
Driver of the day - Alonso. Most overrated driver on the Grid - Russell, which i have been saying since 2019 and his sham year with Williams, which did everything they could to put him ahead of Kubica. What a joke.
MR. hopp 2 🐯🐰🐼
Wth happened to Norris???
That was vintage from Alonso making 5th to 2nd on starting laps. Took us back 13/14 years. Still the young matador fights with the same zealot.
Warwick👎
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh somebody stop max plsssssss
Dear sweet Max.  I feel like all teams that didn't change to wets when that rain came in at the end should have been penalised. It was red flagged due to GREED.
If Alonzo had the same car as Max he would destroy this field.
Lets go redbull
Lucky Alonso was there… otherwise bit boring 😂
Man Alonso is 3rd in points in his first year at Aston Martin.
MoooooD MaaaaX‼️👊🏾💥🔥👍🏾
Mercedes cant win if they don't start on the front or second row sad.
Only weather can make F1 interesting.
Si nadie en RB lo hizo, necesitamos enviar esto a la FIA  para presentar una apelacion por la sancion a Checo haciendo notar que Checo no fue culpable porque su carro estaba patinando y era casi imposible de controlar, sigue texto- "To Whom may concern; With Due Respect I wish to made a Claim against the Sergio Perez Penalty, We do not need  that Sheldon Cooper comes here and may tell us that this car can not be stopped because it ¡Was SKATING in the rain! and that was the reason because Mr. Perez was unable to control the car because with out friction between the car and the track you may not activate the brakes and stop the car. you may check the TV images to see the way that Mr. Perez comes to the pit lane, even make a little crash against the side wall at the pits entrance."-
boring..
traz em português por favor
The lead commentator drinking way too much coffee.
Every comment is about Alonso... The best driver on gird for sure💚🤞
We really are witnessing history with Max....
Man those leak documents that versapen could have 400+ points on the end of the season yeah
as a ferrari fans, it's doesn't even feel pain anymore...it's the team, the car and NOT the drivers(Alonso, Vettel)
Bernie Colins is so annoying. She needs to keep that mouth shut
Hamilton's comeback was amazing
Alonso!
Alonso has by far the best racecraft of any driver on the grid. Max can't overtake anyone without crashing or forcing another driver off the track unless his car is 40kph quicker on the straight, and Lewis is simply too scared to make a move in any car that's not the W11, but Alonso can pull off great moves and defend position regardless of the machinery he's given.  BTW this is a joke as there is Bottas with his 10000 racecraft rating.
Painfully slow, you guys get slower every year
Shout out to Pierre Gasly for the podium!
One of the wilder GPs I’ve attended. The rain that brought out the red came on like someone flicked a light switch, and everyone began running for cover! I made a few new friends over how odd it was to be huddled with complete strangers in the safe (but definitely smelly) confines of the track toilettes!
Oh wow, Max wins. How exciting 🙄
Albon though
This was the most insane and unpredictable race ever 🔥🔥🔥
Scripted races in the way that you already know who’s gonna win the race boring racing my opinion
I feel for Yuki. What a terrible penalty. Dose Warwick discriminate against Yuki????
This is BS, again this is not a sport anymore, this is a bad circus contolled by the FIA and Red Bull, shaaame on you 👎
Why if we are watching it on TV are you screaming?
Slap Alonso in a Red Bull and we'd have fireworks between him and Max. I'd actually start watching again instead of viewing the highlights on Monday.
How come Albon just went from 3rd to 8th before n after d rain can anybody explain 🤔🤔
BOTAFOGO DE FUTEBOL E REGATAS 🖤🔥🤍
McLaren's front wings are deadly weapons, literally punctured two cars with light contact.
One of the best races this year.
マックスは自分がやられたら文句言って平気で幅寄せしてるや!引退しろ
Anyone knows if Logan Sargeant was picked up still? 😂
Alonso yesterday gave us the vibes that Senna once did...'if you no longer go for a gap which exists,you are no longer a racing driver'...he's 42 year's old and still has the burn...legend...😎👌
Alonso showed a master class in driving today. Was  such a roller-coaster of a race but he held up and proved to everyone that he has still got what it takes
El adelantamiento de Alonso de la quinta posición a la tercera pasará a la historia de la F1
Drone camera was lit!
La narración española es más técnica. Me gusta más. Ni hablar de la Inglesa
I think Perez takes 3rd place how could Gasly suddenly overtake him
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Checo cometio un error si pro q checo entre ants q Alonso es icreible, le llevaba mas 9 segs faltando 10 vueltas nunk db entrar un RB ants q un Aston Martin eso jamas, mas apart la mala parada d pits đ checo d 10 segs
Alonso driver of the day. Solid all the way through.
I didn't predict that Gasly would stand on the podium, I felt bad for Perez for getting a time penalty for speeding on pit road.
This Dutch Grand Prix is amazing
Fernando (not Checo) is a legend
Bue. Otro año aburrido.
Honestly the first ten laps were super interesting
Blessings, John 3:16.  Jesus loves you.
max is 2 levels above perez . end of  story
Fernando Alonso be like, Are you entertained...... Brilliant Brilliant drive pure  legend
boring
Nice win Max!🏁
Alonso!🙌🤟
I just want 1 win this year for Fernando. He deserves it, Aston Martin deserves it.
i don't care about verstappen , is so boring , but alonso ??? what a race , legend ,
Liam Lawson did well ,thats the end of Ricciardo ,there will be no come backs now
team order. perez got the right call then team gave win to max
They didn’t show us of photo finish between Lewis and Lando
I think we can all agree that this was a banger
That 0:20 has got to be the overtake of the month!
Verstappen my favorite 😎♥️🎉
Somebody, anybody, PLEASE Verstophim!!!
We need extended highlights there’s so much radio and drama that was missed in this
Balapan yang sangat membosankan
Ham didn't got a podium but Alonso got it can the podium order change in the next race like. Alonso , ham , vestapen  Excellent performance from vestapen 9 wins in a row 🎉🎉
Why is this in french and how can i hear the real commentators
Boring boring boring
Great race, but how did leclerc dnf??
McLaren needs to learn giving clear instructions: "Lando. Rain. Intermedates NOW!"
waiting for someone to meme "Fernando Alonso is going past... Fernando Alonso"
ASTRO  M  2023  MUITO  BEM
Always liked to see the sea of orange .
The fact that verstappen is breaking records that was set by a car that was nerfed by the FIA is proof that we NEED to start asking questions as f1 viewers.  This is straight up ridiculous
i did my first kart race after this grand prix. it was awesome.
Han visto cuando de sus visualizaciones vienen de México? Y si vienen de México, es por qué seguimos a @Checo Pérez
Boring to see F1 now..
Red Bull 's sabotage of Checo Pérez is already shameless
Derek Warwick is crazy😂
Eu vivi para ver o Alborn com a Williams passar o Russell com a Mercerderz.
Porque sempre cortam a parte das luzes vermelhas se apagando ?
Kinda sad about the williams strategy. With Albon's pace, he totally could have had a podium.
Alonso's slide job on the first lap should be one of the best overtaking of the season
Pérez méritait beaucoup mieux sans sa faute il aurait terminé 2 e
Why r tthey shouting like anyone else cant hear them normally🤦‍♀️
the sense of speed in this highlight makes the others look so boring
There is no chance to use fullwet tires. when the scenario is the properly, the race is suspended.
What an amazing testimony to all those F1 drivers being able to race in conditions like that.
Congratulations to Max on matching Vettel's consecutive 'win record' under scary race conditions.
I am cheering for Alonzo! But Max is unstoppable.
Alonso is the king of adaptability.. he just adapt to what ever situation & car he has... amazing
The RB strategies never ceases to amaze me. Sad to see Norris's career ruined. I feel that he is a great driver, but needs to learn to drive in traffic.
Crazy circuit
Boring verstapen
time for the bull to bull out
this race seemed to go on for ever, i stopped streaming it and came here to get it over and done with, a choice i do not regret one bit
Great Fernando Alonso IS Légende 👍👍
Fantastic race, it had everythingg. Alonso is and will always be a legend. But please never upload the Dutch version again
Wish they put in the scene where charles came into the pit but the tires werent there. Ferrari screws up almost everytime
Editing is top notch. So much covered in 8 mins
Alonso double overtake at race start is insane
💡💡
Race Highlights at Zandvoort for Formula One.
PIEEEEREEEEEE GASLYYYYYYY
Quit checo from Red Bull
Alonso masterclass
If car performance advantages are discounted...I once read Fernando Alonso is the 3rd best F1 driver in the history of racing...I don't question it any more...
Dull
Such bs.
Snore. Another max win. F1needs to start looking at red bull.
This just proves that Alonso is the greatest ever.
F1 is really exciting for Dutch people, boring af for everyone else. Hence the multitude of comments for Alonso.
Chove, para, chove, para. Cara que clima maluco é esse, hahahahaha 😂
Top gereden max 👍
🥱🥱🥱
Remettez nous les commentateurs en anglais svp. La c’est éclaté. On se croirait dans un bistro avec un mec sous Ricard sans vouloir être insultant.
where ferrari??? wkwkwk
even the most exciting race is boring bcos of max
How great you are, Magic!
Fast car fast driver Max Verstappen
Calling him just "Norris" makes me uncomfortable
i like the new Championship standings Display its more easy to read
This Dutch commentary is beyond awful
Skill Alonso selalu bikin terkesan.2016 semua pembalap di overlap
Payah juaranya itu itu teros 😂
Fernando, just an amazing super driver!!
Are the commentators really this excited? 🤔😅  There should be rain for every race for these races to be really exciting 😎
Crazy weather man 😄
Loved to see Alonso separating the two bulls, this has been one slow season, really hope bull can end up with an equal car on  a opposing team, I don't even think Sergio's car is tweaked the same as Max's, max is coming across such a brat past two years, before anyone says I'm not a Lewis fan at all either, I'm a mclar n man through and through
F1 BECAUSE SUPER BORING BECAUSE OF MAX
Never realised how much of a beautiful track zandvoort is
I've had enough of Max going understeer inside a driver to overtake. idk it irritates me.
Another race where Pérez gets shafted left and right by RB. First saying for him to do 1:24s per lap and save tires, while saying for Max to do 1:22s. Then not calling him first for softs when he's leading, calling Max instead and undercutting him (and before anyone says anything, yes, it was RB decision to bring Max first, not Max himself. The fact Checo asked "did Max undercut us?" shows how he's just a side character to RB). Then when changing to intermediates, they do call him first, but of course, the tires are not ready and he loses a bunch of time. And finally calling him for full wets when it was raining hard when most teams where just waiting for the safety car or the red flag, ending up stuck in the pits. It's like RB is an amazing machine when it's Max and goes into "Ferrari mode" when it's Pérez.  Really don't get why Max needs so much help from RB since the car is clearly made for him and he has a huge lead in the title race, plus is 0.5s faster then Pérez in overall pace.
Pity for Checo
Meh RedBull again. Boring
Red Bull: Driver great ✅  Car great ✅  Pit crew great ✅  Strategy great ✅  —————————— = Victory ✌️🏆 🏁
Just one thing, FERNANDO ALONSO
Cuánto les pagarán a los equipos o autos para ir de últimos. 😂😂😂
Wow!!! Max has not the fastest lap!!!
Komeng masih OP wkwk
rain falling at the last 7 laps was something... great timing..
🦵🤘🤙👋🤟👑👍❤️
Les commentateurs cest horrible a ecouter en Francais, aucune passion , aucune emotions, cest francais quoi cest nul
1:41 FERNANDO ALONSO IS GOING PAST FERNANDO ALONSO!
Saudade do narrador David Croft.  Esse narrador da temporada parece o Graham Norton falando 😅 só falta a risadinha dele com falta de ar.
no mention of RB calling in V instead of P for the first pit stop putting him in front....they did mention it was to cover A but P could have done that anyway.....
The main commentator's inability to modulate is bizarre & disturbing!
The best moment was when Ferrari pitted and the tire carriers decided to finish their ice cream before they brought out the tires 😂 classic Ferrari
next time use F1 commentators not these 2 cheapheads
why you no upload Crofty commentary?
Shoutout to Pierre Gasly who had a quiet race but gets his podium after gaining 9 places
I just hope this is not a sign of things to come we had the boring era of McClaren now we appear to be in a Red Bull boring era  Max is just short of being double the points of second position in the Championship when we going to see some competitive racing instead of Dominance
@2:37 typical max 🙄
El plan & gasly are back to top 3
Love to see my boy gasley on the podium ❗️
Alonso need a new teammate
Time for stroll sr to make a decision, they could easily get 2nd place with a decent 2nd driver
Jembot ah
can they fire this terrible commentator? sounds like an american faking an accent
Totalmente aburrida e intrascendente la f1 siempre gana el mismo, y los que transmiten la carrera le quieren dar un color!! Yndi mucha mas divertida de mirar.
Another max snoozefest
What happened to leclerc?
L LANDO
would be nice to know how leclerc retired dont you think?
How was verstapens move on lap 6 not punished for forcing another driver off track when the track is defined by the white lines? Not looking for a argument or the rest of it but just wondering
Super max
what a race
Best race so far
Alonso is five time world champion really
I find it impressive that both Crofty and Alex managed to similar phrases like "Fernando Alonso is going past Fernando Alonso"
What a race, what a crowd, a very eventful day in Zandvoort.
fooking clown commentators
The fact that redbull didn't pit Perez 1st when leading  has to say something!
Wait how’d Leclerc get out?
I un-subbed from f1tv because this bs be boring now a days. Verstappen is like the only racer racing himself out there basically...
ワーウィック👎️👎️👎️👎️
What a race
Surely the FIA need to investigate why Staffs car is faster than everyone elses, this is so boring now!
Noris didn’t learn when to pit for inters..
Carlos Sainz > Leclerc.
Verstappen mai ke boer
Sky commentary barely talked about Alonso..
Alonso had the best quote, " I did think about trying a move at the last restart, but then I thought maybe I cannot exit the circuit! So, I stayed calm in second.” ...The old Fernando would have gone for it and been dejected with second, but I like this new attitude.
That last pit stop was a unnecessary farce by RedBull for Perez. Easy podium thrown away.
this race is brazil 2012
Albon going past Russell 😂😂  Should have stayed at Williams, Georgie boy
Didn’t max just push gasly off track?
imagine Vettel in the Aston Martin... fighting for p8-12 with lil Stroll?!
This season Ferrari not more horse power but donkey power 😅
Everyone is saying yeah we know who's ganna win every race, ignore it and watch the other 19 drivers, where you should be embracing Max and his dominance. The guy is making history in front of your eyes. ✈️🏆👑
So if it rains no more racing ever
Not for nothing, but I love watching Hamilton struggle.
Red Bull needs to dump Perez
why verstapen is not penalized foe pushing Gasly off the track on lap 6?
Alonso might he the most talented driver on the grid. Would love to see him in a Red Bull fighting Max lol
Wheres crofty?
uh, the z in zandvoort isn't silent
The highlights should give a 10s run down of the grid to see who starts where, always spend the first few corners trying to figure out who’s where
From a top F1 team, Ferrari become a bad joke!
Y le Juegan Chueco a Sergio Pérez Una vez mas !!!   CHECO ERES EL MEJOR . ORGULLO DE LA NACION NADIE MAS GRANDE QUE TU POR ESTOS LUGARES !!!!
why would lando stay out in that downpour at the start?!?! not only is he very slow, he risks aquaplaning into the wall.
Absolute masterclas by Alonso
Porque sancionaron a Checo?
Alonso is the BEST!!!
Estos comentaristas no tienen emoción alguna...
happy for gasly he deserves that podium
I’m not hating on the guys talent but as a newish f1 fan it’s getting pretty boring watch the same guy win every week.
All eyes on Alonso!!
Wet tyres are completely useless apparently, boys lack of skill on the moonshone conditions
Classic Alonso.
Your announcers need to calm down.
Alonso is still my GOAT. What a driver.
Awwh no highlights of tsunoda defending like a lion, bit u fair there
F1 should save some money by not bothering with manufacturing wet tyres. It seems like if it’s wet enough for those tyres, nowadays they treat it like it’s wet enough for a red flag until you no longer need the wet tyres…..  I get it as safety is all important but why bother why pretending like wets will ever get used anymore.
That intro reminds me of toto hahahaha
Quien está al frente de la administración actual de Red Bull son una pena, vergüenza para la propia franquicia, no les va a durar mucho el gusto, si siguen tratando y haciendo ese tipo de acciones que dejan mucho que desear. Más obvio no se puede, lamentable e indignante para Checo, ojalá otra escudería lo pueda contratar y le brinden un trato digno como piloto. Realmente se lo merece. Cuestión de honor, respeto y dignidad así mismo.
F1 is SOOOO BORING!! This was a little bit more exciting cause there was ACTUAL Racing. NASCAR is even more entertaining…they need to do better
Anyone notice the slow stop for Sergio Perez late in the game?  That allowed Max to come in for host stop and exit ahead of Checo for the second time in the race. Red Bull did everything to make sure Max would win the race.
ALONSO ALONSO ALONSOOO
they dont even show the entire championship standings. what a shame.
Alonso the great Titan
Alonso is the only one driver attract me to watch F1, he is the real Champion not racing depends on the machine.
best race this sesson...so far💖💖
Alonso, raga tua jiwa muda 🔥
I hate that I have to change the audio track for every F1 video on the official channel. I want the original English comments!
No flag in lap 6 to verstappen... Interesting...
Now that kimi is gone im last enjoying on Alonso when he goes all of my childhood goats will be off the track enjoying every sec on it Alonso is true og such a skill
Love this track, its never dull and today again got us some great action and thrills
best race of the season so far and Fernando Alonso still in form drove amazing today
🎉❤
And McLaren what happened??
I wish Alonzo has a wing-man, he could easily top this season for sure.
Bring crofty and brundle back to the highlights bro
Alonso is back but man, Alex's tyre strat gambled toomuch.
Can’t believe Mercedes didn’t make the call to pit but what a drive from alonso
What happened with Lec ?😢
E a Ferrari?
Commentary is trash
Alonso a real champion, so pleased for Alonso
PLEASE JUST PUT CROFTY BACK IN THESE HIGHLIGHTS, his lines are just so much more genuine and better Jacques is great just not crofty
English comentator please 🙏
What a boring race
Best race of the season!! 💯
What happened to leclerc?
Trop fort Pierre Gasly 3ème sur le podium , t'es fort mon Pierrot ✌️🇨🇵
Who is the Crofty clone commentator screaming all the way through? Ugh. Considering the changeable conditions, surprised it wasn't a crazy final result.
Era más que ovbio que Max ganaría en su propia casa
What a race
why did you cut the 5 lights at the beginning?
Easily the best race of the season thus far. Hopefully Monza is even better 🤞
Nothing stops Max, it seems.
Brilliant Alonso period
F1 is really dying. Not even raining anymore and they wait for 30 minutes for the race to restart, pathetic times
These announcers are terrible. They try to dramatically and it feels fake
Warwick, you must just retire from FIA. YOU ARE THE RACIST.
F1 is boring ...  9 in a row?
Lewis did ok for an average driver 😅😅😅
Amazing race
no one is going to talk about Sainz defense on Hamilton?
Don't forgive the Japanese who don't obey the rules, commit fraud, and pile up penalties
Why didnt they just use full wets in the second rain period.
yukiのブロックは、神技！！ 他にあれ出来るドライバーいる？ yukiは、間違いなくトップクラスだな！！
What a race! Zandvoort is here to stay
Par pitié changé de narrateur
2:38 bruh
Never been a fan of Alonso but all season I’ve been saying how he’s driving superbly this season. Really outstanding
What happened to Le Clerc, I didn’t see what happened to him in the highlights?
Esta F1 es cómo una escena norpo: todos saben cómo termina el asunto.
Congrats Alex, great drive
Alonso,Verstappen. They are the real GOAT !!
Boring...
yellow flag because people put on inters when it was time for wets, lame.
Es ridiculo que te penalizen en una carrera de f1 por ir a mas velocidad, que no se supone que es para correr.
ダッチウェザー、地元なら百も承知か。タイヤ交換祭りも悪くない。
F1 is so boring now
Zhou Guanyu crash ruining an exciting finale during the downpour which resulted in a red flag 😪
Sainz defending from hamilton to keep perez in 4th was class🤌🏻
WHAT A RACE
All I got from this is how terrible stroll is .. he has same car as Alonso
What a shame it didn't rain for the entire race.  Congratulations to Alonso once again with an impressive performance, and also a great drive from Gasley, very well done👍
I want an answer now. could the blue extreme wet tires have cleared enough water for the cars not to aquaplane in the end of the race? What are these tires for? Why in gods name dont they let the drivers tiptoe around and try to find lines and get to the finish who cares if it is a bit dangerous they get paid millions. Would this race be red flagged in 1996?
Just watching formula 1 for Fernando Alonso the greatest driver I have seen till to date
This race perfectly summarized Dutch weather
Congratulations Alonso. Returning back to form out of the gate!
i only seen the highlights but no idea how alonso finished 2nd, had everything go against him, incredible.
This is so boring watching Verstappen toodle around the circuit with a faster car than everybody else.  It's unwatchable.
Hope Alonso gets second place in the championship, he deserves it, let alone for his age and what he's still able to achieve.
Why does the English announcer have to scream calling the race. A normal voice would be welcome
If RB had only Max Verstappen as a driver, they will still win the constructors championship 😅
why F1 have wet tyre, but when heavy rain come, race stopped?
pretty sad that even exciting races end with the same old boring result. can't we just give the title to Max for next 5 years right now and let all the others race for a second world title? would be much more interesting...
Tiene coche
The comments from delusional Alonso fans are hilarious.  I found the race to be comical when RBR purposely F’d Perez. Perez will never be allowed to beat Max… the undercut was on purpose and Perez was told to save his intermediates while Max was told to go. Any driver who wants to win races would be a fool to go to RBR.
Brutal Alonso 😳
this is the fourth race that i wanted to bet a million on max. too poor.
Do you need more prove that Max is something else?🤔🤣🚀👌
alonso, what an incredible racing hero. his skill in wet sums it up 👌
I want to see Alonso in Red bull, with all my love to Perez
Alonso and Lewis showing how the oldies can still drive amazing. Everyone missed Lewis go from being 20th in the pit back to 6th
Masterclass from Alonso in this race
This was absolutely epic, what a race.
Wow, 9 straight. It’s so exciting to see the same team and same driver win every race. What a joke F1 has become.
het was leuk om daar te zijn wat een geweldige dag
Congratulations Max😊
Who is Gonna Stop him?
Max was in nappies Alonso was on podium hufff that's insane
La fórmula 1 está peor que motogp
Y el undercut de max? Y la Pit stop de +10 de checo? Vaya highlights.
Otro desastre de Checo Pérez por únicos errores suyos 😂 Dale ese coche a Alonso y tiembla Verstappen
Can Verstappen beat the record?
g rage not fearing there you said
Fue un robo de podio, a checo,solo por ser latino?
People, realise, we are witnessing an upcoming legend in his dominant years 🔥🔥
A fia é imprestavel demais. Não pune o verstappem. O cara coloca o carro lado a lado na curva e o verstappem não dá espaço. Covardia absurdo isso. Verstappem quando dispulta curva ele joga o piloto pra fora se fosse eu no lugar de qualquer um e dispultasse com ele eu acabava com ele cade as punições? Cadê as regras. Por isso não to assistindo F1 por lidar com esses absurdos que há ai. Desculpe falar isso mas não gosta de escutar minha opinião é por que defende ele e não vê o que acontece mas eu vendo isso, esses pilotos ai são um bando de frangotes mesmo. Tem carro menos superior mas dá pra brigar. Perez não faz isso e joga honestamente mesmo com carro bom enquanto há outro que joga sujo e nas curvas não dá espaço pro IA
What. A. Race. The mixture of dry and wet track made it so interesting to watch. Best race so far this season!
Logan Sargeant "something failed", yeah your brain.
What a crazy race that was! 😁
So glad Max won AGAIN... 😒
Leclerc is such a loser. Went from being Ferrari's main driver, to not having a word said about him the whole race, not even covering how he was taken out of the race in the highlights. They covered Sargent's crash though. Sad day for the Scuderia
Ay checo que malo sos!!! Ni para segundo
Max max max 🎉
@Toyota y @shell: H2 combustión motor + 🚄 + Metanol-H2 estaciones = MUCHO DINERO por tú con transportación del ciudadanos y productos 🚆
Imagine being as useful as the wet tires in formula 1
my worry is growing for Perez man
que pena que solo presente lo que le interesa seria bueno que latinoamerica no vea ni apoye esas carreras manipuladas
Circus f1
Alonso almost saved us from fishface wining.
Props to Lawson for a great debut 🔥 last minute call, only one FP, all sessions in horrible conditions and a crazy race. Kept it on the track all weekend, definitely future F1 seat deserved
Can someone tell me what happened to leclerc that he retired?
How did Gasly get a podium? Did Checo have a penalty?
FIA should penalized Max Verstappen !!! Verstapped hit Gasly car and put him out of the track !!!! ... and FIA remained QUIET !!!!
I know max has been superhuman all season, but Spa and Zandvoort he's just a different breed!
What's the point of the blue wet tires if they throw a safety car whenever the rain gets too heavy? Seems ridiculous
Here are the highlights...Max wins Yawn.
What happened to Norris? Started 2nd then all of a sudden down in 12th?
Checo is probably my vote for worst driver this season, embarassing.
So booooooring
LA BRUTAL DOBLE AGRESIÓN DE VERSTAPPEN A GASLY QUE LOS COMISARIOS Y LA FIA IGNORARON
Anyone else thinking McLaren and Mercedes scuffed there races???
Por qué no comentaron el undercut de max a checo? Están vendidos
Formula 1 acabou...se cuspir no cahao é bandeira vermelha !
Mad Max 🏎️🔥
Most boring F1 season I've ever seen. I only wish max would win a championship he actually had to fight for or didn't steal
Can't believe lando bottled a podium like that
What on earth are these highlights
Best race of 2023
In spite of all the excitement I was feeling gutted for Leclerc. What a forgettable day for him!
Big fan but it's a waste of time to watch
Commentary is terrible
Fernando Alonsooooooooooo
Astonishing what Alonso can do in a lesser able car ! From racing and beating Schumacher and prime Raikkonen, he gave Sebastian a tough time in 2010 and 2012 where Vettel was practically flying coupled with Adrian Newey's genius design and now he's still tryna challenge the Red Bulls in a far less competitive car !
Can't stand this commentator.
verstappen in a league of his own but what a drive by alonso
These announcers are doing lines of coke to be this energetic.
Tenia que haber entrado primero checo a pits y obvio noooo la guera
Son una vergüenza los de RB saben que todavía checo podria ganar a Max pero max es solo un buen conductor , de piloto. No tiene nada nuca compite
For making it more competive itnever really becomes so... Red bull is just dominating.  They could start last and still win the race LOL
Menos mal que en España tenemos a Lobato porque.... Vaya tela
Wait verstapen was allowed to run gasley off the track AND keep the position?????
Forcing another car offtrack doesn't get penalized anymore?
I can't stand Max Verstappen. He always throws his car into others and is extremely arrogant. I can't wait to see him start losing races.
I seriously have to turn the volume off on highlights because this commentator is so annoying! Why not use the sky commentary team like on the live broadcast. This dude loves to scream!
For all the fans all over the world. You see how the dutch fans are towards ALL driver's. Learn from the Dutch fans and be respectfull to all driver's.
COM A R.B.R EQUIPE JAPONESA 2023 .FORMULA 1 .
How did leclerc dnf
I can't believe the stewards punished Tsunoda for NOTHING. A small touch that caused no loss of position, no damage, NOTHING. They have been overly harsh on Tsunoda for quite some time. It's really getting to the point that someone has to step in to monitor the situation.
MAX VERTAPEM , VAI SER TRICAMPEAO DE FORMULA 1 , 2023 .BOA NOITE BRASIL , AMERICA DO SUL .
😂 Call it a race 🤥
SuperFernando strikes again.
This race was so eventful that this is one of the few cases where highlight failed to capture the most of the highlights in the race. Waiting for extended highlight!
Best drivers in the world and they have to stop the race because it rains 😅
Imagine, Alonso in a Red Bull 😍
if Alonso would have entered the Pit alongside Perez at the first sign of rain at the beginning of the race, and if his team wouldn't have wasted 8 seconds on the tire change, I feel he could have won this. Being ahead of Verstappen at last restart, he could have held on, given there was no DRS.
Shoutout to Valtteri Bottas for overtaking 6 cars on the first lap!
2:40 so no penalty for max pusing gasly off track????
Verstappen run into Pierre and pushes his out 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 lol
Perez just don't care about the seat at all. how do you let need catch up 10 seconds in 3 laps
Max drives gasly off the track, FIA 🙈🙈🙈
Norris falls again to a late Inter change.
I find it funny how the camera kind of cuts out max and focuses on second place back 😂
🌽
Alonso, Maestro.
See what handing someone with no chance of ever winning a world championship  will do for your confidence 😂
Why is this with dutch commentary???
Yeahhhhh max wins for  the 1000th time
Can you guys go back to showing helicopter shots on the opening laps. These views are pretty subpar
How did I get unsubbed from this channel?!!
When did Charles get damage?
Alonso... GOAT
All these drama to watch who will finish second 🥈😳
which language it is,¿
que grande eres magic!
This race was amazing! The rain changed everything!
What a birthday eace
7:37 FLARES AGAIN. 2nd year in a row!
Kut commentaar zeg
Rain coming in x mins at y turn. We expect medium rain in  x mins. Now why couldnt a single car start on Inters when there was heavy rain just within 2 laps?
F1 is a joke why watch it you know who is gong win. spend time with you family can catch the high lights on the news. Tell me I'm wrong
Verstappen drove off Gasly in lap 6, … didn’t he get a penalty?!??
Max driving like an imbecile as usual!
All these comments about Alonso being so great. He didn’t win did he?
can we have Crofty's regular commentary please? this dude is getting out of control, just like those yelling youtubers
That’s verstappens third straight win on his home circuit
🎉😎🏎️🏁
What happen to Leclerc? Engine issues?
Ferrari totally unconsidered in those highlights
Got a feeling that Perez won’t be with Redbull much longer.
Congrats ver and per the best
Wat een slap commentaar. Softelingen den top. Waar zijn de echte mannen gebleven?
The man Max will always go to the max in an F1 race
We start and.... Max Verstappen wins!
How unfair F1 has been with Alonso. He should have at least 5 world championships and be remembered as one of the best drivers in all of history.
Le commentarie est horrible, c'est insupportable
Congratulations max, it’s your era 🤝👏👑🌹♥️
Alonso is back!!!! Let’s go Aston and Alonso!!!
These commentators 😂😂
Fernando really did lose so many years of his prime with inferior cars.
If Alonso had had winner cars and respect the year he was with hamilton... There won't be discussion abou thr greatest ever
why isnt crofty commentating anymore?
Can’t believe I was there 🙆🏾‍♂️😂
Una porquería de carrera histórica y un sabotaje más a Checo Pérez de la FIA en contubernio con el pseudo "equipo" Red Bull  haciendo uso de todas las artimañas posibles para que Checo no subiera al podio junto a Max Verstappen.
Hamilton back to podium 🥲
Alonso manufique 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
zzzzzzzz
Boring 🥱
This is the first race I've watched from start to finish in 13 years. Why did they red flag the race so easily? It was becoming too exciting to watch? How did Max manage to put up a 4 second lead on the second place Alonso in the last 4 laps? How can only two manufacturers and drivers win almost every year for the past 10 (13 for manufacturers) years? Between 1998 - 2010 we had Ferrari, McLaren, Williams, Renault, Brawn GP,  Redbull, Mika, Schumi, Alonso, Raikkonen, Hamilton, Button, Vettel... Man this sport is boring nowadays, please@me when this becomes interesting again. It was nice to see Alonso on the podium though.
te amo alonso
PUT ALONSO IN THE REDBULL!!! 💥💥💥
Why a red flag and not just put on wets?
Years of Mercedes dominance and now Red Bull…it’s not interesting. If not for the rain this race was over by the first corner. Like the rest of them.
The paddock may have never known such passion for racing in F1 as that of Alonso. Hats off!
Fernando Alonso es el mejor piloto de la historia
Might as well remove inters and wets and also forbid races under rainy conditions if they keep triggering red flags just for a crash so that I don't waste my time. Back in the day you could see fierce battles in the rain without interruptions. What a shame.
Even the weather trying so hard to make sure Max won't get that 9 in a row but he give us a master class Drive!  9 In a Row what a drive MAX!!!
Conveniently not talking about the farce of a Red Flag - I love highlights
Max making F1 really boring these days lol
Que porcaria
It was an amazing race and I hope this second part of the season is as exciting as this race
Alonso is the best F1 Driver ever.
We need to hear engines not shouting !
Great to see red bull giving the lead driver priority for the pit stop.... Oh wait 😅
BoRING
No teneis sangre en las venas.
Alonso dale choche y te dará resultado
Alonso
I miss light out and away we go. The new voice is annoying
It’s races like these where you realize why Max, Lewis and Fred are the only champs on the grid. It’s races like these where you realize those 3 are not the same as the others. The trinity is in a league of their own. What masterclass this race was.
I was honestly hoping that Alonso would win
Most boring season ever...
Redbull mistakes left Checo Pérez off the podium
I'm surprised Max got away with pushing  Gasly off.
6:26 this gave me some vibes of Nurburgring Chaos Grand Prix in 2007 🤤🤝🏾🤤
So sad to see Norris from top 3 to 10th 😢
If Alonso had joined Mercedes, he’d be a 10-time WDC by now at least.
Perez got a 5 sec penalty for speeding in the pits, even though FIA basically negated the pit due to the Red flag and Perez not actually exiting the pits (which is why he didn't drop down to 6th). So maybe I'm wrong, but wouldn't the entire pit sequence be null, since the red reset everything back to before he came in to pit?
Martin Garrix seems a fixture in motosport circles, for some time now.
Zo slaapverwekkend wederom. De schreeuwende presentatoren moeten me wakker houden.
Shoutouts to Lawson for surviving this rollercoaster
Why can’t we have crofty and co on the highlights anymore?
Loving these new regulations making the racing more competitive 😂
I think being 42 in a sport like Formula 1 is not old, everything is in the head . Bravo 👏🏾  Fernando .
I can’t watch these highlights with these commentators, I’m so use to Crofty
What’s all this praise about Alonso ? Reading these comments you’d think  he’s won 9 races in a row. He’s past it and needs to retire
I dare to say that *Max Verstappen is Formula One's 2023 Champion!*  Has anyone had a doubt about that? 😁
Is 50 sec enough for Perez vs Verstappen? Its just tragic. Atleast Hamilton got challenged from his teammates when he dominated, this is just painfull to see😢
Super Max... 👏👏👏👍👍👍🍾🍾🍾🏆🏆🏆
Some great overtakes, Alonso is brilliant to watch
角田君めっちゃいい走りだったのに惜しかった…😓 次戦はオーバーラン無しでシングルフィニッシュして欲しいですね！  頑張れ角田君！
Who is the commentator here? He makes David Croft sound like someone from the Royal Shakespeare Company. Murray Walker got excited, but he did not shout all of the time like this fellow.
alonso was cooking this race
Bad decision for William today 😢
2:39 Max overtake on Gasly by sending him off track went unpunished?
This has to be the worst race highlights I’ve ever seen. 😮‍💨
Who's the screaming muppet?
Eventhough im from belgium, please dont make me watch the dutch commentary, cringe and 0 connection with those voices
What happened to Leclerc? How have your highlights video become so confusing and lazy?
sadge norris :(
it is begen chouda
Alonso is so much like Senna: always getting a superior result out of whatever car he has...
No constructors' standings?
Buenas tardes excelentes videos pero una sugerencia  mas largos los videos muchas gracias
tsunoda and albon both did so well
Why did they not show the epic pitstop fail from ferrari in the first few laps??
The way everybody raced was awesome especially alonso and sainz
ALBON!!!
Wait! Did i miss something? Gasly got a 5 second penalty right, so how can he end up in front of Perez. If the penalty wasn't applied because of the red flag, that would be super unfair, since he didn't serve his penalty.
Did I hear the Discord notification sound?
138 points is the lead. Almost 5 full races. Max will be able to go on sabbatical soon, and still win the Driver's title easily.
So pleased for Max and Fernando
Alonso still the greatest and smartest driver.
Just Max 💯
No hay nada de pasión en la pista de audio en Español, con el comentarista latino... Podrían poner también la de España, que te engancha mucho más...
How one-sided this year became!
A pior história da f1, uma vergonha que somente um carro e piloto é vencedor. O resto dos pilotos brigam pelo vice campeonato. Aqui no Brasil, as corridas são na parte da manhã, entre 9 e 10 hora. NÃO IREI MAIS ASSISTIR, PERDA DE TEMPO
at 2.35 how is that not forcing an driver off?
Race of the season
No Russo’s are available this decade?  Hope this is not true as Russo’s did a great job with Infinity Saga and I’m sure they would do a fine job with Secret Wars. Disney should get the cash 💰 out and pay them whatever they need to cancel anything they are supposed to be doing and get back to sorting the MCU out. Thanks Everything Always for excellent content and for PS5 giveaway.
It’s staggering how boring this season is. Truly.!
Albon's masterclass
Hamilton is such a fool.why didn't he stop for wet tyres before everyone else??  Like he's not thinking
You guys should make a fragment of only the show/fans of zandvoort. what a show and what a crowd!
SHAMEBULL RACING MOST GARBAGE TEAM EVER
Lo de la FIA ya es un chiste y no lo digo por la sanción a Checo, sino por que están ciegos a las sucias maniobras de Max con Gasly primero chocándolo (sea fuerte o levemente) por detrás antes de la recta en las primeras vueltas y sacándolo de la pista en la curva 3 habiendo tanto espacio por el interior y la FIA ni lo investigó. Gasly ni dijo nada porque de seguro supusó que ni lo investigarían. Lo de esperar 40 minutos cuando ya ni estaba la lluvia intensa es rídiculo querían secarle la pista a Max que llevaba suelto el casco del lado derecho, además de obligar a todos a usar intermedios es matar la estrategia o las emocionantes sorpresas que pudó haber. Gran carrera de Alonso es lo mas rescatable de este bodrío orquestado por la FIA que siempre que llueve hace el ridículo.
sin dudas Alonso esta en una nueva juventud , que pilotazo
Alonso best driver
F1 is so boring to watch with Verstappen winning every week. No matter what anyone does, he always comes off with the win. BORING
Happy as a Williams fan but Albons race could have been so much better if Williams hadnt completely messed up their wet-tire strategy
0:42 1:04 7:32
Obviously the tap on the back wheel by Lewis isn’t shown again…
History in the making and we were all there. Enjoy the moment guys.
Het was een super race en max natuurlijk the best ❤
Bro McLaren and wet conditions are just not a match. Imagine they take Lando in for inters immediately like Perez...man didn't they learn from last year...clearly not
Boooorrrriiiing😢
Gracias a la lluvia que existieran los mejores momentos
We need Alonso to stop max. In my opinion the only driver who is in the same level with Verstappen is Alonso
That man is an absolute robot
what happen with the end of race table ??
Max has got broken the system🎉 stop inventing just copy past😊
Russel is just awful at starts.
So, we know it is ok to push another driver off the track, as long as you are called Max.  Glad we cleared that up.
Boring boring Liverpool Newcastle
I don't like Zandvoort but that was an excellent race! Congrats to Max. Lewis Hamilton is something else in the rain...passing on the outside was masterful! Great to see Fernando take second, even with a botched pit stop.
Alonso is the master of durability.
Esos comentaristas argentinos parece que no quieren saber de Fernando Alonso
What happened to leclerc?!
He just smashed it! 👊💪
13 out of 13 won by RBR.. Max is wining pretty much on every track and every weather condition and even in chaotic races he can outpace his teammate by 1  second like its nothing. .. Something is not right, Perez is not such a bad driver, for the difference to be that big in the same car........  But yeah iv given up on F1 till 2026, last chance im giving F1.  Because yeah  these new rules coupled with cost cap and engine freeze and bunch of other nonsense. are really helping the sport. .. oh and funny how it should have leveled out the playing field....im still not seeing the small teams wining races.....
What an atmosphere, the crowd was absolutely hooked!
It's getting very stale knowing everytime It's gonna be a redbull
⛳🏆
waardeloos commentaar.
Standard Dutch weather. Changes at least once an hour 😂
This Formula Red Bull is so exciting 🖕
Yawn
His voice is so annoying
Even the FIA seemed on their best behaviour today. Letting everyone race and only stopping it when it really became impossible.
most boring season ever...
KİNG ALONSO 👏👏👏🏆
Alonso goat.
Zeszły sezon był ciekawszy...
2:40 how is this not a penalty?
VIVA LA FERNANDO!!!!! THE PEOPLES CHAMP!
max winning so easily is a dangerous sign that white supremacy is alive and well in f1. It needs to stop, we need to do better
Boring, red bull wins again
La Ferrari ormai non merita manco il replay di un out di Leclerc ? O me lo sono perso?
Magic Alonso!!! Grande!! 💪💪
Overspending the budget cap is really paying dividends this year :)
Poor commentary
That was  a terrible highlight
Once again Max does what he wants, pushing others off the track, congratulations FIA.
There is no way Max and Perez has the same car , Max has a completely different chassis and engine.
Great performance from Alonso and Gasly
¡Qué grande eres, Magic!
Which is more humiliating?  1. Perez against Verstappen  2. Stroll against Alonso
Sorry to say but Logan is on his way out of F1. It's hard to be a rookie, but there are better drivers than him.
Alonso is the best driver I've ever seen. Fast, strategist, composure, always there. Amazing!
Oh the shouting
What happened with Leclerc?
The gap between Verstappen and Perez, it’s questionable 🧐
Verstappen is destroying F1. What a boring season.
Alonso legend✌️
Another boring season, the highlight is seeing Alonso on the podium!
Alonso ❤
We need a longer version pls
I really don't know why any team would ever bother with fitting full-wets... it's like they said, as soon as there are full-wet conditions the FIA either go to safety car or red flag
Fernando ALONSO 😎
so what happened to Charles?
Boring season……
George’s missile tactics failed this time.😂😂😂
And one else force someone out like verstrapen does would be penalized. But 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
what a race
Norris, as usual, great at qualy, bad in race. Again, if he went for inters when Perez did, the race would be different.
Max winning every race is about as interesting as Lewis winning every race a few years ago.  F1 turning back into a snooze fest
Can anyone’s please explain me what's the difference max vs others cars??? is not same cars?
El nano es un jugón!!!!!
Boring once again. No competition
😍👏👍🤙
F1 talks about sustainability and tries out allocating less tyres to teams during a race weekend.. I have an idea for your sustainability woes.. don't bother manufacturing full-wet race tyres at all. It's a complete waste of time, money and resources to take them to race weekends if all you're going to do is red flag a race as soon as heavy rain arrives.  I've been an F1 fan for 35 years, but I am starting to get worn down with the way F1 is heading.
Who do you suppose has the most championships. I can never get over how white people can't just acknowledge the fact that a person of colour has the most championships in F1. When people you don't like succeed it is because of the car, but if the ones you like succeed, they are the best drivers. All things being relative, it really comes down to the car, the team and the driver 3rd. Remember, Verstappen's first championship was given to him, not because he won it.  Many of you are probably not old enough to remember races from many years ago and like today, it is whichever team that comes up with the car in that year that dominated. Senna, Vettel, Verstappen and others were just along for the ride. I was never impressed nor am I impressed with Verstappen who along with Christian Horner complain and complain until they get their way.
Nice race from Hamilton
That was a tremendous race. Getting it done in heavy rain, twice. Well done and congrats Max.  And to everyone.    Too bad about Yuki's "tires". What was that?
There is a conspiracy against Sergio Perez, change my mind.
"something failed on the front right" I mean yeah, Logan you're right... but it was you that failed.
Lot’s of people talking about Redbull should let Perez go, but I’m over here feeling very proud to se how a Mexican is doing so well in F1..  Vamos Perez!! 🇲🇽
Where‘s ferraris pitstop??
How this is only a 8 minute video is a scam
How did Perez endup behind max he was way ahead :/
Where's the Piastri move on the Alfa Romeo?!
How on earth did max not get a penalty for running gasly straight off the track???   Anyone else would of got a pen for that.
I don’t understand what are the editors doing?! Such an interesting race and full of action and they barely cover the most interesting moments.  For example, what happened to Leclerc? Why was his wing broken? Why did he quit?
Everybody hyped about Alonso and i get it, but lets not forget that Gasly scored a other podium!
why are you screaming? you can get a heart attack lol
What happened to David Croft?
I'm tired of seeing Acura Honda RB Team and Max V keep on winining and wining and winning and winning..........................................................lol
Leclerc  worse and worse.
With a view in the turn 1 grandstand this was an impressive race to witness!
All of these drivers are immense talent 🏎💫✨🌱🌿and Lewis moves with pure intuition 🏎🏎🏎💫✨😎🏆
Norris should have pitted on lap 2 to change tires. That literally ruined the race for McLaren and him.
I hate to see Max winning purely because of his attitude
if someone asks you why do you like F1, show him this race. Amazing!
verstappen je te hais
Farmers league. The red bull is too fast and im saying this as an AlphaTauri fan
The commentary in the first minute legendary
Alonso in a Red Bull would be interesting.
Fenando Alonso going past fenando Alonso!  Wow, how did he do that? 😅
What substance were Mercedes strategist on this race? Really felt sorry for George man..
Great drive from Lewis today, all the way from P14 into points, well deserved and the best driver on the grid today.
Boring race boring sport now. One team wins every season and people tell me it's the skill of the driver!?😅 No it's a race between engineers and that it!! Yawnula 1 R.I.P
What disjointed highlights.
Give Alonso a seat in the RB and he will make Max's life very hard.
Somebody save Ferrari
And the Ferrari cartoons(pit crew) continue to entertain.
Run from him. Hide from him. Alonso is inevitable.
Ferrari are just doing nothing to get on top 3 this year Lec looks down Sainz just tries to keep up AMAP
Me aburre esta fórmula, siempre el mismo, qué camelo!!!!!!!!!!
Fernando Alonso is going past Fernando Alonso!
what a race. Masterclass from Nando, and Max writing himself into the history books ONCE AGAIN
Pierre gasly deserved that podium
some rigging to make Verspeeten win as usual F1 Rigging for the fans   rigging means fun fans love it otherwise it would be a real sport but rigging means cash boys
Dont think I've ever seen so many teams bottle their strategy in the same race.
Alonso!! Never gets old
Fact:- Alonso is ace.
The main announcer is just annoying beyond annoying.  Had to mute him.
Hamiltion amazing driver❤
Is "Lights out" at the start something they dont do anymore? Noticed it a couple races this season and found it odd.
ALONSO GOAT
When the rain gets involve,the win is up to grab for everyone. Verstappen is just perfect this season,unfortunately for him,Perez is making small mistakes that cost him crucial places.This year season is very interesting.
PT: POR FAVOR FAZ MAX VERSTAPPEN SER CAMPEÃO ESSE ANO🙏 EN: PLEASE LET MAX VERSTAPPEN WORLD CHAMPION IS YEAR🙏
Alonso is the best overtaker in Formula 1 history.
Rooting for alonso to win at singapore.
“You can’t overtake in Zandvoort!”  O really? 🍺
Instant classic ...imo
Bravo Alonson tu es vraiment le meilleur
The fans, marshalls and entertainment team dancing in the rain was also a highlight imo.
Wheres crofty
I watched the whole race, and I didn't see Stroĺl once lol
And why exactly they let Perez to keep 3rd place after a pitstop?
the narration is terrible
Best race by far this season.
I’m so impressed by Fernando’s drive today.
😊
I was most surprised to see that Verstappen won.
why can't see the highlights with the original commentary with Crofty and Brundle?  These guys sound like dorks.
These red flags are starting to get reallyy annoying, are you telling me "20 best drivers in the world" can not handle some heavy rain in the most advanced race car in history? they didn't even wait for them to put the wet tyres...
Alonso is unbelievable
bring crofty
Who won?
I hate this commentator
Alonso must break any simulation’s predictions, just wow.
Nando p2, Sainz p5 I'm happy
So is red bull going to win every race this season?
1:41 trust no one, even yourself
Alonso. Nothing more to say
Best Grand Prix on the calendar, Best audience, Best atmosphere, The best of everything…and Max Verstappen is on the other level
Is not Formula 1, its let see Verstapen win...
If Max wasn’t in F1, Zandvoort was never a circuit in the program. Thanks Max for your skills and Prince Bernard jr. to make this old F1 race circuit alive.
Feel like there could be a 20 minute highlight with everything happening this race
Sargeant found out what a kilometer is😔
What happened with Leclerc?
Has Lando not learned from Russia? He so petulant 😡
All you people who is talking about alonso is better than Lewis u all jokes😂 not even max is better than lewis.
0:20 Fernando Alonso showing why he's still on the grid, even at an "advanced age".  A simply spectacular overtaking.
And they say there is no overtaking here...well??
4:26📻Darker ©️louds are coming in🏎️🏁 AWS🥷
Chadlonso
What's the point of the wet weather tyres
Fernando deserved more than 2 championships but unfortunately he took some bad decisions and had a lot of bad luck so he only has 2WDC but we all know he is one of the greatest (I'm fan of Max)
MAN Hamilton from 16  to 4th wow
This announcer is very annoying. I’ve been an F1 fan since long before drive to survive neon hair people came about and this announcer is a direct result of those type of fans. Cringey fake excitement. The result is watching highlights on mute or altogether skipping it and reading reviews on race calendar. Demoting brundle and crofty has made F1 less enjoyable.
With any doubt in my mind, Alonso is the best driver in the current paddock. He's just another level. If he had Max's Red Bull he would've lapped everyone in this race.
If the same team wins every race what’s the point? It’s a foregone conclusion! Boring.
man what a start, never senne this
Give that Alonso boy a Redbull. He got a future in him
McLaren and Mercedes made some questionable calls in the beginning. Had they pitted like most other teams I'd say the podium would've been very different.
Alonso mastercraft . He is his own engineer and strategist ,he predicted Lecrec result soon after the race.
FIA against Checo Pérez, Checo not only fights against hes own team (Red bull) but against all this mafia...
What a great drive by Alonso as always 😂 👏👏 simply incredible 👏💚, i hope he fights for championship next year, he truly deserves another championship 🏆Go Fernando Alonso 💚💚 Edited: i forgot to add that Alonso will again win the overtake of the month 🙌💚
😢how I missed the old F1, this is outrageous and boring
What a freaking awesome job for Lewis a great recovery. Keep it up legend Lewis 💜💜🐐🐐🐐👑
It'll be a more interesting season when the car max is driving is fkt on race day
That opening lap was crazy. It started almost completely dry, then as they rounded the final corner it looked as if a flood had just occurred
feels bad for yuki
Awesome race ....... LeClerc way overrated.
Zandvoort had it all this race
แม็กจะสร้างทุกสถิติต่อจากนี้
No matter what happens VER ends 1st and PER bottles it. Yes, I know RB has a favourite driver too. And that is for a very obvious reason.
Alonso an epitome of aged like fine wine
Alonso proved he is a great driver when he nearly won the WC with Ferrari twice when it was mid field car back in 2012 & 2013 . He should have more than 2 World Titles due to bad timings and decision when moving to another team.  He is 42 and still can compete, if he was driving the Red Bull now he be competing for the title against MV.
The people who keep comparing George with Lewis should be shamed of themselves... It's disrespectful to compare George to Lewis because he a had a few better finishes early in the season. Don't compare an average driver to the 7x world champ.. Please stop it.
Will be though if they take Zandvoort off the calendar tbh..
Wow 😮 I never saw a race like this one with so many pit stops 😮🎉🎉🎉
Alonso is faster than you
Man, the coverage for 5th and 6th place was riveting again. The rest, not so much.
This commentator is so obnoxious
This commentator shouts too much man
Why do the announcers scream and yell?
What is wrong with McLaren dude WHY DID THEY NOT PIT LANDO IN LAP 2
again Ferrari lost
THE GOAT CONTINUES HIS WIN STREAK 🐐🐐
No matter what chaos hit, I guess max cannot be stoppen
Best race of the season imo.
Alonso is the GOAT
Alonso… a driver whom I had little time for 6 years ago, now full of admiration. Class act and experience shines through; Aston Martin lucky to have him 👍
MAFIA
Just what I love, a screaming Brit announcer....... must take about two days to come down from that high...😅🤣
I know at least 5 guys on f1 23 game that will do better than Peres in that red bull in real race :D this is joke
What a drive gasly
i just won so much money thanks to this race
ALONSOOOOOOO!!!!
Zhou Guanyu wins the being overtaken award
Fernando, a joy to watch.
Quel pilote Alonso !! S'il avait eu des voitures performantes toutes ces années...On aurait eu des championnats plus intéressants. 🍾🍾
Truly an interesting race today, many great overtakes.
Why did they give Zhou mediums....?
McLaren: copy Red Bull car but Ferrari strategy calls
lonso is a breath of fresh air for f1 . .
Alonso has returned like a terminator
How he manage to stay on dry tires two laps more and dont lose nothing . My english is bad but this sport is worst..  Now it isnt about car. This is just unwatchable
A single mention of Lawson on his debut would’ve been nice.
how did leclerc get out?
Even the nature can't stop him!! The future GOAT 🔥🔥🔥
anyone else notice during recent race hightlights the commentators are video never show the ferrari mistakes or accidents?
I am so bored with Verstappen winning everything
Grande Nando Alonso... secondo me in Red bull...mmmmmmmm
Still think red bull are cheating !
well that was fun....
Alonso is worth every penny of the $50M he gets.
Somehow the most exciting conditions still leads to the most boring outcome. Is there any excitement left in race winnings in F1? I’ve not watched a single race this year, just highlights… Surely this is switching fans off.
I wonder if anyone left an Alonso comment?
Alonso just seems to pull everything from that Aston, phenominal driving.
How did max not get a penalty for pushing Gasly off seriously fia loves max so much its putting me off F1
Si Haminton no gana.. la formula 1 ya no tiene sentido.. si sigue asi dejare de verla
Alonso is the best
I don't think I like formula 1 anymore
Alonso is such a legend. And Max is driving on a level only comparable to Schumacher and Senna. We are witnessing F1 history with a driver like verstappen and it's happening right now!
Absolutely exciting GP,, however Mercedes and Ferrari we need to have a talk
This commentator really needs some meds to calm down. This yelling is really annoying at start.
What a shocker of a winner!!!
Sack the editor
No lo hubiera imaginado nunca. Gano verstapen.😂
The end was comical 😂😂😂
Super max 🔥
Ferrari and Mercedes downfall needs to be studied
Miss crofty
Where is Crofty??? Lights out and away we go????? :-(((
Yawn!
The relentless CARNIVAL BARKING commentary ruins this for me.
2:39 how tf is that not a penalty? The love the fia have for redbull couldn’t have been more obvious
How does Perez fumble it every time
I love how the highlights didnt even bat an eye at the red flag.
YewToob is getting worse - THREE ads on this eight-minute video! 😖
again the most boring period of my Sunday..........I'd rather put bamboo up the inside of my nails
Albon to get points in Monza
Fernando Alonso is the best driver of the season by far. What a man, what a driver, what a human being Badass. RBR once again sabotaging Sérgio Perez's race, could have won the race today. First they stopped Max before and undercut Checo, then they messed him up on purpose because they knew he would come back in front of Max
Amazing race Epic Indonesia 🇮🇩 fans
All those going of the track during the heavy rain could have been prevented if the drivers just put on the extreme wets.
Ferrari being so mid has to change
Lewis 14 seconds behind P19 to P6 is a very underrated drive. Amazing passes too. Why is no one talking about this?
Supeeer   Alonso.....❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Despite the winner being the same, it was definitely one of the more interesting races thanks to the weather.
El talón de Aquiles del gran piloto mexicano, la lluvia, las superficie mojada
What a joke of a red flag. Just get rid of wet tires if teams refuse to use them, and why did they red flag for 30 minutes when it should have been 5 minutes? Pathetic.
How did Leclerc go out? Why do the highlights always miss something major?
Alonso some much a better racer then Lewis.  Funny that Lewis is just an average driver in changing conditions... and Sky sports keeps on mentioning Lewis is a rainmaster, he gets exposed and exposed again.
If i bet i can't loose
If AM had 2 drivers they'd be doing amazing!
Alonso was just majestic out there in such horrendous conditions. If he didn't loose so much time I honestly believe he would've pipped Verstappen.
Poor - didn’t see Max take the lead
And the RB again drove a fantastic race, the auto pilot in the second RB had some issues though...
Ever since these F2 guys started commentary , I have lost all feel for the highlights. Bring back the old team of commentators.
Forgot to watch the race. Guess I’ve moved on to next year.
Fernando s driving on the wet , first laps..... Racing iq by far the best on the grid!
McLaren were shocking in pretty much everything, from decisions to "ability" to overtake.  They made Ferrari look like professionals today.
Norris is a looser
F1 is getting boring
Race starts here we go All 72 laps zzzzzz😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴💤💤😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴💤💤💤 Comentator here comes verstappen winner dash gp And race finish go home and prepare for next most entertaining and thrilling race. 🤣🤣
Why does anyone bother? 9 in a row says he's got an unattainable advantage compared to the rest of the field. With all of the meddling F1 has done over the past few decades to make things more competitive, it's just baffling that they would allow someone with a clearly superior machine to continue to just drive past everyone at will. This isn't a competition between drivers who are using strategy- it's just Max brute forcing his way through the field.
NO VOLVERÉ A VER UNA SOLA CARRERA. F1 igual a MAF1A
I’d say this was the best race of the year
Let's go Lewis 💜️
This felt a bit much cut down, I think it would be better to make the highlights a bit longer if neccessary
Very very happy for Alonso!
Alonso P2, Fastest lap and DOD!! 🐐
there should be a "meh" button along with the like and dislike button. Checo needs to leave his seat to a better driver. Lawson should keep the seat and Haas needs to sell the team ASAP!
No Russell save while he was in front of Hamilton? Highlights?
Max Max Max super Max
The rain just made thing very interesting love it
Chuva...pneus, e a vitória de Verstappen , claro!! Até vimos fogo de artifício no final...
Ferrari became finally a 4th racing team in F1 overall. They tried very hard to achive that, staying in first place wasn’t that much of a challenge anymore for them, so why not fighting for 10th? Great stuff. I would fire every single one of them, starting from the CEO.
walk in the park for max
I don't like verstapen's behaviours but in F1 currently he is the best
I'd liked to have seen Lewis & Lando at the end. Not sure if Lewis eased off but Lando finished just 0.023s behind.
Really happy for Fernando, way to go mate👏👏👏👏
Glad to see Alonso and AM back to the top 3
ferrarri bitmiş
I wonder who won
Alex Jacques did a phenomenal job on commentary today.
Buena imagen la del champán,que en una movida tan marciana como la f1,hay amistad y respeto
Why FIA supported  a fake winner as is Verstappen when everybody knows that his car have something else  to always win .I Saw it last year in Gran Premio de México 2022 . What a shame
Verstappen the best
No one talking about how Mercedes having the worst racing weekends in a long time ... Not because of bad luck but lacking ability to be up in the fighting positions
So boring to see only RB wins every GP
well done alonso
Alonso keeping F1 slightly interesting.
sergio perez es un pem dejho no sabe manejar las carreras y siempre pensamos que vertapen es el malo  ala bhergha  sergio  no sabe manejar estoy furioso
one of the best races this year
Mediocre ferrari
Alphatauri strategists are on a different level. It takes a special kind of effort to mess up someone's race that bad, maybe it's an Italian thing. Justice for Yuki
Perez vs Max, the other 18 drivers and against his own team.... RB always talks about treating both drivers equally, time has only shown that this is not true.
Boring Boring man race
Worst sport ever. So boring
This is the only way to watch these races now. The race highlights save me from wasting 90ish minutes to see the same person win.
Fernando shouldve pitted in the first lap. He couldve won the race
Joke of a sport sort your rules out 😊
Brawo Fernando!!!!❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
Verstappens pass on gasły lap 6, did he not push him off the track? How is there no penalty for that
Race of the season so far and what a great track 🤩🤩🤩
What a race. Lots of twists and turns, and ups and downs.
Very very uncompetitive sport
I’m so tired of Perez. Utter disappointment. My fav driver but it’s hard to win when you’re Max’s wingman
Bravo lewis... start in 13... go to 20 and come in 16 then 6... GET IN THERE LEWIS... im soo sorry 😞 for George... but I'm happy 😊 to lewis. Well-done max for 9 win in the row
i dont see many comments appreciating what was an absolute mega recovery drive from p13-p20-p6 by lewis. absolutely magnificent
Amazing 1 race in 2007 is all it took to still have Alonso haters deny this guys talent. Give him a Red Bull and see whats up..
Disaster for Ferrari,with every race Ferrari become the most stupidest team in all history of f1
what happened to Leclerc?
Alonso 🔥
Boring
What if RedBull signs Alonso for 2024 , imagine the fight would be amazing 😱
Perez is a dumpster fire. dude just can't do anything well anymore. dude just can't settle for being a solid 2nd driver.
gasly should have pushed max on the overtake in turn 3. got pushed off on a risky overtake. next time put those elbows out. cant be pushing other racers off the track
Is F1's channel deleting comments where people are criticizing the red flag situation today? Can't find one, says a lot about where we're heading...
You can’t overtake in Zandvoort…..
I love how Max will break every single record from Lewis Wokelton.
Knew it was a reason I didn't watch this trash today.
today max just broke one of the most challangeing record of all time and no one is talking about his insane pace and consistency            congrats max
Great work from Liam Lawson. Perez should be worried.
new score board is pastige, like a 10 yrs old fan of old f1 design was signed for it
The only race I forget to watch and it was so exciting.
Alonso !!!mama mia !!!!
Arlando Fernondo ❤
Norris probably had slight PTSD from Sochi 2021 when the rain started lap 2.
Where's David Croft's commentary highlights?
The best race so far
Boring 😔
scamilton ...
The best drivers in the world, the best cars in the world, the best tires in the world. It rains so better red flag it becuause this series is a joke
Why is red bull tuning down Perez engine. Give him same power and let them race
It's not even a race, no more
Hysterical commentary. Those guys are going to die from high blood pressure.
One of the worst highlights I have ever seen. So much action not shown
Adesso forse di apripista forse chi.?
Crazy race.
F1 HONDA RedBull racismos contra mexicanos
Highlights did not do justice to the actual race.  This race was absolutely nuts.
Alonso still got it! He is simply....amazing!
Impressed with Lawson in such insane race oscillations
No gomme, ma' apripista !
Its wild how no team looked at the weather and said start with inters
bruh max has already won the chamionship
My today drivers: Max, Alonso, Albon, Gasly ❤
Yay Alonso😊
For those who kept saying Russel was outplaying Hamilton ...
F1 HONDA RedBull racismos contra mexicanos
Take a drink every time you hear "Fernando Alonso" and "using all that experience" in the same sentence.
F1 ravismo
Liam beat Yuki in his first F1 race 😱
I haven't been following the f1 stuff for a bit now, what happened to David Croft and Martin Brundle Commentating?
Sargeant is the new latifi!
Im not enjoying this sport anymore bye boys
Verstappen should have a penalty when he passed Gasly
Wondering why Verstappen didn't get pinged for his pass on that amazing left hander where he pushed the other car off really.  Anybody else would have ...
Alonso 🐐
よく8分にまとめたなw
Wow, what a race. And absolute masterclass from Fernando. He must have enjoyed that one.
Poor yuki
This is the first time to see this gap between 1st and 2nd (138 ) point
A warm welcome to Gasly, the newest guest in the Verstappen Podcast
Only *_LUCK_* that makes Gasly up into podium.
Happy I didn't watch another boring RB win live and just the highlights
Another amazing race for the rich kid from Montecarlo 😂 what a joke
Great Circus today FIA jajajaja, the weather give us 2 shows, everything for max win this prix?
What a sensational drive from Fernando Alonso!!!!! Congratulations to Pierre Gasly as well!
Someone get Albon in a better car
Increible, Alonso! Incroiyable
and I’m bored, again.
At the four-minute mark, Sergeant says something fell on the right front!? What a lame thing to say knowing that the right front is damaged and there's no way that they can dispute what he said when in fact he just lost control ¿`_
Verstappen sensacional!
Alonso>>>grid
And everything goes back where we started. RedBull and Alonso.
Logan Sargeant.🤦🏾‍♂️
💯🔥👍 rain makes racing more entertaining every time.
The Flying Dutchman to the MAX SuperMax!
Alonso ❤
deja vu of norris at sochi 2021
Come on gasley....🚀🚀🚀
Que pereza ganando red bull. Se perdio la emocion. Lo bueno seria en cada carrera un ganador diferente y deberian quitar DRS. Asi seria mas emocionante
I have a brand new Ferrari jersey for sale, unused! Any takers?
Albono!
Alonso : eres el más grande!
Pls get rid of these commentators
great race today for max , Alonso
ワーウィックとかいう粗大ゴミを解雇しろ
Bro yo que soy checo lover y sufri toda la carrera fue inevitable no disfrutarla. Lo que estaba aguantando yuki, Albon en modo supervivencia a prueba de todo, el capitan america que lo estaba haciendo bien, el debutante Lawson sobreviviendo a tal primera carrera. Alonso regalandonos a pleno muestra de su clase, y Pierre gasly sacando un bien merecido podio. Bro... cuando perez estuvo lider, Max recortaba casi que un segundo por curva Jajajaj,impresionante. Pero el highlight del día sin duda fue Zhou en segunda posición. Vaya carrera!!!! Esto sí es fórmula uno.     Aunque a mitad de carrera estuvo un poco aburrida, quizás por la locura que fue el inicio y el final a comparación.
Don't watch F1 as often nowdays but seeing Alonso blast it really took me back to my childhood. What a spectacular driver.
There doesnt seem to be any footage of the contact between Norris and Russell
Mute.  Yay.
I pray that this isn't the last chaotic race this year in which Nando has a chance for the win. He has been so painfully close every given opportunity this season but comes up just short.
Race where nothing happens: 8 min This race: also 8 mins
Moment of the race - George asking what happened since he was "forecasted" to finish in the podium 🤣
And Perez once again shows how pathetic of a driver he is 😂 Get rid of him asap, please. He belongs to go-karting.
Oh pipe down Mr Bigmouth announcer.
Perez is such a disappointment
alonso have to be in a ferrari or mercedes
What a race weekend for Lawson to debut in F1.  Too bad the for the rolling restart considering what happened in F2 yesterday.
Jajajajajaja Jajajajajaja Jajajajajaja Jajajajajaja Jajajajajaja Jajajajajaja Jajajajajaja Jajajajajaja Jajajajajaja Jajajajajaja Jajajajajaja Jajajajajaja Jajajajajaja siempre protegiendo, a los europeos, cuanto clasismo, ojalá y así como penalizan menosprecian, a checo fuera con todos, típico de los clasistas.
The best race in a long time
Alonso finds racing lines nobody else can. What a legend
Great debut for Lawson
Why penalty points?
To netherlands: your croud was insane! And Max of corse a beast! Thanks for this awesome GP! Greetings from germany.
Alonso n1
There should be a Max Verstappen factor adjustment. The race for second is the real race in F1 and has been for three years now. Alonso showing he’s the best of the rest right now. Love to see the old dog still has teeth and fight.
Brundle, retire man
Max winning boring F1
Can someone tell the bloke who screams all the time to pull his head in ?
Por que o Perez não abriu distância ao ponto de não ser alcançado?
This is the kind of race I wish they had extended highlights for. Like they didn't show how gasly improved so much
Great race but these guys they have save the checkered do it with no emotion lol
this could of been such a great season
A corrida , apesar de termos o mesmo vencedor , foi muito emocionante e movimentada ! Gostei muito - a disputa do segundo lugar pra baixo está muito emocionante!
Love this crazy race. So unpredictable
The Dutch are such a contrast compared to the grumpy British, this is why the Dutch always beats them (also 2-1 Netherlands vs England in hockey final today).
Grande ALONSO. Has estado muy cerca
What is the point have extreme wets if you wont let them race in them. The results could have been so different if they all had to pit ocon would have been on the podium 😂
Again they fotgot about full wet tyres
fernando alonsooooo what a comeback
Redbull messed up checos race.  Its really sad they do that. He was in the lead and they allowed max to undercut him. Its obvious by the strategy they did whatver they could to help max win. It was disrespectful,  maybe if perez was european or white hed have more respect.
what a boring championship, only one  pilot wnis... =/
Doesn't mathers the conditions, Super Max is too strong.
Shame max won
BORING track, boring season.
Dude stop yelling
Sergeant Leclerc and Zhou DNF
Alonso, raining wet track expert
Max Home win
Ladies and gentlemen... Max verstappen   Awaits team LH meltdown 😂😂
This race will go as one of the best Alonso performances ever 🐐
What a race . Wow i'm really bias toawrd Alonso and Albon but what a racecraft from both  of them.
I see McLaren using the same strategy as Ferrari 🤦‍♂️
great drive from Fernando and Lewis
It's now officially reaching delusion territory for people who don't think Max is the best driver on the grid
fernando alonso exceptional....! pierre gasley not bad either....!  perez and norris under performing....
Please guys BRING BACK CROFTY …
F1 is boring
F1 tá tão chata que eu preferir dormir, do que assistir
What happened Leclerc ?
Most exciting race of the entire season! 😊
It’s becoming boring now. Atleast Rosberg was fighting with Lewis. Heck they even crashed. Next race its Max again I’m guessing.
So predictable...
Sargeant just go back to US and circle racing
pierre we're exited for what you could do, this race was unbelievable. yuki, carlos, alonso, alex so many memorable performances
Gasly in points alonso another podium this season and Liam Lawson with a great debut
Alonso, you are the best driver, no doubts!
It's amazing how max can make a pit stop in any condition could be a fire a flood meteor shower the end of the world, he is the only man that can make a pit stop and Not Lose Position.
Top bom demais!
What an amazing come back from Fernando! I enjoyed this race like a kid *_*
F1 is boring, I’m moving to indycar
Its crazy that even when opportunities from the rain gods present themselves, Mercedes & its drivers are so flat footed strategy wise that they do not gamble & take risks, they are so conservative! What do you have to lose when you are no 12 on the grid! They lost an opportunity to be the first on intermediates! 🙄🤔
Feel for tsunoda. Absolutely deserved some points
Formula 1 is not sport, who have the best machine, let's go win
I empathized with Logan Sargeant today. He’s a remarkable young person from a wonderful family. I recall watching his uncle, Sgt. Slaughter, in the WWF during the late 80s and early 90s.
theres no point in having  full wet tyres ,if they keep pulling red flags.just leave it to the saftey car.
What a F1 debut from Liam Lawson, bringing his car home in P13! The TV cameras almost didn't notice that he was in the race, but this is like an award, because this means that he wasn't involved in any incidents. He just did a very solid job on a challenging track and in challenging conditions. Perez and Ricciardo probably won't be happy about that!
Red Bull is making F1 boring.
That redbull is incredibly fast, it's literally in a different league and is stable across do many tracks
Nobody talking about how Zhou was 2nd for a little bit. Crazy!
Perez: how to go from zero to hero..........     And again to the zero🥲🥲🥲
Wait, so perez pit stop didin't count because you let him be on p3 at the restart, but he still got penalty because of that stop ??? I mean, I'm happy for gasly, but yeah
Perez is a piece of sh$t….virtual safety car n he put so much gap between himself n Alonso…green light, still so much space n Alonso no pressure n go all out on max.
So nice to see a clean start to a race. Satisfaction. 🎉
Albon did the impossible, Alonso is at his prime all these years
Easy win for max….surprise surprise…
It's lights out and away we go and Verstappen wins the Dutch Grand Prix!
Full marks to Max with such terrible changing conditions managed to stay completely focussed throughout.
We need a Separate series for Ferrari in Netflix this year 😅
Fernando alonso on podium, alex albon catching up in a WILLIAMS, ALFA ROMEO IN P2? WHATS GOING ON!?!?!?
Highlights are trash
well its clear perez is 2nd driver
Wheres the old commentator?
Why not show the Ferrari 1st stop XD
Who else is tired of Max winning?
Great Race
Verstappen passing Gasly shows that he's still the kind of driver who shoves his opponents off track
The races are worth watching for podium finishes!  P1 is always a guarantee these days for verstappen 😅😅😅😅
The Master Legend Alonso
Man... Aston Martin seems to have only 1 driver...
PEREZ .... POBRE TIPO QUE MALA SUERTE TIENE
Without rain interupption Albon scored more points..And Alonso is like a fine wine and Happy For gasly finally he showed his potential
So, why do they bother saying they have full wet tyres if they're never going to use them?
Maxs dive bombs are a joke. I’d stay on the track and just let him hit me. People see it’s him and move out the way
Norris and Piastri 2 new clowns of Formula 1 2023 😂
Aston Martin NEED to get rid of Lance Stroll. The FIA need to bring in a paid driver rule that if they fall short compared to other drivers who could fill that seat better, they have to go
Only two words yeah nah  Max bruv
honda f1 top
Unlucky Hamilton, so close lol
Alonso was pure magic today😊 Roll on Sunday for Max to make history
Go red bull ! Eat all 2023 races!!
le clerc will take pole in monza
Vamossssss alonso piloto legendario en pista apartar de vextapen ganador pero que pilotooo alonso me siento orgulloso de este piloto incansable
Happy for Fernando and especially Pierre 👏🏾🚀🚀🚀
It was so obvious red bull wanted max to win and make it consecutive wins...making decision for the p2 driver before the leader?...come on...this is a joke🤣🤣... so obvious christian horner and Helmut will do everything to make max win...say whatever you want...those 2 cars are not the same
Estamos assistindo corridas de onibus os carros estao muito grandes  que desastre ultrapassagens artificiais com asa móvel que saudade da era Schumacher 😩
The amount of times TV Crew switched Ocon and Gasly is .. maybe 4. Not much to care enough but weird it happened that much. Including the podium ceremony.
All Dutch GP videos on this channel are "unavailable" here in NYC. Is there a reason or a glitch?
This race was managed by Derek Warwick a.k.a Tsunoda killer. He focus on ruining Yuki's career in this season.
IT’S PITIFUL THE WAY RED BULL TREATS SERGIO PEREZ. THEY’RE ALWAYS FAVORING MAX
He also broke the record of the gp 🔥
Who wouldn't have thought these new regulations would "lead to closer racing", considering the chief technical officer of the FIA was banned for race fixing. Stand up job all round🖕🏻
Lol @ Perez
Yo no sé qué tiene el RB 19,pero el coche de Checo no es igual que el de Max,Alonso es un 👽 nacido en Asturias.14❤
Great comeback from Lewis despite the terrible strategy
I say again that it would be a great idea to have signal lights on the front of the cars too, just as it is on the back, those in front have the view of the rear view mirror obstructed by the spray of water. I'm not saying that there will always be accidents because of this, but it's something more for safety on the track
The most boring season in history, I wonder what brought me to f1
3:00 lap 7, gap to Perez 11s 3:05 lap 11, gap to Perez 3s 💀
F1 is the most overhyped-rated racing in the world. $ 1,500 USD per seat per day to watch the pole sitter win by such a large margin. Push to pass because it is boring, mandating tire changes to force a pit stop. The pre-race and post-race festivities are the most excitement all day. The cars travel so fast, depending on where you are sitting, it is hard to know who just went by. Baseball caps at the Sovenier stand $90 to $110, a shirt $100 tp $125, pop up Ferrari champaign stands,
Finally we get a great race this year!     Although, of course, Max is the one constant.
How boring! I wish to see the races where everyone won a race in the season, not only Max. I mean, happy him, he is strong, Netherlands is his country, but it's boring to watch all the race if u alr know whos gonna win.
RB making sure Checo not to win. Oh well.
Best race I have been too
Entreguenle mejor el csmpeonato a max
hahahaha the maFIA gave Pérez a 5 second penalty for running in the pitlane and tsunoda also for forcing another driver off the track and where is the penalty for verstappen? he did the same thing as tsunoda forced gasly off the track and they didn't sanction him anyway, just the maFIA 😂😂😂
cheatstappen cheats again is not a surprise
0:18 0:21 0:23
Lando should have pitted as soon as it started raining. He lost momentum and was unable to get back in the swing of things.
Here's a joke:    *_Wet tires_*
Verstappen playing driver career in F1 23 tho😅
Hamilton did well considering his starting position.
Verstappen bore fest again, yawn
I
how is logan still on the grid?
Alonso colocou as 2 Ferrari n bolso😂😂😂😂
Alonso is a boring Guy, but a great driver. He deserves a Win before he retires
Pure class from FA!! SP is back! Well done LH for not crashing into anyone!
I retired to early - Kimi
Great effort from Aston Martin and Fernando Alonso Soooo Close to a win, onward and upward Fernando
These races are so boring
What a performance from Fernando Alonso. I also thought that the Mercedes pace today was very very impressive. Was p16 and p18 and both finished top 10. Also was quicker than both mclaren drivers which is hard recently maybe without mistakes at the start mercedes were well in the fight behind max today.
Best race of the season.  Great performance by Alonso and Gasly
Alonso. Goat
Fernando pure GOAT
2.38 how isn’t that unsafe from Verstappen? Forces Gasly off the track?
Great recovery drive from Lewis, unlucky for Russell.
Props to Yuki defending his position for so long just to lose the race 😢
Congrat 4 Alonso 👍
Damed!!!! so close of the pódium again Sergio P.!!!! 😮😲🤔😐🙂👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
And once again ... FIA awarding an undeserved win for Cheat-stappen... LAME ... Why don't we save the plots and give already the Championship to boy-toy Maxie..??? And shame on you if you think he's winning because of his superhuman habilities....
Rb dont stop of doing bs to perez...
Can someone explain to me why Wets exist, when whenever they re needed the race is stopped?
Alpine won a podium after Otmar left😂.
In these races, under these adverse weather conditions, Alonso reminds me of Senna. As for Verstappen, masterful, in his own league.
The verstappen show continues
Mercedes trying to copy ferrari's stupidity in strategies? -.-
Nahh. Nobody care. We need justice for 2021
Russell is a clumsy fool.
Summary --> 7:31
why do they have full wets if they red flag every time the rain enters the window
Alonso is such a joy to watch. Amazing
yes alonsooo
give the other redbull to alonso  he'll give max run for his money.
THIS COMMENTATOR AGAIN?!?!?! WHY?!?!?! HIS VOICE SOUNDS LIKE 2 BALOONS RUBBING TOGETHER!! WHY CANT CROFTY AND BRUNDLE'S COMMENTRY BE USED!?!?!?!?
VERSTAPPEN THE NEW WORLD RECORD CHAMPION MAN !
Snooooozzzxx
Alonso and Max have more raw talent than any other F1 drivers over the past 25 years.  Try to fathom a straight up fight in equal equipment between those two.  Mind crashing.  Now that Danny Ric has run out of talent again, and won't even race for a while, Albon needs to be considered for a top ride.  There's no better small team driver in F1 right now than Albon.
Mercedes pulling Ferrari strats now.
Alonso gives it everything this season! What a man 🔥
LOL at the announcer yelling to try to make this silliness seem important. What a big boring joke, and waste.
THE Rain was playing with the race
Alonso ,Perez congratulations 🥳🏎️🏁
What was that? What a race
I find it rather convenient that red bull was the only team on full wet tires when they red flagged ( occon doesn’t count), and everyone else was on inters already.  But race control let them switch back to inters before restarting the race so they wouldn’t be at a potential disadvantage.  I can’t think of any reason other than Christian Horner making a stink, for race control mandating all teams be on inters when everyone else was already on them.
Bien checo
MAX !!!  How about Fernando heh ? If only he had a top car....
a brief summary: It rained... you can guess who won
increadible race, very dissapointed with the strategy coming from mclaren, Norris was set to be on the podium but they kept him out way too long
Rus was holding it down but hey Ham got us in 4th 🤷🏽‍♂️
Max lowkey should’ve got a penalty for forcing gasly wide like that
Russell's save in front of Hamilton should be included. 1 of the best saves I've ever seen
Enorme Alonso
Alonso Driver of the Day
It's me or race coverage has avoided showing Alonso at all cost during the last 3 races?
leclerc are really nothing to lose anymore, not even try LOL, sad scudaria
This was a very fun race in a while
Hamilton showing he can make the difference.  Well done Lewis 🇨🇭
please bring back crofty for these highlight videos
Pierre and Yuki, where is the difference...
stop shouting.
Alonso definitely my favorite driver by far
Love to see that McLaren learned nothing from Sochi '21, deciding not to stop on Lap 3, and then stopping anyway like 3 laps later because it got too bad and dropping like 10 positions.
Verstappen taking 8 rounds to close a 14 second gap to his teammate in the same car on the same tyres is absolutely amazing
Booorfuckinging
See you again, Formula One 2024. This season has been worthless to watch.
Remember Leclerc ?
6:04 Perez out the road lap 63 7:37
I loved sainz vs hamilton last laps
Again AlphaTauri letting down Yuki. The strategy man, it’s so bad
Max Verstappen 9 wins in à row,super spectacle ,congratulations Max and team 🥳🏆🏁🏎️🔥
Alonso is a legend
Props to Fernando Alonso winning the Dutch F1.5 GP
IT'S UNFAIR THAT ALONSO HAS 2 CHAMPIONSHIPS ONLY, SOMEONE GIVE THIS MAN THE REDBULL SEAT
🇳🇱 🎉
Haha.. Red Bull making that bañar cryer vertipan a champion.. no way his better than Perez with the same car obviously no the same performance in the cars!! So sad ..
wow hamilton is tumbling down that leader board!
Its getting boring....perez is like driving alpha tauri...great machine for a wrong driver...and vice versa
Wow, Alpine performing decent now while Otmar is out. What a coincidence!
So, no one’s gonna talk about Hamilton?
so boring, Verstappen again zzzz
McLaren wasted the 2nd best car on the grid with bad strategy..So disappointing
Lets them race, stop using the safety car!!
Never a red flag. Early stoppage.
Ferrari never fails to disappoint
These highlights are not highlights at all, so much action was missed
Huge respect to Liam Lawson for finishing on his F1 debut under these ungodly conditions.
PLEASE PLEASE make a segment that is just highlighting what happened after the red flag. So many countries TV changed programming due to time constraints. We didn’t get the finish of the race!
Thank you very much for this bizarre and amazing race, Holland 🇳🇱 ❤
Nobody can deny Max' achievements. 9 race wins in a row, you don't get that just for being in the fastest car, you need to be the best driver, too.
Poor Tsunoda not only got a 3 grid spot penalty but another one during the race and Sainz gets off scot free for running Piastri of the track in quilifing
What a cool track!
Yet again Max proves he’s the GOAT
I loved the part where Max Verstappen said "It's Verstappening time" and Verstappened all over the grid.
what happened to leclerc?
Max no lo quiere a ocon jajaja
Logan’s career in F1 is over, Mercedes have completely imploded, Max is embarrassing a grid in the most dominant season in history, Alonso is just always there and who doesn’t love hearing Gasly shout on the radio for a podium!
Alonso mantaap
EL PLAN !!!!!!!
Alonso what a superb driver..
excluding Max from the competition, what an exciting race!! i learnt to forget about Max and imagine that the positions starts from 2nd haha
Get rid of that commentator asap
Vax Pushers
why does this caster sound like its been ai generated?
Even with Williams bottling the pit calls twice today, Alex still finishes in P7. Russell retired late, but Alex was still there on merit, which is pretty astonishing. I don't know how much the recent upgrades improved the car, but his pace was far better than anyone expected. Way to go, Alex.  I hope Williams continues to improve and Alex stays with the team. The rumor mill says Alex is talking with Aston and Ferrari, but I think he might be better off staying where he is.
Super max❤❤
Ferrari absolutely pathetic once again
More brilliant driving from the Ancient Spaniard.
Someone accidentally turned on randomizer gamemode for this race
Boring
Ahh!!! Was really hoping for Alonso to win this one
As a Ricciardo & Gasly fanboy I’m beyond thrilled with him finishing 3rd, but Alonso doing Alonso things to finish 2nd & Max embarrassing everyone to win again made this a fantastic race. It’s weird to think the last race Max didn’t win was back in April.
The commentary man...... like a kid who's had a bag of skittles
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
Note to announcer: monsoon does not mean heavy rain, monsoon is a seasonal wind that brings either wet or dry conditions.... Monsoon isn't the storm, monsoon IS the season.
Williams fighting Ferarri and Merc, what a drive from Alexander Albono!
ALONSO ROOKIE OF YEAR
The first image is misleading, I opened the video because I was expecting a ferrari fighting against a red bull but in fact there are no ferrari
Well done Max. Welcome to the First Podium Gasly in F1 2023 season. I like singing Anthem 👍🙂.
This Dutch kid has a big future
If Max and Fernando swapped cars at this point in the championship Fernando would smoke him 💨
Boooooorrrriiiiiinnnngggg
Super Max ❤
1:43 Fernando Alonso going past Fernando Alonso 🤣🤣
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, THANK YOU RAIN
Poor Checo, RB contrived to hand that to Max by deliberately leaving Checo on the inters so long...
This race was fire
Why do full wets exist?
After that whole mess, you thought FINALLY someone else would win besides Mad Max. Nope. Dang!
Thank you The Netherlands this was a great race.
Please, Red Bull, put Alonso in the car next to Max next year!🙏
Lweis Hamilton quietly moving to 4th overall 🤫😲
I cannot stand this guys voice I have to watch theese muted
Best race of the season
Even with Mix Condition. Max still wins. Checo made two mistakes. Spin at turn 1. So Alonso overtook him. Speeding at pitline. Gasly got podium. Ferrari made right call to let Saiinz overtook Leclerc. But still messed up with pitstop. Sometimes Tsunoda become Albon. Defend against Norris and Hamilton. Albon carried Williams by himself. Alonso back to podium after bed at few race. Mclaren was messed up at first pitstop.
Yeah.... like lulu said... he will finish the season in 2nd place stamdings.....   I dunno what tripy chemical I need to be on to see that one lol...
you didn't show what happened to LeClerc?
2:40 typical max 😂 "let me pass or we both crash"
Hamilton, gasly, nando and albon made this race a joy to watch
Perez have a penalty?
Shoutout McLaren for the worst strategy I’ve seen, didn’t even have one of their drivers pit in the first 3 laps. Lando could’ve been easy podium
Magicalonso
Mclaren copium is almost running out
Worst GP conditions. Horrible
Ahh the race strategy from Ferrari and Merc never are disappointed.🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️🤦🏼‍♂️
Lawson passing Leclerc was the best thing I Saw on that race
🚥🏎️🏁🍀👌
Honestly a great race
I better not see any Yuki slander, especially from Lawson, British, Australian, and Kiwi fans who are gaslighting themselves into thinking Lawson is already ahead of Yuki's level.  Don't get me wrong, Liam did a GREAT job on his 1st race with very little preparation or notice. He did a great job all things considered but that nothing in that race warranted any Yuki slander.  To those who only look at the final classification without watching the race, here is some context for you.  -Yuki was in the top 10 for some 80% of the entire race -He gave a defending masterclass against Norris and Hamilton on a tractor when he was P8 on much older tyres -Was left out to dry by his strategists by leaving him with 50 year old tyres when everyone was pitting for fresh tyres because his strategists wrongly gambled for rain that was far too out. -He was harshly penalized for little contact with Russell, while Norris with similar contact that eventually forced Russell to retire was unpunished. -Liam was a lap down for at least 90% of the race, he was able to unlap himself due to the restart. -Yuki would have finished P13 ahead of Lawson, but the 5sec penalty dropped him to P16  Liam did great, but he was never ahead of Yuki despite how the final classification might deceive you.  Let's just say both drivers did great but the team let them down.
Alonso is BACK!
Mercedes made completely a mess in this race
Literally ignore Max and this is one of the most interesting and competitive seasons ever, many teams and drivers battling for high scoring positions
Hamilton really lost his mojo...😪😪😪
Awesome camera angels awesome commentary, love F1.
F1 is offically boring AF this year
Verstappen: Now NO ONE’S GONNA STOP MEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Verstappen being Verstappen 2:37, pushing Gasly off
Not a big fan of verstappen  but  Once he started  winning it didnt stop.. he keeps winning n it feels like noone can beat him for  now.. it was same feeling  with hamilton also..whatever the condn they win ...champions dont let up they win win win.
boring ahh race tbh there's nothing ever happening at the front...
Charle's Ferrari retired out of embarrassment from being passed by a AlphaTauri.
Htf did Perez lose 4 seconds on Max just from Lap 55 to 56?
Liam Lawson had such a chaotic first f1 race and still managed to finish p13 despite the conditions. props to him for driving so well.
How come no penalty for MV when pushing Gasly out of track on lap 6 ? F1 is becoming a total disgrace ! Alonso is the true winner of this race
What happened to Leclerc? It was left out of the highlights.
why didnt you include details as to why Leclerc was out in the highlights???
best race of the season
If someone pulled the same overtake max did on Gasly to max, it'll probably have ended in a DNF
Best weekend so far in this season. Challenging quali with 6 teams in top 6 and a tough race with various incedents🔥
So the full wet weather tyre were created for full wet but as soon as the wet weather came it bcame a safety car condition?.??????????
The skill gap between Alonso and Stroll is comical.
GO ALONSO GO - I'm enjoying it.
cLoSeR rAcInG.
Nobody needs to watch it. The winner is always the same, from the beginning to the end of every single season. How boring is that?
Verstappen: " Man, give me some better opponents, I'm tired of being on pole for the 9th time in a row"
Max win means nothing to me because that RB is such a rocketship it's like Ferrari in 2003,2004. If AMR get things working next year 2024 Alo could be ending Max's win streak like he challenged and defeated Michael in 05.
Races in rain are my favorite. So much unpredictability and opportunity for mid field to get in the spotlight
I don't like Red Bull, still have to admit that Max and his team execution is near perfection.
Another boring race!
They didn't show anything in highlights. This race had everything in it. 😭😭
Alonso andVerstappen...the masters at work.....
The commentator 😭can't stop crying.... Annoying voice 😢
Wow verstappen win didn’t see that coming
Another show for ferrari 😂😂
Feel so bad for Norris. Should've pitted.
GASLY ON THE PODIUM!!!! 💙💙💙🤩🤩
It's a madness 😳
McLaren and bad luck is a match in heaven.
Frrrafi che pietà 😅😅
No crashes 1st corner is crazy tbh
Surprising that no teams picked the rain at the start. Especially Mercedes with Hamilton with not much to lose by taking the risk?🤔
Max is the greatest of all time 🇳🇱🔥
Whooooo Alonso!!
I’m so sick of red bull winning and LecLerc having the worst of luck 😭
What happened to Leclerc? Did he get into an accident?
Esse ano a Formula 1 está sem graça,  os carro da RBR estão fora do normal. Não quero mais assistir!
I drove the Alpine A110 last week and it was a blast...so i'm happy for Alpine
Alonso showing us race by race why he's the goat.
Alonso with his experience doin crazy stuff at the early of the race, what a drive
We all know who's gonna win the races. I just look forward to what Alonso's gonna do each race.
Dutch people still stays even in rain we are real fans
Thank you Ferrari for once again giving your best driver a broken car again.....  we get it, you hate him. Just let him go to a proper team like Aston then....
This is that kind of conditions where the best drivers show up.... Alonso and Max are the best (by far) of actual grid.... the rest is at average level...
ALONSO!! Way to go Albon in 8th place!
Verstappen just dropped one of the coldest celebration 9 straight wins he is him!🥶🥶
Another boring race.
Whoah slow the replay rate down! The clips were over before I could get a feel for lap, order, cars etc!

Ex Red Bulls drivers are amused
i miss croftys commentary on this channel :(
Twenty years of watching F1 and Alonso never disappoints. I wish every F1 driver such a career....
Perez showed what a World Champion he is.
Rain races used to be the most exciting. Now everybody calls for a safety car instead of just changing to the proper tires.
What an amazing race!!!!! Just everything you want in a race!
gasly did well by leaving alpha trashi
Oh Ferrari!! Leclerc's first pit stop was hilarious, no inter tyres 😂
It's a shame they don't race in full wet conditions.
perez 😂😂😂😂😂
Looks like I missed a great race man...crazy 😂
I would guess Carlos Sainz will finish 5th in every race going forward. Consistently mid.
Those Aston Martin's upgrades after Canada were actually downgrades. Now they seem to be back.
Grats Señor Alonso 🎉
Perez faster in the pitlane, than out on track.. as usual 🤦🏻‍♂️
GASLY YEEEEES!!!
They left my boy Yuki out to dry
1:32 that's gotta be the longest Pitstop, i've ever seen.
What a champ
Grande Fernando. Gutted with Ferrari once again; that first pitstop on Charles. Mercedes could have done better had they not messed up at start. Once again, Pierre, Esteban, Alex, Oscar and Lando gave us beautiful moments. Alpha Tauri took a risk with Yuki, it didn't happen, but Yuki gave it his best.  I've been criticized before for this, nevertheless Yuki is amazing.
Why did you guys remove the previous video With the nice intro
Alonso fantastic race . I really want him to win a race this season.....
As always Norris  bottling it he’s the most overrated driver he is bottom 4 driver
Zzzzz
Imagine if Fernando pitted on lap 2 like Pérez.... Just imagine
If you ever feel useless, remember that F1 has extreme wet weather tires
Every race day - Wake up ,watch verstappen win , sleep in joy 🤣😂
Fernando not having 5 or 6 tittles is truly a shame, but he’ll be remembered as an all time great that’s a fact! What a talent what a driver!
Does he really have to shout all the time? We kind of get it.
Fernando Alonso, put him in RB and he takes P1 on leaerboard
I still don't understand what happened to Russell to take him out.
Even the rain won't change a boring result
Awesome race but so frustrated for Albon. He could have been 3rd or 4th but Williams bottled the pit stop strategy not once but twice!
ALONSO MASTERCLASS
GASLYYYYY
Thank you! But PLEASE load up in 4K.
My grandma used to live on the 5th floor of the apartment building overlooking the circuit. Such a poor decision by my family to sell it when she moved to a full-time care-facility.
Max looks unbeatable
Alonso is truly one of the greatest drivers ever
Lewis showed some w2w skills. He entertained the boring part of the race
I started the video, skipped to the end after one second, and figured out all I needed to know
Fernando Alonso is the greatest driver since Schumacher. Deserves DOTD.
Nowadays I just watch F1 to see who comes in 2nd and 3rd
My man Nando still competitive at 42 years old
Congrats to Alonso, love seeing him on the podium.
Can’t believe max won!!!
🧡🤦
I miss it's lights out and away we go 😭
BORING 👎👎👎
All this started when F1 BANNED Mercedes DAS Steering wheel. THEN gave Mercedes THE LEAST TUNNEL TIME to make up for the fact that they won that year. F1 put their thumb on the scale. They also helped Max beat Lewis in his first F1 title using the stewards. Who are MIRACULOUSLY SILENT, now that Max is winning.
I'm so happy for Gasly today. So much bad luck this year. Finally he gets what he deserves
FERNANDO Drove like Monster today!
What are the full wet tyres even for if the red flag will be brought out before you even try them out?
This commentator is over the top - listening muted  better with out His noise pollution
Wonders by Alonso and Gasly 🎉
Could we put it to rest once and for all, the fact that Redbull are deliberately undermining Perez or are we still going to keep pretending like there's nothing to see here?
Now max prooved this victory again iits 80 %max and 20%the car
Normally Zandvoort is boring to watch, but this one is so AMAZING!!!
Thank goodness Bottas didn't end up colliding with his already crashed teammate.
categoría que ya se torno muy pero muy aburrida 😒 💤😴
Ridicolous circuit...!
I didn't watch the race but I happened to catch the result. It said Verstappen won, so I can now avoid watching the highlights. From now on I will look at the race results before I watch the highlights, and if I see his name in first place I know it will be a boring precession. I see it rained in this race but that's not enough to get me to watch F1 any more.
What a fantastic race 🎉🎉🎉 Alonso is sooooo good
B  O R I N G
Who cares?
Why bother with the extreme wet tyre option if they just red flag it?
Alonso was fun to watch.
don’t think there were any teams with outstanding strategy, but there were teams with terrible ones.
For those that didn't watched it live, Fernando also joked during the post-race interviews that he thought about chasing down Max at the final restart. But he said that if he did end up overtaking Max, he probably won't make it out of the circuit alive after the race..
Why did Gasly take the podium if Perez finished P3? Did he get a penalty?
Great race, Lewis, Albon, Gasly and Alonso really impressed in that race.
boring
why is no one talking about Zhou Guanyu??!!!
Well i enjoyed this race way more than what i expected.FERNANDO ALONSO GOAT FR... HAPPY FOR GASLY AND OFC SUPER MAX.
Snoozefest 😆
This is why I've watched highlights on YouTube instead of race. Even with exciting and unpredictable conditions the whole circus is focused on a guy strolling about easily in first "breaking records" that can't actually be broken.
Why did Leclerc not finish? Didnt even show here. Poor editing guys.
Fernando Wow Alonso
Why is no one talking about Sainz's defence??
Congratulations max 3 home Grand Prix wins in a row and 9 wins in a row! No matter what people say about him, this guy keeps smashing it!
Biggest target of verstappen for the next year is winning all the races in a season.
ShameBull
Seb’s my goat from my childhood and now my current favourite driver is equalling his record. I’m in a tough place. 😅
Boooorrrrriiiinnnnngggggg......
Alonso today fantastic
f1 would be much better if the drivers switch teams after each race see if the quickest driver can make the slowest car win entertainment all day long
would like to see the overtake try on final lap from Norris
perez speeding in pits while the race was still red flagged is the most face palm moment of 2023. dude coulda rolled down pits at 20km/h.
The pit straight at Zandvoort is reminiscent of that at Interlagos, just shortened and mirrored! Incredible overtakes at turn 1!
Nice.
Typical red flag process, behind the safety car when verstappen is leading. If it was anyone else it would be a standing start
its all getting a bit boring now
Alonso wil win a race this season. GOAT
Why does the video have no sound ?
Really wish the car engine sound was abit louder. The commentator's voice seems like a roaring V12
Please get rid of this endlessly screeching commentator.
All mys respect to Big Alonso
if they didnt force everyone to restart on inters, Alonso could have very possibly won this GP. Still, stunning performance from him and his team today. They did everything right!
Boring 😢 should all have the same car
Thank you checo for your service to Redbull. You will now soon be demoted to Hugo Boss Racing team.
when leclerc go out?
And Ferrari fans still think Leclerc is the better driver... smh
At 2.41 VER simply ran GAS off the road, didn't leave a car's width.  Where's the penalty ?
🎉
Hamilton's drive and overtakes underrated today.
What a boring season !!
Carrerón
ALONSO es GRANDE.
Stop cutting off the podium music ;-;
Boring
I think Liam Lawson is really proving his worth. Beating Yuki in today's race is impressive; especially considering he was called last minute to replace Riccardo & having to get the grips in just 2 days.  Even more impressive is that he managed all of this in very changeable weather conditions. Hopefully he can win this year's Super Formula Championship & get a seat in 2024.   Also congrats to Verstappen for equaling Vettel's Record of 9 wins in a row; I'm pretty confident he'll beat that record.
What a great race today
2:52 Getting an 10.8 second gap to your teamate down to just 3.8 seconds in just 4 laps is mental
Boring
Mmmm ... me wonders about guys like Senna and Peterson ....
Gracias señor Jesu por echar asia delante a Fernando alonso
It's amazing what I little bit of rain will do to the excitement level of a race. It's like F1 should turn on the sprinkler systems at the track when a race starts to get boring 😉😆
Might as well not have wet compound anymore
Verstappen should come to the US or Aus and race some sprints and midgets. He clearly has the "Slide or Die" mentality
PIEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRREEEEE GASSSLLLLLYYYY
A true classic in every aspect.. What a banger! 🧡🔥
George Russell is all about that "win the battle and lose the war" stuff right now. How he can throw away his hardwork like that seems astounding!
Alonso to Ferrari
Am i that only one that thinks no one spoke about how max pushed gasly of the track?
I think formula 1 is manly about the noise of the cars. Why do we not hear anything of that in the video
As an Merc and Ham, i got to say with all honesty... this is the biggest piece dogshit.
gastly last minute podium got me confused
Its turned in to such a boring sport.
I miss the old commentary😢
Crofte please. F1 please bring him back
It's insane how Perez isn't consistently on the podium with a much more dominant car beneath him lol
9 in a row, that’s bizarre. We’re witnessing history
Ferrari is always in form. 11s stop lap 1 :D
best gp so far?
Poor Checo.... Lost time while having the first set of intermediates put on, then hydroplaning into T1, then losing the 2nd place to Fernando after the red flag was waved, and finally the 5 second penalty. It would be nice to see Checo on the podium again. 2nd place would be very difficult as Fernando was absolutely flying!! What a drive by him!
great start from bottas. no. others come pit. he should come first lol, but still not win. car is so bad
Welcome back to podium Alonso.
Go MAX GO!
Well Done Max😂 see you soon✅🥂💯🔥
hehe how much excrement one can put in ''f1'' bucket ...hehe pitiful!...hehe
7:08 someone needs to go to math classes
The season is getting little boring
Max had a 24 second lead before stopping for inters again? Tf?
Now that was an F-1 race. Love that track...very o.s.
Once again Yuuki fell prey to racism
👏👏👏👏👏👍👍👍👍👍💙💙💙💙💙
It doesn’t matter how hard the races it rains on and off, but Max Verstappen still, win again, you can’t stop him🏆👑
No more point watching this year. Matter the conditions, Max is literally 1+ second faster than anyone else.  We need that car to literally have a terminal issue to get another winner.
Nice job Alonso!
Jesus Christ, why is the video quality so bad???
1:41 "Fernando Alonso is going past....FERNADO ALONSO!"
Wow this race was already a race in less than 10 laps hahah crazy!
Lawson is somehow the most forgotten driver this race despite this being his debut
Anyone know what happen to Russell during Lap 68?
We finally got an exciting race, the last one was australia back in March
Liam Lawsons baptism of WATER not fire...   Simply lovely... <3 from NZ
Max verstupen is very boring
Alright, let Liam continue the season. We don't need Ricciardo.
What’s up with every Italy-based team always destroying their own drivers’ race🤦🏻‍♂️
Alguem sabe o que aconteceu com o narrador que era antes desse ai ? Ruim demais esse ta doido.
Another boring race
Boring
Max wins again 😴😴😴😴😴
Haha…Hamilton not even best of the rest anymore…career is over!
Aston martin got fastest lap is something.
PIEEEEEEEERE GAAAAASLYYYYYYYY !!!!! 💙🤍❤️
It's really thrilling in this match.
Grandissimo alonso😁😁😁👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
So happy for Gasly but Alonso very well deserved to be the driver of the day. Man is racing like it’s his rookie season in F1.
I love to see Alonso do well.
Estrategias de Ferrari 💔
more aleques please
Love that racetrack....
Alonso HERO!!
WE ARE SO BACK NANO
The entire Mclaren strategy team either needs to be sacked or shipped back to Ferrari
Hey where's all the screaming and crying about Verstappen winning so much?!?!  No...where, of course. I congradulate Max, of course, who has always been a great racer.  But the crying when Hamilton was winning so much makes me laugh, especially in its absence now.  We all know why :)
sainz initial lap overtake on albon was chefs kiss, too bad he couldnt hold it
The Best race of the F1 2023 season so far
Looks like Alonso will get another Overtake of the Month award for overtaking two cars in the banking corner at the start. Made successful moves against Norris and Zhou in the same corner too.
F1 at the moment is so boring and predictable
Alonso is such a true racer, so far this year he might be the only one to be able to challenge the redbulls, I wish his car was a bit better.
3-5 lap rallycross race has more excitement than any f1 race lol
GOAT CR7
Yuki doing more than 45 laps on soft gotta be the most interesting part here
When Max wins the next race this season will officially be the most boring one to date.
what happened to leclerc? i bet this video needed to be longer...
BUDGET CAP
What a boring F1
The best race of the season. Rain at the start and at the end. Gasly's first podium with Alpine. Alonso back on the podium. Chaos
I'm a Lewis fan...!!  But Max...!!   Fantastic..!!  👍👍
Vamooos Alonso!!!
Its impressive how much Alonso is making Stroll look like an amateur.
10.9 in pits for Checo? And 2.2 for Max? what a coincidence
Wrong team decisions ruined Alex, Lando and Yuki’s chances. Great race, great drive!!
Boring
Why did max get to go on intermediates first amd not the race leader Perez? Odd decision
We are witnessing history in the making with Max on a path of destruction! He is relentless! Great race with the weather and many surprises.
F1 losing popularity in North America
Se vc se sentir inútil as vezes, pense nos pneus de chuva forte da F1..😂
Credit to lawson p14 just behind yuki having a clean race after only one practice session in very tricky conditions
Turn up to the max
“FERNANDO ALONSO IS GOING PAST FERNANDO”😂
El Plan
they should of used buienradar all dutch people do then they would see the rain coming on the radar lol just joking i think max was using buienradar like a real dutchy at 31 lol
8 minutes is not enough to highlight what has happend today! what a Grand Prix!
WHAT A RACE 🔥  RED FLAG.SC.VSC SOFT TYRE MEDIUM HARD INTERS WETS THE BEST RACE OF THIS SEASON BY FAR 🔥 🔥
But Leclerc???
Lewis is so unnoticed in this comment section! Undisputed 🐐
We are at the point that Leclerc retiring isn't even mentioned in the highlights, that's how bad Ferrari has become. It's so sad.
Shitest gp for a while
Awes9me!
F1 has gotten a bit boring. Most of us already know who will win. Max the crybaby.
Alonso🏎💪
Let’s give props to Lawson. Considering he had no dry running, he drove a brilliant race. He Even overtook Leclerc with the worst car on the grid even though Leclerc had damage and got him back but still. Definitely one for the future
Stroll lost the 3d chess game.
Great race!
. All Red Bull works for max. Checo You’re not going to win, Sergio against 15 drivers and Red Bull.
So, we're not talking about McLaren doing a Ferrari strategy?
Mercedes are becoming the new Ferrari. Terrible calls today
Well done Lawson. 13th in these conditions is incredible
Zandvoort is an amazing venue for an F1 race!
Can someone please explain how Piastri only finished 9th. It felt like he made at least 30 overtakes but was barely in the Top 10
Man of the race, obviously ALONSO
What a race, vamos Alonso!
Don't wet tyres exist any more?
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱😴😴😴
Hats off for Lawson, beating his teammate in his first race in easily the most dificult race if the calendar
7:51 where is albon??? where is ocon??? where is hulkenberg??? where is russell? where is Hamilton??? where is piastri??? where is gasly? oh hes right there!
Nowadays there are no dramatic races, no exciting overtaking, just verstappen winning. its getting boring 😪😪😪😪
And once again Perez gets dipped in guacamole
👍👍
Pierre is joining the podcast
McLaren and Williams just went full Ferrari with their strategy in the beginning, and somehow Albon still scored points...
Having a rolling start instead of a standing start should be punishable with jail time. I don't care that it rains, we were robbed of so much more action and potentially an Alonso win with him starting along side Max in wet conditions. And please don't start with "oH buT tHe sAFetY"... the cars are now safer than they have ever been and these are supposed to be the 20 best drivers in the world.
Atrocious driving from Perez
spoiler alert: verstappen wins
Me in the thumbnail seeing leclerc and Perez side by side and trying to think if that was even in this race😂
This whole season is like De Vries' F1 Career,  Pointless.
Terrible strategy from AT once again, Yuki could've finished in the points otherwise
So just not going to show what happened to Leclerc? Ok great
I hope this one from Red Bull gets worse next year, I can't stand to see Max win anymore. I'm only watching because I love formula 1 a lot.
Absolutely terrible highlight didn't show Logans wreck and much more
This was the best race of the season by far! So incredible to watch and that atmosphere! Crazy!
What a nice race
Why's redbull stoped all the time a Sergio Perez to make easier pass to Max
😢 again Verstappen
A race like this one was being necessary
Mercedes managed to destroy Russells Race in an all new way. Amazing
Feel bad for cheko
Zet Jonge Verstappen eens in een Haas?? Wordt hij ook geen winnaar Mr. Jos Verstappen.
from lap 30 to 42, all eyes were on Alex
Three laps four leaders. Verstappen, Norris, Russell and Perez
GASLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
F1 is not competitive anymore!
Disappointed that Piastri didnt do as well as i thought he would. But really happy for Max and GOATlonso!
What is the point of wet tyres if they arent allowed to use them?
Shame that he won again. Would be such a great race for Fernando to claim
That was fast It’s been less than 2 hours
I like that we didn't get to see why leclerc needed a new wing
Lance stroll best wrost partner ever
If it wasn’t for that run off road this would have been Nurburgring 2007 2.0
Let me guess, Verstappen won?
Red Bull strategy jajaja poor checo
Pity about about the 2nd place driver
Great work Lawson! He managed to hold out well for the conditions he was driving in for his debut, can't wait to hopefully see more of him! Alonso had a great race this time around too, it was awesome seeing those overtakes.
Se continuar assim Max Verstappen vai chegar aos 500 pontos
that's opportunistic from  Alonso, of course, he is the great player and he can do it every other race. That's the sign of goat. But, I don't believe that there could be any goat in this sport because not all the great drivers were in the best cars in their prime. There are at least 10 GOATS of this sport and Alonso and Lewis are two of them, Max can now be considered too honestly.
George Perez has to be the most pathetic F1 driver I've seen in my life. The greatest F1 car in history at his disposal, and he's not even a safe bet for a podium place.
Vamos Fernando!! 🔥
the new standings table design looks so bad lol
Soy el único que cree, que la F1 ya es aburrida !?
But they do have proper rain tires, don't they?
Max winning every race is boring
😴😴😴
the lines alonso was taking, the overtakes, the passion and the guts, he's just in another planet, even with now the 5th best car on the grid based on how much they've dropped, again as in monaco they had a chance to re-start 1st and in the race but (I'm still gutted for that cuz they are missing chances) but still an amazing result for a 42 years old man
1:43 Stop SHOUTING
George Russell: “I was forecast a podium there was nothing I could do”
What kind of highlight if it doesn't show how Car 16 out?
The most annoying announcer in motorsports
FIA is racist.  Warwick is also racist.
Alphatauri strategy really ruined Yuki's race. He did a great job of defending and had the pace.
Imagine how awsome would this season be if Max wasn't there...
Action packed race, it had everything!
Boring season
What else is new! Boring F1 don’t we all know who’s going to be the champion and the winner of the coming races, where is the excitement???
Zandvoort is really like Interlagos. The European Brazil Grand Prix
The most boring season ever. And I'm a Max fan.
they really want a reason to get rid of tsunoda dont they
Best drvers of 2023' Zandavoort Circut - Verstappen, Alonso, Gasly, Albon, Ocon, Tsunoda, Hamilton. Giys who watched the whole laps... Prevails this notching opinions.... Swinging tracks, Unpredictable weather.... A PACK OF THRILLS
THE BEST RACE OF THE SEASON. LITERALLY THE ATMOSPHERE, THE FANS, THE OVERTAKES, THE DRAMAS AND A RECORD BEING MATCHED. BEAUTIFUL VENUE AND RACE.. BEST SPORT ON EARTH.
Lap 1 really just shows how Alonso is just on another level compared to the rest of the field (except Max obv)
How Checo is doing so awesome and is going to be replaced by Daniel Ricardo makes zero sense!
Alonsy Alonso, wooooo!
Mid.  9 wins for Max now. Just get the 10th and end our suffering.
I’m super impressed Liam Lawson finished. My driver of the day.
On a car to driver ratio.  Alonso was the fastest driver out there.
What is the point of wet tyres, if we don't race in the rain? Surely inters are "Damp"?
Verstappen is an alien, but Albon and Alonso's season it's being incredible.
I wish these modern Commentators would stop SHOUTING
This was CHAOS!
Weather gods 9th race in a row doing everything to mess up Max’s race and he still manages to keep winning.
What a disgusting language...maybe German is more...
another win for max...... no challenge? it seems getting bored with same player.  I quit watching NBA when lakers dominated many year. this is another one?
Alonso on 🔥
MaxForce
Alonso made some phenomenal overtakes this race, including overtaking Norris in the wet with dry tyres
Why doesn't it start with "It's lights out and away we go" anymore?
Alonso is driver of the day IMO.
Chadlonso deserves a victory at this point.
you cant tell me 2:39 was legal
Lando so overrated.
Albon❤
Sargeant lifeguard>>>>>>>Sargeant Driving
You have to feel for Russell. So much bad luck this season.
Verstappen the true goat! 🥳
How did Sargent lose so many places in the first few laps?
MAX  was super again, nex week Italië again number 1 yes .👍👍🎉🎉
Amazing race 👏
Well done to Rob Nobstappen for his 9th consecutive win 👎
short summary of this race: verstappen beeing the goat. alonso beeing the grandpa boss we all wished we had in our live. gasly displaying his talent (we wished he d doing more often) once again. perez being perez once again. sainz scoring silently. hamilton outperforming this merc and chances once again. norris somewhat dissappointing ressult yet still a great effort. albon outperforming williams as usually. piastri doing great for a rookie. ocon showing great promise yet disappointing. stroll being stroll...
Brilliant, they didn't show why Leclerc randomly DNF
How about forcing teams on to wet tires rather than a red flag? so afraid of the rain lol shambles
Logan spending half of the race by himself in a Lawnchair was kinda depressing to see
Great race. 5 second penalty for ocon
Comes on Fernando Alonso great performance 👌👏
Perez is too slow he is not a racer.
Gasley is always strong in rain.....
It showing Hamilton v sainz here is criminal
Come on Maxxxx!!  10 for 10 incoming
Pierre Gasly Wow Great Driving Took the Gamble at the first pit of Rain and it paid of as he finished the Race 3rd with Sergio Perez having a 5s Penalty, Bravo Gasly
What a race!
Just to let everyone know, Logan Sargeant crashed because his units changed from "mph" to "kph". That flustered him 🦅 🇺🇸
MAX MAX SUPER MAX MAX!!
Lawson was great! Beating Tsunoda when driving this car for only FP3, not to mention rain, changeable conditions. That guy made no mistake, while Perez did some. What a difference...
Rain red flags crashes and still max can not be stopped.
Why was Leclerc taken out??
Yuki,,,😢😢😢😢 alfatauri, fia, godem
2:41 So is it just me that thinks Verstappen’s pass on Gasly had a hint of forcing another car off track? Rosberg would have taken a penalty for that!
Boring verstapen
che noia infinita..
Super Max 🏆🏆
I have stopped watching F1 as it seems to be fixed from all angles. Max will win all races no matter what ever the conditions r. And other drivers have to just do the formalities of racing.
Worst edit so far this season 😢
What happened to Leclerc?
STOP SHOUTING FOR GODS SAKE MAN.
Hamilton up to 6th, what a legend. Where would he have ended up if it weren’t for goofy tsunoda impending him
buah carrerón
2023🇸🇦🇸🇦🇸🇦 P3 Alonso 👉 NO 5s FIA 🤝 2023🇳🇱🇳🇱🇳🇱 P3 Perez 👉 NO 5s FIA
Best race of the year so far
Who all agree that F1 is getting boring?
I was hopeful Alonso was going to give us excitement at the end, but at the end of the day he is in an Aston, so I suppose we got as much as we could hope for.
What happened to Leclerc
Too much information in this race 😮
What was Aston Martin doing with Stroll ? Stroll pitted for medium and Russell pitted for hard , Russell had a long stint but stroll got pitted only after few laps and had long stint in soft that made no sense
WHY DIDN'T THEY BRING LANDO IN ONE LAP SOONER?!?!
Stroll has no more excuses
Gasly proved himself what a driver
RB19, greatest car ever built.
Rain or Shine, 19 drivers are "Seeing Dutch Orange."
Fernando 🦁
boooring
We don't even get the full driver's standings now
Where is Tsunoda’s masterclass defence against Norris???🥲
Glad that Zandvoort was able to show what it’s worth. Hope it is here to stay
F1 is a fools folly!   Redbull is making f1 look like a banana republic!  They have never shown their full power!  They laugh at F1 every race and  then vercrapin cries to make it look legit!   What a total joke!
Ferrari never fails to make Masterclass pitstop
Padronso
Another boring racing
Warwick is a Japanese racist & Alpha Tauri is an amateur team
McLaren asleep in the strategy office today. Wasted a solid opportunity for a podium.
As much as I hate dominance in F1, this run of form from Max and RB is so impressive, congrats to Max Fernando and Pierre, this was a really hectic race, and top job by those three
What a tough race
Albon was probably the main highlight of this race. Going 30+ laps on softs without putting and staying in the top 5 for some time and a P8!
The first lap was mental
20 years later and Nando is still a beast. What a driver.
What happened is Yuki in last lap? From P12 to the P16?
Also glad for Alonso and AM some big hauls today 🎉
McLaren took strtegy lessons from Ferrari today.
copy we're checking, oh man  this voice is very familiar
A Thriller Race from start to finish. WOW
Ferrari of the day: Mercedes
Race of the season so far, congratulations Max Verstappen for matching Ascari and Vettel’s record of 9 in a row and well done Fernando Alonso what a stunning drive from such a great champion
Come on Tsunoda!!
Best race ever
Starts with the dutch anthem at a dutch grand prix and ends in a dutch anthem
Can't watch any races live but by the looks of this highlights it sured felt like THE best race of 2023 yet 🔥🤩
What a race today!🔥
Alonso won this race.    Of course, Max won, but let's face it.   Nando had the pace, strategy and all out self-will to get the job done.   Max has the gods on his side.   Dunno what's happening with Checo.   The cars are the same.
Perez should have some pride ad retire this is embarrassing really
I so wish Alonso gets a race winning car ASAP....
It’s more and more boring to watch Max win it all.. F1 is a great genre of sport that was assassinated by Red Bull..
Liam Lawson’s Debut Race: dry track  intermediate track  full wet track  red flag vsc safety car rolling start  overtaking a ferrari  The guy’s CV is stacked as if he’s raced a full season from just 1 race
Bro why didn't they do a standing start like you're supposed to do after a RED FLAG?  I'm sick and tired of F1 nowadays, they always used to race in the rain and not play it ultrasafe like they do nowadays.  Even 3 years ago they would've just done a standing start like they're supposed to.  Is it because they're all pansies or because they're trying to give verstappen advantage?
Max is Tarzan.
Max is such a dominant athlete.  Can anything stop Red Bull and Honda?  What we are witnessing is simply the pinnacle of motor sports.  A weekend we will all tell our grand children about.
Another episode of Max Verstappen podcast, but this time with a new guest
Absolute boss!
Hamilton overtakes 14. Overtakes shown 3
Alonso vs Hamilton for P3 in championship. thats the stuff
Wow
Verstappen literally pushing Gasly off the track despite having inter tires: the FIA sleeps Gasly going 0.1km/h above the speed limit in pits: +5 seconds penalty  What a joke.
One of the best races this season!
Esses pilotos da Williams vão quebrar à equipe
角田はワーウィックとタウリと戦ってるな
What happened to Leclerc? Why the video didn't show he gettint out?
It is utterly hilarious that the red flag comes out before full wets do
Get in there Max. Alonso 😎
Alonso, true king.
Nice race for Albon, two times Williams made a wrong call but still on points.
Race of the year.
Commentators are ruining the experience
I have to give a mention to Verstappen on slicks in the semi wet conditions. He was multiple leagues faster than everyone else by going up to 4 secs faster than his teammate and over 6 secs faster than everyone else at one point. What a race this has been
Albon was so underrated today. The team bottled the strategy so bad, he lost one and a half minute because of it. But still he drove through the rain with slick tires, went on to stop with softs after 43 laps and still ended up in the points. Unreal stuff.
I an so happy for alpine, they deserve that podium❤🎉
I know it doesn’t matter but why isn’t anyone talking about Lando and Lewis’s photo finish. They were separated by like 0.02 seconds!
What a Rollercoaster race
Alonso´s double overtake in the inside of the turn 3 is pure magic.
THANK YOU FERNANDO 🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🇪🇦🐐💚💚💚💚
Not me really just coming here for the comments..
Rain reveals the real driver......
Fernando u beauty🎉
Outstanding conditions and an amazing race This Really Is the best sport in the world
The best Race of the Season so far!
I still miss lights out and away we go
Yeahh Alonso!!!
Alonso was on fire yo🔥
Great recovery driver for Lewis
Poor Yuki was a LION until AT employed bad strategy
Alonso did amazing this GP. Max equaled the record. Amazing.
This race feels like it's already predictable but also unpredictable one. What a bipolar race this one. 😂
That was the best race of the year until now, without a doubt.
Congratulations Max on 9 consecutive races win in a row.
Double dutch anthem.
PEREZ 😂
It's funny how the secondary highlight of the race is sargeant's grief and reflection moments
So happy for Pierre! 🎉❤❤
Only Fernando seems to have mastered that bank perfectly.  He was the only one to move freely around that corner and overtake his rivals.  He is also the first to find the fastest line on the outside in 2021.  As expected of Fernando.
Let's gooooo
Max making up 10 seconds to Perez in 5 laps is absolutely insane
Perez should receive a penalty of 10 seconds, not 5, because when he went off the track in the first turn, he did not turn on the secondary road but on the opposite side of the road😢😢😊
Gasly's career has had so many ups and downs till date wow. What a drive from him.
FIA should invest in artificial rain that they can drop on the track at anytime they want to make races more interesting to watch.
One of the best races this season
Gasly on the Podium? Wow! I think I'm gonna have a date with Margot Robbie 🤸
Can we have crofty and brundle back on these highlights?
That was an exciting/chaotic race and yet Max stayed calm and in control. Congrats Verstappen in equalling Seb Vettel’s record of nine consecutive wins. 😊  Liked by Pierre Gasly too with his P3 finish. 😅
Max Verstappen wins😊
0:21 Alonso must get the Overtake of The Month award for that Inside line move on Albon & Russell.
Holy rain
Yuki drove so well for most of the race and AlphaTauri decided to mess up his strategy. And the penalty was super harsh. Should've at least fought for points.
3 DNFs. Rained 2 times. Some cars pitting early and some late. Safety cars and red flag.  But Verstappen Still Wins 🏆 😂 Truly Inevitable
7 minutes too late.
hate to say it but congrats to max for 9 in a row
Why didn't they show leclerc retiring?
So boring why verstappen win all races
Ferrari always innovating new ways to let Charles down
Best race so far!
I didn't understand what the heck was going on with Tsunoda!! What kind of strategy was that! Alphatauri making Ferrari proud with their strategies!
What a weekend from FP! to quali to race.... Positives for Williams then turn bad for sargeant and albon... max dominating again... bad day for Mercedes and Perez... WHAT A RACE THIS WAS
角田の5秒ペナルティの裁定には疑問を抱く！
Checo needs to quit. Red Bull set him up he was leading and got undercut it was clear as day and Ferrari needs to just let this season go.
In the end, he is him afterall 🐐
EL PLAN
max just keeps getting away with pushing ppl off track
You are all witnessing history 😊
Chaos GP
The weather has changed 3 times by the time you finish reading this comment
Topical dutch weather😂 loved this race💪🏻
Thumbnail goes hard
I stopped watching during the red flag, why did Perez go back to 3rd after the restart? He came out of the pit in 6th
Great seeing Alonso back on podium & gasly too, great race from Liam especially in the conditions he faced in a track/car he’d never driven on/in
albon drove an incredible race man williams made him stick out the whole first stint in rain and mess up the inter switch again still points
Look not only at the top, but also at the middle. Tsunoda does great work every time, but Stewart interrupts him. How can he be rewarded?
How is leclerc still the team favourite. Sainz has proved he’s better almost every race for the last 2 years
I never thought Zandvoort could be this exciting, but this race was absolutely amazing. Hope the drivers enjoyed our weather as much as I have
Sergeant Logan knows that his fate has been sealed with that crash. Poor lad.
this one needs extended highlights!!
So early there’s not a custom thumbnail yet
Zandvoort is the best circuit, vibe, event, on the f1 calendar its one big party. 🇳🇱
GASLY COOKED
Nine out of ten for this crazy race despite Max Verstappen winning again.
Mega job from Albono
Max is unstoppable! So amazing to witness history right now.
If only Williams nailed the strategy Albon could have challenged for a podium
This track is just boring...😒
this race was incredable
Some people say that on equal cars, Max wouldn’t be so awesome. I say with no regrets, Max is awesome by himself, and I love how they ignore him while he keeps breaking records.
We want Turkish Grand Prix 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
maxmaxmaxmaxmaxmax
Verstappen was inevitable.
Im here before they made a thumbnail!
Gasly from 12th and a 5 seconds penalty to 3rd 😮😮
2:35 How is that not forcing another driver off the track? Stewards turning a blind eye on Max as usual
Again norris failing wet track hahaha
UNACCEPTABLE how MaxBull stole the race to Checo, unfuckingbelievable!!!
Sometimes the strategy of Mercedes is Ferrari like.
albon still getting p8 while battling his own teams strategy is ridiculous
Why didn't they show leclerc not having the tires during the pit stop?
How did Norris and Russell fall to the back to the grid?
This is the best race of this season so far. ❤🔥
Verstappen, Alonso, Gasly...What a podium 🔥
What a race, 9 wins in a row
Really enjoyed all 12 on-track overtakes. This track has to go
Boring winner
The thumbnail is amazing

I'm so glad albon is getting the recognition he deserves
I love Zandvoort, fast paced racing with 2 banking corners and a tremendous Orange army creating an epic atmosphere.
Gasly from 17th to 3th awesome race !!
'as the rain begins to fall' like 400 times in that intro hahaha
We need extended highlights
One of the best ferrari vs merc strategy battles .
Poor Otmar. Not there to see a rare podium.
Alex Goatbon, Fernando sigmalonso and Pierre goatly 🥶
This is a race highlights. But I am very much missing the DUTCH FANS partying, this really added to this Grand Prix
I love Gasly reactions everytime he gets a superb result.
2 world championships don't do justice to Fernando man. What a driver. Absolutely on fire today. I hope he can win a race before the season ends, he truly deserves it.
To show how omnipresent Alonso is: 2004 - Michael Schumacher matches the record for 7 wins in-a-row, Alonso is on the podium. 2013 - Sebastian Vettel beats the record with 9 wins in-a-row, Alonso is on the podium. 2023 - Max Verstappen matches the record for 9 wins in-a-row, Alonso is on the podium.  19 years later and he's still there. What a guy.
Red "Help Max as much as possible" Bull
Rain makes this season so much more fun
Besidex max dominance this has been an amazing race
BRING BACK DAVID CROFT
Max the G.O.A.T. Amazing job!
Please give Pérez's RedBull to Alonso

Incredible performance from gasly,can't believe it,i truly can't.
What happened with Yuki? 40+ laps on the softs and they still didnt take advantage of the rain...
Ohhhh Fernando Alonso!! kudos to Gasly
Great race lewis!🐐
Why do we get other commentators in the highlights?

Alonso has the start of the season
squeezing this into 8 minutes is impressive
This was a spicy GP. Hectic first 10 and final 10+ laps. Huge props to Gasly for podium, Albon for staying in points, and of course, Lawson for 13th!
Red Bull clean sweep looking more and more likely
First certified banger of the season
Thanks for sharing these so quickly, much love ❤
Very entertaining race 👌
“I like it when it’s wet”  Max Verstappen
great grand prix, super happy for gasly's result. sad for tsunoda who had a great race up until they left him out on this slicks
First not
This race was absolutely crazy.😱🤩🤩🤩🤩😱😱😱
Definetley the best race of the season so far. Shame it still wasn't a 10/10 in my opinion because a Red Bull driver won.... Again...  8.5/10 Still exciting race tho
Already has a highlight?????????
Poor strategy from McLaren, costed Lando P2 or P3
The world would be a better place if Lando pitted in the first lap.
Great race comrades
This is definetly my favorite race of the season. I'm a Max fan, and he won, and I know it can be a little boring. But this race was different. Anything could've happened. I wish all races were this entertaining.
Vertsappen in a different league
Am actual race of the season displayed right here
Mercedes employing Ferrari strategists today lol
Oh Fernandooo Alonsooo! 💙 What a comeback!
Nice race historical reminded me of Germany 2019 Another victory for Max and bad luck for Sergio, he had the podium and he lost it again In short, the bulls stronger than ever
“Did Max undercut me “ 😅😅😅😢😢😢

That was fast
So happy for Fernando and Pierre. P1 and P2 of F1.5
Williams always spinning the dice

Such a sad and dreadful case to see many F1 drivers retired from track and field for showing how tough to drive and survive in a wet-weather.
Even though it was a max win, it was still an amazing race, glad that albon was in the points and gasly on the podium!
