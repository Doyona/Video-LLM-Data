This is actually next level I can’t stop watching this 💯💯
https://youtu.be/U2XXDrul1ZM
The voice
Vbb
woooooooow
First part of the hook reminds me of Popcaan "Everything Nice"
Folks we need to wake up they're literally slapping it in people's faces now. They don't even care they know we in the end of days, so they don't care at this point, cause the anti Christ otherwise known as the false Messiah is about to reveal himself to the world after they cause destruction on the world and america is broken down. Folks if it was anytime to pray and repent now would be the time. Accept the most high elohim's commandments now, and the gospel of our savior that died for our sins and rose again, now and repent. I'm not looking for a argument, I'm simply telling you that I've woken up out of this world and it's distractions. I'm telling you this year didn't happen for any reason they have something planned for sure. I hope y'all realize that this vaccine the election and their false Messiah who the Jews are now calling for is about to happen, and trust me they got plans for whoever don't take the vaccine and all resisters. Guillotines and other methods go search up the plan they got that been in act since the Obama Care. They just was waiting to do it. Go watch ipet goat and y'all will see they got the world fooled right now with thinking it's gone go back to the way it was. You can't tell with the weather, earthquakes, floods, meteors, threats of big astroids.all types of evil symbols they putting on the shows we watch. Smh go look at netflix programming us and our kids to do certain things, and act certain ways, and the music for you to have a mushed out brain. Don't get me started on the social media stuff. Mean while if you look over seas you can see they're enacting their plan which is bout to be starting with this peace deal, and other stuff. I'm telling you right now it's bout to get tragic we got to stop playing with God and our one true Messiah. Time is short just do your research, people are waking up and getting out of this occult world that God is about to judge. The time is about to come where comfortability will be taken away and you will have to make a decision to choose our creator (yahuah) and his son the one true Messiah (yahusha) or this world and Satan and the anti Christ, flesh or the spirit, Life or death. I truly believe the rapture will happen to so some believers won't half to endure the things coming upon this earth, but just know if after seeing this and you continue to act like you don't care and you don't believe what I'm saying nor believe to follow God and repent or you just to selfish to wanna change. God has a place for these people, the unrepentant of all kinds shall see the lake of fire after all this, and they're judgement shall come quickly, and he will send the unprepared a strong delusion, that they should believe a lie and suffer. America is going down to start this off so if you live in this country like I do you should be utterly prepared now repenting and staying in the word and doing the commandments of our father and believing what his only begotten son has done for the world of the wicked. Please folks wake up. I was like everybody else, walking in the same wy drinking smoking cursing listening to the same type of music partying and worried bout myself, but I've changed my ways and have been studying hours of scripture and getting out of the false religion and the falseness of this world and studying Satans plan with the elite. Folks wake up now ask for forgiveness, and repent now time is most definitely short love y'all💯🙏🏽💟💟💖.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who is back here to clear their ear 👂 after listening to Wizkid (MIL) & Davido (ABT) album?

Love your music Burna this album just made my whole year and eternally this is Album is legendary shout King
To y'all, all the women and all people capable of falling in love with a man watching and listening to this... This song is for you I am not even lying.. This is a true message from a man to his loved one. About the struggles he needs and wants to be done with and somehow "neglect" you for. But the man needs you, he needs your support and love and don't want to push you away from him for this, or isn't doing this because he doesn't have no time for you, or doesn't have or feel some love for your person. "So please; please stay, say you won't leave...."  Blessings and love on every one people 🙏🏾❤️❤️❤️

*Burna Boy - No Fit Vex [Official Audio]* https://youtu.be/gKbO7hh2Ad8
This song is great all round, Stormzy killed the chorus. 🚀🚀
Tryna find my peace of mind, You said how could you be so blinded😔😔😔😔
Hit after hit...every song jamming
Amazing Track ❤️❤️❤️❤️  Officially responsible for the 0.0001% of the views
Ghana ft Nigeria - Gotta love it
🐐🐐

What's this sample in the background??
Much love from Angola 🇦🇴.
The song was good until Stormzy started singing 😩
New Track on my channel! go check it, it helps
https://youtu.be/YP8Di6CbmVI topboy montage
MORE FYA!!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
King buna ride on
From this song i just know that stormzy's voice is so special
Burna never dissapoints 👌🔥
🔥🔥🔥
Wasn't expecting vocals from stormzy tbh
💯👌
This is deep. Love how they switch roles. Stormzy singing and Burna rapping. For me , this is Burna's best.
Diddy all over this Master-piece !!! Love that
Stormzy really does ruin every song he’s on or even made
Who else is feeling the old school vibes in this track
This song🔥🔥♥️
❤️💙
Listening from the Helen of the West, St. Lucia and I don't even understand everything Burna is saying in the songs when he sings in the African languages but I could feel his music in my soul so big up all the descendants of Africa in the Caribbean!!
THE AFRICAN DRAKE
This song gets me in feelings everytime i listen to this!😢😢
great track Burna Boy & Stormzy
Hmmmm if they want f#$£ you for yansh make u no like that 🚶🏿‍♂️
fire!!!!  burna boy you are hotter than water in a tea-kettle. well done mate
This is a master piece
🔥🔥🔥💖🍍
Burna boy is a real african giant. Big up
I liked it before i listen to it because i know this guy he don't disappoint
Please burna don't sing in pidgin, this dope
THis album is defintely bringing home a Grammy! Big ups OluwaBurnaahh!

Acoustic version https://youtu.be/zE98glTSMVA
Wow this song just no words man burna at it again..
Nice collabo🌎 Stormzy is fire    We need another with J Hus 🌼💞💞
Ye ye ye ye ye ye
My fav on the album
This is it right here
young but old school head, these are the kind of vibes i like listening to.
I don't know the "Afrofusion"
Why does stormzy sound like he about to breakup with his girl after he messed up and asking for her to stay.
This is my favourite second only to Twice as tall.
Grammy take it 👑
Everyone reading this will be successful and live long
Good one ☝️ 🙏👊🏿
I hear auto tune. I switch off.
t-pain - I'm sprung...you're welcome
Dope🔥
I had a fond and emotional connection with this song, like it was written for me 😆, to say that this is my favourite song of the album despite all of them being my favourite 🤣🙌🏾  the album is art, is a vibe, is educational, is rich in all positive meanings and ways!  God bless Burna Boy and all the artists he collaborated with 🙌🏾🙌🏾🥳🥳🥳
Great
Burna Boy.....never...ever.....disappoints!
NA MEN  MY BEST TUNE  STEADY ON REPEAT  🖤💛💯💪🏿
Big tuneeeeeeeee
Burna Boy for Life!
This beat is similar to Bad Energy by Skepta ft Wizkid......Nice jam all the same.
Ever since I heard Burna Boy on "Location", I can't get enough of his deep melancholic voice. Here before 1 mil
I feel so at peace listening to this song.

Zimbabwe approves🏌️💯🇿🇼
oluwaaaaaa!!!!  Burna is just untouchable
Stormzy tough, Burna Boy is mixing with the right person 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I respect obo but please no one can topple this guy. This is crazy. Now he’s gone international singling in pure English, trying to reach a much wider audience. That first verse really surprised me!
🔥🇰🇪👊
this track surely has sample on it, anyone knows the sample song
The sample is bothering I know its not T pain but something else cant put my finger on it
This song is a bombbbbb burna. Loving your flow especially in the last part
I want him to win a Grammy.   But at the same time, I want him to stay my secret 😂😂😂😂  Anyone agree?
But Who knows how burnaboy gets his inspiration?..   i have been thinking of this too... i felt his voice is his inspiration. if u don't believe me den checkout dis video https://youtu.be/glyQ2cLdgJs
The next Grammy goes to burnaboy. 5billion steams😱😱
Dope song from naija to london big up..
If you like drill or uk rap you need to check up and coming rappers “Mikey C & Chuckie p - Jumanji” trust me it’s 🔥🔥🔥
😤🤙🏾
everyone keeps  going on about burna and stormzy but keep forgetting the melodic female background singer who contributed to this track. i don't know her name but big props to you..
Is that the snake Diddy in the intro

Spoiler 🚨 Burna is Good, but this not our type of gbedu,  so if you want in;  stay in. Pdd has nothing to offer u, he just needs u. Just remember Dbanj
Can anybody please tell the origin of the sample and song name please. I’m trying to find it. The sample is obvious during the first few seconds of the song

This song! 🙆‍♂️🔥
How to help burna boy #twiceastall chart.(part1)  APPLE MUSIC: - delete your purchased track from iTunes (if you bought the song), you can still download it again so don't worry about it being a waste - search for the song and stream for it to be counted - leave it on repeat and offline streaming counts - Goals: Top 10  — Why are we buying tracks separately? In most countries, album sales are now including streams along with song sales. 10 song sales = 1 album sale. It will count for both song and album chart / certifications if buy it individually, instead of just 1 album sale.  Share the information
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

LYRICS  [Intro: Diddy] It ain't like you hearing it and it's like moving you You know music is, and the music you making is life, and it's like new life It's important to me to understand the state of mind and the life you live and where you're, you know, where you're at right now  [Verse 1: Burna Boy] Pull up like "Surprise, surprise it's the President" Can't you see that I'm in my element? I might just decide to slide on my enemies I go along on a glide for the hell of it I bring a different vibe when I'm steppin' in If a nigga ain't right, I'm correcting him Everybody know for sure, I'ma take it there So cross your T's and dot your I's when you're messaging I never subscribe to guys on the internet Living for the clout, telling lies to the press again Better don't take me for the fool I ain't never been Don't bother with lies, I'm wise when I'm checkin' in I'm redirecting dem back to the sender men Then you go see reality, go start arresting dem Be like say dem no hear when I was telling dem Life real, I ain't never like the rest of them  [Pre-Chorus: Stormzy] Yes, we are blessed but it's harder to see sometimes Tryna find my peace of mind You said how could we be so blinded? You just follow your dreams and go live your life I give you something to believe in, I'ma be the reason  [Chorus: Stormzy] So please (So please), please stay (Please stay) Say you won't leave (Say you won't leave) Real life is for living but the vibes you've been giving's not true So please stay We'll share the whole thing, yeah Real life is for living Use this life that you're living, be free  [Verse 3: Burna Boy] I wonder which style dem guys dem go try now If una never hear my story mek you find out I know say nobody is an island But if dem wan fuck you for nyash, mek you no lie down And I know you fit later realize am But the way you don dey move I no dey lie down Somebody want to wear the shoe wey no size am Me, I be destiny's child a survivor Real, no be China Come here I've been the guy And nothing I ever said ever been a lie Anytime you see me, look up in the sky I can see the daylight in the night When you see a soldier smile, it's a good sign That's the way it is on the Southside I no go let you slide, no, not this time But now I'm tryna ride, fuck a good time Goodbye  [Pre-Chorus: Stormzy] Yes, we are blessed but it's harder to see sometimes Tryna find my peace of mind You said how could we be so blinded? You just follow your dreams and go live your life I give you something to believe in, I'ma be the reason  [Chorus: Stormzy] So please (So please), please stay (Please stay) Say you won't leave (Say you won't leave) Real life is for living but the vibes you've been giving's not true So please stay We'll share the whole thing, yeah Real life is for living Use this life that you're living, be free
This is just a proved that Black is  real king when we come together and work together.
Calming, rugged collab.

You just follow your dreams and go live your life I give you something to believe in, I'ma be the reason    [Chorus: Stormzy] So please (So please), please stay (Please stay) Say you won't leave (Say you won't leave) Real life is for living but the vibes you've been giving's not true So please stay We'll share the whole thing, yeah Real life is for living Use this life that you're living, be free  [Verse 3: Burna Boy] I wonder which style dem guys dem go try now If una never hear my story mek you find out I know say nobody is an island But if dem wan fuck you for nyash, mek you no lie down And I know you fit later realize am But the way you don dey move I no dey lie down Somebody want to wear the shoe wey no size am Me, I be destiny's child a survivor Real, no be China Come here I've been the guy And nothing I ever said ever been a lie Anytime you see me, look up in the sky I can see the daylight in the night When you see a soldier smile, it's a good sign That's the way it is on the Southside I no go let you slide, no, not this time But now I'm tryna ride, fuck a good time Goodbye    [Pre-Chorus: Stormzy] Yes, we are blessed but it's harder to see sometimes Tryna find my peace of mind You said how could we be so blinded? You just follow your dreams and go live your life I give you something to believe in, I'ma be the reason  [Chorus: Stormzy] So please (So please), please stay (Please stay) Say you won't leave (Say you won't leave) Real life is for living but the vibes you've been giving's not true So please stay We'll share the whole thing, yeah Real life is for living Use this life that you're living, be free
They don't have an excuse to deny you your gong no more.
