Just like doctor Kumar , except the music version 💀🤦‍♂️🤡

After what we learned about the whole P Diddy connection, it's hard to see Burna Boy the same way or to be convinced by what he sings. We just picture him with P Diddy...

Jeremiah birthday sex beat 😢
Wizkid is the best Artist 😊❤❤❤❤
Always sexualizing women. Cars, jewelry, and asses. When are you understanding that women are not part of a man with money's furniture. Thank goodness women are waking up and seeing this crap. This is what women are to most men: merchandise. PS: Especially FUNNY coming from black men. I remind you that you too are dehumanized by white man. And then you get a little bit of power and voice and do the same with women. Lame.

Not gonna lie, I don know some phrases but mad respect because I feel the message in a single verse, without context. (I'd say I'm a basic white bitch but I'm French Aboriginal so...)  (re: Aboriginal) We're not basic and not wholly white, if even "mixed", so. I'm just ignorant and accepting it. But I vibe with this and wish to learn more one-day when I encounter the right people to share with me. (I came here cos my Uber driver was shook that I knew this song/sang with him...I just now decided to watch the vid.) ❤

Overrated
It was Last year I commented about this lyric but am still playing it almost every day.
City boys we up
Such a baddie song
blazing vibe
Is the ass shaking necessary? I like Burna Boy's music but his videos are becoming westernised.... it's disappointing
Niggah this song on my mind  This song hit crazy💯💯💯
Is this the same dude who said Black Americans "have no culture"? Meanwhile his whole look bites off Black American culture, GTFOOH!

The shit that makes Nigeria Music incredible is the mix of English and Yoruba. The Yoruba language is one of the most flexible languages ever. You will appreciate Nigeria songs more if you can hear the language. I just listed to the lyrics and didnt know half of the song is in Yoruba. Talking more about transition from Poor to riches.
Dem strippers tho 😊

What´s wrong with you Africans?? What´s the point of "Flashing Wealth" in A Continent of children starving to death!? You tell me now! What is the thing that started the Genocide in Rwanda if not "Rasism" amongst Yourself! "Flashing" Diamond Watches and expensive cars, Whilst your people are starving is NOT getting to me??? - I just dont get it?????

DAMNNNN ….. so many jealous haters. Em is different not better. He had the resource’s to slow MGK down but didn’t stop him and today hes rising to the top “Pressure” goes hard 🔥💯
You’ve got to be really dedicated to be puking your guts out…sick as shit from alcohol poisoning and still get on stage and wild out. Badass live performance and all these years later he’s still banging and with his day ones and always shows love to his city. He’s so humble cause he sent these invites and didn’t think anyone would show and they all did…plus some. That’s gotta be a good feeling. Fan for life

Yo Burna needs to be jailed for running a heist on all these R&B classics and tearing them a new hole with vibes harder than the originals. This is straight up criminal activity from Lagos.
Jamacan version of pop smoke
Love it❤️🤞🏾
i ;love burna boy his energy is everything i cant get enough of his songs we need more of these kind of flow keep it up its so good and refreshing and good vibes😍🥰😇
💫💦🌀💓💕🌷🙀👃💝😸😽💯💗🛸🤍💩😾😹🥰😺😼💞😻🌓🕊️😿✈️🕊️
It is a fire
This kind of beat looks like that of Dr Dre. If you listen all the songs in Get Rich or Die Trying by 50 cent,there are some beats there you could trace to this sound too. The producer and Burna boy did a great job   They blend the Afro beat song to the best perfectly
termless     stupid
How so is not 1.1 b views 🤔 😳
Kenya here. Wizkid always giving his all in every song good music wandecoal..
When you realize the beat is birthday sex by trey songs 😅😂

"I don't care if I saw you on a magazine or on tv, that won't mean nothing to me"😂😂🔥🔥
The editing is not nice and with the rythm of the music.  A bit too choppy to my taste
If you are here in 2030, know that I was here seven years before you🫡✌️😅
Let all africa know the big ones in africa need songs
All country's in Africa got the honor to say they are green light nobody could leav3 africa or in for life that's just the way it is and In America look at your own kind africans only go out with African women the more African pure the. Better for life keeping it real.
This shit is a banger ☄️

goated
And to the “smart ones” who say “ oooo I’m not a CV I’ve known and listen to him.. lol this is to those people and the other ones.. BLACK is not a thing.. it’s only a thing when it benefits YOU.. so Africa is DEFINITELY NOT a thing .. so why jump on him and Afrobeats and all this s*** everybody is taking now..where WERE you before he had hits? He STILL was making music at the time.. hints .. how he got to where he is at now.. so stop being fake people.. listen to his music and enjoy it stop trying to be in a conversation .. it’s not about you it’s HIM
You know what I hate .. FAKE MOFO.. 99% of you silly MOFO’S are not listening to this man’s music.. you are listen to 2-4 songs that hit the radio.. everybody responded to him posting I TOLD YOU.. but how many out of them who commented will listen to his song .. I TOLD THEM… ?lmao im extremely curious to know.. F’in CV’S
Thank you Burna Boy

Salvation free to those who believes Jesus is coming back ,by the way I do love some of your songs .  But think about your soul ...
Have you asked yourself when your old and your sexiness gone what happens to your soul , when all the fame and money gone ,and one day your name will not be a famous as it's today ..   Micheal Bolton was once handsome and famous today not much people go crazy over a old white man .no offence to Micheal Bolton .
Niceee❤❤❤
Different 🥂🐐🖤
The best  song ever 😊
seeing quavo makes the song even better

Hot 🥵
I made a house remix of this, listen to it at my channel if you have time! :)
To All Nigerian's Reading this, This is the root of All your problems (yoruba behaviour) I don't hate Any tribe in Nigeria but I hate people that practice the (Seven deadly sins) on daily basis. When I was working in  construction Alot of yoruba's use homosexuality to attain top positions. Instead of working hard like other migrants they always choose the easy route. Many banks in UK are afraid to employ  Nigerians because of all the fruads committed by yoruba's. In the uk Alot of yoruba's I know hardly have their shower they stink up the whole place. Their homes always look like a dumping ground. Also Alot of yoruba's wash their meat(food) in their dirty bathtub. They are the biggest liars I have ever met. A yoruba man or woman will condemn corruption but secretly will take bride from one of their relatives in politics. Yoruba women are probably the biggest prostitutes I have ever met. If you are a yoruba or any tribe behaving like such, change your ways, repent from your sins, if you stolen Anybodies stuff return it or  the vengeance of Jehovah will follow you for the rest of your life. If you have made false accusations against anyone just tell the truth(the truth will set you free) if you have committed any homosexual acts pray to Jehovah for forgiveness and change your Evil ways. if you are dirty pray to God for cleanliness(cleanliness is next to Godliness)
laughable..buys views,and people think this is fine..corruption at its most cynical..yet people go with it..laughable.
Stole Jeremiah Birthday sex beat....1 thing about Immigrants they gonna steal American culture and mix with theirs play like its them allll along

I love this f**kin song Always loved my black men
Much love from Angola 🇦🇴🇦🇴🇦🇴. We love you so much Burma 🤙🤙
Burna you are very talented and i absolutely love the beats to this song  but not the music video because of him showcasing blackwomen in the  most degradinglg. Uncouth. disrespectful way. Its 2023 When will our black men in music finally showcase us black women respectfully in their music videos.  Must black women always be oversexualized in videos for the world to see and our youth to emulate and by our own black Kings contributing to this bulxllsxxt is sad indeed. To proof my point watch the rude responses im.going to receive from my very own people for this harmless comment because i dared critiqued their demigod, a music superstar
Stef don did not do u good,ands it clear u have passed the message
The beat is everything👌🏽 Burna to the world🌎  Afro beats to the world❤

Smoke detector? 🤔😂 2:30
I told them @ don't complain don't explain just believe ❤❤
I just saw Mama Burna’s interview with BBC… It was a humiliating example of parenting!!! I feel like I am in an alternative universe.  This is definitely not the Nigeria of my youth when parents got angry at their kids for even attempting to use foul language anywhere. Normal kids, who are not cradled in perversion, are too petrified to let their parents even suspect that they viewed anything marginally X-rated.  I did not realize that Burna Boy had a mother who even listens to his music let alone supports it, advocates for its propagation and champions it distribution. This is a putrefying embarrassment!!! My level of disgust cannot be typed out fast enough … Has Mama Burna seen the video of ‘City Boy,’ HAS SHE?  This is a degeneration of values, morals and scruples.  It is obvious that when Mama Burna was busy trading grades for studio sessions she let him miss out on the valuable lessons of morality, rectitude and virtuous judgement.  Those young ladies exposing the most private parts of their anatomies in Burna Boy’s ‘City Boy’ video are people’s children, does Mama Burna realize that? Does Mama Burna think this is the path of nudity their parents hoped they would take?  Does Mama Burna believe this is the kind of accomplishment their parents wanted for them?  Mama Burna and her son have become flagrant emblems of perversion and she, Mama Burna, has the audacity to sit for an interview stating she wants him to play more stadiums. This is the very peak of lunacy!!! Just because of the immediate material benefits that will accrue to Mama Burna and her family, they are ready to destroy other families with the semi-pornographic music video that her weed-smoking, drunkenness-endorsing son keeps putting out.  This is utterly nauseating.   Mama Burna has become an enabler of not just bad behaviour but an eternally reprehensible lifestyle. Your son has become a purveyor of filth and decadence and you are a willing facilitator.  Remember, when our time is up on this earth we are all going to stand before a holy righteous God who cannot be cajoled by fame, finances or fast cars.  Eternal destiny is inevitable.  Ignore it all you want; it is still one of two choices: the path to honour or the path to horror. Be wise with your decision, it cannot be changed once your breath stops.
Wow, he is talented with this!! Congratulations burna

The jamm mad oo🔥🔥🔥

He a sexy yeh...sure is
🎂 🍰 🧁
The original afro beat creator's song made sense. But your songs don't make sense. That shows a lack of talent. Music is more than just opening your mouth for words and sounds to come out. If it makes no sense it only translates to a lack of brain power to be creative. Fela sang and it made good sense, sit down and think about it.
PLEASE LET THIS BE THE LAST TIME YOU CALL JESUS IN ANY OF YOUR SONGS THAT MAKE NO SENSE. WHAT HAS JESUS GOT TO DO WITH YOU SINGING ABOUT YOUR DICK? FOR REAL YOU ARE INSULTING THE CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE! DON'T GET IT TWISTED JESUS DOES NOT BELONG IN ANY OF YOUR SONGS. LEARN TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND RESPECTABLE. YOU ARE A MERE CREATION, REMEMBER THAT IF YOU LOVE YOUR LIFE.
Love the song but he could’ve did way better with the video.
Sounds like crime
Yeah boi.

🔥🔥🔥
BEST SONG 2023!!!!
I love this song so much . The intro speaks on self esteem and confidence issues . As a teen youth I had both and I believed I was ugly cause I was deemed unattractive by most girls . It wasn’t until I got older and started taking care of myself (working out ,growing my hair out ,dressing etc) that I was able to build my image ,confidence and self esteem up. Now I’m not undesirable by the opposite sex as I once was . “I’m not even an ugly youth I’m a sexy youth” 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Saaaaaaleeeee 😂 😂 😂
You have talent bruuh people know after soon but never forget your friend SIDHU MOOSEWALA..You are also a true drake for us😇🤟
Cool 🎉

Yes Burna boy ❤❤ African Giant

#OnPoint   #keepitcoming  #wish aka could ft in this
“The time promised by God has come at last!” he announced. “The Kingdom of God is near! Repent of your sins and believe the Good News!”Mark‬ ‭1‬:‭15‬ ‭NLT‬‬. John 14:6 Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. The FATHER is GOD the SOVEREIGN who is in heaven where there’s no more sorrow, pain and the troubles of this world however there we find everlasting joy, love and all the good things GOD has in store for those who love HIM.   Here is is a prayer of giving your life to Jesus today. Today is the day of salvation, the world is Perishing with all its trouble but JESUS CHRIST is the redeemer:   Heavenly and Almighty God, I come before you humbled and sorrowful, aware of my sin, and ready to repent. Lord, forgive me for I have sinned before you. Wash away my sin, purify me, and help me to turn from this sin. Lead me to walk in your way instead, leaving behind my old life and starting a new life in you. Amen
You are the best of the world
🤮

nigerian man
Who can tell me that this guy Burna boy is not the goat
Am a kenyan and I love nigerian music especially burna boy in particular but here is the truth;the afrobeat music is going down now I think people are bored listening to nigerians music idk why but you guys need to check on that.I think in the future people will be more into comedy shows than music cz most of them are tired of listening to current music they instead prefer oldschool type
He the most versatile African artist in Nigeria 🇳🇬

Top ❤❤❤
Let me roast this song since it’s too short 1. What happened to the rest of the music 2. Is it for TikTok  3. It should be illegal to make music under 3 mins 4. The banger part was the chorus  & that stamp part came only once 5. We need a remix will a longer version- hopefully the remix won’t be 1 min long 6. In football terms is this an extra time Other than all of the above fire 🔥
Wow
❤❤❤ this is my jam💯💥💥💥
Totally feeling this vibe.

Are these videos starting to look the same now. Im from seeing yawas latest (Bandana guy) and its almost the exact same concept, same cars even.. Thats why i respect burnas perspective on the afro beat genre, "its mostly about nothing at all. its only a good time." The hate he got i understood but he has a point.
i wanna see another collab with burnaboy and asake

Burna no need for those twerking a**bits in your videos. It just lowers the wawulence of your work. Stand apart from the competition bro. Your type of songs don’t need showcasing female body parts to show your fans that you are a hit maker.
So who is going to be on the remix? I need some ideas🤔
🔥🔥🔥

Burna Boy is the coolest right now!!! Not only in Africa 🌍 BURNA BOY

Have no clue what’s the song is about or what he saying but the beat mix & instrumental of birthday sex and those breaks with foot stump is hard… nice catchy tune , love it like the Igbo and shayo song.. songs without substances is my favourite genre

I apologize for hating on you man. I guess I am too self absorbed into being my own star that I forgot we live in the Galaxy.  I wish I was there with you boys, it's hell over here. There's just one thing I have to say though, the love you guys have nourished and grown is beautiful.  True and pure...I am so proud of una.❤

DAmn... My mind is blown and going crazy as I watch and write this Ive been hearing this song play like crazy at a club where I work and I have always wondered what the title is especially more since yesterday that I've just gotten hooked by the 'Talibas II' song  Now,after having watched a bunch of videos of him and Byron and Messia and other peeps and videos about that same 'Taliban' song, I just saw this very music video pop up on here in my feed and just instinctively played it and voila...it is the song I've been wondering about...  Hallelujah cuz shit is surreal and unreal
A Legend & more ❤🔥 🔥

Something that happens to most artists outside of Future is they first mainstream album is the best. Then they experiences change/grow and it's hard to find that first spark again. They flow/message change. Three/five years later all they can do is tour 😢 10 years later they forgotten
Banger ❤
Try playing that beat in your car on high volume. You'll thank me later.

Burna boy deserves another Grammy
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
You are not ugly Burna

How does Burna come up with these hits every single time?
The undisputed African Giant. Doing bigg things for afrobeats music. Keep up the great work. I foresee you getting more gigantic n becoming a force of epic proportions. On the afrobeats scene
The scene I wanted to see the most is the part where Burna was replicating Ol Dirty Bastard…. At the beginning of Verse 2. Director you don’t know the harm you caused omitting that part.
City Boy anthem of 2023 🔥

MY FAV SONG FROM THE ALBUM, FIREEEE
City boy ❤😊
Jesus is coming back soon! The Bible foretold all of the things that are happening in the world right now over 2,000 years ago. The New World Order is about to come into power and the world is about to go into the 7 year tribulation, which is going to be literal hell on earth. Everything is coming together exactly like God said it would! Yes, for the world it is a hopeless situation, but the good news is that God has provided an escape through faith in Jesus Christ alone!       John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that he gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.”       We are all born sinners and doomed to spend eternity in hell. Romans 3:10 states that “There is no one righteous, not even one”.       Romans 3:23 explains: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” We all have a sin debt that we owe God and it is so great that we can never possibly repay it. However, the good news is that Jesus paid that debt by dying and suffering the wrath of God in our place on the cross, and three days later He rose from the dead in ultimate victory over sin and death.       Romans 6:23 says: “The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” God loves us more than we can even imagine and is offering every single person forgiveness and salvation, regardless of what anyone has done, if only they repent and put their faith in Jesus Christ alone. We can never do anything to earn salvation no matter how good of a person that we think we are. Isaiah 64:6 states: “all our righteous acts are like filthy rags”. But praise God that when we accept Christ as our savior, Jesus gives us His righteousness! It’s a GIFT!       Romans 10:9-10 explains: “That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.”       Romans 10:13 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved”.        Jesus IS Lord and the Bible says one day all will confess that and bow their knee before Him. Unfortunately, there will be many that do that right before they go into eternal torment in the lake of fire. Do it now before it is too late! Jesus is real, He is the Son of God, He gave His life for us, and three days later He rose from the dead. To this day there is an empty tomb in Jerusalem! He is coming back soon to rapture every true believer. Don’t be left behind to experience the wrath of God that’s about to fall on this world. Repent of your sins and get saved now before it’s too late. John 14:6: (Jesus speaking) “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.”  Here are a couple links for further information.

If you are here in 2090, I was here in 2023.💜  In 2023, Nigerian music was doing absolutely well, getting even better every day and it was loved worldwide. We Nigerians we're proud of this success story.  Hope the world is a better place in 2090. Stay safe and be a nice human. 🇳🇬💜💜💜

I live in Germany. Trust me, there's no one of my colleagues and friends here at the hospital from various places of the world (Greece, Germany, Turkey etc.), boys and girls, men & women, who doesn't know and like Burna boy. It might sound strange, but it's fact. They keep playing his music :D Burna Boy is blessed!

Bro bridging the gap
After the video was done filming, all of those cars go back to "rent O car" company. Everyone goes back to the hood in the city bus or train, back to the projects. The lifestyle of a rapper is smoke and screens..... It's almost like magic.
I was expecting a little more 🤷 I'm a little disappointed. The song and the chorus don't connect
❤❤❤❤❤

Never let this song die coz it meant something special to most of us during the year it came out. Long live ODOGWU. Kenyans 🇰🇪 🇰🇪 🇰🇪 love you

I love burna just as the next person but let’s not lie the album is mid, burna boy rose to fame by promoting Africa and the black culture that was why twice as tall got a Grammy we all view burna as a medium to enlighten people more about the black community.

If you are here in 2090, I was here in 2023.💜💜  BURNA BOY was a young artist who came from GRASS to GRACE. He was among the best musicians of his generation & he was a living LEGEND.  In 2023, Nigerian music was doing absolutely well, getting even better everyday and it was loved worldwide. We Nigerians we're proud of this success story.  Hope the world is a better place in 2090? Stay safe and be a nice human. 🇳🇬💜💜💜
