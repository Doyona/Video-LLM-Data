I come here every year just to watch these hauls!! Love them
Wait, what talented to the Dutch oven ?
NEVER STOP PLZ. I hold onto YouTube for dear life during these changing times. Everybody else wants to go with what’s in. It only dies out if you let it die out.
Remi you have become one of my to watch youtubers! I love the positive and bubbly vibe u send
I also go batshit for an advent calendar!!!!! 😆  love you Remi! I’ve got my vlogmas hoodie ready!! Can’t wait! ❤😊

i just waited to see what candles were bought this yr😭
Can’t find the gloss online anyone know what shade it is??
What camera do you use? The quality is amazing!
I did my Black Friday shopping online this year
Omg I can't find the Stanley cups anywhere and that's all my daughter wanted for Christmas 😥
Where is your pink sweater from?? its so cute 😇
WHUT BUFFALO SH|T YOUTUBE sends!  Fuc]<0ff ! Blocked !!
Can we take a moment to appreciate how AMAZING remi's hair looks. ITS GIVING
Tacky and silly, ggs
📌  Make a video of you without yr war paint on.  Let's see yr tru beauty ! Bet you will not darlin
Black Friday is a racist term.
Wow  I love  your  haul.  You are so beautiful.   I love  WATCHING all of your VIDEOS.  You inspired me to keep making VIDEOS on my CHANNEL and to not give up.   Sending lots of love from nz.   😘🤗❤
I love aerie but I haven’t been to the store in more than a year
cant wait for vlogmas this year!
How does this crap even end up in my feed?
Typical sheep
You said Steve madden and Abercrombie and I had to check the date on the video
My friend has those paper soap things and they came in handy when we went hiking one time! I need to get some for myself.
Never stop doing these hauls 🥺💕 we love them !!!
BABE WAKE UP REMI POSTED HER BLACK FRIDAY HAUL
Absolutely will always watch your Black Friday hauls ❤
Black Friday hauls are my favorite 😍 I can't believe I been watching you sooo many years that's crazy ♡
aghh love youuu
Watching this haul while drinking my coffee and burning my spiced apple toddy that I also got on Black Friday ☺️ Happy Holidays Remi ❤
Love watching these hauls ❤
The crickets getting the thumbnail 😄
Super important question; have you ever purchased any of Aerie’s flared yoga pants?? As a fellow short girlie I’ve tried to buy some, but when I put them on they drag on the ground and sometimes go over my foot too. 😢 I want to find a really nice quality pair that also fits well, but it seems so hard to find. I tried some from Old Navy with the same result. 😭
Thank you so much for continuing  the black friday  haul.
Please never stop the ANNUAL BLACK FRIDAY HAULS!
miss Remi what is that sweatshirt and where can I get it
These hauls are giving me a reason to live 💕
I love to see it cause I’m still shopping ❤
Those stanley waterbottles are so overhyped/overpriced for literally NO reason.
The stanley tumblers are the absolute best i have 4
tea
I so love you, Cal, the Fam, the dogs, and the whole Remi Cru…..😂
GIRL SAME ABOUT SWEETNESS. I thought maybe it was form pregnancy but since I turned 25 I don’t like foods or scents that are super sweet like I used to. It’s so odd! Loved the nostalgia vibes of this video. I’m an in-store Black Friday shopping girlly too 🤩😜
she’s making bridesmaids gifts calling it
Remi I just wanna say i’ve been a subscriber since your back to school haul before college at your parents house and still subscribed to this day! You’re the only influencer i never got tired of following and I still watch every single video that you put out ❤️
I love Black Friday hauls! I wish more people would still them. It takes me back to a simple times
Babe if this makes you happy you do you boo!!!! We love it 💜💜💜
You and trisha for the Black Friday hauls ! Yay
thier is bowl like those containers that stack together just thought i would llet u know. they are great bowls
Loved this! So helpful 😍🙌🏻 and loved oli commentary in the background 😂❤
me watching this drinking the same flavor of celsius 😂
Camera quality is extra crisp!
I seriously look forward to this video every year! ☺️😅🥰
🙌
she is on the black friday GRIND
nothing brings me more serotonin than a Black Friday haul
If you need a good big clip to hold your hair, try the Toni Rose XL clip! It’s huge, and by FAR my favorite claw clip I’ve ever used!
10th year tradition!
I love a Black Friday haul! Never stop doing it!
Remi where did you get the pink sweater your wearing !?😍😍😍😍
i literally miss the old school hauls where you actually go to the mall
10th annual 🎉
I love the Black Friday videos. I’m so excited for vlogmas
Where's the onesie?
😍😍 Happy Holidays
I don’t usually watch haul vids but enjoy the editing on this one, team’s doing a great job!
I don't watch a lot of lifestyle vloggers anymore, but I always find my way back to you during Christmas. Winter Candy Apple fan for life.
I miss actual Black Friday. When the good sales were only on Friday and you had to get up and wait on lines. Nothing beats that rush feeling and I am over stores running sales for weeks beforehand. Now Black Friday is not even always the best prices.
Those hand soap sheets are going to be a stocking stuffer this year for sure haha
iCONIC MSREM BLACK FRIDAY HAUL!!
Miss Remi giveaway 👀👀👀 ????
Look forward to these every year😁❤
I appreciate these lifestyle hauls
OMG I'm still living in 2016 so I really appreciate you doing this haul every single YEAR 😍😍😍 Love from Italy❤
Defff need to get a Stanley cup soon, im 7 months pregnant and I get up every hour to refill my cup!! Deff need to treat myself to a Stanley cup
omg no VS or PINK this year?!
We love a Black Friday haul!! Looks like you got some good stuff! I can’t wait for vlogmas!!
As a bath and body works employee just wait for the candle sale black Friday deal is stupid
Don't give up on them! We appreciate them! This brings all the feelz and nostalgia!
I look forward to you and Alisha’s black friday vlogs and hauls every year!! 🤩 MY BLACK FRIDAY QUEENS
ICONICCC 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
😮 I fell in love with those turtle chips two years ago when Sam’s Club started carrying the churro ones. They are highly highly addictive!
I did not do any black Friday shopping out in public this year. Our family ended up having to completely cancel Thanksgiving due to a stomach bug or food poisoning we may never know. It first started out with us post poning & we were getting more and more afraid by each one dropping until it was just my husband and I. We are going to come together on Sunday for homemade turkey pot pies. Let’s hope this goes better.
I LOVE YOU REMIIIIII and your classic Black Friday videossss❤❤❤❤
Remi!!!! Never change your content. I am 27 years old and you never bore me. I just love it so much!! I can’t wait for vlogmas (even my boyfriend loves to watch your vlogmas vids) 🥰❤️
Back in my day we had white Friday  -🧑🏻
Remi's hauls are always the best! Thanks for keeping it going.💝
Congrats on the decade of doing this Remi!!I love these hauls!I'm older than you guys but I watch a select few hear on YouTube,especially since my son passed away.Yall are around his age and y'all are like my YouTube kiddos..Yall make me smile and thanks so much for sharing your lives..I can't wait till you and Kal have  a precious little baby..Happy Holidays Beautiful 😊 😘😘😘😘
I like that scent   too and have it in the perfume 😊.
Just so ya know, candle day is actually the best day to buy bath and body works candles. They're the lowest price of the season that day (first friday of december). But I get the tradition of buying them on black friday so you do you ❤️
this video brings me so much joy thank u remi🙏
I LIVE for these videos!!!
Don’t ever stop doing Black Friday hauls!! We love them 🥰
i got so excited when i saw this bc i feel like no1 does these anymore and i still love to watch them😂 great video, loved!

“A little lunch pale action,” got me 😂
Please don’t stop this annual Black Friday haul and vlogmas!! I’ve been subscribed for years now & truly enjoy this content❤️ I hope you had an amazing thanksgiving as well!
This comment should probably be on the blog channel. It was really nice to see your aunt. She looks really good. I know you've been worried about her. Can't wait to see the gag gifts between the two of you this year.
Love the haul! But also I’m very jealous because I worked all day at Aerie and it was so chaotic

I look forward to seeing this BF haul every year!  This is the first year I didn’t go shopping and was a lil bummed but it’s life! Unfortunately this year is going to be very skimpy on gifts but it is ok. 🙁

Im so sad the lifestyle YouTubers aren’t doing this anymore because they are my favourite videos to watch. I always get so many ideas for Christmas to ask for or to give to others. Thank you thank you thank you remi for keeping the tradition alive.
Honestly I respect the hustle of getting this video up same day. The holidays were a little rough for me this year and so grateful to see this video and feel like I get to hang out with one of my fave girlies in real time! Love you rem brought a little light to my holiday season ❤
