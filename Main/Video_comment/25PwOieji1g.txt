10th time watching this and still  there's no  <3 button. yo Dave nice necessities
WOW... dude this was some top notch acting, for real. 🔥👌
Is that Lil Dicky?
🌚
U didn't rap...😢
Unoriginal. Lacks panache and that 'certain feel'. Like all of this was scripted for you or you plagerized it while looking over the shoulder of the clown in front of you. Besides, you didn't follow industry standards.
lil dicky is rap Adam sandler
Great visuals great production

I enjoyed this but the end reminded me of how all these cars started swarming me today smelling like garbage
We got ourselves Joker.
How to sell your soul to Satan 101.   What profits a man to gain the entire world and in the process loose their soul.  Nah, im good. God has better things planned than anything this world can put on a shiny platter.
I’ll never look at him the same. This was absolute 🔥 can’t wait to see what’s next
Legendary
who wrote this shit. this is fucking genius
Damn, say what you want about Dicky's music but goddamn he's one hell of a actor
When you can’t get paid so you attack the “industry”
Awesome!!!

BRILLIANT
Protect dicky !! This about to bring a target to him from the
tHIS JUST GAVE ME CHILLS, lessgo dicky
Hot garbage
This is art
Impressive Though the executives are over represented by 1 group and missing the other
Not gon lie rap has fallen off so much more past year or so and people think 21 savage new album is so good.... I love 21, and all his old stuff but you just think red rum is good because of how abysmally trash everything else is....
Oowweeee. Love how he blasted every fucking one.
Lil dicky sold out for a shitty tv show
This is perfect
What the fuck. Yes please.
"Bored, I'm BORED" After a lifetime of listening to pap the music industry grinds out I 110% relate. Let artists be artists.

Always great!
This was kinda cringe
i thought the name said jack harlow lmaooo
The person who wrote this script. 😲
Don't forget what he's trying to explain.... FUCK THE ELITES
The most coincidental thing about this is I just rewatched The Dark Knight trilogy last week just to see this today, I am 🤯 amazing depiction of The Joker, and R.I.P Heath Ledger to the greatest to ever depict the joker on the big screen ever
Thanks for the time and effort that undergoes this type of level of art. You’re phenomenal at what you do! Inspirational work! I can’t wait to see you hit the stage here in Arizona!
m,hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
What was this ????? 😅
You snapped bro this is amazing 💯🔥🔥🔥🔥
this is fn great!!!! Didn't Know LD could rip like that #DAVE #LILDICKY2024
Didn’t mention the part where you had to sell your soul. Guess thats too taboo for the public #we know the truth 😵
Damn!   That was WAY entertaining than anything I seen from Hollyweird recently!
geil
Not gonna lie. Add some deep scars and we may have found our joker
A step towards the unconventional❤
Let’s go 💪🏽💪🏽 making 2024 the year for us

So damn good<3
the realest 5 minutes of my life

This man don’t miss.

Jimmy #Fishtank #Fishtanklive #fishtankdotlive

Amazing performance

Wow bro
Ngl, i hate LilDicky for a while, but his latest shit got me 🫣🫣🫣🔥
Ok bruh makin ah movie fr 🍿🔥🔥
This man makes movies about his real life...man's living the dream
nah, hes a puppet himself and the elites are covering their tracks by showing us this bs infront of us "thinking we know so much about the music industry" - lil dicky is a puppet. open your eyes to the truth.
I love that mental instability is the new norm.
so this is what katt williams told to shannon.. and we all knew “who” sit at the table.. these “standard” not just standard there are some dark thing occur behind it.. chapelle face it too..
Wow! Wasn't expecting that, but I am glad I clicked play! Let's go!!!🎵💯❕️🙃😎

Industry : Start Rapping Clown : I'm vanilla baby, she 28 saying I'm still a baby Industry : PERFECT
Subscribed
This Music Video is 🔥
Hold up in that Paul Bettany?
Dude waited too long to drop new music
His acting is amazing and so is his music!
i imagined that the joker was Tim Robinson and it was really funny.
This exactly the music industry note though
Heat son
I can’t wait!
a terrible front
Bro this guy can definitely play the joker he nailed Keith perfectly
You know how long it’s been since Lil Dicky bro
Broooo you are literally a genius! So proud of you LD!!!!
If only it would happen in real life. The leaders of theistic industry are pathetic circus owners. The real clowns run the music industry.
Fr this man wrote a new non parody of himself song I'm here for it
I really wish Heath could’ve continued his masterpiece of this character, and more importantly his entire life. What an amazing man he was. RIP
Suit case full of hundreds would be 2.4million. at least thats what google says.
The joker
That’s the dude from The Magicians he was the fox demon son
I wonder what happened to inspire this 😮
I am here for whatever tf this is.. Godam
Lil dicky is one of the best artists of this gen he needs his flowers
bro's trying to tell ya'll something 👀
okay bro actually killed this
Oh my god that was good. I’d watch a movie he made
Please protect lil dicky at all cost cause the FBI LOOK AT THIS Like 👁️👄👁️
Best album of 2024?
Im ready
his acting is getting so good tbh
❤️‍🩹❤️‍🔥🐐
My brain wanted write this off as cringe and by the end I was into it.  It's a fine line to walk when mimicking the joker aesthetic, and this was fantastic.
I’m bored 🤡
Oh i GOTTA see this
Fk yes
The acting and whole video oh my gawdddd, a masterpiece.🙌🏽
Crazy how he looks like Joaquin pheonix but with ledgers makeup....such good acting tho dam!
New Joker for me
Dicky as the joker? Well done, crazy actor
That room gives early 90's mall food court vibes.
Fkn hell... This guy! Gotta be top ten most talented artists out there.
This feels like a pre sequel of the joker! cinema quality right there!
Yo Dicky is seriously a great actor and if was given the opportunity to star in a big dramatic film w/ another star or 2 he’d standout and kill it for sure
leftward sloping penis just never misses
stage set.
little nicky impression
HEYO FIRE 🔥
the fucking performance.👏👏
Could of at least let us hear a sample of what it is..but im intrigued..💯
This is fire! I love the artistic view and honesty of how the music industry is.
Oh my God Lil Dicky shout out to you for exposing the music industry even though I know you’re Jewish and you could probably get a really big placement just because of your religious background but I really appreciate you for actually putting it out there for everybody to see #AYBMP
guys WTF
wild
Whatever it's gonna be I am here for all of it
Wait, so are all these industry execs supposed to be jews or something?
I like this clown I shall call him....Little Sticky!
Yo, this was fire!
Dicky wants to become new Joker or what? :D
This Might Seem Fun, But Their Is A Message Within
Oh, dude, someone give that girl a raise I swear. That scream was oh so realistic
W.
Atlanta Season 5 looks crazy
Excuse me, Is this the trailer for the upcoming Joker movie?
I forgot this man actually made music! Saw the video being reco'd for the past few days and truly went past it a few times thinking it said Lil Yachty
Where’s the song with Drake at
F%^K YES!!!!!
CRAZYYYYY
try and tell me Lil D isnt making this an audition to be the next Joker...
phenomenal
Music vidoes always go crazy
Who is playing the clown? Lil dicky?
a guy named lil dicky made an album called PENITH.. perfect!
The does not look like Dicky at all he looks like he gained some weight or something.
r/im14andthisisdeep
@Dee1 they stealing yo sh<>t my boi. Or sumn like dat
he could really be a good joker in a movie
Ts is hard to watch
The Joker + Edgar the Bug
Tom Macdonald is gonna love this
I thought I was gonna listen to music bruh
What the hell is going on with this acting from Dave?! it's so good, even if it is an imitation. You can tell he's been working on his speech for performance...it reallly shines through here
Way too many people think they can be deranged clowns and it just ain't it brah
No lie, he acted that out and all the rest of the actors, impeccably perfect...
is this a tribute to Heath Ledger or just a ripoff?
Of course when you're in a race to the top there are always the haters who only want to make you quit, left in the dust of success make them envious, their own lives more dubious, dumb, and curious really, if only more creative they could be less furious, why so serious?
The best music video story coming out
Absolutely cooking amen🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Was that Lil' Dicky acting?? if so.. I want to see him in a movie!
bruh....I know hes no joker but...the inspiration is definately there. I got an ever so slight drop of the dark knight with this, sprinkled with a dash of 2019 joker...Dont know if this video offer goes out to anyone, but im down. Lets make a video!
Wow I wanted to hate on this badly no cap lol but this is phenomenal, the acting is amazing, production is top of the line, and you can tell this had depth, can’t wait to hear the music💯💯💯
@lildicky knows how to please his audience! Mastermind behind the scenes! I love it! #ripheathledger #therealjoker
This man hasn’t made a good song yet. He’s on a generational run of mediocrity
Lil Dickey I knew you was a slave to the industry once you portrayed yourself as Christ on the cross in a performance things people do for fame
yooooooooo damnnnnnnnnn is this real let’s 9000
Wow. Wow wow wow. Praise Jesus Christ. Thank you for such art
The first few seconds give me "professional rapper" MV vibes.
Me waiting for the song to drop and he actually starts rapping 😭
Lil Dicky now possessed by the Joker
Idk if Lil Dicky can be horror
Exposed
Uhh, damn.   Who left the door open? 🥶 *Chills*
DCU got a new Joker!
This joker shit is outplayed lmao everybody wanna be a clown nowadays 🤡 nobody done a better joker then Heath ledger
Yo dicky can act!? Took me till near the end of the vid to realize it was him 🤡☠️
fam was acting his penith off
Feels like a mix of Heath Ledger, Jim Carrey, & Vincent D’Onofrio from Men in Black from Lil Dicky here. Great performance, costumes, dialogue, music, lightning, camerawork, everything. All around a jaw dropping masterpiece of a video. Bravo!
Lil Dicky can act
Quit clownin' around.
He is telling the truth about the industry
This was frekin awesome,  loved the performance,  but this honestly is so damn real and true, it speaks volumes about society in general and the performance industry
Thought this was a song but I ended up whipping out the hot fries & drink 😂
Well acted man 👌🏼
Holy Shit!  This is genius!!!!  This is how you get everyone on their toenails and want more!!!!  Can't wait!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dude i just seen the music video and now this long ass intro, bro this is art!👌🏽😎👊🏽
Dave you're doing what needs to be done. Keep going brother and don't let the music industry stop you.
W H O A
Sorry but this was trash. Way too clichè
THIS IS IT! 2024 starting with the most interesting video in music since forever!
The pun and irony in this video is absurd 🤣
Wtf
This performance was no joke. Bravo man.
Number one
Love it
Now he is an Actor 😂❤❤
Anyone else think this was cringe?
That is one of the best trailers ive seen in a while!
Damn this was good....
everyone is heatledger this heatleger that , but you didnt see the true meaning of this video he is spitting facts behind the music indutry, and their demonic dark agenda
ooooo 👏
interesting.
Nooooooooo bro!!! I want it right now!! .. I am currently creating my own lane in the industry. I'm so sick of this cookie cutter crap!! This resonates heavy Dick
This was so cringe
This is one of the worst pieces of media I have personally ever seen
The prefect ten seconds aren’t real but the real ten seconds are prefect!
lol doing the joker thing is so played out at this point. We get it, performance has make you crazy and no one understands you. Yes, you are extremely rich, you are correct, the average person does not understand you and that’s okay but come on. Wealth, popularity and access to excess has driven you crazy? Why is this the theme for every musician lol
This music video teaser had more impact than the entire planets combined gangster rap from the last 10 years.  And he didn't even rap yet.  Well done.
This is what happened when y'all didn't support shitting in Tokyo lol. Lil Dicky dope
This was too cool
we agree with ya fam, #NIR
holy fucking shit
I wanted the music tho ffs dope tho
🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Where is the music? And where is Lil Dicky?
THEO VON WILL LOVE THIS
Lil Dicky is amazing
But the music industry is ran by the same blood that David Burd has... not ppl from the UK. This table has the wrong accents in suits 😂
honestly put a performance on as good as Heath Ledger, I can see Lil dicky as the new Joker against batman
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
That was cold
lmao this is cringe asf
Clase pinga ahora todos los raperos quieren hacer una pelicula de una mierda de album
shoutout illuminati
I feel something happened personally to Lil. Dicky cause..this isnt him.
why does everyone wants to be a joker when hes a white rapper  :/ learn to fight
Solid Joker!
THE NOSES NEED TO BE ALOT BIGGER 😂😂😂😂
WHY ISIT A WHITE EXEC IT SHOULD BE A SMELLY PRETEND WHITE
WHY IS ONE OF THEM TELLING US ABOUT WHAT THEY DO LOL FOFF
This is amazing 👏
Really well done
already saw hahaha and while the video is good, the lyrics suck dick.
bro is becoming DAX
lil dicky as the new joker for dc?
Lil Dicky is the perfect next joker
im tripping out cause that doesn't even look like you, looks like you got jesse eisenberg to play you hahaha
its 2024, aliens are confirmed and dave just dropped some new music. Shits gonna be a wild year
I enjoy Lil D music... pause ⏸  #johnnyx100 👈🏾 collabs bro I'm that clown 🤡 off the street.
This has so many layers. Fucking awesome 👌
I can’t believe heath ledger was only 27-28 when he played the joker
Lil Dicky came back to save Hip-Hop
This shit is intense I actually have something to look forward to I feel like I just woke up and now I’m fucking inspired
Can we actually get this as a film, Hollywood sucks right now
Dude, never knew you are that great an actor. Seriously, that's good shit
Bro think he is Heath Ledger
Is this the guy that borrows Theo stories?
8:25PM//1-21-24
Illuminati
Yessir 🔥🔥🔥💯
Great Shot And Wow 😮 Scene Lil Dicky Sir 🙏 Its 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Lots Of Love Nad Respect .. And Rip To This Type Of Director and Producera 😂
Goin after his own people
Sheesh , You Killed iT
Wow
When will you respond to Theo Von's accusations about ripping him off?
🔥❤️🔥💛🔥💚🔥
It's a breath of fresh air when Lil Dicky releases ❤
😮
Okay, but why is Lil Dicky actually a decent Joker..?
wtf
🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Plz let there be more
This scene is tough 4real
I thought this was a music video..
Genius.
What the frick
Always on point 🔥🔥🔥
Is it true Dave steals jokes from Theo Von?
Something genius is about to happen...
u got fat
Coded messages
Is that the ‘poor things’ score ?
Dope af
Org suda kumpul duit tu mau kahwin p la sana main jauh2 🤣
Nope. Not gonna bite.
Love Dicky posting 3-4 full music videos in a 3 day span and thinking he can pretend to be outside the music industry circles.
Facts
https://youtu.be/StG9hmBu0Qg?si=YeNYQBYNXkz0XHDt
Dude, if he played the next joker, I'm all for it.
Man Dave you did great with the acting. Holy hell dude.
would this make gata batman
Who else thought this was a music video lmao
my man!
Got my little dicky feeling something 😂
Bro wtf! I’m into it
Like what can't he do... Im so tired of being impressed by Dave. Fail once. I dare you
this is really bad and embarrassing.
Wow can we say that he could be a good joker
12
whoa.
Bro u should just do acting
He did some fantastic acting. Inspired by heath I think but still a fantastic rendition of his joker with lil Dicky's own take. Loved it!
YO lil dicky needs to go do movies playing a different role than he plays on dave
🔥🔥
Okay so we doin this in order, *- Brand New - Honestly - Mr. McAdams - HaHaHa -Ally's song - Harrison Ave - Burst - Second Coming - I love Myself - Kareem Abdul-Jabbar - Going Grey - I met a Girl - YG interlude - No Fruits or Vegetables - I'm Drunk - Morning after - My D!ck Sucks - Still Freestyling - Jail - Hearsay - Hi I'm Dave -* We Good. These are the tracks in Order and if this amalgamation of videos dropped is a Sequence... i Believe this is it. (If there isnt some giant connection between all the songs, Then ig follow the joker trail by its release date)
Real real talk.100%
Damn that was really good. Bravo LD Bravo
this guy can act! this is literally the hardest music drop this year and its not even a song
He'll yeah lil dicky back 🎉🎉🎉🎉
That ending shot is epic!
That was AMAZING 🤯 riveting
I hope people get the message
This made me so uncomfortable.
The guy at the head of the table is 🇮🇱
Alright, d.. I'm listening🤔
idk man I feel like you can't touch the joker anymore
would’ve been a cool little add, if he grabbed the briefcase to stand on it to be as tall him 😂one of the most creative dudes in the world, love this dude man
🔥🔥🔥
Not Lil Dicky starting his villain arc XD
we need this guy as the next Joker fr
i mean i get that you want to make a "movie" or what not, but what takes it to becoming a copy of something else.  why not do a long form film with depth and feeling that comes from you and not someone else.  wheres the originality?
this was a short film , and it was great 🙏🙏
Reshaping the standard. I can't wait.
Shhh LL
This was so gooood🔥
Dave your acting is amazing in this! I couldn't even tell if that was you for the first 3 minutes...  bro keep it up
I love LD but where the fuck are the bars at my boy We've *been* waiting
i like clown dicky a lot more then regular dicky.
Deffz lil dicky for as the next Joker PLEASE MOVIE INDUSTRY 😂❤🎉
I appreciate Lil Dicky but I can't be the only one that finds this cringe asf, I wasn't able to go through with the whole thing 😭 Only NPC's in this comment section 💀
I just love how everyone knows thats its based on Heath Ledger's joker
I get it 🔥🔥🔥 So artistic. Missed you Dicky
WOW, WOW & WOW. LIL DICKY IS BACK AND IM SO HYPED !
Dark Knight Joker was the worst thing to happen to culture
Oh wow he nailed the joker. I mean that was movie quality
Harry ain’t messing with women
Ngl that was deep “The perfect 10 seconds isn’t real, but the realest 10 seconds is perfect”
I want the rest bro
This and the music video are perfect. Thank you LD 🤘🏻
I hope everything sees the real message he’s trying to bring to light. Music Industry and Industry as a whole doesn’t care about us they only care about them. Art isn’t their motivation it’s money and control. It’s time we wake up and do away with tik toks, insta reals and quick 30 second bites. No one has ever communicated meaningful information in those short bites. Let’s get back to real art, real existence. Let’s create and be free not mimic what we see losers doing online. Let’s live without caring about likes and all that BS
Genuinely a really incredible portrayal of Joker. Wow.
Genuinely a really incredible portrayal of Joker. Wow.
Wow ! That was impressive. Good shit man! Can’t wait
Yes dude. Fuck yes
Not a huge fan of his, the vid was cool, last 10 seconds were cool af
Unbelievably awesome
LIL DICKY IS THE GOAT
bro should get movie roles with that acting
THank you holy shit. THIS MAN TALKED ABOUT /THE/ MOMENT. THEY KNOW! WE GOTTA MOVE FAST!
This man have been cocking!!! So let us eat like barbarians!!
What a year man!! You make it even better
Christopher Nolan had to have a hand in this video
Damn Lil Dicky would make a dope Joker
wow, that's some acting! Superb!
Dave literally is going to get an Oscar someday - I can feel it
Kinda cringe
Hell yea hyped asf🔥🌟
this is fucking lame - unsubscribe

Tha Dick is back!
#PENITH lmao
I MISSED YOU LIL DICKY! THANK YOU! IM EXCITED! YAY!!!!!  😊
2010 humour
I thought the newest joker movie was just awful which made this video awful & unwatchable. 😔
This shit is so stupid , wtf is lil dicky doing these days.
Dude this was intense in all the right ways.
This be trash
Leave it to Lil Dicky to rip off Joker and everyone calls him a genius.
Perfect! #Combo,2 points,His powerlevel.Tear In my eye,Cause lol.I may have just seen god 😁
trapped in the closet. did rkelly call you from jaiil
Im watching The Dark Knight TODAY!
This song doesnt have a beat
At this point, make a movie bro. I wouldnt mind another Joker movie
That was fkn amazing
Haha yes the industry is definitely british white guys taking advantage of jews.    Right???
idk if im trippin but he would make a good joker.
CRINGE
Theo von came up with this idea first 😭😂
Video🔥song🗑
Lil Dicky is the future of acting 🔥🔥🔥
Not a fan of this song...
Waiting for that weasle to pop!!
The Industry is evolving…
The show Davis is shit, but this scene is cinematic perfection.
stanley kubrik type beat x
Like dicky the next joker?
Bored with this dude if I'm being honest
❤
This seems more of a series than a drop of a SINGLE
Bro why does he give off major Heath Ledger Joker vibes? This is great.
Dude thank you for this
this is so cringe
The whole video felt like a Netflix show I would LOVE to see! Greatest Rapper, Actor and human been of all time! ♥
1:12 ain’t no way that slide made it all the way across the table lol
This is the best day ever seriously in a very long time
This is such a brilliant ode to Ledger and Nolan while still being unique and telling it's own story
Well, that was entertaining.  Glengarry Glen Ross beginning and solid Joker after.  I would watch that movie.
Many before them but, notably  Dave Chapelle, Katt willaims and nowLil Dicky. When truth is spoken do you see how many people listen. Its because we have been manipulated enough from big wigs. We done with lies now. Speaking on behalf of America
Stay woke
Holy shit lil dicky making something good?! I’m ready let’s go
We bought in a clown off the street 🤣🤣 so true
Have ALL my support, Lil Dicky! I liked and shared all of these new videos!
My guess is that Lil Dicky becomes the Joker in Jail Part 2... and that's why it's called Jail Part 1 in the upload.
YES!!!!  #WhoUpShottYa   The perfect 10 seconds aren't real...... the realest 10 seconds..................... aren't perfect.
Your Art is noticed brother! Your so clever
STRAAAAAANGE MUSIC
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Soo soo glad Dave :) your music and show have kept me at such ease recently. Have a great 2024
This might be the best acting he ever done. And the best video from his latest drop!
Nice
So is the new HAHAHA video the prt ll to this...I think so & the shit is 🔥🔥🔥
I wake up and Lil Dicky decided to drop what appears to be an entire album on our heads!  😳
I wonder if this is going to be a cross of The Joker (who he "kinda" portrayed here) and Tom MacDonald's song "The Music Industry" which I dought because Lil Dicky wouldn't speak out against The Man. Especially sense that BMG is listed as one of his labels backing him who is also owned by Bertelsmann and KKR, who has a controlling interest in the label, which is also very interesting. But yeah, He has no freedom to even come close to speaking the message that Tom MacDonald's "The Music Industry" does. So, I'll be waiting also to see the result of this big marketing campaign 4SHO!!!!
If Jesse Eisenberg played the Joker
I got a feeling this man is about to SNAP and drop the greatest album of his career that may never be topped.
If you're going to break the mold, break it. This all fits in with the industry. How about you talk about the real dirt?
Fuck Dave this *ish is hard & poignant AF-!!
I absolutely love your film making and story telling and whoever helps you make these absolute master pieces with all my heart and soul they are my favorite above anything and everything else and i thank you for gracing us with this art
god
This needz 2b a full length feature 😐 OBV
Definitely best Joker sense Ledger 🤷🏾‍♂️ #YeahISedit ment it 2
Rip Heath Ledger, this was a beatify representation of his Joker character
Fuck em bro do your thing
Wait is this a music video?
excuse em waaa 🤣
In all seriousness, Dicky can ACT act. His creativity was always apparent, but his acting ability through Dave and now this is crazy
first rapper in history that can REALLY FUCKING ACT.  Go Dave!
Lil Dicky's vocal control is astonishing accuracy, they navigate through the notes with ease. The song builds up beautifully. It's a crescendo of emotions. The payoff is worth it. 😃
Fire!
I like
This is 🔥
This might be the real Joker movie
w o w.
Bro dropped a masterpiece
Talk about a multifaceted individual lol. Dave went from being a gifted rapper and comedian, to a director of his own show, to an impressive actor and now he’s even able to take on (even if just for fun) portraying difficult characters like the Joker no less. It’s been so fun watching his career evolve since 2016. He’s a big reason why I started making my own music for my small fanbase. Well done Dave! This was fun!
Lil D in Joker 2 CONFIRMED ?
Album is fucking 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Bravo🫶😹💜
💜💜💜💜💜
Should have done , Multi verse joker spin-off.
Lil dicky more like Lil Nicky not joker
Wheres kesha?
Lil dicky is terrible. I speak for everyone who isn't a lame
ayyooo hyped
Flipping incredible work. Real sincere emotion performed as a powerful act.
If this was some sort of a parody tribute to the Joker, I liked it honestly. Can't wait for more!! 👏🏼😂❤
Amazing
But where funny man music?
LD!!!

Wow. LD is very Talanted. Everything he drops is A Gem. Can’t wait to see what’s next.
He blended lil Nicky and The Joker 😮

Heather ledger and little Nicky’s lovechild
This was amazing Dave!
Man Lil Dicky, You keep stepping your game up more and more, this gave me chills, I mean Dark Knight chills, very good acting, the costume & makeup are very cool. I can't wait to see what you have in store! Fan for life!
Very cool
DEEP FIRE
You have my attention. Can't wait to see where this goes
Dude its like Little Nicky and Heath Ledgers Joker had a baby
Wow, best part of my morning.
Was a big fan of this guy, until he chose to work with the serial women beater that is. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Hello Dave, I’m curious if you are aware of the artist Dax? He also did a joker style themed music video. I believe his message and skills are something that might be a great addiction to what you have coming. Please check him out if you haven’t heard his name!
I’ve never been more excited for a music video
And lil dicky being a good joker has me weakkk😂
❤
Give lil dicky a break please he gave us one of the most top tier tv series and been working his ass off to still give us music and heath ledger is the best joker fight me we miss you man rip heath ledger man was a goat and the only joker I like
Trapped in the closest just lost the title for most epic music video story ever
That's was friggin awesome 🤘🏻
Not a parody but a dedication love it.
Lil dicky can act!!!
He's back baby
Is this Lil dicky's Audition tape for the joker ?
Jesus Christ, guy can drop bars and act. I would've watched more of that scene, man that was amazing.
Great Homage ❤
Damn Lil Dicky Can Act!!!
This was incredible
So God 👍👍🖤💀💀
Predicting what is going on in the industry 😮❤
Lil dicky is trying to show the world how restrictive the music industry truly is. Here he has captured the real prison artists are kept within when they reach the plate of stardom. Be yourself lil dicky. Don’t change for anyone my guy
God damn LD
he SHAVED
sick!
Yep I'm beyond invested
SICK SHITT 🍷💕
Dicky!  You gotta be in the movies, man! WOW.
OMFG!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Bro fell off 😢
This is art
Speaking pure facts here, also love the ledger inspiration
Welcome Lil Dicky's cinematic universe. 🕺🏾🔥
solid fuckin vid
This might be longer than the actual song.
I felt like this intro.. I did my best for three years to deliver a message I thought important.. some did- but with little to no feedback and I felt dismissed. I encourage the media industry to reevaluate their standards and raise the standards in their work.
Movie🔥🔥 this is crazy🔥🔥🌐🌐
1:05 “somebody tell harry styles fuck all the women while he still can” 😂👏
Exactly
Mix between The Dark Knight and Poor Things sound and aesthetics
@4:58
I came expecting a new music video. I stayed due to the performance. I left wanting more.
Listened to the album twice already....dicky is reaching tier 2 power god
Bro finally remembered his YouTube password😂
so this whole thing is the new industry standard right? like this whole act is what's in that briefcase?
Puts out this teaser.   That night drops 20 music videos. *CASUALLY*
♥
ive never seen a better joker. You may have won the second best Joker ever. Until tomorrow?
I can’t wait to see what’s next
Holy shit. so sick
This is great
Genius.

Meh.

I’ve been waiting for this album since season 1 I’m so excited
love
This was stupid af
I can’t wait to see what’s next 🔥🔥🔥
Just when I think I've gotten a handle on the metric ton of content Dicky dropped today this Lynchian shit pops up
He can ACT and make incredible music and beautiful artistic nuanced videos like this. The Legend of LD ❤🎉 congratulations on perfecting this important message! 👏
F*ck yes, I can't wait to see this tiny little shrivled up masterpiece. Masterpenith if you will.
It’s giving 1/2 Heath, 1/2 Joaquin🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Yoooo this better be a movie 😭😭😭🙌🙌🙌🙌
IM SO HAPPY HE DROPPED PENITH I CAN FINALLY LISTEN TO HONESTLY THANK YOU LIL DICKY YOU MADE MY FN DAY!!!
Yayayayayayayayayayayayaya

This is like when a screenwriter makes a movie about Hollywood... has that insider angst
Lil Dicky meets lil Nicky meets Heath Ledgers Joker!
He can be a good joker . No, for real
Woah this was rad AF. Loved the nod to Heath ❤
actual genius. his lyrics remind me of my poetry, after publishing 15 books i understand the lyrical structure really well. Aaron LaLux
Nahhh this was TUFF
Let’s go for lil dicky as joker in the next Batman ! This is funny asfk
Show me moooooore! Can’t wait to see what’s next
Why is everyone acting like it’s all brand new songs? Literally all stuff from the show
This is interesting
oh yeah yeah yeah
Unoriginal and lame
Did anybody get the message?
Well, the music videos for this new music will be dope.
It's happened. LD put the new album out. 2024, year of the Dick.
I liked it and skipped it to the end. The comments for Heath made it worth it.
lets fucking go
WTF! It wasn't a song. You wasted my time.
This was Amazing
Better save that money……… too soon?
This next episode of professional rapper is intense.
man cast dicky as joker
cant even lie, Dicky acted his ass off here
Why is this not at a mil already!
Wow ive got a good feeling about this. LD been incredible since the jump. Massively slept on
Man if this is the first time I saw someone act like this it would be cool but my god the "Joker" act is giga cringe rn.
Mind blown 🧠💨  This might be worth the wait!!
...joker ?  thats some edgy incel vibe but as long as we get dope music knock yourself out I guess
OMG that was so beautiful, absolutely brilliant.
wtf did i just watch
.... that's it brain is blank no words to describe all of the emotions I'm feeling right now. Can't wait regardless.
Well done
hello Dax? is that you?
Wait is dicky in the bid for Joker? the Fuck??
Gg!
Tom MacDonald - The Music Industry
masterpeice!!!!!
LD finally snapped.
💎💎💎
Dude this was fucking awesome
ive never heard more scripted comments...gay af
Holy shit, turns out Lil Dicky is a super talented actor.
The joker 3  preview 😅
Exposing brainwash. How they let it slide? Because it's apart of the complex .
Bro holy fuck damn it i can’t wait
Let’s goooo! Fresh raps can’t come soon enough.
What happen to brain?  Oh lost that in 2018
Penith riding at an all time high in here... LD is a talented cat, but he's doing a poor imitation of a superior actor in this. Hope the album is fire. One love!
Well this certainly looks like it's going to be shit.
That was beautiful😢
Woah that was 5 minutes
why so serious?
Nope.

Jarvis?
A Joker impression nowadays just comes across cringe af to me
Why is this giving Garrett Watts? Especially that but with the balloon gun
Hell of a cliff hanger! Get it LD!! 😎🙌🔥
woah
haha I thought this was a real life music video for your song Professional Rapper at the beggining. Your acting is insanely good, excited for this album!
There’s anything that Lil Dicky can’t do? Dude is amazing
Ehh
Joker
Creepiest clown nose ever looks like it’s got gin craters instead of blossoms.
And it ended with the perfect 10 seconds *chefs kiss*
Hi Dave
Who else was waiting for the beat to drop?
What a waste of time
Very nice performance.  I want more of this story.
I AM SO THERE!!! 🤘❤️🤘
i really thought he fell off when he started collabing with big names purely for streams putting out pop-ish radio hits.   the artist is still in there.
Remember when lil dicky worked with Chris Brown?
Ayo lil dicky is back! 🔥🤙🏽
"This is the industry. Where it ain't how big you are, it's how big you seem. Where people sacrifice the art tryin' to chase a dream. Then they wonder why their music's lackin' creativity." - NF
Slightly derivative 😂
Ladies and gentlemen…. We Got Him. Are new Joker. Would never of guessed Lil D for it. But that was awesome 🙌
Lil Drake’s The Gander collab is 🔥 on Spotify <3 GaTa
“You wanna hear a lilJew joke, Murray?”
This needs it's on movie.  I was getting invested
The new Joker is here. Enough said.
🌽 ball
I’m assuming Lil Dicky played the clown? Could hardly recognize him! Expected him to bring out his rap gold, but was pleasantly surprised to see this different outcome! Can’t wait to see more! Bravo
Intro too long dawg I'm at 3:46 when's the beat drop
ok i love the show and other music, but why this looks so cringe?
ok!
I need it. Now !
Stoked
Lil Dicky - The Music Industry
I don't get it yet but probably at least a lil hard
I admire the effort this guy goes to pull the wool over our eyes but everyone here knows he's the very definition of the industry... This guy is enacting the klf's playbook on how untalented artists can get a hot record and make a million in the music industry, hijacking a pre existing community despite misunderstanding what makes it special and having nothing artistically to add to the community is one of the methods, another is setting yourself up as an outsider fighting the system whilst in fact being a simple cog that helps keep the system in place is another very well worn way of getting noticed... He'll be releasing a single containing the names of neglected small towns and cities next😮😊
You are always a surprise Lil Dicky!!😂
That actor is killin' it.
looking forward to the full version on "honestly"
wtf did I just watch and why was it so f’ing hyped. The Heath Ledger impression was spot on af. Whatever he has coming I am here for 100%
*holy shit* this is gonna be insane I can feel it. Brilliant.
That room reminds me of "Control" the video for those that aren't aware of the masterpiece
What the actual fuck did I just watch
Why do I feel like I just watch the joker movie again ?
Fiyaaa!!! The are not ready for you yet!
what.
Fantastic! I havent excited for a album since the 2000s. Achieve that in this era with so much stuff dropping everyday is insane!!!
fun fact: the pause he took after saying 'but the realest ten seconds...' was exactly ten seconds long.
oh shit, finally new lil dicky?
This is not music? it ART
GOT MY ATTENTION🔥
That was fuckin epic!
The New Industry Baby
Solid performance.
Nailing the Heath Ledge Joker mannerisms! Pretty damn good, just that walking in with that body movement was 100% spot on!!!
she didn't start screaming until she was visible lol
Big congrats on this whole production. Can’t wait to watch the story unfold 🎉
ok so you ARE amazballs at raps but please leave the rap game if only temporarily and persue off brand joker movies please please pleeaaaase
Finishing the video with a 10 sec teaser.....GENIUS!! Dicky is back!
CHUCK
IVE WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS, FINALLY!!!!!!! NEW VIDEO ESSAY COMING
This and is going to be amazing
Didn’t care when I saw your ig post now I’m hyped out of my mind🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
that nose tho
I don't know WTF I just watched,but GOD D@** I want more of it!
Why so serious?
It's not new, nor innovative. It's pastiche to other better things. But Lil Dicky has talent. Looking forward to the drop tomorrow. But as a "preamble" to this apparent opus? Color me meh. A bad joker impression and "oooh, the industry is all a game!"? Ha ha... nah.
Yes. Love this.
Is this whole album about to be one fire music video?
wow great acting can't wait!!
Wow
That gave me goosebumps. Holy shit.
This is incredible.
Lil Dicky is the joker we need.
Lil dicky > lil wayne
This guy loves stealing ideas from actually talented people
Did anybody else NOT know it was Lil Dicky until halfway through. Acting skills on point.
Lil dicky is fcking crazy, and I’m all here for it
Dicky knows the executives in that office should look just like him but this is still 🔥
well that was a waste of time
Better than actual cinema.
Ok… I’m invested
I’ve been waiting for you to drop music in a while but watched your show in the mean time. Hope you drop an album soon to show them why they shouldn’t doubt those pen skills you got.
I can’t get behind a joke stealer. But cool song I guess.
Penith penith penith! Lol let’s go peckerheads 💯🫵
Look forward to this dropping in 5-10 yrs
still better than Jarrod Letto haha
Holy shit where is the rest? I'm fuckin ready.
This is so good.
Holy fuck I'm so excited.
This was kind of 🔥
Lil dicky killed the acting 😂😂 this was sick😂
So its an Album with a Story, then?!  Hope it can hold up to Mike Skinner's Original Pirate Material!
Your music is ass ngl
LD is one talented guy 💯
Are you kidding me? This shit is trash
This was less Heath Ledger and more Adam Sandler doing one of his voices lol
Time for a new wave 🎉 LD is cleaning house 🎉 I'm pumped to see what happens when real MCs start coming out to play
“ all you need is the new music industry standards “
Tf haha
I'm intrigued.
“Show us your act”   Never heard a line that more perfectly describes the feeling I get from a lot of new music. I feel like nobody cared enough to do anything about it, until now.
Righteous
That nose....
Top tier work!! 🤯
Hey Now. Thanks Lil
yeah uh thats a mood
What a waist of time …. Very disappointing . Maybe the next little dicky video I click will actually be a banger
Why are you so good as the joker bro? Holy hell
that Jack Harlow hair tho
OH MY GOD IM IN AWWWWEEE
???
wow. this is incredibly derivative. 100% what corporations want
Where can I find the 3 hour version?
dick wakin the world up! great job robert
best performance ever since this year by far
This is a Masterpiece!
I wonder if that last moment is a reference to woodkids run boy run
I hope we get the real Dave and not Lil Dicky.
absolute fire, as expected from dave.
Lil dicky is too underrated
dicky an artist fr
We got 4 hours til the Penith comes!
I'm sure the song/video will be solid.  But this was *criiiiiinge*.
🔺️
Oh this music video''s about to be fire
Take a moment to recognize how well directed and acted this is. Very impressive!
artists try and spread a prominent message, and fools in the comment section, talk about "this soundtrack goes crazy" do people really want change, or just enjoy saying they do
W
Ummm..... BLACKBALLED!
This slaps
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Yess! I love Dicky and I fucking love Dave. We need season 4 soon, homie.
Doing the joker is sooooo overdone. Cringey man. Wtf are we doin
Fire
Was that really him as the clown? That was pretty fkn incredible.
Lowkey shoulda been an actor
bro you are crazy for this WTF???
Feels derivative.....
I was kinda a fan!!! You're music is complete dogg shit!!!! Just spend you're jew money on other things please
Is that Jarvis?!?
roseixovere
This was trash lol
Is def was not a song
I hope everyone is doing well. I would like to share the good news you. There is only one God. “Within the one Being that is God, there exists eternally three coequal and coeternal persons, namely, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.” God is the creator of everything and, He is Sovereign over everything. We have all sinned and broken God’s law, such as lying, stealing, lusting, anger, and pride. God is Holy, Just, and Impartial. That is why when God judges he cannot let even one sin from anyone go unpunished and that punishment is eternal hell. We can’t work our way into heaven and our good deeds can’t save us from our sin. The bible says all our righteous acts are like filthy rags. We would perish if we died and faced God with our own righteousness.   The Good news is that God is also Love and Merciful and sent his only Son to save his people from their sin. Jesus who is fully God and fully human, lived a perfect life and never sinned. He willingly went to the cross where the Father took the wrath that his people deserved and put it on Jesus. Jesus paid the price for their sin and died on the cross. He was buried and on the third day God raised him from the dead. God commands all people everywhere to repent of their sins and to put their trust in Jesus. Biblical repentance is a change of mind about Sin. It’s an attitude of the heart, genuinely turning from sin to God. Everyone who repents and puts their trust in Jesus, will have their sins credited to Jesus, and Jesus’s righteousness will be credited to them. Their sins will be forgiven, and they will be given eternal life. When it’s time to face God, he will welcome them into heaven because of Jesus’s perfect righteousness.
Lil Dicky with them acting chops.
You know this is stupid and fake and gay because there is no security.
Thisnis about to be a zenith for lil D. Watch this be his switch up in flows too
Legendary lil dicky snapped bro im a huge Batman fan this hits 🎯 on s different level

WHY AM I SO SERIOUS ABOUT THIS ONE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
How lovely.  🥀
That was better than the suicide squad.... why tf could we have not gotten that instead of jerred letto bullshit?
flawless
Dax did it, now You do it. Not original
This is the definition of an artist, and so it begins.
This is MAGNIFICENT!
🔥⚡💯⚡🔥
The acting was Rough
I really hope people don’t miss the message in this. This was really well produced and shot. Lil dicky showed his acting talent as well.
Idk, Im just not feeling it.
The joker thing is so retarded
Amaaaaaazing
Budget = Movie 🍿
Lil Dicky, awesome acting.
He’s returned
I kept waiting for a song. This was a waste of time.
2024, the year of exposing evil.
We making it out if snoop dogs office with this one
People that are goats 👇
The professional rapper is back
Cringe.
there's no way he's finally back...
JEFF was HERE 🏆
exceptional marketing approach.
I hope he jus makes a whole ass movie about the industry. This was awesome
Am I the only one who waited the whole time for the drop and switch to music?
Talk about a teaser. New Lil Ol Dick??! Yes, Please!

How does this not even have 100,000 views yet??
Unbelievably talented video. Not expecting that.
That's not him, is it?
I'm jazzed
Yo!! This ish got me more hype than expected now! Love the direction!!
This shit is wack and cringe lol
F

😮❤
Love the vision. Just keep doing stuff different.
We got some big gaping holes, and LD is finally filling em
Wow!
Interesting

Wonderful
My only question is what the fuck took so long
This would be one of my best memories
THIS IS AMAZING. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS PERFECTION
This is so good. I love you Dicky

I was waiting for Christian Bale to swoop in from the shadows 🦇
Talk ur shit Lil Dicky
Who's here for PENITH right at release? Already sounds fire!
Bruh drop music nobody cares about the show
Great concept amazing premise stunning visuals a real fantastic piece of work and great commentary on the industry at large can't wait to see the next piece
someones gonna go "missing" by the end of lil dicky
Okay but this “joker” is better than Jared Leto’s joker. Even down to the laugh.
I feel like he might make an album long mv
"We all know the music industry is trash, but the songs bet not be"  -Me
wtf is this lol
Almost 10 years for a 2nd album? This better be 🔥. Wonder if he would make everyone wait another 10 years if all his tv sh!t and shoulder rubbing dried up!
That Joker performance was... scary good.
🔥 that was dope heath with a lil Joaquin
This is how big budgets should be used!
boahs
Don't do it!! Adam Calhoun, Upchurch, Nova Rockefeller and Tom Macdonald are independent artists!!! Nailed to the wall!!! R.i.p. Heath Ledger
I did not realise that like 5 minutes had gone by. I was legitimately thinking there was still time for the song. That was great.
He's giving me little nickey vibes
You should be the next joker wey. No mames. Lil dicky you rock brother. 2024™
bro. i fw you but as a straught black male . you aint catching me in your penith shirt
Weirdly enough.. I feel like this proves Jessie Eisenburg should’ve been the joker😂
I thought this was another Kat Willams post.
LETS GOOOOO
LIL DICKIE OUT HERE MAKING MOVIES!
Shit kinda cringe. It all depends on how good the music is. If it's good it's forgivable.  If it's bad I don't want to hear from this guy again
dicky u creative beast
LET'S GOOO!! Can't fucking wait, take no more shit
👏👏👏👏👏
I LIVE THIS. REAL ART
It's so good when an artist is famous for being an artist and not just following the ol tired blue print of: Go kill another kid, go to jail, drink lean and sell drugs. This guy is the exception to the rule because he's too talented, to not be famous
pin or gay.
Shut up and take my attention span
oh yeah lil dicky back
A MASTERPIECE IS IN THE WAY FR FR FRRR
SHuT UP!!!! This is talent. Thank you Dave.
when the nice guy loses his patiance, the devil shivers
Well that was 5 minutes of absolute cringe. Lmfao what the fuck is this dumb shit

It's story time, Lil Dicky's gonna drop some lore.

You're a beast! I really like your work ❤
Shit boring, rip dicky
What in the cinematic masterpiece did I just watch Batman?
Yo okay check it Lil Dicky 90's kid new age rapper's delight, we had a different street fight so many pog and slammer's in sight, dude just might take a break from flying a cool dragon kite but don't worry it won't bite anything but sick air too fly, oh snap, there is goes string broke, no stress though because my bike sounds like a motorcycle with that card in the spokes, no jokes 90's kids had it alright.
Love it
This is gonna springboard LD's acting career. Mark my words.
This….was….fucking…..amazing. Can’t wait for midnight

Good gracious, the Joker nod. Well done, LD. This was masterful. What a teaser video, man
This was the highlight of my day.

You better not fuck shit up with Robyn! She’s the one my guy. End the search for love with Robyn. You’ll never find better than her.
LD can fucking act dude. Can’t wait for this album to drop. This is gonna be insane
Dicky needs to do a collab with Tom MacDonald like yesterday.
First

WE MAKING IT INTO THE "THE MUSIC INDUSTRY" WITH THIS ONE.  🔥🔥🔥
Here at 34k
Lil dicky not the same….i meet him once I thought his music was good he’s a good person in general. But just to now know that he never cared for his music hates his music  and was only made to kick start his comedian career sucks.
beautiful work of art
Damn, I can't wait.
So not music?
wtf :o
Holy I did not expect this to be the album direction but man am I here for it 🔥
holy shit this is cringe
cringe
Idk beardless dave is unsettling
The title typeface screams Tarantino... Everyone's already mentioned the Ledger/Phoenix (80/20, I'd say) inspiration... Shout out to the location scout for finding this spot, and the cinematographer for the angles... But if the last bit is a legitimate tease, then please–oh, please–let there be a feature length Lil Dicky music video! 🙏🙏🙏
this video is jewpilled asl
You are needed and Infinitely worthy for Infinity or All That Is cannot be what it is without you, so THANK YOU for your beautiful existence! ❤🥰  We are all already unconditionally in heaven dreaming this physical reality together   You are Eternity itself   ⛩🌌⭐  It is almost impossible to conceive a thought powerful enough to create this infinite universe. Yet such a thought exists, and you are that thought ~   ✨  If you respect your own emotions and regard them with affection and a lack of judgment, and if you persist in allowing yourself to feel those emotions and to let them move ever deeper, you shall find that the gift begins to bear fruit as you feel yourself becoming more spacious within, more responsive to the deeper emotions. You will find that you are an alchemist turning disharmony into harmony, fear into love, darkness into light. It is a natural process and it begins with the disharmony, with the darkness. Such are the ways of spirit.  And that is why we say that things are perfect at all times, although they may be uncomfortable. Do not cringe away from your suffering, but rather cradle yourself as you endure through the natural process of the alchemy of the transforming energy, of the love in your open heart.   🌸  Self-criticism and self-judgment are powerful sources of blockage. There is within many seekers the desire to make a difference in the world, to help others and serve good causes. Yet, in that same general run of seekers there is often a prejudice against working on the self, for it seems selfish to be absorbed in the processes of the self. It is our opinion that it is in healing yourself that you heal the world. It is in learning to love yourself that you learn to love others. It is in finding compassion at last for yourself that you are finally able to have compassion on others. It is in blessing your own suffering by respecting it, honoring it, and forgiving it in yourself that you become able to behold the suffering of the world in its massive and almost infinite depth. It is necessary, really, for you to fall in love with yourself. Self-judgment cannot be overcome. It must be balanced by compassion. You are bound to make mistakes and come under the possibility of judgment. Yet also do you have within you creatorship, so that you are never in a position of having failed for longer than it takes for you to turn again to the light and start afresh. There are various techniques for falling in love with yourself. If you are present with yourself and become aware of the wide range of emotions that you feel, that may be the most direct way to become kindly affectioned towards yourself, to like yourself, and ultimately, gloriously, genuinely, truly, fall in love with yourself. Just as you are, you are perfect!  💎  Passion and all of its expressions— excitement, happiness, joy, creativity, love— are all different ways of expressing the vibration of your true natural self, what we call your “signature frequency” Your signature frequency is that resonant energy, that vibration that is unique to you, that identifies you as a unique aspect of All-That-Is of Creation  And the way you apply that signature frequency through passion is to act on your highest excitement to the best of your ability with no insistence or assumption as to what the outcome ought to be, as to what to come to fruition,  but to allow the synchronicity in your life to present to you the opportunities that contain that excitement so you can recognize it,  because excitement is the compass needle that points to your magnetic north, and by acting on it to the best of your ability, you will bring about in your life, what we call the complete kit  You will allow it to work for you and you will discover, very readily, very easily, that excitement can function in your life as the driving engine, as the organizing principle, as the path of least resistance, as the thread that leads to all other expressions of excitement,  and as the reflective mirror that will reveal to you what may be within you that is out of alignment with that excitement so you can identify it and bring it back into alignment and expand your excitement in that way.  And simply by following that formula of acting at every moment to the best of your ability on your highest excitement with no insistence on how the outcome should look, you will activate that complete kit and it will work for you automatically, effortlessly, every moment without fail.  As you allow yourself to move forward in that way, your life will become an ecstatic explosion of synchronicity. Very magical things will begin to happen all around you because magic is, again, the true nature of existence. Miracles are the natural order of things, not the exception  ☀  The greatest gift creation has given to all of you is that life is fundamentally meaningless—It has no built-in meaning.   You were designed to give it the meaning you prefer to give it. And the meaning you give it will utterly determine how you experience it  You’re a gift! Treat every moment as a gift, and you’ll spend the rest of your life opening presents 🙏🏻  👽  I AM affirmations...  "I am an infinite, multi-dimensional, and eternal being."  "I am All That Is and I contain it ALL."  "I am the infinite creator of my own Reality. I create it all. My power is who I am."  "I create myself in each and every moment completely. In each moment I make the decision about who I am."  "I remain focused. I express myself consciously, continuously."  "I create my Reality 100%. Everything I see is a reflection of me."  "I remind myself of my decisions in their full potency, in their full, committed form."  "All is well. I have decided it is easy to create the reality I desire and I do it with joy and openness."  "I am willing to respond positively. Creating my Reality, and doing it consciously, is simple."  "My response in any situation is always reflective of my most empowered version of who I am."  "I decide who I am in each moment."  "You all exist within me – I interact with different aspects of my own  consciousness, through seeming external 'others', and learn more about  myself."  "I am always the power, the creation, the experience,  the perception of the experience, the observer and the observed – it is  all me – reflecting back to myself who I am."  "I have the means, the methods, the tools, and the keys to make the decision about who I am consciously – in every moment."  "Who I choose to be already exists, and I effortlessly allow it in."  I am All That Is:    and I choose to express myself in time and space as an individual  called “say your name here”. I am the oceans, I am the forests, I am the  deserts, I am the jungles, I am the mountains, I am the sky, I am the  Earth. I am the solar system. I am the galaxy. I am the Universe. I am  the multiverse. I am All That Is; All knowledge is within me, all power  is within me; I am all love. I contain it all. I am All That Is; my  physical body and my reality are within me.  Separation is an illusion:   the essence of all objects are real, but the perception that they are  separate is not. All are parts of a whole; all are parts of All That Is.  Everything is connected. Everything is synchronicity; All one thing.  The world I see around me is an illusion created by the energy I am sending out:   My reality is in truth only a dream I am having and I can dream it any  way I want to. I focus on the reality that I prefer, act in alignment  with it, and then relax and allow the universe to manifest it in perfect  timing. It’s that simple.  It’s easy to go from an old belief to a new belief:   and make the new belief stick. There is no reality except that there is  no reality. That there is no reality is the “real” reality. All beliefs  have equal weight. I get to choose. What I focus on I experience.  Within my consciousness exists all vibrations of all possible and probable realities:   I could ever experience. I am holographic in nature and structure. I contain it all. My vibration determines which aspect of All That Is I  experience to be my Physical Reality.  Space and time are a property of me:   I create time to exist. Experientially, the only actual time that  exists is “now”. Absolute continuity of time is an illusion. It’s one  choice. In each moment I literally recreate my own reality – entirely  -100%. The present is the result of the present.  Any external situation is a symbol of an internal concept and has no control over me whatsoever:   I realize that everything in physical reality is a symbol. No matter  what the outer reality may appear like, I maintain full awareness of my  intention, trust it, and act in alignment with it. When I shift my point  of view, and my approach, my reality immediately transforms 100% across  the board. The evidence to support the fact that the reality has indeed  changed will be obvious...  💚
lil dicky i usualy love your stuff, but wheres the song? didnt think rapers did skits anymore (can only remember eminem ever doing it and you aint as good as him)
Anybody else was waiting for the beat to drop
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH SNAP
Art
The perfect 10seconds aren't real but the realest 10seconds are PERFECT!
yay
Nooo where the music, great video though.
🤯🤯🤯 Holly sht. Didn’t think it was actually Dave, thought it was Hobo Johnson for a sec
This is about to be one wild album
HAHAHA was probably the song most begging for a full release from the show. I'm so excited. "THAT'S A JOKE!"
Hesss backkk
This is gold!!! Cant wait to see the music video
Babe wake up, Lil Dicky just dropped
This is about to change the game
everything finna get exposed. from comedy to music. from Kat Williams, now Dave. hell of a 2024, and its still just january 🤯
The production and thought behind this has got me hype! Can’t wait until tomorrow!
This was utterly fantastic. I hope every industry exec watches it. I hope they actually hear it. They won't, but the art is still worth making.
I just know that this album will be so underrated, even know it’s amazing
LD is playing Just the Tip with our emotions. Bring that heat Chuck.
*waiting for the song to start*
That's a joke, uh That's a joke, ey  IYKYK
Was hoping it'd turn into a sandstorm video. Just him running away with a briefcase.
That was pretty good...lil dicky was the joker in this right?
Cringe.
Joker Dicky out here!
Love your show and music. Thank you!
never thought I'd see the day Dave drops again, god is great!!!!!
In Germany we say: " Eierhaut auf Gänse"
This shit was cringe as fuck... you should be above this
was there a rap in there somewhere?
Oh snap.. God bless big G! 🫡
Puttin' that DAVE money to good use I see.
this is garbage nowadays artist can drop trash and still make it he the proof this is pure garbage !
11/10 would watch as a movie.
this was amazing
#1 On Billboard
So fucking pumped chuck
Ehh.....idk
😂bro That’s hilarious
Ugh.... can't wait... anyone know if it's coming out at midnight???
Hey man good fucking job. That was brilliant. I don't even care if there's a new song. Make this movie. This is dope.
i see many people in the comment section commenting on how dope the clip/this track is, but many seem to blind and don't understand the meaning of this clip
that did not suck
At long last
Everyone avoiding actually discussing the material, but it's accurate. The music industry is a travesty rn, no one cares about art, they want you to all sound the same, and keep it to what's considered the standard, keep these parts no longer than this long, be like this, do this, sound like this, and it truly kills the art of music.
so he's the new Joker🔥🔥
Dark knight vibes
Godddddamnnnnn why the last seconds gave me goosebumps
At this point lil dicky is my new Drake on stéroïdes everything he does is gold and if I don’t like or understand I go back tell I get his vision and understand it, he’s the goat 🔥
Is Dave the greatest talent of our generation?
Holy shit his stage presence is insane!
Wait, isn't that the Butler Jarvis, from Agent Carter?!
Golunna be a good year when lil dicky drops music
I cant wait
fire otw
well shit, you got me hooked
if lil dicky isn't the next joker i'm not watching that shit
so.... the music video of the year drops already in January?
Finally
The video looks dope and Heath Ledger routine was really good
Tessa screaming inconsolably   But then immediately stopping once he starts monologuing 😂😂
i was getting joker vibes just from the intro of his back.
i need dontai to react to this 💯💯
The acting here was actually crazy and the production was 🔥
Yoooo, so sick!
Cringe
Who's here from 2026
love you dicky
holy shit
Better than Jared Leto
Somethings coming. I can feel it!
So jack Harlow's 10 secs wasn't real ? 😂
Over indulgent self falletio
This video is about to take the internet by storm
FUCK IT,JACQUIN DICKY
Great video  Your clown/joker gave me Joaquin Phoenix and Heath Ledger vibes, like a combo. Can’t wait to see what’s next  Plus the 10 second pause part, real.
I'm sure the clown's Jack Harlow hair wasn't unintentional.
Damn, now THAT'S a trailer to new song and vid. Can't wait.
Yeah bud, lets see it
"Never too different" as token said
Forget Dicky the rapper. Dicky the actor 🔥🔥💪🏾😳
Damn can't wait!!!! Bring it!!
How tf you gonna string us along for 7 years, then post a damn teaser, and then i'm still hooked. fuck
i was here at an hour
we love the earth
PENITH is coming!!!
I'm glad I was washing dishes so I can really say this video wasn't a complete waste of time. Still a fan though.
It's Dick Season!!!! (Pause)
dave burd features when?  films not tracks ty
Damn, lil Dicky really fell off
Damn, lil Dicky really fell off
Is that jack harlow
Don’t tell me the album gon be a music video cause I think am having a Og thinking about it
Wow. That was freaking awesome
Actually the most excited I’ve been for something new coming out for quite a while
Eerily reminds me of Joaquin Phoenix' speech about hollywood stars and the hypocrisy of it all
Is that Jesse Eisenberg or LD?
😢
How come no one is talking about the message here? Production and acting is impressive but most importantly hes directly challenging the industry in which his carreer exists. Balls for that and I don't think we've seen it on such a big scale in the music industry before
This clip says to me that Daves ready to branch out in his acting
Omfg🙌
This is going to be one hell of a ride.
yeeessssir
Lil Dicky is Lil Nicky as Heath Ledger as The Joker lol
Yesssssssss
Jared Leto’s joker energy. This shit funny asf
Prediction, Lil Dicky wins an academy aware for acting in next 10 years
Lil Dicky dropping new music is a 🎁.
Bro i havent heard music from this legend for years now, its all just teasers and trailers for series and movies or is it just me?
goooodammnnnnnnn
POV: you watched the pencil trick scene in The Dark Knight
My god Im ready
Loved it
I can’t wait to watch it, I hope it’s really a short rap film theme’d as Joker for real. I can’t even imagine the direction this is gonna go but I know it’s gonna be great so I support it.
Dudes a legend
Listened to this while pounding it hard.  Love you lil dicky
wow. exciting to say the least!
Fucking beautiful. ❤
God I love actual ART like this!!!!!!
10/10 LD never disappoints
new joker movie goes crazy
This was absolutely amazing. I couldn't look away
Lil Dicky Drops a new video...   *I call the fire brigade because I know it's about to go down 👀 🔥*
Brooo we NEED a follow up from "Pillow talk", me and my girlfriend listen to that every morning before work 🔥🔥🔥
Awesome 🤩
Damn Dave, you finna merc us with this album, huh?
I am an artist 🔥🐐
God damn get to the music.
No lie this is going to be unhinged
Coming from a true LD fan, update the songs. HAHAHA was a great song for your show on Season 2 but that was 2021. You'll have outdated punchlines. Please release new material!!
this is next levels of cringe
This is a bop
I thank God for you ❤
Dave as the actual joker in the next movie would be great
This wasn’t a song 🤦‍♂️
what is this man cooking?
Hess baaaaaaackkkk 😤😤😤
Awesome video!!! But i feel like we got left hanging!! I was waiting for that to transition into a dope rap! We need some music!!! I keep watching your old Sway interview where your rapping. That was such a good freestyle!! We need Lil Dicky to drip some music on us!!
Oh yeah!
Dicky just did the Joker better than Leto did in two movies
where  music
Impressive
God this is so cringe and basic, the 100000th joker imitation
Awesome!!
waited for the beat drop :(
There is a lot to be said in this one video. Im so HYPED for this ablum, he's about to change everything.
Wiiild times💛
amazing i cant wait
im ready for your penith brother
The Joe Bidden inspiration is on point 😂3:10
Okay… I’m ready for what’s next!
Ngl i thought for a good 4 minutes he would start rapping 😂
damn the acting is perfect 🤩🤩
I want this song played at my funeral
This is the most cinematic thing I've seen in a while...and it's a teaser for a music video? Amazing
I mean, I've never been into clowns, but this...... *sighs*   *unzips pants*
THAT.......was so unexpected!! Masterpiece. A true artist at work!!! I love your rendition of joker!! That was amazing!
Hoping to see some Darwin vibes on this album!
a masterpiece per usual
where the song
cant wait !!!! finally excited to see something comming out
"don't try to lock me in a box , that I have a key to, you will unleash a demon that will bleed through"  ~Poeticworld
this insane chuck, you're amazing!!!! cannot wait dude
Dope.
I'm all for it Chuck! Excited to see what this'll end up being!
That was fucking dope!! Lil Dicky been cookin
Free Palestine 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Why does he look like Robert’s Batman but play like the Joker 😂
Is that Brian Cranston randomly at the end?!
Crazy
a fresh direction. throwback to less than a decade ago. Absolutely crushes the performance. I'm here for it. Let's hear it/see it
This trailer and the homage itself phenomenal.
This some prime Dave and im all for it.
🤯
Kinda defeats the meaning behind it. Copying something that’s been done over and over and over.
This is why every loves that Lil D
Holy shit WTF im down for this!
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Sooo, no rapping?
I’ve waited so long
Awesome creation team,🎉❤
Here before it blows up. 🎉
immediately clicked
DAMN!!!!! SUPER FIRE!!!!!
Gave me a Joker Grin from EAR toooo EARRrrrrr :) Whahahaahhahaha
Lil Dicky's audition for the joker. He could do it
Bro I fuckin love this
Nobody realized but that Jarvis from Agent Carter and Endgame 😇
What in the world is this
This is fire
THEY HAVENT MADE MUSIC VIDEOS LIKE THIS SINCE MICHAEL JACKSON!!!!!! OMFG I CANT WAIT!
Have to wait to watch this until my break😢😢😢
Here for it
🔥🔥🔥
Did I just watch the greatest album teaser of all time?
I’m so confused. Is he releasing a Emmy winning movie?
yooooh!!!!!
why is this in my recommended?
Lol wut
Oh you're acting your ass off now 👀 well done Dave
I’m very impressed by the production quality here. This is going to be well worth the wait
BACK TO OUR SCHEDULED PROGRAM!!!!!!!
Nailed IT!!!
Master piece!!!
JFC this is amazing.
Just play the damn song. I'm supposed to watch this dumb shit skit for half of the video. You already have a TV show. Just play the damn song. 🤷‍♂️
This is the dumbest thing I've ever seen, just release music... your not an actor, your show went cold 6 months ago
unironically emulating the joker is peak lil dicky, unreal the fans think this is deep lmfao dudes too contrived to actually make an album, so he made a tv show about making an album should have kept doing meme raps over drake beats
Bro, I was a young punk when I first heard Lil Dicky. Now I'm 25 and he's finally releasing the new album. Finally.
First, there was Javier Milei’s speech, then Sean Strickland to a pathetic reporter.. now this. You could replace “record company“ with US government and the accuracy stands.
What kind of bullshit fuck shit is this?!?!?! You can't come in here goating the joker role just to have it be N O T H I N G! Anticipation and cliff hangers are the number 1 over rated thing in this world. #1 evil as well. Bold brave move here dicky. Bold and brave... I'm so mad right now I can't even function now. What a let down... this could've been so epic, but you cut it right at the best part. Now we'll never know what could've should've been...
what in the Jesse Eisenberg acting did i just watch?
wut?
Can't wait for lil dicky to play the joker in the next batman re-re-reboot
I'm excited for Lil Dicky's new era!!!! I have a feeling this is gonna be the best one yet.
dope
This is going to be the new age of music. Just you Wait! Cant wait!
New album coming?
This is GOLD
I dont think people really get it
Need a Zack Snyders cut immediately
We love u bro!!!!!!
The Batman 2 looks sick
I am fuckin READY
he really got the joker walk on point as well as the act
Parody is a low blow comedy. Copying cats from 6 feet under, see! Your message has been reworked throughout the century.  Why so serious! A character who had subliminal reasoning.   You! You’re a cheap beer. A poor wine. A riesling.
Meow
Keep it pumpin L.D. Much Love.
Come on man thats really art 🔥
Jesus this was cringe
The Dick Who Laughs
Jared Leto looks like a clown after that performance!! (pun intended)
New Dicky yessir 🙌🏻
This song sucked too much talking
Best rapper on the planet.
that was cool
I WANT MORE!!!!
Interesting call back to Heath Ledger's Joker.
this video is funny bro
Ayyyy.
That was good but leaves me so many questions.
So exited. Let's get it!!! Already know it's lit
Not what I was expecting but ok I can dig it.   Though I think it's missing overt devil worship and child touching to be accurate...
We just got Dickrolled 😭😂
Lil Dicky is on his Joker arc like it's 2019 and I'm here for it
well that looks amazing
8 years and still no music
Now that’s a f king prelude
Are you fucking kiddin me Dave. Lol I got hyped,  now I gotta wait and I'm high, you just killed my high lol
RIP Heath Ledger
cant wait to see your penith
THIS SHIT CRAZY
🃏perfect
this is unexpected
Can't wait for this album! I've already listened to rips of the Dave songs so many times before, they are pure bangers.
He would be the perfect joker
Damn that 5 min went by super fast.
Better Joker than Jared Leto
WOW holy shit I did know Lil DIcky can actually act this good this is actually exciting!
WTF???
I HAVE BACKED THIS HORSE FOR LIKE 10 YEARS LD IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE GOATS MARK MY WORDS I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS ALBUM AND VIDEO. THATS A JOKE! THATS A JOKE! HA HA HA, THEY GETTIN ROAST.

LIL DICKYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
First
this goes crazy!!
LD needs to be the Joker for Robert Pattisons Batman 😂
I'm a big fan of Lil Dicky. Although his joker impression is really good i can't say i was a fan of this.
LESS GOOOOO 🔥🔥
We need a lil dicky Joker movie
Wow
Masterpiece right here
THIS IS GOING TO BE FIIIRRREEEEE 🚒🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Damn Dicky
Meh
Bangin joker ngl
Wow. 🔥
This was WILD!! Nice job, Dave!
Is This A Joke. Knock Knock.. Why Am I. When's Supper
That's some reaaally nice work man. I look foward for the follow up. And I missed your music <3. See you around!

Uh oh :)  *eerie chuckle*
Shots Fired.  Awesome Joker performance

Is anyone else absolutely blown away by his acting in this?
A banger is coming indeed. The message is RAW. Badass production, keepin it different!
i always knew this man was gonna make it
New LD?! Heck yeah.
That's not the accent I expect from record execs
It’s like a mix between Heath’s and Joaquin’s jokers… respectively. Someone already commented this but I couldn’t agree more.
daam good joker in my opinion
Here We Go 👀
Wow
All you need is what? ALL YOU NEED IS WHAT I WANNA KNOW???
I am stunned and amazed! Wow. More D!
This reminds me if Nf story telling type videos
This shit looks fire man🔥
Nice 👍🏼👍🏼
Batman Vs Nobody Speak
Says we only get the same thing over and over and he's bored. Then rehashes a 12 year old movie reference
❤
i'm officially on the hype train. Hope the new music is fire.
What an outstanding Heath impression
That was wild chuck, can't wait for the album tomorrow. This gave me goosebumps, I could totally see you playing some version of the joker!
I feel like it’s been 10 years since I’ve heard one of his songs 🤷🏻‍♂️   Edit: last time I comment before watching. This was intense 😳
Lil DICKY THEY GOAT❤🎉🎉🎉
lil dicky you want to be a real and respected rapper start over from scratch and never cuss or use any type of perverted speech, etc. if you wanna be real if not you are trash and traveling the road to hell do say I did not warn you
I need the full release, NOOOOOOOOOW!!!!
LD's Joker impression/character is so well done, creative, and unique! Also, only he could make a Joker-themed long form music video and have it unironically be a masterpiece 🔥🔥
LIL DICKY AS THE JOKER IS CRAZY
I want more
Time for an album
Lil Dicky = Best Joker confirmed?
That was awesome 🤯
What was that ?
EVERYBODY STAY CALM. ITS HAPPENING
proud to be here early still waiting for the new season of dave
Exciting from beginning to end.
Dayum LD
The REAL Joker 2
You were obviously doing a Joker impression, but I kept seeing Jobu Tupaki's mannerisms.
he is like the perfect joker
This feels like something very real and the world isn’t ready for it.
This one uniquely fye 🔥🔥🔥 Nice vid and appreciate the show for what it is ✌️👏
Fuckkk, was hoping for an early song to listen to 10 times in a row
Dope
obviously it's the music video for that's a joke. hence the joker reference and hahaha
I've never been more excited for anything in my life.
The world will cum together when all is released.
😅😅😅THIS IS WHAT THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN WAITING FOR😅😅😅
masterpiece!!! real music is back
MOTHERFUCKER I WANT MORE OF THIS!!!! I love the Joker, and your performance was like a great mix between Joaquin Phoenix and Heath Ledger. I was expecting a music video, but this is just as desirable!
such great filmmaking talent, i probably would have watched an hour of that unfolding.
Whoa whoa whoa where's the rest??!!!
ART🤌
My favorite part is when he said "Its clownin time!"
So much hype!!!  Can't wait!

Petition to make Dave the new joker —>(like this comment)
I’m not clear on if this is a teaser for an upcoming video, a joker parody, commentary, a troll on people like me who got immediately excited to hear your first release in a while, or all of the above. I’m not displeased by it, but I also don’t know how to feel about what I just watched
Ho-ly shit. Some understands, some don't...or won't
Damn
Why?
This has me hella confused is this a jab at the music industry or a warning to the music industry??? Or both
Acting chops on show.
Love the creativity 👏🏾👏🏾
Fastest click in the west
Real life😢
Fuck these boring "First" comments, I wish people would watch the video before commenting. I didn't expect a Joker-styled monologue from you, but I love it, man. This is so well-shot and just, wow! Great job from everyone who worked on it, including you, man. Can't wait to see what's coming tomorrow!
Okay, what the hell did I just watch 😮. Can't wait man.
