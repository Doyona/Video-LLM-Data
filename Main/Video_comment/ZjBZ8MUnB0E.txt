Meee
O que prevalece da minha existência  Na sua vida, não encaixa legal É um fenômeno, mundial   Que a brisa que sentirmos  É a melhor esperança  No jogo material, financeiro e saúde   Se eu for falar de você  Para aguentar, eu vou ser sincera  É um amor Não é um amor  É um doce amor  Batidão no pilão da paixão   Nós se desejamos Nós compartilharmos Taí, peixe  Significado que vem de berço   Autor: Jackson Wesley
Who's here in November 2025??❤

I fkn loveee Dua Lipa, Katy Perry, and Tate McRae! Their albums never gets old, when they release a new album, it's soo brand neww and different.  But I'm sorry, Taytay's  new album THE FATE OF OPHELIA sounds like it was released a longgg time ago, and it has the samee music and style of her other old songs.  WHO AGREES OR AT LEAST KIND OF AGREES? 👇🏻
I fkn loveeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee you dua 😭😭😭
Queen alwayss
Loveeess, like, so that I can come and edit this. RADICAL OPTIMISM IS LITERALLY THE BEST STUDIO ALBUM! 2024 from when it's released to-

Train yourself
Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair, is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there And baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice  But if you really wanna go there You should know I  I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo  Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (training season's over)  I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right  I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands?  I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo  Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over  Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team? Or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go?  For someone to tell you to go You should know I  I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul (if that ain't you, then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload 'cause training season's over 'Cause training season's over (training season's over)

You’re not a good entertainer you’re just something they picked up and they’re just throwing around. I’m like no you can’t sing act or do anything. It’s like watching a kid fucking around. I’m like no you didn’t sell. You’re not that good. You’re not Norah Jones. I’m like no fucking way
DUA IS LITTERALY POP QUEEN

“Dua Lipa doesn’t just sing, she creates sonic universes that you lose yourself in and find yourself in at the same time.”💝👍
She cuted her smiling softly 💛

Wow it has an year
I love the melody.
🤔This song would’ve been the perfect one to give to my boyfriend before we got married. But now that I’m already married, I still feel Dua Lipa hits differently — so meaningful, so beautifully carried, and the melody just flows right into the heart.
Dua is a good singer, in October 2025 listen this like when was new🎉🎉🎉
10/12/25 I'm here !!!!! 🙌🏽

Could be that she took some inspo in the movie Malena for the part that everyone is fighting for her attention? I found it similar to that iconic scene from Malena.
Anyone in September 2025? 😊
really catchy song, i like it, super boring music video though. 7/10
❤
All those men wanting her, but she pays them no mind... we love an unbothered queen
The production is top-notch.
Blow my mind 😂
Well-researched and accurate.

I prefer Houdini and Training Season other than Don’t Start Now and New Rules
She is describing a woman
Gee.  Think she ever heard of The Cardigan's?
I guess this era's far from over.
The image of a man was genuinely ridiculed

She really needs some ICE ICE outside that place
I wonder is this about a certain football player
WOW! AWARD WORTHY AMAZEMENT!
Much better than taylor swift
I love this
iconic
I'm not really into pop music. But over the last few months in my CrossFit class, I've been hearing a song that stuck in my head the very first time. I loved the song more each time I heard it. This morning I looked it up and became an instant Dua Lipa fan. The song is "Training Season."
Listening...August 2025...great  workout song in the gym....like the beats, melody
OMG LOVE ALL YOUR VIDEOS AND SONGS¡!! FROM SOUTH LA 💟🎶💋💋💋
Türkiye 🎈İstanbul please 🙏🙏
What a great song. Always great songs to be honest.
Wonder if Bonnie Blue got her orgie inspo from this music video?!

I know two women. If they were in this video, one of them would have given the exact same reactions as Dua Lipa and wouldn't care about anyone. If the second woman I know was in this video, she would have fucked a few people in this place, and in the future, she would have fucked the others so that she wouldn't have any regrets. Even if she didn't fuck, she would be on good terms with all of them, giving them hope and so on. And all the people around me are trying to push me towards this second woman. I have a shitty social circle and that's why I want to replace everyone around me with new ones
Feeling alive because of her voice and looks. She's the hottest on the planet.❤

While definitely not her best, this era is still underrated!🙏 Question from a non-native speaker: I found nothing where arrow was pronounced like she does pronounce it here. Does she pronounce it wrong or is that the British pronunciation?
Pure, raw, feminine strength... on overload. You're amazing, Dua! You're crushing it, and we love you!

Cool Song !

Amo, es lo que necesito ❤
This infuriates me this song is not higher ranked in views. I feel like this is why most pop artists are risk averse and don’t do typically do more experimental sound. The overall public can’t get behind it, won’t make as much money. Sad really, I hope Dua continues making whatever music she wants regardless of the charts
❤❤❤
So good

Wow! I like it so much!

June2025 still my favorite song ❤
I was trying to find the name of another song with lyrics that sound like _"We were happy once.... All the timeeee.... Everything's going to be Alright"_ (melancholic song sung by female with voice like Lady Gaga) but instead i found the other song I heard on radio... Every song Dua puts out ends up being so catchy 😍 9:25am 16.6.2025

SISTER, COMPANION I swam to my island. The journey made me strong and smart. The first days were cold, but I thrived and learned. For a long time I looked out from my island, not noticing that my tree had grown. I felt hungry, and one day I wondered what would happen if I climbed my tree. From there I saw something, brothers, on the near horizon, the dawn of a better tomorrow. I listened to your hearts and raised a cry that travels through time. I feel you, I see you, I hear you, brother. SEEK ME, SPREAD THE WORD. THE FLAME IS MORE ALIVE THAN EVER. I FELT THEIR MUSIC FLOW THROUGH ME. FEELING THEM NOT TO DOUBT. I CUT DOWN MY TREE AND BUILT A BOAT. I SEE THEIR LIGHTS. I SEEK THEM. NOW I SEEK THEM. COME! GET ON MY BOAT! THE ADVENTURE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE REAL! I'VE GOT THE KEYS AND THE LOCKS. BURN, BROTHER, BURN TONIGHT! PARTY AT MY HOUSE! I'M THE DANCER IN THE DARK! LET EVERYONE KNOW! 🕺❤‍🔥🔥

Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair, is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there And baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice But if you really wanna go there You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands? I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team? Or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul (if that ain't you, then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload 'cause training season's over 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) Training season's over

The most beautiful woman in the world
Great song. She’s awesome. I guarantee the boys in this kicked her off the set and had an orgy with no women. Not a real man in the bunch.
I used this song to practice English – worked so well! 🖤   I even made a subtitled short on it, Dua Lipa fans will love it!
thank you Suzie Toot !!!

Eres Alguien a quien pueda entregarle mi corazón? ¿O simplemente el veneno que me atrae? Puede ser difícil notar la diferencia a altas horas de la noche Juega limpio ¿Es eso una brújula en tu naturaleza? ¿O eres tramposo porque yo he estado allí? Y cariño, no necesito aprender esa lección dos veces  Pero si realmente quieres ir allí Deberías saber que yo  Necesito a alguien que me abrace Más profundo de lo que jamás he conocido Cuyo amor se siente como un rodeo Sabe cómo tomar el control Cuando soy vulnerable Él está hablando directamente con mi alma Sobrecarga de conversación Me hizo sentir vértigo  ¿Eres alguien que pueda ir allí? Porque no quiero tener que mostrártelo Si ese no eres tú, entonces házmelo saber, sí Porque la temporada de entrenamiento ha terminado (La temporada de entrenamiento ha terminado)  Lo intenté Para ver a mis amantes con buena luz No quiero hacerlo solo para ser amable No quiero tener que enseñarte cómo amarme bien Espero que me golpee como una flecha Alguien con algo de potencial ¿Es demasiado pedir?  Quién entiende que yo  Necesito a alguien que me abrace Más profundo de lo que jamás he conocido Cuyo amor se siente como un rodeo Sabe cómo tomar el control Cuando soy vulnerable Él está hablando directamente con mi alma Sobrecarga de conversación Me hizo sentir vértigo  ¿Eres alguien que pueda ir allí? Porque no quiero tener que mostrártelo Si ese no eres tú, entonces házmelo saber, sí Porque la temporada de entrenamiento terminó  ¿Puedes competir? Ahora es tu momento Corre cuando escuches ese silbido ¿Estás en mi equipo o atrapado al margen Esperando que alguien le diga que te vayas? ¿Para que alguien te diga que te vayas?  Deberías saber que yo  Necesito a alguien que me abrace Más profundo de lo que jamás he conocido Cuyo amor se siente como un rodeo Sabe cómo tomar el control Cuando soy vulnerable Él está hablando directamente con mi alma (Si ese no eres tú, házmelo saber, sí) Sobrecarga de conversación  Porque la temporada de entrenamientos terminó Porque la temporada de entrenamientos terminó Se acabó la temporada de entrenamiento

I like the way Dua doesn't seem to give a sh*t to all the dudes there who tried to hit on her but would only gave her that kind of "training" experiences. I mean she's said it, training season's over, looking for something real and serious. That's the whole idea of the song, right? Anyways, love the concepts of the video clip overall.

Training Season by Dua Lipa is melody excitement at its finest.  The humorous and imaginative way that Dua Lipa is portrayed in a hypnotic and alluring way is also part of the music video enchantment.

Amazing song - boring film clip
🤔😐Do you know what the most important thing in the world is🌎🌍 to do? It's not making money,💰💰 it's not eating,🎂🍰 or drinking,🍷🍾 much less playing games.♠♣♟ We came into this world with nothing, and we will leave it with nothing. Here everything is temporary, but on the other side everything is eternal. So the most important thing is to follow God, read the Bible, attend an evangelical church and prepare yourself for that day that you don't know when it will come; otherwise, you will descend with the other👺 into a suffering that will never end.😰😭😫
The amount of thirst in this video is insane
Are you someone who I can give my heart too or should I have tried calling the no nouns who aren't true like the no names are now like the gun is a gain gone a bit too far for the glue to be the game is a gown worn all wrong when the truth is especially the wrong way to move especially when the fun is about to burst through to the way you tuck into the way it hurts you and you should shut up and it is out of the way for the truth is a lobg way through to the door is a wiindow turned into a well enough bruise is as known as the new as real as a burnt enough times to be true as a well is a right as rain is a tune to tight  to tame is the real as raw as the hell is the train so loose to feel the hot of a way to be going to fast as the nice isn't a nay and the knowing of the blue flame is the ice in my vains that's kicks ars to the track where the wars is the last place where I would wear what I would have worn is the hat of a glass plate where I know I am to cool for that and I ask myself is the ace I hold in my hands is no fool to paste and feel the feet that taps and throws up a real taste of a beat that raps around the girls I know who reaps the rewards of get out of the way of being harmed and that's them being a aunt that ain't neat to see the way to go on with the real red star to the East is now to the Eastern part of the bay of plenty who hits hards and that's plenty for me as a plan for me to eat to the west of the place where we would meet especially when you are a bit too much to gentle the bit too far from my home is a rush hour to rest my case to say the least is the best way we speak about the day I would love to moke you the way I meeve you the way of how smoke can lead you away from the deep south on patrol on your knees now and when you say please that's the clown posse who pose for the fun to be free for the big dollars for absolutely nothing is the fee

Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair, is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there And baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice But if you really wanna go there You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands? I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team? Or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul (if that ain't you, then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload 'cause training season's over 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) Training season's over
My sister would love this song

Happy birthday to Training Season, which turned one year old on February 15, 2025. I can’t believe this song is already a year old! It feels like it was just yesterday when this beautiful piece of art was released. I still remember how excited I was, waiting for its release - and now… it’s been a whole YEAR! 🤯🤯🤯

When I was a soldier in the Turkish army, smartphones were forbidden, and when I came back from guard at 1 a.m., I would always turn on the radio and wait for Dua Lipa to come out, and this song had just come out at that time. Thank you Dua Lipa for giving us this pleasure.
🤨
This maybe is one of the best vids of her ever ! Otherwise, great song. ❤
I know it's a video, but I'm worried about seeing her surrounded by all those creeps.
The best
The groooove😊

Love love loveee this song ❤❤❤
I love this song
Letra: Ah, mas eles estão todos me querendo mas sou uma menina má e não vou facilitar Sei que sou o desejo de todos eles Sei que as companheiras deles não são tão gostosa como eu Sei que nos seus sonhos sou eu quem apareço Sei que nunca vão achar outra igual a mim Se todas esses olhares fosse uma piroca dentro de mim hoje eu estaria com a profissão da mia  Refrão: Eles estão me querendo Estão querendo macetar a minha pepequinha Não sei se vou conseguir me controlar  Me faço de difícil mas só queria ter meu vazio preenchido  Acho que hoje eles não escapam  Será que as mulheres deles tem ciúmes?  Letra: Eu só queria tomar meu chá em paz Mas hoje acho que eu vou poder escolher variados tipos de chá Essa lanchonete as vezes me parece uma barbearia será que não gostam de mulheres e eu estou sendo inconveniente? Amanhã cedo vou mandar o curriculum da minha irmã Ela está a meses precisando de um chá  Refrão: Eles estão me querendo Estão querendo macetar a minha pepequinha Não sei se vou conseguir me controlar  Me faço de difícil mas só queria ter meu vazio preenchido  Acho que hoje eles não escapam  Será que as mulheres deles tem ciúmes?  Letra: Certa vez eu passei por aqui e não tinha essa quantidade de chá no cardápio Estou achando que eu vou ser as rosquinhas hoje pois faz tempo que eu pedi Me desejam assim hoje mas até alguns anos atrás esse chá não era dos seus paladar  Agora que cresci faço questão de tomar chá nessa ''barbearia''   Refrão: Eles estão me querendo Estão querendo macetar a minha pepequinha Não sei se vou conseguir me controlar  Me faço de difícil mas só queria ter meu vazio preenchido  Acho que hoje eles não escapam  Será que as mulheres deles tem ciúmes? Eu faço questão de descobrir isso

Great voice and music
Por que siento que suena igual a baby de clean bandit
O. M. G. Watch the episodes of Swarm that's she's in. I was Hella impressed by her acting ability and just presence she had...but anyhoo. I can see her playing Dagger of cloak and dagger maybe, or the stepford cuckoos, but then I think she's a Tom boy and not so much a girly, girly (for the most part) so I was thinking maybe Calysto or a part of the Shi'ar Empire
Voce calda bellissimo sound,fantastica Dua Lipa
Very lovely woman 😍💕🌹😘

Why does the beat sound like Morgan wallens new song “love somebody” ?! 🤔
Who came here after tiny desk?

A Dua Lipa amo y respeto, igual ella tiene que besar mano a La Madrina, pero así son las cosas en todas Las Familias y sus redes.

This is dumb hard. Dua Lipa is the only pop I’m into
Who’s here in 2048?
Merci pour cette vidéo. A regarder et écouter sans modération en 2044 comme en 2024. Ce morceau est candidat pour rentrer sur ma playlist "1000 tops".
Pue sa mère le clip
This song sadly has none of tze energy it would like to have.   The lyrics make no sense. The switches between the different parts are a mess. It sounds like they had a hook and couldn't really build a song around it but decided to go with it anyhow.
Can't afford it basically - needed doing years ago.. Did cheek on Tenerife during Covid at Dracula's Castle..
Skin. Pigmentation doesn't seem to be a problem.. Main issue..
Today I know that I died But as I am a phoenix bird Rebirth from the ashes I know you wanted to see me kissing your friend  To break up with me  But I've done this before Listen to the audio in your messages   Knight never was I was cheated, I'm tired of being cheated on with my friend Now I know you're the jester    Today I know that I died But as I am a phoenix bird Rebirth from the ashes I know you wanted to see me kissing your friend  Now I found a new love I have the posture of a queen and he is the king  Composer: Jackson Wesley
From movie :Dua we do not need washing machine,  we will go in the bath 🛁 with our clothes on, they will become wet on us, we will take it out, the same in the bath, after you know, we will be washing machine😅😊 Only have to leave them to become dry😊
The sunset is beautiful With you by my side my day becomes even more beautiful I love you boy woman I love you boy woman  You know my innocence  You know my delicacy  You know more than my parents  Holding my hand Let's have ice cream  Pass by bike  But later you compose that song  That you sang I embraced the chorus it's beautiful Works like a medicine   Peace peace peace peace In my heart   Peace peace peace peace In my heart   Peace peace peace peace In my heart   Composer: Jackson Wesley
The word doesn't fit in a verse  A word fits into a kiss I have no marks of longing I take my guitar  For you to touch  I sing that song   That we love so much  About the story of life, peace, heart pulls the right and left hand of longing   That we love so much  About the story of life, peace, heart pulls the right and left hand of longing  The word doesn't fit in a verse  A word fits into a kiss I have no marks of longing I take my guitar  For you to touch  I sing that song   That we love so much  About the story of life, peace, heart pulls the right and left hand of longing  Composer: Jackson Wesley
I'm sad to have it like this At worst  Me in a good life Comfortable life  We are an infallible duo   A duo that loves fame, money and jewelry  Today I'm wearing a wedding dress  And you in formal clothes  It's beautiful It's perfect   Nobody cares, but us  They're all muggles So I prefer to live a life without carrying the burden of distrust  Thinking that your and my wealth comes from theft  But I always tell them  It comes from love  It comes from love  It comes from love  Wealth, fame, money  It comes from my love that I have for him and he has for me  Composer: Jackson Wesley
Calm down baby  I stopped being a saint Now I'm going to make one with you  Turn your back Desvira gives my transvestite friend a kiss   Or, or, Oh OH Calm down baby   So you're too fast  I'm thinking you prefer her to her   Just to make fun of you idiot   Keep paying like a man Wanting to have sex with me  But when it's time to have sex, run Pretend you're going to football  Pretend you're with friends  I already realized you don't want anything to do with me   Bye bye baby   Composer: Jackson Wesley

WE HAVE A PROJECT FOR 3 YEARS BUT FOR ME IS LIKE ONE DAY I KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO
- 24 +
MOVIE 18+ -24 : I walk on streets lisening your music between me a car, it is day , windows 🪟  of car is very clear , inside is nobody, but the car was switch on with lights on. I thought inside is nobody but the car has moves like someone is in a bed. I seen it car has slow moves from left to right
You can change these lyrics, and I'll send them to you... in the comments of your Instagram photos and in the comments on YouTube... okay?! Kisses beautiful... ...  Att; Jackson Wesley
I told you from my gate, in the community... sing without dancing. Transmits more audience... Singing well behaved and transmits more emotion... hug... my dear.   Att; Jackson Wesley

Wrong expectations bring pain so I don't expect you can be my Love
DUA I had many times Dejaviu its a good felling, where it comes from, it comes from somewhere, why we can not be in that state of mind everytime 😊
DUA future do not exist , there are only our actions wich we are doing, can we go for date in town😊
DUA, what is your future positive expectation that will make you feel happy 😊 I realize one of it today,  I eat one of my favorite food 😍 I think about next

The warmth of our love  Reflect in the mirror The warmth of our union  A thousand kisses with tongue A thousand kisses flavored with honey A thousand kisses with a hot sex   Not for Purai, no I've known you for decades  Passion expanded through our body Our bodies combine Seal yourself from those from the past to the present time From the past Up to the present time  Or or or or Eeeeeeee Or or or or aaaaaaaa  From the past Up to the present time   Composer: Jackson Wesley

Dua, did you thought why your youtube account image is on your the left, why it can not be on the right, why our avatar do not move
DUA DID YOU THOUGHT WHY WE CAN NOT USE OUR HANDS IN THE SAMEWAY, SOMETHING WRONG IN THE MATRIX, WE HAVE TO FIND IT
DUA ADD ME ON THE MUTE MODE, IF I WILL WRITE MORE 1 000 COMMENTS IT CAN DSICOMFORT YOUR FOLLOWERS 😅😊
SOMETIMES EVERYTIME INFORMATION IS UNDERSTOOD WRONG 😮

He's in my sights The man so desired  And few women appreciate it  Aim for value in gold  Forget about the beauty of my man  Yesterday I wrote him a letter, informing him that I will come and pick him up soon. He is eternal My only root love That rooted your heart in my heart called love  The flame of attraction The flame of passion  The flame of sex  The couple's flame is pink with a red tone   Composer: Jackson Wesley
I look into your eyes  From the photograph, I realized that you haven't changed at all  The wonder is that you are by my side To dig up our heart  My mind is so close to you that even the hair on my arms stands on end   He started typing a huge text reporting our affection, our cart That we have with each other   Composer: Jackson Wesley
Calm down baby  I stopped being a saint Now I'm going to make one with you  Turn your back Desvira gives my transvestite friend a kiss   Or, or, Oh OH Calm down baby   So you're too fast  I'm thinking you prefer her to her   Just to make fun of you idiot   Keep paying like a man Wanting to have sex with me  But when it's time to have sex, run Pretend you're going to football  Pretend you're with friends  I already realized you don't want anything to do with me   Bye bye baby   Composer: Jackson Wesley

In a flood, the headlights are on  Our love inside a car Me singing and you pulling the hook   Love takes me  Love takes me Love takes me  To go on a crazy ride  And stop for a delicious spicy snack  Same as our sex The more I ate the snack and looked at it, memories came back of our first kiss. Sex remember? Me either I love you baby   Composer: Jackson Wesley

Ruinatio Imperii Romani fuit effectus processuum complexorum, qui tam interna problemata quam externa pericula complectebantur. Fuit exitus multorum annorum debilitatis oeconomiae, destabilisationis politicae, corruptionis moralis et militaris, necnon incrementi periculorum externorum, praesertim sub forma incursionum barbarorum. Complexitas huius processus efficit ut historici adhuc causas exactas ruinae unius ex maximis imperiis in historia perscrutentur et disputent.

I wouldn't touch you with a 10 foot pool.  You will never know love because you are a narcissist.  Literally like 99% of the population wouldn't know who you were so if you want to find a good man you could, but again you are a narcissist.

Dua has made a great video once again! ❤ Although, the video depicts a depressing trend- too many people are competing. 😔😭 Also the chaotic scenes.  Still a great song though. Dua ❤🖤 🇦🇱 🌟
this video is reality in 2024.  500 guys competing for the attention of the one available girl...and she's not interested in any of them
is it only me who thinks she dated only black men ? I mean based on voice mails. Peace out
She's really saving pop music once again 👏❤

2 words 6 letters pick me instead of Training season it should be pick me        Not to be a hater
This fcking girl never misses discovered her on the radio about 2018 2019 looked her up and ever since then I fell in love she keeps reinventing herself it’s crazy
هيه حلوه بس. فيها كلمات مش سبايسي

Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair is that a compass in your nature?
The man she's looking for sounds just like me 😛
This isn't the message you think, but still a banger

Training season's over
Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair, is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there And baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice But if you really wanna go there You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands? I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team? Or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul (if that ain't you, then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload 'cause training season's over 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) Training season's over

hola. i really think you are pretty. would you like to be a friend and meet up? like here at home. =) i will have soundcloud up soon
She is the new queen of pop❤❤❤ diva i love it 😂🎉🎉
She just got her own way  She can tell a nice story in a nice way
love you
Too me a long time to find this song❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Quite an enjoyable video, I liked it. Dressed to impress, light make up. It represents today's hard reality for women who wanna settle. I don't know if you're just pretending in the video or it is really you (which I wouldn't be too surprised, considering how many men would be all over you...), but the message is transmitted loud and clear.
I really like the mixes of her songs, anyone know who does them?
The synth got me feeling vertigo
I listen to pop because of her ❤❤
you looks like ariel mermaid disney princess
Top clip has it or the radio in the car
Very good Albanian Singer Girl

😍 Me gustó ❤
0:54  0:59
this song makes me realize how much anxiety i have when in a relationship. you get this feeling that you’re thoughts are clouding everything. and you have this person who cares and listens and that’s all you ever wanted. i’m dealing with that right now and this song just helps me to let loose about it. i love my boyfriend and he knows ive been hurt and when im in shutdown mode, he makes it easier. i didn’t even have to teach him, he just knew what to do and that feels good. thank you dua for always making music that says what you need in a more fun way. not a sad way which is what we’re so used to. stay healthy and happy everyone ❤
Доброе утро любимая люблю тебя Максим❤

The scene where all the guys are circling around Dua in combination with the way the music sounds just makes me want to see this song put over that one video of the Jewish party where they’re all doing that circle dance

She needs someone to hold her close and knows how to take control when sh's vulnerable. Training season's over, she's asserting her boundaries.

Beauty, elegance and talent all in one
I was hoping "training season's over" would refer to Dua herself who is now ready for a serious relationship or whatever. But no... It's another one of these tired old song lyrics that demand of men to be better men, while offering nothing in return. Otherwise great song though.

Thank you United States government for your process. After training Assyria for prison some chose to fight the trainers. Unexpected. So we heard Assyria here. Um..why? Lol-  The supermodel planet ocean and mountain camp

Still here too block my comments all you want I'll fight until i No longer can no politics involved period I just wanna save children and Vance is at the top of my list family that cares get in everyone's ears more those children are still in there its all of our jobs to pull them out 🦭🕊👩‍🏫
Training Season
Dua Lipa you have same "face expression" on the end of this video as "one married gay" (2 marriages when last time I got information) I will never forget ! (precisely lip grimace) I am really not happy for you (seeing that) ! Too much alcohol, too much "gays" around you or some people connection with person I knew very well ! And I don't like it. It means devil found the way to be near to your heart ? And "devil" is so jealous !  I can and I could help you. Question is, are you ready to be helped or not? Are you ready to escape "from hell" or not ?  It's your decission. Not mine.
Why are all the men in the video losers and weirdos and creeps and thugs?

Cadê as lengenda paixão? Te amo! Obrigado por você existir. <3
Who's here July 2024?
И наравно ова музика за песму би прошла кроз "сецкалицу". Као и видео у потпуности. Цео живот скидам људима маске (рачунајући шминку) како бих их видео у "правом светлу". Дуа Липа би прошла поред сецкалице (нисам канибал). Али без шминке. Свакако.
Yaassss ❤❤

Nosé pero mucho critican a dua lipa pero si es meter el pellejo por dua lipa lo hago xq lo que la gente sabe es criticar y no valorar es esfuerzo que cuesta hacer una buen sensillo solo para que te lo critiquen, pues para el que habla mal de dua lipa debería tomarse un tiempo y verse que es si mismo nadie llegará a sus niveles si es de haré que van hacer pues sus verdaderos fans daría. Lo que sea por poner en su lugar a esa gente venenosa no valora el trabajo que si cuenta solo tienen la vida fácil será xq no les costó es una advertencia el que se critica a dua lipa crítica sus fans, y porfavor antes de criticarla a ella mirece usted primero👍👍💯
Slutacious is my first impression; also my last.
Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair, is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there And baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice But if you really wanna go there You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands? I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team? Or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul (if that ain't you, then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload 'cause training season's over 'Cause training season's over (training season's over)
This song is blessing to my brother who was going thru lows in life but always knew where his love of his heart was inbhis now Beautiful wife as she knew by faith it will be a new beginning praise the lord  Amen❤🙏
Gonna be honest, kinda disappointed that there isn’t a dance piece that the guys broke out into for the chorus.  The song has such a great beat and an awesome build up from the bridge into the chorus that would have been amazing with some choreography!
Very old 😂
❤❤❤❤
wao ...dua is so talented...she is mothering
❤😍😍 I love Dua Lipa❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🙌🙌🙌
Dua Lipa songs? ...  I can´t stop listening😍😍😍😍😍

This song is flat
Not forgetting reading and studying back to back to back to back every given subject youtubbbbbbeeeee
Oh wait I got my first job at 11 worked hard ever since work ethic loyalty morals always prevail oh and the key ingredient love 💖
Training season has lasted 30 years it’s well and truly over donur homework first top dollar 💵
Sounds a lot like Knight Rider Theme song
I love how she doesn't sound like everyone else... she's unique and that's something we need in pop music these days.
Maravilloso trabajo 🌷🇨🇱🌷
Я хочу себе девушку такую как Дуа Липа ну или хотя бы похожую на нее. Есть такие🙏
This song sounds like Baby - Clean Bandit
This is her worst single
They play this song at my strip club itsso fire
horrendous song, annoys the crap out of me
I love her originality.The only singer without remakes and samples.She is also very talented in music,that's what this music scene needs
Got more views than subs☠️

Toylor could never!!!!!
She's like an angel

Red is definitely your hair color it's perfect

Trash and flies
Let be honest, Dua lipa never released a bad song ❤

I am curious who do u dedicate this to Dua Lipa?[Please dont tell me to the dreamers i am done dreaming with your music]

The rhythm in this song is so good
door wat jij met mij nu doe redt je dus de music en de wereld schijnbaar
I'm turning that restaurant into the elevator scene from Winter Soldier if I saw dua lipa there
Another awesome Dua Lipa song.
Das Lied ist Cool, aber das Video dazu ist Scheisse
Thumbs up if you’re listening in 2024!
song is very good. beside that anyone noticed there are too many black people???
Circles (smaller, bogger) centered , whole, triangles up / down, vortex  energies spin the block ;) I guess somebody in that position could take control and channel from the center of the circle connected to all that is / can be right ??? Wink wink ;)
What a vortex energy, inception ending there... no more mailbox space for all eho attracted get a message but only in red (root chakra) survival energies???? 😂😂😂 ✌️ ❤
Another timeless obsession track in my playlist ! Thanks Dua
‏‪0:58‬‏  🥹❤🫶🏻🙂‍↔️
Dua Lipa like have one million boyfriends
Good song.
Do yous trust me yet trust is all we have together
When u r the one girl in the world 😂
i'm so disappointed she was having a huge success with future nostalgia and now the gays decided to let her flop for no reasons
try Magical 🦄🔮🎶Blair Woods  "You Could Be The One" @blairwoods
Same like I'm the girl

Esta pessoa, @anagalvaoperez, não tem habilitações para ensinar espanhol, nem conhece os princípios básicos: o seseo, ceceo e voceo. Se ela fala tipo "sopinha de massa", é porque não aprendeu nada no tempo que viveu em Espanha e estudou em escolas espanholas... se quer ensinar, não ensine mal... e os trocadilhos maus não ajudam...

Hallo die neue CD von dua lipa ist einfach super du bist süß und sexy hübsch lustig und wunderschön liebe dua lipa ich mag dich du bist eine Traum Frau du bist süß ❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉😅😅😅😅😊😊😊😊😊😊😊Du hast schöne Augen
SHE SOUNDS THE SAME IN ALL OF HER SONGS
Boring slow motion video.
Dua Lipa or Taylor Swift?
❤
Don’t forget, June 29 is the deadline for the campaign! Gotta make the most of these awesome 4RA promos 🏆🎉
Not bad
i imagine this to be a daily struggle for Dua
E lascia entrare ascanio, l'8 di gennaiooo
IT’S GIVING MODERN DAY ARIEL/SIREN ❤🥴😮‍💨🫠Red hair and starfish✍🏽🫶🏽💃🏽🤸🏽‍♀️🥳
Какое огромное самомнение😂 Все мужики мира скачут вокруг неё,  как обезьяны.  А она - единственная женщина на земле, гордая и неприступная. Кто придумывает такие дебильные клипы?😂
❤❤❤❤
I love you❤❤❤❤fly weth me.

Makes me wonder if she ever had lesbian sessions🙈
Essa música e o clip é perfeito. Deveria ter mais de 100 milhões  a muito tempo.
Play fair! Is that a compass in your nature?🕺🏻😵
Its a great artist. 👏😍👍
Happy Holidays 2024

Brilliant song l
Can we talk about her acting ???? The gestures...
Goddess ❤❤❤❤
Audrey Peireira 77 est s'est cheveux rouge longs 😅
Her new songs are off, no melodies 😢
🤮🤮🤮
I like the beauty of Hollywood how dua lipa describes her relationships as simple "training season" however, Hollywood never had training things and seasons because creativity, beauty of pure nature, experimentations, heart breaks, and overall connection, community, and emotions waving out as waves poring life into the whole industry and the world cannot be moulded through "training seasons" ❤
Огонь!
🥵🥵🥵🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Realized this video made me feel old. All the men in this video look really oddly dressed, but I am guessing it's the fashion trend of today.
Клава Кока "нет проблем" украла и музыку, и идею клипа у Dua.
Should’ve ended with bukkake.
Anyone in june 2024?
Terbaik 👏👏👍👍
Alguien más vio al chico rubio que estaba sentado en el segundo 17 (0:17) ❤😍😘
Be honest. U came here bc of ur girl classmate’s?
Upeaa musiikkia
Old saying but I don't know if I'm over the fame. The ladder is high.
Me and you Dua!
Cool Mv 😮 We love you Dua🤍
Are you, someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I’m drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night. Play fair, is that a compass in your nature?

Класна музика
Sounds like she stole Zerbs sound for this track.
Am I the only one who actually likes this music video? Pairing this upbeat song with such a simplistic video like this fits really well because it's not overstimulating.

(Either way ur just an option to him...)
She's absolutely gorgeous 🌹🌹🌹🌹❤️😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰
According to Woke Agenda.....  Isn't this anti-feminist song against women rights and lgbtq+ community??? Is she a bigot ? How youtube community allows this? How the record company producer is not in jail yet ?
Anyone else wanna see the 1x speed of them going round the table 😂 i do lol bet its hilarious

Urrrrrrg! I’m addicted to this song! So freaking good. I genuinely dance walk when this song pops on my headphones when I’m out and about haha.  I expected the video to be in a gym setting kinda thing and dancing kinda aspect and the guys just trying to flirt with her… would have been cool too!

gurl you are flopping stop
Dua doesn't have a bad song.
Creo que la cantante me ha descubierto, si es verdad la cancion quiero encontrarte se la compuse a un amigo que aprecio como un hijo de echo la composicion esta echa para que la interprete mi querido alumno con el que tenia unos performance en esto de las musicas clasicas populares  es que siento una nostalgia incurable porque no tengo a mis hijos cerca , me encanta esta version de mi obra y bueno pase tiempo de oficinista mordisquie todos los libros que pude para desarrollar los artes me basaba en escenas de los Simpsons y asi me entrene
Unos de los mejores temas de Dua. Especialmente en el min 2:41 🤩
Я тут. Чтобы сравнить клипы с клавой кокой

How about another look ? 💭 I think I pass on this girl @DuaLipa tell Rina I said hi 👋
This is so underrated
.
❤❤❤❤
This is April 2025 & this DUA LIPA song is exceedingly emotional, exceptionally electrifying, enormously exciting, exquisitely expressive and exclusively enjoyable. The singing is singularly sentimental, spellbinding, superb, sincere and simply spectacular. ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Позорище!
Wow❤!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Výborne apesnicka❤
essa música merece muito mais reconhecimento, é uma obra-prima! <3
So many hits from one person.  Definitely the star of the ‘20s
What a beat and no dance
It should have been in a club. I've got the best dance to this song.
Video clip doesn't do the justice to the beats.
Is this shot in a prison?

i love dua lipas music and i love that she supports palitine
Вот не понимаю я комментариев насчет плагиата, в 21 веке нет контента, который бы не повторялся, все когда-либо было уже создано, все циклично, да даже если она взяла от нее что-то- какая разница? у нас российский сегмент, российская певица, которая создает для российской аудитории свои шикарные треки, которые заходят фанатам
In Russia, girls are much more beautiful.)
<3
Du bist eine richtig coole Sängerin und deine Lieder sind so gut das Lied finde ich richtig cool
Нет проблем)))
Every song of her is something special. She has a sense for music, this lady❤

Ah, Dua , you are not only a singer , but you are a inspiration for the young , pop music lovers , and you are also saving the pop music , and it is why I am your fan .. Love u Dua lipa
Молодежь нынче слушает всякое говно. Не, мы тоже слушали говно, но наше было как-то задорнее. А это еще и унылое.

1:00 Tokyo night and Training season music just similar 😅😂
❤🎧
Супер песня,супер Дуа. Хочу поделиться,что в России одна певица не очень заурядная  Клава Кока и ее продюсеры, полностью скопировали эту  песню,и клип Дуы. Так нагло и беспринципно. Я бы на месте Дуы подняла вопрос в прессе и потребовала денежную компенсацию за плагиат. Дуа лучшая 🎉❤
Me encanta 💚💚✨
❤
Dua reminds me Keira Knightley
I loved this at brits
SKEEEEEEEEYEEEEEE
Ce clip est très bien réussi. Pas de vulgarité physique qui lui va mieux.  Il devrait en avoir plus des clips comme ça.
Страшная толпа мужиков бомжей, из какой помойки, это ж надо так себя не уважать.

That video was a fever dream and I’m here for it
Hi Dua Lipa. I am Lance Smith. Tell you what, I am like your biggest fan. Over night you didn't just come out with a million hits, you came out with a million really really good hits. And it is so much fun to dance. I want you to teach me how to dance to count someday. ... If you ever see a Elton John again, if he tells you he is straight, then be nice to him. If he tells you he's gay, then tell him to leave you alone. If he doesn't leave you alone, then beat the living hell out of him. ..... Dua Lipa, nobody hits high pitch vocals like do. Not even close. How do you do that? It is so amazing. Those high pitches you hit feel so good on my ears. I can't wait for you to explain to me how you get your voice to do that. You are the only one who does that. Um, seriously, how do you do that? !!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This amazing songs and big fans ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🎉🎉
Dua parceke dieux à volu que les gens choisi leur destin snapchat
I love you so much dua

Training season really over?
Queen of poop 💯💯💯💯💯💯
The dangers of wanting to have a beautiful woman! Most of us men drool so to speak over beautiful women but let's be real! They are not for us because we do not fit into their list of suitors of their liking. Dua Lipa's music video makes me think like this, I'm right, let's keep our feet on the ground men of the world! Beautiful women always end up belonging to other men, in my opinion and many other men! These beautiful women really don't deserve them because we know how they always end up.💔Another song that I like from Dua Lipa's new work. ✍Note: As the title of the famous movie of the Goddess of beauty M.M  says 💋" Gentlemen always prefer blondes. " 💚👱‍♀💚 😇
OMG DUA LIPA THIS NEW RÉALISE IS FANTASTIC I LISEN TO IT LIKE EVERY FAY😮😊
she forgot to tell me to be in the video, i was supposed to be the one she falls in love with a gets married to

Cool Song!!! 😎🇺🇸🌆✈🌠

A CALLBACK to EARLY 2000's EURO MUSIC VIDEOS! Love the muted colors complimenting her MAROON COLORED HAIR!
I don’t think people understand how lucky we are to live in a time where this girl is making music for us
いい歌です聞いてます
The last musical part tho❤
The subtitles are auto generated and horrible - it’s crazy to me that huge teams are still leaving subtitles up to AI.

Dua lipa's music is sooo good.  It's just that this video is very uncomfortable and scary being looked at by all men.
why i got dizzy in ending
Male gaze is scary
Kevin Parker.
my oldie people I dropped them off from this baby earth to let my baby party with Dua Lipa and Gangs while I keep talking to my oldies at distance far about Light Years away from Blueto, home of General Popeye Ebeye. Yeah, this is how good is this song.
So beautiful ❤

N puedo sacarme esta cancion de la cabeza
One of the my favorite song
What a discrace of a video. Nothing on comments about the hidden message in this. This makes me sick.

Dua Lipa>every pop music❤
What a joke save pop. Will not save a paycheck soon.
Oh man....this is really scary. Imagine having that kind of attention constantly...this looks like what Dua Lipa has to navigate.
Херня звучит.
Love this song but the video is awful. How do you give everything in Houdini and then sit and drink tea for 3 mins

Porqué Dua Lipa no es más famosa que la insípida de Taylor Swift?

DUA MAKE ME A BABY!!! jiji
Meu Deus o hit do Radical Optimism
QUE VIDEOCLIPE FORTE E MARAVILHOSO MULHER
So many dudes.....Is Dua Lipa a pimp on the low? LOL She gotta "Harem of Men", like my boy Paul told somebody in college.
✨
Inner beauty
Dua is more humble
Also let me have in my memory the knowledge to fix a Nintendo Switch and use Retie technology
My Nelly stepbrother has a crush on Dua Lipa

Http 2029
Es hermosa esa mujer ❤❤❤ Que buen beat y ritmo musical
Ready to compete in the ho-lympcs
I enjoy the young lady's singing. The driving beat will be hard on the ol' head, but it's pretty fun.
Dua Lipa is a supporter of genocide and apartheid. And this is just incredibly mediocre, over produced, autotune filled garbage.
What a time to be alive when a woman asking men to be worth her time is a fun popular song that can help move the bar.
27 M only !!! Unbelievable....
is this the album that was supposed to "revolutionize pop music" said TEXTUALLY by someone on his team whoever tf it was?? cause this is LITERALLY the most generic a** pop sh*t I've ever heard in my life, not even bad, just radically GENERIC, medicore, vacuous 🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂ all of these singles are literally the absolute polar OPPOSITE of radical or revolutionary, absolutely f*cking ridiculous marketing they've got going on, if I'd listened to it blindly I just would've kinda shrugged but because of it I just actively dislike it
Let me check the Billboard hot 100, and see if Dua Lipa has dominated the charts with all her songs debuting on the chart. Just Checked: It seems Taylor has nearly all her songs on the list plural to the 20th power, charting 1,2,3,4,5, etc, Taylor can only beat herself.  And I love Dua Lipa also. Both are great in their own unique ways.
Soy tu Papi niña ❤
I love this song and the lyrics 🤞🏻💆🏻‍♀️
Love it
She neva fail at all fr
If you see an extra million views…it was me 🔂
Dua
nunca vi tanto gado na vida kkkkkkkkk
Dua lipa Queen of the World
Adore this and Dua ❤
leo is leo ✨
the perfect single! that chorus just feels so good.
for Me The Best Music from Dua Lipa Forever 🎧🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊❤️
❤❤❤
One of the best and most successful pop female artist of this decade, Dua Lipa carries the pop music of this era with great masterpiece jams of number one hits.
Great song, great lyrics but why so much vocal post production, she sounds like a robot, or is everyone just getting used to that sound now?
Dua , kur do ta kendosh nje kenge me titull shqip « TE DUA  edhe pse teksti ne English. Do te ishte e veçante 😂❤
Thx Dua Lipa for this very good Music Video Hi from Germany 🎧🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊🔊❤️

Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair, is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there And baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice But if you really wanna go there You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands?

I love the transition of the beat and this song is the best
Look at them VIEWS 😂🎉🎉🎉🎉
❤🎉
this video is sooooooooooooo ugly and weid but the song is very pretty and make funs
8/10 Danceable, romantic, solid.  Favorite tracks: (8-10) these walls, watcha doing, illusion, Maria.   Decent tracks: (6-7.5)houdini, EOAE, training season, falling forever, happy for you.   Worse track. Anything for you(actually this song is fantastic it's just disgustingly too short)
Dua literally knows whats up
🇦🇱😍
You can sing girl! Started off sounding good&continued. Your videos be nice! 🖤
This song is way too catchy, i'm so excited😊
Dua Lupita salvadora del pop 🫶🏻❤️‍🔥

Currently n Phenomenally Dua is the best female artist out there, she is the whole package , but I like Tommy Genesis as well so underated, well done female music n their dominance 👐👐👍

Que vuelva la Dua Lipa glamorosa, esta dua lipa no me gusta. Ustedes que opinan? Creo que le dieron una imagen que no la favorece, y las producciones son de menor calidad.
this song makes me want to go to the gym
Próxima cancion??🫣🤩😢❤😊
being single in your 30s
Greating music HIT`S

Awesome Dua Lipa....So Hot & Sweet
Taylor ain't close to Dua
All I hear in this song is "If a guy loves he will do stuff that could cause him to catch charges if I wanted"  Young men listening to this song, most def wait for her to tell you go, because your cell mate wont wait for you to say go.
Dua lipa again with the win of pop music 🎉
Dua Lipa > Taylor Swift  Sabrina Carpenter > Taylor Swift  Miley Cyrus < Taylor Swift No hate Swifties! 😧
Training Season > Houdini
I love you ++Dua, I want to get into Throuple with you 🌹❣️

I like the song, but... the bassline--that the whole song is based around--was entirely copied from Roxy Music's "Love Is The Drug". Does anyone else hear it?
❤❤❤❤❤
This should have been a Number 1 Hit. 😢
It's Great and Amazing and I like that

How in 2024❤
Dua > Taylor Taylor is a white girl... A replacement for the American pop world... Many stars are dying and retiring...the problem with the the stars that are not white is, the European racisst culture just listen his own guys and girls... They are not looking who is talented or not... Just racism

Dua getting stronger each time sh releases new songs😊❤
❤❤❤❤❤
The blurred scene at the end was so impactful and truly epic. A female just trying to do her own thing, surrounded by guys objectifying her or pitting against one another for someone who’s not even focused on that in this season.
the whimpering men lmao
Every time I listen this song it gives me energy and many ideas come to my head... Does anyone else feel something like that?

Sounds a lot like 'Hits different' from Astrid from three years ago.
Anyone else hear similarities in between this and "cake by the ocean" at least the first minute of it, just me?

Oui
Dua is an undeafated femme fatale damn

Are you on my team or stuck in the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go ❤
Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair, is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there And baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice  But if you really wanna go there You should know I  I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo  Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (training season's over)  I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right  I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands?

I am a f**king idiot.  No conversation!
We need Dua and Netta to collab
I need a beer and a blunt a girl friend and an uffck/ I need to hear your opinions and facts / tell me exactly what you want me to do then watch me react/ would you be happy/ after I consider your words and do what you said exactly/ I need a beer and a blunt a girlfriend and an uffck/ I need to hear you opinions and facts/ I don’t want to subtract I just want to multiply and relax/
Great video and really based op reality, I mean it!

The chorus is good Dua Lipa, the rest is just pure junk.
She really pulled a Monica 😂 Bellucci but still
I love it ❤🎉
Dua lupa is a fraud,,below average at best...daddy bought millions of her  records to boost sales...there's so many better singers..who made it..with less breaks...dina carrol..would embarass her,Lisa stansfeild. Larfs at her...teen marie, Mariah carey,, she would.nt come any where near the top..2000..in the 90s..she's manufactured.. an industry plant...she.s yop of a well below average lot..she needs to learn the art.. she.s not premiership..she.s midway league4..that's being generous.
excited for this era
Certified 🗣️BOP🔥🔥 I really like her

Loveee
Was that Taylor Swift at the end saying the voicemail box was full?
❤
She just comes with hit after hit 🔥🥰

Buena canción!
Dua lost a huge opportunity with this video/song. It had it all to be a smash hit.
Классная песня. Мне она очень нравиться.
This song is the best song released this era and I will die on this hill. Dua fans seem to think this is the weakest of the era so far but it’s better than Illusion and CERTAINLY BETTER than Houdini!
why is this so good i listen to it every day
❤❤
Um hit super dançante e ela Parada e sentada Durante o clipe inteiro 😢
Dua Lipa Song always make me dance. ❤
❤❤❤
😍
I'm a metalhead, but I always love everything what Dua does. We, from the part of Europe that has always been slapped by history, somehow we have a special taste in common.These are special emotions😉
This time red hair, I get it
We love this song with children❤️
I'm 68 and I've been a music fan since the Beatles first appeared on Ed Sullivan in 1964. I've been Dua's fan since her first Graham Norton appearance in 2019?. People I'm telling you, if you never settle for just one genre of music, from any specific era, you'll never feel old. Great music is made every year and you have to just stay open to it. Dua is incredible and I'm so glad that I'm not missing out on her talent because of my age. Age bias is a terrible thing to give in to, don't let it happen to you.

I love this music, but is missing emotion!! On the chorus she could be standing up and dancing hahaha

Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair, is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there And baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice But if you really wanna go there You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands? I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team? Or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul (if that ain't you, then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload 'cause training season's over 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) Training season's over
Mosh Pit caught in a mosh
If you play this song backwards it’s classical music! Revolutionary!!!
Salvando o pop com um clipe simples, QUEEN
Synth audio and Electronic voice augmentation anyone can do this with the right connections and know-how. How many would be able to make it without it ?  Very few I think.
I love
Houdini and TRAINING SEASONS... don't make me feel my oats.... this songs are so.... DUA LIPA AT ALL!!

"hey lascia entrare Ascanio dall'8 di gennaio perciò limarla tosta esce ma non mi rosica"
I need Dua Lipa + Shanis Twain and Paula Fernandes
Waw she is coming like a wracking ball again with amazing songs
😊
Here is dua with her flat chest making all these men roll in the sand
Anyone in 2024
Ariana grande and dua lipa are carrying pop genre. Two amazing music artists. No other female music artist can beat them
FINALLY getting out of that annoying disco music phase with the same annoying back track 🎉
I think she came to my neighborhood to cast for her video!  (I live in Tukwila, WA  (USA) BTW)
<3 greetings from POLAND!
Finish next seasson. Choose gifts, it's All Your.

G.o.a.t.😅
I love that she credits so many of the people that worked on the video. Dua is far beyond being beholden to anyone at this point and could get away with treating people like trash, the way many famous or rich people do. Nope.
75 year old give today's music a listen to...... I'll mention if I'm impressed.
20M Dua deserves more. This is such a hit ❤
20M views❤
ANOTHER HIT !!!!!!!
oh that I were a glove upon that hand that I might touch that cheek. my gay ass can’t cope.
You know she's always gonna bring it with the vocals.  That heat, though.  I gotta get up and dance as soon as I hear it.
Beautiful woman.i like her videoclip.
❤
❤❤❤❤ this beat and she is smoking hot
Absolutely one of her best songs! ❤
Dua is getting better and better ❤
so so good. Dua is amazinggg
Dua Lipa and Ariana Grande are saving the pop scene. (I'm anxiously waiting for Gaga next move).
Why this song is so addictive?

Crazy video. She touches on the disaster of immigration to the United Kingdom. 🇬🇧
She is the best, great voice. Never boring always very cool music. Love her.

Dua lipa Joshua & Bieber 18 years old how do you seen boys girls - Training Season ( Official Music Video) next year be back January 31 Friday 2025 ❤
“Hey lascia entrare Ascanio, dall’8 di gennaio…”
Here before chicken
With the speed of the instrumental i was hoping the music video to be more dramatic when it came to dancing, it has the potential for it.  I understand the purpose of this music video though...the set up is true
Who be directing her videos tho? They dont miss !!
Dua lipa > Taylor swift
The ending of this literally virtually a carbon copy of the Houdini video. What happened to her!?!? 😂😂😂
I feel that this deserved a music video like Physical, maybe a choreography, or a little dance, idk
Good song ,I am listening în the night 🎉❤
I love this song can’t stop listening to it dua is too good to be true
So amazing! ❤️‍🔥
te amo dua i love youuu
I love how she doesn't stray from mainstream pop music and yet her songs feel so original
Por qué  todos parecen modelos de perfume ?
Training Season ain't over!
migue😍😍
Казахские биты!
Poor white Girl. Waiting for ban.
At least here Dua does not try to dance.
Buena canción para el año de el 2030❤
Very nice
Por los 20M de views!!! ❤ Vamos loves. Dua lo merece❤🎉
love from bangladesh
When that second chorus hits and the extra layers of vocal harmonies come in and they way they're layered with those tasty guitars oooo man! The mix on this song is really great. Can't wait for this new album.
Someone laced the production with coco...it's so good😩
Amazing
Ооо😮. У меня такая же, серебряная подвеска😊.
DNA change white clothes bad things removal .
All of those dudes spinning around a girl, am I the only one getting nervous for her?  Symbolically of course, she is clearly safe. This video is brilliantly triggering.
What a boring video.
Miss Grand Thailand 2024 brought me here ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
My love

Por que tiene tan poca visitas este video de Dua
I disagree with the overall message, but once again, great song.
Because of the evil of human beings, and the hidden tyranny of darkness, the rain will always cry with deep and constricting tears over the lost hearts of men and women!!! The moon will always recite a poem illuminating the night!!! Carmélia Cassiopeia is not a Greek mythological goddess; but a beauty of contemporary literature!!! The creator will judge the usurped throne of the stars!!! JJJSSS  Por causa da maldade dos seres humanos, e a tirania escamoteada da escuridão,  a chuva sempre vai chorar com lágrimas profundas e constritas o coração perdido do homem e da  mulher!!!  A lua sempre vai declamar um poema iluminando a noite!!! Carmélia cassiopéia não é uma deusa mitológica grega; mas uma beldade da literatura  contemporânea!!! O criador vai julgar o trono usurpado das estrelas!!! A cause du mal des êtres humains et de la tyrannie cachée des ténèbres, la pluie pleurera toujours avec des larmes profondes et constrictives sur les cœurs perdus des hommes et des femmes !!! La lune récitera toujours un poème illuminant la nuit !!! Carmélia Cassiopeia n'est pas une déesse mythologique grecque ; mais une beauté de la littérature contemporaine !!! Le créateur jugera le trône usurpé des étoiles !!! jjjsss  ¡¡¡Por la maldad del ser humano, y la tiranía oculta de las tinieblas, la lluvia siempre llorará con lágrimas profundas y constrictoras sobre los corazones perdidos de hombres y mujeres!!! La luna siempre recitará un poema iluminando la noche!!! Carmelia Cassiopeia no es una diosa mitológica griega; pero una belleza de la literatura contemporánea!!! ¡¡¡El creador juzgará el trono usurpado de las estrellas!!! A causa della malvagità degli esseri umani e della tirannia nascosta dell'oscurità, la pioggia piangerà sempre con lacrime profonde e costrittive sui cuori perduti di uomini e donne!!! La luna reciterà sempre una poesia illuminando la notte!!! Carmelia Cassiopea non è una dea mitologica greca; ma una bellezza della letteratura contemporanea!!! Il creatore giudicherà il trono usurpato delle stelle!!! Wegen der Bösartigkeit der Menschen und der verborgenen Tyrannei der Dunkelheit wird der Regen immer mit tiefen und erdrückenden Tränen über die verlorenen Herzen von Männern und Frauen weinen!!! Der Mond wird immer ein Gedicht rezitieren, das die Nacht erhellt!!! Carmélia Cassiopeia ist keine griechische mythologische Göttin; aber eine Schönheit der zeitgenössischen Literatur!!! Der Schöpfer wird über den usurpierten Thron der Sterne richten!!!  因为人类的邪恶，因为黑暗的隐秘暴虐，雨总会为失落的男男女女的心灵流下深沉而压抑的泪水！ 月亮总会吟诵一首照亮黑夜的诗！！！ 卡梅莉亚·卡西奥佩娅并不是希腊神话中的女神；她是希腊神话中的女神。 但当代文学之美！ 造物主将审判篡夺的星辰王座！！！ JJJSSS
I  have a girl crush and it's a Dua !!!

They all looking at her through the window is too funny!
That's the ugliest laziest music video ever. Makes Dua looks so ordinary. Sigh* The song is great though.
Que nerviosa me hace sentir la idea de estar tan rodeada de hombres.. video difícil de filmar
וואוווווווו אדירההההה
At 1:05 minutes you can clearly see Mr Beast scratching his hands 😮😅
The whole lyrics hit me hard, love you Dua for this beautiful song ❤
The autumn equinox painting, the yellow waltz preamble of the season trees, is an emotional psychological theatrical scenario of the composition of the colors displayed on the heavenly wall; the sincere gray is amalgam  with the light of afterglow, in the shades of all the perpetives of the firmament !!!  The vision of the mermaid took place on the blue stone of the sea, and under the great mouth of the moon, which sang in the tuning fork of the watery world of whales and dolphins; capturing the senses of sailors and fishermen; and waking up the deep sleep of the rocks in the infinity of oceanic thoughts!!!  A  pintura do equinócio outonal, o preâmbulo da valsa amarela das árvores da estação,  é um cenário teatral psicológico emocional da composição das cores exibidas na parede celestial;  o cinzento sincero se amálgama com a luz do arrebol, nos tons de todas as perpectivas do firmamento!!! A visão da sereia aconteceu sobre a pedra azul do mar, e sob a grande boca da lua, que cantava no diapasão do mundo aquático das baleias e golfinhos; capturando os sentidos dos marinheiros e pescadores; e acordando o sono profundo dos rochedos no infinito dos pensamentos oceanicos!!!  La peinture de l'équinoxe d'automne, préambule de la valse jaune des arbres de saison, est un scénario théâtral psychologique émotionnel de la composition des couleurs affichées sur le mur céleste ; le gris sincère s'amalgame avec la lumière de la rémanence, dans les nuances de tous les perpétifs du firmament !!! La vision de la sirène a eu lieu sur la pierre bleue de la mer, et sous la grande bouche de la lune, qui chantait dans le diapason du monde aquatique des baleines et des dauphins ; capturer les sens des marins et des pêcheurs ; et réveiller le sommeil profond des roches dans l'infinité des pensées océaniques !!! La pintura del equinoccio de otoño, el vals amarillo preámbulo de los árboles de temporada, es un escenario teatral psicológico emocional de la composición de los colores que se muestran en la pared celestial; ¡¡¡El gris sincero es amalgama con la luz del resplandor, en las sombras de todas las perpetivas del firmamento !!! La visión de la sirena tuvo lugar sobre la piedra azul del mar, y bajo la gran boca de la luna, que cantaba en el diapasón del mundo acuático de las ballenas y los delfines; capturando los sentidos de marineros y pescadores; y despertando  el sueño profundo de las rocas en la infinidad de pensamientos oceánicos!!! Il dipinto dell'equinozio d'autunno, il preambolo del valzer giallo degli alberi della stagione, è uno scenario teatrale psicologico emotivo della composizione dei colori esposti sulla parete celeste; il grigio sincero si amalgama con la luce degli ultimi bagliori, nelle sfumature di tutti i perpetui del firmamento!!! La visione della sirena ebbe luogo sulla pietra azzurra del mare, e sotto la grande bocca della luna, che cantava nel diapason del mondo acquatico delle balene e dei delfini; catturare i sensi di marinai e pescatori; e svegliarsi  il sonno profondo degli scogli nell'infinito dei pensieri oceanici!!! Das Herbst-Tagundnachtgleiche-Gemälde, die gelbe Walzer-Einleitung der Jahreszeitenbäume, ist ein emotional-psychologisches Theaterszenario der Komposition der Farben, die an der himmlischen Wand angezeigt werden; Das aufrichtige Grau verschmilzt mit dem Licht des Nachglühens, in den Schattierungen aller Perpetiven des Firmaments !!! Die Vision der Meerjungfrau fand auf dem blauen Stein des Meeres und unter dem großen Mund des Mondes statt, der in der Stimmgabel der Wasserwelt der Wale und Delfine sang; Entführung der Sinne von Seeleuten und Fischern;; Den tiefen Schlaf der Felsen erwachen lassen, in der Unendlichkeit ozeanischer Gedanken; am unendlichen Grund der Ozeane!!! JJJSSS

Oi, meu Amor! Saudades! ♥️  Gostaria que você prestasse atenção à explicação e aos argumentos que se seguem. Sem dúvidas te ajudará a sanar (curar) os questionamentos e aflições de “Training Season” e recorrentes em várias outras músicas suas.  Comparo o eu-lírico de “Training Season” com o eu-lírico de 2 músicas: “Algum Dia”, do Capital Inicial e “Poison Heart”, do Ramones.   Tentarei inicialmente explicar um trecho de “Algum Dia” e depois darei uma explicação lógica e simples que serve para as 3 músicas.    1)Algum Dia: “Ninguém nunca te disse Como ser tão imperfeito Você tem tão pouca chance De alcançar o seu destino É fácil fazer parte De um mundo tão pequeno Onde amigos invisíveis Nunca ligam outra vez Talvez até porque Ninguém ligue pra você Se você quer Que eu feche os olhos Pra alguém que foi viver Algum dia lá fora E nesse dia Se o mundo acabar Não vou ligar Pra aquilo que eu não fiz Faz muito pouco tempo Aprendi a aceitar Quem é dono da verdade Não é dono de ninguém Só não se esqueça que atrás Do veneno das palavras Sobra só o desespero De ver tudo mudar Talvez até porque Ninguém mude por você Se você quer Que eu feche os olhos Pra alguém que foi viver Algum dia lá fora E nesse dia Se o mundo acabar Não vou ligar Pra aquilo que eu não fiz Talvez até porque Ninguém ligue pra você Se você quer Que eu feche os olhos Pra alguém que foi viver Algum dia lá fora E nesse dia Se o mundo acabar Não vou ligar Pra aquilo que eu não fiz Se você quer Que eu feche os olhos Pra alguém que foi viver Algum dia lá fora E nesse dia Se o mundo acabar Não vou ligar Pra aquilo que eu não fiz A vida lá fora Vida lá fora Vida lá fora A vida lá fora A vida lá fora Vida lá fora Vida lá fora A vida lá fora”   “Dono da Verdade” parece corresponder ao “amor” egoísta, tóxico, abusivo, cheio de artimanhas, contradições, dores, pesares e frustrações. Semelhante a quem se relaciona com alguém que possui transtorno de personalidade narcisista ou excesso de interesses próprios (avareza, cinismo, luxúria).  É o que acontece com quem busca encontrar paz, amor e felicidade na “vida lá fora”, no mundo exterior, nas ilusões, distrações e nas manipulações da natureza humana.  A música termina com a expressão “vida lá fora” sendo utilizada 8 vezes. Daí não se conclui, mas se intui ou se sugere que o eu-lírico, a pessoa em questão pode estar com pode estar ferida ou com a alma magoada. Possivelmente trata-se de um coração “partido” (“broken” heart).   Há provavelmente uma situação de rompimento. Onde a pessoa seguirá buscando plenitude nas situações externas e transitórias do mundo, sendo sequencialmente frustrada e ferida devido às distrações e ilusões externas do mundo carnal.  Ou buscará satisfação e fortalecimento na vida interior, espiritual e eterna. No amor e propósito divino. O verdadeiro amor disciplina, mas liberta.  Em ambas, há luta e conflito, mas apenas o fortalecimento interior salva e traz paz.    2)Poison Heart:  “Well, no one ever thought this one would survive Helpless child, going to walk a drum beat behind I lock you in a dream, I never let you go I never let you laugh or smile, not you  Well, I just want to walk right out of this world 'Cause everybody has a poison heart I just want to walk right out of this world 'Cause everybody has a poison heart  Making friends with a homeless torn up man He just kind of smiles, it really shakes me up There's danger on every corner, but I'm okay Walking down the street, trying to forget yesterday Well, I just want to walk right out of this world 'Cause everybody has a poison heart I just want to walk right out of this world 'Cause everybody has a poison heart  A poison heart A poison heart A poison heart Yeah  You know that life really takes its toll And a poet's gut reaction is to search his very soul So much their confusion before my eyes But nothing seems to phase me and this one still survives  I just want to walk right out of this world 'Cause everybody has a poison heart I just want to walk right out of this world 'Cause everybody has a poison heart  Well, I just want to walk right out of this world 'Cause everybody has a poison heart  A poison heart A poison heart A poison heart A poison heart A poison heart A poison heart A poison heart”  A dinâmica é a mesma. Descrédito, desesperança e uma situação de possível rompimento com o mundo externo. Ou manter-se na distraído na perdição pela falta de esperança e desilusão com a humanidade.    3)Training Season:  “Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair, is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there And baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice But if you really wanna go there You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands? I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team? Or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul (if that ain't you, then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload 'cause training season's over 'Cause training season's over (training season's over)”  . . .
It's Amazing 🎉🎉🎉

Dua Lipa is finally back! She is the best performer and singer in the world! Taylor Swift can bow at Dua Lipa's feet! I love you, Dua Lipa! You are my favourite pop singer and I'm really excited for new album! ❤
Dua needs us! Let's get more views for this masterpiece ❤
training season needs more hype
I like her a lot but I realize that she never pushes her voice when she sings. Her music is good but without emotion if i may say so.
Where are the views ? 😢 this song is underrated
Wowowo genial ❤
✨️
Sounds like Basement jazz 'rendez-vous'
Unica 👏👏👏
МОЩНО ! 💗

The part with her deep voice, remind me of 'Dua Lipa' album, those good old days!! ICONIC
I'm not her fan because she is a total stranger and she is still a bad English lady in years.
So Dua is implying a spring training? How come she changed her hair color? I've never seen her like that in the Grammys.
Du ur.  Voice I like ur voice I thinks it cute

'Cause I've been there And baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice But if you really wanna go there You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands? I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team? Or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul (if that ain't you, then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload 'cause training season's over 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) Training season's over

Inferior quality song
This is just too catchy for me right now >.< :3
All I can see is malena 💅🏻
Her voice is so strong, she is my most def favorite singer
Ютуб мало показывает просмотр.Что-бы не платит Дуа👎👎👎👎👎👎 Она очень талантливая красавица...❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
inscreve te no canal obrigada
Bella canción 💖
I hope you can find producers to try and maintain this style when you’re done working with Kevin. This album will make me a fan, but I won’t be a legit fan after Kevin’s departure if you go right back to predictable mainstream pop.   Replicating KP is impossible, but I would respect the hell out of any attempt to continue this vibe.

this is all crap

So pop
DUA..DUA..DUA...❤ your name is always easy to remember❤
This floped so hard wtf is going on
The song is a BOP!!!
the real question everyone wants to know the answer to is if she will ever stop doing bukkakes
Exactly how I feel about my profile on POF. So many messages by scumbags... Lol... No one of them makes me feel like leaving home like Dua did not even feel like standing up from the chair on that hela-bar... Lol...
How does she never have a bad song.
He was a model?
Red hair a no no
Cool song, where is the location? I was trying to see what stars were on the wall?
She's  dull
❤❤❤❤
She's fire 🔥 😍
We with missa get out going pn the sky enter start
Ya slay
HOW THE FUCK THIS HUMAN BEING CAN BE SO FUCKING GORGEOUS PLS EXPLAIN
احلى دواليبا بالعالم
Why does this lady have such catchy songs
Show
As amazing as she is... why go all Britney tongue for the lip-synced 'L' ? It's exaggerated, unrealistic and plain funny.
woah, so much diversity in one video.
HA HAA
Why did this flop so hard you guys?
is anyone noticed the guy who is looks like Eminem?
Now
¿Por qué me parece que está cansada de las canciones y de la atención a su persona? Creo que actuar o incluso hacer yoga le sienta bien.
This video Is a sort of copy ti Jennifer Lopez in Papi
fans de Dua lipa de Mexico no los veo
Has she ever released a shit track. I think not
It's gonna be hard for this era to beat Future Nostalgia because FN is pure perfection, but I'm so ready for Radical Optimism!!
Dua love you very much! 🎉❤✨️ I really love this song too! After a few days break I listen to it again and it is on repeat now.
♥️ Mi linda Dua Lipa no se queda atrás con su bacanísima música.😍
Training session but she was actually training in houdini song 😂
Am I the only person who can hear a basement jaxx sample or something similar?
Brilliant.....thought of Knight Rider!
Dua is carrying the pop genre STRONGLY
This song still needs to grow on me... I love every single song of hers though so hopefully this will grow on me!! She's amazing 🥰🤩
I wonder why is she flopping now?
I can genuinely see him becoming one of the greats in the future with a voice like that. So much power and stage presence, you go Benny 🤝🏽♥!!
Quality and meaning 💪🏻
Amo inmensamente a esta mujer ❤️
👍👍👍👍👍👍

dua lipa karabük üniversitesinde çekmiş klibi
😊
Где она   набрала такую  страшную массовку ?  Из  тюрьмы   ? Какие то бомжи , мигранты . Она единственная белая среди цветных
I have literally been ADDICTED to this song lately. Everything about Dua truly fascinates me. Love her so much
Mem l am so impressed you l like your voice like you❤
HI. I NEED A RECORD DEAL. Hot Barz (FICTION)  [Verse 1] Suffer from delirium and delivering Food, shivering under rain. Cinnamon And water make me bigger and I consider ‘em A vigor pill. Alcohol keeps killing will. Muse becomes different, friends indifferent. Weed is magnificent when I burn it for an immigrant. My blood is virulent like my kindred and A b…tch-a…ss commissioner. My general practitioner Shuns me like a prisoner. I’m the illest listener. I’m not innocent. I keep sinning and shock CNN. I’m the best MC in-in the world of screaming men. Spit about my seam and end. Victory is imminent Like semen and milky sea in-in Her deep C. Begin licking the steel gat again. Paradise is my Kattegat I get ecstatic at. Misery is my advocate. I get sadder but I wanna eat a halibut and live in a castle. Mad. Now I am ada-adamant. Ready to become extravagant.  [Chorus] Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.   [Verse 2] F…ck hazing. Guns blazing. Run amock. Crazy Like a nuclear sun daisy. My gun’s amazing. Retaliation is imminent like ej…culation. Humiliation is moral m…sturbation. I wanna become the master facing The music of celebration. Immigration To Canada is my hot dream. I ain’t gonna rot. Beam When I listen to a hip-hop theme. Screw my passport. Belong to the low class. Short On gas, watt, and grass stock. The swanky cuss. What?! I can be a crass dog. I embody an impasse. Shock The fat ones. Slog drives me nuts. Block Roads and tank farms. Mock big shots. Walk Down the Hell street. I sell beats to those who live in Well. Freaks Respect my bell. Deeds pile up like bed sheets.  I break a leg. Cheese! Smile and get upset. These Lines are dedicated to my Hell streets. [Chorus] Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.   [Verse 3] I wanna restart my brain to alleviate my pain. I try to explain what train is gonna hit my game. Slight blame grows like Sly’s fame. Neither alright nor okay. No flight. No gain. I-I-I obtain nothing but eye pain. Envy the sky plane. F…ck my hand. You fuck a b…tch. I wanna strike it rich. But I visit a rocking bridge to get rid of vassalage. Kidding you. I choose a craggy ridge To gobble a happy midge. Daddy’s fridge Was empty like a valley. Pinch My salt, dude. I’m doped up on solitude. Dream of gratitude when I disturb quietude To outrap Ice Cube on YouTube. My-my habitude is breaking a habit, dude. I wanna buy a rocket to fly to Saskatoon. However, I vow to endeavor to find some money. Freedom is damn yummy. A bum’s tummy Gets fat after a scum rally.  [Chorus] Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.   [Verse 4] Metaverse after metaverse. Aletta is a better nurse. I let ‘er curse when her coochie reddens first. Cheddar and Purse make Aletta converse With my little fella. Worth being a go-getter. The hearse Is designed for Red Balds. No more khaki skirts! Bu-bukkake wh…res will go public first. I-I threaten jerks and reverse the debtor’s course Of history. Chicks love kissing me for my hefty pearls. My Chevy isn’t worse than MG Kelly’s hearse. Frenemies disperse when I shit in Beverly firms. Drink heavily. Mors invigorates… me at bigger raves. I dance with vigor. Dates cause semen waste. Hold my liquor, Grace. I love to trigger states Of crazy mind by kicking gates… of Hell. B…tches snigger. Baits are useful for bitter fates. Envy is my dinner, babes. My brain gets bigger. Face The music. You lose it to me sweating profusely. I run the Muse league. Walk in my shoes, Meek! Your crew’s weak like a red abuse clique. When I slap a tattooed cheek, frigging news shrieks. They call me Nude Freak. I shit in Puke Creek.  [Chorus] Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.   [Verse 5] Rapping is my rumphetamine. Count cheddar. Scream When a model drops her sweater seen On Brazzers. Motherf…ckers can’t forget the queen. Order a shredder. Clean like my sweater. Dream.  When I get better, mean tossers lose investor sheen. Reviewers are under pressure. Obscene Jokes get stuck in motherf…cking throats. I cause suckers’ strokes when I bug ‘em. Blokes Age like Hulk and Knowles. Shut up, folks! Take the plunge and liberties with A rancher who keeps stealing this Show. I poison her chicory’s root. Witcheries F…ck up when I cause her miseries By setting killer bees on her liver, knees, And tilburies full of skinny kinsmen Gs. Blade: Trinity’s more tedious than my guillotines. Pay all commission fees if you wanna keep breathing. Please Don’t fart in my vicinities. Only I can sin in these Cities and seas. Sowing evil seeds is a mere piece Of cake. Break a leg if you are my enemies.  [Chorus] Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.   [Verse 6] Forget about the orphanage. Memories often-often itch When you feel-feel forgotten, b…tch. A vile, fallen-fallen witch Wanna leave a wide rotten stitch. You are a foreign glitch. Northern walkers snitch on you. The world is a big zoo. Some blaggers intrigue you. They wanna rob a flick room To grab a chic jewel. Walk in a rich shoe and outsing-sing Wu. We got the big loot. Now we are chilling in Chile Inn. Relish sinning and sipping gin. Tripping in the hippy den. Keep grinning and filming slim strippers licking Dicky. Sin Is my hobby, b…tch. I forgot about the orphanage. My doctors itch when I slap ‘em and burn a bridge. Throw a hotter binge. No more slaughter, b…tch. My enormous midge protects me from alter-itch. I’ll never get older. Rich is my show name. The whole game Must go on like Crowe’s fame. I-I obtain bags of showcaine To clean my nose. Play with my Snow Babe.    [Chorus] Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.  Hot barz. Hot barz. Listen to my hot barz. I run-run-run hip-hop-hop czars.   © Norfum 2024.
1:01 Dua should really see the comment box of the song Tokyo Nights, I really feel sorry for her . I know it is not her fault and just a coincidence 😢
What is the title of the song at the beginning of the video?
I was expecting a fitness session MV, but it's different 😂
💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋💋
😆😆😆😆
Looks like very fathers dream for his daughter . . . FJB
❤😮
it's too bad the song is a banger, cos the video is basic
Bridge and chorus stolen from somewhere else some other song 💀
If u want a example of Perfect pop music it is Dua lipa took me album or so to get it, but the more Dance her music is the more i like it, last 2 albums and her colloberations have been ace
Unfortunately coordinated filming with day release.
❤ Great song to dance to
Thanks for good music
Excellent Dua❤
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️✔️
This music video reminds me of the life we lived in the gulf as laborers, coz if gender segregation we lived in towns full of male from Asia and Africa without a single woman in that small town .
idk if it's the staging... idk if it's the lighting.... but all these british boys look basic af 😬

'Cause I've been there And baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice But if you really wanna go there You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there?

SOS hermosaaaa duaaaaa
One of the best songs as well as houdini but sadly it is not blowing up like her last album i hope she somehow saves it
Ilove it❤
i cant believe this song has only 15 million views. deserves more!
Girl your voice is amazing ❤❤❤❤
This (to me) has a similar feel to K Minogue's "Padum" ...I wonder if anyone's done a mashup, now going off to check the key :-) ...oh bollocks, this is in F and Padum is in C :'-(
DUA IS AMAZING!!!  HE DOESN'T MISS A BEAT. PURE TALENT🥰
Ici nous ne parlons que de training Season vraiment Dua Lipa si je pouvais montré les mélodies qui sont dans ton cœur bon bref tu sais même je te connais pas tu es personne inoubliable je sais que en 2008 . quand tu etait jeune tu avais une vois douce j'aimerais  chanter moi aussi malgré j'ai pas tu peux parler ça me fait du bien quand je t'écris baye 🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴 dua

So HYPNOTICC!!!
I felt like it's from the golden age of pop ❤

This song sums up dating from a woman's perspective
Pobres hombres, la belleza es una ilusión

slusam 2 muzke istovremeno ovaj klip muzik kadirov hoce da po cepa sve zvucnike   moze na 1000 muzika istovremeno da slusam    amin
Ascanio!!
Dua is definitely one of the coolest pop stars on the planet.
One of her lines are “even when I’m horrible” literally explains why she’s getting no man and needing to write a song about not finding a decent one 😂😂
Bu şey değil mi ya.. Meslek lisesi.
Esta canción es espectacular ,me encanta el vídeo le da significado, esto merece ser mas sonado yeah !
Yes👍💪
❤
If you read this comment it is because it is my heart that dictates it; each of your songs for me is a new beginning, a dawn. Thank you Dua Lipa! 🇮🇹🌹

Good doll, you can see that you were born in Serbia. A real Serbian beauty.❤❤❤
Pop music is life
Dua lipa ❤
The best song of 2024

Diva ❤
Why ifs the video full of homeless undesirables
Love it
mating season or training season?
Пипец, талантище у неё конечно!!!

Atp I think it's pretty impossible for Dua to disappoint! She's that good💯
Dua always delivers
Oh emm gee I love this song so muchh

After Training Season, I realized my workout routine was just a 'trying season'...
Te amo Dua

Queen of poop 🥢🧪
is it just me who is listening to this song over and over and over and over again?
Just looking at the blokes. Is that what passes for stylish in 2024? Okay, so I'm an old man but that was how homeless drop outs dressed in my day.
I can't identify this song as pop music. Definitely, I like this song much better than previous ones. There's something more special about her new style. ❤❤❤
Guys,you need to use the door
Cool tune. Got here courtesy of that short that that said this is another *stolen* melody from a much older song, the usual music producers stealing other's works.
It'z gotta suck knowing just bout every man in tha world wantz ya hand in marriage but ya still single,how TF is this even possible?!
😛 DUA!😛
OH my god one zeléun Fans here smash them dua the best
Meh
Excellent music 💯💯💯
You are a beautiful singer my favorite artist Dua lipa my love I'm 10 years old
Hi fans, you have to play my creative fall guys round from your training season video clip. I leave you the code: 7365-4597-0793 ❤🎮
Yes, she is Pop Music, like this music artist Duo Lipa, love listening to her music over a huge system in my home st. barths in the clubs outdoors, and i hope you all reading this will subscribe to me on my channel and listen to my “new vibe music” which is Future-Soul-Hiphop. Top life to all reading this and coming throug this great artist page.
In all honesty, you have shortened my suffering in failed relationships, and now I have had enough and am no longer searching, because most of them are children who have not grown up.
Dua Lipa used to a joke, but she has proven herself
14m views in 1 month? Wow go Dua
My name is Elian and I am 3 months old. I love Dua and her music. Can I get a shout out for my account ❤❤❤
Her voice have always power. I make this.
This is flopping harder than Houdini.
Song is good but people in video no good
Why there are so many blacks in the video
13,433 Comment:    T H I S    I S    E X C E L L E N T    ! ! !
National Service is coming in!
I wish Dua would have more scenes in different places in her music videos
Song= amazing Music video = meh
At the end of the day, I’m getting a Vegan Girlfriend, so I may need to train someone too 😊P.S …I can run 100 metre dash in 14 seconds!lol😊
she  copied the video from a  artist called Emma danelon
The song is good but what the fuck is up with the clip
Wow! ❤
podemos admitir que recreó lo que pasó en el bar de argentina ? Volvé DUAAAA
Marry me Dua Lipa 💍
❤❤❤😊😊😊
I think dua has it spot on how most females feel
This song lives rent free in my head and I'm not mad about it!!
This clip represents most women today dealing with boys who only have age without maturity 🤯 Loved it!😅
That bass track though
This music video has got an unbelivable 2000s vibe. I love everything about it.
Dua lipa's song's bassline dannng
La mejor siempre nunca la cambiaría por otra
Is true
Dua Lipa ti adoro sei troppo brava bellissima canzone 🤗🙋‍♂️
🐷💓💓💓💕💕💘💘🐰
This song and video just doesn't impress me nearly as much as Houdini did. Hope the album has some bangers
all these guys look weird
Very good yeahhhh 🎉❤

Not my kind of music as such, but this a catchy Pop tune
Go Albania !!!!!!🥂🥂🥂🥂
Who's think Dua would colab with Empire of The Sun and PNAU? Bakermat too?
Dua Lipa no decepciona y nos entrega un video tan aburrido y falto de gracia como todos sus anteriores. En este caso acompañado también por una canción aburrida, hacemos combo.
Что за толпа кукколдов вокруг тёлки по вызову? 😁 у меня на такую даже в состоянии опьянения не встанет.
My cat likes your music

Tokyo night people 👍
Un lugar a dónde ir para que nos reseteen la memoria y andar como si nada, 😂😢😅
Well that was boring
Дуа ты пушка 😎
Dua music is save us again
Bacım, peşine takılan ve seni rahatsız eden zibidilere bakma sen. Güzel şarkı söylüyorsun , böyle devam et lütfen.
The song is similar tokyo nights
queen of pop ！！！！！
omgggggiloveit
ysllllll queen
3:35 hi foot 😂
The song ❤
My new favorite song 👁👄👁 💋💋music to my ears
Love the video concept
These new songs sound so depressing in my opinion.
What a plot twist it would be if at the end of a clip there was a gal that sat down at her table
i would have the perfect GIF for dat cup of tea, from salvatore ganacci 🍵👇👈👈
when the song sounds like a BANGER but the millionaire popstar's team couldn't afford captions so miss a quarter of the lyrics 😭
Nice to see her featuring more men in her videos…just a shame this song and the previous track are not at the same level as anything from Future Nostalgia. Not bad but nothing amazing.
up and up go
Training session ❤
I love dua lipa❤
Im 56 years old and can't wait to buy the next album. Her music just sits right with me. I'm an 80's child, but damn, she has it going on. I hate Swift.
Dua lipa did so many face surgeries, she looks plastic doll
I love Dua Lipa's music more than anyone else out there. Some tunes have a 70's vibe, which I love.
on dirait doria le pic café incroyable ?
❤❤❤
Dua lipa In this new, very spectacular version 😢
Mds, essa música não sai da minha cabeça 😅 é um vício ❤

Who's making her music?! I just heard Eminem's latest song. It was sht. I'm probably his biggest fan. This Dua Lipa's song is fresh  beat good, song good, video ehh
I feel like it is a sex song.
Tokyo Nights chorus
<3
Awesome
I can’t get over her hair. Gorgeous!!
Came here for the song, stayed for one of the most aestehetic music video I have ever seen.
Epick
I claim this as my anthem! No more settling for less 💅💓
Best song ever 😊❤🎉
I love this song wow 💓 Dua Lipa♥️

Dua Lipa mi novia - Tiziana
This pop-disco of Dua Lipa is driving me crazy!!!! I absolutely love it!
Well done, Dua Lipa!!!
The video is making me anxious with all these dudes roaming aroun her and watching her like a hawk.
actually god tier
hmmm so this is a musical documentary!!! What ever will the BBC think of next when not protecting pdfiles like Jimmy Savel !! Almoat had me convinced but there's no way there's so many white folks in London!! haha *Almost* Almost
the men in this video is  portrayed like zombies never seen a girl :)
I'm so extied for the new album
None of the male in neither Dua's music clip are straight. Perhaps, she needs to spend lesser time with "them" and start her real training season with the big man 😌
❤💜
Dua Lipa VS Ariana Grande ❤ EPIC
I'm not a man or a lesbian but I'd still be running to her
am i the only person who saw eminem at starting point?
Какая красавица
This song will be number 1 in the music chart 🎉
Bi panic

I REMEMBER HEARING THIS ON THE RADIO😭
The Video is hot 🍒
Dua is the GOAT

Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair, is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there And baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice But if you really wanna go there You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands? I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there?

This video looks like all the dinghy divers that enter the UK illegally 🤢
Dua lipa the best ❤❤❤
Here after Papa Diaz's Dance 😂😂❤
Период весенней активности у бездомных псов примечателен своеобразными собачьими кучками, которые мужская их часть образовывает вокруг одной самки, чувствуя в себе желание размножаться. В народе это время животной оживленности принято называть «собачьи свадьбы».
The true princess of pop
Aus der Uni wird nciht viel heute ich gehe lieber in die bibltihek udn lerne dort etwas wenn ich schon hier bin

Ich glaube du hast mich einfach in der 11 nicht wiedererkannt   Warten wir uns in der Mittelstufe begegnet litt ich darunter dass die Lehrer mich wegen meinem trendy aussehen und Sozialisten nicht als Streberin warnst sondern als beliebte höre zum zweiten Unterricht erst nett mit mir war    Ich glaube einfach du hast mich erkannt ich war hin und wieder in der 10. Da ich dort Freunde hatte    Aber ja du warst der Grund d dass ich wieder dieses äußere annahm

Dua is so amazing
Vraiment trop top !! magnifique !❤  C'est un vrai caméléon !! Tout lui va encore bravo
I'm pretty sure that this song and the music video is a tribute to Midnight City. The concept remains the same after all.
Big fan of Dua. My daughter and I jam out to her stuff all the time. I think she was so tired after the Houdini video that she just thought... I'm just going to sit in a coffee shop for this go.😂
ای قشنگ تر از پریا تنها تو کوچه نریا بچه های محل دزدن عشقعه منو میدزدن عشق منو میدزدن 🕺🕺 قشنگ همینه 😂
Viel Erfolg beim Job  (Mir ist nicht nach Emojis ) Dass ich you’ve eingeschaltet habe reicht erstmal an selbst uberwudneug   Viel Erfolg heute
This masterpiece should be streamed more ❤❤❤❤
Elle l'est pas mal du tout Dua lipa je comprend que tout les hommes lui courent après ❤❤❤❤

Where's the 🔥 16 from Meg at?? This song has her name ALL OVER IT!!! Hopefully Dua and her team are smart this time and put someone who actually belongs on and fits on the track. We don't need another Da Baby/Levitating mistake lmao 🤣 🎉❤😮.

Great new song! Good line. :)

крутящиеся мужики уже были - плагиат
Most of the men featured in this video are butt ugly lmaoooo and what’s with all the famous people in the picture frames?! I saw Stalin  (I think) and Nietzche roflmao (I’m a history nerd). I love the song tho. Dua has made many great songs.
That's how an natural Albanian beauty looks like🥰

Habe einen erfolgreichen Arbeitstag!!!

You are a fast talker if you can sing this at 2x speed
I doubt Dua would give at this point any chances to any of the guys in the video... She's probably now into classy rich old money men 💰✨
❤💎
Elle continue à nous surprendre toujours ❕️album après album c'est toujours meilleurs  top   ( la voix ! 🎤🎵🎶)
Love her voice. ❤  True talent an singing among other singers I will not say her name hyped up that cannot sing.

The tune the 90's vibe ❤🎉 what a 💣
Lieber bleibt kochen ein Hobby weil dieses kochen Hilfe Ding ich war da noch mehr ein bunter Hund als am Campus
Dua dua duaaa..  We love you❤😂 Love her name.. Epic👍
Sie meinte ersteinmal alles froetäumen und wegwerfen
Andrej lies Kira auch ihr Glück zu finde und sein wir ehrlich Kita und Nikita waren besser als Kita und Andrey und Andrej ging zu Katja
Verarbeite das erstmal natürlich aber das ist so    Würdest du wollen dass ich neben dir noch jemanden habe   Ich wäre darüber passiv aggressiv   Und würde mich dauernd ungeliebt fühlen    Ihr beide verordnet Glück nur eben von einander getrennt
I really love this song
I love Dua Lipa, she is flawless both visually and musically! But not gonna lie, this vid would’ve been way better without all those creeps hanging around her and gawking at her through the window. It gives off creep vibes and makes me feel uneasy to watch her there amongst all that!😧
in the middle of refugee crisis? europe & turkey disliked this video.
Your voice is so infectious that you just want to fall in love with your music. You are simply an unmistakable artist in the music business🔴⚫
So Fantastic Lyrics 👍❤️👍❤️. Amazing Music 🎵🎶🎵🎶. Rocking Voice Friend 😍🥰😍🥰.
❤❤❤ Dua is such a talented artist she writes her songs and is just a damn good artist dancer and singer true talent! Love you girl
..the chorus reminds me of Digital Farm Animal (Tokyo Night)...
Fact about me I think you are the best singer
I swear she’s one of the most beautiful women in the world
Such a good song ❤
I love you Dua❤
no sé si el color de pelo no favorece a la reina dua lipa, le veo la piel mas opaca :(
A music video that breathes life into a song and paints a new realm before your eyes, akin to an enchanting journey through a world of colors and energie🦋
Video budget = 200 dollars
eu amei
SAY LIPA..............YOU CAN'T FIND ANYWHERE ELSE TO GET TEA?????????????????????........D!MN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.....SOMEWHERE WITH ATLEAST 1 OR 2 WOMEN IN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!......THIS LOOKS LIKE A NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC EPISODE...WHEN A LONE GAZELLE WONDERS OFF FROM THE PACK AND GETS SURROUNDED BY HYENAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...LOL....I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENS NEXT!!!!!!!!!!....LOL.....I WILL BRING YOU TEA FROM NOW ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!....MUCH LUV LIPA.......INTERNATIONAL SUPERSTAR....
Not the best video but its a decent song
You are the Best
Amazing❤❤❤
What does Dua Lipa actually mean by Training Season? Training Season for what exactly? For a particular sport? If so, what sport? The song title seems weird to me. Seems very vague too. I have seen the song lyrics and that's not really helpful.  I do love her music but this one I just can't pin down on what type of training season she is referring to. Does anyone know?
❣️❣️❣️🤞🏼
There we go again, Dua Lipa saving our ears
She is a true HITMAKER
Me encanta ❤
This song is AMAZING ❤
Amazing woman I love her ❤️
❤🇧🇩
Men and women both needed this message. It feels like a watershed moment. A clear cut signal for the genders to get back on track and build something new together.
ON REPEAT 🔁😎
best song ever !!!
@dualipa new looks all are amazing 😊😊😊😊❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥
This song reminds me of something else. It’s on the tip of my tongue but I can't remember the name..
The beats and music helps us forget she cannot sing. Kudos to autotune, tho!
Dua Lipa!!!
Nitip sebelum hits
She is the queen of music
Please, beauty, give us a break! We feel like a boxing bag. Congratulations! And thanks for making life a little bit easier.
New music favorite. Of You to me kkkkkk
The guy in the second verse that goes to get in close with dua just makes me melt he's so hot 😮❤
The new Queen ❤
She is starting to become a by and pass singer soon….no more gd songs
Fun fact, they aren’t actors. This is just Dua Lipas average morning
Unfortunately... so vulgar video...a horrible concept...ugly criminal faces...like those violent piranhas wondering and planing to attack a helpless beautiful creature...locked up in some Freudian nasty nightmare... Why ? You  have A great song = lyrics and music...superb performance ( check out Dua 's performance at Brits 2024 reward show...) ...a Goddes = shtojzovalle ...beautiful singer...and...and..and...the concept of video is : film the ugliest criminal faces ...film ugly criminals surrounding a helpless  beautiful young woman...attacking this beautiful young woman with with their crazy sinful eyes and animalistical desires...?!?!? Absolutely,  the director of this vido is so unprofessional...incompetent...and...he must pay back...reimbursement...what a waste ...!!!
Compositionally completely irrelevant song
this video is really good. SHOUTOUT VINCENT!
That one guy in the window..😫😅
Im sorry but i dont like it ....borred
YES 🎶TRAINING SEASON is OVER 🎶💯😎👍and Dua LipaAaaaaaaaaaaaaa with 🎶HOUDINI 🎶 and Dua Lipaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa is beautiful woman 💯😎👍
The song is catchy and an instant hit,but the video is degrading to males of all kind.Either i dont get it or she's represented as a goddess and men are fighting over her...right?
Why is she in the gentlemen's bathroom? Is that a metaphor?
Beautiful song dear Dua Lipa😍💖!  It describes perfectly how I feel right now.  I too am looking for true love, which can arise from someone who understands me entirely and releases my potential.  It's not easy.  Because in today's world, outward appearance and ostentation have exterminated romantics, myself included.  Nobody looks for mythological figures like Venus or Cupid.  But everyone wants only King Midas.  So if a Cupid is not appreciated in a materialistic and empty reality, he seeks thrills in technology and speed and becomes Hermes the messenger.  I hope to bring a smile to your face with this message.  You are wonderful and divine Dua Lipa 😍💓.  I love your songs.  Kisses ❤️😘
❤❤❤
I really enjoy her music since The one and new rules 😊, she never disappoint us. She saves us during Covid with futur nostalgia ❤
❤️🖤🤍💚
Dua always brought us to classic pop and discotic..i feel like just booster..when i walk or driving..just turn on this song..guys..the vibe so fucking crazy..u will happy and positive vibe from morning until midnight..hahaha
I like this song ❤
❤ dua from odisha india❤
Training seasons over
omggg!!!
DEFINITIVAMENTE... HERMOSA!!! ❤❤❤💖❤️😍
We need the original video concept, with explosion, car crashing, demolition and earthquake just like the original video ( otherwise I will stop to buy your latest album ) WE NEED TO RE RELEASE THE ORIGINAL VIDEO CLIP.....
Great Great song. Huge dua lipa fan
Dua Lipa with her talent , videos , showing pop music to move on this 2024!!
I don’t listen to Dua Lipa typically, but after hearing Kevin Parker was producing this record I couldn’t help but listen. What a perfect match of vocals and production with so much depth! Can’t wait to hear the rest of the record!!!!
Não tem como ficar parado e não curti esse novo single da Dua Lipa!!!!❤❤❤❤
some people: Dua will not pass from the future nostalgia for me: This girl still goes far
I LOVE THIS SONG
My favorit song ❤💛💙
Play fair
Ugh I find my new obsession
Oleeeeeee🇪🇦
To ONLY WTH HuMAN YES WTF HuMAN Okay 🎶Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo🎶💯😎👍 And Dua Lipaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa is beautiful woman 💯😎👍
Watch this masterpiece being ignored and not taken its rightful place as a legendary record.
"Spiral" "Swirl" "Galaxy" "Hurricane" "Star" "Betelgeuse"  Possible names of her new album
She´s superpretty , makes awesome music & seems awful nice too !😍
Anyone 2024
This song sounds like Nightcore  - Rockefeller street 😂
Love this !!
Training Season  Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair, is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there And baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice But if you really wanna go there You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands? I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team? Or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go You should know I I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul (if that ain't you, then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload 'cause training season's over 'Cause training season's over (training season's over)
With all the dudes looking at her through the window, she should choose the black dude. For no other reason, than the sex would be most satisfying. I bet on that! Just keeping it real! Peace.

sorry but this video is giving me 'white couch' vibes 🤢
Start here 0:13
I don't know how many times I've played this song today. I lost count.
Falling for her voice and beauty 😍😍
Dua lipa crush of my heart And a big fan
❤️🔥🔥
أنا فقط أحبك من غير أفكار بشعة وقبيحة أحبك أكثر من كل جمهورك حتى أنا أعرفك قبلهم  The room وقبلها كنتي لؤلؤة نقية الآن  أصبحتي مرهقة كثيرا من هذا المجتمع التعيس 😢❤
Dear Dua. You do Not a bounce of Men in Daylight! You need One Man that You can thrust Night and Day with Your whole Heart and That is a Seaman. Only Seamen knows what a real Home-Harbour is; The Heart and a Safe Harbour to rest in Safety for The next trip on The World’s Stormy Seas. You, Dua, are doing a lot of trips out on The World on Your Tours as well but You need a Safe Home-Harbour to rest between those Trips. And You need a Man that has a “Bigger Head” and more experience than You to keep You in Control and someone You can ask and thrust for anything whatsoever what You are wondering about without The risk to leak out in The Public and that is Little Me and I am free for The moment. I can move My “Behinding” wherever You want, Dua, because it is Your future Life and Adventures / Shows On Stages wherever in The World that is going to be in Focus anyway. I’m used to simple Life in Cold HOU HOU HOU Land, Finland, so I don’t need much. (Even if I have been Chief Electrician on Cruise and Passenger Ships with Hollywood Stars so I’m used to that World too) Food and Shelter is good. Education and Experience of The Stormy Seas and The World with all their Bars I have already and I’m not using those Facilities anymore. Don’t hesitate to contact Little Me Dua! I have a secret energy also that I can give to You. From Finland With Love ! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😎🇫🇮
The chorus to this song sounds like “Tokyo nights” by digital farm animals . I was trying so hard to remember where I heard it from . I absolutely love both tho
I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there?

Ахаха клип про алений хоровод
Ela canta aos 04 cantos do planeta e todas os planetas não terrestres, ela é foda, canta pra caramba, está amadurecida vocalmente e pessoalmente e com uma bagagem grande de experiências, só mostrando o nível da artista que é hoje, uma cantora cheias de camadas!!
Que hace eminem ' zayn ' y el hombre de megan fox en el video y también sus exs
Te amo duaaaaa, todo lo que haces son temazos

مين جاء من تيكتوك 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
Malena rules❤
Her vocals remind of PINK sometimes. I like the song.
I don't understand this vid, it seemingly featuring men of color hounding a woman... If that what's meant to be portrayed I believe there should've been more white males in the video doing the same behavior
I love you Dua lipa 🌹❤️❤️😚
this 1 is not It dua get better babe <3
It's easily in top 10 best songs ever made.
Wooow! I love it! ❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤
J'adore ❤

Dua Lipa es una Diosa del pop ❤
Am I the only one who was hoping that "the one" who had what she was looking for sat across the table from her towards the end of the video? 🤔🫣🥺🫶🏼
I love you my baby dua lipa. Why she is so cute .
It seems evident that it is not Dua's best song, it is true that "levitating" set the bar very high and since then I see a certain regression.
I like this song 🎧❤️‍🔥
YASSS 10M!!!
как же эта песня совпала с моей ситуацией в жизни!!
I'm so proud of her
Me watching the video hoping for wlw at the end 😂

This song 🎉
*_My Life feels like a RODEO… Dua Take Control <3_* 🐎 🤠 😘
I think it's a nice song from Dua. But just like The Weeknd,  she has been releasing song after song every year, and it's kinda bored
Just came here to say that I'm tired of hearing this in my ads.
oh DUA LIPA, I love you fan#1😘🤩😍🥰
Who's from 2089☝️🐰👉
Reminds me "Malena vibes"

Dua и слово пацана❣️
Video is too simple. Why?
if Emma Stone was the last person on earth I'd rather talk to a branch,hey Dua ❤ for you love that song it sounds so familiar to something but what the hey I like ❤ it
❤
Ughh your hair your height your voice your face everything is so perfect🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
Guys on background are hot too
I love youuuu girl
And give you a track.
Feels very Matrix if there's a new series I'd use this visual.
DJ Off Season Scorpion
beautiful song😍😍❤
Put some grit on it when u get bored ;)
I think to say it simply. One of the most beautiful things I've ever seen set to motion and music. And showing beautiful people. And that voice. One of a kind.

YES TRAINING SEASON is OVER 💯😎👍 Dua Lipaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa is beautiful woman 💯😎👍
💙💙💛💛🙏🙏🙏🙏🌹🌹🌹
She sat down for the whole video and gave us nothing yet somehow still served us everything
Awesome ❤
I wonder why Dua still making videos in 4:3🤔
She’s literally owning the moment 🎉
El coro cuando dice training season is over me recuerda a Baby de Marina y Luis Fonsi xd

I am glad that I am Virgo.
Thank you Mother ❤❤❤
La mejor!
Que perfeição! Eu tô viciado nessa música, que clipe maravilhoso, impecável ❤
been a fan of hers since her first album and i knew she would make it big then boom new rules came out and the rest was history. dance pop is her realm.
Gemini wouldn't allow this clip, still 5% too white
Well this is going to be a huge hit. I actually think it already is a hit in my imagination. This is followed but houd8ni, a house record breaking for best pop song to dance to. Training season is marvelous to listen to, and you can just hear the horizons of the peace and the breaks within the song. 🎵 I just can’t believe how meamoriIng these lyrics and thus song is. Even though the music video isn’t really good, this song is by far one of my favorite Dua lipa songs. It shows how you can have strength. Thus far by the power of Houdini, Houdini is just like this song. It is getting better and better every time I listen to them. Especially training season. Training is getting over mind at every place I got to. When Houdini got released, I went ahead and found the lyrics and listened to it and screamed my heart out!     Btw Houdini was not copyrighted by thriller by Michael Jackson. Thriller sounds like Houdini, but it turns out Dua tried for the songs and liked it. Houdini shows the pop thrill of breaking up and disappearing from situations. You can dance and do many trands with these songs. Thank you Dua for making and producing the songs with your prouducers. Thank for working hard for us.❤
A criadora da criatividade

yotman t es nul la musique aussi

I don't know about the rest of ya'll, but i get Transgender Vibes from Dua Lipa!!!
Wait a minute... Listening from 0:15 reminds be the beginning of 'Reamonn - Supergirl'
wee need the full albummmm pleaaaseee duaa
What happened   where is Dua  ? return us Dua Lipa!
I literally cannot get enough of Dua Lipa. Her music is literally what I crave because she always makes me want to dance and sing. I saw her back in 2021 and it was literally one of the best concerts I’ve been to. I can’t wait to go to another.
Dua lipas singing voice so good different fr her normal voice when talking, iluvher ❤
Disappointed really. Come on Dua, you can do better
👑👑✨❤️
she's showing off to her ex's like she got unlimited options and shit.....that's this song is about
❤
🎉❤
WHEN IS THE ALBUM COMING
Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair, is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there And, baby, I don't need to learn that lesson twice But if you really wanna go there You should know I Need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (training season's over) I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands? Need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul Conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team? Or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go You should know I Need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable, he's straight-talking to my soul (if that ain't you, then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload 'cause training season's over 'Cause training season's over Training season's over
It's honestly sorta depressing ngl
It seems that Tame Impala has made a significant difference compared to others. Dua and Impala have created great synergy.
TRAINING SEASON is OVER 💯😎👍 Dua Lipaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa You Are beautiful Woman 😎👍
no es el mejor trabajo q hizo, pero se aprecia!
Awesome tune! Multitasking like a boss – working and belting out tunes at the same time!
I love it 😭💕💕💕
You sound so much like Angelina Jordan. Very nice.
This is actually a great song
Such slow and boring video for such amazing music. Some party movement wouldn't harm.
She should really stay away from all those rapey illegal immigrants.
Love this song
training season is such a HIT!!
its giving yes and to me
You are amazing 😊😊

This song has been in my head non stop!!!
🇵🇸🇵🇸
Es que es guapísima eh que labios
True. Training season's over. Hunting season begins. Do you want to be his next prey? Being him Houdini do you want to get trapped in his cage ?
Dua out here making gems
Could you imagine if men actually took her advice and tried to be good at sex with/pleasing women.
I love the song ❤❤

Even if you don’t like Training Season , wake up and stream it morning through night. Everyone,go  ahead and stream NOW! Thanks.

Dua Lipaaaaaaaa 😎👍
se on dua lipan paras musiikkia!
If you're saying this to yourself "what does this song sound like" I thought the same thing an after searching through thousands of 80's songs in my library,I found it. The group is Hubert Kah, they're German, the song is Machine Gun, it came out in 89. Another song that hints at sounding the same is Indecent Obsession, Tell me Something. I think it was a going vibe in the late  80's
Dua Lipa la nouvelle reine du Pop
Music was great, video was mildly uncomfortable 😅
What a sausage fest oml
I love that I just got an ad with Dua Lipa in it 😂❤
She's still just as pretty to look at, even getting prettier, but I find that her clips have gone down in quality. Although I really liked the simplicity of Houdini's which we thought would serve as a transition to a new style.
🔥🔥🔥
I watch this mv a lot because those guys are cute like a dog in the pet shop or pet show. They are all naturally attractive, wild, behave like trained dogs. I can see it when they are speaking with their eyes at the window and sniffing around Dua Lipa. I'm not sure if they intended this but it's so fun to watch😂
❤❤❤❤❤
The guy that goes "heeey beautiful"😂🤮
2:06  3:05
Ta vraiment un talent de fou, c'est ouf, c'est magnifique
I love it I love all her songs ❤❤❤❤❤
I’m addicted to this song ❤️
2:26 мне нравится эти движения и взгляд с помадой
Que asco de publicidad, me sale hasta en la sopa. Es como colocar tu canción favorita de alarma para despertar e ir al trabajo... tarde o temprano te cansarás de ella.
Lovee from Bangladesh❤️
Boring
Dua lipa is very sexy ❤❤
This song is a smash! Just like a new artist named Nick Wealthy he has some  good songs too!. Check him out if you like this kind of music.
OMFG, this got me up and dancing right away, and no song has done that in a while. Dua is a pop queen. This song is amazing. Is it just me or am I loving her new music better? Literally my top 10 songs on my Spotify 1-Houdini 2-Dance The Night 3-One Kiss 4-Training Season 5-Murder On The Dancefloor 6-I Remember everything 7-Like a G6 8-Deja Vu 9-Cruel Summer 10-Sweet Child O Mine
what an iconic video
Always stunning Dua 🌹😌
This is fire 🔥🔥🔥
Dua needs to be protected by all costs
DUA LIPA CRESCEU MÃE NO FANTÁSTICO 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷

I get that her fans will eat up whatever she does but its genuinely not that good of a song.. And I tried to like it
I just love listening to her. She is the new   pop artist of the century She's on my bucket list for sure
Não tinha outra música no álbum melhor para single não? Essa tá muito lado B.... Sem graça 😂

Amazing job!! You are awesome Dua!!❤
I keep it on repeat and see the thousands of views digit keep changing.....ihv never witness nothing like this ❤
For the SEO ❤ Sincèrement à votre avis le son  est-il  plus important que l'image ? Pour ma part l'écoute est primordiale pour pouvoir imaginé et créer sa propre vision de l'histoire sans être influencé par une quelconque thématique.
In ten or more years time today's kids will be commenting Dua lipas songs made their childhood memorable etc etc 😊  Dua lipa is ahead of time ❤  Lots of love from Sierra Leone 🇸🇱❤️
I love you Dua

What kind of nightmare was this video 😨
They never amount to any greater than the one you had from the celestial realm.
They can never make me hate you😫
This song sucks.
ok just maybe just maaaaybee im listening to this guitar like the 17/77 or 777 time🤣🤣😁✌️🔮
¿Y dónde está la versión dance performance de ésto?   Perdón me acostumbré mucho al K-Pop 😜
Chispas el video no siento que me transmitaa algo. Osea esta en una cafetería y todos quieren con ella y luego? ...

Addicted to this song from the first listen
Omg i love youre vocie you sing so good
WOW 😮
❤
This has become one of my favorite songs of 2024 thus far!!! I have fallen more and more in love with Dua Lipa since I first heard her 5 years ago. She can do absolutely no wrong!!! 😍😍😍😍
I can't leave this song for my head.
Her voice alone
Saying it's magic would be an euphemism !  Thank you for making me happy miss Lipa !
I can just about see you in the madding crowd swirling like a cyclone in my mind the very heart of the tornado 🌪 is very piece full allmost like a heavenly tunnel of no time at all like all time has been sucked out like a vacuum of love just waiting for the calm after the storm has passed like a tunnel of love trying to find that perfect time from above the perfect timeline timelessly time and time again till its the perfect time like my rolex joke you understand time in and out shake it all about you put your left leg in in out in out you shake it all about ooo do the OK kok I that's what it's all about not realy just being daft its my medicine to be a bit daft you do understand I could never be serious unless I realy had to like well life and deaf situations  mmm I've had a few of them not very nice OK I better go take care boo love is you pickaboo
You so beautiful and hot ❤️
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life. 🙏 Have you accepted Jesus Christ into you as Lord and Savior, and Believe? God loves you, I love you, God Bless. 🙏🏻 Pray in Jesus Name Amen!  Jesus died on the cross to shed his precious blood 2 wash away all our sins 2 clean clense and save us and conquered death and risen 3 days later 2 give us a chance of eternal life if paradise! Just Confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord, and Believe in you're heart he is risen and make the Lord of your life and live Holy!
this deserves an extra tres!...tres tres tres tres bien
I never understood why we men always have to be painted as pussy-sick....
me encantaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Hi it's Drimp
kevin going crazy with these songs!! fits so well with dua's vibe and voice
Music videos are so lazy now.
Sounds like Ava Max
It's Charlie Puth, I don't what West Side did to him, that's why Music is boring, my music box is too quiet
Mind blowing voice 🤯
😮😮 just wow
I really have no idea why I've been saying training session 😂😂😂
I played continuously this song
YESSS QUEEN ♥️♥️♥️
😂😂😂😂
Who else is wondering why she's describing you?
I adore ❤️❤️
❤ si amas a Dua Lipa 🥰
I feel like they could have made a better video from such a good song. I understand what Dua is saying in the song but IDK... Video was underwhelming.
Ma non richiama molto da vicino " Sorry" di Madonna???
Yes Dua yes 🌸
Yes Dua yes 🌸
she looks pretty as always
Ficou chato demais
This deserves more views even if the video looks a bit chaotic towards the end.  Keep listening to Dua! 🎉❤ 🖤✨️
Wow, that one guy in the coat deserves a best supporting actor award for his performance.
😊😊😊
Japan Face Lion Everyone has a lion thanks to KORE 1.I was writing a novel. 2.

...DOPE!!!...

Albania is proud of you😍🥰 (Te Dua)
I see he was pointing for you but how far is it from where he came to you in his lucifirian piece that being the temple he'll never enter 😂😂😅
entendi pq tô obcecada, é o mesmo ritmo de ABBA!!!!!
DUA VOCÊ NÃO TINHA ESSE DIREITO!!!!
they are promoting this in the video .Hoard of senseless young men after a girl seems more like a nightmare for a girl.
Good night Dua Lipa .
Berta's International Weekly Top 10 Feb. 24, 2024 Top 4 LastWeek: New  Peak: 4 Weeks: 1
Seems to be a video about a bunch of beta worthless males pursuing a female that is basically worthless because she has just displayed no value. Men should have values and be worth their weight in skills and bring something to the table and pursue a woman that is honorable.
Training season has many  times  long  ago come and  gone , and a new one has  just begun.  Were gonna need alot of  luck.
So no guy is good enough? And so disappointed? Come on! And I love the song, thank you!
Tango
The MV was shot near my home! Dope!
What a boring MV. The cam just circles around her face the whole time
3 a
I'm in love
Sorry for the disturbance in the song. Im the influence. Whats going on is temporal telepathy with effect before cause going on. I.e you reacting, effect, before me viewing it and yeah my brain just doing its thing. 1k and ill stfu instead of singing along. Its not malicious i just cant turn it off
Love from Bangladesh 🇧🇩

How couldn't she even get any no.1s from her own albums beside New Rules. DSN#2 PHYSICAL#3 HOUDINI#2 and this even#4
2:08 😅
Love Dua but not feeling this one. Miss that heavy beat and strong bass line. She needs to work with someone that really lets her beautiful voice come out. I think she's beyond this and headed in the wrong direction.
Cuteee, cute cute Dua, i love you ❤
🎉🎉🎉🎉❤
Like, really... the right song at the right moment for me in a very wrong episode of my life. Expensive therapists could not do the job better. A big heart to Dua Lipa and an even bigger heart to all you girls/women out there who are insecure? Here is the remedy! <3
I love that i’m  OBSESSED with her ..
I love how Dua shows us how to love right, ourselves and others❤
This music gives me a russian music vibe, I don't know why, but it's good
Felt it❤
Estoy enojada con YouTube porque no me notificó está increíble canción
She continues putting out such AMAZING pop music! This video was a huge disappointment though.
Are you (are you) Someone that I can give my heart to? (Heart to) Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? (Drawn to) It can be hard to tell the difference late at night  Play fair (play fair) Is that a compass in your nature? (Compass in your nature) Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there (been there) And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice (learn my lesson twice)  But if you really wanna go there You should know I  Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo  Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (Training season's over)  I tried (I tried) To see my lovers in a good light (good light) Don't wanna do it just to be nice (be nice) Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right  I hope (I hope) It hits me like an arrow (arrow) Someone with some potential (potential) Is it too much to ask for?  Who understands I  Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo  Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over  Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team Or stuck on the sidelines Waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go  You should know I  Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul (if that ain't you, then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload  'Cause training season's over 'Cause training season's over Training season's over
What’s the song that’s sampled in this? Sound like a tune from tik tok
Is she the only girl there?
Best❤
your music is a gift and you are the genie out of the bottle, walking around. and no body know it yet. hehe
Now THIS is high quality pop!
Dua Lipaaaaaaaaa😎👍
This song more beautiful than Houdini
Omg baby
❤
good music, the video clip is shit,
Au 96,9 CKOI
Za future
been addicted to this song at first listen. thought houdini was a decent successor to her discography, nothing groundbreaking but this song is back to smash that off the ground?!!!!!!! big love
el video consiste tener su macho ideal dua lipa
DANG!! LOVE YOUR MUSIC
Love the song!!! <3
Congratulations dua 🎉 this is an amazing song!!!
❤
0:52
It's funny bc I just watched Feather by Sabrina Carpenter before this which basically has the same concept: all boys going crazy, acting stupid but evidently destroys themselves and each other just bc they think they can get what they want by being assertive and competitive, still never learning a lesson or two about women. AND I FCKING LOVE THIS SONGGG I HAVE IT ON REPEAT!! ❤
Забавно)  Настоящий олений хоровод!
Dua lippa Blackpink?
Video is unimaginative. But that beat, dear god.
فهمتي لبلان
When is the album expected to be out?
Dua lipa is here to stay❤
Loveeee❤ ❤this
Gonna have this on repeat all Summer!
Bullshit
❤❤You are very vocal and charming, and you have many fans in Persia (Iran), I hope one day we will see your concert here. ❤❤
Merecía un mejor video 😢...
Ela sempre entrega tudooo talentosa e gostosa, amo

so many similarities 👀 some day some day 😂🌀🏁
0:15 really thought that was Machine Gun Kelly. Was expecting him to have a verse or something the whole time. Guess its not him
Better than Houdini 4 sure
What’s that Arabic word on her hand
Lo que haces ❤ 🐺
I'd be one of the guys who want to be with Dua Lipa in the video.❤❤❤❤
Adictivo!
Amei a música, minha princesa
Underrated but best song for me:)
Me fascina.
دخلت اشوف الاعلان عشان جيني بس 🤤♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
Do we all still class this as disco? As dua said she was going in a different direction. But I still here disco and a little bit of abba
1:17 EYE CONTACT❤

I LOVE THIS
The song was🤩🤩🤩 nice not that music video 👎👎👎👅☝️☝️ sorry 😔😔
To be continued
0:44 I need his name!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gorgeous!!!!!!!!
Not living for this new era. I dont think im gonna like the rest of the album if these 2 are the chosen singles.
My repeat🎉❤
Dua Lipa and her team consistently put out hits, it's quite impressive
Soooo relatable!! ❤ my new summer bop.
From 1:00 to 1:33 SHE KILL IT!
I know Future Nostalgia whole album by heart, but this new singles for upcoming album...hm I DONT KNOW WHAT TO THINK. They sounds boring?
nada 🤢
How can I be addicted to this song on the first listening ? Incredible...
I don't like this song
Some of her biggest hits were slow growers on the charts. I wouldn't be surprised if that happens here. But if it doesn't, who cares? What a bop!!!
I LOVE U
What a clip!
Funny how I got a advertisement starring Dua Lipa before watching a Dua Lipa music video
❤❤❤
Dua lipa allows my favourite ❤
i cant even explain how much i love this song, the lyrics, the vibe everything ❤ love ya dua lipa
🥰🥰😍😘
Duuuuuuuuzzzza
pretty red girl, this music was like oh goood
Great pop song  by D L.
Dislike. Antisemitism is not cool.
Evet Dua Lipa, Polat'tan da esinlenerek Cerrahpaşalılar'ın kahvesini basmış.
love this song 💖

🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝🔝From Brazil  Great performance !! Increible producion !! Magnifique production !! Excelente produção !!
beautiful song❤
Yürü be tülay abla
Thats so cool ❤❤❤❤❤
Like the deeper tone she uses around 2:40 than I do the higher pitch most of this song uses-  simply a big fan of the older unique sound Be the One, Dont Start Now really lets her pipes shine-  this song is nice sure, but I hope the people evolving her sound get her back to her unique range and power-
Don't know if someone is reading this, but if you are: You are amazing and beautiful! I believe in you! ❤
First time dua has wore proper cloth in her video .
me da um ódio do ultimo refrão não se repetir, fico esperando a musica toda por 2 refrões no final
amoooo ✨
Bridge hits chorus hits lyrics absolute masterpiece 🙌🏼 obsessed
Le refrain est auf
Dua lipa❤ jeg er en kæmpe fan af dig ❤😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

The bridge hits. Chorus is amazing yessss!!!!! You look amazing

In each different era, year, style and music album Dua Lipa strikes differently in many beautiful and gorgeous hairstyles that makes her unique in most of her songs and music albums:  2015-2018: Deluxe album era (black hair) 2019-2022: Future nostalgia album era (blonde & black hair) 2023-2024: Radical Optimism album era (red hair)

Have discovered that people that only have 1 basket of knowledge instead of three. Have disgusting habits that allow the streptococci on their faces and in their ears to increase. The streptococci can then take over their brain function. And that is how we have evil in people. They are always wanting.

Maybe it's just me, but the more I listen to this, the more it sounds as though it has a sample from the Knight Rider theme tune...  🤭 🚗
The Queen of Pop of these days
Different vibes 😃
Poor duva lipa just had the dream but While the rest Sharon Osbournes everybody hahah woaaahh
Poor marijaserifovic

Great evolution and development for Dua Lipa in terms of music style, dance choreography, vocals, attitude and bravery from her first hit "be the one" she went hiatus and astonishing with her latest number 1 masterpiece jam hit "training season" that will gonna blast and dominates the charts aroud the world in this year of 2024 and I'm living for it❤
This looks like Malena scence with the cigarettes😊
класс! ябывдул!😉😋
music 100000/10 video 1/10
Kinda giggling in amazement that Dua now likes blurry things... You go girl......
אנטישמית בת שרמוטה אבל שיר נדיר יבוא לך
Gurl if u are bored in your own music video imagine us watching it.
I swear most of her songs are just straight up bops. I am so glad she is still making bop after bop and she isn't disappointing
Even the music videos are full of illegals. 🌚
very very very beautiful song. You are wonderful!🙂
Queen
5.5M ? What happen with the people
Who’s the buzz cut guy
Love her! Omg this video made me so uncomfortable lol
Thought this sounded very Tame Impala and just read Kevin Parker produced it! what a collab!
Why so many blacks in the video ? Don't get it.
😬
Oh my God she has finally left the synth wave/funk behind, first song from her I add to my playlist since New Rules
😂❤❤❤
واتتت
How could someone not wanna dance to this song?  Dua Lipa did it again!
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🌺🌺🌺🌺🌺🚔💯💯💯🎼🎼🎼🎼
Listening to this on headphones hits different
❤❤❤❤ amo
YOUR DREAM WILL BECOME TRUE

The video seems like a Pro-Feminist 😂
boring song...creative video
OMG you're awesome! ANd the red hairs are amazing! You sing so well! Anyway, keep sing.
Будуар императрицы повидал немало на своем веку Кавалеров вереницы навевают на неё теперь тоску Только сердцу не прикажешь, сердце просит продолжения любви И вечерний экипаж её уносит на окраину Москвы
*She never disappoints.*
Woooooooow 😍🎧🎶💃🏾🕺🏿🎸🥁

Any one else expecting David Hasselhoff and Kitt to start singing 😂  Bloomin fantastic song.
FREE PALESTINE . BOYCOTT ISRAEL
Anyone who loves dua lipa and her voice give attendance😊😊 👇👇
Pas un flop à son actif c’est dingue d’être si balaise
Crazy how nowdays we less watch music video. I remember back in the day, Fifth harmony break a record for the music video of "That's my girl" with 5 million of view in 24 hours. And now, it's been 5 days since the release of "Training season" and it got "only" 5 million view.
She is gorgeous ❤❤❤
Meow meow😍😍🔥
Love you Dualipa UwU

Filling like a Concert ❤❤

❤ so Wonderful 🔊
Oh merde ... J'adore ❤
Better than Houdini ngl 🤫
It's a shame this isn't racking up the views like her old stuff. Her quality control over her music is immaculate and this song is really good.
Love her but i am so waiting for that ultra power ballad to change it all up.
Que gran canción
Te amoo❤
I love this song, but the chorus of this song sounds a bit familiar. but can't really what it was.😂😂
Love from Pakistan ❤
POP IS IN THE HOUSE!! 🎉🎉
Ni olivia rodrigo fracasó tanto como esta señora, aun la olivia tiene buenos streams en spotify pero esta señora no eso tiene ya, houdini un flopazo y este otro flopazo hasta el performance de los grammys de miley cyrus tiene más vistas que esta canción. 😂😂
This was phenomenal from start to finish... Ya'll I am so ready for this chapter after Future Nostagia - that album was so good and I didn't think it could get better but here we are! I am so hyped for this new era AHHHH. The visuals of this were so good and I LOVE the red colour scheme! ❤❤❤
I love it
Your music resonates with my soul. Love you, Dua.
Goddess absolute goddesssss🥵🤠🔥😍
Dios mío , treaning season es una joya y no lo están valorando, solo los verdaderos LOVES amamos lo que hace DIOSA LIPA ❤
Wow
Fuck yeah Dua Lipa
Such a good song 🩷 Dua Lipa is amazing
I don't know why, but I just don't like her music. Rihana from beginning of this century okay, but SHE doesn't suit me fine
Does this training session, I mean, season have new rules or the same old ones. 🤡 Well, it says it's over now.😅So never mind.
I had no idea there was a visual representation of the Tinder ratio until I saw this video
Como sienpre mi Dualupa genial me encanta ❤❤❤
Que música boa de ouvir ❤❤
song name plssss
Un despropósito total este video!
You know what? I've been waiting a lot for this to happen,  I was impatient for a new album and a New single, but I read somewhere on the Internet that Dua said she didn't Want to Rush her music, she was taking her time to create something great to give us and now I see what she was meaning. They'd say: God's timing is perfect. I'd say: Goddess timing is perfect. ❤
All eyez on mary. 🎲
lleva haciendo la misma música como por 4 casi 5 años
Lol
The bridge hits. Chorus is amazing yessss!!!!! You look amazing
cake by the ocean...? anyone? no? k
I like the music video and the lyrics of the song is nice.
Dua lipa no se si estas viendo esto y tampoco si entendes mucho español pero quiero q sepas q amo tu musica y q sos increíble segui asi reina👑❤  Espero q logres todo lo q quieras ❤
te amo ❤
Dua lipa go hard
How is this only 5 million views??  This song & video are 🔥
(A fan to Fanclub, 2nd round) 🌙   Q: Who is talking to soul?   A. Call center guy! B. Rodeo! C. Ramp walker! D: Observer!

A true soldier never gives up (training sessions never ends actually) .  Fans are passionate, Torture poetry out of Town, the Cup is full of ‘no sugar’. Only Humanity & Halmark 👑.  Cuz, This is the day, that they always remember the day that they almost caught Captain J@ck $p@rrow…❤️‍🔥  Thank You Indeed once again 👑

A EQUAÇÃO  Como explicar o circuito dos afetos? Há em todos, que atribuo perseguição, o método de sacrifício, que pode ser “trazer-me para a realidade”, falar de mim. Não sei o que ou quem autoriza essa ação, mas cogito ter sido ensinado por alguém. Ou mesmo, ao longo do tempo, a pessoa começou a se sentir responsável por carregar informações privadas sobre a minha vida. A orientação das pessoas nas suas vivências, sejam culturais ou sociais, imprimem afetos sobre um determinado sujeito: Eu. Elas se sentem no desejo de reportar o que vira e sentira, e ou criam métodos para lidar com toda essa elaboração (essa expressa aqui). Eu estou cercado pessoas dentro de circuitos, inclusive a minha família, que fazem sacrifícios e oferendas. Isso é sofrimento, além do fato de que esse mecanismo, essa fiação, essa rede, induz a entender que a o sujeito que está no centro “é deslumbrado”, pois é muito paparicado, “não liga”, é indiferente com a vulnerabilidade, afinal os olhos de anjos e demônios estão voltados para ele.  ***  Bem, se analisarmos essa intricada teia social e econômica sob uma lente apocalíptica, poderíamos vislumbrar um cenário digno de um blockbuster distópico, com a economia política e social transformando-se em um verdadeiro palco de absurdos.  Imaginem um mundo onde o circuito dos afetos não é apenas uma questão de fofocas e intrigas familiares, mas sim a base para uma economia bizarra e distorcida. As pessoas, ávidas por sua dose diária de drama, se tornam participantes ativas nesse espetáculo social, transformando cada detalhe da vida de alguém em uma commodity valiosa.  O método de sacrifício, antes simplesmente uma maneira de "trazer alguém para a realidade", agora se torna um tributo obrigatório para manter a economia do caos funcionando. As oferendas à família se tornam uma espécie de imposto emocional, onde cada membro paga sua quota de sofrimento para manter a engrenagem do circuito dos afetos girando.  O sujeito no centro, o deslumbrado da vez, torna-se uma espécie de ícone econômico. Ele é paparicado e idolatrado não apenas pela família, mas por toda uma sociedade que vive para assistir e comentar seu espetáculo. A indiferença do sujeito em relação à vulnerabilidade não é apenas uma característica pessoal, mas um reflexo da desumanização que ocorre quando a vida se torna um reality show permanente.  Enquanto anjos e demônios observam de seus camarotes cósmicos, a sociedade mergulha em um apocalipse de superficialidade e desintegração moral. O valor real é substituído pelo entretenimento barato e pela exploração emocional, levando a um colapso social onde as relações reais são sacrificadas no altar da audiência e do espetáculo. O verdadeiro apocalipse não está nas catástrofes naturais, mas na autodestruição causada pela obsessão coletiva pelo drama e pela exposição pública.
+How much times you listen? -Yes.

Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night.   Play fair, is that a compass in your nature or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there and baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice.   But if you really wanna go there, you should know   I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known, whose lovе feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control. Whеn I'm vulnerable, he's straight talking to my soul, conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo.   Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show you. If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah, 'cause training season's over. (Training season's over...)   I tried to see my lovers in a good light. Don't wanna do it just to be nice. Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right.   I hope it hits me like an arrow. Someone with some potential, is it too much to ask for? Who understands   I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known, whose lovе feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control. Whеn I'm vulnerable, he's straight talking to my soul, conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo.   Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show you. If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah, 'cause training season's over.   Can you compete? Now is your time, run when you hear that whistle blow. Are you on my team or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go?   You should know I need someone to hold me close, deeper than I've ever known, whose lovе feels like a rodeo, knows just how to take control. Whеn I'm vulnerable, he's straight talking to my soul, conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo   'Cause training season's over. 'Cause training season's over. Training season's over.

i interpreted as a huge dispute between these men to get her attention and for her choose someone. and she is like on a casual clothe, sitting and 100% not caring about them or getting their attention on her, but they are desperate. she knows that these "attractive" men are all the same. they dont fit to what she needs and deserves, so she is like "leave me alone you suckers"  i loved this spiritual state
Excelente 👍

I don't understand the hate towards this video, this is PEAK CINEMA

Just dua sitting in a coffee shop iconic
Dua should use her lower register more😩
Glad that this one doesn’t sound so much like the other ones, still fun and upbeat and she served on this one ❤

O refrão me lembra alguma música do Systen ou do Serj Tankian 😅 Mas muito boa!
I love u me DUA
Dua lipa nunca decepciona 🇧🇷🫶😍

Boring track by her standards
there's such an interesting vibe to this video.. something that is different...
Good
Tiene una similitud con el intro yes and ariana Grande

La primera canción que escucho de lua lipa y me gusto🎉
Hits 💥💥💥
I donot like yogur New style 😢
👍🐝🦷♥️👯‍♀️🪇🍶💖🇺🇸
💗
I wasn't crazy about Houdini but hearing this I still prefer Houdini. There are some Dua Lipa songs I just don't click with. Don't Start Now was one of them. Training Season is another. I hope she got better than this on her next album or this new era is going to be a very short one.
Good vibes
Love Sweet moves here Feel it heart soul. Amen Amen Amen faith 🌹🌹🌹
When does the video starts?
Dua Lipa 🔥🔥🔥🔥😎😎😎
ela tá tão perfeita ruiva
0:43 the most handsome man I have ever seen!
I dont even listen to the radio but this is a BOP. I love that song she did with Hwasa as well
Und wieder nur irgendwelche Mullukken im Clip 🤮
I can't believe that people are saying that all her songs sound the same.
Dua es the best artisbof the year!!!❤
fish
love the right, tatoo
Honestly, I get it. 💁🏾‍♀️
Her lyrics are always kinda... the same? Like "Oh, I need a rush of love, can you handle it, can you handle me, come on boy lalalala?" Lol... yeah, it's a "nice" pop song... but is it really?
Wow 😍😍😍
very sexy singer - magnificent
Yes
❤
❤❤❤Kosovo is heart od Serbia! ❤❤❤
Amazing song, love it but music video is a bit underwhelming  Edit: the song itself outdoes all video flaws, spectacular and catchy song!
Me encantó! Desde de Mexico dua eres impresionante 😊! ❤
Cliche Pop song. Who here can name 5 pop songs literally...literally with this whole sound vibe feel and bpm? Nothing special. A Pop song from a white person vs a black country song just doesn't make sense. This song is so basic omg. If ur into music u couldn't think wow this is so new fresh Pop

danggggg what a banger, well deserved alarmschijf at qmusic <3

Sound like K-pop musik. Better than anothers.
Well that was boring
addictive af
uncomfortable music video..and the tune didn't do it for me
Did dua lipa try to make the scariest mv ever? she succeded
The video reminds me of JLo's "Papi".
Yine bizi şaşırtmadın güzel bayan
I like how accurately the average modern woman's body count is portraited in this visual.  Thank you Dua for exposing this.
Dua Lipa is literally carrying pop on the top of her beautiful shoulders🐐
She's Coming and we are not prepared for this greatness🐐
I don't like this music video, because so much man in this video.
freedom for palestine
India Attendance here🇮🇳
Nao gostei, achei mais do mesmo. Esperava algo maior sabe? A musica em si nao agrada e o clipe achei fraco e sem grandes motivos para emplacar. Ela nao vai conseguir entrar no top 10 ou Billboard com isso. Adoro a Dua mas esse nao comoveu.

Nothing special in the song. So generic. Still arrangements are pretty good
In loveeee with the lyricsssssssss, slayyyyyyyy
Ok, she’s definitely been taking us back in time.

DUA, YOU WOULD LIKE IT, HUH? (Sorry, I'm gay!)
Me
I came here cause tiktok love this song🤩
Im too excited for this album
What I like about this song is that it's called Training Season and the very last line is Training Season's over.  Very satisfying
Que vuelvan los 80    esto meda una ezperanza genuina ❤
🤩💘😘😍🔥💕
Excelente cancion
To whoever is listening to this song now, wherever you are.... Sending you love, peace, healing and all good wishes. May your life be good❤
Бимба
She never misses
is it just me or it gives 2000s vibes?
I likee, this is really a deep song, a deep topic. I´m feeling that way, I feel like this song  also describing the way I feel about my relationships.
HEY LASCIA ENTRARE ASCANIO
There Should be a dance Presentation to that song
Pop music is on fire with Dua again 🔥🔥🔥
Je la trouve très belle Dua lipa 🖤❤💜❤🖤❤💜💘💜❤❤❤❤❤
Encore mieux que Houdini j'aime beaucoup sa nouvelle chanson elle envoie du lourd 😍😍🖤❤💜💜
You can’t compare Dua with the voice potential and skills of Ariana and Lady Gaga.. also is not that good song..
AMAZING!
Love you Dua Lipa ❤
SO im gonna need some IG names from this video
Maravilhosa,sempre entregando ❤
Amazing song 🔥👍💯
She s a superstar!
Que Buen ritmo. !!   ✨✨,✨,
Dua can I be your ex?
Dua, where do you apply?
שיר שמעודד אורגיה המונית אהבתי .. דואה איפה מגישים מועמדות ???
Why is there so many black peoples in Britain 😰
J'adore je suis hyper fan
よすぎるよおおおお🥺🩶❤❤❤❤❤
I insist in the perfect production of the Dua Lipa sonsgs. Everything fits perfectly, either a piano, a synth, vocal harmonies....together with a catchy melody
Amazing bridge

I love Dua Lipa and having this album produced by Kevin Parker is like also having a brand new Tame Impala record... This combination is just amaizing
Encontró el timing para lograr que toda la música que hace suene espectacular: melodía, letra, estribillo, su voz, mezcla todo con mucha calidad. Es muy raro ver artistas que obtengan esto porque es extremadamente difícil de alcanzar. Dejando esto de lado, tengo mi propia playlist de Dua y training season la tengo por arriba del puesto 20, la voy escuchando varias veces y por ahora, me cuesta subirla a mejores puestos. Ese es el hermoso problema de Dua, lo que venía haciendo es grandioso, demasiada música buena.
Why is nobody talking about how the bridge sounds basically the same to that of the song "tokyo nights" by digital farm animals 🤯 I cant unhear it
Same shit
The video kinda reminds me of Jennifer Lopez Papi music video with all the men attracted to her.
In a room like this I’d want to be a joint
Like si estás desde antes de los 100M
Nice but it sounds quite similar to Baby -  by Clean Bandit
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ indo...
Her lyrics are getting better and better
She is the moment
Vertigo 🌀
Can't wait to listen to DL3
Pop excellence
Dua is stunning
ainda bem que ela está tomando um cafézinho. a cara ta de cansada . musica maravilhosa <3
The bridge part is so amazing
U got 2 take my word 4 it but I just gave it some SPICE and rocked that FN song socks off on my Piano🎹 and Electric Guitar🎸 Too bad no one will ever hear itcuz it was FN epic!!!
АОАОАОАООААААОАОАО УЖЕ Я ЛЮБЛЮ ЭТУ ПЕСНЮ УЖЕ
You know it's sad when you think it's refreshing to see a celebrity scrunch their face 😂😂😅 I'm really happy she hasn't gone overboard with botox like so many others. Unrelated to the song I know but still wanted to say bc she looks gorgeous in this video 💕
I like it 🔥🔥🔥 good song
Yo ho ho ho ❤
The song is incredible. I listen to it on repeat. The video, however, doesn't go anywhere... it's the same thing from start to finish and doesn't do the song justice.

1:54 is my fav parttttt
We love you Dua Lipa ❤️❤️ Lots of love from India
เริศเกินนน❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
Good song but don't like the video clip.  It is kind of creepy that many men are having a fight and going crazy for her.  She knows how to tease her fans.   Current world is too depressing, many people fighting over petty life matters.  Relatable song perhaps for others but depressing  chaotic visuals. 🌀 It's sad that many guys think that they matter at all, when Dua doesn't care.  Too commercial song.  🌈
Dua evolution is insane.. she is top notch now ❤
She just described some if not most relationship in our current world
💗💗
Petition to release the scrapped vid 😫
I am a fan of this song ❤️
Baru 3 hari yang menonton banyak 😅❤
How good is this ❤❤❤😊
Love it ❤.
I am pretty positive my ear had a orgasm 😅❤ 😍
She makes good music and More like a girl anthem ❤ Love Dua Lipa
The kind of song that the chorus plays endlessly in your head ❤
She looks amazing - her songs again are brilliant - but the videos are a bit lacklustre compared to the last albums singles.
PO
remix is cool too )
COOL!

Dua Lipa has such a beautiful strong voice.  Love her richness on her low, high and falsetto notes

The rotating set must have been nausea inducing at first.
Salvando o pop novamente 😮

You should all listen to the acapella version and the instrumental because then you really get a sense of how full this song actually is. So many layers and a beautiful depth
Ahh dua lipa pretty smm
I want more my wife dua
musica ruim, deleta amg
Direct To Faves 💛
Essa mulher ruiva é o momento 🤤
admiro a los compositores, toman un poco de aquì, un poco de allà y lo mezclan inteligentemente, puedo reconocer aires de tango por ahì, algo de musica española por allà
the katy perry of the new generation, but went straight to witness flop era =(
Medio tema… me gusta las canciones son de un buen autoestima, no quieren una relación tóxica y que ya saben lo que quieren. Claro que si, el entrenamiento se acabó! ❤️‍🩹👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
i dont care if is a big sucess or not, BUT THIS IS QUALITY
Ok, the music is ab fab!!!!! But I don't get the meaning of the video..... As a Moroccan ( North African )... I don't know....what is it with the African American ( stunning by the way😊😊 ) casting and the other kinda Irish guys at the end....I can't believe it's still there!!!!!
STOP
Tadinha da Dua Lipa, tava querendo tomar um chá da tarde mas uns 100 machos tava enchendo o saco. Qualquer problema maior, chame a Sabrina Carpenter que ela resolve ⚰️
This hits different in pop music today!!🔥💯
people be like: she always releases the same songs No she doesn’t and y’all love it when Taylor Swift does lol
Why she looks so gorgeous 🥹
Been waiting for the choreography
The 3 guys in start looks like timberlake, usher and eminem 😁

I miss Dua Lipa with black hair
I'M HERE EVERYDAY!BCS HER MUSIC WAS LITTTT ❤❤❤❤
Solo la oí una vez y ya me la aprendí, la amé completamente.
I love your Music !!! 🙌🏽💙
Please come back to Canada to make your videos. This is not good!
😍😍🔥
Dua Lipa face is like: 😒😒😒😒. Good song!
Kevin Parker did this for Dua Lipa and among other collaborations, imagine for her next album.  Kevin Parker is a true genius in the music industry.
Арестован, в стиле Ангела норм)
Видать парня нет, такие клипы) Но музыка на 3)
Dua Lipa te amo
maybe shes just a lesbian lmao
Типо все мужики повились) Да Она супер) честно:)
Average metro ride scene.
Amei essa música, assim como todas as outras da Dua , ela é incrível.
Прикольная песня, мне сразу понравилось❤
ja
🤩
ig del rubio que esta sentado al lado de ella?
Perfect! Cheers!

I love the song, but the video feels awfully intimidating. I was scared the whole time that they'd grab her.
omg, Dua you got me stuck on repeat
YES QUEEN
love dua she is so pretty
meh , last two releases are more of the same . Seems to be going backwards ..
اغانيها كلهن طرب🦧
I love you❤😢

Someone call the fire department because this song is setting my heart ablaze! 🔥❤️
Pocos chicos para tanta belleza y talento😂💖🧡✍️

Khaa jaaunga tujhe dua👉👈
eu achei que houdini tinha sido fraquinha mas essa superou
This song is amazing dua 💟 The voice, the visuals, the editing, the camera angle, the expressions, the eye movements of everyone! Everything is phenomenal and unique :-) Training Session ❤️👏🏻
(Note to video editors) Don't put black bars on a 4:3 video
Love Dua's red hair
Amazing!❤🇧🇷🇧🇷
So smooth
Whoever came up with the idea to put a piano at min 2:47 deserves a rise.
0:59 cinema 🚬
Dua Lipa la chanteuse pop britannique la plus populaire sort deux chansons et un album qui peut être un précédent des çes deux albums dua lipa et futur nostalgia les meilleurs de sa carrière elle est incroyable
No soy fan de dua pero sin dudas este me parece el mejor video de todos los que tiene. La estética, la vibra que trasmite, los colores. Ella está divina. desde el min 3:07 hasta el final me parece unas de las mejores partes del video. el efecto de todos los muchachos alrededor de ella y ella sentada ahí indiferente, masterpiece.  Me encanto
omg thats really inedit!
Sembra di essere a Tripoli bah... ormai il diktat è  quello
Loved it!!! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥 I hear some Get, Get Down melody and it’s perfect!!!
👍
If you wanna see true femenine queen energy, this video is the masterclass. Absolutely love it 🔥
This clip is boring
Niente, non ce n'è per nessuna. La regina è lei. La voce più elegante al mondo
Un toque de tango? 🇦🇷 MI PAIS
Argentina Love her. ❤❤❤❤❤
Her best son yet, the buid-up is truly amazing, the lyrics are terrific!
The world will say "banger".
Mi himno ❤
Vibe is ❤️‍🔥
Sa yll Dua!
Such an icon already
Como sempre FANTÁSTICA. Dua, você é impecável em todos os seus comebacks!❤🦋💕😍
Dua never disappoints us❤
I love Dua lipa so much. What is AMS99W
This is another work from the upcoming album, it will definitely be a perfect retro album
Love this song
Ok this electronic song is next this and Ariana have it .
Yes you have to have very special skills to do what she does musically. Energy not sure yet
This era’s singles are so good when you don’t have some annoying white twink saying all her new music sounds like Future Nostalgia
Good try. Lol nice video though.  Backfire. I notice things other people don't ❤
4M in 2 days🫠You are the best 💖

Giving a Monica Bellucci from Malena vibes
Lady Gaga Venus ... idk why 😅
I thought when Dua announced about training season,she was gonna training for concert tour.never knew it’s a song title
Too goooooood music ❤🎉
Doesn't it remind you of Jennifer Lopez's Papi video?
I' m hungry but no one can't feel that, by the way I will choosing Dua Lipa's shine but no one can't feel that.

😮😍 3:00
Dua lipa is very beautiful, that look and those lips are what make her a very attractive woman, her talent as a singer is unique ❤️😍
My fav song🖤🎧🎤 Ily Duaaa🖤
"I don't want to have to teach you." Preach. Thank you for your support of Palestine. Your humanity shines brightly. ✌🏻💜
Hey, I've made a cover of training season in my channel so it would make me very happy if you'd check it and support my channel
.
this kinda reminds me of that Jennifer Lopez video “Papi”
❤
The song is epic  The video is boring though
Sww
This is Tame Impala Coded Anyway Kevin Parker produce this song
dua LOVE U
And again Dua saved Music Industry, i cant wait for Grammys 2025 <3
Isso sim é uma música de qualidade ❤
Te amo reina. Inigualable
iTunes Top 200の中で存在感のある少しハスキーな歌声にどこか懐かしく感じるディスコサウンドがとてもキャッチ－で力強く、思わず体が動き出してしまうほどのビートの”ノリ”がいいネ(^^♪ グラミーでの圧巻のパフォーマンスのMVが公開されてから凄い勢いで再生回数を更新されていますよね 👀 3rd アルバムへの期待が高まるようなプロモーション戦略もさることながら彼女のセルフ・プロデュース能力は群を抜いていると感じます。 さすが、次世代のレディー・ガガと呼び声が高いだけあって、独自の感性で装うファッションセンスで記憶に残るスター性のあるアーティスト☆(^^ゞ
We want you in mawazine 2024🇲🇦
This video had nothing to do with anything training related it's just another music video that has a big celebrity with the poperatsy the most biggest Hollywood cleahay that has been seen a lot of times
Esse vídeo me lembra o  video da cantora brasileira trans Urias so que o dela e mais direto nas letra e arranjos
I love you Dupa!! 🤍
It might grow on me. 😩
"And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice"❤❤
Me suena un poco a una, canción de u2-get out of your own way 🤔
To my sis hope you an pleasant birthday coming lil sis gifi😅

Training Season Lyrics  [Verse 1] Are you (Are you) Someone that I can give my heart to? (Heart to) Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? (Drawn to) It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair (Play fair) Is that a compass in your nature? (Compass in your nature) Or are you tricky 'cause I've been there? (Been there) And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice (Learn my lesson twice)  [Pre-Chorus] But if you really wanna go there You should know I  [Chorus] Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose lov? feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control Wh?n I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo  [Post-Chorus] Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (Training season's over)  [Verse 2] I tried (I tried) To see my lovers in a good light (Good light) Don't wanna do it just to be nice (Be nice) Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope (I hope) It hits me like an arrow (Arrow) Someone with some potential (Potential) Is it too much to ask for?  [Pre-Chorus] Who understands I  [Chorus] Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo  [Post-Chorus] Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over  [Bridge] Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team or stuck on the sidelines Waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go  [Pre-Chorus] You should know I  [Chorus] Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul (If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload  [Outro] 'Cause training season's over 'Cause training season's over Training season's over  ❤

AMAZING! Dua is just very talented. LOVE IT <3
sooo good, I kind of hear "reach out i'll be there" by the four tops, which is a favorite of mine!
Why was the clip shot in Africa and Africa is not visible at all?
Why does the thumbnail resemble the black mascara thumbnail of Raye??

My smart, super talented and beautiful (little sis) Dua! The song is a blast! Keep it up sweetheart, sooo proud of you. And for that Albanian you rocked in the show, a biiig hug.
Well….. not what I expected unfortunately
Good job Dua . Also reminds me of JLo- Papi ( just a bit )
SHE LOOKS LIKE JAMES CHARLES 😭
Legend! Beautiful! Just soooo perfect
🔥
I need the lyric
This song samples Kylie Minogue/Calvin Harris cover of "Love is the Drug" released on 2007.
Dua Lipa is absolutely gorgeous and has grown so much as an artist. Go Girl!!!
Is this a femcel music video?
I love this with my world ❤❤❤
Hey lascia entrare Ascanio dall'8 di Gennaio
Pop music is still alive for Dua Lipa like Ariana Grande did!
That ABBA-esque piano riff at 2:45 min point…. Pure pop delight
I love this song. She always brings fresh air to pop music. Also love the music video. She‘s simply sitting and serving. Less is more sometimes.
catchy
когда на Мамбе осталась единственная реальная женщина
Literally can’t help but dance on a first listen GAWD DAMN
Are we not gonna talk about the literal insane rizz that Dua's Siren aura provoke in this dudes...and she was like...um..ok..weird...goddes literal goddes❤
I really like the song but God what a bad video! Dua looking bored from start to finish....At least in Houdini she moved.
🍯🎮🍯
❤️‍🔥🍷❤️‍🔥
Disco + 90’s vibes
Yes
dua is running the pop industry and we love to see it 😌
Te dua Dua😍😍😍🇦🇱🇦🇱

Great song and video

Can you compete? Now is you time run when you here that whistle to blow.Are you on my team or stuck on the side lines waiting for someone to tell you to go?
Зе бест оф зе бест!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
You guys all are sleeping on this song, this deserves so much more recognition!! Dua is back with another masterpiece once more ❤❤
She is a legend of pop music
Dua is pure art 🖼️ ❤

Amoooooo
Como todo lo que haces mi bella Dua😊❤
Galaaaaaactic slayyy
Me encanta esta canción de día
amazing visuas at the end. Love the song to.
The video is disappointing. This song deserved something way more dynamic. What is the video about anyway?
que aflição esse vídeo 😂
When I do think music now a days isn’t as good then I do think wait we have Dua lipa she’s incredible
I wanted to listen to this song so I clicked it and before it there was a Dua Lipa ad from Saint Laurent❤❤❤
She is the QUEEN of pop 👸❤💢🥁🎸
This sounds like k-pop hahahaha
OMG!! She is at her best, in my opinion this is one of the songs totally different from the ones she sings and composes herself... ❤
Fuck this comment section was completly taken over by bots
Really like Dua but this is mediocre at best - 17th at Eurovision vibes. Very forgettable.
feel like Dua Lipas album this year will be the album of the year.
Byby ❤
I'm such a fan, keep them coming.
No one can sing better than her ❤
❤
Eu super gostei da música 🎷
Boring nothing new
❤
I really like the version performed during the Grammys, is it not possible to publish it? 👋♥️
Dua red  head is the best
😊
GOT ME FEELING VERTIGOOOOOOOOOO
This voice sounds heavily modified.
Why are the views so low? I hate YouTube
TE QMO
3.385
Love Dua's videos. They are often simple and look low-budget, but still are very fascinating and, more importantly, do not distract from song itself
Is the album is half as good as this song and this video and this concept in general THEN IS GOING TO BE A BOPPPPP
Glamours
Thanks!
Another amazing hit…❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥🔥🔥🔥
Who else can hear tame impalas let it happen at the end 😊😊
Dear Dua, if you read this, please never stop making music. I just wanna dance my whole life with you! In love Sash…🕺💃

Dua lipa: yo si quiero alguien chido  alguien que si se rompa la madre por mi , por que la temporada de chingaderas se acabo! No podemos poner eso … ok  “Training season’s over”
I just want to know if they literally put out a casting call for the ugliest rarchet guys out there???

Ironically  the song sounds like a whirlpool. Musically and visually everything begins to spin and then stops in the chorus. What makes you feel like VERTIGO.🌪🌀🌀🌀
Love bug all i can say is please make a movie Love bug all i can say is please make a movie with Johnny Depp .
Her voice is infallible but the song sucks. Houdini sucks too. Too often the lyrics of her songs are cringy.
Mas essa mulher não tem uma música ruim, que esse álbum venha logo. Animado pra nova era da dula peep.
Todos los hombres la desean quiso decir y como no lo harían
Nice song horrifically boring music video
❤❤❤
I swear to God it sounds just like that song "Scatman (ski-ba-bop-ba-dop-bop)"
When the guys are spinning around here, the image is like a renaissance painting! The colour, the angle! 3:07
Seee

Houdini e training season são músicas boas, mas ainda prefiro a era Future Nostalgia, não acho q essa era irá superar.

baby, my love... what a gift. a flex.
Amazing song i love it
Her music production is amazing! I Like her music more that Taylor Swift! But i guess they are somehow different in terms of music style.
@pastoverdenutricaoanimal
Dua never misses. Another absolute banger
Love the vibe of your new songs sooooo much!! Going through same times, can relate to every word. Your new songs give me so much energy & support every time I listen to them! Thank you for your art, Dua! Can't wait for a new album!❤‍🔥
She's so hot, I wanna be like her (I'm a str8 guy)
Me encanta viva Dua Lipaa❤❤..🇨🇴✨
When are you gonna release your next song?
Future nostalgia was my fav the year it was released so i really wait for this one
You all do realize she takes old songs best and makes her own which is why it feels she’s making hits because she’s recreating former hits duh
знаешь флоп тот еще, но качает
Razzmatazz un sábado noche...
Great song by Tame Impala with featured vocals of Dua Lipa 👌🫡
Love the song, the video is… I expected more action!
She's conceited and she has 99 reasons !!
This video reminds me of JLo's "papi" video
Amazing song. A little weird hearing her using high pitch but sounds amazing anyways. Saludos from Argentina DUA!
A dua passando o clipe inteiro sentada, amoo kkk
UGHHHH! I can't stop listening to this 😭😭
Que iconica por favor
TEMAZOO❤
Way better than the Houdini vid, which was weak.
I just finished watching this video and it was really down to earth
Another hit by Dua
I bet we can reach even more views. She's giving us an amazing song and video ❤🎉
No entiendo el video
the chorus sounds EXACTLY like “Tokyo nights” by Digital Farm Animals what even
Dua ur voice  is magical
No entiendo el video
The chorus EASILY could have been an ABBA song.
Great song. I really love the background. Dua have never disappointed. Her music sounds very unique. 👍
حب ❤
A Dua Lipa parece muito a atriz Vitória Strada. ❤
Stream  Yes and by Ariana Grande
❤❤❤
Boring same genre everytime SAFE PLAY
This song sounds like beach house
I love this song so muuuch
Como siempre, Dua nos da una obra de arte ✨
She said: It's a man's world, but Baby, I'm The Sun.
Training season over
La canción es una maravilla.. lo q me preocupa es el equipo de Dua, parece q no supieron promocionar bien su lanzamiento, porque mientras q Houdini tuvo 13M de visitas en un día, este sólo tuvo 2M..
This video is sooo beautiful. I adoreeeeee❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
This deserves more views :(
a
Cada vez la amo más 😔👊
This sounds powerful!

Boring! But ok
C'est vraiment tout ce dont j'avais besoins
Never disappoints. You are my impossible love 👑 DuaLipa 👑
I love this song
I wasn’t a fan of Dua Lipa, but this new songs 🥵 can’t wait to see the album
She is so beautiful 😍
😍😍😍😍😍
Let's understand that when you take off your clothes, that doesn't mean you're going to be prettier
I LOVEEE ❤❤❤❤
Lyric comment?
She has her own style, her own way of singing, just so phenomenally good 👍
Dua ❤❤
Ah man Dua really picking up Kanye’s slack with a great video!
best song ever
Eita como canta e como é linda
dua in red hair is the best gender
The Queen delivers once again. Thank you Dua Lipa, we adore you!!
too many immigrants in this music video
Люблю ❤

This is the catchiest, most instant Abba-esque song since Hung Up in 2005 🔥🔥 Pop perfection ON REPEAT.
Let's be honest. DUA LIPA has NEVER released a bad song.
Am I the only one obsessed with the way she says “arrow”
🤗😘🤩
Cool
these men are so fit
Que bueno que existe la música de esta mujer. En un mundo de regueton.
Soo amazing dual ❤❤🎉🎉
Queen
Omg she is the best

This sounds very similar to everything else she has done, hope there’s a new sound on the horizon
Dua Lipa > Taylor Swift
Sehr gut gelungen 👍💯👌👏👏👏😻🌹🌹🌹
Bad.
❤
I love your lips lipa😂
Que humilde es Dua, haciendo que todos se peleen por ella en una cafeteria.  Simplemente humilde 😔.
Dua doesn't have any bad songs
I can't wait for the album
Simplemente Magnífica
Putin. He is a murderer. Wake up and stop nodding your heads.
wow😍😍
ok, but i love the video.
Go queen
Very bed .  I don ' t like ıt .
Wait for it to be on #1 Billboard hot 100
I'm out of Starvation 😊
Ignorandolos a todos pa estar conmigo 🥱🥰
To the lyrics, to the content: okay but how about a little humility. You're all about "what I need. "
Dua Lipa never disappoint us!
¡Wow!
She's back ❤❤❤
Dua I love youuuu
Ok
Dua gives Monica Belucci vibes!
Tajikistan 🇹🇯 ❤
this video is so BAD. Why Dua? it's so boring.. Please delete this shit
*Dia Lupa*
Zero relevance in pop culture.
The legend dua ❤
Damn this song better collect Brits and Grammys ❤❤❤❤❤❤
This is so unlike a Dua Lipa video. She didn’t do one dance step. I found it boring because she looks like she’s holding back all that talent and experience. Video director didn’t match the videos to the song. Tell the story, but this is still a music video.
tus letras siempre llegan a mi vida en el momento correcto, ilyy❤❤❤❤❤❤
The entire third world outside that window. They all look homeless. Yuck!
Give her, her 10s.
Dua Lipa always shines 😍
quite boring song, not catchy.... the video is also somithing strange. Before the songs were much better
Brilliant & infectious!!!
Angel❤
JLo did it first in Papi video, but you’re too blind to accept it
Cristianooooo
❤❤
kind of reminds me JLO's music video for Papi
Woow,  lo hace d nuevo 😍
She is easily one of the most underrated female artists of our time. Love her 💕
This sounds like a mix : Abba , Michael Jackson and Kylie Minogue. I love u so much Dua!❤ Thanks for saving Pop music ❤
.
DUAHHHLI POP 💘🎶🎶🎶
picture better than music. modernity
This is actually a very good video clip. Several last one were unfortunately quite bad (Houdini, Love again). But this one is sooo good. Nice work!
Movie training day, true of..
Kinda boring
Love Dua Lipa and this song, but, this video is creepy.
I am here to give my 24 hours to learn this shit ❤
Música ruim
Roy Andersson vibes
Another hit🎉❤
Training season over ❤❤❤❤❤
I love when popstars enter their red hair era
She surpasses herself in every era and will never disappoint us, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE ALBUM!!!
Lyrics  🥰  Are you (are you) Someone that I can give my heart to? (Heart to) Or just the poison that I'm drawn to?

Kevin Parker (tame impala) is a god 👽 Producer and writer of this song 🎧
She looks like the dui neighbor
Nice jaw and Adam’s apple
dua yes
3:32 Sufi whirling?
It's a great song, but such a boring video. I guess there are fewer and fewer interesting videos in general because the views are not as high as they used to be
from Houdini to Training season😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
WHOA, WOW! WITH THIS AND HOUDINI, YOU REACHED SEQUOIA HEIGHTS. INCREDIBLE!
this song has been on repeat the whole day
Heheh, nice, Dua Lipa ( n 3 n )
ATEEE
The movie isnt a REMAKE. Its based off a newer play version...

A beautiful singer with a good voice.
This song itched the musician worm in my brain ❤❤❤ WE BRINGING BACK GOOD MUSICCCC

Me siento reflejada en la letra de esta canción. Me cansé de darlo todo e intentar que me amen sin tener que lidiar con los traumas emocionales de el otro. Estoy en una etapa en que, como el video, me da igual quienes me vean o pretendan. 🎉❤
,🎁🙋
Me encanta esta canción y dua lipa se ve muy hermosa aquí
it's so the best music in the world❤
Bad song and video clip 👎
I LOVE HER!!! JUST LOVEEEE IT
First song of Dua that I didn’t like😢
Dua is on her own and still slaying as she ever did.
Love it...sound very Madsion Beer but somehow very Dua
Not seeing anyone compliment the concept and artistry of the music video. So I will. Cause every single shot portrayed exactly what it feels like to date in 2024.
Gorgeous ❤
Dua ❤
visually SO COOL great song
Woooow extraordinary,  very different from everything that you have done up to now ( sarcastic)
"Training Season"  Are you Someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair Is that a compass in your nature?

Dua never disappoints us. Each time the music gets better and the quality of the videos surpasses itself.
Song is great, views are less as there’s less of a performance in this video she’s literally just sitting on a table singing. Her Grammy performance was insane so compared to that this is a bit boring but still  great song.
❤❤❤
Dua Lipa Ate and left ni crumbs ❤
Very good Dua Lipa😃👌✌️❤️
SHE IS TAKING OVAAAA ❤❤
Dua Lipa reina amo tu canción ❤❤❤❤
Damn it Dua! I can’t listen to just one song all day but I’m gonna be listening to this and trying not to randomly dance in public for years
Dua 🥰🥰
No falta mucho tiempo para que sea la Queen Pop, bye Maddona
"Sit back down" Dua: I'm sat...

Dua Lipa is honestly a Goddess, she is such an icon in the pop world!! the AMS99W move is saving us mark my words

NOW THIS IS WHAT U CALL A POPSTAR!! SLAYY PLUS HER RED HAIR LOOKS SOO GOOD ON HER
REGARDS. THERE IS NO GOD EXCEPT ALLAH. MUHAMMAD WAS ALLAH'S APOSTLE. ENTER ISLAM. MUST KNOW THE MEANING OF THE AL-QUR, AN. EVERYTHING AND UNDERSTAND GOD'S WORD. WE WILL DIE......
The queen of jerks
Ok she slayed

She never disappoint with her music❤
SHE DIDN’T JUST ATE THE WHOLE MENU, SHE DEVOURED THE WHOLE RESTAURANT. PREACH! YOU’RE MAKING OUR LIVES BETTER, DUA! 🤍
I mean, the song is really awesome, so is Houdini... But girl what are those visuals? Are you in cost cutting? Houdini was one thing but now I started to worry..
I love thisssss
The lyrics are like my thoughts. How'd that happen? 💯♥️
Dua LIPA ❤❤❤❤❤
Excellent song...🎵
Dua lipa should make super bowl halftime show

Wow, Im impressed yet again 🫶I love that brain and attitude seeps through

For real, the song is phenomenal but I got dizzy after listening to it for 4 hours straight.
👎🏻 disappointed with this one, boring and rushed single this time
too much autotune this is amazing but over usage is not great her natural voice is way better
Trash Why is this recommended to me
No one does it Better than Dula Peep herself👑
BOP

If you want Dua Lipa’s hair colour Ruby Glaze by Schwarzkopf Live colour XXL
My queen
this clip disturbs me so much! A girl's nightmare... Dua Lipa rocks again!
Dua said its bye to nonchalant emotionally unavailable men cuz theyre not competing with other men anymore but a womans inner peace with themselves
Wow ❤❤
girl creating hits after hits
There's just something special to her. I can't describe it
Omg!!! So good❤🎉🎉
🙌🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥
she saved the pop music again
she never disappoints
queen
Temazo
MVの質感最高すぎる…
Dua's voice 😭😭😭💓
Training sessions lead to new skills and experiences. Spiritual ability is a training session for the eternal realm.
goo girl give us nothing
Fresh! ❤
Yo keep streaming The views are SO less  We can do better as Dua fans ❤❤❤
I like this song so much ❤ album release when?
The queen forever❤❤❤❤❤
I'd love to see her with Gaga or Katy
Fresh concept
Thank you Tame Impala. ❤
Next Britney Spears ❤
Oh i love every line of this❤
This is great training season .🤩
I’ve seen a lot of people saying that “her song is so boring and sound the same” BUT you guys will never see these kind of opinion on male artists like Justin Bieber or The Weeknd I also thought their songs also sounds exactly the same. Female artists in music industry have been making a lot of efforts to be accepted and recognized and successful. Just a penny for your thought. Ps. I LOVE TRAINING SEASON SO MUCH !!!!!
I STILL WONDER....WHY DO THEY SAY EVERY DETAIL OF THE VIDEO CLIP IN THE COMMENTS BELOW EVEN THE NAIL ARTIST AND IT DOES NOT SAY WHO WROTE THE MUSIC AND THE LYRICS OF THE SONG?  WHY THIS DISDAIN TO THE ARTISTS?
Such hot Dua looks at 0:59 isn't she? 😍😍❤
¿Y las mujeres lesbianas y bisexuales no existen? 🤔
still 🌹
Çok sıradan :( Albümde ki diğer parçaları bekliyorum bakalım.
i gotta admit, this is so much better than houdini, i'm obsessed
Aquí les dejo la traducción de esta obra de arte:  ¿Eres tú (eres tú) Alguien a quien yo pueda entregar mi corazón? (Mi corazón) ¿O eres solo el veneno que me atrae? (Me atrae) Puede ser difícil distinguir la diferencia tarde en la noche  Jugar limpio (jugar limpio) ¿Es una brújula en tu naturaleza? (Brújula en tu naturaleza) ¿O eres tramposo? Porque ya he pasado por eso antes (he pasado por eso) Y, cariño, no necesito aprender mi lección dos veces (aprender mi lección dos veces)  Pero si realmente quieres ir más allá Deberías saber que yo  Necesito a alguien que me abrace fuerte Más profundo de lo que jamás he conocido Cuyo amor se parezca a un rodeo Que sepa exactamente cómo tomar el control Cuando yo esté vulnerable Que él hable directamente a mi alma Conversaciones excesivas Que me haga sentir vértigo  ¿Eres tú alguien que puede ir más allá?

Dua always release a nice song just sayin. And i love how she stays to her music colors
Lyrics:  Are you (are you) Someone that I can give my heart to? (Heart to) Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? (Drawn to) It can be hard to tell the difference late at night  Play fair (play fair) Is that a compass in your nature? (Compass in your nature) Or are you tricky? 'Cause I've been there (been there) And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice (learn my lesson twice)  But if you really wanna go there You should know I  Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo  Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (Training season's over)  I tried (I tried) To see my lovers in a good light (good light) Don't wanna do it just to be nice (be nice) Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right  I hope (I hope) It hits me like an arrow (arrow) Someone with some potential (potential) Is it too much to ask for?  Who understands I  Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo  Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over  Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team Or stuck on the sidelines Waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go  You should know I  Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul (if that ain't you, then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload  'Cause training season's over 'Cause training season's over Training season's over.
1:40 over  🎧🇵🇸🇪🇬
It's actually so good
Naff video... Great tune though!🦍
Dua always makes our day better with her songs 🥰🥰
Wow dua has always been killing it, but this is different..LOVE it!!! 💘
So few views 😢This great song can't be a flop
cool
Let's be honest dua lipa has never launched a bad song
This gives super bowls halftime show vibe💜
More girls, less men.
She amazes me, like Madonna. They keep changing the game. I love her voice, so sensual and delicious to taste. Excellent track! Jose Joyette
The world could be such a wonderful place if only we would learn to let go of our anger, bitterness, division, and hatred. If we learned to love one another and to humbly serve one another, When God made humanity, he did so that all the people of this good earth, would love one another as brothers and sisters in Christ. We have so much potential to be a force for good in the world. All we need to do is let go of our pride and love the Lord and others with an open and willing heart. Jesus died on the cross as a free gift of salvation for us; it isn't based on self-righteousness. or based on our performance, it is only by God's great mercy and sacrifice when he died on the cross, when he took our punishment for our sins. The only thing that counts as righteousness is faith in Christ and what he has done for us. “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Rejecting God's mercy will only lead to our eternal suffering and damnation. Sin is like a disease that, if left untreated, will destroy us, like cancer. Sin must be dealt with. which is why Jesus took our punishment for us; all we need to do is repent for our sins and place our faith solely in him. “It is not those who are well who need a physician, but those who are sick. I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.” Luke 5:31-32  "Dear God, please forgive me of all my sins and wash me clean. I've chosen to trust in the finished work of your son, Jesus Christ. that when he suffered and died on the cross for my sins through his blood, they were washed away, lead, and guide me on the path you have chosen for my life; lead me away from anger and hatred; teach me to love and serve others as you've loved me."  Eternal suffering is horrifying; it is forever, and once dead, there is no escaping such a fate. That's why While we live, we need to turn to God for forgiveness. ''Anyone who says they do not sin is a liar, and there isn't truth within them.  Paraphrasing 1 John 1:8   ''But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart.  Matthew 5:28  You know that wicked people will not inherit the kingdom of God. don't you? Stop deceiving yourselves! Sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals,  Corinthians 1:6-9  But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart (from our thoughts), and these things defile a man. (Make us sinful and worthy of judgment.) For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, and slander.  ''Anyone who uses divination (consulting with psychics or mediums) practices witchcraft (Wicca) or claims to be able to predict the future through signs and omens (a false prophet) or a sorcerer (one who dabbles in black magic, or any other occultic teaching) is guilty of eternal damnation in the eyes of God'' (Hell is a place of intense physical and emotional suffering  and it is forever, for all eternity, there is no escaping it after death)  The punishment for dabbling in The occult in ancient times was harsh, you'd often be put to death by stoning or even by being burned at the stake, messing with the occult is serious, it's brought entire nations to it's knees  because of God's wrath (intense anger) and it is one of the greatest sins, man can do against God, because of Israel's rebellion in sacrificing their children the false canaanite gods (baal, astaroth and moloch), they suffered immensely over the course of history, especially when they were invaded and conquered by the Babylonian Empire. Only suffering comes from the use of such practices, suffering in this life and eternal suffering in the next.  Paraphrasing  Deuteronomy 18:10-12
The video is soooooo bad. songs ok
bersyukur bisa menikmati lagu-lagu dua lipa setiap hari🤍
❤❤❤
Dua being iconic again, I m obsessed with her 90’ vibes can’t wait for her next tour 🤩
❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤
You're in my DUA'S.😉❤ But the Tattoo on your back...you know the doggy position is impossible or only with T-Shirt.😂
Beautiful voice but she’s just so plain looking. In regards to celebrity, I mean.
the way I would freak out with so many thirsty men around me
te amo
Dua lost her mojo. Dance the night, Houdini and now Training Session are the same. So generic and boring.
💯💯💯 this is too good
Song of the year, period.
Queen is serving🎉
Serving us again 😩❤️ She is changing the game
когда реально сложно встретить кого-то действительно стоящего
Maybe she needs to date a nice girl rather than trying to teach men how to date properly.   😉  (Just sayin’…)
Wish she wears brighter colour in this video to give contrast to the background... As if she is the attention among these people.
❤
Proud of you Dua 🇽🇰🇦🇱
wtf all the ugly guys on one window , dua you did something wrong there
I feel I want to be with her when she’s creating the lyrics. Such a powerful song
Kiely Williams should’ve been invited for a cameo.
Queen of Pop 🎉
This lady is pure fire 🔥 She definitely has that 80s pop vibe and I must say , her video for this song was so creative. I wish her more future success. She deserves more air play on the radio.👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🙂
This Is a beauty music❤
The sound is a masterpiece and the melodies are awesome 🇱🇾💗
I love how her voice has become smoother and softer in this song 🥰
I will be mad. If it doesn't have Dance video version.
💃💃💃💃💃
Dua lipa you are my all-time crush hope we'll meet this year😇im Drippie Yunn  23 from Kenya🇰🇪
And body else think Dua Lipa is just that bich 😍
Me watching all the boys 😂
Defenitely a banger. She, and her song
hell yeah!
The best pop song of 2024 is "Dua Lipa - Training Season." I really like it. As usual, the beat is excellently produced, and the vocals are superb. The previous single, "Houdini," underrated by many, I find very appealing for how it mysteriously unfolds from the beginning and gradually intensifies. The music flows naturally, it's wonderful music. I love it ♥
<3
🏵
Love. You.  Dua lipa 💙 💖 💕 💓 ❤️ 😍
did anybody notice the ginger tea? That is the common treatment for VERTIGO 1:34
Ecuador 🇪🇨
Another gonna hit !!! ❤
the ( challenge) tone in 3:04 is glamorous.
Dua lipa keeps going better and better in lyrics, music vedios, dancing&singing and i love women like hers who work hard on her .I salute you dua lipa💁
All those men representing a modern woman’s body count 😭😭😭
Dua lipa ❌ Shreya Ghoshal ✅
❤️‍🩹
Who is listening to this for more than ten times as I am?❤
Big fan, but she looks bored as I was. Such a dull video.
THIS SONG. is pure euphoria.
Superb!!!! This video reminds me of a memorable scene from Malena.
Good song and you are beautiful Dua.
Literally no one can beat her.......
Uff buenísima desde Colombia 🇨🇴❤❤❤❤
this album is going to be FIRE
I loke it's 90's vibe
Miss u dua ❤
Flop !!!
I find this one better than Houdini.
Hi Dua, Really Great Song! Love You!!! 😍
Dua Lipa over taylor swift fo sure.
Lipa Dupa is dope
😻😻😻😻
Ok, but can we just take a moment to appreciate that she posts her hard-worked music videos so often?
Dia is always stunning. Thank you for being queen for us😌
Nice song❤🎉
Maybe i'm the only one but the most men in the video have a ready to rape her look.  Also some visuals remind me of clips with african emigrats arriving in eu and how the look at white women and how they will do stuff to them   Cant help checking for my wallet loolking at some faces ...   A good representation of single women in Paris / London / Berlin / Barca. - not safe
So house music is the new trend!! So thrilled to see all my favourite artists create this genre of music 🎵
Boring video and song
Oh I love her redhead era 🥹❤️
these are gays RUN DUA
3:15 ❤
My favorite singer no question.
Dua lipa is soooo cute ❤
This song's one part is same to a Bengali song so same like copy

Houdini flopped hard.

Отличная Певица !!!❤😊❤
Sounds like a nice pop song.
🔥❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I guess Dua has Her Training Season over Yes with Two Marriages gone down already and “a few “ Boyfriends.😎🇫🇮
No shade to other artists, but THIS is how you make pop music. ✨💸
The last part where everybody moves and are hard to identify while dua remains easily recognizible reminds me maybe of a painting or a film scene, not sure bit very cool idea. Also Dua slaying as always, love this song
💕💕💕💕

this is straight dogshit music
Dua se siente acosada por los hombres? O se siente deseada?
Is it summer already?! ❤🔥
Genial!! Argentina presente ❤
This is the perfect theme song for Taylor and Travis!
the song it's very good, but giiirl the whole video just sitting in a coffee? pleaseeee
Dopamina pura, ❤❤❤
👏👏👏🥰🥰🥰
Dua is saving the pop music once again
Obsessed ❤
love your video , i have an exalted Venus which means I'm fussy to the point that you prefer nothing if you can't have what you want but it takes 5 mins for things to come back but  exalted venus  makes you very flirtatious but then my voice thing pulls it up,
Vaimoni ❤
I like this music video and the song is great.
This is AMAZING!! But where are the views??!! The performance of the last single and the low views for this one isn't looking good for our girl. 😢
Dua Lipa is a legend
the song is great, but the music video is kind of boring
I really love Dua Lipa so much, his songs are so beautiful and legendary 😭😭😭❤️‍🔥💋✨🫂
me encanta Dua, pero siento que con este disco no va llegar ni al 30% de iconico y exito que tuvo Futura Nostalgia
it looks like an abba song n video its crazy i love it
Ready for billboard❤❤
This is phenomenal❤❤
me habían vendido humo varias veces pero esta ocasión la recordaré por algún tiempo
OMG how did i miss this for 2 days?
She saving pop music?? Yeah
Training Season🎶❤
Offcourse she has charisma, she's a Leo.
Ive never seen so many chavs in one music video

Amei. ❤
Her best song yet. I can't.

Let's see if a particular group finds this offensive.....
I like this.
Her songs always makes me wanna dance at 3 am🕺
I was expecting a disco kinda music video but nope but THE SONG IS EVERYTHING!!!!!!❤❤❤❤
No.
MASTERPIECE
Reina del pop
No es muy parecido este video a "Papi" de JLo?

Dua is a naturally talented musician, and her music has a calming effect on troubled souls.

I like this song 🎵
Dua Lipa is back.
Firts video..i dont like
❤❤❤🎉
Yesss
Once again the Queen delivers a certified bop !  Love her and all her musics 🤩
The longer I stare at her face, the more I realize she can be a good recast for wonder woman...like for real
It's better than Ariana's song and i like the concept
Keep streaming
2.145
❤❤
Un flopazo este sencillo
The new queen on pop
Love the bet of the song when it goes "I don't need to teach ya how to love me right"😂
I just never want to see it again
The song is great but the visual is confusing, not rewatchable …
such a boring video what was she thinking
artist!
Dua Lipa is a legend ❤
Pura arte
Amazing 😮😮❤❤❤
I love how they omitted the dancing part just let it show the song's story. Let her do the choreograph in her live shows! Mahal kita Dua Lipa!
Dua salvando el Pop ❤
La idea de fondo del video me hace pensar en la forma en que ella pueda observar la forma en que es observada. En este video no sonríe, y su expresion de incomodidad es lo que suma a lo que muestra en esa emboscada de personas, que entre tantos pensamientos, como drenarlo? Tremendo video Dua Lipa ❤
Este video se llama ser mujer en una escuela tecnica
I’m just so Proud of her ♥️♥️♥️♥️  and it is just the beginning for her
Name me more hyped up and awaited song of 2024 so far,  i will wait 🧡🧡🧡
I'm sorry but u ain't beatin' Ariana U R NOT EVEN CLOSE
Due milioni di visualizzazioni in un giorno😵‍💫😲😲😲😲😯😯😯😯😯😯🤯🤯🤯🤯
The accompanying music is not doing the vocals and melody any favors. Bland.
I LIKE YOU
I love you ❤❤❤❤
I was working out dancing on this song, it was good! I just stumbled up on this song, never heard it before 😂
I like this is 4:3 , how music videos should be 👍
Finally. She ate.
I'M LITERALLY SCREAMING!! ITS FINALLY HERE, LEZZ GOOO, LOVE UU DUALIPA🫶✨️
Yazzzz Dua eat up all these men 🫢😂😘
No other girl is doing it like her. Appreciate her ❤
OMG 😳😳😳 So many horny mens in the same place ... It's scary 😅
top, dua lipa sempre é sucesso
i love this song. it’s so fun.
Another success🎉
I don't know. Its not that catchy. Yet, its interesting. Its real. And its valuable that she doesnt repeat the formula.
Such a brilliant song with give me some 90s vibes and I'm so jamming out there. 😊
🫨🔥❤️ The best vértigo ...
DEFINITIVAMENTE ESTA ERA ME ESTA ENCANTANDO
La perfección tiene nombre y apellido (Dua Lipa) 😍🎶 I love You ❤️
I feel like she was inspired by all those "indian aged men" staring at her like their life in her recent holiday visit
This song is SICK!!!!! I'M SO ADDICTED TO THAT omg
Duaaa❤❤
The tame impala production is very obvious on this. Gotta love that. I would not mind dua’s new album being kevin’s 5th studio album 😂
The guys in the vid are literally me 🫠
Impecável Dua 🇧🇷
BORED!!!! ABURRIDO!! 🙃🙃🙃🙃
Todo este álbum será una masterclass de pop tengo 0 dudas
Perfeitaaaaaaa ❤ I love you

O SELAHATTİN BENİM KIÇIMI YESİN - Tülay (Yalan Dünya) - lots of love from 🇹🇷
Dua lipa is incredible
I am a 54 y.o. raised on classic rock. I generally don't listen to pop...ever. Then I heard Dua Lipa for the first time this week and was instantly hooked. I've been listening to her all week and absolutely love her music, which is something I've never said before about a pop artist. She is next level!
Servining mother!!!!
Toxic masculinityyyy
OMG my pigeon food is better than yours
🤘🎼💯❤️‍🩹
Brazil te amaaaaa
love her so much! i feel this song to the core!!
i love dua lipa’s girl in a french cafe style
Soy de Argentina y estoy esforzándome para colaborar con esta gran artista 🇦🇷💓
the track sounds great, but the clip is not interesting from the word at all. please change the people responsible for shooting the clips so as not to lose ratings.
Te amo dua lipa ❤
The way she constantly gets better is wild
Ela fez de novo, mais uma vez , ela é incansável ❤
This is music?
me dio un poco de ansiedad el video. por tantos hombres y una sola chica ...
Чёт по неграм перебор...
Who's that guy at 0:15?
I am the Who Dua is referring to
Man, she is those rare people that red fits so well. Stunning
Another HIT!!!! ❤
Dua Lipa never disappoints! ❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️
okay but who is that dark skin man 😍
Same song over and over with dua... at least she's not naked in the video
I don't know why but I feel like this song needs to play in the Umbrella Academy TV series.
I got work out music 🎶 💪🏻🏋️‍♀️
I love Houdini and Training Season and Appreciate Dua’s new direction. What I don’t understand is the MVs, they’re just unbothered, unlike the FN era where each video was a masterpiece that made me dizzy…
Tremenda canción!!! Con mis auriculares, se escucha como si fuera de otro mundo <3 <3 <3 <3 <3
She never disappoints
The tea 👁👄👁

I really hope you'll find "The ONE" one day ... 😢🤔🤭🤠
عشق پاک
why doesn't this video have many views?
This is ART‼️‼️‼️
😎
Good music but too generic as always…
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Great vibes!! 🥳🥳🤯🤯✨✨
Dua Lipa never disappoints !
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤need someone to hold me close deeper then i ever know ive been singing the song the whole day 😂
Training season's over, but Dua's on fire this year. 🔥
I want the whole album and the TOUR!!!
Cool song !
I'm obsessed with this song I can't stop listening it You did it again, Dua
When’s your next tour in Europe?
.......... Merci
I need Dua's new album to be announced right now.
Yessssss
te amooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
New best song ever.
Dua is literally one of the greatest pop singers. Her voice making every song so enjoyable
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dua is a great artist
Noticing Danny L Harle among the co-writers. Anyone else thinking this is more similar to PC Music than other Dua songs, or am I just imagining this?
Dua driving crazy all the men is the best representation of the reality ❤
Love this Great Song and Video, youre Amazing!
Arte 🙇🏻‍♂️✨
While I listen this song, in some parts it reminds me of some ABBA's songs, such as "Gimme,gimme,gimme".
I love itttttt 🎉❤❤
LASTTTT
I can hear the doors in here with those keys 🔥
❤
(\_/) ( •. •)  />❤ 👇 . . *You’re amazing,I hope you have a great life with a lot of happiness*
Omg what’s is happen with the pop in 2024 ❤
🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I just don't get it, I'm as bored as she looks in this video. The lyrics are nothing new, the song's not catchy (which I must admit Houdini was), the video gives me anxiety. She's impressive for the way she looks and sounds when she speaks, so maybe acting instead of singing? Won't be listening again probably, but ya'll enjoy *Houdinis outta here*
NEED SOMEONE TONHOLD ME CLOSE
Director: Dua how many hoodies do you want in the intro?  Dua: Yes  It’s a very good song!
I love it’s song😭😭
La mejor 💞 de todos los tiempos dua lipa 💞
@Dua Lipa ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭
I really like your songs, kiss
Essa mulher nãocansa de ser perfeita?

“Don’t wanna teach u how to love me right” that sentence is so relatable nowadays lol. Also anyone in a room full of men would run  cute song
Valió la pena tanta espera ❤❤❤
"The best thing I've heard this February, you're incredible, you really manage to capture and convey what you want."🫀🔥

Sorry, but this girl is used up, new hits are like copy-paste. No offense :)
Dua Lipa should do the Super Bowl halftime show next year. PERIOD
This is my greatest fear.
😍😍🇦🇱🇽🇰🔥
I remember seeing her live in India right before the pandemic hit and thinking she's just amazing...but now? I can't even express how iconic her discography and presence has gotten🔥🔥
Amo 💜
TEMAZOOOOOO🔥🔥🔥🔥
Oi tudo bem?
not sure why he is not named in this but Kevin Parker(Tame Impala) produced this
ALL ads are MUTED.....I close my eyes, take a break while having a few moments of peaceful silence....and, I move the image almost out of the field of view so I avoid even having to watch it.....and, take a few relaxing deep breaths.
Love the song, it's very catchy.
✌🏽🧿🥂

Todo mundo cala a boca, a lenda tá fazendo história denovo!!
Listen, I have never been a big superfan of a female singer but..... Dam Dua is unreal. She is a phenomenal talent and recreating the 80s nostalgia perfectly.
You're so beautiful 🥰🥰😍😍 from Tunisia 🇹🇳🇹🇳
So nicee❤❤
Dua literally never disappoints
Definitely Madonna lost her crown
♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡
The whole pop industry cant compare  with you .And to think that an Albanian singer could reach so high on her career.I am proud to live in the time that Dua's music is everywhere. You are a legend
PERIODT!!!!
I feel bad for dua. Must be hard to be at such a high level with almost 0 chance for an equal mate
The bass 💥💥💥

Okey but am I the only one who hears Taylor Swift’s voice on the machine at the end 👀🤨🤯
0:51 to 0:54 is sounding like another song from the 2000's - anyone know ?
Greatttt song!
A mulher ficou sentada o clipe todo, virou buda agr dua lipa?

love loveee the song but the video stresses me out
She never miss it
THIS ONE iS BETTER THAN Ariana's Yes and &yes and remix  😂
Why go to a therapist... when dua lipa exists🎉❤
🖤”
Magnificent.
For everyone disappointed about the video, it had to be reshot as the original concept included riots, explosions and big scenes but it got scrapped due to the Gaza conflict. Training season was supposed to be the first single too.
Her music is a therapy
the girl is determined to save pop music
Make my day 🎉
What a great song 🎵 ❤
rubbish...
"Dua Lipa" é Maravilhosa Talentosa Demais❤ Amei a Música
Como pode não existir uma música ruim da Dua...
❤
Parabéns ❣
Your music always gives me wings and a lot of happiness❤🎧
I can't stop listening to this 🔥
Now the choice is to train with the elderly
Depuis le temps qu’on attendait… on est pas déçu ❤❤❤
Do you have even one song that is not an instant hit?! Love your voice and music! ❤
okay, but is there anyone who also thinks it's quite boring?
love you dua❤
The one that I want is Dua Lipa ❤
PENGEN BANGET NONTON DUA LIPA DI INDO LAGI! MAKIN CANTIK AJA INI MANUSIA 🥰😍

💓💓💓
Já é hit
Dua 🔥
I feel so lucky to meet you and see how much you are  grow! Keep rising my star 🌟
The prechorus is magical
She’s not pretty enough to pull that many men when she goes out. Im sorry ladies. I know you all think you’re tens but no.
Dua Lipa is honestly a Goddess, she is such an icon in the pop world!!
Friend please don’t forget about God in your life. If you live life with Jesus you will never loose hope. God bless you. John 3v16

I don't understand why so few views...

Jury - 3,5/10
What's with all the DEI?
This Is A Masterpiece! Bravo, Dua! With Love from Ukraine 🙏🏻💖💖💖💖💖 always be so fantastic and HAPPY!!!
❤❤❤
The song is good but the video is so boring... She could've been doing some choreo and switch up between scenes more... Idk. This is a missed opportunity
Perfeita
This MV is giving 90s vibes. Even its dimension is 3x4 which is popular in the 90s. You rock Dua
This reminded me of "Container Park" from the HANNAH's movie soundtrack
Probably te BEST bridgue off all Dua's songs
my neighbour called the council on me, for blasting this too loud
Not good as Houdini and Barbie song
Linda e super talentosa
Sensacional Adoro Esta Música Fico Feliz Por Ti És Uma Boa Cantora
Who sings the song? Where is Dua Lipa's voice?
Eu amei o clip e a musica nem se fala a melhor musica da Dua ❤
Let's be honest. Dua Lipa has NEVER released a bad song.

I’m sorry but she really ate this up , it’s safe to say she’s the new queen of pop
Wow I was waiting for this track to come out and it came out and I'm just getting high😊
Questa donna non ne sbaglia una
one word to say only :🌌 BEAUTIFUL 🌌
you rock everytime
Dua!❤
"Sausage party" could be an alternative title for the track.
unique
Our main stream media is senseless ethic less along with rising unemployment makes the migration of rural town tier 3 tier 2 cities   females & males migrate to metro cities where they act like animals those males who r sincere check the complete background of female  before getting married bcoz these days I have seen so many reports that males & females from  mostly in age 13 to 30 they just busy in taking gifts money food articles & physical intercourse only      no loyalty towards any one they change boyfrnds or partners like clothes so don't send males & females outside your area unless very necessary And get a female who as ur wife who has a character & loyalty Adultry has become a common phenomenon in India & Asia so talking about culture is waste marriage is no longer a pious thing it's just an agreement which legislature have to pass in UCC but females while making a boyfrnd live partner or getting married choose a wise prudent man not only Money & physical attraction that will lead to tarnish lives other Thing this generation have to understand the Loyalty is most important factor of Life.
Finally the ONE who can sing, doesn't show every inch of her body, can f*cking sing!❤
really good and powerful video ! chaotic male energy, i feel you! it can get violent out there with those lads, stay safe much love and thank you for your art <3
Her Grammy performance was  but this full version is
مكتوب حلب على يدها
Her voice  the melody this song  is very well produced 😍
Awesome my princess ⚜️❤️⚜️❤️⚜️❤️⚜️
Not seeing anyone compliment the concept and artistry of the music video. So I will. Cause every single shot portrayed exactly what it feels like to date in 2024.
Que buena cancion!!

This is a solid song. Absolutely talented woman. That being said it might not do well since it's not generic manufactured
slayed as always
❤❤❤
Now this is a good song❤
Why is there so many videos when woman sit or lie the whole time. Its superstrange. Cool song. Unfortunate video
Omg baby
I love those gothic synths. Such a vibe ❤ Also, so many beautiful boy I see here.
Wow, Dua Lipa just spoke the heart of so many women. But honestly, I think what we want only comes in a long-term committed relationship and learning from each other.
Dua Lipa
Queen ❤❤❤❤

Nice song, also Dua's red hair fits so good on her 💃🏻✌️
Let’s go Dua
That’s girl
No matter what genre you are listening to on a daily basis, pop, rock, rap, electro or whatever, this song really hits you. And that's the beauty of Dua Lipa.
I love you Dua
Omg
The song is perfection. It's a little bit "Future Nostalgia", a bit ABBA, a bit "Cupid Boy", a bit Boney M. The gays on Popjustice are all slating the video but, I think it's so effective; it almost gave ME vertigo!  Plus the ph-ph-ph-physical singles are all coloured red like Dua's hair. Lovely touch. This is hitting harder than the last 2 songs from this era.  Well done, everyone.  10/10. ❤❤
Love ❤❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 DUA LIPA 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
❤🎉❤🎉❤супер
What a present to be alive just for listening Dua Lipa's new tunes! 🎉
Dua siempre maravillosa espectacular muy bueno
auuuuu
The one and only queen
La música de dua lipa me encanta, y la mayoría dice que este álbum no triunfará pero yo se que si❤❤❤❤
It is pretty clear that clip is to make 'him' jealous. Showing yourself around men who are eager to do everything for you:)
Thanks for upload this to Russia
Her face 😈 expressions are  pretty devil sumeure.
I feel like the casting call for this music vid was: "Looking for Fuck boys aged 18-25"
Aí mona, desculpa, mas que clipe chato
so fucking boring
Eastern european aesthetic ❤
She is back to save pop music
Amoooo 🤍✨🤍✨🤍✨
The only unrealistic part of this video is that it's just men going crazy over her but in reality it's women too
The Queen of PoP❗ ❤✌🏻🙌
This girl always slays, she is a Queen👸👑
Aaaaa DUA lipaaaa The best in the world, I am from Spain and I admire you very much.🫶🏻💎
Every song from Dua Lipa is an instant hit 🔥❤
Solo puedo pensar en cuando vino a Buenos Aires y todos los fanáticos estaban pegados al vidrio en el preferido jajaja
The extended version is 🔥  You can hear the psychedelic influences
❤from KARBI ANGLONG
This is my favorite song from her.
With its captivating voice, Dua Lipa music goes beyond the ordinary, touching hearts and nourishing souls with its unmatched beauty and emotion. ❤
Leer qué sabe cantar 🎤 desde los 8 años y preguntarse porque empezó tarde a cantar valió la pena 🙁 por su gran voz
she needs to go back to the drawing board. this era ain't it.
Dua lipa ojalá algún día vengas a Ecuador 🇪🇨
She just can’t flop like even if she tried she wouldn’t

Dua nunca falla pinche rola maravillosa 🔥

خرب يومج شكد هوت
Finally some original music from DL, her last songs were all too samey and stale. That being said, the MV is boring and uninspired.

Dua never disappoints us. Each time the music gets better and the quality of the videos surpasses itself.

[Verse 1] Are you Someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair Is that a compass in your nature?

dua and ari are saving the pop music this year✨💗
Okay internet sleuths, who is that man at the 30 second mark, lol. Inquiring minds want to know.
Listen, I have never been a big superfan of a female singer but..... Dam Dua is unreal. She is a phenomenal talent and recreating the 80s nostalgia perfectly.
eu escutando duas mil vezes a live no grammy até ela lançar a gravada
im done  i feel completed
The song is super catchy, she is very beautiful but the video is a bit poor
❤❤❤❤❤ I LOVE
I thought it would be an MV with choreography...
Wonderful Music and Wonderful Style ever!❤❤❤❤😍
Song is perfection but this music video was a huge let down 😐
I dyed my hair the same colour just because she wears it
A mesma coisa

Aburrido

❤❤❤❤I love you dualipa you are the best we love your songs
A very early 90s take of both pop and a little bit of disco. I think, it has been her trade mark but this one is just electrifying! What a vibe ✨
❤❤❤
Dua Lipa definitely did it again she is always amazing with her type of music and lyrics she feels good with, this woman definitely doesn't make bad songs at all, keep it up Dua you definitely are the very epicenter of the Pop music and industry your my one and only favorite i love to listen and look upon to.💞💞💞
Dua perfect ❤🤩
This video is how Tinder and Bumble look like when a woman creates a profile there xD
Her music can heal ❤
Queen ❤❤😍
Deal with the devil full on
As soon as the music starts, I'm overcome with an irresistible urge to dance joyfully, swaying to the rhythm as if each note is whispering to me, inviting me to let go and embrace the moment.
The art it's winning this year. Thanks Dua Lipa, Ariana and Belinda 🥰🥰🥰
Trash Videos 😂 Trash Songs 😂😂

DuART Lipa
Love it... But I love Houdini more
Powerful performance of training season & Houdini at the Grammys. The vocals are so good, it’s perfection! 🎉👏  The vibe of this video is a wonderful expression, really the training season’s over! Love the lyrics really much! ❤🫶
Legend dua lipa❤❤❤
With such a great voice. She is definitely the best pop artist. Love her but does everything have to be about relationships.... Would be wonderful to get some deep tunes with her talent. That’s Pop Music I guess. She’s the best at it for sure.
Dua thank you we love you with all of our hearts ❤❤❤
I love this song! I can totally relate! Dua is my favorite artist! Her music is awesome 😂
This woman knows how to make a hit!
Literally  Kur Ni femen Pin kafe ne nje fshat 😂😂😂
I LOOOOOVE !!!! Congratulations, Dua !!
Dual Lipa needs to play wonder woman. New movie yall!!!
So cool🔥🔥🔥
❤❤❤
Love you Dua
Dua debería cambiar y arriesgarse a otro género, la amo pero estas canciones ya son más de lo mismo. 😢
Dua Lipa  mi amigo es súper fan tuyo! Me hace ver tus canciones cada vez que sale una nueva xd
Very different from the other ❤
Dua said: I’m just gonna sit here and make history
I lovee this!!
The song is amazing and the music video Is beautiful ❤.
Let's gooooo🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️🏃‍♀️
I have mixed feelings. Houdini already had a weak hook and this does too.
The song is so catchy and it sounds like 2000s pop music i love the melody ,her voice ,the video clip 0 nudity and so relatable with the song i just love it .we havent heard such songs for so long .like the comment if u agree

the chorus reminds me of the song "Tokyo Nights" by digital farm animals
So much more talent than the rest of them. So good!
slayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Queen
did she sample abba song "lay your love..." before the first bridge?
Duaaaa❤
she licked the plate clean with this one fr
If Britney wanted to work on this as a collob would be dreamy !!!
DUA IS THE MOMENT
это как подарок от Дуа Липы, потому что сегодня мой день рождения 🎇  Спасибо за твоё творчество Дуа Липа💓

The intro , the chorus wow , the bridge is amazing gurl .... My new favourite
When a woman knows what she brings to the table🔥
Director: How many celebrities do you like?  Dua: YES!

😍
🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟   🎋🇫🇷 🤩😎🤙
Somehow this video reminds me of the feeling of scrolling through profiles after profiles in Bumble and wonder which of these men is going to break my heart again 🙂
Dua 🫶🏻🥺💕💕
Omg I love this song !!!!! Its so true what she said ... now days you have to training  guys to how to treat you and love you ...
this song is addictive
We dont need them damn boys. We need a MAN. Amen  Basically what she said right?
Кажется Дуа Липа вдохновилась клипами Ольги Серябкиной🤔 или это совпадение)
Dua Lipa es arte puro...😮😍😍😍
ILY
A literal siren 🧜🏻‍♀️💘
Agora sim dona Dua Lipa, a gente começa a era com essa aqui e fingi que nunca existiu Houdini!
❤❤
Obsessed! ❤️‍🔥
Dua Lipa is a respected artist
Iiiilooooove it 🔥✨
I kept waiting for her to dance 😭
What an addictive chorus
Love Dua Lipa 🇵🇪
I don't know but I am really interested in her third album, her red hair era
Extraordinary is an understatement ✨🫶🏻✨🤍✨😉✨🙃✨🌱✨🪐✨🤞🏼✨
MI AMOR, TE AMO GRACIAS POR TANTO ARTE🤩🤩🤩

wtf is that Dua😩😩😩
The video has me still confused on this woman's type n I'm not mad about it.
Dua Lipa never disappoints in her songs, never stop, it's going well
Dua Lipa save Pop industry again.
BANGER
Her music is a therapy 😌
What a magical connection between Dua and Kevin Parker (Tame Impala)! ✨ A dream come true.
01:00 it’s Art fantastic shot wow and the movement ❤
The rhythm love it✨
💯💙
Girl is on fire 🔥🔥🔥 this is really good
Dua making perfect songs again. It's my new favourite song!! ❤❤
Why this song isn't going viral😒I think performing it on Grammys has reduced its charm😢anyways dua lipa is as usual iconic and ❄
ERES PERFECTA DUA! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻⭐
❤❤❤
I still can't believe I heard this work of art
I found the video in 4:3 format interesting. It matches the proposal of the "vintage" sound that is coming. Not to mention the CRT monitor that appears on the wall bracket, which is sensational.
I ❤❤❤❤❤

Wow Dua, your music gets better and better! Honestly you’re an icon! Literally can’t stop listen to it!😍❤
Wow amazing Dup Lipa I Love The whole music video of Training season your killing it 🔥🔥🔥🔥😲😱❤️❤️❤️
Dua Lipa never disappoints! She always enchants ❤️😍❤️😍❤️
Do you remember when Dua Lipa published her number after she broke up with her boyfriend? I think now this is where the idea for the clip came from.
Dua va esta haciendo historia y lo sabes 😉

Deusa!
It's such a catchy and empowering song. The lyrics and the beat are so energetic. I think it's another great addition to Dua Lipa's repertoire.
Dua eres fantástica
Rolonnnnnn❤
It's so good sounds but the video, I'm feeling anxiety every second. Who thinks that it is a good idea 😅
Dua Lipa, the queen of pop music ! 💯🥰

DUA QUEEN OF POP!!!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 GO DUA!!!!
Thnx Kevin Parker!
Słaby singiel w porównaniu do „Houdini” .
This is the best female empowerment an artist can do with his/her songs!!! She really changed the game with her lyrics from day 1!
Lol woke up tired as hell see the new song and started listening instantly started dancing. She is amazing one hit after another.
I love how they omitted the dancing part just let it show the song's story. Let her do the choreograph in her live shows! Mahal kita Dua Lipa!
niii duaaaaaaaa!!!
She released a memorable song again. Basically, you don't get tired of listening to her songs many times, on the contrary, it recharges you.
Pop τραγουδι με αρχή μέση και τέλος 😊 🫶
Dua lipa back to save the music industry
THIS HITS SO HARD RN
Why am i feeling this is version 1 of the MV…
Love your music.❤❤
Minutes 0:44 Hojlund 😅😅
Is there something she can’t do!? She so perfect
This music video got me a bit NERVOUS.. Its a bit triggering. I was all the time fearing something would happen to her like a gang r. or something. But precisely because of that, the video is very good. Very good indeed!
This gotta be one of the best songs dua has ever made, pop perfection
The Queen has come back
Dua slays!!!!!
🔥✨🐰✨🔥
love this! can't wait for the new album
The outfit choice was terrible
SHE'S SO PERFECT😍
Is this meant to be a representation of all the men she’s gone thru cus
very insane! ❤️‍🔥
Look like it was filmed at the calais camp 😮
The luckiest Candy Glaze Nº4
I love the concept of the video so much, it's really really clever and deep, plus the song slaps you in the face!!! ✨ Queen Dua
wow
✌🧡
Wtf did I just watch? Terrible. What happened to pop videos being bold, colourful, good choreography and some sparkle. This is flat, dull, boring and overcompensating.
finally it's out!!! Dua just keeps getting better and better with each new song!!!

agradecido de kevin parker🙌
the song is nice, but the topics are always the same, it's getting pretty repetitive at this point, she should stop to play the part of the girl mistreated by "bad" men because she deserves more

YESSSSSSSSSSSSS
irl more gays and girlies will swarm over dua🎉 issabop
Godess of the universe, she does not revolve around the sun but the sun asks for pemission to orbit her presence. all cvntries recognize her has their queen and may trade under her 6 inch stilettos. She doesn't run the motherboard in space but her attendants serve her under her serving protocols. She's hung and you will gag and have your Wig eject into outer space. The house acknowledges her PhD in huntyology and vows at the minimal glare she dares to serve. She could not eat more as she left no crums left when she was born by the grace of god herself who bestowed onto her the power to slay. You've been blessed.
Lyrics of this song on my channel ! Check out and enjoy ♥
Do I really hear that ABBA piano tune somewhere at the end of Training season?  FAB , Dua Lipa!!!
Another incredible tune and video. Such a megastar.
I've been following Dua music since some of her most popular songs (Physical, Don't Start Now, Levitating, Break My Heart), but now it's like I can't stop to listen what she does, cause each new song is another masterpiece to hear. Seriously, this young artist is brightning currently into the pop music.
quiso interpretar a la Nanu, mujer disque de "alto valor", terminó su temporada de entrenamiento y yá sabe lo que quere XD
Houdini was mid, lack of material, Training Season is the level up, this is bop
You wear our colours proudly 🇦🇱⚫🔴

Por que la gente no está bailando? Todos deberían estar bailando
Dua is something
Reminding me of the passsssst
Good tune. I’ve loved Dua for so long. Wish she would write a tune about a woman who doesn’t need a man and love and something deeper. That would be phenomenal. Great voice and vibe nonetheless as always ❤ She’s definitely saved the Pop scene.
This is so fire.i love her look She's so beautiful
❤
Ya llegue en un punto en que amo todo lo que hace ♥

If you are reading this "I give you my happiness for a day" I hope you enjoy it wisely
*Dua Lipa - Training Season | Lyrics*  Are you (Are you) Someone that I can give my heart to? (Heart to) Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? (Drawn to) It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair (Play fair) Is that a compass in your nature? (Compass in your nature) Or are you tricky 'cause I've been there? (Been there) And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice (Learn my lesson twice)  But if you really wanna go there You should know I  Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo  Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (Training season's over)  I tried (I tried) To see my lovers in a good light (Good light) Don't wanna do it just to be nice (Be nice) Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope (I hope) It hits me like an arrow (Arrow) Someone with some potential (Potential) Is it too much to ask for?  Who understands I  Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo  Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over  Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team or stuck on the sidelines Waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go  You should know I  Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload  'Cause training season's over 'Cause training season's over Training season's over
This bridge is soo DL1 coded and I’m HERE FOR IT !!

Kinga
It was about damn time!!!
Parabéns dua ❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
So good 👍  And about lyrics.. i think Dua shows the press around her and she needs someone who to stay with her closer and deeper than her famous figure. Well, maybe i am wrong :V  The true is the song is very good 👍👍
I’m OBSESSED
❤
dua drops another song  h&m: "this is free real estate"
Chorus 10/1000 I was really looking forward to it, but Im a little disappointed. I liked it better on live, because her voice was deeper. Here it's so kiddy. 😢
Love again vibes 😍😍😍
Dua Lipa got me through the pandemic with a smile on my face. Luv this woman. 😍🤩 Keep singing Dua.

It is a great song that I am addicted to singing and enjoy it you are better
Loved it😮‍💨❤️❤️❤️❤️
DULA PEEP IS SO STRONG.  How should it feel to carry all the weight of pop on your shoulders?
❤️🇦🇱❤️🇦🇱❤️🇦🇱💋🇦🇱💋🇦🇱
I AM SUPER DUPER GROOVING TO THIS! IT HITS ALL THE NERVES AND GUTS!!
I love you Dua
Dua this song is divine. It is the most direct hint you can give to another person. It's magic ❤
🔥
I like how energetic but ominous the song sounds 🔥
❤️🌀🏁
The way she constantly gets better is wild
Cada vez amo más a esta mujer❤️
Sounds like peak Kylie. In a good way.
Love itttt duaaaaa
Тревожный клип…..
Dua Lipa is soooo hot! One more perfect hit! 😈
This music is thousands times  better than Houdini.  The live version presented at Grammys was insane and energetic.  It will work so good in her show.
👍
Dua que sorte em,cheios dos contatinhos😂
the song is so good and deserved a better mv tbh. somethig like her performance at the awards...
YESSSS 😫💙
She’s always on point. Hot and unbothered babyyy 🔥🔥🔥
She did it AGAIN! she never disappoint us❤
She’s so fu***** hot
Does anyone else think that the intro and outro of the music video should have been included in the song too?
❤❤❤❤❤
Nice, but it seemed better in the Grammy performance
😍😍
Dua
Lesgooooo 🔥🔥🔥
Amazing like always!! ❤🎉
😍😍😍😍
We love dua  lipa

Love the bridge 💞💞
Song is good video is kind of disappointing where’s the dancing this is a upbeat dance pop song
I am leaving this comment here! Whenever some one likes my comment i will come back to listen to this masterpiece again!❤
Video somehow reminded me about "De Staat - Witch Doctor" :)
Dua Lipa sin duda salvaste el 2024, eres única, loves por siempre, Dua por siempre.
❤❤❤
não costumo ouvir mt ela , mas gostei bastante dessa.
Música --- 1000/1000🏆🏁❤️  Vídeoclip - 1/10 🙄👎
Dua acaba de salvar este año de mierda
OMG Duaaaaaaa you steal my  heart with your expressions, loving the expression and the look  ❤❤❤❤
I didn't like this version, there's no melody, I prefer it more danceable, in the same way as the 2024 Grammy presentation
Boring as hell
It's a music video without dancing, but the lyrics are delivered so well  Goodjob Dua!
I'm in love with someone 🫠
Me encantaaa
Bruhhhhhhh
Dua Lipa DUA LIPA  2024
Love this song and love Dua Lipa ❤❤❤❤!!!! 🤩 🎉
This gotta be one of the best songs dua has ever made, pop perfection
Dua Lipa one more time saving the music industry.... and my heart
God finally it's here 💗
The prechorus is magical👌
Me encanta esta canción. .  .  .
i. Guay. !
She can do wherever with all men! 🤩😍
Slayyyyyy girl
Drink and one Greek coffee Loumidi
Why all the men in this video look dangerous? I don'r get the meaning of this video, although the song is good.
A música é incrível, mas o clipe é muito fraco , o clipe de Houdini foi melhor.  Amei q Musica🎉🤸🏽‍♀️🏁❤
I love u so much, thanks for this song, I really need learn.
Chokbar ❤
❤❤❤
Γειά μας
I love you so much dualipa ♥️❤♥️
I love you so much 💓❤😘❤
The chorus is even more "earworm" to me than in the previous hit, I like the pre-chorus, and am not sure if I heard that pre-chorus for the first time, or, if it took me like three times listening  befor it  gained the right to please me. This might become a big success. Maybe because there is a daring contrast in complexity and demand on the listener between pre-chorus (I love) and chorus (I cannot but like).
It's such a BOP!!!! That bridge is insaaaaaaaaaaane 😍
Te amamos Dua Lipa ❤
DUA NEVER DISAPPOINTS!!! CANNOT WAIT TO HEAR THE FULL ALBUM <3
Don't know why it reminds me of Talking to Yourself by Carly Rae Jepsen and I love it 🖤
Wow, I like the vibe. Smth mysterious✨ Gorgeous Dua.
Hottest woman alive!! and this song is a bop!
She forget the verse “training season with the other, with me no”
every song you release girl is a smash!!!!
You only have bops ❤
Bu Tülayın Zerrinle oturduğu kafe değil mi ya. Zerrin nerde?
I love how they omitted the dancing part just let it show the song's story. Let her do the choreograph in her live shows! Mahal kita Dua Lipa!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Music😍 Video😦😦boring
already a Timeless Masterpiece ❤

I love
This is such a well written song and the theme of the song is so relatable and effectively communicated by the lyrics and music video visuals.
Thank you Dua for saving us ❤
Como está lindo o clipe e a mensagem de empoderamento que quer passar.
Your musics the reason i pass in my exams tbh 🫶🏻
Hey Dua, can you make a song about the Mughal Empire, Indian fans will be happy a lot!! Maybe about Babur founding, Humayun losing it, Akbar expanding it, Jahangir doing nothing, Shah Jahan building the Taj Mahal, and Aurangzeb/Alamgir starting the decline of the empire, and in the end add some references to what Azam Shah, Bahadur Shah, Jahandar Shah, Farrukhsiyar(start of Sayyid Brothers), Rafi-ud-Darajat, Shah Jahan ii, Muhammed Shah, Ahmed Shah Bahadur(end of Sayyid brothers), Alamgir 2, Shah Jahan iii and iv, Shah Alam ii, (Battle of Plassey, Battle of Buxar)Akbar ii did to decrease the empire and how Bahadur Shah Zafar ended the empire because of the revolt of 1857.
❤️🔥❤️🔥❤️☺️
Well that's a hit.
❤❤❤❤LIVERPOOL FANS
this sound so goood
I just wanna say that I love every song of you Dua 😘😘😘
A MELHOR, A MAIOR Q TEMOS
How beautiful she is and how men harass her about how they HAVE TO CHOOSE THEM. And yes she does look a LOT like a "Goddess" and a flash of "God" to me. This is the exact prescription. The man who does this: check how his body and face and physique and lifestyle align with a telepathic "new humanity" that can sense the emotion of hiding things and deception and vulgar things being FRUIT on a tree. If the flower is the genital? Generates? More of the species? With it's parts? Has a "vulva" shape, and a "phallic" shape?!?!??? So a GODDESS AND GODESS? IS THIS A DEBATE? THAT IS WHAT THEY WOULD RATHER DO. CRITICIZE A HUMAN FOR POINTING OUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT, FOCUS ON ANY "COLLOQUIAL" "MISTAKE" AND MANIPULATE THEM TO THINK THEY WILL BE MURDERED. SOUND LIKE ANY HYPOCRISY ENFORCER WE USE TO KNOW??? JESUS CHRIST DIDN'T CALL OUT HYPOCRISY??!
ESO PATRONAAA!!
wow you got some music out there I never thought it could go this way
Anyone in 2034??✅
Amazing i love it
Thanks for 0 Like 👍✅
Love from India 🇮🇳✅

Meu Deus que preguiça de fazer um clipe bom... custava ela levantar dessa cadeira ?
Oh, men...

Como estava ancioso e ela entregou tudo ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Hermosa, te amo.
It's a BOP
Divaaaaaa❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Truly loving the aesthetic of this era so far. Can't wait for the album. 🔥
First thing from Dua,that I dont like.Including video full of weird faces of criminal looking men..
Another master piece ✨️
I can tell they got inspired by the movie Malena with Monica Belucci
I can't believe it a video where she actually has clothes on
Dua is the best ❤
Duaa❤❤❤❤
🇧🇦🇦🇱❤️
I've listened to this already 7 times
Queen
Ей такой цвет волос не идёт

Is it just me or does the final version not have that excitement than the audio when it was being promoted
❤❤❤
Perfect ❤
❤❤❤ This is so
THIS IS FIREEE ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥, TRAINING SEASON IS OVER, BUT THIS NOT!
Disappointing once again. Can't top the "Future Nostalgia" vibes.

What shit is this 😮
dope
THE BEST AMK
Love from India 🇮🇳 Dua 🥂🔥🖤🧿🌼
❤️❤️❤️
Bravo, ova devojka nema lošu pesmu definitivno. ❤️
divou musa te amo
Horrible song Dua. You misled us with photos of gymnastics and hyped us up even more with the Grammys. If you hadn't hyped us with the shorts, performance, and clips, we wouldn't expect this, and you probably would have had more views. You are showing in this song that you are tired of famous and fans coming to you, because of your arrogance and proudness that will probably be a dream now. You did the same thing for Houdini but that was a good song.
Dua Lipa looks tired but still so beautiful. Must be so busy with everything. Please have some rest, love❤.
The camerawork is amazing 😍 the colors, the action, the shots 🔥
Great work Dua Lipa
Premier clip où elle ne montre pas son corps 😮😮😮
If u ask me which dua should pick, himmmm 0:43
Love the concept
The queen of pop is backkkk
Another great new song!! Ans she's very hot with her new red hairstyle too!! I love Dua Lipa!! Who else loves her? +1
So good❤
Absolute pop Masterpiece
"Why am I surrounded by uggo mystery meat non-Whites, and where's all the White boys at?" *sips cuppa*
When is the album out
DEVOURED
Une tuerie.
❤️‍🔥
Who is here after Grammy 😊
Love the song but to be honest I find Dua's voice sounds overprocessed during the verses
2024 gang👇🏼
Am I the only one who feels some Malena vibes?   Love this song so much
werk.
Mabuhay Dua                 from Philippines
This woman is unstoppable with golden upcoming album 🩵🫡
Tooo high
She can not make a smash video
The fact that she makes our lives better and better every time she releases a single😍🔥❤️
Waiting for DL3
SLAY QUEEN
Omg this is so good,iconic,modern,creative I’m in love 🤍🤍🤍✨
❤❤❤❤
me gusta dua lipa pero esta canción la veo muy repetitiva, es la misma melodía desde el inicio. no me atrapa. se escucha muy pop estándar, como lo fue Houdini. no tiene un coro que me atrape o capture para repetirla. cuestión de gustos. a lo mejor pega, pero no se. sorry, not sorry. el video tambien es estandar creo yo, no se si es el color, la forma. todo encerrado en el mismo cuarto. es muy repetitivo también.
The boys all going to the Men's room💀💀💀
I love youuuuu
A real pop star ⭐️
Duaaaaa SLAAAAYYYYYY
diva demaiss
that café could be frightening fr
Pop stars really do think the world spins around them :)
In her every song, she's asking for someone to take control. Fifty Shades of Dua !!!😉😉😉
My superstar ❤
❤❤❤❤❤😂
We finally got the official Training Season music video from a pop queen who saved pop music again
I love how they omitted the dancing part just let it show the song's story. Let her do the choreograph in her live shows! Mahal kita Dua Lipa!
Increíble dua, nunca decepcionas. 🎉❤
لا داعي إنّما هي رموز لا تحملها ابحث عن رموزك بدل إضاعة الوقت على اتباع خطواتي
Who loves dua lipa ❤
❤❤
The hand tattoo حب 😍
You can see many swiftes but not lipa's bc they are very different ❤
La mejor representante del la música Pop en estos tiempos ¡Viva Dua!

2024.01.16
Dull video dull song
“Don’t wanna teach u how to love me right” that sentence is so relatable nowadays lol. Also anyone in a room full of men would run 😂 cute song
Dua wtf can’t get this song out of my head
woman ultimate desire
Yh this is a hit
Hiç bıkmadan usanmadan tekrar tekrar dinliyorum🎧🫠
Total sausage-fest.
God save the Queen
Finally ❤
She’s back 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Dua in leather is fire!!!
The difference between Dua and the majority of her contemporaries is the extremely high level of production that goes into every element of everything she releases. She never settles for mediocre.
Super 🎉🎉🎉❤❤❤
Ok, didn’t think it was possible but new favorite dua song!
Beautiful as always:)🎉🎉🎉
Dula Peep, banger as always
I think I love this song
...💖💖💖...👅
Dua is doing the most with this music vid, all while ironically being sat down! OBSESSED with the drama darling! ❤
Holaa Dua Lipa doesn't realize it, but she is making everyone's lives better with her music 🔥🔥
Amazing song / video ❤🔥🔥

Lovely ✨️🧡
The new queen of the pop 👑
Love love love. Incredible artwork. You look stunning
When is this album out?
Funny how she made it like a 90's video, I love it, it makes me nostalgic of my childhood, early teen years^^
Looks like 90s labour market
0:59 2:09 3:09 ☝️🇧🇩🔥🇧🇩🔥☝️
Wow hearing this with good headphones sounds amazing great dance song Dua uare Amazing Sweetheart ❤🎵 🎶 🎵
ПРЕКРАСНО!
Shes gorgeous.
I expected this to sound so much better, it did in Grammy performance and in snippet. Those knocking sounds, song arrangement and auto tune on her voice ruined it all.
My guy at the windows really wants you, Dula Peep.
Between Dua Lipa, Caroline Polachek and Magdalena Bay, I've been really impressed by some pop/dance hybrids over these past few years.
Mommmmmmmm❤❤❤❤
fuck
She ate, I fear
Dua you ate. You served. You queeeeen!!!! On repeat
Dua taking us back to the 90'/00's LOVE IT❤❤
В кліпі мільярд мужиків але я дивлюсь лише на НЕЇ 🤲
how come she explained me better than I could explain myself ❤
Love love this song so good

Ok the song is great but I'll bookmark the audio version instead because this mv seriously gives me the ick. Also, I can smell this room.
Damn, this is catchy.
The too many choices issue. Dua seems to be the right person for this.
LOVE this Vibeee😍
The song is a dance song and the whole time she’s setting!!!!! The MV should be way better then this honestly
It's ...Dua loopa🔁✨💙 bop
I know it.. its Kevin Parker on the track baby.
So Dua is saying she doesn't like feminine looking men?
❤❤❤❤❤
Love you dua lipa❤❤❤ Love your voice ❤❤❤❤❤
I like the song. But i don´t dig this video.

Queen😍
Very nice 🤩👌🏻🎶 Thank you to everyone who contributed... ❤️‍🔥
This song would allow a much more fun and colorful "Hunting Season" video. Specially do not like the dresses of men in this video..
It is absolutely nice the song, love it. The video is so boring and nothing special.
New Dua
OIJ
Who thought there would be some training ? 😅
😍 exceptional track ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
I love the bass in Dua's songs equally as much as Dua herself.
THIS IS SUCH A BANGER AND IT OUTWEIGHS HOUDINI SO BAD
This song is just so bad, i love Dua but girl whats that ? after future nostalgia you do this ?
First Houdini... now that... I'm so blessed to live in the age of dua lipa making music ♥

Well I possess all those qualities. cool music.
😍😍😍😍😍
"Training Season"  Are you Someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair Is that a compass in your nature?

Dua Lipa you i love her songs beautiful!!! ❤❤❤
Eu nunca vi a Dua Lipa tão preguiçosa num clipe só, a gata se levantou pra sentar de novo (no mesmo lugar)? Mana? Cadê a dança mulher?
New timeless music!
I love you dua
This time the clip supposed to be really hard for Dua, she usually cant stop dancing 😂
She's killing it! ❤👏
Love the lyrics! I wonder who inspired her to write this
Absolute hit machine ❤ the woman can do no wrong! 😍
So she's ready for a real men, got it
What an enchanting voice 😭😭
pec
She was uncomfortably close to cursive with that last "ovahhy". Otherwise, a cool song. There's a new level of nuance with Kevin Parker on production I feel, though I'll be curious to see if Dua's fans and the general public respond to that.
She never dissapointed❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This song is a HIT already, Dua never fails!  Let's support it 💪
NOW I'M HAPPY ❤
Amazing ❤❤❤
Thanks 🙏 you Dua❤
Thanks to dua lipa and madison beer for releasing a good music lately i'm obsessed!
Yyessss 🔥🔥🔥🔥
@Dua Lipa is always takes me to back 90's
i was thinking how pop isn't the same without britney spears and these 90s artists and here comes miss dua to prove she can take it back!!!
нічого собі)) дуже рада таким новинкам від таких талановитих людей
Yeah my babe!!
💋💃
Guys let's make this song number 1 altogether
What A Graet 💙🎼Training Season🎼😮
❤magicienne comme un nuage magique au goût de barbe à papa ❤
Dua Lipa is absolutely STUNNING in this music video. Love the cinematography
Nostalgia 80 's  pop songs love the vedio also so much❤
Всё слово пацана пересмотрели что-ли, везде этот стиль гопников из 90х
She saved us from Covid.
Wow 🔥🤯🤯
Thanks Kevin Parker for making this fire
I ❤ Dua Lipa, but don't like this song and don't like this video, sorry.
Dua reviving pop music again. Iconic
In grammy, It sounds fresh(I mean I know it was live in grammy, but audio version sounds so electronic.I love drump elements in live version
Good job amazing song what a performance
This video makes me uncomfortable.. even as a man.
Cada vez que la escucho me gusta más. Y todas sus versiones 💖
*the text hits the point... it's dangerous when you can drink testosterone in glasses*
❤❤
The song ist amazing! I'm going to listen for years!  But am I the only one that think the Video seemsna little of feather of Sabrina Carpenter?
Inception power Dua 🎉🎉👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼

Already better than Houdini. She’s coming to save pop music again.
Love song
This needs a lot more of attention
I recommend you to open a music village in Ethiopia transparently. Ethiopia residents respect singers now. That will make the music industry far better.
Another Grammy worth song 🎉🎉
Dua ❤
Who love this song so much like I????❤❤❤ 👇🏽
I dunno if this or Houdini is better
Love again song again ❤
Oh my god....I love it already. Great lyrics.
Such a sad song!!
Será que pasa la Bongos como le pasó a Houdinni?
Monotonous
I’m sad! Video is really boring 😢, sorry Dua

SOO HOT
It's really good yet simple. The album is about to eat. I don't want to speak about it way too quickly, but do you understand how hard it is to create a coherent era in both aesthetic and sound ? Yet Dua and her team are killing it so far.🔥🩵🔥🫧🔥🩵 Her signature sound is ✨️...
Dua lipa and her music is my type
THIS ERA
I was in the back in one of the shots 10/10

Boring Video
I wish she kept the same intro music that she used in the Grammys
1:01 reminded me Monica Bellucci's Cigaret scene
Dua Lipa is amazing! Can’t believe Malaysians had the nerve to harass and bully her 🤬🤬🤬
Qnd a mina quer um "tempo" ksksks
I hope it's a grower because it sounds like an album filler to me
Love you, Dua Lipa!

Dua is medicine, when ever I m in depression 🐷
I said thst if there is one bad word, which is lost common now a days, I switch music, dua lipa and sofia carson, not only where ambassador of unicef sofia the American and dua the British, but I listen to both music and there is not one single swear words inside. Bit I don't think sofia carson is a popstar.  I need to listento her songs again
I love you so much girl, you are so strong in your songs 😅😊😊🎉
Sorry that was a really boring video. I was hoping for more
I'm truly disappointed with this music video! I was expecting good stuff as usual, but NOPE!!!
The art direction!!!!!!!! Concept and execution beyond on point, as always
this song was produced by tame impala too??
This comment won’t get a single like 😢
I prefer Houdini, but this is good too. 😍
Buri nazar waley tera aankhen nikal ke gotiyan khaali hai..
We need an acoustic version
I instantly click when I see a new Dua Lipa song ❤❤
ура
lagunya uenak. videonya gak nyambung sama lagunya.
I wish we got the original so people could stop hating on the simplicity of this one😢
Посидела в кафе. Сняла клип. И пошла домой.
Dua Lipa, my favorite singer. I'm been hearing her music sinse 2017 and thanks to her for been so iconic. LuvU DL
This is everything😢❤ 🙌
Floop era

Girl you have done it again. Always raising the bar for us all. I would say I'm suprised, but I know who you are. I'm proud of you.
amazing song , boring video
Mother served ❤
Her future nostalgia era was better 😅
boring MV ever. 1 set, 1 normal costum, no hair style, no choreograph. so dispointed with on her who used to be #1 BB with many hit songs with creative MV
Amazing ❤❤❤❤❤❤
SONG OF THE YEAR
iiilllyyyyy so muchhhhh
HOT 🫶🫶🫶
❤️❤️❤️
yesss❤❤❤❤
A massive band can’t even make a song this good and she’s solos it
pop music
😊😊😊😊😊❤❤😊❤😊
I love it❤❤❤
Sounds like her song “break my heart “ 101
Loved the song at the Grammys, so I‘m a bit disappointed, that the one break (where only the background singers sang) is not in the actual song. I think it was such a good part in the song and instead in the final song it‘s just the repetitive „training season‘s over“ line… :-/
Mommy thx
Up to date music for woman in this world today. It is very intelligent and valuable when woman see and understand their value.  Because nature of woman is always love deeper than man. So to make life more meaningful and happy to live. Woman should learn to be the one who chooses not to be chosen. Great song Dua Lipa. ❤️💪❤️
gurl this should've been the lead single!!! so much better❤
The New Queen of the music ❤❤❤❤❤
Amazing song
Nice!! 💥
the best video I've seen in years!
Dua just did it again! Hit after hit. Mv, instrumental, lyrics - everything about this song goes SO HARD🔥🔥🔥 Thank you Dua for saving pop music, keep going like this in 2024!!
the fact that IVE been waiting for this song to come out and it’s FINALLY OUT😭😭😭
Loveeeeeeee yAAAAAAAAA ❤❤❤❤
This feels like Im back in the early 2000s enjoying pop music😌😌😌
😻😻😻😻😻
Love you dua 💞💞
Sexy💕🔥🔥
This has a 90's Brit rock feel to it, but the sound is so 70's. Rockstar Dua
I'm here for it!!! ❤
It's just waouh 😮
AMAZING!!!!! 🔥
Dua Lipa has no bad songs
Boring
I LOVE THISSS💞
Zaebis' 👍 Dua, never stop your singing, please.

I'm leaving this comment here, so after a week or a month when someone likes it, I get reminded of this masterpiece song! 😘😘💋💋
Ага
If you are reading this "I give you my happiness for a day" I hope you enjoy it wisely  👌👌
Oh she is in Big fantaisie! Center of  the Univers !! Your london univers ! Lol. Nice song 90e a little britain!
I'd be one of those men too if I were a guy lol

DUA NEVER DISAPPOINTS!!! CANNOT WAIT TO HEAR THE FULL ALBUM <3
The best. Dua 💞💞
Like this ❤❤❤❤
Killing it as always
Who is Listening Before Going To School  👇
She is one of those artist who have lots of hits but with a weak fandom. Or probably maybe bc she doesn't surround herself with drama. Drama rules pop industry sadly
Very Interesting and Relaxing ❤
Another good song
❤love you dua
AAAAmazing!!! Loved it since the Grammys, has a great beat, I was waiting for a choreo tho lol. 🙈
I know that this will be a Hit - without watching it
Nmms yo sigo ❤
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
Dua Lipa is my goddess!!!! 🛐❤️⭐️
Best birthday gift ever from Dua😭😭❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥

This song is giving what's supposed to give 🔥🔥
No Nudity ❤❤❤
LOVE ITTTTTTTTTTT
Ждем в России с концертами в Крыму и Донецке !!!
😤 flawless possibly 😒
Lo siento pero esto me gusta más que el remix de Yes And con Mariah de Ari…
wow so nice song
Fan of dua but this one is an Average!!
Well, this is underwhelming. Song's good though.
Honestly both videos from this era are kinda disappointing without replay value, the song is nice
QUEEN DID IT AGAN 🫶🏼
❤️
She is perfect ❤

All men revolve around Dua like the earth revolves around the ☀️
BIG love DUA LIPA great song. Im in heaven.❤

I don’t like new Dua Lipa, sorry
Love you Dua  😍
Dua is carrying the music industry to heaven. Edit: (Here after the album release) “I Was Right”
Conclusion is we always want someone who doesn't want us and avoid and reject the ones who want us..
Keeping the music industry ALIVE
Odhdiw😂❤
😍❤️
Я так понимаю это про олений хоровод)
Why do performers always have such a blindly loyal audience that isn’t even able to give adequate criticism. Only people with completely bad taste can write “incredible” or “this is a hit” on this video🫥🫥
Fácilmente yo estaría allí peleándome por ella. Hizo un video de cómo nos tiene en realidad 😅
💗💗💗
she saving others..
Así me siento ❤
I love the song but the video gives me anxiety
💖💖💖
It must what sex with a  doG is like.

Thank Dua for saving our pop

Dua Dua Lipa Lipa

Mucho tiempo llevo soltero, y esta canción me hizo sentir identificado en cada fragmento.   Dua Lipa por mucho tiempo.🔴
🌟
I love ❤️
I fell  asleep with this boring video
Song is fire but the MV is… 😢
Omg!!! The song is 🔥
Dua you´re so gifted for doing to excite us with your music... Love ya!

THE VISUALS ARE INSANELY WELL DONE + THE SONG = SPEECHLESS
Dua creates the kind of music that really touches you in some way. I can identify with the lyrics and feel every single word.This song is another masterpiece...Thank you so much Dua ❣️
She is way better than most but she's not shoved in our faces like some who are not only less famous but nowhere near as good.
Not me waiting for her to break out in a dance the entire time 😢
BILLBOARD HOT 100 is ready for this song.
Ok
Never sit with an ellbow on the table and drink from a cup, heldt by closed hands. Unless you are in resistance against the regime.
Una palabra: INCREÍBLE 😍😍😍
I've already made love to this song ❤
ME EN CAN TO ! ! !
What do we do now?... freak out!
❤❤❤😊
this video made me dizzy
amazing
Incroyable !!
Hello dear ❤❤I'm from India,🇮🇳🇮🇳 i had been starting to listen English song for you ❤❤Dua❤❤
She seems tired,the eyes,baggy eyes…is strange or are surgeries or makeup for the video¿
Are you someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair Is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky 'cause I've been there? And, baby, I don’t need to learn that lesson twice  But if you really wanna go there You should know I  Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo  Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over  I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don’t wanna do it just to be nice Don’t wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for?  Who understands I need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over (Over, over, over)  Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team, or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go?   You should know I need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload  'Cause trainings season's over 'Cause trainings season's over Training season's over
Dua Lipa be like somethink that just Dua Lipa can be... again ❤
Love this song
Ok i used to hate Houdini but now it's My fav song 🥺 Now i think this Will be My jam 😍
And the GRAMMY for best pop solo performance goes to:
Es más espectacular de lo que imaginé.  Se nota el trabajo de estudio. ❤❤
J'adore cette chanson ❤
Another masterpiece from Dua❤
🤯
This is just Gen Z "No Scrubs" but aight   I'm here for it 🎉
The song is a whole different vibe on 0.75x speed!
BEST RELEASE OF THE WEEKEND
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Love the song and the video. Not a fan of her red-haired look, tho.

The bridge is amazing and I really love the Halloween-esc sounds she’s recently come out with in this era (I think Houdini had a similar vibe too with the sample). I can’t wait for the album!!!!!

She's got swag

Clipe tão bem feito❤
She did it again Dua never misses 🔥🔥🔥
I love how shes just sitting there and lip syncing! Go girl give us nothing!
The music production and lyrics are so good, but as a big fan I have to admit I expected a better music video, I don’t know for what was the single artwork of her in a tube? It does not have sense with the music video 😣
Damn girl 🥵🔥❤️
stunning!❤
the most boring music video I've ever watched 😢
This few weeks I've been listening to the 2000's songs, finally and thank god your music comes. I need this so bad. 🔥🔥🔥
Jaw dropped
A comprar ese labial de ysl solo por ella 😘☝️
the fact that she managed to make it seem like it's from the 2000's makes it even more nostalgic and iconic
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜
SLAYED, DUA!!!
Need relationship advise? Listen to Dua's music.  Another Bop. Another Banger song. ❤

Dua Lipa never disappoints me 😭😭❤️

Bellísima, Poderosa y Gran Artista la Amó! ❤❤
Amazing Africa loves you ❤🇬🇭
На троечку. Больше не выходит Eng: Um 3 out of 5. I can't give more
Dua lipa is the modern day 'Dance Track Queen' and no one can tell me otherwise. Literally started to revolutionize the dance aspect of the pop genre. LEGEND.
Lack of diversity. Dua went to Japan yet out of all these individuals there are barely 2 asians
People get mad when she dances badly, now they're complaining in the comments that she isn't dancing here 🙄🤦
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Nesse clipe descobrimos o peso de ser uma grande gostosa no mundo. Mais uma música excelente da Dua.
isso que dá tomar chá de fita vhs, depois fica reclamando
Love the song but the MV was disappointing
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
THIS SHOULD BE PLAYED AT HIGH VOLUME
dua lipa always takes me back to 90’s
Lack of diversity
soy un hombre
She's without any shadow of a doubt the best in the world ❤
she knows she is the moment
Dua, its time to give us another gym mv!!!

Mejor cast que troye sivan en variedad de hombres puntos extra
She served🔥
live >>>>>>>>>>>>>
it's the best Dua Lipa's song in her entire career
whats worse then making a bad music video is making a booring one and that was rouh to get through, the song is grea shes great but that was aweful and lackluster and dull and so below the level she is at .
loveeee this eraa..dua never fail delivery song absolutly fantastic
ugh, i love Dua's pen and artistry!
2024’s Summer Bop has Arrived!
👍
Holy Fucking Bop
She finished the whole song just by sitting and let me tell you its LEGIT♥️ Once again her music breaking the floors !!! QUEEN OF POP 💎
Boring videos season started since houdini and keeps on rolling
It's so catchy
Bonito ❤

She never writes a bad song....
She’s gone blonde. Dark hair , red hair . Awaiting a fringe / bangs era 😅
Love the song hate the video

Ame esta canción ❤️
Gracias por existir, no han sido días fáciles y tener el privilegio de escucharte me alegro mucho el día ❤
💖💝
Go Dua😍
I love the song already!!
Dua te Amoooo por tu música vivo ❤❤❤❤
Good video but This will flop. Where’s the psicodélic they promised? The song ain’t catchy.  it feels like the voice is too loud in comparison with the music in the back and as she’s not a skilled vocalist the song is missing something. Like if the music goes one way and the voice melody was forced above it. Super flat and monotone, u can hear the count. The thing is that singles are supposed to be the strongest songs in the album… u in danger girl. Kevin Parker are u being censored by Warner Music? Cause it feels really plain both this and Houdini
i love dua lipa and her music. like Houdini was amazing. this song does have good moments but some parts are a little underwhelming tbh. and even the video is quite boring in my opinion. i was really excited for this song but in contrast to future nostalgia, i feel the record up to what we have got as of now is a little lacklustre and underwhelming. The songs from future nostalgia you would fall in love with them in one listen. these two songs take a long time to grow on you but it still doesn't peak like the ones from future nostalgia.  just sharing my opinion,
Dude this song is awesome I’ve been playing over and over again, I stop singing it
Why all your songs are the same?
What its this? So sooooo bad Music video , sorry
stinkies unite!
Where are...Dua Lipa's real FANS from her debut to today!🎶💜
Mid
Training seasons over frfr
love you Dua
Dua lipa and her music is my type
BOAZUDA
Song: yes girl give us everything   Mv : go girl give us nothing
Dua Lipa is honestly a Goddess, she is such an icon in the pop world!! From not knowing how to dance or carry herself on stage, to embracing the critics she got and TRAINING to be the best version of herself... THIS IS FUCKING GROWTH and im here for every second of it.
La ameee ❤
For better or for worse..🎶 Dua Lipa never disappoints 💜
"TWICE" esa palabrita me encantó algún Once que disfrute de ambas cantantes por cierto Twice regresa el 23 de Febrero 🥰🔥✨️
Yeah this one is great 👍🏼 ❤
I love the gothic gospel music vibe in the instrumental 😍 the instrumentals this era so far are *chef's kiss*
Finally ❤
Dua iz back guyzzzzz🎉
Music video is a cool Malena reference, has the same vibe as Hwasa - Maria :)
La Reina esta de regreso

Her songs always have the best instrumentals!
Пока не зашло ...
when she sings "are you somebody who can go there" it sounds so familiar to another song but I can't remember!!! Anyone else?
Lo estaba esperando 🎉❤
Ratu disco ❤❤❤❤
video director  "we need a million gay guys who appear to be straight lusting for dua"
WOW...TOP!!!!
I LOVED THIS SONG, i can’t wait to see the OFFICIAL VIDEO 🥳😍 everybody dancing, you know 🥳
Once again slaying the pop industry!
Dua never disappoints ❤❤
DUA'T
I’m sorry but what a waste of song with that video, I feel let down 😢, the song deserves at least a little dancing….

The song is not good.
Дуа Липа выдохлась😢
A mulher segue entregando o pop de melhor qualidade ♡
motherrr
Ella, es a quien todos buscamos en nuestras vidas ❤
Her videos and music keeps getting boring and boring 😢
La nueva reina del pop ❤❤
She give us nothing ✨
❤ love the Malena reference 😮
🐐!!!
the song is fab, the music video on the other hand...... underwhelming
Queen of pop music.🫅👑
I don't like her music too much but this one is great.
I kinda what the intro Was like the Grammy performance.. missing the heavy bass
Sooo boring😢 i was so much expected
DUAAAAAA EU TE AMO MULHER

Me encanta esta canción, Dua lipa me lo está dando todo más todo ❤
I'm hating this drab 2000's aesthetics and Dua's looking 40 😢
How great that she is a singer, because visual art is not her thing.   Why does your album sound like nap music? ?
this video is a representation of every country fighting to be visited by dua lipa
Me encanta ❤👌👌👌🎼🎵
Hey dua ❤❤❤❤
Love the song but she made us wait this long for a video like this? Sure artístic but it doesnt match the song. I hope the era evolves better.
🥱🥱😴
Director yelled “STOP” and Dua heard “MAKE A BOP!!”
aqui você meio que divou
Absolute banger
niceeeeeeeee
No la supero, gracias Dua❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love you Duaaa💟
Demasiado buena esta canción❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Oh my god. I expected to hope that you give us the New song,  it's so cool and nice ❤❤
It's a grower...I guess.
Dua Lips is pop royalty ❤
Incredible to see the hard work and dedication Dua Lipa puts into her music! It's inspiring to witness how she pushes herself to new heights and takes her artistry to the next level. Keep shining, Dua, with your talent and contagious energy! 🎶 🇬🇧  🌟
ou mai faking god
💛💜💯
Eu gostei,ahazou
Favolosa come sempre ;)

Effortlessly beautiful 🔥🔥🔥🔥.....😍😍😍😍..
You never disappoint, Dua! This song will definitely be on repeat. Love your voice.

LYRICS  Are you Someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair Is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky 'cause I've been there? And baby, I don't need to learn that lesson twice  But if you really wanna go there You should know I  Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo  Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over  I try to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands?  I need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo  Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over  Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team Or stuck on the sidelines Waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go You should know I  Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul (If that ain't you then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload 'Cause training season's over  'Cause training season's over Training season's over

Top class dua  I have listened to this song for an hour, Miss World ,
This video is stupid and oldfashion. 1000 men harrasing dua, was that it? Go rest dua
it was totally worth the wait
One thing about Dua Lipa: she knows how to make good pop music and she doesn’t have a single bad pop song in her discography.

Houdini and this sounds like demo of something. Weak sound, regular and simple music, random lyrics...

Dua lipaaaaa ✨✨✨💥💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋🦋
It’s like I’m drunk first of all then it’s like I’ve been waiting a trillion years for something like this. If something is better than nothing. Nothing being an endless void of darkness something being everything else. Why wouldn’t an endless void of darkness be the source of life and if the universe is only 14 billion years old. I’m just wondering how long an endless void of darkness or the source of life really thought about someone like you. Again I’m drunk high and cute story if you know what you’re writing
Dua.... the best.❤
Waiting for this for forever😊
Keep Streaming
Beautiful woman goddess, I didn't like the video.  I expected more.
Wouuu there's a reason to pray her

That video portrays💯 European slave traders 😮
This is absolutely amazing ❤️✨
Likes her coffee like she likes her men, dark and strong
TRAINING SEASON ❤❤
the tame impala sound
This is the next New Rules. Well done Dua, probably my favorite video of yours. I also love "Lost in your light" with Miguel and Physical (of course.)   This has a 90's Brit rock feel to it, but the sound is so 70's. Girl. Rockstar Dua for the win.
Ponganse a hacer ejercicio 💪
Future Nostalgia Vibes ❤✨️
I love you my dua lipa you are the best 🥺❤
Thought that one dude was Dame Lillard lol
Te amooooo

Who understands? I need someone to pull me close~ 🎶
This Is such a bop, it must be The lead single and not Houdini 😩

Where are the lesbians?
I know this is just a pop song, but the lyrics actually do have a depth, it is exactly how I feel lately and I love Dua for this.
ITS TRAINING SEASON
The video is a great fit with lyrics 😮 awesome song.
Eres lo mejor dua lipa, cada tiempo nos sigues sorprendiendo con buena música 🥰🖤🎵

Que canción tan pegadiza 😍🥰😍🥰
Training sesión ❤❤
Even if the video is an exaggeration, It sucks that many women IRL are objectified and harrassed. For celebrities its 100x worse. I guess its what comes with the job🤷‍♀️ Doesnt make it any better though 🙃
Her music is sooo good!
366,844
😍😍
Musically speaking and in terms of Sound, no one is on Dua's  level. Let the other popstars to worry about breaking records, sales etc  Dua's got the art in her music: She is delivering Sound, lyrics, everything. Goddess you are by far the best and I cant but surrender to your musical legacy.
Omg ❤❤❤❤
Mother is slaying❤
O POP CONTINUA VIVO!
Damn ... 2024 is really the "say it with ya chest" year, huh? Just sayin the quiet part out loud? Hot damn
I have to say, I fell in love with this song 10 seconds in. It's upbeat, the rhythm is smooth, she sounds great and the video looks great. But what I like is despite the upbeat tone, the song has a deeper meaning to it and it's a good one. Bravo Dua Lipa!!! You hooked me again...
Omg!!¡!!¡!!¡ dua... i love you that's all
Great job, like always 🤟🏻

Great video Dua! I’ll be in England in 2025!

Fantastic.
She does it again boom another hit.
What training do you mean?? 👀
Dua is a super star😊
Slayy❤

She is saying: I deserve the best because I am a queen, if you are not willing to give it to me, you better leave.
outstanding from Dua as always
Finnallllyyyyyyy❤❤
This song deserves the greatest recognition, I love it💗
Dua Lipa's song is like a mesmerizing journey through the depths of emotion, with each lyric hitting like a wave of raw honesty and every beat pulsating with infectious energy.From India with love 🇮🇳❤
ARTISTA
PERFECT SONG ❤❤❤🔥💯
Hitmaker ❤
Díooos mi favorita forever
This is Taylor Swift's true competition. Dua Lipa has ALWAYS been Taylor's true competition. Idk why tf "Swifties" even have Beyonce's name in their mouths. Everyone want to be on Beyonce's level.... yet NO ONE ever will be.   Also. Both Beyonce & Dua can actually sing. No shade to Taylor.... but I'm still mystified by her fame.
La amooooo
Charming, Gorgeous, Elegant ❤❤❤
es que yo la amo
E ela não cansa de nos presentear com qualidade. Eu amo essa mulher, sério!!!
You love to hear new Dua Lipa music!! This one is especially perfect.
this song goes out to my DA ex and the guy I´m "dating" but he don´t wants to commit and is DA ofc. The next one should listen to dua and be a real men who can communicate open
APENAS VICIADO 😍😍😍😍
Rainha 👑 ❤
Los hombres de este video me representan en su totalidad cuando veo a Dua Lipa

ABBA Lipa?

LOOOOVE THE SONG. But honestly, this music video is the least exciting of her career
Impressionante como Dua sabe servir pop com profundidade ❤️

Wooooow amazing❤😮
ARTEEEE, ESTOY ESPERANDO EL ÁLBUM
Temazo
i'm ded. she ate so hard she put herself in a food coma and the other girls were starved. she left them nothing.
I love Dula Peep ❤
GREAT song, GREAT  cinematography!!!
She is amazing 😊😊😊
Yass Dua with the YSL lipstick
This track begins reasonably ok. Dua Lipa is a very average singer suitable for Pop, but the vocal style for the early part of the song is intriguing. Unfortunately the mundane and repetitive over powered beat is annoying, drowning out the basic rhythm guitar notes. When you think there is a great build into the chorus, it falls completely flat. This track had potential, a lost opportunity with writers playing too safe, to keep it too simplistic. Seriously vary the beats, not complete repetition and over powered. Bring out more of the musical element. It is poor, but this is typical commercial music, what do I expect. Rating 4/10
Good song!!!💊😎
🖤✨
She never fail us she always comes with a bop after a bop. Queen ❤❤❤
THATS THE COOLEST POP ICON RIGHT THERE
🎉 The best 😍
Dua Never disappoints
<3
That's how girls behave on dating apps with likes that they are constantly receiving.

Cool
What a boring video! Amazing song but waisted potential on this video
AAAA ITS FINALLY HERE!! I LOVE IT!!
Nossa uma música tão boa para um clipe tão sem graça que desperdício, ela tá com paralisia ou dançou demais em houdini que não aguenta nem mexer a colher na xícara, deslike.
Her voice gives me peace ❤❤and stranges vibes...I simply  love Dua ❤❤❤🎉🎉
She never misses! 🙌🏻💅
the song is SO GOOD but this music video......
TEMAZO Y VIDEAZO ❤🇦🇷
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA empezó la nueva era

I was expecting a different video D:
Come on let's support Dua, she deserves the BEST! ❤
Luv everything  about Dua and its be some to see her continue  to drop hits. I'm not sure what they did to her voice in this song but she has one of the best voices out there live.  No need to auto tune or whatever they did  . I'll still be rocking it though
Who's waiting for that Dua will get up from the table?
Ella como siempre Diosa ❤❤❤❤❤nunca nos decepciona te amo DUA LIPA
Knight Rider! With this Duas, ALLAH would Love to Love you, He whispered yesterday! And He said, He would understand! Training seasons are over!
Dua never disappoints! But I miss the colourful and creative music videos from before 😢
This video is nostalgia 😍 only for early 90's 😢😢
What a boring music video lol. Great song tho
This era of Dua is just INSANE.  Houdini and now this!  Im just picturing what the album will be and just- i know it'll be the best ever! Dua is a popqueen but not a mainstream one, definitely different for what she does! And i live for that!
First
the red head cute…
THIS IS INCREDIBLE

As an honest fan of Dua Lipa, I really appreciate the efforts of everyone who's part of this music video... But, this is lamer than Houdini and especially the likes of Break My Heart and even New Rules... Song is amazing, but could've done more on the concept of the music video... Still a fan though 🥰😍😘
Cara, como essa mulher consegue ser tão incrível? ❤
GIRL YOU ARE SERVING SO MUCH 💝  GAYS DE LA MÉXICO REPÓRTENSE

Queen is back 🙌🏻✨
Duaaaaaa
Fan to Fanclub:  A soccer game of shadow overview:   ‘Strategy is Savy than performance’🎩.   From there to knock out round.  Score 2-2. Half time passed, may be remaining minutes to go.   Every time not a strike time, score up not required.  Leftover times to hold the score line and play defensive, for survival . Once 90 minutes over, there is another round called ‘Penalty shootout’.   Good players are NOT , who scores only,  Such as Gabrielle Batistuta,  But those, Who plays as per the Tournament requires as Zinedin Zidane. Avoiding mistakes is another great strategy, in many cases.   Obviously, Fans buy tickets to see adventurers match, entertaining as equally as strategic/charming.   Being onboard on Jack’s ship is an advantage sometimes, not freaking every time.  🏁💀🪽  Lets bring ‘em to more competitive level.🛼🥊🎸 Happy Friday🫵
this is so hard to watch

Diosa 🔥🔥🔥
I love you  Dua, you are my eternal love

There's something ABBA-esque about this isn't there?!
First Houdini now this! She’s like a star outshining everything negative and this new song is phenomenal. Maybe this could be a album?

🔥
Thanks for saving music 🩶 te amoooo Dua
Dua ❤🇧🇷
In less than forty seconds she addressed the intoxicating lure of Toxic Love cycles and possibly the reason why some people are drawn to them.
It’s that time of the year…🥶🥵
I love how this song is about choosing the best guy because you have lots of options but not all the options are good and we all deserve to have the best person by our side ♥️
Dua Lipa hace música increíble y aunque los vídeos son promedio siempre tendrá apoyo incondicional.
She is so BAAADD Gahdamn 😮‍💨

When is Ajayll going to react to this??? lol
Nurse she’s doing that mother thing again
Adorei a paleta de cores
Sempre bello e bellissimo ❤
No bailó pero amamos igual
Interesting visuals for a music video. Story doesnt appeal to me but I get the concept. Cinematic in alot of ways. Especially when things start picking up. Music videos are back. I Love Dua and her music. She just always sing bops. Also have a slight crush, but thats to be expected😄
I love the red hair,dua lipa at at again with another hit song🎉
Thank For Dua In Songwriting Credits   Special For Kevin Parker
Work Diva she really has Main Character Hair amongst the crowd
You are literally the 2nd best pop musician I know, the 1st is Lady Gaga.
Another instant pop masterpiece from the current darling of contemporary pop music. Queen Dua Lipa always comes with another  sure fire smash. The music video is very well done,  and totally different than anything Dua Lipa has previously done ❤❤❤
❤you Dua Amazing
Kevin Parker goat
This feels like the start of a zombie movie... 😅
Amen
😍😍😍😍
she ate and fed at the same time
Today, February 14, 2024, Im leaving this comment to say that im going to become a very great artist and that my songs will have much more recognition than the current one. When that happens I will come to comment below this comment so that those who trusted in it can be pure witnesses. Many blessings for those who lean this way, and do not confuse arrogance with faith and security. Greetings 🙏🏼
a pop savior through and through
ICONIC
Duaaaaa sua linda

Canta muito
It makes my head dizzy watching this. I wanna throw up
Love it
Wow this mv stresses me out 😂 I remember someone said that online dating for men is like looking for water in a desert, and online dating for women is like looking for water while swimming in the sea (surrounded by water on all sides but it's undrinkable), and this mv shows that 😅
♡
I gotta say it's really nice 👍.
"Got me feeling vertigo" is right!🌀🌀🌀
😍😍😍😍

Sounds a lot like "Lay all your love on me" from ABBA
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN IN THE WHOLE WORLD
Música perfeita
This sounds really bad😢
Where is album pre-order? Common now!
Let's debut this song in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100... let's give it what it deserves.....
SMASH HIT!
Where were the harmonies?😢
Dua nunca pero nunca decepciona ❤❤
Did Caroline Polachek write this?

Dua is the Picasso of music, only art does
Só faz música boa ❤
Loveeee heeer 😍😍😍
La canción muy buena, el video muy fome 😢
Está canción es hermosaaaaa
MEU DEUS
The MV reminds me of PAPI of JLO
I love Dua's sweet beautiful face. I love girls that have a lil bit of blush not exagurating clown pancake white with a lot of red blush. Just natural makeup with a lil redish pinkish blush. That's fuckn sexy.
EARLY ILYSM DUA ❤
No se porque últimamente siento que la música de Lipa tienen el mismo tempo, la misma base . . . Aburre

La canción no es tan mala, pero el video es horrible. ¡Yapo, dale, sácate otro temazo! El último tema bueno fue el de Barby, porque "Houdini" es un bodrio

I love this!
THIS NEW ERA JUST GIVES AND GIVESSSSS. VOCALS , PRODUCTION, VISUALS , VIDEOS. WE ARE BEING TREATEDDDD
I really really like the song But the MV is quite questionable But that's my opinion, is not even matters guys hahaha
The song definitely deserved a better music video
This song defines my mood now
I love the concept of this video, she’s just vibing amidst the chaos. She totally pulls off the red hair too. Love it!
YEP THIS SONG SLAPS!!!!
IT’S A HITTT
Better than yes, and?
I LOVE YOU DUAA 💗
ermmm she should have released this before she goes to sing it live at the. grammys and sounding off pitch...... she has worked greatly and it shows but that performance was sloppy and we should have seen this video first
❣❣❣🌹🌹🌹
mother
Dua Lipa is honestly a Goddess, she is such an icon in the pop world!!💖😍
👑
she's sooo pretty omg
I expected a dance music video but this video ATEEE omg Dua u never disappoint us
❤ Albanian ❤ Pop Queen .
NDL
Like attendance
the song is a bop... but that music video... is a film. amazing. mesmerizing. I have no words for this work of art
Great song, and she is gorgeous as usual.  But I wish she had a bigger budget/better team for her music videos.
This video is so beautiful by the way are we kidding here??? Vincent Haycock you have done incredible work
I know this is just a pop song, but the lyrics actually do have a depth, it is exactly how I feel lately and I love Dua for this.
Finally here 😭
DIOS AYUDAMEEEEEE POR FINNNNN DUA ESTA SALVANDO EL POP
DUA LIPA is this generation's ABBA by HERSELF!!!! LOVE IT!!!😍

Salvándonos de tanta ….
Es como un cuadro en movimiento, súper contemporáneo 👍🏻
So this is how it feels
Dua dua duaaaaaa 2x hianati😁
Eitaaaa maravilhosa essa Lipa ❤❤
Come al solito 🔥🔥 però troppi bambocci Dua 🖐️
She looks so good
It’s an alright pop song but Jesus wept, the amount of processing on the vocals …it sounds like AI.
Dua Lipa you have done it again
TE AMO
Au revoir 👏
Te amamos Dua ❤
I'm not her fan but I have to say that Dua Lipa just killed it one more time. Just dope!
Amo la parte en la que dice "No quiero tener que enseñarte a amarme bien". Porque tampoco es que existe un manual para eso, pero lo básico sería la sinceridad, el compañerismo, el respeto, la fidelidad, el amor propio y el amor que le das a la persona que tenes a tu lado. Ella no está para chiquilinadas ni juegos de suspenso.   Las pociones de las que habla Dua son igual a las relaciones que tuvo en toda su vida, ella ya tomó nota de todos los "tragos" amargos y/o dulces que se llevó de cada persona que conoció, ya no está para juegos ni para andar corriendo detrás de alguien, implorando/rogando por un poco de amor .. Como dice en Houdini "Atrapame o me iré, Houdini" dando alucion a que va a desaparecer/gostear a aquellos que no la valoren y tampoco demuestren su amor por ella o sean una redflag andante.. Al principio del video hay mensajes de voz masculinos con las mismas excusas, las mismas situaciones, pero ahora es diferente, ella sabe lo que quiere y lo que no y por eso desde una mesa mira como todos se disputan por ella mientras Dua se encuentra tomando una taza de Té tirando factos, diciendo que "La temporada de entrenamiento se acabó". 💋  Dua es simplemente icónica 💅🏻💜
LINDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Dua back with another hit!
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Una diosa ❤❤❤❤
This álbum crazyyyy
Love itttttt
2:41 Dua's Deep voiceeee is all i pray

I love Dua lipa
Tbh i don't like Dua Lipa the first time i saw her, but now i swear there's not any single day that goes by in which i don't watch at least 5 videos of her 😊😊 I'm addicted to her voice
Sempre entregando tudooo
The most gorgeous female singer for me , don’t fight me , it’s my opinion 😁
You are amazing ❤
Loving this song😊👍 The music video and its visuals are beautiful ❤️👏 can’t wait for her new album!
❤
Kinda reminds  me of the early 2000s  and mid 2000s
❤🌀🏁🍾🍿🛴🪄👟🎽💨
Hey Dua!
Soy de Argentina y me estoy esforzando para colaborar con esta gran artista 🇦🇷🧡
Dua ❤❤
Maeeeeee
vocal doubling on the second chorus is really what sells the tune. i would 100% go butt2butt w dua lipo.
I miss when my wife had black hair
Hymn
Take all my money my queen
Stronger
SO GOOD 🔥🔥🔥
Smash
YESSSSSSSSSS
I dont know... it's giving Love Again... great concept but a little all over the place (I'm talking about the track itself) I'm loving that she's going back to her europop roots
Deliciously 80s this must be the theme of her new project
As a lifelong advocate of sitting I feel so seen
VAMOS ESCUTAR MUITO PRA CHEGAR NO TOP GLOBAL 🌍
Dua is the Pop STAR of music ❤️‍🔥 So stunning in the music video!
Love the song, but the video is such a bore unfortunately. After the pop perfection performance at the Grammy's, and Houdini's music video, I was expecting something more dynamic.
dua lipa’s music is amazing she will never get old and this song is amazing
Dua regálame diamantes
Perfect❤
Dua te amo ❤
What a video and a song, cant wait to see her on tour again!!!!
Amo a dua lipa

It doesn't matter if you put shit it in your head she is beautiful
She is the moment for real ❤
Goddess 👑🍷
Thank you Dua for saving pop genre and bringing it back.
UNBELIEVABLE!! 💃 I ❤ IT!! But, if you ever step over to the other side, no training necessary....🤭
Dua Lipa is amazingly talented. What a breath of fresh air to have a stable talented pop star for young girls to look up to.
Oooof the video kinda gave me anxiety. I was waiting for a dance break, outfit change, build in the story. I’m obsessed with this song it’s giving ABBA vibes but the video 😞
Pop queen is back at it
OMGGG
ICÔNICA
Dua Lipa Forever ❤🎉
Looks like the cover art for this video took inspiration from Faye’s Black Mascara
Dua siempre sorprende es una de las mejores cantantes
Duaaaaa you’re the best🥹
This has a massive ABBA feel to it! ❤ the modernization of ABBA!
You have my heart, Dua!
Like aquí las que tienen Lipa pero no suenan como ella... ☹️
Yess DUA
Video is terrible but the song is a bop!
Not the video I was expecting thought there would be some mad dance routine given the beat to the track missed opportunity I think still a dope track ❤
I love you Dua!!! What a hit❤️‍🔥
❤️‍🔥
Love you dua lipa❤❤
give it up for dula peep !!! 💗
I love this!

Awesome! Dua Lipa is Lady Gaga's new generation!
How small was the budget for the video? It’s sucks.
Is it just me or the video is giving like 80’s vibe because no filters, no greenscreens, just pure realness its quite refreshing especially with the newer artists relying on greenscreens 😅
Just in time for Mardigras Sydney ❤
I haven’t heard this song before  💀
❤❤❤
Dua lipa is one of most beautiful and unique artists of all time love thisss ❤😍
Not as good as grammy version
Omggg
Diosa!

Pop star but having melody is the real deal.
I'm in love 💗
Are you Someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair Is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky 'cause I've been there? And baby, I don't need to learn that lesson twice  But if you really wanna go there You should know I  Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo  Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over  I try to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for, who understands?  I need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo  Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over  Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team Or stuck on the sidelines Waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go You should know I  Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul (If that ain't you then let me know, yeah) Conversation overload 'Cause training season's over  'Cause training season's over Training season's over
Thank You Dua this song and your team are amazing!  Hits Hard for Me atm so thank you! 🙏🏽
Dua Lipa is the best 😍😘

goooooood
I can't stop listening to this song:)
0:46 Look at her. How beautiful, sweet and sensitive she is, In her eyes I see the humbleness, gentleness and kindness. There is no doubt Dua is the chosen one, the twin flame passion that will help me grow as a man, being a new man when I meet up with her. For some reason she will be, or rather already is, part of my life. It doesn't matter if she is way too famous and rich, the most important thing is that I really love her for who she is, bc anyhow many rich people are more humble then poor people
MOTHER DUA LIPA IS DULAPEEPING
TE AMO DUA
THE BEST SONG ❤
She ate
Uff 🔥🔥
You're just an angel

Does anyone know what song she sampled for this? I’m almost sure there was a song with an identical chorus goes like come to me or Ethan like that
GANG BANG
DUA IS HERE TO BRING BACK THE MUSIC INDUSTRY!
Dua always iconic 💋💋
This song SLAPS. I’m already obsessed!! 🫶🫶
A HITT
Sooooooo much eye candy in one video and I'm here for it!
she never misses!!
DUA, RAINHA DO POP!😍🔥
Out of expectations
It is very understandable why most people cannot get used to this kind of sound in Dua, because they are used to songs that are straight forward pop, and there is nothing wrong with it. Meanwhile, the last two songs released by Dua have many synth/psychadelic nuances, the music is particularized, there is a lot of attention to detail in creating a sound that is more raw, unlike everyday pop. Still, it's pop, but infused. I personally like it a lot, it's very rich, it has variation an unpredictable melody (here people sometimes feel uncomfortable, because actually good music, with alternative pop tendencies). I was surprised by someone who commented, no, she can do better... she has reinvented herself and the way she sounds after an album that spent years in the center of attention, with people saying she reinvebted retro/disco music!!!! It’s obvious that there's work, there's dedication, it's not super duper extra mainstream. Doesn't that tell you something? Her music is CURATED! It's a bop, and its quality!
OMG this is Soo HOT 🔥🔥 🤩
Hold me close 💚💚💚
Salvando o pop ❤
arrasa mo
Like always shining 💗😻😊
🔥🔥🔥👌 💯 Every day more proud of everything you do my Beautiful Queen. I love you Congratulations Excellent video and song 24\7❤ in my head 😊

OMG, DID I JUST LISTEN TO TRAINING SEASON????????????????
she never disappoints, I'm already addicted. In a few years this era will be iconic, we will remember it like the moment when she had red hair. We will soon see comments like: who is listening to this masterpiece in 2026?

Dua Lipa she never disappoints us when she releases a great song as a masterpiece jam with good video and catchy lyrics that made us fall in love with her songs. Hi and more love and greetings from Romania 🇷🇴 since we always love Dua Lipa's songs regarding her music style in videos and music songs overall ❤
Future Nostalgia B side or whatever you call it, she'd making fun pop music and we're here for it
MOTHER ♥️
QUEEN. OF. POP.
I'd fumble
EITA QUE SAIU ❤️🇧🇷
If dropping a Banger would have a competition, Dua will definitely ace that competition ♥️
That's the best depiction of how it feels like to be a straight girl on dating apps
Dropped a masterpiece again!!!!!
I’m obsessed omg 😭
Não erra uma ❤
Dua Lipa hairstyle colours during 8 years of her music career:  2015-2017: black hair 2018: black and blonde hair  2019-2020: blonde hair  2021-2022: black hair again  2023-2024: black and redhead hair
AMAZING 😍😍😍😍
Love love love the song, but this video was disappointing. Where’s the choreo? This is such a dance track I can’t believe you sat for almost the whole video :(
Dua ha revivido el pop
dua lipa pop >>>>>>>>>>
AAAAAAA essa música é melhor do que eu esperavaaaaa 🤩😍
its some kind of gangbang intro?
No dance break with all the men? Unfortunate.
The song's superior level. Video is disappointing. Could be great but it's not.
What a dua😩🩷
Dua may be the only artist that could roll daft punk out of bed for one more collab or album 🤜🤛
🥵🥵ela nesse clipe, deusa e música perfeita
new remixxxxxxx ⏳
TE AMOOOOO
MI AMOR TE AMO ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I feel identified with any of those boys who look at her like that through the window
TEMAZOOOOO
Queen of cutting budget in her Music Videos. ❤❤
A música já é basica , aí vem o clip mais básico ainda kkk nem parece a Dua Lipa que gravou com estética de cenários grandiosos e até na lua
She wanted to show diversity in the video instead of dance moves. Boring and woke video
❤❤❤
DIOSALIPAAA NUNCA NOS FALTES. 🌀✨
Que madre
Yay!  Cant believe I am seeing this 37 minutes after it dropped.
❤
Dua once again you serve nothing but pure talent! ❤
Te amo Dua!!!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤
the male-box is full and cannot receive any more messages 🙌🙌🙌🔥🔥🔥🌪️
Dua Lipa is SLAYING and ROCKING this year like a QUEEN with great hits.
Omfg the mv is soooo underwhelming… the song carried
Not bad, but i prefer Houdini.

When we listen the chorus part of song, it's like there's an arranging problem.  Listen 2:05 carefully.  The transition was very poorly made. Disappointing!

Kızı gördükçe saçımı boyamamak İçin kendimi zor tutuyorum
Dua tu nunca decepcionas 😭😘
Aguanta narcisista
Ok I’m going to be one of the only honest comments  These songs are not the level of standard we are used to from her. This is poor and disappointing.   We all know she can do so much better than this generic record. The potential is still very much there.   You haven’t quite nailed this era just yet, sorry Dua! Love you still❤
Buen video esta bonito
RA RA RA RA RAW RAW 🪭🪭🪭🪭🪭🪭
ITS GONNA BE A HIT
Better than Houdini ❤

Lyrics:  Are you Someone that I can give my heart to? Or just the poison that I'm drawn to? It can be hard to tell the difference late at night Play fair Is that a compass in your nature? Or are you tricky 'cause I've been there? And baby, I don’t need to learn that lesson twice But if you really wanna go there You should know I Need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Convеrsation overload Got me feeling vertigo Arе you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over I tried to see my lovers in a good light Don't wanna do it just to be nice Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right I hope it hits me like an arrow Someone with some potential Is it too much to ask for? Who understands I need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload Got me feeling vertigo Are you somebody who can go there? 'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah 'Cause training season's over Can you compete? Now is your time Run when you hear that whistle blow Are you on my team Or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go? For someone to tell you to go? You should know I need someone to hold me close Deeper than I've ever known Whose love feels like a rodeo Knows just how to take control When I'm vulnerable He's straight talking to my soul Conversation overload 'Cause trainings season's over 'Cause trainings season's over Training season's over

DUAAA❤
Reina, amore mio siempre bien bella❤❤❤
Me encanta
AMAZING DUA!!!😍😍😍😊
I love Dya Lipa
Ela sabe que é gostosa
The song ate but Dua you need new management, this video is blad AF for today’s day and age. It adds NOTHING to the song, where are the costumes? Different scenes? DANCE BREAK? you definitely need more gay men in your team because all of this was totally produced by straighties 🙄🙄🙄🙄.
Let's be honest. DUA LIPA has NEVER released a bad song.
The song is meh.. not bad, not good. Mid table. Definitely not a streaming song. The idea is there but something is lacking again. Flop era for Dua? 😢
Cause training season’s over
Sabe muito!!
Diosa ❤
EU AMOOOOO
😍😍😍😍
I LOVEEEEE
She’s so fine
As always. FIRE ❤️‍🔥
Oh yassssssss Dua
SHE WITHOUT DUFA IS POISON IVY

THIS SH*T IS CRAZY HOW ITS DONE SO PERFECTLY, THE BEAT IS ON FIRE. AND the Training season's over. 🏁 ❤️ 🌀
training season is indeed over
I’m just so very much impressed by how far she’s come. Back when I heard “scared to be lonely” for the first time I just knew she’s the STARRR
visual representation of how it feels to be a woman at a nightclub lol
Dua just keeps getting better it's a bit ridicolous at this point.
🎧🔊
Wat a perfect moment to be alive.
nunca me decepcionas
Dua did it AGAIN! What a hit!
We are having our training season with this one❗❗❗🗣️🗣️
She is very tired of live at the Grammy and worst that coffee 😂break
❤❤❤❤❤❤
DIVA BABILONICA
I loveeeeeeeee it!
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
This sucks. Houdini is better and I’m not even trolling she can do way better. And where’s the budget for the music video 😭
the Grammys version of this song is Way better then this but Cool Muisc Video, Keep going Dua, don't Stop until you save Pop Music!
Mucho mas patente Kevin Parker, ya estoy obsesionado a primera escucho y mil repeticiones del adelanto.. Training season's over, Dua is here.
Dua nós também te amamos,vem para cá mulher,beijos do Brasil 🇧🇷
A que hora se despierta esta mujer  que hace todo bien... ❤
Why is she romanticizing having sex with illegal immigrants?
Неймовірна!
La reina siempre conquistando. Te amo. Qué temazooo
kween
It’s bad that at the beginning the voice was corrected, it’s kind of thin. but overall it's not bad

lyrics:  are you someone that i can give my heart to? or just the poison that i’m drawn to? it can be hard to tell the difference late at night play fair, is that a compass in your nature? or are you tricky? cause i’ve been there and baby i don’t need to learn my lesson twice  but if you really wanna go there you should know i  need someone to hold me close deeper than i’ve ever known who’s love feels like a rodeo knows just how to take control when I’m vulnerable, he’s straight talking to my soul conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo  are you somebody who can go there? cause i don’t wanna have to show you if that ain’t you then let me know yah cause training season’s over  i try to see my lovers in a good light don’t wanna do it just to be nice don’t wanna teach you how to love me right i hope it hits me like an arrow someone with some potential is it too much to ask for who understands i  need someone to hold me close deeper than i’ve ever known who’s love feels like a rodeo knows just how to take control when I’m vulnerable, he’s straight talking to my soul conversation overload, got me feeling vertigo  are you somebody who can go there? cause i don’t wanna have to show you if that ain’t you then let me know yah cause training season’s over  can you compete? now is your time run when you hear that whistle blow are you on my team? or stuck on the sidelines waiting for someone to tell you to go? for someone to tell you to go? you should know i  need someone to hold me close deeper than i’ve ever known who’s love feels like a rodeo knows just how to take control when I’m vulnerable, he’s straight talking to my soul conversation overload, cause training season’s over  training season’s over

Vraiment pas terrible le clip...Je crois plus d'inspiration. C'est normal à son âge tellement elle a connu la gloire rapidement. Il va falloir se remettre en question et essayé de proposer autre chose que des ersatz de années 80.

MY NEW FAVORITE DUA LIPA SONG  THIS IS SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!
ATEEE
it's 2 am in here and i'm awake because i've been waiting for this since i've watched the grammy performance. AND IT'S JUST AMAZING
Queen Dua Lipa! ❤️
Dua is back, oh my God.🤌🏻🤍🎉🎉🎉
Indeed that grammy performance and the whole mystery of this record has worked for her, bcz many of us dont really follow what dua lipa puts out, until that magnificent excellent grammy performance which got many people obsessed, that completely brought lots of attention to the song. Its almost like Gaga's born this way, she premiered it live on Grammys stage, and hid the song tight until the release date which got her so much attention... Naturally people like a little mystery. Congrats to Dua lipa and the new success. Im obsessed with DULA PIP!!!
DUAAA
I already know this is gonna be in repeat
She came and saved pop music. She is the hit girl
ahhhh NOOO DIOS TE AMO, TEMAZO TEMAZO AHHHHHHHH LLORO

DEUSA PERFEITA RAINHA
I love Dua but this is literally so mid. She hyped up DL3 as being a departure from her previous sound, but so far Houdini and TS just sound like FN rejects. I thought the video would improve my opinion of the song but where's the energy?!? I was expecting a big twist at the end or something but she's literally just sat down at a table the whole time.. she can do so much better, this feels very go girl give us nothing, and I'm so sad cause I was so excited for her new era </3
Dualuv
I LOVE YOUUU
So fresh so cool so niiiice. Thanks queen. You deserved it, like always !! ❤🔥🏇
