It’s so beautiful song ❤️🎶🎶🎶🌈🙌
It’s beautiful song 🎶🎶❤️
anyone else think ricky gervais could do a cool cover version about  Reading
Andreas Johnson is crying in the corner
Grandissima canzone ❤
'We're On Our Way Now ',..Is One Of Noel Gallegher's Top Tune's.
One of the most underrated songs ever, what a tune
This is such a beautiful song.  Noel Gallagher is such a versatile songwriter.  The man who wrote Bring It On Down, She's Electric, Waiting For The Rapture, Gas Panic, Let There Be Love, If I Had A Gun and this gem.   Thank you for existing and becoming a songwriter.   💓
Those lyrics will haunt me for the rest of my life
Only just discovered this  And just resonates with me.
Lembra muito do meu pai com covite mais melhorou graças a Deus
😭
Why hasn't this song got a billion views. Love Noel. So talented 👏 ❤
We need more love people ❤
Just an absolutely amazing song this, the music, the lyrics, Noels voice, a masterpiece.
Simply beautful this song ❤👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Always felt this was written after Caroline Flack took her own life.
The best songs are never played on the Radio
I seen him play this on late night tv. It's one of those songs that takes you on a journey. Amazing song.
This still rocks my boat.
0:28 😂❤😂😂😂😂😂
He says it all in these humbled lyrics    Thankyou again Noel Women Are Strong We Have The Strength To Over Come 💪
"Good-luck in the afterlife"... brillinat atmospheric song.
I Really Love This❤
Love this so much... simply incredible Noel.
I'd say him an his brother is so gifted with song writing they both are amazing
masterpiece
I love ni made iwa
Beautiful understanding of addiction and how the person is still worthy of love. If you’re lucky enough to have the support ❤ if not then u can still survive n thrive I’m proud to say 😊
Great song. A very catchy melody. Classic Noel Gallagher
Amo essa música, mas é triste, por isso não ouço muito,   para não baixar a frequência energética
Great song!!😊
Saw him do this live in Los Angeles last month . Amazing. underrated song
As a musician myself and a bit older than Noel I’d like to say a big thanks for the HFB music it’s been the most inspirational in feeling and thought to me for a long time . A true artist keep doing what you do I’m really enjoying it 👍
A song about this divorce and the events and processes which led to it - The first lines recount his regret at leaving Sara to go home on her own - He laments - 'Remember what might have been Had I walked you home and said, "I'll see you later"' He goes on to say what happened as a consequence- 'But when the morning comes, you'd gone to meet your maker.' Maker is a metaphor for mother. Upset by his dismissive behaviour, she went to her parents, it was the beginning of the end of the reationship, and he was finding it hard to come to terms with. "Stood on top of the world And when the cold wind blows, you say the chill don't matter.' A reference to Sara completing the three peaks (Scottish Mountains) walking challenge for charity. 'Having the time of your life But when you take those pills, does it make it better?'  A reference to Antidepressants or something of more of a recreational nature? Finally, declaring his love for the loss of his soul mate ''Cause you got the love, you got the love, lady'. If you look at the woman's image in the video and compare it with the picture of Sara on the cover of the Album, "Who Built the Moon",- they look remarkably similar.

I love this song Timeless
What a masterpiece. What a beautiful song! :D
2023 ANYONE??
One of the most emotional tunes. Simple, no frills, great backing vocals. ❤ it 👍👌
This song is Noel’s best solo song so far and by far.
Every time Noel brings out a new song he keeps amaze me. Keep up the good work mate.
Who spilt all the secrets to their man. Confess rn😭
You got the love you got the love lady 🥺
You chose to drift away. Look at you now. 😢  these lyrics though genius, they hit me hard.
Stop crying your heart  out is my alltime fav❣️
Just love love love 😮😅❤
Played this at my brother's funeral...exit song. Exit to the grave. He was listening to it during his final weeks. Pierre 43..leaves little boy aged 3. Very brave man. "You just were never going win in this world PJ. You would be so proud of them".♥️
Hare Krishna
Me too 🍻
love noel
Definitely about Liam
Liam's my man! But this is 1 of greatest songs I've ever heard in my life! Typical noel absolute genius! Live forever!
God.. where did you pull this out from Noel. Unreal
This is magical. I can't believe I just heard this now. Maybe I heard it just at the right time in my life. I'm in awe of this.
Does anyone know of any similar tracks to this they can recommend
Love this song!
Love loss lost but you everyone has a path people life pull you down love overcomes all
Noel, I love you.
This man helped define a generation.
You are a living LEGEND Noel , thanks
Essa música é incrível 🙌😍💓
Fckn tune
love this song
Stunning..🏅cast no shadow
I'm lucky to have experienced Noel's music during my lifetime. A genius musician.
Belíssima canção.
First song of Noels I've ever listened to very meaningful song 🎵 🙏👌
I wish oasis would get back together.I had these played at my sons funeral.They were the last band he ever heard.This song seems like part of it was made for my son.I no he found peace that he couldn't find here and he's free as a songbird xx
This song was actually shown too me by my girlfriend of 7 months, it’s her funeral song she wanted too show me this so, so if that I ever loose her I can listen to this to remind me of her. She has a Chronic illness and it is now also a part of me because I have to look after her and I wouldn’t go back for the world. When it says “if you take them pills does it make you better” she has to take pills to keep the pain away 🥺🥲
Top musician!
I miss you monty
Beautiful song
Most overrated musician of all time. Total joke. Narcissistic and pretentious.
1.8k people do, no matter what they say, hes effected all our lives, in a poitive way, cheers noel!
Ma wee bros acoustic version is well better 👌🏻
Linda demais...essa música...
As músicas de Noel são maravilhosas !!! Simplesmente o melhor do rock!!
Genial! Pungente. Sem palavras para descrever...
Que buen gusto para las melodías! 🍻❤🎸🎶
Eu amo essa música.. é maravilhosa !!!
Am I the only one thinking this song has some Red Hot Chili Peppers Stadium Arcadium vibes ?
That Don't look back in anger ending
a typical Noel song... about anything you want it to be
I have had depression since I was 16. I was never into music and had never heard of Oasis but I heard Don't look back in anger and it changed my life. I still suffer from depression but Oasis and Noel and Liam have got me through some very bad times.
A BRILLIANTLY SUPERB song! Sung with much ARTISTRY and PROFOUND FEELING by the ALWAYS VERSATILE and FOREVER GREAT ARTIST, MUSICIAN, and COMPOSER that is Noel Gallagher----- LOVE ❤️ Evelyn O'Connor
It's a massive missed opportunity from Ricky Gervais that this masterpiece didn't feature in After Life.
What a tune Noel's songwriting is incredible
A piece of art. Whenever I listen a Noel's song I try to imagine it with Liam singing it....and this one would be fking great.
I not need good luck. Thank or advance not take for a men voice. Really. Not no you and I don't care about tricky people thier allway be thier. Sweet
Oh what ever
Worked in one night club as a bouncer. Visitors to nine. Shoreditch they where nice. Met a French lady and her friend. Met a man who liked women clothes. He was fun. I wander where are they now. You met people in this life and they go. I think I am not really sad a small part missing other people to talk to
This needs to make the Ricky Gervais After Life soundtrack
My man Noel finally putting out good tunes, damn
Sonzera...
Brazil aqui eu curto!
No, the pills don't make it better 😔
this is great...noel can go far with his material...masterpiece
At 1:21 it really reminds me of Glorious by Andreas Johnson.
Nice coldplays cover !
With every little trick they'll try and drag you down
Give u yer due that is a quality quality song.. But Liam now with selling out Knebworth twice, the etihad and hampden makes him the best front man ever, who had been in a band.. Robert plant top singer, like your good self would struggle to sell out the ally pally.. But you can always mention your money and give the real people no props..
Instant classic right there mate
i think i 've heard a sample of the song Glorious
Ótima. Música
Amor Fati…🕊
de Osasco SP Brasil
música internacional linda 😍 romântica, mexe com minha sensibilidade
I've all i need
"AMAZING TUNE" ...."FANTASTIC ARTIST"....Best song i've heard in a decade by far....
Beautiful song
Don't know whyaiaiaieiiii
Love that
Leonard Cohen vibes ❤️❤️❤️
Think I've heard them 2 notes on 20 songs
Will be the parting tune for one of my children's funeral next week.  Loveya Noel
The master pulls down another classic from the clouds.  What a tune.
Great song, should of used other lyric than Cast no shadow though
Ledgend
Fukin a brilliance
beautiful underrated song
Bother classic
Briano Dublin 💯☘️🇮🇪🇪🇭 he's easily the best of what he does
Hello Noel👋
Oh ! this is a subtle rewriting at the beginning of Glorious (on the additional voices). This is well written though. he's a real thief this Noel
He can now only write songs that would fall onto radio 2 within a year .  Gone the age of classic young, cocky noel with bad teeth, common accent, no hair products, simple shirts and a reserved and detached attitude ,writing songs with an edge to them .
Show! Show! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Genius. Beautiful song
Am I the only one who feels that is the shadow of Jessica Greenfield (NG backup singer) ?
...
one of his best
Great tune!!
I love noel, What the fuck does this song mean
💚💚💚
Sheer lyrical genius 👏🙌👌😎
Top  Brazil
Every time I hear this song I cry due to it playing on the radio on the day my dog had to be put down due to his cancer, 8 weeks later my girlfriend passes away from sepsis, sorry to be depressing but this all happened and I am torn apart.
Not a fan of oasis but this stuff is good
This would make a very good James Bond theme song
You can hear Glorious by Andreas Johnson in the background before and after the chorus
Great song, Cast no shadow and Hey now were always my favourite songs on Morning Glory, Noel is an amazing songwriter x
I wanna hear liam sing this!....
God's gift to music lovers!!!!
Maravilhosa ❤️
Beautiful song and cool visualisation... But the lyrics shown lag behind the singing :(
Noel, you are a legend. This is possibly one of the most amazing songs I’ve ever heard. Thank you 🍺
My Fav Song ever
U haven't us yet give a few yrs
Man this is so good! Noel is the freaking man
This is Noel Gallaghers  best work  I feel noel Gallagher is getting  closer to finding his style Finding HIS VOiCE so to speak His Earlier solo work seems as though he's running away from himself ,  Ok whatever call it experimenting  or whatever you want Reminds me of the GOO GOO DollS, I wonder if Noel Gallagher likes them or not?
It's a song that grows on you.
Amazing song ❤️
Liam would slay this one….
Y love music
absolutely amazing. love from Japan!🇯🇵
Great ballad. Oasis with a mature musicality. Plus .. that one beatlesy chord change he always plonks in for free BECAUSE HE CAN
for people support   youtube   MYKEYCARD
Stay safe everyone 🙏❤ Let's just be nice and maybe it might be ok ?
✌🙂
Absolutely love this song Xx
First song ive heard from one of the Gallagher brothers music, Noel you smashed it
I love Noel... 💙💙💙💙
Absolute Legend x 1/7/21 x
Fuckin brilliant, a full album that sounds like "dont look back in anger" would be magnificent. 💎
Simply outstanding.
Good song . From a great man .
Watch and learn Liam
When they get back to playing in front of crowds this will be a full on sing along anthem 👌✌️
Yep this track is epic, cheers to all
Noel always moves me. A drop of water. Pure, intense, simple and eternal. Vital and magnificent. This is 2021's ballad.
Biblical ❤️
Noel’s just got that gift. One of my favs George Harrison had it too.
Best ever since the departed Oasis... your the man, but together you are the world. Fuck your pride. Family is far more than your skills.... sort it & make gold again. Seen your your documentary & it was shite... love ya Noel but come on - Brothers in Arms RULES
Could this song be used in a campaign to extract us from cruel Covid conspiracy? There is one.
Absolutely love Noel more now than when he was with Oasis.
same NG song as we have all heard before...blahblahblah...hit an octave up baby for the chorus etc... still a stone cold classic though.
The 225.must have slipped with their finger ! 😇
Broke my heart that song. Them lyrics stole my soul
Good rip off of the strings from andreas Johnson , glorious
Ffs...had me in tears this morning this...its like it stabs me in the heart...its emotional as fk..hes a fkin genius...end of
FOUND IT!  Andreas Johnson - Glorious
can someone tell me what this song sounds like, it's very similar to a song I know, is it the Verve, Coldplay,....?  Something 90's I'm sure, cheers in advance :)
Perfection.
Best song in 20 years no doubt about it
💙💙💙💙💙
As much as he annoys me at times with his rants and self opinionated comments, this is pretty bloody beautiful
Mito
Golazoooo!!!!!!
❤
This song is superb 🙌
What a beautiful song.
Excellent words.  Drops  a belter in ,when needed . Cheers Noel.
Absolute shite.
Love this 💝
Love it 🥰
Most artists disappear or disappoint after years in this industry but noel just gets better and better beautiful song
Kin brilliant song!
How's the Lucifer freemason club Noel? Can't break your stupid oaths!
Shinny day, Liam's rock n roll, gloomy day, Noel's ballad. That's all I need.
Surely this can't be the promo video for this song
This is class
What a song ,..the melody,  the guitars , everything is superb,, best song of the year
He never makes a bad record. A true classic artist.....  Manchester has produced some amazing talent over the years....
lovely song nice mood to it last week a friend of mine said have you heard noel  Gallagher's song so i said no any good and 15 minutes later it  came  on the radio instantly likeable wonder what he means by after life is he talking of death ie ressurection back on earth I'm not sure
If you put thumbs down to this…..you need to have a deep look at yourself.
Mad how you can equate a line from most of his writing to a time in your life and it hits you in the feels even after what could have been years.
Back on form lately.
Andreas Johnson ‘Glorious’
a dash of the 90s meets the now. love it
Andreas Johnson - Glorious
❤
FAb ! Fab , fab.
Zzzzzz…
Anyone else think this sounds like Ed Sheerans Runaway?
Just love this song when it comes on the radio. Amazes me how Noel just keeps pumping the songs out and no writers block, unless I'm mistaken ?. beautiful sound.
Love this song gives me goosebumps.😃
Beatles end. Listen.
Absolutely beautiful track. Absolutely beautiful. xx
J'adore !!!
Awesome
Love this song
Wonderful
Andreas Johnson - Glorious.
Sorry but I want family. My sons won't be pets and My wife won't have a Leader. And at last fight Will end and Friends Will gone  Tom Solari
Nothing hits home like when discovering a masterpiece by Noel and play it for 20 times in a row. What a beautiful emotional moment.
Nice song, and I loved Andreas Johnston's Glorious back in the day too, so it's nice to hear it sampled in this.
I never chose to drift away. You have g so much wrong
Just incredible .
Make this the next Bond song!
That's a weak song. Unfortunatelly, by now Noel Gallagher is just as useless as his brother.
At last, a performer who has put the ROCK back in rock and roll. I know he does not like his songs being labelled, but genius must be acknowledged.
Class👌
Is this song about LIAM?
Un chef d'oeuvre ..
The melody with string section at the start reminds me of another song and its annoying me so much, can't get it 😫
Fabulous song! On repeat … on repeat … on repeat
The best Songwriter in 90's
Noel’s last album has been utter shite but this is the Oasis vibe we have been waiting for.
Loving this new song, absolute class 🤘🤘🤘🤘
Totally ripped off Andreas Johnson's  Glorious with those strings Noel!
It's his new anthem... (as a High Fling Bird)... this tune is so... well it's Noel FFS!!!... It's "new", but it's gonna be a classic... like I said... an Anthem....
Tuuuuuuuune
I hear familiar music in it....its driving my insane. What is it??
Merci à toi Noel Gallagher  de toujours produire des sonorités hors du commun.A chacune de tes sorties,un chef d'oeuvre au rendez -vous.Tu es un dix comme on le dis chez nous Suis un super fan depuis Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire)
Noel...the best songwrighter of the modern times 🔝🎶👌❤️
Love this song, his voice is soulful
Ace ...meaningful words.... lovely music
beige
Noel mascando o irmãozinho dele nas musicas e na voz.
His best song so far!
Frigging awesome
Frigging awesome
Beauidiful la tua canzong
This is the best peace of music I’ve heard in a very long time.....like a missing peace in the heartb....Thank you
The Best
imagine this infront of thousands!!!
Great song!  Noel Gallagher was great the other night on Wossy!  LEGEND!!
Belting song. UP THE CITY NOAL
Happy birthday noel
So much being sampled here and I can’t name a single one. Really grown on me this one
Top stuff from the guvner. Absolute stunning song. More of this style please.
Utter genius .....
Very good song well done Noel and the guys.
If I heard this in my dentist's waiting room, I'd think this is bad. Noel, you wrote good songs man, come on. Fire, or fuck off.
Chelsea 1-0 Man City
Absolutely great song for this year 🤩👍
For the love of god Noel, stick to what you do best, beautiful tune
Love this song! Keep your eye on the afterlife noel!👍👍
Living the dream
Best one in a while ❤️
Boom
He's a bit of a dickhead but by christ he writes some good songs!
So insightful, just beautiful.
Sounds like a nod and change of heart to oasis reforming
We look forward to seeing you soon in Italy to do live rock nroll
Superb boss song English style oasis from the old days wonderful voice hello from Italy
Noel always bang's on about The Beatles but for me he has surpassed them.
Stunning song. I never liked Oasis - I thought they were yobs, but I was wrong... they are incredibly talented guys (individually and together) ... thank you Noel. This is class xxx
Please someone put me out of my misery and tell me what the strings in the background remind me of, sounds just like a song from my youth, late 90's I'd say. Its bugging me!
Pure magic !!
Let's dance with the death!
jeez this is a tune!
Absolutely stunning  Genius....
Great talent.... standing on the shoulders of giants.with vey big shoes
Sadly lost my pal of 50 years last week! Heard this song which could have been written by me for her - it has given me the words to express exactly how I feel about her and about the memories and history we shared! Good luck in the after life Sadie…. Thanks Noel x
Nice one We would like to add you on our music blog!
He's n1
One of the great songwriters in history, 30 odd years and still writing anthems.  His top 10 songs can more than compare to any of great songwriters in history
Music from the soul f ing  brilliant
This is what a work of an experienced musician is. Beautiful ❤️
I used to like oasis and Noel you became a legend... it’s unfortunate that everyone is to tolerate some of the crap you’ve released recently. If you wasn’t a legend and loaded songs like this wouldn’t get any recognition. Give up and move on! 100million to be reunited with your brother!! Do it for free... your fans already made you a millionaire.
Noel you keep smashing it,,well in and i have to congratulate your boys on winning the league
If you look very closely at this video... you can see two of... Noel Gallagher's... high flying birds.
Musica e voce molto sensuale ♥️
Great Noel!Great Song!
Good songwriter,shame he hasn't got the voice of Liam
This is just a bunch of cliches strung together. The lyrics are nonsense.
Amazing song just saw him.on Jonathan Ross show great 👍absolutely fab
Go on Noel lad. 👍👍👍
LEGEND
What a glorious piece of song writing!!! Nothing else needs to be said….
Good luck in the after life 😩 what ever that may be ...
Pure Munia...Talent
Noel going back to his acoustic roots, thank you Jesus
Love the way the lyrics contain oasis titles. So simple yet so amazing Noel. You really are a god like genius..
Loving this
cool !
YES  From🇯🇵
Don’t like this soft music I prefer team Liam
Beautiful song
This is a paradise song, may I say the best song ever!
Great Song 👌
Chooooooooooon
Noel refusing to be pinned down by the doom and gloom of what's been going on around the world. The titles of his past few songs have been daylight in this ominous climate.
❤️
Thaks my brother!
Not really a fan of Noel’s solo stuff but this caught my attention 🙂🙂🙂🙂
Noel, this is the best of the best!! Come a long way since Erwood and bondage pants lad😉
Sounds like Andreas Johnson - Glorious
Can anyone hear 'Glorious' by Andreas Johnson?
i'm crying now
Beautiful
Esclusivooooo
TOP
Mesmerisingly beautiful
The bloke is a genius & if not that he's GOD
Please stop realising shit mate . That’s a questionable b-side . We get it you’re old and content. Write a banger ya fanny
Excellence 👌
Noel Gallagher could be a composer.  How he works with such easy chords and arranges them is mind blowing.  Absolute legend. ✌🏼
Unbelievable song just like the song writer
Love this song. Is it sampling 'Glorious' by Andreas Johnson?
James Blunt Vs Noel Gallagher? 🤮 It's a tough one isn't it? 🤔
with Liam singing on it, it would have been so much better, but still, happy to hear new music from Noel
man I love that the verse is in minor with minor harmony and when it switches to the major chorus the harmony turns to major and then flattens back to minor when it switches back to the verse. That’s really what makes this song for me.
By far his best song ever
This is a better video than THE video . Doesn’t match the feeling of the song in the official video.
Nice song this one. Check out 'Roaming Heights'
Probably the best song of 2021 so far. Thank you very much, Noel for making a song that has been your best song, since the songs from ‘Who Built The Moon?’
A pretty dark and moving piece of art.
Phenomenal
Great track Noel 🔥🎵🔝😍
Best songwriter since Lennon
Well done, beautiful 😍
"The Truth Can Be So Hard To Swallow"
The Lennon of the 90’s
I wish the next studio album would be in the same spirit as this single or the first two albums. Who's BuiltThe Moon did not succeed.
Tremendous 👌🏻
Anyone else hear 'Glorious' by Andreas Johnson in here?
I don't know why〜🎶
A great song
💓SSuper🌀BB👌
Noel Gallagher = Savior of Melodic Pop
Too many references...
Glorious, Andreas Johnson 🥰
This was a slow burner, but it's definitely grown on me. Loving this song now
Biblical
Cheers Noel thank you
ANDREAS JOHNSON GLORIUS
Is this about him being in love with a prostitute who died?  Y’all think?
I love Noel but all his songs sound the same
I'm not sure how his music influenced others, but his music made my life.  I want to walk the way you want and I want you to walk the happiest way Maybe this life was borrowed from you Love you. Whenever
💞
EXCELENTE!!!!!!!! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏💋♥️😘👍🥰😃
Always great songs
Cast No Shadow... I have the chills.
Glorious
I love your music so much
Это же шедевр
Beautiful
Love This Track
Can't stand this guy, but what a brilliant composer/lyricist.
Wow.
There's no way this song would have been released had David Holmes still been producer. Thank god he is out the picture now.
Is Noel Gallagher the best musician at the history? The answer is ABSOLUTLLY YES  PD: In Buenos Aires, Argentina we loves you, and we are waiting for your back always!
Being honest..This is the best song Noel has released since Oasis...We are avid Fans of Liam as well x
Remembering one of my favourite blues listening to this tune 💙
Bentornata anima mia💋
Definitely the best out there....ever!!
YAWN
Mix Keane & Tom Odell  disaster!! Noel Game Over. Take a break .You were once a great songwritter but now absolutely not.And you can't sing
I’m a big fan but I’m getting the feeling he uses the same chords and lyrics, just in different order from song to song. Getting boring
Magnifique ! Magnifique ! MAGNIFIQUE 👍
What a belter. Hope he goes back to doing his thing and stops with cosmic pop stuff.
This has gone straight up their with my all time favourites those lyrics are relatable for me atm
Oasis tipical Good😇
Still love ur brother. But man,wtf....still love you too. Masterpiece.
he never stop evolving
It's decent.  I think I'd enjoy a pint with Noel.  Still,  people change and age and the tension he had with his brother translated well into Oasis songs.   There's a different passion Noel gets out in the dysfunction of his old band.    love the geezer though.
He writes songs n his sleep.. genius
As always guv 💯💥❤
Cool song  and  music  !  I like a  lot  !  Hi Noel  you are  the  best  !  I always  listen  to  your  songs  !  Hello from Italy!  👋😃🎶🎶👍👏👏👏👏😊🤗❤
Shite
This song makes me feel some type of way I haven't felt felt.
As much as I love this track brilliant  thank fook Liam's  still bringing  the rock n roll to the table
Would like to have heard this stripped back with no choral singers, (think sad song)
wouldn't have learnt to play a guitar if it weren't for noel, love from Seoul Korea.
Love Andreas Johnson me.
Genio, cejón!
Blowed?
Good stuff! Probably Noel's best tune since "dead in the water".
typicially brilliant
♥️🇲🇽DURANGO DGO MÉXICO... 🇲🇽♥️                                         🙋‍♂️
This sounds beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
My Inspiration for all of the Melodies that flow from my heart to my guitar.
The chief is back. Thanks noel. You may not think how love you. As possible come back in Milan 👏❤️👑. You give hope. Always  support you.
It just sounds all samey these days with his previous  releasee. Boring!
I thought it was OASIS song ..🤔🤔
<3
I've waited too long for. Anew song beautiful musical craftsmanship.
could imagine this song playing as a soundtrack for a movie that has a bittersweet ending...
❤🇦🇷❤🇦🇷
Cracking cover!  I havent heard Glorious by Andreas Johnson in ages!
Legend enough siad
Would love to hear this live. No vaccine, no mask, no pods and no social distance. Remember ppl. That's the way we rolled only two years ago. We're on our way now to where??
Liam could only dream of his song writing team coming up with something as good as this!
Ma solo io percepisco i Tiromancino?
Beautiful
TE AMO
Noel volviendo a lo que hizo en Chasing Yesterday... Por fin! 👌👌👌🔥
This song is so beautiful. Hope this is the start to left behind that weird style of his last album
Noel deserves receiving Nobel Peace Price for this
Since the early 90s to present day, Noel Gallagher has proven he is the greatest songwriter out there !
Chasing Yesterday Vibes
Josh Robinson touches himself to this song
Waitting for you in México
Pop Rock 2021
Brilliant song....pretty sure I can hear  Andreas Johnson's Glorious tune in there somewhere?? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Still creating beautiful music. Talent never dies, keep on going people. ❤
noel never ceases to amaze me. leaves me in shock how touching his songs are. both old and new ones.
You know when you find yourself singing a song you've not heard for years, and realise it was a different song sounding similar that triggered the memory... Ace Of Base - Life is a Flower. You're welcome.
The man is a genius. Four chords and a bit of poetry, he has made a song that it is becoming one of my favourite. What a great Musician!
Great tune, the backing track kinda sounds like glorious from andreas Johnson from the 90s just a wee bit
Absolutely love it!
Necesitamos un nuevo álbum, NOEL :'D
Watching Noel on Live for Absolute Radio May 3, 2021.  Love this!
Noel plays it safe...but Liam has the rawness
This song makes me extremely sad I don’t know if that was your intention Noel but thanks
Sounding American here lol. Especially 1:34 "Wouurrrllldd"
Reminds me of the Sky sports song...Sheree bringing in Checking me out  Making me Glorious.....
Oh la weá fome!
This song deserves a GRAMMY
Brilliant...no one compares to you, Noel!!
This fella can’t do no wrong!!!! NG you legend
Pure music. A story to the song! The man is a legend. And still keeps producing songs like this. Can still remember when I found Oasis back in 94. When I found music
Once again shows he's got old and soft needs Liam back more than ever
I love Noel but I find this a bit boring ...obviously I'm in the minority judging by the comments but it just doesn't move me like his songs usually do ....but if we all agreed what a crap world we'd live in
Every single time he gets me. Every single fu**ing time.
This man is something else absolutely love his music loving this tune so much! 👏👏
Stick to this kind of songwriting and music style Noel. You are a genius at it! So moving and so beautiful... You did it again!
I hear Glorious- Andreas Johnson
The dislikes are all from Liam with different accounts.
Garbage. Rubbish. Shite. Awful. Dude, get a band. Or give it up.
It’s a great song and Noel’s still the best songwriter around but I do wish he’d do more rock n roll and not be so produced and clean but I remember Owen Morris saying how Noel wanted everything perfect like ABBA
Brilliant,its always awesome
The new cover for "Back the way we came" reminds me to a 60's cover from a folk singer.
Could be a really good james bond song anyone else think the same
These songs are eternal !!!!
What's the famous melody after 1st chorus?
Have had this on repeat all day - why do I always ruin my love for songs this way :-(
Pd che pezzone!!!!
Got my first baby's ultrasound scan on Friday 30th, a day after this was published. I guess my wife and i, We're On Our Way Now.
He's a different class to Liam, loving this.
Viva Noel...!!! 🇲🇽
Even though I'm a writer, no words can express what this song means to me - but I'll give it a go. Stop Crying Your Heart Out saved my life twice: the first time parked up by the train tracks, the second time sat in the dark on my bedroom floor with a pile of pills in my hand. I started medication to stabilise me, and I've been on it for a long time. My life has changed in that time, and now, this song has made me realise I'm ready to finally come off them. Thank you Oasis - and thank you Noel.
This beautiful song is helping me get through grief. Thank you, Noel.
Exclusive track listing for new album: 1. Please look back nostalgia  2. What’s the story former glories 3. D’you know who I was 4. Don’t go away (seriously, don’t) 5. Sham pain super no one 6. Faded out 7. Let’s all make believe (this is good) 8. The importance of being irrelevant  9. Photocopy chords (Bacharach attack) 10. Going nowhere (reprise) 11. Mandatory anecdote (my gold digger)
A fantastic song, meaningful lyrics, really grown on me. Look forward to hearing it live. Another classic from Noel. Cheers
Go listen to Sleaford Mods instead.
Am I the only one to notice that the lyrics are a complete cut & paste of all of the older tracks?
This new tune is quintessentially Noel. A real stadium swayer, beautifully written and well composed. I'd expect nothing less from the chief these days. He really is the gift that keeps on giving...
What is the sample in this (violins at 1:21 and the ooooo, ooooo), it's doing my head in that I can't name it
What a tune. This,  dead in the water,  sail on,  just belters out of nowhere
Lovely little song. Is it about anyone specifically?
Jeez. Middle of the road crap. Parts lifted from Andrea's Johnson 'Glorious' from the 90s.
Another tidy song. A little formulaic but nice enough.
There is literally not a day that passes where I don't listen to a song either written or sung by this man...still churning out quality 30 years on, for me to listen to in 30 years time
Best from noel in my opinion, love it
They keep coming and keep getting better. Blokes a genius 👏🏼
A response to Liam's One of Us
Bit boring really
I continue to love everything Noel does. Just music 🎶 🤙🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
WOW!
Love You Chief 😭
What a beautiful tune... Temazo..
I once met Liam in the Steeles bar on Haverstock Hill (London, NW1), around the corner from where he lived at the time. He is nothing like the brash, arrogant character portrayed in the media. He was sitting on his own with a pint of Guinness. I introduced myself. Such a personable, kind, intelligent fella anyone is ever likely to meet.

Welcome back, Noel. Great job! 👍🏻
I always listen to this after working.
This is a comeback for me. I used to listen to NGHFB a lot but then I moved to another stuff, different many genre, so I was kinda forget for a while. This song got recommended to me recently. It feels somewhat nostalgic listening to this, as of many of noel's songs are, I guess.
Fucking Genius
Yes Noel top tune mate
Noel never disappoints !
This song keeps growing in me. Can't wait to hear it live!
I bet Liam wishes he was singing this...
Great new tune
Noel doing what he does best, taking someone else's music and making it his own.
See you all in the afterlife.  We're all part of a masterplan.  Needed this.
im crying 😿😿
awwwwwww
That subtle refrain from the song "Glorious" - nicely used.
It’s not hard to work out why Noel doesn’t want an Oasis reunion: he’s been making effortlessly beautiful music for a decade now. Why go back to all that tension and stress?
Noel going back to his roots love to hear it
Beautiful 🤩
this sung by liam would be amazin
Cool! but when you return to oasis?  it's part of your soul!, don't let it go!, don't lose yourself D'You Know What I Mean? don't look back in anger We will be waiting for you,  like Christians to Jesus.
this definitely does not suck
noel is god
La cuarentena le hizo genial a Noel....temazo
Simply amazing, he's done it again
Geniuuuussss!!!!!!!!!!  Que Temazoooooooooo papá
These last two simple beauties from him are maybe the best solo things he’s  done. Id hoped Sail On, I’d Pick You Every Time and Dead In The Water were leading to something special and they have.
Masterpiece
Gracias Noel por tu arte
Well what can i say,,,,,,Noel,,,,is a genius,,,,,awesome song,,,,,thank you  Noel!!!! from a  Chelsea fan,,,,good luck  Man C,,in the  CL...
...
I love this man!
Love this song you and Liam can make great songs together like the bee gees !
Great tune Noel!  Like it.
We are on our way now and I don't know why.
Brilliant 👏
I instantly loved this song.
💓
Still got it
Amazing ❤️
Once again, Noel knocks out another spine tingling melody, fantastic. Love it.
Enchanting tune. The background is somehow a wanted reference to Glorious by Andreas Johnson as an anthem to the 90's music "grandeur", to which Noel belongs at full title. Can't listen to this without a nostalgic mood towards such good times, with Oasis as the front line of a group of unforgettable bands giving us gifts of ingenuity and pearls of thoughts, reflections and happiness. Such times flew away as life goes by. But we have to be grateful with a smile.
Shite
This is 1 of my favourite songs
This is brilliant
Keeping the dream alive
Is this supposed to be to, or about, Liam?
We are on our way now - to a good world order !
noel gallagher ripping off a robbie williams song. something I never thought I would be saying.
Just perfect!
너무 좋다......!!!!!!!!!!
The greatest of all time
This sounds great musically and production wise but as with alot of his recent stuff, the lyrics are not going to win any poetry competitions. He's wasting great compositions with shit lyrics.
Who does the tambourine????😁
Back on track i hear! This is Nice.
Sounds like Andreas Johnson glorious with the strings!!
I listen to all your music
Hi noel gallagher I love your music
Love it
Just so talented as has always been ❤️
Capo on 3rd. Intro: Em, Cadd9  Verse: Em, Cadd9, G, Dsus  Chorus: Cadd9, G, D, E Transition: Cadd9, Cm
Good song as always but I thought he said he wanted to get away from the 'Oasis sound' and do something different...That didn't work and seeing how well Liam has done flying that flag, it was only a matter of time before he reverted to type!
I had my eyes closed listening to this the first time, and when it got to the "Doesn't cast no shadow" line I just opened my eyes rewound it and just absolutely fanboyed when I saw the lyric it was such a subtle but well placed throwback to Oasis' song of the same name while still having great meaning within the actual NGHFB song itself, absolute genius lyricist.
Awesome, a song for the times, Noel has always been good at that! Love it
Genius
This one has John Lennon vibes which is great. Solid tune.
Noel and Liam are rubbish solo artists. Bring them together and boom. Shame. Very depressing track.
couple of oasis references in here hey now cast no shadow
Imagine if Liam sings this!! 😳😛
Back to his melancholic best
BIBLICAL✨
Looks like the old noel is coming back and imo after the last 2 records it's welcomed
This sounds like Travis and i like it !!!
He is back ladies and gents
Wont lie. This is the first  song I have liked since the songs from Chasing Yesterday
FUCKING LEGEND!!!
Noel you’re a god
Lethal
Me gusta, buen tema! Ojalá vuelvas pronto a Buenos Aires. Fuí a verte en 2012 a Geba, en 2019 en el Luna Park. Aguante Noel
Noel’s best song in years after the poor last album good to see him back to his best.
Noel is the greatest ever to live !!!!
Adoro tu música Noel...gracias por regalarla a este mundo 💜 Desde Argentina!!
First A+ song of 2021
It sounds tired
good job, mr gallagher! wow...
Brilliant song
Dam he’s a pretty good songwriter isn’t he
Haha, remember he slagged Adele for coming out with this prosecco dirge.... What a weapon 🔫
NG does it again... when he stays away from disco. :)
"Good luck in the afterlife, I hear the morning sun doesn't cast no shadow". Gives me chills, what a genius Noel is.
Imagine Liam's voice on it
God! Noel, please stick to this style of music!!!
he knows what he is doing he is just a fantastic artist
BIBLICAL!
Absolutely quality kidda
Saudades de oasis
Noel és Gênio
Beautiful Ballad ❤️
Just love this
Imagine Liam singing this..... and every other magnificent song Noel has ever sang/written.
Class Noel 👍🏻
Great tune In my opinion best solo song so far from noel.  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
Amazing
But when you take those pills does it make it feel better ?
A refreshing change from the dire last album. Back to form.
Damn, what a great song!!
1:21 Andreas Johnson Glorious
His voice is great
Not bad, verse better than the chorus and a touch of david Brent in there. Decent
i heard cash no shadows😭
Beautiful
Is Noel writing to reach his TRAVIS period? What's a Wonderwall, anyway?
Amazing! Thanks Noel!
Godlike Genius
Absolutely briliant song, arrangements, lyrics, Noel's voice sound so perfect 👌👌👌👌
Loving this song. Noel Gallagher is back to what he does best and it proves that he is one of the best songwriters of his generation. This song has fantastic lyrics and it has a melancholic but uplifting vibe to it as well. His vocals are fantastic as they always are. I’m looking forward to hearing flying on the ground his other new song and the best of album when it comes on June the 11th now
🥱
I convinced the deceased person in this song is Oasis
Welcome back Noel  💕
Top quality from Noel again never lets you down
It sounds to me like this finally Noel's response to RKid...not so cleverly disguised at the last minute with the word "Lady" added?...haha. "At the end of the day, I decided I wasn't going to pander to Liam and the fans, so we threw that word lady in didn't we?" -Noel, maybe.
His solo work is definitely more interesting than his Oasis days
Awesome 🌞
wtf... phil collins?
This man never suck
I've lived long enough to see Noel write about death
Andreas Johnson... GLORIOUS. Jesus christ... I hope the credit will be on the album. Otherwise it will a court issue.
Rubbish. Sounds like a song by Embrace or something. It’s wet. Best song he’s done recently is “we’re gonna get there in the end”. Thought he might be getting some form back when he released that and then he follows up with this drivel. Disappointing.
merry with me...
Love this
The break after the refrain that seeming "Glorious". The self quotation with "cast no shadow". The 90s are back. ♥️
Best songwriter of music history.
My fave artist, saw him live in Bristol with Paul Weller opening, after Noel finished his set Weller came back on and they sung a duet of The Beatles All You Need Is Love!! best night of my life!
Sounds like Glorious by Andreas Johnson
The best song he ever wrote was a song someone else wrote first just like  all his songs never has one writer adjusted someone else s songs as much as lG...but i loved em anyway !!
This has bored the arse off me 😴
Noel Gallagher is a reciever for songs from the heavens
Another classic from the legend 💚
Capolavoro.
Hi, im russian, i like Noel songs very much, but  i dont clearly understand this song's lyrics, even with translation, can somebody  help me please, what's it about?
Bellissima
Oh, wow! This is what happens when you stop messing with that experimental scissor-sounding shit. Finally real music.
Hrs back
Wow this is so boring Noel.
Zzzzzz
This is soooooo damn good. I'm going to play this again and again, it's just so damn catchy.
OASIS
What does this man have to do, to be classed as the greatest
Good job ad always. Today he Will play in Roma..but can't see him 😭
Cast no shadow, Hey Now!, and more of quotes from Oasis…. Noel is looking back his life in love😭❤️
LOVE
Debuted in my weekly personal chart on May 2, 2021 edition :)
Loving this track 👍
Noel painting by his own numbers
Awsome songwriter
The Chief!!!!
The dying of the lightsみたい
the only one artist who has known how to turn on my heart, my soul and all on my mind, I love you Noel Gallagher, you make shine and turn on my heart with only hear all the chords that you take on your melodies, I want repeat to you one more time I LOVE YOU SO MUCH Noel.
Aka... what a life... "you don't know why".... I love you anyway Noel...
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
A change in direction for sure Hopefully not just to console disgruntled Oasis hangers-on Still as ever BB delivers the ballad with style and class....
Damn i think...... i think i like this Well done Noel
masterpiece
This is right up there if I had a gun. Noel is melodic genius
What a song 👍
He has gone all Phil Collins - where did it all go wrong?
Such a beautiful song; easily one of the best he's released so far. Tender and melancholy, it moved me to tears....grateful, and happy ones.  Hail to The Chief, and thanks for sharing more incredible music with us.
Noel Gallagher Should write a song about leaving Oasis and his spirit turning in to the high fling birds what a song that would be
Iiiiiiiimmmm outta tiiiimme.....
Took a few listens. Hooked now. The chief, being the chief 😍
cast no shadow  hey now
I think our chief is singing to Liam and his Lady 🙌 which got the love to bring our kid back🙏
This is a boring meandering song which goes nowhere, lyrically it is dire. It seems to have been released to support a best of album for a band/artist who has only released 3 studio albums and a few EP's. It just smacks of the label (his own I might add) trying to cash in on the Covid restrictions being lifted.
Trust me!! The reunion is defo happening
Who would thumb this song down?
Brilliant!
Noel can do no wrong
Delighted to say I’ve listened to this around 20 times today and it just gets better and better, Noel you are the love of my life, even my girlfriend is ok with that lol! I am so so blessed and grateful to have lived through the 90’s when Noel was treated like a god because everybody was in awe of him at his songwriting capability. He is a godlike genius because almost 30 years later he is still writing masterpieces. I love you Noel❤️
Another inimitable masterpiece from the very best songwriter Noel Gallagher. Love it!
banger
TE AMO NOEEEEEEEEEEEEL
Sounds like glorious by Andrea's Johnson
💕❤️💕❤️ I love the songs of Noel Gallagher  🎸 🇬🇧 ❤️🇺🇸
El mejor compositor de baladas del planeta
Liked it on first listen, best stuff to come from this guy in a long while.
Instead of talking about it make it #1 instead of the shite that's out now cos it's the best song this week and what else is getting through this prison sentence by the government good luck stay safe andy matthews officially the world's biggest oasis liam/ noel fan fact
You know what would make this an absolute banger?? If Liam sang it...
Absolute quality. This is the Noel we all love.
Aguante Noel y el Kun Agüero 😁👏🏼
Nice One!
How many times does he knock it out the park??? Stunning
How many oasis lyrics you spot? There are lots!
So fucking good man..
Cant help but wonder if this is about Liam
No words...
드러운 세상.. 피 토하는 음악..ㅣㅣ
This guy does it every fcuking time best there is 🤝
Can’t get enough of this! Another absolute beauty!
Great song imo.
Espectacular
too loud. Sounds grandpa
Intro is the demo version of Where Did it All Go Wrong
This song needs to be twice the BPM and recorded with distorted guitars.
Absolutely incredible track. Noel at his best!
Great tune
This is the direction he should be heading
Nailed it and I love it
Got them hooks that only Noel can do
I could listen to this MASTERPIECE on repeat all day long!~ one of the best!!!!
Does this sample (glorious)?
If it sounds like you've heard it before it's because the verse melody is stolen from Glorious by Andreas Johnson.
Intro could’ve turned into a bond theme
It’s good but compare it to kings of Leon walls and it couldn’t lace its boots ,,
Genius ! As usual… Thanks for all  Noel, keep going, please.
“When the cold wind blowed”?  Really?
Alot of people in comments saying that Noel just copies other people's songs.  If so easy then why don't u all do it n start a band
Thankyou for the sub text Noel . Little by little took me a while to till i found some sub text which is a real grand song .
Brilliant!
The chief does it again
lame
very moody....classic noel/ thank you for good tune master!
You know this is a quality tune when liam doesnt tweet about it
This song is a masterpiece, welcome back Noel
noelly g manc legend
Wowowowowowowow!!!❤️❤️🤍🤍👍👍
Love the subtle hints to his other songs. "Cast no shadow" and "Hey Now". He also refers to Liam's song "The Morning Sun/Son"
welcome back even if You have always been - one of us -
This song is Noel pretty much giving the finger to the whole idea of a reunion. I didn't realize that Oasis only lasted 15 years, and he's been solo 10 years, already.
Gorgeous.. Feels a bit like Talk Tonight from The Masterplan B Sides album... ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Biblical!
Instant Noel classic.
Trite, banal and middle of the road - Noel is chewing the chewed!
It's a Wonderful Song !! now, i'm waiting for the new album....
I'm all for artists trying to grow etc. but I think Noel lost something during/after WBTM?  This song is mediocre, melody and lyrics seem a little forced.
meh..tooo wishy washy, he was going into really interesting territory with blue moon rising and black star dancing....now he's fallen back on boring ballads,,,,
Magnifico
Love you Cabezon.
The strings at 1:22 till 1:34 look like the strings of glorious by Andreas Johnson innit ?
One of my favourite songs he's done since Oasis, glad he's taken a break from disco pop, at least for now.
これなんだよノエル兄貴。 こういう路線の曲作らせたら世界最強の人。最高。
Decent,Sounds a bit like Andreas Johnsons "glorious"
Finally!!!
this is actually good better than that overrated dead in the water
This man never stops producing tune after tune, I have been in a battle with depression and anxiety issues for longer than I care to remember but he always brings me back from the edge!!!
This music brought me peace. I loved it 💖
Magical Noel. Love it.
I love all the oasis references!
Biblical
This song hit my heart like warm sunshine. God bless you Noel. God bless all you brothers and sisters. Peace to you all! surely!
Where's biblical guy?
So nice song 🙂
Top
I can imagine the acoustic demo is 100 times better
Andreas Johnson Glorious.
Beautiful
Thanks Noel from Japan
Soundtrack of my life since 1994 Noel is like a fine wine just gets better with age, Great song 1.28 james bond theme
❤️🥷
Noel te pusiste la 10 con esta canción.
Best song he's done in ages man. Well up there!
Would be good as a bond theme.
Check out (Audio sunsets men in suits )👍👍👍👍👍
Pretty good.
great music and melody
Huge oasis and noel fan but not feeling this for a first single tbh. I mean it ain't a bad song but personally I find it a bit boring for a first single, was hoping for a more upbeat song.
Biblical!
Something Tells me this was a direct response to Liam Gallaghers One Of Us :)
has anyone noticed that the sky forms a large X (10 in Roman numerals)?
Legend. Chief. Brother!
El puto amo. 👈
Seems to be alot of Oasis in the media over the past week. A tour is obviously coming to Australia.
Biblical
Beautiful 💙
“Doesn’t cast no shadow”
It's amazing after all this time he still is making amazing music. His music has been adding color to my grey world for over 20 years.
"cast no Shadow", "Hey now" and " don't know why"....too many Oasis references in the lyrics...my Heart Is not ready!
What a fuckin tune...
اشو ماكو عرب
Does anyone out there no what that orchestra line is that comes in throughout this beautiful tune
Can we also talk about how cool Noel’s COVER ART is?
ALL I NEED IS NOEL GALLAGHER AND HIS SONGS....................................THE BEST SONGWRITER OF ALL TIME
Great ballad;) Love Noel’s voice with these kind of songs. Dead In The Water is another great one. Also his acoustic versions are epic! Brilliant songwriter! It just makes the world a better place:)
Thank you Noel for the great songs you've magnificently written over the years with OASIS ad NGHFB, including this one.
I don’t catch up much with the Gallagher’s but Oasis came up in my mind then I ought to search and listen to their classic songs. Then I stumble upon this song on the exact day it was released. I’m lucky, and I love the song already after just one listen. A lot of heartwarming comments here.
This is beautiful.
I think noel is underrated lyricist.
GOAT
Would have been better with the brother singing. The first song he's released in years that you could say that
Beautiful. …
To be fair. i will always love The Masterplan no matter how many times you rewrite it. Good job.
I played the live forever solo, with this song back trackin
I love it. Back to the basic noel music, just keep it simple, pure and magical, that's what you're famous for! No more space music please!
ZZZZZZZZZZZ
so good
New National anthem？
lyric scrabble
Okay, I’m not native in English, but this song if the word “lady” would not be in it, I could easily think, that it is about Liam... just think about it...
Counting the days to see you live one More Time in argentina 😍
I like this song.
Gallagher on form, cracking little ballad n it's got the if I had a gun vibe about it
Fazia tempo que eu repetia várias vezes uma música da nova safra do Noel. Sensacional!
This is about Liam somewhere in this with the old song titles
welcome back, its been a while.
Imagine being able to do all he's done with variations of em, g, d, c and a capo - - - legend.
Gracias Noel
Doesn't this look as Noel wrapping up his solo career before... you know what... ?
Incredible!
How is regurgitating the same lyrics over and over again genius? The hook with the girls is good but this guy is taking the mick...
love this song, love this band
Noel is God. Nothing more to say.
Beaut
One of Noel's best.
Love the song, this is the song formula we love to hear from Noel. Totally passed on those over-priced vinyl EP’s. The first two albums that came out, we practically wore the grooves out. The third, played 2-3 times, then never touched it again. However, we love the vibe of this song!🎧
Is a new album coming out ?
Much as a love oasis, if I had to chose which body of work to listen to for the rest of my life... oasis or NGHFB... it would be the latter. Maybe I'm not the carefree youthful tearaway I once was but with age comes knowledge and I know that this is some of the most wonderful music he's ever made.
So much better than that disco shit he was putting out!!
❤
Just because I'm a Noel fan doesn't automatically mean I will unconditionally love everything he does.   And I don't love this.   I didn't Dislike it cos it's not bad,  but it does nothing for me at all.
Noel Trust me it is time to retire
Ladies and Gentlemen: the one and only.... Noeeeelllll Galllagheeeerrrrrr!!!!
tears...love. thank you noel
Love it!!!! 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
THIS SONG IS ABOUT LIAM & NOBODY KNOWS IT 🥳🥳🥳🥳
Chief!! excelent song! thanks for your music! amazing!
Noel Always has this powerful chorus that brings you somewhere else, somewhere green full of coloured birds. 🙏😊
Best in a long time ❤
i like it I've listened to it five times today :)
Beautiful. Top artist.
Great Noel ballad. I’m ready for a new NGHFB album.
Ripping off Andres Johnson -Glorious a little bit
Noel just keeps on getting better
Good shit
Noel I will never stop listening to you or oasis! 😊🥺
Love it! 😎👌
A perfect James bond opening.
うむ、今回も期待に応えてくれた！
An album of these types of melodic tunes next please Noel.
This is mega. Love this
would like to hear Liam sing this song
The mans a legend on top of he’s game again
💙TE AMO NOEL💙
Absolutely love it, love him ❤
"She Taught Me How to Fly" is not on the Best Of. What??
Richard Ashcroft e'ancora super questo mi ha rotto
Perfect way to bookend NGHFBs before Oasis mark 3. Every time I hear a good Noel tune I can't help thinking how amazing it would sound if Liam was singing it.
Andreas Johnson - Glorious
Ah ... Noel back to his peak melodic form. No more of the Paul Weller-wannabe dance crap. This is bliss.
Ma sono tutte uguali basta dopo 30 anni direi che puoi andare in pensione Gallagher
The lyrics gave me chills. Powerful
ok but where’s We’re gonna get there in the end?
Sempre la stessa menata dopo 30 anni basta Gallagher piantala sei ripetitivo
They don’t call him the chief for nowt !
Who's back singing ? Ysée ?
This is why Noel Gallagher is the best songwriter of all time.
Brilliant nice one Noel
Pura rola chingona!!!!!!! 🇲🇽 Salud Chief 🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻
Wow this is sad and beautiful. I'd like to see Oasis, please Noel. I wasn't able to see you because I was born in 2004, someday........
Anyone from India?
“We’re on our way now” to the band reunion......okay, a guy can dream alright
Liam must dream of writing quality like this 👌
Has to be a James Bond song..
Stealing sky sports football music now from a few years back.  Cant remember the bands name. Anyone?  Edit - glorious by andreas Johnson
Again noel? Yes, again.
This song is SUBLIME. Noel is going somewhere else this time.
Love this! What a beautiful tune…some great Oasis links too, but it’s a heartwarming tune
More like this 👍🏻 loved it 1st time i heard it.
I couldn’t thank you enough Noel, for writing songs that can save someone’s life without even knowing that person. You saved mine, a huge thanks to you.
Thumbs up. Another goodie!
Love the vibe of the song, still trying to figure out what it’s about
About time !
The magic is back
Another bullseye for mr gallagher
I'm liking this. It's a bit of the old Noel and a bit of the new.
🍑 .... of a song
Olvide dar like a esta nueva joya . . . Una oportunidad para volver a escuchar.
I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING!!
Back to basic man, thanks
Proof that great artists still exist in this world! Thank you, you godlike genius.
Master at his craft, best song writer of the last 25 years 👏
'Remember what might have been' is a pretty dope line. A bit paradoxical haha
Top draw.
I like this one. Good lyrics and melody.
Really like this
Mannnnnnnn this song !   Undeniably NG at his very very best here.   Best melody maker E V E R
demo?  fuck that.  as with Julian Assange, release it/him NOW!!!!
Muito bom Noel !!! Thanks
I think Oasis was great but, I will just say that the High Flying Birds are the Best band for Noel. He is not only one of the greatest songwriters of all time but a great singer as well. They are his songs and he sings them the best...
Must refrence about 10 oasis songs
The best songwritter of all time !
Mega
This is exactly what I needed after a stressful day at college, a new song from this biblical genius.
Bucking Frilliant.....
"Good luck in the afterlife, I hear the morning sun doesn't cast no shadow." Here's to 10 more years of genius songwriting.
The best singer /songwriter is back. It's a beautiful song
Absolutely beautiful)
Good song, the strings remind me of a top song 🎵 I can’t recall the name  right now
Amazing
Hermoso tema Noel! Saludos desde Paraguay!🙌🏼🇵🇾
Love this song
He’s lost it...
Love it when he mixes some sentences he took from other songs of him
Oasis regresa :(   Noel amo tu voz.  Perú presente! ♥
absolutely incredible
Very disappointed,  sound like Andreas Johnson Glorious 😒
Genius! What a lovely  song! 🖤
You's changing the style of makesongs. Is "dedicating himself" to the style of "Take me away" (your most different song of all ) that he never used much! You now look like an American songmaker.  Is brilliant! EVER! By JD
Boring, I can't beliieve he is the same person who wrote champagne supernova.
What a great tune, reminds me of Alone On The Rope! Can’t wait for the greatest hits!
Great to know that I saw the song that could of got oasis back together 9 hours after it was released.
Great Song.
Just a lovely song by the chief yet again.
So goooood...!!
Help!!!!!  I can't stop listening to this song!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;)
¡¡¡MEEEE ENCAAAANTAAAAA!!! ♥️🎶 I LOVEEEE IIIIIT!!!! 🔝
Beautiful song 🎶
Amazing 👏!!!!
Todo lo que necesitaba. Love from Argentina.
This is unreal
Grazie, amico Noel.
CHIEF
This would be a great James Bond theme song.
Noel is a genius. 👌👌🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🎵🎸🎹
He's written some fucking belters, mind... And this is one of em. 👌
This song makes me sad that I'll NEVER see an Oasis concert or my 6 year old daughter never will who loves Oasis also 😔
Vamos Noel carajo
BÍBLICO
A song written for the ages for all ages Noel I can't wait to hear more we need a new album he will neaver stop, this here it's in his blood, one thing I would like to say is i know it seems to be like there's 2 teams ie. Team Liam or team Noel and as petty as it seems to be if I had to choose a  side if it comes to the music I have to say Noel  but even back in the day as much as I love Liam oasis without Liam would not of been oasis he was the last great rock star and fuckin funny as fuck with it but I also  always liked Noel ever since take me away and sad song and it's better people  and when I see Liam singing these days something just make me feel kinda sad and awkward I can't quite explain it I just don't think his voice has been 100 percent since around the time when i taped the be here now g-mex gig of the telly(brilliant gig it's on u tube) I'm surprised he dident lose it during fade in out , bloody hell he shreds every single note out of that song even Kurt would of been proud , although he wasent too bad when i went to see them for the first and only time at Wembley 2000 on the familiar to millions tour  but after he just seemed to cut his vocal lines short and he still does that unless he plays an intimate gig but it's just too damaged and it's sad this is one of the reasons Noel won't reform cos Liam can't sing for 3 hours straight to a stadium or festival crowd it would be unfair to the punters and to the band cos we all know how much it would mean to Liam and the band and as much as i fuckin adore the roses and enjoyed there comeback I can't see Liam using whatever Ian used on his magic microphone cos I'm sure there was some kinda trickery there , anyway the way i see it is at least the new fans and us old fans being either the madferit or the Noel chin strokers lol still get to hear oasis songs sung by both brothers depending who you dig plus we luckily get a bunch of new music being if your bloody team Liam or team Noel or like myself enjoy Noel immensely as it goes a little deeper with Noel ex. when I was sitting in my room teaching myself guitar from learning oasis songs from them little song books that just had the chord shapes above the lyrics (5.99 each I still have them lol) and all my mates were still on jungle it shaped who I am today music being my passion  , but i also enjoy Liam's albums , if anything it would just be nice for them to make up and I speak from experience my dad and uncle fell out and my dad passed away without ever making amends wich upset my nan so much until her final days ,  but at the end of a long day I hope everyone is safe and happy and enjoying the good music they gave and given us now and then ,✌️👊 peace
Bet some of those lines are about Liam
The song Embrace didn't write... Good one!
I've the feeling he's singing this to Liam, to the "death" of Oasis, and how both Liam and him are now making their lives apart and being successful.
A return to form at last!
A Noel ballad. Suddenly the sadness in the world doesn't seem so bad.
Welcome back Mr. Gallagher
best birthday present
Another classic hit from Sir Noel of Manchester. 🌹🐝 This guy never seems to fail. ✌🏼
I wonder if this is about his friend and comedian Caroline Ahern who sadly died a few years ago?
MY FAVOURITE ARTIST! Best songwriter!
Can anyone else hear Andreas Johnson - Glorious in this tune?
This is good
Suena bien, aun la arma Noel
Biblical
Beautiful song, Noel. Thank you for this!
Noel is the best British songwriter in history. Not just since the nineties, ever. I love the Beatles, Stones, all the greats but Noel Gallagher is really something special and tops the lot in my opinion.
what a brilliant & a beautiful song' this standout' put Noel on high reputation once again!
Why does this seem like its wrote towards liam?
I’ve played this song more than 15 times by now. For me, this is his best work since The Dying Of The Light ad Riverman. Well done, maestro!
Love u Noel - godlike Genius! ♥️
Ye gotta love this tune and the clever way he added two great Oasis tunes from the same album into this song...!! From were gonna get there in the end to were on our way now , Ye gotta listen to the Chief and Soldier On...!! Only true Oasis Fan's will see what I did There...!!
Cos you’ve got the love, you’ve got the love lady 🎶  Reminds me of when I first heard Dying of The Light Noel, brilliant.
I got goosebumps on my soul listening to this. Noel is incomparable! He will always be the best songwriter in my opinion ❤️
Noel back to his roots, good to see, I do like his pop/electronic style but can't beat this
I think Noel need a singer.
Noel Gallagher,  I love you man and thank you for your inspiration and the songs , again you have proven that you are the best songwriter of your generation ❤
Anybody else notice that NOEL drops songs like this at the EXACT moment in our lives when we need them the most? - I for one; really needed this song today. (Gives me chills).
The verse so sounds like that Rihanna and erminen effort. One of the better solo efforts.
Amazing song, right back to the Chasing Yesterday days. Can't help think he sounds like Will Young on the verses.
Oh my goodness what a song!! Love the references to the titles of songs on what’s the story. Welcome back Noel mate brilliant stuff!
Don Noel Gallagher, ¿como cresta lo haces en sacar tan buenos temas? Buenísimo el single
Love it <3
Biblical
Usual stuff, just plods along with no real  chorus again, starts well then nothing 🙃
KOOL
What this image represents for you??
When I hear these ballads I always imagine Noel and Liam casually walk in Manchester, turn a corner and bump each other, then look straight in the eyes and suddenly hugs, making peace... it's a fantasy... but it always makes me cry to think about it. Life is short. You'll never know until someone you care it's gone. We're living in dark times...
Beautiful just like Noel ♡
Less than 1 minute and i had tears in my eyes
The song of the year! Definitely!
beyond biblical
Noels going through his Phil collins moment.
Nostalgic :)
You are my world!! I love you my Poet!!
any else noticed the similarity to glorious by andreas Johnson?
Tremendous tune.
Shy tin tit.      But what would I know.
I read somewhere last night (east coast America) b4 bed it was a proper guitar tune....nope! Was hoping for a rock n roll number, but I dont mind this. Growing on me. I just wanted a verse prechorus chorus solo verse prechorus chorus chorus song.
Justo a tiempo Noel!!!  The "Fucking Genius" ...  Saludos desde Argentina!!!
Noel is the most great songwritter of the last 30 years, a real genius of a generation.
Brought me to tears. He did it again. Seems like there’s no end to his library of songs! Godlike!
👍🏻
yessssss
A mishmash of NGHFB songs combined into one, another slow tempo snoozefest. I'm beginning to give up hope of Noel ever being a Rock n Roll star again and it makes me sad.
Stop being so condescending! This is a fast-studio-track to get yer balls out!
So So bored! C'mon, stop the turtle-clock... There's no need for this right now!!
The Gallagher brothers, soo Lennon and McCartney in the sense Liam brings out a solid gold tune and Noel bats it straight back to him. Keep on keeping on lads, such a joy
애매한데 형
Great Song From A Great Songwriter.
Just what we needed an absolute masterpiece from a legend
Love the melody!  Also love how he used “Hey Now” and “Cast No Shadow” in the lyrics 😄
Noel your still the greatest. But I have to say I'd still love to see oasis live one more time. Platt fields park is waiting for you. Come show manchester what it was like to be mank again.
Hey now & cast no shadow😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 By the way amazing song❤️🇬🇧
You can't get more insipid than that can you Noel ? Catchy overdubed radio filler.
If this song were a person I'd be cheating on my wife right now. What a tune.
Of course this one is for Liam. "I hear The Morning Sun Doesn't Cast No Shadow" Definitely shows the message for Liam in the same style as One Of Us.  Another great song of Our Kid.
A new Noel Gallagher song is always a reason to smile. Keep 'em coming, Chief.
Noel god.. this new song make me cry ❤❤❤
Celestial
I just can't stop listening to this...
Kao-rob form Thailand 🇹🇭❤️
Hey Now, "Meet your maker" (D'You Know What I Mean), Cast No Shadow any other references?
Engraçado que as músicas previsíveis do Noel são mágicas, admiráveis.
Outstanding NG! YES
One of his best tunes from HFB in my opinion
I felt chills!!! Thanks Noel
New content from Noel?? Can’t wait!
Now sheeeeeeeeee's bringing me in, checking me out, making me glorious 🎶
The Chief has spoken!!!!!
Pre ordered 👌
Masterpiece. It required only a more elaborate guitar solo and lauder drums sound by its end
Who’d of thought Andreas Johnson built a time machine and would borrow Noel’s melody for his song , it’s glorious 😉
Long life to king Noel
Was gonna buy it but not gonna now as you keep deleting my comments 😆 Twisting my lemon FB page
This was super neccesary
Very true ballads.  The chief is Back.  It's remind "due destini" of the "Tiromancino" (Tiromancino - Due Destini).
Not bad, but I am still missing the NGHFB' first album times...
Noel+Ballad= the best thing in the fucking world, noel never stop writing amazing songs, he’s my example for ligw
this is a masterpiece bye
Honestly don’t know why people prefer LG to Noel. NG’s stuff is light years ahead. Equal to Oasis.
Thank u Noel. Beautiful music! 🤍
He has written so many good songs over the years, Godlike Genius.... What a legend.... Also, GO CITY !
I dig. It gives me that  Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants b-side era vibe. Love it!!
Love it!
we got the love, we got the lovely song.
Mr. Songwriter
All these years later and Noels still writing Oasis B sides
The greatest songwriter of his generation. Great work Noel!
como siempre, genio total.
Is that for Liam ?
Noel, you’re breaking my heart. In a bad way.
Graciasssss Noellllllllll
🇧🇷 WE WAITING FOR YOU NOEL! BRAZIL LOVE NGHFB,AND THE GALLAGHERS
I'm clapping and I'm crying.
Cast no shadow and hey now. 💕 i love you Noel.
TU VOZ🤩TE AMO
Brilliant, everything Noel ever does is brilliant, fuckin genius 🎸
This is the song I need to get on with my life...
Another great tune noel. Thanks and keep em coming mate.
If we all stop listening to Noel Gallagher it will force him to get Oasis back together again - how good would these songs be if they were being released under the oasis name!!! X
Donde esta la implosión? Pero es buena. No es comercial. Pero si suficientemente comercial para los fans mas aguerridos de The Chief en su "etapa" o faceta solita
This song is pure emotion. He is a genius and hopefully we can all start caring more about each other x
Very Noel chord progression in the opening few bars.
Absolutely pure class.
Sounds like a Travis song
Maybe liam met his maker hopefully it brother love song and there on the way now to bein brothers again for there mums sake in these times life to short
such a masterpiece
Not bad
Mi cumpleaños otra vez
Live forever Noel!
"Making me Glorious" anyone?.......
This speaks to me soo much right now ❤️ Thank you soo much 🆖
Another massively average song by Noel 😴
Beautifull song!!👌👏👏👏👏👏💜
the chief!!!
Too shallow and predictable.
Fucking love this track!!! Proper tune!!!!
I would say Noel is back but the truth is that he never lost it. What a tune
He said we were gonna get there in the end and now we’re on our way.  Stay strong, peeps.  If the genius says so, we should believe in it :)
This is such a James Bond tune
Waiting for the 'BIBLICAL' guy to certify this tune 👌
Am I the only one who thinks that this is a recap of his story? There are many oasis references as "cast no shadow", "hey now"
Yeah like it good song..!!
Decent, but nothing more. 7/10
Beautiful as usual !! But am I the only that seems to recognize " Glorious " by Andreas Johnson in the back ???
You are magic, Noel...🤍
Beautiful! You Keep bringing fantastic songs from the sky. 👌
this is the man we love since ever
Where’s he pinched those strings from ???? I can’t fucking think what song it is ? Help !!!
I fucking love itttttt
'Back the Way We Came' Album Tracklist:   Everybody's On The Run The Death Of You And Me AKA... What A Life! If I Had A Gun... In The Heat Of The Moment Riverman Lock All The Doors The Dying Of The Light Ballad Of The Mighty I We're On Our Way Now Black Star Dancing Holy Mountain A Dream Is All I Need To Get By This Is The Place It's A Beautiful World Blue Moon Rising Dead In The Water (Live) Flying On The Ground
Like Travis, stereophonics and Keane all got together to write an oasis song.
First listen amazing goose bumps. That’s a bit more fucking like it Noel
The Chief is back... Thank fuck for that ❤️
This legend is on the move again hallelujah🙌
Welcome back noel
Just can't listen to your solo stuff .  Struggle to get through a full song.
Good to see Noel bang at it again , good luck in the afterlife people
Andreas Johnson is consulting his lawyers
😎👍
Back with a bang
What Pills he talking about? 🤔
Noel is back. Masterpiece. 👍❤️👑🇬🇧
Another number one single by Noel Gallagher!
Complete rip-off of Glorious by Andreas Johnson. Can never come up with your own ideas
One of the best things he's done.  Great track.
A bit of 'I'm design for life' in there on the strings..
He just did it again ! Love it
Noel Gallagher is my generations, John Lennon.
[Verse 1] Remember what might have been, had to walked you home I said I'll see you later You were living the dream but when the morning come You'd gone meet your maker  [Pre-Chorus] Good luck in the after life I hear the morning sun Doesn't cast no shadow You chose to drift away but look at you now  [Chorus] We're on our way now The truth can be so hard to swallow Hey now, cos you've got the love, you've got the love lady I'm worn out cos with every little trick they try to drag you down You don't know why  [Verse 2] Stood on top of the world and when the cold wind blowed You said thе chill don't matter Having the time of your lifе but when you take those pills Does it make it better ?  [Pre-Chorus] Good luck in the after life I hear the morning sun Doesn't cast no shadow You chose to drift away but look at you now  [Chorus] We're on our way now The truth can be so hard to swallow Hey now, cos you've got the love, you've got the love lady I'm worn out cos with every little trick they try to drag you down You don't know why  [Interlude]  [Chorus] We're on our way now The truth can be so hard to swallow Hey now, cos you've got the love, you've got the love lady I'm worn out cos with every little trick they try to drag you down You don't know why  [Outro] Cos you've got the love, you've got the love lady You've got the love, you've got the love lady
The chief is back everybody!
A little more of the classic Noel sound, love it.
Currently in college listening to this masterpiece, should be preparing for my last project of the academic year but I just had to stop and listen to this, and lord. It did not disappoint, He is such a talented artist and musician it is beautiful just when you I  think he's covered every emotion known in his work over the decades he comes out of the woodwork into the light and shares this beautiful soul reaching song. Peace and love to everyone, I hope you're all doing well! We are nearly through this pandemic just a couple more months people, we can do this, together. :D
Anyone else hear the nod to Andreas Jonsson's "Glorious"?
🖤🖤
Love You Noel. Thanks for all feelings in My Heart 💙
Amazing❤
Forgettable
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷  Lembre-se do que poderia ter sido,  Tive que te acompanhar até em casa,  Eu disse que te vejo mais tarde.  Você estava vivendo o sonho,  Mas quando a manhã chegou, Você foi encontrar com seu criador.  Boa sorte no depois da vida,  eu ouço o sol da manhã,  Não lança nenhuma sombra. Você escolheu se afastar,  Mas olhe para você agora.  Estamos a caminho do agora.  A verdade pode ser tão difícil de engolir Ei agora, porque você tem o amor, você tem a senhora do amor. Estou exausto, com cada pequeno truque que tentam te arrastar para baixo Voce não sabe porque.  Ficou no topo do mundo, E quando o vento frio soprou Você disse que o frio não importa. Teve o melhor momento da sua vida, mas quando você toma essas pílulas, Isso o torna melhor?  Boa sorte no depois da vida, Eu ouço o sol da manhã, Não lança nenhuma sombra, Você escolheu se afastar,  mas olhe para você agora.  Estamos a caminho do agora A verdade pode ser tão difícil de engolir Ei agora, porque você tem amor,  Você tem a senhora do amor. Estou exausto com cada pequeno truque que tentam te arrastar para baixo. Voce não sabe porque.  Ps.  01. "Cast No Shadow" and "Hey Now" - Músicas do Oasis no Whats The Story Morning Glory.
Bag of shite
Thanks Noel
Good tune. Noel doing what he does best, 👍
Great tune
Beautiful xx
I’ve not been a fan of his recent material, I loved his first album, and his second one was pretty good. His third was pretty poor in my opinion. This is back to how I think he should sound, brilliant track 😊
How does this man keep cranking out absolute belters, great song writer
Strings sound like glorious by Andreas Johnson haha
I can't believe he's been putting out amazing music for 30 years.
Epic
Wow I really like this song 🇵🇪
The riff sounds exactly like Glorious from Andreas Johnson
Never understand why so called fans were slagging noel for his current music because he is trying something new and churning out songs like his oasis ones. I didn't take to some of his new songs straight away but listen to them a few times and there amazing.  All artists experiment and try new things like Bowie, Dylan. Iggy to name a few. Noel and oasis inspired me to pick up a guitar and learn it and I thank him for it. All hail the Chief
Just handed my little girl back to her mam this morning which is a heartbreaker in it's own right. Put this on and drove home with tears in my eyes. He seems to write for everyone.
Song had a nice oasis kick to it just hearing the song references were so nice
I also noticed it. Funny. Still a little bit of oasis. Made my day.
biblical
very emotional song!
He's back!
Crackin tune but sort of feels like he tried to get as many Oasis titles in there as he could😆✌🏻
woow
Very nice. Seems like a return to the earlier NGHFB sound. Hope that doesn't mean there won't be any more stuff like Blue Moon Rising and It's A Beautiful World though...
He knows how to make those lovely songs
Good song, not great Kind of disappointed to hear it’s a “Best Of” he’s releasing
This makes it all worthwhile.
I can imagine noel doing this song acoustically infront of 80,000 people and he would move all the crowd.
Seriously?? I was waiting for this😭😭😭
“Cast no shadow” “hey now”
Oh yeah baby
Such a sweet tune! 😍
For me the best song of his out of nowhere is.  Dead In The Water.  Now that was something.
HE IS BACK !!!!! TUNE TUNE TUNE YES 👍  XXXXxxxxxxxxxx
The chorus reminds me of Little By Little
Another brilliant job… cheers Noel Gallagher
Love from Poland 💜
BIBLICAL
The chief has done it again
Wb
Best work in ages 👍🏼
andreas johnson , a copy of glorious 1999

Hello Noel! I am a big Greek fan of yours !!! I love your songs, your music is amazing !!! But please consider the possibility of rebuilding Oasis !!! It would be wonderfull!!! You are both wonderful and if you reunite the world will go crazy with joy !!! As for the new song, I found it very beautiful and melodic! Many hugs from a big fan of yours !!!!!
Chief !
incredible
Who else thinks that Noel is one of the best songwriters of our lifetime?
🙌 Love it Gallagher you can never disappoint
FKIN hell. He’s turned into Phil Collins
Glorious by Andreas johnson anyone?
Nice song Prayer for the dying. Seal.  Just saying
noel thanks for my birthday present. The song is super
I want the dead in the water studio version ...pleaseee
Now we’re talking!
As perfect as always!
Great track
The Chief is back
Love you Noel. Your voice and guitar has been accompanying me for 27 years and every time it's still like the 1st time!
Another beauty
Please gallaghers get back together ♥️
Brilliant!! He's done it again!! 👍🏻
This single and Liam's last album are fucking amazing, imagine if they were back together...
Thank you Noel for another masterpiece! My life is blessed
Yes Noel onions and tomatoes on a horse’s back 👏👏👏💚
Brilliant tune
lots of whats the story morning glory references in this
Avit
Salvas mi vida todo el tiempo, con amor para tus seres queridos, te amo.
Only gripe I have with his song writing as of late is a lot of repeating of common phrases he used for years as if he's running out of things too say. I'm happy that you're still going but..I don't know.. Just sort of a little disappointing.
He's back! 😁 Not a bad tune at all 👌
godly
needs more scissors
Is it available to purchase on vinyl cant find it ????????
A little all you're dreaming of vibe maybe?
Oasis reunion??
Belter of a Tune 🔥 Welcome back Noel 🎶
Noels back
He says Hey Now and Cast No Shadow in it. Makes me happy
Liam Gallagher Army Will Love This One ❤️ because that’s The Real NG No Cosmic Tune
Not bad for a crooner
Beautiful 🤩
Superb yet again.... this man can do no wrong
행님 기다렸습니다.
What a load of rubbish  Time to stop i think Oh dear.......nomore please
Lovely track Nowl ❤
This is just more samy samy boring, please sort your shit out and get your brother back
Temazo Noel 🎸🎵🎶✨
Great song
Much better then the space disco space pop stuff !
The Chief.
There are tones of Andreas Johnson Glorious in this song.
Andreas Johnson Glorious
Class track - Noel you are a musical genius!
Damn this is way better than everything from the last album and the 3 EPs
Load a shite!!!
BEAUTIFUL
THE CHIEF IS BACK!
Someone's woke up grumpy with their grumpy thumbs down... Must be liam 😂
Wow!! I 've loved your songs always. Good vibes from Lima, Peru!!  🤗🤗🙏🙏
An absolute masterpiece
Been balling since I heard this on Zoe. Absolutely beautiful and sums up this year to me.
The Chief is back! Lovely tune. Dig the references to song names past in the lyrics.
one dislike wtf!?
I love Noel but man this sounds like the Song "Glorious" by that Andreus Johnson fellow. (I can't spell his name 🤣)
"cast no shadow" hehe
BIBLICAL
Great tune 👌
Great song and lyrics Noel. Keep them coming mate. Cheers 🎸🎸🎸
Early! Great song 😁
Another quality song - love it 😍😍👏🏻👏🏻
He's so far one of the best songwriters from this generation. I can't imagine how many lives he pulled back from the darkness ..  I was literally one of them. Obrigado Noel!
The only Noel I love is back ❤️
Very middle of the road.
F’n tuneeeeeee!
How far into a fresh album are we Noel?
Just Noel doing what he does best: ballads
😋😄thanks NG
OH MAN
Like every Noel song, give it 3 listens before writing it off. This sounds like one for the ages
Love it!!
Thank you Chief for this great song ❤❤❤
Cast No shadow & Hey Now snuck into the lyrics there 👍
Oh my... Finally...!!
😔😴😴
How many oasis song titles can you get in 1 song
"Oh wow he said cast no shadow in the song, it'll be an Oasis reunion for sure early soon"   Keep(ing) the dream alive ahaha
Sounds really good
Brilliant
Andrea's Johnson Glorious rip off. Lyrics are as poor as Noels written in my opinion.
Liam's voice would smash the granny out of this!
2:57 wall of glass
podra liam?
Maybe i'm reading too much into the lyrics but i'm catching alot of indirect references towards Liam.
Lovely stuff
Not a massive fan of some of his newer stuff but this I really like 👌
Felt like I had woke up in a foggy heaven 🙌
Lovely ❤️
Lovely track.  That said, is anyone else hearing the refrain from Andreas Johnson's "Glorious" in this?
Sounds like he’s talking ab Liam
Aaand he did it again, thank you for your songs Genius.
Great song
Great tune
Is he singing to Liam?
I love this song, and NGHFB. from Japan🇯🇵 with big LOVE
I love it! Great to hear new music from Noel 🤍.
Masterpiece!
ABSOLUTELY NEEDED THIS
You never fail to amaze me, Chief
Imagine Liam singing this! (Got a whole war going on in the replies)
Two WTS?MG references in this song Cast no shadow and Hey Now
Biblical
He’s only gone and done it again. What a guy 💙  Edit: Glorious....
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Class
Godlike genius 🐐
The song sounds like it could have come from the Chasing Yesterday era... which works for me, as that is my fave High Flying Bird album
Great song!! LOVE IT!
love you so much noelie 😭❤️
I love
