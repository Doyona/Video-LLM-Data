Sami USOS
And now that day Sami Zayn dead and Sami uso was born
Sami Zayn Usos lose of the bloodline
I was thereee
Hey from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Sami only stoped the 3rd count he knew Kevin Owens would of beat Roman Reigns but I do reckon he did manipulate his way by helping Jay to win the match
The best match outta this whole trash PPV this was pure gold.
NXT war games is more better
I think Roman Full family are chitter
PG Games 🤣
This Kevin should be destroyed like this .. he deserved nothing
I AM A BIG FAN With roman but now never like roman Roman and team they always winning shortcut cheeting... this is not champ.. who any one supporting roman and his team they also cheaters....
Ko
BEST storytelling in years! 🔥🔥🔥🙌🏼
Best storyline 🙌⚡🔥
Dog gone it, that Darn Sami Zayn!!!!!!!!!!😡😡😡😡
AEW
I'm sick of it that's why I don't watch shows just check high lights are #1
Goes to show Sami did prove his allegiance to Roman and The Bloodline. Jey has nothing else to do but accept Sami's trust. He proved himself.
New game. Take a shot every time someone says storytelling.    Man, I'm hammered.
Reigns has always been saved by one or the other of his stooges, the most lameass wwe storyline ever
Now THAT was funny.  And Roman takes too many falls. I DON'T believe.
Wow
कौन कौन मानता है 💞की माता - पिता के चरणों 🙏में स्वर्ग है  ......🥰
0:12 Pop Up PowerBomb 0:20 Stunner
Sami is family
Sami zayn help roman reigns to win
Kevin owens can dethrone roman reigns without the help of the bloodline
Roman reigns is a cheater person and 3h also,all management help Roman reigns,why roman reigns win and still beacuse cheating, otherwise not have power 3h or roman reigns fight one person without cheating
The day I see Roman reigns win without cheating I will bow to the bloodline cause he is such a loser
Ko pin roman ready
Ref is looking like Sami issued a death threat to his entire family 😂
Sami uso is the most entertaining thing in all wwe right now. The only reason I watch wwe
Bloodline is the best thing to happen to WWE this decade
Jinder mahal vs austine theory
Becky lynch vs iyo sky
Indus sher vs creed brothers
Roman reigns vs Jinder mahal
Everyone knows they don't loss titles Worest scrip by wwe
Totally scripted 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Notice how reighns jumped up for him to catch him
I don’t know why I keep looking for Roman to sell the stunner like the rock by doing a handstand and flip onto his back..but I’m glad Jey finally hug Sami and everyone embrace him into the family
Sami Uso
I really want to see Kevin & Sami as partners once again
What is better than a great wrestling match is a great storytelling match. But when both combine, it’s perfect. PERFECT!
1. kevin owens vs roman at royal rumble 2. samy vs roman at elimanation chamber 3. samy & owens vs the usos for the unified tag team championship at wrestlemania storyline revealed.  mark my words
Ik a lot of little Roman fans are gonna roast me but I honestly don’t care but Kevin Owens kinda owns reigns cause he would’ve beaten 4 times 4 TIMES if it weren’t for someone saving him so Kevin kinda owns him
This didnt feel like War Games at all. It felt like a War 🔥
Sami Zayn will receive a monetary fine from WWE for making contact with an oficial!!!
Sami uso needs to dethrone roman or at least win one of the titles its the only thing that makes sense... he is the most over person right now
Theory🏆 is Champ again 👌. Stay brutal & strictly business! Beware of Cody "The American Nightmare 🇺🇲," watch Macho Man Randy Savage tapes for inspiration. 📺⛽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Es pura mentira la lucha libre wwe nunca pierde siempre con la ayuda de otro

Roman 💚
Roman is one of those wrestlers that you know will win but is still fun to watch
the winner on this war games so predictable
SURVIVOR SIRIES WOR GAMES V2 "5 2022)😀😀
I bet roman will soon get a mullet
Reigns SAVED AGAIN.... 🤭 Only the Sami and Kevin story saved it. 8/10. I can see WWE giving sami a WWE reign down the line.
0:02
As expected... nothing new, same old story.. WWE REMIX KING.. lame
I remember in nxt owens betrayed Sami when he won the title I’d say it’s even
Good Save
Rahul  guwaha
Sami uso😄
Really make Sami superstar of the year, make Roman jelous and little bit scared of his amazing strategic mind, in the end it even looked like that, that Roman was like daam he is dangerous then Roman saw those laying bodies on the floor :D
Perfecto! Thank you WWE for trusting is Sami! I even cried out of joy! :D
I loved the ending and the women what game
When Sami zayne comes to Montreal for the Friday night smackdown and elimination chamber we won't be chanting Sami uso.  We are Canadian and KO and Sami will ruin the bloodline and Sami zayne will become ur undisputed champion in MONTREAL!!!
That's what they always do Brock almost got him Drew almost got him if it wasn't for freaking solo sikoa he needs to face yo face but has to be on on one and no one else Good job Kevin Owens
Sami did what was right for him and the head of table ☝🦅
looser reingns
One of the best details to notice is Sami didn't attack Owens but instead stopped the ref's count
No hit on Kevin. No hit on the ref. Pure babyfaceness.
You cannot deny the storytelling during this match is off the charts
Can we acknowledge how they try to be the rock and stone cold.... and failed horribly.
This was good story telling, but let’s be real. Sami and Owens have one of the biggest on screen love/hate relationships that it’s really not even remotely shocking that Sami would “betray” Owens. Great match, though.
It's not an official Reigns match until we seen the red boxers
Sami 🦸‍♂️ ❤
Game should be without others interference. Idiot Semi Ziyan
Pura "mafia" es la WWE. Lo  están por ganar y siempre interrumpe alguien.
I'm starting to believe Sami could actually be the one to dethrone Roman wtf 😅
I don't really agree with either war games result but this result is a lot more acceptable because of the storytelling
En vrai ça fait longtemps qu'il aurait dû le perdre le titre avec les fois où les usos l'ont sauvé et là c'est Samy zain
ATP if it ain’t Cody, let Sami beat reigns
Bring back WWe now what we see is a group of jokes who cheat week by week year by year and u still call them champions this is so sick the most boring show on T V
Storytelling at It's Finest
Epic
Does that mean jey don't hate zami no more
Román rinhs mamacita con ayuda así cualquiera gana
This was the best storytelling I have ever seen, Sami Zayn was phenomenal
War games are weird and bad pacing, with a cameraman standing in there without moving the whole time blocking way.....they should at least open up abit of the floor ground like hell in a cell instead.... way overcrowded with people just there lying around obviously ~.~
The most A most watched☝️
Sami uso
Samy zayn just showed the biggest respect in wwe
Take a shot for every commment with the word "storytelling"  "....and Welcome to Monday Night Storytelling!"
🔥
Romen teem chiter
And the crowd loved it😁
Roman Reings is a beast but the best of this Wargames match was Kevin Owens in my opinion he was the man of the evening of this match 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The referee could have used his other hand for the three count!
I think they will swerve us and the bloodline will turn on Jey, not Sami.
Did the bloodline really needed this win they can't even take a lost even if their no championship involved
Why does Roman Reigns stay undefeated when he cheats though 🤷‍♂️ !?
Amazing storyline!!!! Masterpiece!!!!!!! Love the bloodline!!!!!
I like the shirt Owens is wearing
Wow I think Sami is gonna get a Daniel Bryan push. He might actually be the perfect candidate to end Roman's streak if it isn't Cody Rhodes who does it.
Roman sucks
Wwe I failing . Wtf was this ppv . Q bunch of no body.  How many more times are you guna bring back Becky or I knw go get Charlet flair again. . Think I'm guna watch aew .
I hate that Kevin Owens uses the stunner.. it just doesn't belong to no one else then stone cold
Amazing ❤❤😮😮❤
Sami Uno 😂
The match was average. But the story in the match the entire story building up to it, the loyalty questioned, sami and opens everything. Made this match amazing and competing to watch. I hope they build a deep story and eventually but the strap on sami
Sami ❤️❤️❤️❤️
We gonna name him Sami USO Y'all !!! ~ Roman Reigns 😎☝❤
Parabens the  bloodline.  Especial Solo e Sami.
What has wrestling become a sport or a tv show ? it pisses me off rn
The reason I was glad that Sami stayed loyal to the Bloodline is that every time he has been loyal to KO, he has been betrayed.
Only thing that sucked was you knew roman wasn't gonna take the pin.
Sami Zayn!
👍👍
0:32 Probability to next match Sammi Zayn VS Kevin Owens
Kevin Owens already foreshadowed Sami being betrayed by Roman. At least twice Roman had an evil look in his eyes around Sami
Shocking. Reings title saved again by his pack of mules. How did anyone know? Oh right anyone could have guessed it would happen. . Has been for 2 yrs now. Dudes a huge L as a champ
این کشتی کج هم شده سیرک چطور داور داره میشماره و یک دفعه میاد داور پا میشه برید باغ‌وحش نگاه کنید با این بازی و داور کسخلتون آمریکایی های دلقک بین
Roman trash
It's the WWE  same o same o BS
Luv this storyline
Sami got my respect
Honestly one of the most entertaining matches I’ve seen in a while. I thought for sure the bloodline implosion was starting last night.
What if Sami was the one to win the royal rumble this year ? That would be amazing storytelling after this
The Bloodline should have taken a loss here.
Why is there pinfalls in war games tf ?? That defeats the whole purpose
I'm sorry but I'm over seeing the bloodline....Time for a new storyline
Just like I've been saying Riegns never wins by himself
والاخر فوزتوا البلودلاين سناريوهات غبية
I'm happy Sami didn't sell out, selling out in anything but products is bad and Sami really do fit in the bloodline. THANKS WWE.....❤️‍🩹
See Vince would have cut this storyline short
Even with the internet and dirt sheets…this actually felt like vintage WWE Storytelling! The whole arc of Sami Zayn and Jey Uso’s relationship has come full circle. I’m calling it right now…Roman will turn on Sami, but The Usos will turn on Roman to have Sami’s back
Was this for the title? If KO would have pinned Reigns would he have got the title? No, so why not build more trust in the Bloodline so Sami can cost Reigns the title for KO later.🤔😧
Well done sami uso!!! 👍🏽❤️
Sami is gold, protect him at all costs🔥💙
Sami broke ko heart on that one maannn
The background yelling JIMMY USO😂
Sami uso
God tier storytelling
Storyline or not….so sick of watching Roman reigns and or anyone else hold a title for 3 yrs and majority of his wins being aided by involving other people rather than fighting solo! So freakin lame!
It just seems very childish now compared to the 2000s.
The helluva kick after looked like a bullet💥🔥
Bloodlıne ☝️☝️☝️☝️
Started out as a comedy bit, now it's the best  thing in wrestling. What a brilliant, brilliant ride by Sami Zayn.
All of you stupid fan's out there saying roman reigns should be dethroned already, ok, well if he is dethroned, who in the lockroom is going to be telling you a story line this fine🤣🤣🤣🤣roman can rule as champion another year and I don't see the bloodline being a boring faction at all Rather a constant top draw for the company. They are just too good and sami just adds that extra factor To make it even that better. I mean take look at that story telling with that match right there. Just keep acknowledging your tribal chief 😤 👌
There will have a winner... And that will be Owens
This was an amazing show last night and this match…chefs kiss…I needed more of the drama!
We all love Sami zayn. Please wwe put some gold on Sami and solo.
The Bloodline ☝️💪
I didn’t agree with The Bloodline getting the win here, they didn’t need it and it was non title. Should have given the win to the Brawling Brutes
Roman Rat! The winning is always  need other people help. 😒
This is not how wwe is i hate sami sayn! This is cheating  i hoped that kevin owens wins but better Luck next time KO!💪💪
What a surprise 🙄🙄🙄
I love sami
Hell Forget Rock vs Roman I think Roman vs Sami should be the Main Event cause think about it after Sami proves his loyalty to the Bloodline and even Jay hug him now Sami got them right where he wants them now he’s the Puppet master pulling the string and imagine the Huge pay off for Sami for him beating Reigns at WM that would be the loudest pop since Dainel Bryan won the Undisputed title at WM 30
Drama show 😏
And once again roman gets saved shock horror
Wish i had a friend like Sami
I basically had chills running down my spine when the crowd started chanting" Sami Uso". Triple H making wrestling great and fun again.
Usually it’s so predictable  Nice to see that  Sami uso is the bloodline  We’ve seen owens and zayn b4  No need for that
Screw sami zayn
Sami uso🤣
SAMI USO
I really hope that Sami eventually gets all of the bloodline to turn on one another and beats Reigns at Wrestlemania next year. In the meantime they can keep on running with the Honorary Uce storyline
Best Ending in Wrestling History🔥
Omo WTF
sami ❤❤❤☝
If fight forever was two wrestlers it would be ko and Sami this goes back WAY WAY WAY further than wwe even the indies
on the christmas special on raw/smackdown the bloodline should turn on sami setting things up for the rumble, on the ppv its owens vs reigns and sami rushes out to help with the brawling brutes costing roman the title and setting things up for the show of shows vs the rock
Sami could've chosen to jump on Owens but he chose to stop the referee instead...
I'm a lil tired of this story. It's become stale. How can Roman's reign as champion mean anything if every single match he about to be pinned then the bloodline intervenes. It's predictable and I'm tired of it. He's been champion to long and it's killing so many story lines on both shows. Roman has become a part timer and he needs to go
I wish Kevin ownes would honestly come up w his OWN MOVE instead of taking stone cold’s signature even if he asked it’s just not the same ….
I like the sami's loyalty but yet again bloodline cheated to retain the titles
Good job Sami smart move bloodline
The Bloodline won against Drew Mclntyre & Kevin Owens & The Brawling Brutes.
WooooW, Like One Stunner could make Roman pinnable
The Storytelling in this War Games match was perfect 😊
His name is Sami Uso.
The “Sami Uso” chants 😂 changing his name needs to be the next move in this epic story
I cried. 😭😭😭
Sammy Uso!
KO also looked strong, like how many times has he had Roman pinned in the past and something went wrong. Even KO sold it like an actual betrayal.
Jey uso is once again feeling ucey! I know sami is being built up, but jey uso could be a great singles competitor, this time with a title!
The ones 🔥🔥
Storytelling off the charts, please someone give Sami zayn his flowers. He’s one of the few superstars of all time who actually DESERVES it. And man one day, he will be a world champion. No more losing streak, let’s build Sami zayn back up!
I think Sammy will be the one to dethrone Roman Reigns. Probably at WrestleMania
The worst stunner lmao
Roman supa5 kik keri sanc
I think triple h end this boring reings hold of titles by Roman reings, but i be in mistake...
Who ever thought that the bloodline will ever lose at least until wrestlemania, i strongly recommend you to rethink again
0:04 that howl never gets old. I like the echo.
Sami uso chants....❤❤
Bro this is the best Sami Zayn we could ask for
The bloodline full of cheating
Love it bloodline and the story telling a one
Storytelling >>> Flips and dives
3 world champions on 1 team but they lose lol ain’t no way
This was one of the greatest matches I have ever seen and the most emotional storytelling inside the cage I have seen since Triple H vs The Undertaker at WM28
Lol so cheap they will drag this Bloodline ish all the way to Wrestlemania
Great story telling match… like the focus that Sami Zayn is getting!
The way they stare at each other lol
So i guess the bloodline is champions until they're old
This guy has just become one of his kind ..Samy uso
Undertaker will always be missed in survivor series.
Cole trying to spin this on Sami turning on his best friend like we all don’t know what Kevin Owens first did to Sami when he won the NXT championship
Sami the MVP of the night. His involvement in the bloodline has been banger after banger after banger. Even the final betrayal will be a banger even though we know it will surely happen but it will be an epic shocker
Disqualified?
Sami winning the belts
What a fight, a lot of emotions really I didn’t expect it at all
Believe me Sami is calculative cz he's waiting on that day he's gona ve the one to betray Roman 🤣🤣🤣
Roman reigns Great good going
Roman reigns awesome best good going
EASY . Sami is going to swerve everyone later down the road . Sami needed the whole bloodline to think he’s an USO for his betrayal plan to work. He couldn’t really do anything since Jay Uso was catching up to his antics . now with this sacrifice he has won Jay Usos Trust . Now that he has Jey Uso no one will be questioning and his plan is going to move forward . May even want the titles for himself or for Owens
I LOVE SAMI USO!
Is Reigns tryna get an underwear deal or does he have one because in virtually every match his undies are exposed
at first months ago i thought sami would have been a great candidate to cost roman his titles against a worthy opponent but after tonight, his character was developed so much that he became a world champion calibre. i think he should be the one who should win the undisputed titles, he totally deserves it.
Kevin Owens Should have Done The Stunner On Sami Zayn For that
very poor PPV as per usual every match was predictable with little to no surprises
Sami gonna turn soon
man i was ready for the sureve. the way it played out was kind of a let down but im also kind of glad we get to see a bit more.
The storytelling of this match was incredible at Survivor Series WarGames 🌙🔴🔵🤺.
Watching Reigns almost get pinned before someone stops the ref has gotten OLD. It's like listening to a comedian use the same punchline for every single joke. Does anybody REALLY watch these title defenses with the thought that Roman Reigns might drop the belt anymore?
@0:10 Reigns jumping on kevin owens shoulders shows how agile he is for a big man. surprising.
Cowords always cheat
I repeat it again, Kevin is better than Roman.
Just when you think the Bloodline storyline is about to run out of steam, they do something like this.  At this point, I almost don't want to see the downfall of the Bloodline.
kevin Owen
Rikishi now needs to acknowledge Sami Uso as one of his sons that's the only thing left
Who knew that the battle between the Bloodline and the Brawling Brutes would serve as the B-plot to the latest chapter of the Sami/KO saga?
So who's going to beat Roman, Rhodes or Zayn?
0:25 Now that's being UCEY
I think that was so Believable because of Sami Zayn is warned Kevin Owens to save Roman Reigns about the war game
Wwe sucks keeping the doucheline unstoppable NEWS FLASH BORING
FTB
This story is getting old and tiring someone just take them titles off him already why is it that the same guys always get them titles and others have to wait 5 ten or more years to even be considered an opportunity
I CANNOT BE THE ONLY FAN that's absolutely DISGUSTED & SICK of seeing EVERYTHING about the dang Usos. GET WITH IT & LET THIS STORYLINE GO FOR FUG SAKE. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THE NO-MORE-SOs
The ending ruined the best show. Does it make sense for Bloodline to win a non-title match?
I was so shocked Sami Zayn says something against Kevin Owens try to save Roman Reigns 👀👀😳🙈🙈😱
Ssmi zany is a good leader he can die for his pple
Samy is hero roman reings
Bloodline didn’t deserve to win wwe needs to end the bloodline gone on way too long
It had to happen, I mean Owens literally killed him in NXT
Another stupid HHH show
Great match guys
Amazing match! I need more of Sami Zayn with the Bloodline.
I haven't watched WWE in a few years so I don't know who the hell this jabroni announcer is who considers stopping a ref from counting to three as "genius". 🙄
Of course now, KO will have to end Sami.
This was an intense WARGAMES! BRO when Jey finally hugged Sami, I had a tear in my eye!  Character development at its finest!  I’m so glad they are keeping the Bloodline together.  This is the most over stable in pro wrestling right now!  Survivor Series WARGAMES was a 9 out of 10 for me!
Sami stops reff hand to count, thats sucks, bloodline won cheating again 👎
So awkward , former tag team partners now enemies. LOL.
Roman Reigns needs to lose the championship titles I'm sick of him being champion it's got very old and boring
Wwe stole aew double rings? Lol
Kevin Owens had Roman Reigns beat that damn Sami Zayn had to interfere with the match
The greatest match of the night loved Sami showing his loyalty and saving jey.
Sami uso 🤙😎
as usual they won by cheating but … now it's just a show
Ko had to forget his gear
What goes around comes around Kevin Owens turned his back on Sami Zayn years ago in NXT and tonight it came back to haunt him. Story telling at its best it doesn’t get any better then this!!!
The drama, the storytelling during the match was amazing and that beautiful ending. Sami Zayn is gold!
Amazing storyline.
This is storytelling at it best The build up is superb It's been a fun ride  This is unimaginably Ucey
Owens with a Dusty Rhodes tribute shirt
Who won?
Bro this was top tier… but I was laughing so hard when solo went out wrecking everyone and everything and Roman was locked in the cage looking like a proud dad😂😂😂
They literally had to steal aews two ring idea wow
I like it just think I like the survivor series without the cage
@peacock @wwe glad I had Spanish version to finish war games because you all cut the cord half way through the match on me only was able to watch Espanol version for last 20 minutes. @peacok you suck hope you cut Superbowl at the last 10 minutes of the game haha that will piss a lot of fans off like you pissed me off tonight @peacock @wwe @comcast @bullshittv
sami uso
man of the match : Sami Zayn .
Sami sayn will be the one who takes the tittle/s from Roman reigns
Stop recycling comments.
👎🏾👎🏾
This is never gonna end Triple H you need to STOP pushing to much Roman because people gonna get bored and more bored
All the bots in the comments talking about the “storyline”
Sami uso! coming in clutch
10/10 match. Storyline and very entertaining!!!
they BETTER rename him to Sami Uso on SD next week
WWE really does think fans are stupid 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ ref could actually have ended the match! His hand doesn’t have to hit the mat after 2 lol omg
Sami Zayn saved Roman reigns from being pinned after 3 Years
I said it before allow Zayn to be comfortable and he'll deliver......story telling at its finest.....🔥
Sami save the  day he Bloodline  all the  way
W Triple H
Great match and advancement of the long term story. Jay embracing Sami was the moment I damn sure was not expecting!
Sami Zayn is showing his true colors betraying BFF and making an alliance with his new mentor
Pop , when Sammi turns will be Seismic.
There's still life in this Sami Zayn stuff, so you don't have the Bloodline turn on Sami or vice versa.
At this point Sami is the guy. Cody's story works with anyone else as champion, Sami (and everyone else in this story) is killing it and Sami beating someone else for the championships doesn't work. It's unfortunate Cody got injured but it happened and Sami seized the opportunity that opened up.
This was an amazing match with spectacular storytelling! I can't wait to see how it continues.
Roman Reign ooooahhhh is cringe
He didn't betray KO. KO was just in his way to his family. The Bloodline.👆
He Could Still Count To Three Just Use The Other Hand
Between you and me...I cried a little...
The storytelling is incredible. Love it.
Sami made the right choice, Bloodline forever!   Also Kevin getting absolutely destroyed was f’ing great 😂 I enjoyed that
Sami Uso: I will save my Tribal Chief at all cost. Sami Zayn: No one pin the Tribal Chief...except Me!!! Dolph Ziggler: It should have be Me!!!
This match was pretty boring in general but the storyline in the match itself was top notch!
If they're still gonna lose to The Bloodline then what's the point of this so-called advantage matches at the first place?  I mean sure, without it then there's no Wargames match.  But I think this Wargames matches would be better off on NXT unless there's no more champion versus champion matches at Survivor Series because that might make it even twice as worst.☝️😀😅
Legendary Match Tonight!!🔥🐐🐐🙌🙏🙏💎💎❤️❤️
Sami wants to be the one to defeat Roman, not you Kevin
You know, I am kinda happy that Sami didn't betray the bloodline.  I mean, I was hoping that Sami would reunite with KO sure, but, there are still something missing in there.  However, now, Sami won Jey's respect. Everything is in place. The pieces are now connected.  The words "Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer" is there.
catch the refree hand no 3 match
This was a great storyline here during this match between Sami and KO. Sami showed his loyalty in this match tonight, turning on KO and proving Roman he's staying with The Bloodline. What a storyline this has been so far. Sami talking to himself in his head when he attacked KO saying "Sorry, Kevin, but this is for your own good. I have a new home now."
Sami Zayn is awesome
Yes sir 👏🙌 the Bloodline won Wargames ☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝☝
The choreography was really bad this PPV.
Wwe is a Joke now it’s not like WWE of 2006-2012 . It’s pretty Obvious Roman reigns can’t defeat Kevin Owens so let them  give Kevin the title match and see if he won’t beat the Tribal piece of thrash as Drew would say 😂😂😂
Sami and the bloodline. Don’t mess this story up guys.
That ending was unexpected, this is similar to how Dominik betrayed Rey at Clash of The Castle. Storytelling on another level I must say.
I was crying when reigns huged Sami I am so happy for him and in my opinion he is the number star right now out of Roman I hope he gets a title win and run before he retired
getting fkg super stale and bored that wwe kept bloodline and roman winning again time after time. Guess triple h is still vince's puppet and lap dog
Reminds me of episode III. He has truly become Darth Sami Uso :)
Love the tribute to Rock vs Austin when KO and Roman were having a stare down. This match was awesome storytelling, just like that feud between Rock and Austin was back then!
sami zayn v reigns at wm 39 🙂☺️
The Storytelling in this Match was Absolutely Amazing! One of the Highlights in the show!
Why sami why?
Why am I not surprised?  I really want to believe that McIntyre, KO and The Brawling Brutes will win.  But it'd seem that Sami Zayn's loyalty is more useful for The Bloodline then we thought.😅😔🤔
Bored
This match was just incredible 100/10
That ending sucked.  They had a chance to throw us a curve ball with the bloodline losing, and they didn't.  Reigns matches are always so predictable, and it's gotten old. I wish they'd take chances and do surprising stuff again.
What a plot!!!
I can't believe ppl really saying the bloodline getting boring
One of the best finishes in recent history...Sami proved himself to the bloodline but you can tell he didn't enjoy doing what he did. We all expected the bloodline to turn on Sami but now the seeds are there for Sami to turn on them instead. Maybe...honestly I have no idea where this is going and that's the best kind of story.
This is pure storyline
Screw Roman!
Watch The Bloodline turn on Sami next Friday.
This clip and Jey Uso's hug proves that Sami Uso BELONGS in the Bloodline!
Me *looks at Sami on top of the referee in the thumbnail*  I don't even know if that's PG!
Steel cage matches with no bleeding  only in the modern day PG WWE. If you really want to see WarGames watch the old NWA WarGames.
I can here Sami uso chants
The storytelling of this match is to pure perfection. I can’t see anything in the future currently topping that storytelling. An incredible match in itself too.
This storytelling feud between KO & Sami never gets old.
Besides NXT, is this the first time WWE brought back a WarGames match since WCW ended?
This is ELITE!!!! storytelling
Match of the year by far🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥲
Sami's gonna win the Rumble isnt he?
But in a way Kevin did betray Sami lots of times
I havent watched wwe in a while can someone explain the roman reigns and sami zayn storyline pls?
The storytelling and the match itself was just wonderful. One of the highlights of the show imo
SPOILER: AS ALWAYS ANA AGAIN THE BLOODLINE WON.....as predictable wwe is
Sami saved this war games and now finally got accepted in the bloodline
The thumbnail looks like Sami pinned the reff and he just kicked out 🤣
One of the best storylines going rn it’s really going to be sad when The Bloodline turns on Sami.
This isn't the Match. This was a war. A downright war is what that is.
"Sami Uso saves Roman Reigns inside WarGames" Sami is part ogmf the Bloodline. Get used to it.
Roman was bout to be pinned if it wasn't for Sami
Sami Zayn is finally getting the storylines and love he deserves. I've loved him since his feud with Cesaro in NXT.
Honestly expected bloodline to win but kind of getting tired of them even with Sami it just feels like it’s run its course and there needs to be a change idk what it is but something has to happen
this match was not upto the mark
Sami Zayn prevents the referee to countdown for Kevin Owens and the Brawling Brutes chance of victory to save Roman Reigns in 0:25. In the end, it never ends because of the Bloodline.  Like Jim Ross says evil woman is Jezebel, I say Roman Reigns is Lucifer as a evil man. 😠.
The storytelling in this was top tier, I am glad that it's still continuing as it is truly the best storyline in the WWE at the moment.
Sami proved his loyalty tonight!
This wasn’t a normal war games match. This was a storytelling at its peak with Sami Zayn showing his loyalty to the bloodline.
9/10 ppv
P
Let’s go bloodline😊
The whole world is gonna explode the day Sami destroys the Bloodline from the inside!
