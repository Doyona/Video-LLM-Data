Is anyone else finding Goldbridge really fucking irritating lately ?
I’d rather keep pogba than sign Varane tbh
I find it so ironic that he called PSG a retirement team but Man United literally signed PSG's 34 year old striker in Cavani. XD

You are so good Mark, thoroughly enjoyed that Arsenal banter 😂
Mr shouty
Somebody clip him calling Ben White shite and him having a hard on for Varane because would not surprise me if it came back to haunt him as usual 😂
If Sweden win the Euros will we drop Lindelof and replace him with an expensive ageing French player who just lost to Switzerland?
Mark, you have to set fine levels for Arsenal fans chatting here, the more annoying the higher the subscription fee,
I think if we get varrane pogba will stay
I’m sorry but all this Rice will choose Chelsea because he supports them is bollocks. Luke Shaw and Sancho supported Chelsea as kids and now they’re United players. He walks straight into the midfield and is playing with Paul Pogba (contract dependent) and Bruno Fernandes. Would he really get into the Chelsea midfield with Jorginho, Kanté, Kovacic and Havertz? I’m my opinion no. For his career and ambitions, he has to join United
Why would Real Madrid let a defender go if he's one of the best in the world when Ramos has left to make things worse??
Sell Pogba break the bank for Grealish
Get rid of Pogba
Pogba MUST go pleeeeease
Varane 90 percent club lets go!!!!
Improvement on what United have, but the fact no one else and Madrid don’t want him speaks volumes.   People in Spain know he’s not the player he was. I remember Guilleme talking about it when he was poor against City
Should just release Mata on a free, what is point in giving him a new contract. He wont play and we pay a salary and next year no one will buy him.  Just let him go!
Definitely need to concentrate on our defence and midfield varane is a must and rice then we can say that was a great window
You don’t think Lingard wants to go to West Ham? What?
How do we elevate the importance of a top class CDM to Ole and the decision makers? Bissouma surely wouldn’t break the bank for United.
West Ham value rice at 100 million I’m done!
Varane please man make it happen
Mark, RM is not Manchester United......Perez rules......he is a one man wrecking crew......decisions are made in hours......so it is possible!
Think we need to be realistic unless we feed off transfer drama..best united look elsewhere.. Madrid is a world class club they just lost Ramos why would they let Varane go..that's impossible it would have been the worst move in football history..
Sorry i meant £750 million over 10 years from our Addidas sponsorship!!!
I THINK POGBA WILL STAY at United.  You said only PSG realistically could get him. But even PSG probably won't be able to afford him, seeing as they already gave massive contracts to Donnarouma, Wijnaldum, probably giving big wages to Ramos and paid a lot to get Hakimi and they already have Neymar and Mbappe on their books.
again with that Rice is a better player than what we have.. he is NOT... saying that Rice is an upgrade fron fred og mct is like saying that Lingard is better than bruno,,,, Rice is a joke of a player..it like having a drunk moose walking about in midtfield..playing him next to Pogba will not work and hopefully chelsea will sign Rice soon so we dont have to hear about this player again
Juventus is also interested in Locatelli. What about goretzka?
Rice is nowhere near £60 million's worth of player. There are far better CDMs, like Zakaria, who are clearly better.
GET VERANE IN and then get Yves Bissouma
Fred and Mctominay aren’t great but Oriol Romeu is not better than them ahahaha
Varane would be perfect it’s what we need for maguire to we need the best maguire we can get but we can’t forget we need a dm for pogba to thrive
Hearing MG talking about Varane, I just realised how much I am happy for Sancho deal to be finally over. A year of this 💩 omg! It’s over…it’s over!!!
Manchester united just announced jadon sancho
Can we not sell Jones to Arsenal?????? We did it with Mickel Silvestra!!!! I think they would buy if we told them 10 million in bit coin!!!
The 100% club
rice is overrated. id rather get camavinga to pair with pogba in midfield.
"We're going for varane while you go for ben shite"  damn that's gonna be clipped when our crap board sign mings  😭
Varane saga commences! ETA 400 days till the transfer is completed. Stay patient fellas we will get him next august!
Closer than close? Or just close? I'm confused!🤣🤣🤣
ole will play sancho at left and sell pogba and martial.
Pogba will let his contract run out and he will leave...
Varane partnering Maguire would be solid enough for United to not need a CDM or even need to use a CDM position.
If rice was still Irish he'd be worth 20 mil
Keep seeing varane wants like 400k a week to sign if that’s the case defo need alternative
Varane would be an unreal signing - easily top 5 centre back in the world and sends out a massive statement. Just need a CDM after him then we’re ready for next season 😎
Put Matic and Fred up for release and buy a new CDM (add Andreas and others to the list)
With Sancho in what will happen to James, Martial, Amad...
Mata is a great professional but with due respect release him and fill the place with youth product
If we get varane and keep pogba. We could be contenders for the prem.
Glad to hear you finally admit that ole has been backed a lot more than any of the other managers and had better options at the club coming in
Just think varane and maguire  in defence.
I love Sancho deal, but Varane deal would make me so very happy
The best signing Man United can make this summer is a NEW manager.
Ole thinks Mctominay is good enough to play cdm based on the Europa League Final.
I dont understand why a world class center back is not linked to any other club...
Dealing with Real won't be easy...but he would be an absolutely great signing...he would even make fridge better
Man united news
whens ronaldo coming back
I feel Neves is the true Carrick replacement we needed for so long, as Carrick was a CM(later turned DM and even CB at times), controls the game, good passing, good set pieces, long shot merchant, cheap, makes instant improvement to the team.
Varane?? Im still ole out
Ole hasn’t signed his new deal yet??
How can Ole think we don't need a cdm? How deluded is he? Get rid of him!
If we can't get a 6 I would give garner a chance
Varane is staying at madrid watch what happens he will sign a new contract at madrid
Still need a CDM, it’s the obvious void in our quality across the field.
Rice?
If we get Varana and Bissouma should we challenge for a title?
No offer for verane - Madrid to offer a new contract despite psg ready to make an offer… not sure how a deal is close ?
"We're talking about Varane, they're talking about BEN SHITE" Lmaooo
Would rather cinivanga than rice all day long.🤌🤌🤌🙏
In reality we haven't even started talking to Real Madrid yet...
No Sancho in the video title after a long time !
Signing Raphael Varane will help us convince Paul Pogba to sign a contract extension!!
Mark rice is overhyped he is a good player but not a good ball player he cannot pass a ball like fred we should go for one who could pass long balls. It would be koopminers or locatelli.
I would have love to see Axel in that role as a CDM training with Matic working on his short, mid, and long range passing this summer, his positioning as a CDM and the responsibilities of a CDM then just loan him out. He probably a better passer than Fred as same pace and stronger than mctoninay.
never did speak about that RB
Arsenal are living rent free in Mark’s head lmao
United are getting players without competition. It's impressive
If we get Varane, then let’s get a CDM, Bissouma  or Neves would be a good buy !!
PSG has also already bought Wijnaldum as well. We can keep Pogba but he will run down his contract. Best case scenario is us extending Pogba’s contract.. but it’s unlikely.
Palhinha will be a great dmf option for us, sign him
Pogba/varetti swap??
Varane should be the highest priority on United's transfer list.  Varane is probably the second best CB in the world right now and he is used to having a slow partner.  Real class centerbacks have been extremely rare in the last 10 years.  Definitely worth the risk.
If we actually sign varane this quick I would be rlly surprised, and maybe “maybe “ things will change but I don’t see us getting varane and a cdm, I’d love Palhinha
Soooo many commercials to watch this video
Make MAG-ANE happen!
Who's the CDM for France (the player that gets the ball off the back four and dictates the play) that makes Pogba shine so much? This obsession needs to stop. Sometimes even Pogba or Griezman drop deep to get the ball and dictatate play. Kante doesn't do that. All we need is for Mctominay to defend aggressively in front of the back four and give Pogba the freedom to shine.
We won’t get Varanasi this year if at all. This sounds like Bruno and Sancho. Get us excited then the big let down
Varane is class. I can’t understand why kimpembe started instead of konate,kounde or upamecano.
Mark get back the transfer meter thing back up there
we just paid basically same price as arsenal did for pepe and we got sancho 😅🙈
ESPN is garbage
You wish you would get Varane 😂😂😂😂😂
Not. Playing with Maguire. Or linderlof.
Do I dare get happy again
I feel like varane is going to do a Ramos
If Varane stays then we should try to get Militao from Real Madrid because Varane would start next to Alaba leaving Militao out
FINGER OUT & GET VARANE FOLLOWED BY CAMAVINGA, SELL THE DEADWOOD JONES ETC, TOP SUMMER, GGMU & THE REDS GO MARCHING ON ON ON✊
Varane would be a really good signing, a player who is in his prime, and has won a lot of big trophies with one of the biggest clubs in world football.
Obviously Zlatan is the second coming.  Varane would be great, hopefully can do well in the PL
Could see Zidane ending up at PSG anyway. Pogba would be happy to move there
Lindelof and Baily 😀💪 lord for us .. they are enough for us.. give them opportunity and trust
If we signed a CDM do you think Pogba would sign a new contract? I think Raiola would still encourage Pogba not to sign.
Il love it if Mctominey is sold
Forget Varane. Get Ben White!
Knowing Pogbas meddling agent, he probably wants his commission which usually comes with a transfer fee or signing on fee for a free agent ( like Cavani's agent got 10 mill) I wouldn't be surprised if he runs his contract down becomes a free agent then has the audacity to try and resign for Man U for his agents fee. Unless they get a cut if a mew contract 🤷🏻‍♂️
Really doubt Varane is coming, especially if Pogba is leaving... you either get both or none... I would rather sign a CM, CDM and a CB than waste time.
With sancho and if we get varane pogba would be keen to sign then we bring in a cdm and we can dream
Magane... or Vaguire... 🤔
Varane and tchouameni, gway with rice, were not getting him and he's not worth the price
If 'somehow' Lidelof could react like Shaw did...we could end up with fantastic depth in defence if Tuanzebe stays and we get a backup right back....CDM over everything..Varane too, of course!
At this point it might be best for Pogba to go. Seems like he wants to leave, he could leave for free next summer, a new and improved contract is ridiculous financially.
tmr will be varane transfer blow
We need varane, casemiro and jan oblak
To me if ole gets a CB and Sancho that means he would've been backed cause it's very clear that he likes Fred and Mctominay and he doesn't see them has a big problem so
Ole fails next season he has to go
Sell Fred and Mctominay and buy a good CDM its not rocket science
Everyone have a look at MUFCMPB latest tweet
I’d love it if pogba leaves. Haven’t wanted him since he said he wanted to leave and start a new chapter in his career.
If we can get Varane and give Luke Shaw an improved contract, our defence will be set for years to come.
If you think varanne is a bad signing because of the Euros, what do you say about kalvin Phillips being more important than Declan rice on the England squad? Should kalvin Phillips be United's target?
100% club 😂
Why not fucking sell Fred and McTominay and buy descent players.  Also why not sell Matic and let Mata go?  ffs
Ramos is better than Varane. And he’s free just have to pay his wages. United are stupid.
Hilarious. Ben Shaite. Mark absolute banter 😂😂😂😂😂
If we get Varane and a decent CDM my God
Two world class deals in the first few weeks of a transfer window? Surely not?
I say if Pogba wants to stay, keep him.
honestly we cant judge him by the euros game but he will be an impacting player for us and thats what we need
I think rice is decent but he’s so overrated, people talk as if he’s prime Kante 😂
You mentioned winners , bruno isn’t a winner either
Pep spent a billion on defenders alone
As long as we get too 4 he won’t go. But we won’t win anything while pep and Klopp manage in England
We need Saul Niguez as CDM
Even with Sancho, Varane & world class CDM (hopefully); Pogba going out - we are realistically fighting for 4th place in PL.
Three things are certain in life: - Death - Taxes - Mark taking the piss out of Arsenal
As we edge closer to possibly signing Varane im seeing all of the rival fans talk about how "overrated" he is lol. Its as if he wasnt a champions league and world cup winner because he didnt perform for a couple of euro games at most
tbh I don't want varane would prefer kounde
Sancho,varane and a top class cDm would be a good summer ngl
I’d be more hyped about us singing varane because we all expected to sign Sancho since last summer whereas we still don’t know if we’re going to sign varane or not.
Nonsence. P s g want him and other clubs to
You can't say we are not close the truth is we could Be close to a agreement with his representatives and once we have agreed the deal with him and the we go to Madrid
Varane + Rice + Sancho = Premier league title coming back home💯
I wouldn't think twice about Paul Paul Pogba; he has to go. One year left on his contract and he doesn't look like signing an extension so why bother? Get Varane in asap, sell Pogba and then try to do the Camavinga deal.
We should got for Varane and Kelvin Phillips
Sancho will want to prove a point to pep and ofcourse southgate
Varane most wanted man at red part of Manchester
The issue with the CDM is we are acting like it is Utd who dont want one, it is Ole.  We need to stop saying Utd dont want one and be clear it is Ole. Ole wanted Maguire no matter what - we broke the world record for him for Ole.  Ole wanted Sancho - we all knew it we all knew the club tried and finally signed him  We are not really hearing anything about really wanting a CDM that is on Ole. Not the club.
Even with sancho varane and a cdm, I still think we're a few squad signings away from seriously challenging for everything.
yeah that's the point utd have spent a billion and wasted it. City have spent a little more over the same period and done wisely
Varane may be next
We need to sign Varane. Sign a quality CDM and keep Pogba. Sell Matic, Mata, Lingard, Jones, Dan James
Varane. Neves and ronaldo would be perfect
Do you think Greenwood becomes Sanchos understudy this season or does he share the no9 role with Cavani?
AWB x Varane x Maguire x Shaw 😌
It is a good marriage 🥰
If Varane happens then United need to seriously do what they can to keep Pogba .
If you want to really understand the importance of a CDM,take the UCL final as an example. Rodri and Fernandinho's exclusion cost Pep the title. It's not rocket science, specialist CDM is not a luxury,it's a necessity
Marquinhos would be crazy as wel but i dont think hè wants te leave psg
Why say varane deal close on title?????  Then say on the video it’s not close 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
Varane close! Thumbnail.. 5 mins in.. what kind of idiot thinks varane is close? 🤔🤔🙄
Were close!!! Cant wait for him to sign next summer 🥳🥳
It would be a great signing. But you are claiming other media is hyping up things that is not true and yet your doing it yourself. " be very careful to say varane is close, it is not close. Maybe 30%" and yet your headline is Varane Close .. 🤔Funny thing is that if he never sign you will say "I told you so". If he sign you will say "I said so all along, I told you .."😆 So yes you are very good at what you do and I will continue to watch.
Hey Mark
Make Varane happen. Simple!
United need cdm and rb,not cb
got the Sancho song already!! OOH OOH OOH ITS MAGIC.... YOU KNOOOWW... HIS NAME IS JADON SANCHOOOO.. ITS MAGIC... YOU KNOOOOWW HE'S OUR NUMBER **, ITS SANCHOOOOO
Varane has to come for us to challenge for anything next season especially as teams will have more rest in between games!
If we lose pogba I dont see how this transfer window will be a success.. our midfield is already depressing as is.
In a day or so, "Varane signs improved Madrid offer!"  Having seen his comedy routine against the Swiss, I won't be disappointed!  France shipped goals all over the place, esp through the middle, in the Euros. That was with Kante protecting them.  You think he might be a wee bit twitchy with McFred faffing about like a crippled crab in front of him?!!
Big rumors about cavani going to Roma with Jose Any truth to this?
If we get varane Nd a cdm plus sancho the league is dead
JIM WHITE, SKY SPORTS!
Mark.  Messi is a free agent.
We need a left footed center back not Varrane...
Zidane is waiting for France..
Varane would be ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE MARK
If Locatelli is available then why don't we go in for him
who was mark talking bout from aftv? what happened?
Varane > Torres... Everyday 🙏
You know what’s funny is that yes we threw the europa league but surely finishing 2nd in the league makes us the 2nd best team in England
Haaland must be upset lol
"We're not arsenal..."😂😂 killed me
Sancho and AWB might be the best all round Offensive/Defensive Right side in the world
Sancho varane camavinga 21 is coming
People are overestimating Liverpool and Chelsea. Liverpool have several players that will be recovering from injury and will probably suffer from burnout since a lot of their players have been playing for a few seasons in a row non stop. Chelsea have a track record of not spending very well after winning a big trophy like after they won the PL in 2017 they barely signed anyone significant. But if they do spend well they could be a threat but that doesn’t mean they will be.
Am I the only one who thinks the only way we will see Varane in a United top is if we play football manager or go to sleep and dream about it 🤣
God I hope we get varane
A
