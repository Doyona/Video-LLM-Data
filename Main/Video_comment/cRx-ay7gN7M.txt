She's gorgeous but OMG she speaks too muuuuuch so annoying 😵‍💫
5:20 I think it was the moment, she looks stunning ✨
Big thumbs up for this one.
Love how authentic this feels.
Love Kendall
The effort you put into this shows.
This was relaxing to watch.
I m Kendall Jenner fan's lovers 💞🌹 ever
This had me hooked the whole time.
I made it in my life without the need to show out my nipples. So, what does the creative industry shows to the world ? That creative industry are for bimbos ... Sad 😢
Super informative, learned a lot.
She’s smokin hot 😅❤😅
Beauty lies in people's eye's and evil thoughts in their mind's
I didn’t know I needed this until now.
I agree with the comment about "the normal voice", I watched the same life book with Kylie and couldn’t take her fake voice.
increase your business🇺🇸 mam
This was such a smooth presentation.
Such a positive vibe here.
Hi Kendall, when are you marry?
I laughed way too hard at this.
This deserves more views.
❤❤❤u my love❤❤❤
I’m sending this to everyone I know.
Hello Kendall Jenner love you 💞 I m come back lovers long time comes way
Which one was the funniest for you?
So funny, love it!
This was short but valuable.

Super fun video.
Did anyone else rewind that part?

Get me past security!!!!
I really do hate you 😂❤
I really like herself podcasts, and any americans speak faster than  they are neck and neck
If you bring me back, I'll tell you what kind of curse have you gotten yourself into.

i love how she speaks highly of Kim
The icing on the cake was when she said :” I am not perfect nor am I ever going to be “ amazing statement ! She’s an amazing individual
Please
Peace Salam shalom meal
Her Givenchy Met Gala dress is my fav.
Hi Kendall Jenner I'm a big fan and I think you are so beautiful and you are a sweetheart ❤

I love you. Such a beautiful women.

Most beautiful girl in the world 🌎 ❤
She was so pretty with her original nose
So poor thing, some of the ads that Singapore places over American women who aren't blonde and white,  tells me how the digital constellation actually works thru media buys. That is all. All this hoopla and that is all that they've got.  So clearly, the paperwork constellation is where the real story is. Can't wait to see what Elon finds out.
you had so many outfits and you choose these? do better

Kendall
A so beautiful face
I love how she practices self love/compassion, self care, and and self forgiveness when talking about the past. Makes it seem she's a pretty assertive person regardless of her mistakes she's been put through and demonstrates some kindness in a more abundant version of herself.
I really love Kendall Jenner 😊😊
Kendall is so beautiful and inspired during when she was with devin booker
A queen is Kendall 👑👸🇻🇪
She is incredibly personable. Carries herself beautifully. ❤️
Oh girl, you are beautiful in all situations✨
👌🫠
ｉ love her😢😢so nice
I want to talk to you personally and to look at the situation, not you, I've been looking for three months and in the end I hung up because of that and they ripped me off, they took my money for a fan page in Serbia and cheated me big time
Love kendall shes so simpel shes my favorite model
you'll never hold a camndle next to the hadid sisters
you are the worst model i've ever seen
It's crazy that since she launched her tequila brand, she mentions 'having drinks,' 'getting drunk,' or 'tequila' whenever she can, while before that, I don't think she drank that much, just like Kim... But it seems to have become fun to promote drinking alcohol for their business and for young people ( her base fan)
EMBASSY
First kylie did surgeries to start looking like Kendall. kylie is trying so hard to be Kendall and I find that really weird. kylie is sneaky and manipulative
Some of the comments are really appalling. Anyone can see she is true catwalk model material and naturally beautiful too. There are loons suggesting she's had surgery to try and emulate African American facial features. She seems genuinely down to earth in my opinion.
l miss you angel
kylie and kendall siblings relationship is by far the most relatable, honest and sweet siblings relationship on tv. they fight, hated one another envied one another but at the same time support and love each other.
you of  just for you love ❤❤🇮🇩
she always has to mention that she's "such a tomboy at heart" lmfao
Cupid needs a sugar momma lol ..
Beautiful ❤❤
I have always loved her personality.
No wonder you are my favorite we are scorpions ❤❤❤❤❤
I find it odd how she talks about herself in third person. I have never done that. I wonder what causes that? Disassociation?
The way she kept on saying "my sister kim"... So cute❤😂

I'm a big fan. I think I'm already in big love. ❤ Thomas Micus.
Que como te fuiste con las Jenner pregunta mamá.Eres la hija más chica de la familia Hadid.
If possible, JUICY should find me the 1st and the most beautiful amongst the Kendalls. I met her twice around 10th to 24th OCTOBER,2018 in AACHEN, around the shops opposite to MAA HAPPY'S house,closer to the bus stop. I think she is about 21½ now.
The way she talks and describes her outfits and loved ones seems fine to me. I don't know why people say she gives 'mean girl vibes'. And I absolutely love all of her outfits. She is gorgeous.
😂😂😂 cuál es la política de tu mamá. Cómo se construye la riqueza para que no te enmarrane con la olanzapina y el Valproato de magnesio.
Saw the season 5 trailer today and yeah, she's definitely a nice person to be around.
🖤xe 👑🌠
BORED TO DEATH. She always looks the same. One note model. BORING! BORING! BORING!

What does the ending mean where she writes Hags?

Husband 'at the time' 😂😂😂😂 Just Kim things
i can se khloe in her. wow..
Never accept a Kindle 😅
Kkendall ❤
I love Kendal Jenner
I don’t like the Kardashians but this girl is gorgeous
She looks like much better version of ali McGraw 😂.
She’s so pretty
IM LITERALLY AUDREY NAMED AFTER AUDREY HEPBURN AND IM A SCORPIO!!!! I'm so delusional but omg, makes me so happy! Khloe, is always my fave but I think Kendall is my number one now. We're so same!!
Kendall,love your honesty @ the first of this video saying you didn’t know what you were doing. You’ve come a long way,you worked for it,wasn’t given to you. Awesome job !
Praying hands….🙏🏾 ?????? 😢
😌🌹
No!
Kendall is as articulate as she is beautiful. It's so nice to see a match of wit, beauty and grace!
She is pretty gorgeous
Kendall is the only sister/daughter out of the main casts, that isn't a mother.
What is the Instrumental music that plays at the end/outro of this vid as the credits play? Anyone know?
What does HAGS mean at the end?
“Beep Beep”
She's so gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous
I like how she wears inspired and modified versions of classic dresses instead of ruining them ,like Kim
I'm glad she shares her beauty and her fantastic  body with us. Gorgeous.
Kendall Jenner is a beautiful girl :)! Very nice presentation. Very real girl.
Kendall.             My.                     Name is.             Kendall Davis.             That.         Is Krazy 😊😊😅😅😮😮🎉🎉😂😂❤❤❤❤
This is kylie G i dont need to yell anyone about irish chris eduard martirosyan and me cause hes mine only.
That 2021 metgala dress is one of the finest looks of Kendall
Nts 6:59
Kendall reminds me Olivia Rodrigo at the same time..
Her red hair and that Met 2021 look were just sensational.  They got a lot of attention which is the purpose of fashion, even that Coachella look, maybe now is not a thing no more but at that time is was ICONIC.

She definitely has the best style in her family . I actually can't believe she's older than Kylie...
😍😘🥰🤩
Your my favorite
Your a very  impressive  woman and  I very mature person. Everything is just chilled. Tired  got some AI.  Quantum  computer software for stock market analyzing.   Got a load starting today.    I saw a bunch of your  shows but truly don't know if you would know it but no worries.
Awee this is my fave video of her now
Definitely missed the shy version the most
Te amo Kendall
Letztens habe ich in meinem Auto gefurzt...
May the lord protect you and your family 😮 it is ye lol
she can't even pronounce versace correctly
I love her
it’s 3am.
She is really pretty and speaks soo well❤
🥰YES

this was coachella 2016, this was the vibe at the time okay you need to understand

😅get sweaty
Amazingly impressionable personality, epressive, open, pleased with life! Such character may be personal life development, may be parents' guidance or both. So bravo to whomever instilled, help bring her to being so pleasent disposition!   Happy family & career young lady. Beutiful inside, outside. Do you sing?
I think Kendall has more her father personality thats why she is a bit different than her sisters
kendall jenner is literally my comfort person
Absolutely; stunning love
❤❤❤❤ beautiful
For me kendall is never a pick me girl. Everyone say she is a pick me but i find her real. Like real whyy i can't explain i just find her real tbh.
She SERVES every look
She seems to be the one who works and hangs with not family members.  Start woman,  she still loves her family but they do not boss her and they dont seem to cut her down.
I love Kendall with all my heart
2022 Dolce & Gabbana dress is beautiful❤❤❤ All the looks are a beauty Kendall😊😊
Kendall Jenner такая красавица
I love her energy and her personality 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

👥
👏
having fun reading the comments🫶🏻
song at 0:02??
Kendal u r best ,u r out standing .I adore u
I know they would never do it but it would be amazing to see both if not just one of the Olsen twins do one of these.
Idk why everyone hates her while she's so well groomed and stunning
Iconic 😍
I love this side of Kendall! she's comfortable and in her element here.
Drop dead plastic and Botox 😂
I just love her personality ❤️
I bet Kendall’s amazing in bed
Red is best, do it! lol
she's so perfect I wanna marry her
Приятно удивлена, читая такие добрые комментарии о ней. Она просто закрытый человек, а люди видят в этом высокомерие. Такое со мной тоже происходит постоянно. Я ее прекрасно понимаю. Просто закрытые люди мало дают информации о своей личности и люди додумывают плохое, потому что недостаток информации - это неизвестное, а люди боятся неизвестности. Отсюда и рождаются глупые и злые слухи. Думаю, она хорошо поработала с психологом, чтобы суметь открыться достаточно чтобы дать людям информацию о себе и оставаться при этом в безопасности. Рада за нее! Я еще учусь этому.
Kendal is so pretty
❤❤❤
She is more mature and well speaking✨✨
Its hard not to like her she seems like a really nice girl who appreciates what she has

I just like the fact that she's so kind to herself.

More like she met vigil thru KANYE, get it correct kenny!
*Is Kendall a fan of Audrey Hepburn???*
😊🙂
🧕
Why everything she says looks stupid and lack notion ?
Why does she says “ hey guys it’s Kendall Jenner “ instead of “ I guys, I’m Kendall jenner”. Looks arrogant the way she says it
כמה ניתוחים כפרה
So vain😂😂😂
You are beautiful. Please don't alter your lips, cheeks, butt, arms, tummy, eyebrows,...please stay natural...you'll be better for it.

Why is she so pretty 😕

I adore her 💗
She's so irresistible 😍

Kendall has such a relaxed posture, mind, voice and style. People can hate on her all they want, i can agree on the fact that she’s cringe at times. But she is the realest out of the family, no matter if you think she’s a mean girl. She’s naturally that way, spoiled introvert somehow.
Would love to see Hailey Bieber do one of these

喜欢她的衣品，非常会穿时装。
Okay the first met gala nose is clearly different…
i love u kennyy u are so beautiful
Bold and beautiful. No wonder she is the highest paid.

Ok now I’m in love
Ha yes the Epsteins of the modeling industry nepotism at its finest
❤
🗯
Dear Kendall, it’s Versace not Versaci.
She doesn’t give supermodel or model face to me. It’s giving more pretty horse girl at high school to me.
Nicee
Such a beautiful woman ❤
we are normal human who are growing up all the while.
Let’s try to guess at what point the “enhancements” started!
Annoying AF!
Maybe practice the humble look

kendall really has grown. she seems more mature and comfortable. she looks beautiful as always (don’t even comment about surgery cause its so irrelevant. she’s still beautiful asf). i love her smile so much. the 2021 met gala look will forever be my #1 favorite look of her
one thing about kendal is she will remind us she’s a tomboy
Photoshoot perfect👍
Records Woardd,. 🥰🤩😊
🥰😍😘😊🙃
I like that she comes off natural and not more than who she thinks she needs to be …. her sister are still learning it seems to not act but just be . The camera catches everything and magnifies it by 1000x
Atte yoiiiooo
she’s gorgeous
0:40 "She *was* so confident when we were younger" :(
Hello and welcome to my health channel 😊
Meu senhor, de todos os trabalhos que ela fez, nenhum ficou bom 🫢 Faltou sal, faltou carisma, faltou carão, faltou talento.
Kendell is such a beauty🥰😘
The News is out, Kendall is just an ugly dude in a dress.
I love how she is so kind to herself. Many people would look at their younger self and go “ew, that’s so embarrassing. I look so ugly and hideous.” But instead she embraces her younger self and looks at her with love and admiration. She’s not a perfect person but i think this is something people should learn.
cool
Kendall linda 💖👏👏👏
Kendall J. breaks down??? The poor little thing...........
Ilove you kendall ❤❤❤
versacii
I wish to meet you! Im your very very 2000x fan im in 🇯🇵 but im Filipina 🇵🇭
2:03 she looks so much like kim in this picture
The cowboy boots , the brown leather jacket and the brown ish hair are just so natural , effortless and amazing! yes to the style
Pass is the passed ... don't look back ... just keep pushing forward .

❤ breakdown! Your fashion sense hasn’t grown since your first debut on the Kardashians. The green coat is genius. It’s different and attention, grabbing and certainly fashionable.❤
🤩i like your look😘
I would love to spend a day with her. she just has this calm, mature and understanding energy and seems like a nice friend to have.
She’s so pretty especially in this interview.
Missing the time of real models... what happened to you vogue, so sad;(
I didn't even recognize her in the blonde wig!
You can tell Kendall has been working on her positive affirmations
Loved Her MetGala outfit 2021
shes such an icon
She is amazing! I love how her speak English 💜💜💜
Naturally beautiful, my favorite picture was with you and  Booker 🌹
I love how she kept saying “my sister Kim,” as if just “Kim” wouldn’t be enough. 😂  I want to know what brand of lashes she’s wearing in this video!! I love how they’re angled slightly out, like on a diagonal. It adds to the cat-eye effect.
Loe u Kendall
She's cute, but that's all, nothing extraordinary, nothing special about her face.  There are mind-blowing girls who don't have a chance of becoming a top model, because they don't have famous family.  It's just my honest opinion, it's not a hate.
You have done such a great job for the whole time
The prettiest of all the girls
classy, classy, but still sophisticated. Outstanding!
My big dream one selfi mam big fan
Hello mam I am big fan mam I form india love you mam
Why did she write ‘H.A.G.S?’
You are the most beautiful in the world.
How much beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
Ver-Sah-Chay
Why did I think she was priyanka chopra for a second 💀😭
Shes talking but she aint saying nothing
shes so incredibly beautiful wth
Real model.
They skipped like 7 years in the beginning
Somebody getting severely pissed at me huh red checker suck yellow and black
Hello Kendall, I haven't seen you for quite a while; I believe I did not recognize you the last time I saw you -I almost feel like I got you back. Be well!
Und ich bin der Wächter vom Paradies 🤗
Mmmhhmm ago 3 months 🙂
what does it mean H.A.G.S?
mature version
she is so beautiful in all the photos..... the orange dress was the best one
I really love her beauty.
5:12 the start of a revolution
She is gorgeous. ❣️
😒😒😒😒
Give me Kendall, I'll be straight as a ruler 🥵😍
I love you$
♡ I LOVE YOU  SWEET  SOUL
Okay, but her orange feathery Met Gala dress was such an iconic moment for her!!!
Like wtf changed in Kendall's face ....her surgery makes her look so pretty 😂😂😂😂😂
Hey kendal you need to go for Austin butler he loves your body type 😉 ❤️
Want to see one with Stella maxwell! 🤗🥰
Wooow ! increíble
I love her ring.
Please tell me what the question H. A. G. S? means. It can't be the obvious google answers bc they're not questions.
Kendall's attributes exceed my needs. She is everything and more than I ever fathomed.
Isn’t one of those red pics actually Bella hadid
nice album album shoe 🔥🤍🥰🌻
https://youtube.com/shorts/mrdJoBvh0uQ?feature=shareAllah
I can’t stop looking at her nose job it’s so conspicuous when she’s smiling !  Nepotism is one thing but the fact that that they’ve gone through plastic surgery even though there are so many beauty models who deserve more appreciation than these rich kids makes me really angry  sorry 😢
In India, Suger Cosmetics
she is such a pick me girl oh my gosh and I don’t know why but I hate her voice and the way she is talking, maybe because I think she is acting fake
Where is the Pepsi commercial outfit
Pick me
We need also kylieee
🌍👤🇸🇦🤍🤍🤍🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟👍👍👍👍💯👉🤍🤍🤍🔺️🔺️🔺️🔺️🔺️
Finally
Kendall you don't need any plastic surgery your born gorgeous a blessing never get that your beautiful as is
I don't think that her style is something that she wears for her job as a model.
Such a lovely young lady,  so well spoken and humble.
So down to earth love her
How interesting…Kanye and Kim have been divorced for not even a full year snd she’s referring to him as “her husband at the time” as if the marriage is a distant memory lol
Why she say “Versaci” haha Gigi’s probably really mad at her
Can you do 16 looks with Hailey Bieber. 🥹. Patiently waiting
What about my version Kendall 😝
I love how she wore a dress made for her instead of wearing the actual dress of Audrey Hepburn.
Can't deny her every single looks were the PERFECT.
Does she have any surgery also? she has a perfect face!
Love you Kendall.  You are so genuine. Let's do lunch!  My treat :)
Oh wow, it's so strange to see her with her own face in the 2007 pic...
Why were they even at the met? Ugh. Less filling and lifting. She really should not be able to buy Vogue to this level
🙏🙏🙏🤓🤓🦋
Kendall, how can you forgive me? I don't understand whether you allow me to watch your channel or not. Dear Kendall, please forgive me.
More kendall and fashion content! Really can see her light up talking about what she’s passionate about
Mera mummy dudh khatam ho gaya h
I wanna go coachella
fav 2022 paris🥺✨♥️🤟🏻
I appreciate how she don't say 'like' a lot
She looks beautiful sort of like a very young Pricilla Presley..
kocham was
I feel like people hate on her too much, I think this is the real her and she's really calm and chill
kim and her husband at the time 🤔 wooow i sthat supposed to be kanye
HAPPY BIRTHDAY KENDELL <33
I love you Kendall Jenner
Love kendall❤️✨🤩
HAPPY birthday kendall
Skidameringkedingkedo😃
she’s too young for this lol you have seasoned artists and models on this channel meanwhile she’s got maybe 5 years of looks
kendall is the prettiest jenner/kardahain . Prove me wrong.
Vogue can we see one of these with Hailey Bieber!? Love this series so much!!
Yeah big and fun..
It probably wolud still be boring.
Where you got bored.
PLEASE DO TAYLOR SWIFT
She's always misunderstood. She's an introvert but not mean.
Britney please..
I loved loved that Givenchy outfit that she wore for the MET Gala amazing.

MAHAL NA MAHAL KITA KENDALL MWUAH MWUAH ACKKKK
I really loved the ginger hair on her
She seems nice but I just find it so hard to like her because the main reason she’s so successful is because of her family / connections and surgery. Can’t deny that she, Hailey and the Hadids had major advantages. Connections are everything and they had them all. Let’s be real a lot of things were just handed to her
Very Beautiful 🙏🏻
The most natural one out of her family 😍
One outfit was missing, vogue India 🇮🇳 where she at
such a shame she wrecked her face😔
She is so beautiful!
PHOBOS
She makes me so interested in modelling even when it’s not my interest, that’s how passionate she is. It’s truly admirable.
Kendall is love
Beautiful 😍
Omg WHERE is the black sequins MET look where it’s just draped over her body, backless, sheer-booty look??? With dark crop-ey shoulder length hair, circa 2017??? Iconic!!!
Thankyou universe
that little boy will be the love of her life!
I seen it in one of my dreams that she will soon have a little boy!
kidall will have a little boy first!
Kendall Jenner will have a little boy soon!
She is so pretty

I love the way she talks❤️ so calm❤️

So fake and boring....
Who is this girl in Paris ? Giselle Bündchen forever!
I saw her once without make-up on.  She looked like the typical high school girl. Just without an education.
How beautiful she is😍
I actually wanna cry. I am so jealous of her life.
St. Joseph terror of demons pray for us...   ...
💗💖🤧
Kendall seems to be very smart and she's matured a lot, it's satisfying to listen to her
This was so graceful and soothing to watch.
love the way she talks to camera  she has gained more confidence compare to last year hope she could stay same status as now (tho I know life always changes)
You are Most pretty and iconic face☺
👍
I want back kendall with red hair too
the most boring person
She's fine, but she comes across as really self-obsessed and conceited. You can tell she lives in her own bubble. Everything she says is so self centred it doesn't rub off in the best way.
she comes across so well in this!
2015 Vogue and 2018 birthday.🤩🤩🤲🏻🤲🏻
I love her accent, also her styles.
I really admire her,she really proud of herself ❤
What lipstick are you wearing?
she messed her face up with filler
Can’t deny the fact that all her Met Gala looks are always iconic and beautiful since her debut at the hall
She looks so pretty 🤩
i love her, she such a beautiful girl, everyone has bad traits so, accept that including me.. that's normal, look at her she's pretty, and looks mature here, i meant it!
Herpes of society.   But the bots seems to feed this as amazing.
Look,
hi kandall I'm your biggest fan there's honestly no one who likes you as much as I do you're a great model and you're just the best if you answer I'd be so happy💕💕
2021 met gala😍😍
Just plain black shirt in a Vogue video is OKAAAAAY thank you Kenny! All the love! ♥️
She looks so so so beautiful in thus interview alone
Kendall is the only one who looks back and doesn't feel embarrassed.. like she genuinely misses and smiles   (Which means shes grown up so much now .. u gotta grow to miss your past)
Perhaps this video is a bit long. I love you but you lost my attention span  & possibly others. maybe break the vid up.?
V
I need one of these with Gigi hadid
Has anyone else noticed that her one front tooth looks kinda dark?
Am I the only one that has noticed that kendall has a deat tooth?
She is the odd one of the Kardashians... And that's why i like her... ❤️
Kendall call me sometime 😉
She's basic...
Your is a rascal.
I' m rufian human... 😋😘😅
Let’s never forget how this horrible family became famous. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uF-7KWuF1Ok
and people say she does not give any credit to kim oh really
Kendall: Kim and her husband at the time... **NERVOUS CHUCKLE**
I wish I was born beautiful like her.
People are gonna lose their homes and she thinks this is gonna help
Definitely the most real of the Kardashian/Jenner's. She's stunning and seem to have great values.
her signature is so neat and pretty
Love her ❤️❤️
What happened her teeth  Alcohol eat teeth hhhh
What is H.A.G.S ? Meaning ?
She’s such a Scorpio 💗
Yet Jaci has to say Kendall copied her red hair like who even is she
Say what you want about this girl she is a beautiful girl and she is about the only one I can stand out of this family🤣 sorry just being honest
She's can cast as alicent in Houes of  Dragon
11:52 ok, I got it, that was in Paris, but Kendall, the question is, who was exactly in Paris???
Nice so family super
She is stunning ❤
The most REAL sister.
I love her western side. She pulls it off so well just like Gigi. An all American girl (:
LO.VE.
She really cool!
10:14 that dress is the best......
She seems so likable in this
she is a model and she didn't know the pronunciation....it's V-E-R-S-A-C-EEE not V-E-R-S-A-C-IIII....it's really annoying for Italian hear it! Even Donatella said that people don't understand how to say and pronounce her brand!!! 🙄
Vanity looser, even your pale pal made you, dork Enjoy what? No story, such a pale pal yourself
"I was using kims makeup and hair people"
You’re stunning but… it’s Versace, not Versaci 😪
ahh it's so eargsm to listen to the way she talks, idk her voice is soothing, calming, and pleasing
She is the cutest. Just love her and how real she is. Confident Kendal is a whole vibe!
I could listen to her voice all day long!
True growth and beauty
Normal people- i  Kar- jenner- aaaaaiiiiiii
Delightful!!❤
L.O.V.E.
Who cares?
What does hags mean?
Kendall's voice is so calm. I could literally spent the whole day listening to her voice
💙💙💙💙💙
What did she write at the end ? :)
Who cares?
Not bringing back the hags 😭
Besides the fact she kept calling MERT ...MATT it was all smooth sailing
Ugh I hate Kendall so much I can't stand her vibe
They should put the pic of her dress during the met gala this year. I really want to know why she decided to go no eyebrows
The only Kardashian/Jenner who doesn't annoy me.
I never knew red carpets and modelling were this complex 😳
Absolutely stunning look
"It's Versace not Versacee" XD
I have never been a fan of any Hollywood actress or a model before but after watching this Kendall Jenner's interview,I became a fan of her...She is so sweet and beautiful and all her looks were fantastic.👌👌👌
She’s really the perfect faced woman for me. Admire her very natural wit.
So pretty and chill 😍😍
She talks like Bella
What’s wrong with her front tooth?
This was such a fun way to watch her style evolution. Love all of her looks!
the problem with this serial is vogue tries TOO hard to advertise their own covers and galas that we really don’t get to see when these women actually dressed theirselves and created their own looks
Kendall is my favorite! I can relate with her the most I have panic attacks like her and i love horses! And shes very minimalistic like me too
L.L.C.
What is H.A.G.S.??
14:18 sus manos son hermosas omg
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
Nepotism.
why did she say "kim and her husband at the time" like he's unknown
I wonder when this was recorded. Its kinda weird she didnt mention that Virgil has passed....
she looks like her mother alot ❤️
❤
Her face almost has that uncanny valley-look
i am not perfect nor am I ever going to be
Give us Candice
waittttyt that’s not bella?? i thought it was bella
She's chill
You're the worm.Are you the one who has ruined the lives of ordinary people since 2007 and then translates into English the stories of working life where ordinary people worked and posts them on U.S. sites? You look like a worm with DiCaprio a year. Needle American celebrities and ordinary Americans who I goofed up my social life of Koreans. Bug the same year. Needle to gloat. and You're spying on ordinary people and celebrities going on, made up women and the same bar. Bug the same year. You'll cry and feel guilty about ruining the social life of the public.
2:25 "my sister Kim and her husband at the time" so Kanye lmao the shade hahaha
Poor horse. Why do they need to use animals to serve a purpose?? Very unethical
Her voice have finally come in.
Kendall has great style see seems like a lovely young woman ❤ And that Givenchy dress just stunning
At leas, be able to pronounce it correctly!!! VersacE not VersacI!!!!
she's sooo pretty
Aw Kenny, I love this review of your looks and the way you delivered it 👍🏼
versaCHI VERSACHIIIII dios mio te dedicas a la moda y no sabes como se pronuncia una de las mas importantes, legendarias. que asco
shes glowing 😍
The red hair really suited her.. also I noticed one of her front teeth is darker at the top, wonder why? Horse riding accident?
Nice
i knew one day she would become super model when she looks so like the lady in Mummy 1
Her walk is still terrible, what is she talking about 😂
LOVE YOUUUU
I love u Kenny! !
One of the of the best thing about dude is that whenever he achieves something, he never gives the credit to himself.He.always respect  us, the audience the most and his team  too. He is always polite in every of his video .We congratulate ourselves for this achivement . More to come and everything  to come. We're always with you ❤
❤
Yeah, sure. Phoney!
so proud of u 🤍
A
How does she remember which happened whennnnn
Omg I love her so much ❤
She looks so much like Khloe here.
I just love these videos. Well done, great outfits.
Iranian Wemon need your help and your voice.
Help people in Iran.
PLEASE DO MONICA BELLUCI
“She was so confident when we were younger” lmao the shade Kendal gave to Kylie
Her front tooth is dead 😢
She’s so pretty.
Why is nobody talking about her writing H.A.G.S. at the end of the book LOL that's so funny
When did she become so well spoken ???
❤️‍🔥
WOW I had never heard her talk so much, super nice.
it's VersacE and BEluchi! study more
her versace met dress and the givenchy audrey hepburn inspired dress are the most beautiful dresses ever omg
Whoever’s reading this, I pray that whatever your going through gets better and whatever your struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine 💖
I just love her she is so pretty
She copy selena gomez:/
I enjoy watching her in her career.
There are millions of them.
Have jour own retards for free.
Fine with me.
Why do feel almost attacked when she speaks? Theres something in the way that she talks that sounds line she wants a reaction
I love kendal jenner so much
I miss her red hair too, the color looks great on her
Just turning 18 and getting asked to walk in a sheer top just sounds off 😭🤣
VOGUE, GIVE US RIHANNA NEXT PLEASE BRO
Beauty fresh☺️
Really great to see a model do so well
Excited!!
She looks so much like her mom
Filled with ego
Her eyes look like Kris nowadays
she looks so different
at least let her get 50 before doing this
What about vs fashion show looks?
Kendall, our fashion icon
what are the vintage cowboy boots they're insane
What does H.A.G.S mean
Gorgeous,   She signed H.A.G.S , ?? What does that stand for
She no different to any of the  other Clan, don’t know how all the people believe such hype.
Literally she is so sweet and kind ! the way she carries herself is amazing
Nice
She said stop so I didn’t waste my time with the video 😂
I l♡ve Kendall^^
Kendall Jenner is a fashion icon and exudes class in anything that she wears. She's down to earth and I have literally watched her grow up  on TV over the years. She's beautiful and captivating.
Whats up? The only she has cirugy.
No entiendo, no tiene nada atractivo, únicamente cirugias y ya.
i love that kendall doesn't demean her younger outfits, even if she wouldn't wear them now.
Love this vlog, you are so inspiring 😍  I also just made a vlog video! 💕
do people get to keep their books of looks?
crazy how much she changed her face over the years
She is the best talker out of her sisters. They all take long pauses, but her pauses are shorter and makes it easier to listen.
Out of all the kids, she looks the most like Kris
“my sister Kim and HER HUSBAND AT THE TIME”😭😭
I adore her but life in looks? She is a baby. lol
A natural beauty
Hi
It hurts my ears hearing VERSACEEEEE no versaci, can´t believe that after being a model for almost a decade and actually having  worn Versace she keeps mispronouncing
The way she gave credits to everyone on her team. ❤
The least worst of the Kardashian brood whores
Why does her whole family look like their face is swollen
Yet none in this coven can keep their men. Devin dumped her but she won't let him go.
Kendall is such a classic beauty 💚

At 8:00 minutes exactly she said tea and they edited it to say taquila 😂
If you stand for humanity be the voice of Iranian people.innocent lives are in danger #mahsa_amini #mahsaamini
Thanks kenny
No 👽👾💀
She is actually the beautiful one of the clan
VERSACH-AYY!! not Versaceee!! 🤣
She looks even more diffident here.. her nose looks redone.
my name is candle
She’s so beautiful and gorgeous ❤
vogue is way too obsessed with the karjenners oof
More Kardashians on Vogue? This is so pathetic at this point. Embarrassing. Anna is so clueless.
I swear she always pulls off the Met Gala looks that crystal one and the orange looks is so iconic
So pretty
It is insane how beautiful she is
She looks so beautiful ❤️
So lovely ❤
Eww
I love how she talks she is very soft polite and eloquently spoken words!
What a narcissist.

She’s my favorite. The realest.
I want to be a model
i love you Kendall ❤
don’t usually watch the kardashians, but she’s lovely
“I’m so sorry for anyone that thought this was real “ Duh bro c’mon...👀
She is soooo pretty and I really like her laugh
she’s so mature and genuinely beautiful. loved this video & all these looks were iconic. her being grateful for her growth and the people who helped along the way is very sweet.
She’s so beautiful, her eyes are stunning 😍
Just realised she looks exactly like young kris jenner 😮
Very gracive
Please do Diana Ross and more iconic artists who styled themselves
The nauseating pump architecturally sneeze because brand kinetically invite onto a woozy pear. well-made, enchanting peak
Vogue.. please get J LO on this show!
i love all ad this outfit so bad omg !!!
♥️♥️♥️♥️
Kendall has ALWAYS been the BEST one of the Kardashian/Jenner monstrosity! She's so down to earth/normal if that word can be used when talking about the Kardashians
12:48 so cute!
❤️❤️❤️
*yawn* next
:My sister Kim and her husband at he time.
She looks so stunning in that off white look
14:46 minute of waste of time
I love vogue,i would love to be in a coverd🥰
I don't know why but i think she's healing herself and seems to be better than the past ❤
The Kardashian’s timing is perfect, dropping this video just in-time to cover up Kim’s scandal
husband at the time… SAY YES NAME
the way she is faking it makes me realize she should be acting better in her kuwtk
who calls themselves a tomboy in 2022 lol
How she managed to grow up to be so humble and gracious is nothing short of a miracle.
She comes across as so down to Earth. Wasn’t expecting that. Not sure what I expected.
I see a lot of Kris in her face
😍💗🥰🖤😎💖✨🦋💅🏻💃📸🖼️💎👜
She’s starting to look more and more like her mom every day. Which makes sense but is still surprising given the plastic surgery
🤗😌
The only one that i admire, follow, and really love to see out of her silly fake family. She's a georgous normal girl in my opinion ♥️
i like hearing her talk :)
She is so toxi.toxic.. don't believe  Google it! So many videos
KENDALL. JENNER. KISS. AMBER. HEARD.
she did not put HAGS😭😭😭
Honestly annoying me how long she’s been in the fashion industry and still can’t pronounce Versace
I am impressed with her speaking style and vocabulary.
I love her hair style, look really comfortable and fit her well
how is it possible to be that pretty????
This is how you can say that people be hating and judging a lot about someone they know nothing about but the things that are only shown on media. People keep on saying that she's ungrateful and such a brat, well for the most part she was a brat back then, but it doesn't mean that she wasn't appreciative of the privileges she had.  This video proves that controversial celebs like Kendall have to carry a lot of emotional and mental burden just because they want to hate on her and she has so little to say or defend herself just because that's how Hollywood is. Girlie really went into a breakdown spiral of anxiety yet people are still ruthlessly bashing her. Everyone acts like they're better than celebs when in fact those haters are just as worse. Atleast she has now improved a lot and acknowledged the fact that she was clueless and knew no better back then.
I mean. The sheer boredom of it all.
So now' you're a celeb too. How boring was that.
Your narrative.
And then they tought you how to walk?
I love how Kylie was talking about her first met and she said Kim and her husband at the time 😂😂😂😂
EmRata's life in looks next!!!
Kendall’s handwriting tho😍
the H.A.G.S really sent me back to middle school in the mid 2000's. love it.
I love watching people that are just plain lucky preach about crap
What does H.A.G.S? mean?
On how liberals / democrats looks & acts like 🤡s...👍🏼
im a tomboy at heart
https://youtu.be/EiegrMn8sI8
I like her the most. I hope she will make an impact in the fashion industry and see more of her creativity.
Love it! ❤️
I really enjoyed watching this video. Kendall has so much class. The interviews I’ve seen always show her family as humble and thoughtful, and very polite. I’m happy for them that they are successful.
She looks so much like younger Khloe in this video
Probably a nice person but god is she boring
I can’t believe they made that feather piece over night 👀
I love Kandall 💘 her personality is so amazing
Idk why but her aura is „mean“ i just can’t get myself to like her. She seems like a mean girl
It’s pronounced Versace, not Versace!
What does h.a.g.s mean?
Is she saying Matt and Marcus
You're so gorgeous 🥰
If there’s one family I’m sick of having shoved down my throat it’s the Kardashians. Can’t you guys just go die somewhere out of  public view?🤣
whatever dresses you have wore you're definitely gorgeous all dresses matched you not just your physical appearance and also your personality.
what does H.A.G.S ? at the end?
my sister’s husband at that time wtf
I want her plastic surgeon
sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet
Wow she is so beautiful 😭😁🥰
Any ideas what HAGS means?
baby face angel body  and pure heart
the onyl kardashion that is beautiful. the rest r mannequins
I absolutely LOVE her! She seems so authentic, chill and has a just ust let life happen vibe. My fav!
Education > Vogue = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYcbY4rZoU4
I still have Kendall's first Vogue cover issue :')
I don't even care what she's talking about I am too busy in admiring her beauty 😭😭❤️❤️
who tf is this thot and what has she done to society thats so amazing?
It's a bit of a joke that she says "my sister Kim" like we don't already know
I don’t know what is it but I love this version of Kendall
I love this version of Kendall, especially how kind she is to herself even when she looks at her “cringey” past looks, she stills speaks so positively of her.  And side note this hair and makeup look looks so good on her!
I love how any challenges anybody threw at her she went along with them with such confidence like the sheer top at 18 and then standing on the horse which is so her like I feel like I really got to understand kendall these past 2 years
Ray j
Loved this! 💕 Having Zendaya do this too would be the best 🤞❤️
"She was so confident when she was younger"  "My sister Kim, and her husband at the time" dang man 😳
"That's a factory option, I kinda came stock with that" wonder who said that
Only you will know what this mean s... 50
I love Kenny she is so kind and sweet and taking care of her fans ❤️ And it's nice how honest she is
I like her after this
Kendal is golden ❤
i love her voice sm my baby
Could listen to her talk all day, she’s so honest & enthusiastic! Please do another one with her 😃
Let it be they all know who's guilty
OMG I know your dad, or mom or however they choose to identify this week 🤣
And she will never be classy like Audrey
Just something to note:  she had the luxury of learning how to model *after* she became a model lol which completely explains the atrocious Kendall walk.  For us every day folk, you’d have to learn the skill first before you pursued a career in a particular field that required said skill 😂🥶
She's so beautiful i love her so much 💜
https://youtube.com/shorts/RBWued-fMDE?feature=share
I wish they showed her 2013 model off duty looks those were my fave. I loved the skinny jeans with leather jacket and t shirt. I don’t see Audrey in her street style looks these days but then again she did say she looks to the early 90’s Kate moss. Maybe for her upscale looks she looks to Audrey but her more everyday looks she goes more 90’s.
Cinematic video on my channel 🔥💯🥵
TRUST, BELIEVE, AND HAVE FAITH IN THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND YOU SHALL BE SAVED 🙌 ALLELUIA 🙌 A-MEN' 🌿
She hasn’t learned anything since her first runway show ✌️
at 02:54 when she says she's wearing mcqueen, I thought she was wearing miu miu resort 2016
I love Kendall ❤️
Her 2021 met gala dress made my jaw drop- totally iconic!
She doesnt know whats in there? Literally every move of KarJenners is scripted af.
Now I know why Rihanna is insecure about her... Kendall is a NATURAL BEAUTY!
OMG. Kendall is the older. I can't believe it.🤔🤔
♥️
Facts 🔥🔥🔥 https://youtu.be/klUmsRNR42k
Muito linda
my baby!! 🥺
I LOVE HER
This is one of my favorite Kendall interviews! She seems so inspired and speaks with passion when discussing fashion.
You are the girl who make me always stunning when looking in your eyes <3 very gorgeous
“i’m a tomboy hard” 😝🤭🤪
Very beautiful 🎉❤
Kendall 😍
Is she calling Mert of Mert and Marcus , Matt??? 🥴
If you see this, I BEG YOU to look up for #MahsaAmini on any social media
Почему вы нас уничтожаете?
❤❤❤❤
It’s versache not versachi
No look beats that Pepsi commercial outfit. Iconic.
❤❤❤
Love u
She's cool, except for the fact that she shades n hates Selena after dating her bf that time. Kendall act like Selena did something to her!
She's so nice and positive :)
Kendall do you want us to have a great summer????
Can we talk about how her signature writing is so pretty?
11:53 i could tell awwwwww
why did she write h.a.g.s? at the end?
we did talk u into ocd cause looks like u aint need it :D pff
She manages to be so boring, after working and being immersed in such a colorful world
يا ربي تجنن كندال😢😢🫶🏻
The most insightful Jenner.
There are more important things, DONATE, they are a lot of people that need help.
What i looved most was Kendall being assertive  and  vulnerable  sharing her experiences! Kendell normality keeping her cards close to chest... Giving. a glimpse to the  ever  private Kenny!!!
IDK. But everytime i see kendall she gives off a regina george vibes
Love Kendall, but Monica in that dress literally ate her
Kendall's 2021 Givenchy met Gala look was the best one out of her all met Gala looks
shes glowing omg 😍 absolutely stunning!!
Super awesome
I think that her pronunciation is so clear. I’m not that good at English though I can almost understand what she says. I love the way she says:)
She looks gorgeous in that outfit she wore at Kourtney's wedding !
@technical block
Her yellow thooth😄
Ia her front teeth dead?
the mexicans believe that they can murder babies and call it self defense, their belief is that the baby will be trained to goto war against the mexican race some time in his or her life, so murdering them is self defence to a mexican
‘2020 halloween was this one. I don’t know exactly what year this was’
Love you Kenny
Cucumber
I believe kylie is entering the comment and will try hard and learning with the comment to win just to be better than kendall 😂😂😂
Most people are trying so hard to hate on kendall.omg go away Coreyys just once leave people who truly loves Kendall for who she was to breath and appreciate this beautiful women!!
*#10 on trending. That’s my girl.*
Kendall’s 2021 met gala’s look is such a masterpiece. The dress, the look, the confidence everything!🔥💅💞
I love the whole kar/jen fam but Kenny is by far my fav sister, she is relatable, kind, caring, loving and the best down to earth sister....
I need this but DUA LIPA ❤
Kenni 🦂🦂🦂
Y'all she's a tomboy at heart hsjsjsjsjsjsjisisjs
Time flies
What does H.A.G.S? Mean?
https://youtu.be/eUVKUHNY5Mg
She's beautiful
haiiii ❤️
She is just drop-dead gorgeous. 👀✨
Just love the way she talks about herself. 👀✨
Try getting someone new like JENNIE KIM @vogue
Love you Vouge
https://youtu.be/5wbKsfIOylw🏆
naomi could never
Whyyyy? Why in the world she looks like Indian? Like a gorgeous one? When i was younger i used to think maybe shesfrom bollywood or maybe a sister of dipika padukone
she looks so much like her parents right? upclose it even more clear kris n Bruce (Caitlyn)
Get Rihanna please 😩😩😩😩❤️
gorgeous
PLEAAASEEE DO ZENDAYA IM BEGGGGGGING!!!
2014 Met Gala she does look like a baby! Also, that photo convinces me she’s had a nose job, no big deal but it’s obvious if you look at that pic and now. Always a beauty though.
Can we do kylie
How many thought namaste pose was to capture attention of Indian audience🤔🤔🤔
But she still says she didn’t get  successful cause of her family
Remember the 2016 Kenny vibe?? LA clubs, CaKe era, random Dubsmash, Fashion weeks, rap music, random, playful … I miss that 🥺
literally no bad outfit. period kendall.
💕💕💕
I love Kendall soooooooo much I just feel like I can relate to her a lot than any others in her family
She is looking gorgeous in allll the pics ✨😭💘🫂🧚🏻
I love her sm
glad she came out of her pickmeisha phase. She's so classy and polished now
no one can top the 2019 orange outfit 😍😍😍
What happened to her tooth?
i just love her, she give some good nice vibes keep going kendall
I actually really like her
You won't get a pie crust of yours that easily older to vivid vogue attires attitude, still looks adorable
lmao remember the girl who said she dyed her hair red to copy her but after all it was prada that made her go red head
She keeps raving about Givenchy and has worked with them so many time BUT(!) she can’t pronounce the name correctly! 😃
I Love Kendall and her attitude 💖 can’t wait to see her getting married and having children one day!  She has great potential her time will come💞
I don’t feel like featuring so many runway looks works for this video at all. This is meant to be about HER looks, not the ones she didn’t put together or chose for a show…. Bit pointless recapping her runway looks
her bangs match her so well
she looks pretty in 144p also 😍
Can you guys please do Kylie Jenner next! 😢❤🫶🏼
I love her sm
She is the best of Jenner and Kardashian’s
What does H.A.G.S  mean? 🤔
I love Kendall so much.😞
💜
She and her mum look like they could be twin sisters.
We Need Rihanna
I love how happy she is here!!!
She totally looks amazing. Her confidence is just there there. I think i still have the 2016 US Vogue September Issue. I felt that its really a big thing for her so I went out and bought one
her voice is calming fr
Love that Portofino look
Oh God she's perfect
Kylie would be as pretty as her if she didn’t botch her face
Kendall definitely always Slay in every looks!
Her voice can cure my insomnia .
I feel like she is the most natural and realistic among all her sisters.Just like her sisters  ,she also   done procedures,but still she is so natural and looks gorgeous in every outfit.She is so calm and i love her aura♥️
I think she is absolutely  stunning,
She looks great in everything she wears
It is rare to find celebs, influencers, millionaire's, billionaires, without any plastic surgery in this era... And I should say Kendal looks more natural and less plastic compared to those millions of plastic addicted overdone people all over the world
Kendall♥️♥️♥️
She’s so professional 🥰
life in looks..? shes not even 30 😭
So calm 😌
plastic scarecrow
The celebrity worship on this channel is honestly disturbing.
Where’s the one with the Pepsi
Can we talk about how pretty she is, probably the prettiest Kardashian!
She’s my fave kardashian/Jenner
Cutest
her and that tom boy narrative 💀💀😭
Wow... I didn't even skip a second of this video
Whatever, didn't take her long to turn me into her fan
Kendall: 2020 Halloween was this one Kendall: I don’t know exactly what year this was
F**K this narcissist family of water wasters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Iranians are fighting for their freedom and the government is trying to shut us up!!! Please be our voice #helpiran #mahsaamini

You are to me the pretiest of the kardashians and a great model.

I love youuuu❤
hello to those who read this, I take 1 minute of your time to tell you that Jesus loves you with all his heart and that he calls you to follow him, because he loves you so intensely that he is put on the cross to wash away your sins because he loves you more than anyone in this world and Jesus Christ has a plan for you and know that he is coming soon and this world of depravity is over the point of disappearing 😬

03:00 that's not her at all 😂
She's so beautiful
When can I watch the kardashians season 2 on Disney plus it is still not available on Disney plus in india please help
Jale got me enbrujado to y'all
She is way too young for one of these episodes.  Nothing against her, but these are for people who've been around for decades.
She seems so bright and happy in this video! More self-assured, humble and comfortable. I think a lot of people misjudge her. She seems like she's actually more naturally shy and what people in the past have perceived as her being "cold" or "rude" is more just insecurity and awkwardness. It's good to see how she's grown to be more comfortable in her own skin
GO BACK TO REDDD
Hi
She is well spoken and mature
Red hair is wonderful and it is hard to maintain, but it’s sooooo beautiful on you.
BOOOOORING LOOKS, BORING PERSON, NEXT! 🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
I love her so much
Wow it's Kendall.
Kyle and Kendall is such a goal as a sister
Why do people hate her so much?! She seems like such a nice person to be around )
Saludos desde Guatemala🙏🏼
What does her message stand for? H.a.g.s ?
SALUTE LIL SIS
LIL SIS SO COOL WHATS THE DEAL WITH THE URBAN SCHOOLS YALL TRULY DO iNspire QUEENS

Nepotism baby
kendall is stunning
she looks very HEALTHY and RADIANT, prolly her era ❤
She is so gorgeous!
She is amazing
she got swag fr
I can definitely see how humble mature and comfortable Kendall has grown into. This is the first interview I feel I saw her personality really come out.
not her calling Anna Wintour a hag 😩💀
Her older pre-polished face reminds me of Victoria Beckham's younger face... the nose, lips etc
❤️
Its really nice to see more of her personality. She is so chill and cool
Wowwww.. Beautiful ❤️
True beauty😍
Ugh she’s so pretty 🧡🧡
The "cherry-pick" gal looking at her cherry-picked gigs looks.
you are the best to me 😍
What happened to her tooth?
okei someone see the one teeth in her mouth is weird just  i am saying this is  normal? that distracted me a bit jejejeje
Please use these hashtags to support Iranian freedom fighters , #mahsaamini,  #mahsa_amini,  #iran_protests,
she’s so stunning wow
she needs to bring back her red hair i love it so much
I laugh when people say she's the most natural. She's had a nose job, lips and something done to her eyebrows/ eye area.
LOVE HER PERSONALITY
"Matt & Marcus"
every pretty girl does not make a good model and it's okay to say it! lmfao

My only one crush Zayn Malik..
My only one crush Zayn Malik
red hair kendall is the best ever i swear 😂
Worthless family.
i cant believe they forgot to show her the last met outfit, the one where she had bleached eyebrows!?!
Love, Kendall the Model ❣️
i really loveeeeeeeeeee kendall jenner so muchhhhhhhhhhhh thanks vogue
i love the h.a.g.s. at the end 😂😂
She has really grown so much. We love you Kenny, you are such an inspiration.
This did not need to be this long.
Her face looks different. Has she went through some plastic surgery or something?
O my god she looks so young, a way younger than kylie… can’t believe she’s older than kylie
She is one beautiful girl in the world ❤
The Monica's beluchi outfit was cool I love matching pieces
She sounds very scripted
her chopard party 2018 green see through outfit was so iconic, she should have reviewed that
she should have reviewed some of her see through outfits where she freed the nipple
Every look beautiful
I've never known of more vapid, useless people being more famous than this family.
She says versac-ē 😮
She’s gorgeous, the only one with a good fashion sense in the family
without salt...lackluster😒
should have reviewed her chopard party 2018 see through dress
better than working ...
She is super sweet and very like-able.
I truly like the 2016 Coachella era it was so naive and indie, she literally invented the hippie hipster girl tumblr outfit
What does H.A.G.S. mean? When she signs her name.
Kendall, want to put some chocolate syrup and orange bitters in a tequila shot, it's like bon bon candy

HAGS??
“I didn’t know what I was doing” yet still walked in a high fashion show. Now matter how hard she tries the nepotism never stops showing
The way she said husband at the time
God bless!! 🙏🏼🤍
her walk sucks, but doesn't mean she is not beautiful. She had some of the most stunning photo out there. Just saying.
Her red hair error looks so good !!
Now she has a boob job, a nose job and face fillers. She definitely doesn’t look the same as she used to
I love Kendall
Shes so cute. I love who she is becoming as a woman. So mature
Her two front tooth are of a different shade.
Kendall Jenner,,,,, what can I say..... I find you to be a very beautiful model who always brings a smile to everyone. 🌸✌️🌸🤗
"Life in Looks" ...  seriously? What is she, 20 or something? More marketing for these people, like they need it. How about a grown woman who's actually lived long to enough to have a life. Good grief.
Her cheeks look different.
OMG SANA SAW KENDALL AT THE PRADA SHOW???
Can we all agree her hair is drop dead gorgeous in this😍
She's a tomboy guys
Omg! Sooo like an everyday person 🤑
Her and her family ruined American beauty standards and women in general
How is everyone literally circle jerking this nepotism baby who serves cold bland mashed potato looks 😂
Kendall sei bellissima 😘😍
Boring
“Her husband at the time” 😭💀 he who must not be named 😂
Hi Kendall  🥰👩🌏
i have been waiting for thissss
her met galas will always be the best
She’s so boring and basic looking, only reason why she’s a model is because of her parents wealth
Please have Emma Chamberlain next! Love Kendall Too
I am wealthier than this Bi*@# . You are all  Beneath me
What does H.A.G.S? mean?
I just love her vibe, she's so sweet and chill ❤️‍🩹
So, April 2016 cover on Vogue was Rihanna.
How lovely!🤙🏝❤️
Finally!!!
Super pretty!!!
The fact they dint include her vanity fair dress and her golden dress is depressing
Kendal jenner is so attractive and beautiful i can't resist my eye on this video my fav model 😍😍
Another useless celebrity
she’s well-spoken. i’m impressed!
I really love Kendall Jenner personality. She is awesome.
She looks stunning and I love how calm and good vibes she is, gorgeous looks
I think she's pregnant
Idk how she became a top supermodel....ehh...
I wonder what goes on in the Met Gala bathroom
Aweeee, sweet Kenniii🤍🤍🤍so cute, so sweet, so gorgeous, I LOVED the red hair. The Evil step sisters look was a fave, but the cheval was bold to the max😍😍😍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍😘😘😘
I know it’s confirmed they are over but it’s still crazy to hear her refer to Kanye as “her husband at the time”
My god. Love her so much 🥺
Is it such a crime to praise her that a lot of people would react negatively if you just comment praising her?
She really is soo kind and looks amazing and she is so different  to her sisters she didn't do so much plastic surgery and whatever others do she is humble and naturally cute
@vogue Iris Apfel? Michelle Obama? We need more inclusivity in your coverage.  @ vogue is not only instagram and reality stars,. Fashion is for everyone, dahling.
Omg! KENDALL YOU’re STUNNER ❤️‍🔥
more videos with kendall plisss
i love kendall sm
can kendall stop with the tomboy stereotype
I just love her!🫶🏽
was waiting for a pepsi commercial fit
I love how she did HAGS 😂🥺❤️✌️
“OMG I CANT BELIEVE THAT…”   No. Just no.
LOVE.
Nothing to see here.. bye
You guys. She never does stuff like this. She said “that WAS my life in looks” !!!! They’re sacrificing her to get to the ultimate level!! Omg 😳 😱
Why the lipstick beyond her actual lips?
can she stop saying she's a tomboy lmao
🙌
My beautiful queen
She is so graceful here. The best interview of hers ❤
Over exposure.
I don’t know much about her, but she comes across quite likeable here, no?
Kim needs to take notes. Copy the dress but don't wear the real one.
Hello guys some of u may not like her! But to me Kendall is a beautiful angel!
her signing H.A.G.S I'm dead
SHES gorgeous oh my
Her teeth???
we stan kendall
Shes defiantly a cool girl
I love,love,love this vogue video of kendall Jenner,and I love her💗❤❤💗💗!! She's so beautiful and sweet
Not a "fan" of her's but I do really like the way she carried herself throughout the interview and how "normally" she spoke..sounded like just one of the girls.
ehh not a fan of this fur hag
YESSSS Finally! My favorite girlie, we need more kendall besties!
Hate her. Don't even know why I'm here
I love how some people just claim to love or like a person or change their view regarding an individual by just watching a 15 min video 😂 If this is the case ,I bet a 15 minutes video of Ted Bundy by vogue can also make few people go soft on him haha 😂
Black features are always the best! Aren’t they? High cheek, pouty lips, small waistline etc…😉
13:02 the way the subtites misspelled monica bellucci.....
LIFE..!!??!🤭😒 she is sooooo young, and there are alot more stories, versions and years left.  She is so ENTITLED  and l truly believe their entire stupid, stinking  and ignorant selfish dumb a family know NOTHING  of the existing calamities, traumas, and severe poverty in our world now.  What this world needs NOW is peace and love.  AND NOT THE KIND THAT SHE SPEAKS TO..... AS... OH, I LOVE LOVE MY CLOTHES AND THIS ALL l am loving.  FKing stupid dumb a beotching family.  Get an education first, then we'll talk. 🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩💩👿👿👿
'love you Kenny 🔥😘
I wish I could wear a saks potts jacket on a chill day 💀
🥰
00:20 she was almost 13
I love how she just has a discolored yellow tooth, makes her more real.
Kendall Nicole Jenner we love you girl, you are my personal favorite model of all time ♥️♥️♥️♥️
Guyssss….. whoever has been picking the looks….. please have a word with them, bc this is not it!   Same with Alexa and Kate’s they had such iconic looks and none of them made the book!
I honestly think she has a great walk but ppl just say she doesn’t bc they don’t like her.
Love this, Kendal is so lovely ❤️
Gorgeous!!!
god i can't believe she's a jenner/kardashian. she's just so normal, so down to earth and genuine. no plastic, just chill vibes and having a good time
I love her
90s girls were a mix of a lot of centuries and not simple
Is there a face filter or something she looks different
She is just so freaking beautiful. I do not care what anyone says!
Great moment, so natural
#mahsa amini
This was the first interview of hers where I feel like you can really see her personality shine through and you can tell she has grown in this chill and mature version of herself🥰 go kenny!
Not her husband at the time 😂😂😂
We know why here Kenis. But i like the 0:41 style.    Look our Kenisdols comments.
Love you Kendall so much
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THEY LEFT OUT 2017 MET GALA LOOK. THAT WAS THE BEST FOR ME
Rest in Piece Virgil.
Kendall put a paper bag on and look phenomenal let’s be honest.
“H.A.G.S ?” AHAHAHAHAHAH
She is very beautifull, she was beautifull even before her plastic surgeries.
I need Zendaya, Ariana Grande, Beyonce, and Rihanna on this series
oh.... shes actually kinda smart and normal.
She is my only girl crush after Aishwarya Rai. I have adored kendall's beauty for years now... ❤ Rare genes.
i love you
bagpipes Ann Winters
Really nice take. She seems content and  relaxed - almost like puberty retreated as well.
She is absolutely gorgeous!!!
Love kendall!!
no one: Kendall: I'm a tomboy
This girl is just amazingly beautiful in such a simplistic way. Anybody know what I’m talking about?
Pick me girl at her best
I love her!!! I never new that she never worked for Prada before until 2022 😳
ooh we’re here early
Overrated .
One of the prettiest *Scorpios* ☆
Not a big fan of her fam but Kendall is the best ! So beautiful & natural girl ! Such an amazing career! ❤
Kendall will always be my favorite Kardashian
She’s so wack lol
People always thinking she got her whole face done, even if she did, half of it is just make up - over-lined lips, nose contour, false lashes, etc.😂
She is such a ray of sunshine ☀️
please get taylor swift to do this or a beauty secrets video !!
She is so beautiful, gorgeous and genuine
THE VIDÉO✨
Stunning
Red hair does look good on her... Ya totally hard to Maintain though
Ok what does H.A.G.S. mean? ❤
wonder how she feels looking at her old face
Selena Gomez did " life in looks " better than anyone .
Great video.😄
Wait so celebrities lay down on the way to these shows? Why is that such a funny thought to me
Her husband at the time 😂👀
I love how she gives praise to all of her glam teams, that shows humility and grace. Definitely the most real of the Kardashian/Jenner's. She's stunning and seem to have great values.
she looks really healthy and beautiful here
i NEED ariana to do this
I so much prefer when they interview seasoned actresses and models that have many iconic looks over the years.
Love Kenny❤
We miss your red hair too 😭💞
#mahsaamini
😊😊😊🥰
Beauty overload. She isEnchanting. Lovely girl .!!!
CUTIESE
Why does she sound like Dakota Johnson? Or is she mimicking her?
Queen Kenny❤️👑🥰
I just love her personality...she so gorgeous
Why are the long shots of this video so blurry?
The way she said "My sister Kim" as if she were talking to regular people who don't really know about her life
She said “VERSACI”😭😭😭
Seeing her watching her as a little girl is so cute, we love the grown up Kendall 💞
❤❤❤
Glad she got rid of the red hair, she’s soo pretty!! 😍😍
You can tell she goes to therapy and has worked her self-love
What is h a g s ?
I love that her met outfits were inspired by Audrey. . That’s what her sister should of done… been inspired by marilyn, not actually wear her dress
Yup, the cult of Hollywood!!!! Inverted Kardashian/ Jenner
Brooo shee is beautiful 😅😩😩😩
H.A.G.S. really unlocked a memory haha
Her plastic surgeons did an amazing job. She and Kylie had the most radical transformations of all the sisters.
She has had another nose job. Sad.
She has not her nose
shes gorgeous
What's wrong with her Middle tooth
Omg she's so boren. Hope she stops being a pick me girl one day
she’s so well-spoken ☺️ such a pleasure to listen to her
Awesome lady!
In 2016 Vogue America April cover was Rihanna .. We can see why they pushed her to september
Her 2021 Met Gala Look is the prettiest thing ive ever seen in my life.
😍😍😍
Just wondering how she gets rid of acne.Her skin is flawless
H.A.G.S.? What does this mean?
Harry styles next pls
Wow, her final message was just so facts and iconic. I wasn’t expecting it but she really made a point
Love▪︎You▪︎Too▪︎Kendall❤
I find it hard to take her seriously, or any person who is relying on family to get connected in a field. There’s a lot of women who didn’t have the same family background or controversy and they are just as beautiful if not more interesting than her.
at least PICK ONE Kendall !!
2:25 “Kim and … her husband at the time” 👀

Has Kendall put on weight or has she had cheek fillers? I like her new look!
Orange Met Gala “Chef’s Kiss” but I love the Audrey inspired gown too!!
Even with all your beauty, you seem to be a very sweet and down to earth girl, intelligent too!
Beautiful girl
Diva 👑🫶🏼
She has the best style out of all of her sisters.
Kylie was so confident when we where younger . Key word was lmfaoo😂
https://youtube.com/shorts/Wr3DnvuU_mo?feature=share
I love how calm she was
I love that they  straight skipping to 2014 just to hide her plastic surgery. Her thin lips and eyebrows that was not tight and pushy like this. I mean she is droppdead gorgeous but she can also embrace that era
aaawn, i adore her mood and sense of normal person :) lovely to hear hers stories.  just an observation: did she hurt her front tooth lately? cuz is a bit darker, right?
Kardashians are the reason I don't buy Vogue anymore 👎
Loveeee
lmao at "her husband at the time"
I love kendall´s style 💓
I think kendall even in her sleep keeps reminding herself that she is a tomboy...
Slayyy gurl slayy  Ur not someone I look up to but I looked so pretty 🤩
Wish they had included her Victoria secret and Cannes red carpet looks.
Monica Belucci was so hot! 😍 Kylie is a cut girl but not a woman...
what lipstick is she wearing
what is she wearing on her lips
didnt know what you were doing but yet you landed a mj runway, ah the privilege to go along with very bsaic style ❤️
Her makeup looks so good here. I wish her makeup artist would do a tutorial. She completely transforms her face!
i love her eyes so much idk like when she talks they just sparkle. it's such a charming feature =
Her money definitely enhanced her beauty and she's a healthy skinny which is good. She seems sweet and I like how she talks more about mental health. She should go back to the red hair it was hawt
She’s beautiful
I love you too 😘
literally BARF
SHE IS SO GORGEOUS
wtf happened to her front teeth
My sweet most beautiful Kendall 💖
Kendall’s most recent MET looks really have been phenomenal
Rob was depressed partly bc he doesn’t feel as supported as the other Kardashian sisters because he was a guy, and Kris didn’t know about opportunities in men’s businesses as much as women’s. They did a whole episode on this where they all went to therapy together. Now Kris is doing her best to give Rob something to do and keep him busy. Don’t blame Kris! She just does what she knows she does best, cause clearly it helped the other 5 girls!!
get kylie on here ASAP!
I think its kind of weird how she says "I USED kim's hair and makeup people" instead of "i worked with kim's makeup artist and hairstylist" or smth like that
the improvement in her walk and the evolution in her fashion style is amazing. can’t wait to see what she does in the future. the way she credits every designer and everything, she seems like such a sweet person-don’t understand why some people can dislike her.
I love the way she talks about herself. She is really proud of herself.
Still didn’t deserve to win the ‘Style icon of the decade award’ 😂
kendall ur so beautiful
Kendall is very naturally beautiful, always has been. I’m happy she doesn’t do all the crazy stuff to her body to make herself look thick or whatever.
She definitely served some looks
How cuteeeee ❤
Pls do one with Taylor Swift 😍😍😍😍😍
What did she write at the end
That beautiful in 11:36 is unlike any other
7:12 Kendall looks like Kourtney
تجنن اموت فيها 🤍😘
we love u kenny 🤍
“ Kim’s husband at the time”
she’s so beautiful?? 😩
Kendall is my favorite.  She's so real.
She seems so happy when she talks about her sister! I wish I had a very close relationship with my family members like that
The sweatiest , mature and ever evolving Kendall J, whats not to love?
Vogue we need christina aguilera
Kendall is truly stunning, and, certainly one of the most beautiful of the Kardashian women.  She remains grateful, grounded & humble ... just love her ⭐ !
More natural and beautiful than your little sister
She definitely has the best style in her family 😍
Kendall you are gorgeous in jeans in gowns in everything ❤
Who else loves her Met Gala 2021 look so much as I do? 🤩❤️
Wow I just can’t- she’s just so gorgeous and chill and so strong. She’s just amazing and I love her. A beautiful woman! <3
✨🙌🏻💝Kendall
*Monica Bellucci 13:03 (caption)
The only "Kardashian" i will always have a crush on. Simply breathtaking. The others sound so annoying with their stupid voices and are always weird to look at when they talk because they have no facial expressions because of their Botox and surgeries. Like Kyles lips completely still as well as her cheeks. Kim's forehead got no movement. Like look up an interview and watch them talk i kid you not.
Wow she’s breaking down her entire career in 14 minutes. BYE!!! 🙄
So what year did she get her nose job, did she get a brow lift too?
waaaaa a beauty
❤
Why is it so hard to listen to her talk?
Why
Awesome ❤️ 🥰
She is gorgeous
I LOVE KENDALL
Kendall is 26...unbelievable
Givenchy & Off white looks are best
i don't think her coachella look was that bad. the only thing i would've changed were her shoes.
I love her sm shes so pretty <33
Her 2014 Met gala look looks like a prome stlye.
how she is so pretty woow
She looks a lot like cloe
What is HAGS she wrote in the end means ?
doesn't she looking little bit different chubby cheeks maybe i m wrong
💗
I'm a fan of Kendall Jenner. My favorite part of her body is her height.
Live you Kendall, so prettyyyy
I like these videos when it’s about someone further in their career. I don’t need to see the last 8 years of Kendall
my sister looks like her
Kenny is so hot
I just love her unreasonably
She is lovely... I love her so much
Nepotism baby with a huge bitchy side trying to act Nice 😂
I love her red hair.
When has she served an “iconic” look?
KENDALLLL It’s Versac -ehh not versa -chyy 😭
Ni talento tiene
I love her😍
One of the best video of this channel
I'm honestly amazed how she has such a "normal" voice compared to other Kardashians/Jenners
So good!!!! Not trying too hard! And not selling stories to make it more interesting!
Ok guys you can say anything about her but dude her eyes..they are dazzling 😵
bye her style is so good, the last two outfits i'd wear everyday
Can’t wait to see Zendaya in one of these next
I am always amazed by her beauty whenever i look at her.. she's just so beautiful
she has great style
I love her 😍
holy smokes her signature is the most beautiful, elegant signature i have ever seen
She had the best subtle surgery. Nose and lips
I wanna see Gigi hadid's and Kylie Jenner version❤️
Wow! So intellectually stimulating! 🤦🏻‍♀️🤡
She looks so much like Kris here, it's something about her cheeks.
we want with kylie!
shes so sweet, well spoken and mature!
Best wishes always
No one can deny…that her orange Versace met gala dress is the BESTTTT she’s ever looked. Can’t be topped
Am I the only one who didn’t see Kendall with red hair?
love her for so many reasons <3
every celeb here:I'm really nervous idk what's in here,, proceeds to tell the exact date of the outfit the very second they lay their eyes on it
what does HAGS (the letters she wrote at the end on the paper) stand for?
Jako si lepa djevojka pozdrav iz Srbije
She did so much being so young
Does she have some cavity in her front teeth?
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
She's a younger version of Kourtney and a little Khloe!! But definitely Kourtney Kardashian barker ALL day
positive energy, she’s embracing her growth :)
Thank god they didn’t show her walking. Gorgeous tho
She actually looks like her mother
omg i love her so much she is so beautiful and kind 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
16 shades of kendall
She seems genuinely such a sweet girl 👑✨
Ken DULL 😑
WHEN SHE SAID EXPERIENCES 💀💀
We need Britney..
She is so grounded and beautiful inside and out, and by far the best Kardashian
Okokok she has style, but I wanna see her on a cooking show so bad 😭
She is ABSOLUTELY stunning- however she lost me at D&G 🤮 #dobetter
She giving cool aunt vibes 👑
emma chamberlain needs to do this vogue!!!!
Miss Ma’am is gorgeous 👏🏽
IM NEVER THIS EARLY
Her best look was when Kylie took the brown dress 💀
I'm here just to comment on those GUYS other than those who actually are related to the particular industry WHY are you guys so obsessed with MODELS that much, look what have your obsession done with many females model so much that they are undergoing to some extreme level of plastic surgery to remain relevant then same guys complain about plastic surgery in your surroundings as well.. 🤔
I've been waiting for this. Thanks Vogue, love Kendall.
This video is Great
7:56 She looks so beautiful and happy ♡
I could hear Gigi's voice: It's VERSACE not Versache 😭
"H.A.G.S." What is it mean ?
i love that kendall doesn't demean her younger outfits, even if she wouldn't wear them now.
love you queen
She is so beautiful, I don’t know why her first met is motivating me to go to my farewell even though I wasn’t going because I have no friends there
She is such a beauty
she’s literally found the right moodboard!
Love Kendall so much
She’s the normal out of all of them
Whoa the cucumber girl
i've honestly been WAITING for this one....
Some celeberties.don't.look like fashionable only the imitating 😒🤔
Booooo she sucks! 🍅
These females will always be in a shadow of famous women they try to copy,wear their style, wear their original clothes. They are given all the privileges with such an ease. Just cause they do a dumb show? The most narcissistic people ever
Kendall's 2021 Met Gala look was just chefs kiss <3
She’s literally her moms face on her dads body

What does H.A.G.S mean?
Gorgeous girl. It’s been amazing to watch her evolve since she was a little girl on the show ❤
this was very unexpectedly wholesome
enough with themmmmmmmmm
My favorite model in the world
Did anyone  else see  her yellow front tooth 🤔? Or I'm hallucinating
she's so beautiful
God her face has changed so much.
She is so pretty
She is so pretty, the prettiest of the klan :)
ILove her ♡
Kendall❤️
Good morning America
Thank you vogue 💕💕💕 I love Kendall Jenner

Put real models with class please ;)
Tão jovem ja está chea de botox ,  exagerou  demais ...

Kendall is so beautiful that I don’t know what to freaking do with myself
Kendall so beautiful
LOVE YOU KENDALL 💗
Finally !! I've been waiting for this one FOREVER !!😍😍😍
Always the Kardashian sisters
Please do Bella Hadid
Kendall has one of the best body types love that for her :')
Kendall is a very beautiful girl.
❤️❤️ Kendall
There she is again, the queen of cucumbers
Here after 47 mins💕
I never realised how similar she looks to Kris, I mean yeah she is her daughter but I can really see the striking resemblance for the first time
Why does she keep saying Matt and Marcus?  Isnt it Meet and Marcus?!
♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️
im so happy she got her lip fillers dissolved
First time I love him when she gets cover for his VOGUE cover..
Her signature 🤍
Please I’m waiting for Diane Keaton!!!
Vogue pls do a video of zendaya !!!!
ahhh she is so sweet I love her
The most recent Met Gala really wasn’t an Audrey Hepburn tribute. Hepburn would never have worn a see-thru dress with a thong underneath or the super short after party dress 🙄 Also, for all of the Givenchy mentions, it’s pretty cringe that she mispronounces the name every single time 😬😖
she is definitely the most beautiful product of Kris Jenner
“kim and her husband at the time” 🤣🤣
I'm not her fan or anything but can't deny that she's drop-dead-gorgeous. Girl looks good in every angle.
I have to correct Kendall Jenner, at 2:56 she says she’s wearing McQueen but she actually wearing Prada Resort 😅
shes so pretty! Can’t you guys agree?
“It takes a great deal of courage to stand up to your enemies, but even more to stand up to your friends.” – J. K. Rowling

Idk why people hate Kendall ? Is there any reason?
She’s so irritating
Theee “pick me girl”
kendall 2022
11:54 is 100% giving STRONG 90's Cindy Crawford vibes
I like how she gives credit to every disigner, makeup artist, brand, friends or family member who contributed to her beautiful fashion sense
She's more natural than other Kardashians
We want Rihanna and Beyonce
Interesting. Down to earth
I love her so much!!🥹🥹❤️❤️
Monica Bellucci*
even though she's got plastic surgery she looks the most natural compared to her sisters
we NEED an ariana edition
She's in her most pretty and iconic phase

Let’s be honest we’ve all been waiting for this
M.U.
She's just naturally STUNNING
Who cares

I actually can't believe she's older than Kylie..
O privilégio 🤢
Slayyy girl
Kendall is a quenn 👑👑
She's got a point, she's a legend and she IS the moment.....now come on y'all
Is the best
Judge me if you want but I freaking LOVEEEE her.
People say that glad she didn't ruin her body like her sisters but don't u realise she's a model and in modelling they need to maintain their body figure!!🤷🏽‍♀️ Otherwise she must be also in their body type by surgeries by now
i'm begging vogue, please ask rihanna, nicki, beyonce and ariana grande to do this (and the 73 questions as well+& the 7 days 7 looks).
My best model love u kendall❤
